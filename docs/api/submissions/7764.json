No one under 18. But we have a lot of friends and relatives with children so we came up with what we thought was a great compromise.  \n\nWe arranged for the nursing rooms and the coffee area to be available at the church for anyone under 18.  And we included that on the invitations.  So mom's and infants could still watch the ceremony and older kids could stay glued to their phones without interrupting our wedding.  We even fot some church ladies to be available in the coffee area to help with any minor problems. \n\nAt the reception we arranged for a room at the hall to be made available for anyone under 18 and paid for some girls from the local high school to be there as babysitters since it wouldn't be fair to expect older kids to take care of the younger ones.  There was a tv in the room and we had Pixar movies running.  We also ordered pizza and pop for the whole group. Once again this was made very clear on the invitations.  \n\nBut we are still dealing with people who are mad at us for doing this.  My cousin is mad that her baby couldn't be at the ceremony.  Her baby is six and cannot go to McDonald's without having a fit.  \n\nSome of the older kids were pissed that they had to get dressed up to sit in a room. Then get their pictures taken. Then sit in another room. I have heard from a couple of my neices that they are upset with me for making them get dressed up but not letting them come to the wedding or reception. \n\nEvery time that is point out that I asked everyone not to bring their kids because they weren't going to be allowed at the ceremony or reception I get crapped on.  I feel like I was doomed either way.  I tried to compromise and now I'm still being called an asshole.\n\n#EDIT\n\nI didn't invite nthe children that came.  I did not ask the kids that showed up to dress up.  In no way, shape, or form did I insinuate that kids who dressed up would be allowed to come tomthe wedding or the reception.  When I said that the girls complained about getting dressed up it is because their parents made them dress up and blamed it on me.  They could have worn footie pajamas for all I cared.  They were included in the pictures because my grandmother asked.

This is seriously exceeding my own expectations of what a child free wedding with arranged childcare might look like. I say might because I've never heard of a bride being this cool about it.

Do not discuss it further with anyone, if they bring it up. Do not engage.", "NTA. Honestly the fact that you arranged childcare is super nice and generous. Lots of people choose to have child free weddings and I get it, screaming kids can totally mess up a wedding. You cared enough to do everything in your power to include your friends and relatives with young children so they could attend and not have to worry about their kids, I really see nothing wrong with that.", "NTA. Your set up fills me with rage cause I\u2019m imagining how fucking miserable 13 year old me would be stuck in a room with a bunch of screaming crying kids with nothing but my phone and pixar movies to entertain myself. BUT, I would have been pissed at my parents for bringing me when I\u2019m old enough to be home alone. That\u2019s not on you to accommodate kids that don\u2019t really need to be with their parents (none of it\u2019s on you, but especially that)\n\nThe set up sounds nice for the younger kids, and I\u2019m not sure what else parents would expect you to do without compromising what you wanted your wedding day to be.", "NTA and a child-free wedding sounds like heaven.", "NTA.

It was then incumbent upon the parents to make external child care arrangements if they weren't on board with your solution. I think you provided a reasonable solution to accomodate those who decided to bring their kids anyway. If the parents weren't happ or found your accomodation sub par, they should have just left the kids at home.", "NTA. If you want to go to events at which children are not allowed, and you don't want to pay for childcare, then don't have children. You cannot have all three of those things.\n\nYou went above and beyond by arranging an area for children at the venue.

We did not provide childcare.\n\nI wanted a loud ass party with an open bar, that's not a place for kids.

Me and my wife, we're happy as fuck.", "INFO: Did you ask that they be dressed up?", "NTA.

They could have left their kids at home.", "NTA\n\nYou made it clear on the invitation children under 18 were not allowed. It is those parents fault for making thier older kids get dressed up to just come sit in a room. Unfortunately they're making it totally your fault. Next time I would say \"I'm sorry you feel that way. However, I made it perfectly clear to your parents that kids under 18 were not allowed. Here, it says right here on the invitation.\" Then let the parents deal with it.", "NTA. What you did was extremely thoughtful and generous.

You gave an inch and they\u2019re mad they couldn\u2019t have the whole ruler.", "NTA. I have attended quite a lot of weddings over my years and have been a bridesmaid and maid of honor many times. As the bride, it\u2019s your decision to have or not have children under 18 at your wedding ceremony and reception. You even made the accommodations for your guests that they would not have to hire babysitters in order to attend your wedding. This was generous. I have been at weddings where no children under 18 were allowed, no exceptions. Other weddings had children allowed at the reception but not the ceremony. Others had children allowed at the ceremony but not the reception. \n\nUnfortunately children are not predictable in their behavior and as such can ruin weddings. Yes ruin them. I have seen at one reception where a little boy around 9 years old dressed in his suit, pull the white linen table cloth holding the wedding cake and other desserts, entirely off the table in a fit of rage. Everyone was surprised and the bride cried and the groom was horrified that their cake was on the floor and no photos would be taken of this special moment. What did the boys parents do? They said \u201cboys will be boys\u201d and laughed. Yeah. This was at the Four Seasons Hotel where his parents told the couple they were bringing their son and he is well behaved and would be good. They showed up with him even though children were not allowed. Yeah. So going back to what I wrote is that children\u2019s behavior are unpredictable and you cannot guarantee they will be well behaved and things can get out of hand quickly without supervision by their parents.", "NTA. I think you're being more accommodating than most.", "NTA - but I think you made the mistake of putting the responsibility of childcare on yourself and therefore became the target for people\u2019s grievances. I would\u2019ve just said \u201chey nobody younger than 18. Sorry but get a babysitter, workout a play date, I don\u2019t care. But this is how the wedding will be.\u201d Sure people would THEN complain you didn\u2019t provide any help. But those people are going to complain anyway so no point in pleasing them.", "NTA - Child free weddings are acceptable and you've gone above and beyond to make rules.  Personally I didn't want 12 and under, teens are not going to run around and ruin things.  Just know if you make rules, they have the right to say no.", "You're NTA. It sounds like you went over the top accommodating people with children. You did way more than most people do at their child free weddings.", "NTA. your wedding, your rules. you accommodated the needs of those who were underage and made it clear what was happening from the beginning through the invitation. people are just upset because they didn\u2019t get there way, but on your day, what they want doesn\u2019t matter. and if they can\u2019t respect your wishes on your wedding day, then that\u2019s their problem.", "INFO Why did they have to get dressed up for photos if they aren't part of the wedding?", "NTA. It's not your fault if people cannot read the invitations.", "NTA but having this on site was the problem - close enough to see but not allowed into the room? Not surprised the older ones got upset.\n\nThe plan was good but it should have been somewhere nearby not at the same venue", "I tried to arrange it the same as you did. No-one agreed beforehand, or were at least telling us they did not like that their children could not be at the ceremony and would be taken care of in another room. In the end we got married with our parents, our best friends and a photograpjer and his wife as the only guests lol. Of course every-one was not satisfied with that option either. But we were, it was a beautiful day. Life would get more difficult soon and we kind of knew that, so we made memory we could cherish.\nAnyway, NTA. You can't win these things I guess.", "NTA - People today feel that they are entitled to bring children, or even pets, anywhere they want.  YOU gave specific invites and even arranged for those who would need help in caring for the kids.  YOU are NTA!", "What the ...?!!!

Not slamming those who want to invite children to their weddings, but good grief, other people.  Not your event!\n\nGuests have **NO RIGHT** ***(ZERO!  NONE!)*** to complain or even to comment about the guest list.  That is a blazing breach of the most basic manners taught in KINDERGARTEN, brainiacs!!

Ignore the ungrateful complainers who were lucky to be invited and given such extra consideration by you.\n\nedited for spelling and verdict NTA", "NTA omg people kill me like how are their choices your fault?", "So you make accommodations so that your friends and family don't have to pay for babysitters or opt out of the wedding, and they still complained!\n\nNTA, but the ones complaining sure sound like TA. Honestly, if you have anymore complaints coming in, I'd seriously tell them they made the choice to use your accommodations instead of paying for a babysitter, you get what you get.", "I think its shitty to make them participate in pictures and such if you exclude them from your wedding. I've been there though and it's a tough line to walk. I just found out 6 years after we got married that my brother and his wife are done holding their grudge about their 4 year old daughter, at the time,  not being invited. I get it. I think being a tight family, people expect their children will be invited as well. A lotttt of people have trouble separating the fact that their kids are still kids, they aren't a part of them. My family is my unit, one for all, all for one type deal. I get feeling slighted that someone I love could invite me but can view my kid as separate for a wedding invitation. Probably at least half is married folk have been in your boat. It's shitty. There's capacity issues, there's cost issues, and a lot of times above all- there's the issue of having kids throw tantrums and fuck up your wedding that takes so much planning and shelling out $$$. I don't think you're an asshole for excluding kids at the wedding, that's part of life and your family will get over it. You actually went above and beyond by finding a good way to accommodate them- somewhere on the premises so worried parents can still check in on the kids. That's huge and great of you. I think the only way you could be an asshole is if you were still vague on the invite, although, if they're close enough to be giving you shit over I'd think you'd have talked about the situation before hand. \n-\u2010-------\n\nSomething like:\n\nMr, mrs., thing one and thing 2 you're invited to our wedding! We will have another rooms for the things to watch movies and eat pizza! Hope to see you there!\n\n-----\nThat checks the specifics you mentioned but also leaves it vague enough to assume the kids are invited. I could see being pissed if I made my kids get ready and done up to come a wedding to get stuck in a room for 6 hours and only allowed to come out when you want them included in pictures and nothing else. That'd be shitty. It should have said kids won't be included but we've got a room and sitters if you're not comfortable or unable to leave them behind for the night.\n\nSo I guess I'd say info, but if I had to choose I'd guess not TA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Second, I wouldn\u2019t have had the setup at the church near the wedding. People seem to think since the daycare space was close by kids were allowed but off to the side. Unfortunately, your level of care and understanding for parents was grossly misinterpreted because of the level of convenience you provided. Since it was all in the same building people thought kids could go and so they brought them. I think it was a great idea but people are greedy and dumb.", "I'd say yes but I love the idea. Own being an asshole it's your fucking wedding do what ya want", "NTA. I feel like you went above the norm for basically setting up a daycare for the night. It's the parents fault for not bringing a change of comfy clothes or letting them wear whatever.", "NTA", "NTA -- while I think you potentially should have opted for licensed childcare for such a mixed group, ultimately your wedding, your rules. And it sounds like parents had plenty of warning what to expect, so if they weren't comfortable with a teen babysitter for their kids, they should have left them home or made other arrangements.\n\nSome people are too selfish to see around their own wants and probably should have just stayed home.", "NTA - As you said, the only ones bothered about not having kids at the wedding are the adults themselves. The kids are bothered that they were forced to dress up for a single photoshoot especially since they would have seen Mr.Weeb with his hentai hoodie in the corner who was still a part of the picture.\n\nAs a teen I hated weddings solely because I had nothing to do except sit-around. Having a room where I could just chill on my phone would have been a godsend.", "NTA.\n\nImagine being expected to honor the wishes of two people getting married for a few hours. Suuuuuuuuch an inconvenience.", "NTA. This sounds awesome\u2026 weddings are long and boring and tiring for kids. My cousins and I would run off and talk and play anyways. You are not entitled to invite anyone to your wedding. These people are really disrespectful. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this. Congratulations on your wedding\ud83d\udc8d", "NTA", "NTA: You and your husband did everything possible to help your guest with children. Sometime there is no please people.", "You could have said on the invitation that anyone that shows up with children has a 1 drink maximum because they need to be responsible for their children.", "The only thing that makes you the AH is now every dad that was trying to stay home and babysit, now doesn\u2019t have an excuse.", "I think you went way above and beyond with the kids here. They should be upset with their parents for being dragged along dressed to the nines, thinking they could force your hand on the issue, instead of leaving them alone at home (if they're of age to be left alone of course). \n\nNTA.", "NTA. You went truly above and beyond.", "The *fuck*? You arranged a room for them, and bought them *pizza*?\n\nMake a list of the people who are giving you shit and *never give them anything ever again.* You don't need that sort of drama in your life.", "NTA.\n\nYou bent over backwards to accommodate a bunch of assholes who can't read or think they're the exception to the rules and they still bitched about it.", "NTA.\n\nA shame you spent so much for people to be so unappreciated.", "YTA \n. Teens are not children. Kind of crazy that you expected them not to come. I really can\u2019t think of a wedding where child free included 17 year olds\u2026", "I\u2019ve seen a lot of these lately. I\u2019ll say NTA so long as you didn\u2019t expect anyone to attend who did have kids. Cause frankly if I was invited to a child free wedding I would not RSVP.", "INFO: did you specifically tell teenagers that they were forced to sit in a separate room with small children the whole time and watch movies?", "Your comment gives me hope lol.  Currently in the midst of planning a child free wedding and starting to get major pushback.  Both fianc\u00e9 and I are teachers\u2014last thing we want is having to think about redirecting kids on our day off!", "JAWN!!!!!", "... Cool story. Not everyone wants little snot factories running around at their wedding.", "Which part do you think was the gross? The accommodation to all the parents by offering care, supervision and food for children? Or the part where the OP wants their wedding how they want?", ">But secondary schoolers shouldn\u2019t be excluded from the wedding. They are old enough to behave appropriately (and are hardly the only age group focussing on their phones).\n\n I beg to differ.  When my sister got married her SIL was 17 and the wedding planner had to confiscate her phone because she refused to stay off of it despite being in the wedding party.  Her mother swore up and down she'd be off of it in time to walk down the aisle, but nope, she had it out until the wedding planner took it from her and handed it to her mother as he walked by her.  She also tried to throw a fit when we made her go back inside after she got her hair done because it was *incredibly* windy outside and her hairstyle would have been ruined.  She was also busted by the bartender for trying to get a glass of wine for herself.", "Yeah, 18 seems life a high cutoff for a \"child-free\" wedding,  especially if they are relatives which I assume they are if grandma wanted them in pictures.", "This is not your decision. Period. She said no one under 18. That's it.", "OPs wedding OPs rules. She could set the age cut off at the age she decided on.\n\nThe 17 year olds weren't invited.\n\nIf their parents made them get dressed up and come to the wedding, then they should be miffed at their parents who KNEW their spawn were not invited and would not be allowed at the weeding or reception.", "No one said she would be AT the wedding. And your thoughts on age doesn't matter. Kid free means kid free. Most wouldn't do this. They just say no and leave it to parents to find sitters.", "Wife is a teacher. We had her kids at the ceremony and then had a Shirley Temple Hour for them with cotton candy, pretzels, a candy bar, and other stuff. Then when cocktail hour started, we kicked them all out. Don't bend!", "Don't cave. My husband and I had a childfree wedding last year and have ZERO regrets. I got some pushback from some people, but held firm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMultiple people told me after that it was the most fun they've ever had at a wedding.", "Adults do that at weddings all the time.", "I got drunk at a wedding at 14. Lol", "I\u2019m seriously contemplating an adult free wedding. Just me the fianc\u00e9 and our kids. I might invite the nephew, but the nephew\u2019s father, my fianc\u00e9\u2019s brother, can just sit in the coat closet while me and the fianc\u00e9 get hitched. I\u2019ll order him a Little Caesars and put on a football game. Should he be offended?\n\nOh shucks. My fianc\u00e9 just told me that his nephew turned 18 recently. I guess they can both sit in the coat closet and watch the game.", "The part where they were so self-absorbed that they excluded loved ones from their event as if those loved ones aren\u2019t important to them.", "The family pictures.....probably why the made them come.", "That's why I'm not having anyone under 21 at my wedding (the age gap in my family between cousins is large enough that there's no one close to that age, the oldest \"kids\" in my extended family have graduated college, and then the next set of kids are still in high school). But we did it this way because then no one can start drama about their kids drinking.", "Okay, here\u2019s my issue with this whole thing. I work wedding security and have probably been to 100 weddings in the last 8 months. It\u2019s IMO pretty douchey to make the kids that are like 14/15 and older but younger than 18 stay in the kids section. They\u2019re old enough at that point to not cause a disruption because they\u2019re self-aware. I can understand if it was a blanket protection for one weirdly loud 16 year old, but in general, kinda weird.\n\n\nAnd before people get on me cause she clearly said the kids weren\u2019t invited.. Seriously? You\u2019re not gonna invite your *niece* to your wedding? What\u2019s she gonna do lol? Make you too embarrassed to party hard?\n\n\nI went to my buddy\u2019s wedding recently and, while it was definitely more 18+, there were still kids and it didn\u2019t change the vibes at all. Drinking, dancing, and a helluva lot of fun. Most kids get tired and their parents take them home before the actual dancing even starts because most weddings follow the same format and end up with around 2-3 hours of open dancing at the end of the night.\n\n\nEven then, have an afterparty.\n\n\n\ntheir wedding, I know, and under 12-14ish I understand, but after that, they know how to act lol.", "What's tacky? Hahah", "Oh stop. Lmao.", "Before anyone asks, no, there\u2019s no bad feelings about the brother. He\u2019s always been perfectly nice to us. \n\nIt\u2019s just that I\u2019ve had bad experiences with adults before. Some - not all - don\u2019t know how to behave right. And I would just prefer that my special day not be tainted with adult drama.", "It's not about what YOU feel the age should be. She said no one under 18. Period the end.", "There has to be an age cut off and she chose 18.  If she would have picked 16, you would have said but 15 is the same only a year difference. The exact same as your doing now. When deciding child free, there has to be a cut off age to make it fair for everyone. People like you will always find a reason to be difficult!", "Where do they draw the line though? Assuming that there is a range, if you include a 17 year old, then why not 13-16? And what about the mature 8-12 year olds? \n\nIt would create too much drama, cutting it at 18 makes it easier to make the call.", "I dunno. She said no one under 18.  I assumed the \"had to get dressed up\" came from the parents. It was clear. VERY clear they weren't invited.", "And the only teens who would possibly care about being excluded would be younger siblings or someone else genuinely close to the people getting married, which usually isn\u2019t going to be a lot. Your average 16 year old does not care about going to the wedding of some extended family member they see at reunions now and then. Letting them stay home is probably doing them a favor.", "Wait. You had me nodding along until the last sentence.  How could OP providing emergency child-care make her become a target for people assuming their children were invited?  They knew their children were not issued an invitation. They knew ahead of time their children were not invited. No assumptions acceptable.  Those entitled guests didn\u2019t see the generous accommodations for children who weren\u2019t supposed to be there, until they arrived with those very children, themselves.  NObody to blame, but themselves.", "She clearly stated what the kids under 18 would be doing. Inference skills are hard to\nCome by.", "I remember when I was a teenager most of my peers complained about going to weddings, unless it was immediate family or an adult they were super close to.", "That\u2019s on their parents, not on OP.", "OP says \"We arranged for the nursing rooms and the coffee area to be available at the church for anyone under 18. And we included that on the invitations.\"\n\nIt sounds like the details of the kids room were included on the invite. The parents knew there would be somewhere to stick their kids as opposed to being turned away at the door with their kids. That would encourage them to bring them instead of pay for a baby sitter.", "I mean most comments seem to understand what she meant.....", "Lol I didn\u2019t want to go to my aunts wedding and I got forced", "Most teenagers don't want to go to a wedding that will not have any of their friends there", "I would cut it at being in high school.", "But my 13 year old is so mature!! It\u2019s not fair to exclude them when kids one year older than them are included. \n\nYou can cut off the age anywhere you want. Choosing 18 doesn\u2019t make OP the AH. People would be upset no matter what age cut off they picked."]}
