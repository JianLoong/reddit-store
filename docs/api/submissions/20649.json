One of the girls in the group asked why I\u2019m wearing florals when we\u2019re supposed to wear black, I said my dress is still black too just with floral print. Then when we were having group photos taken one of the girls who organised it looked annoyed & said the photos look off as everyone is wearing full black & the bride is in the middle wearing colour but with a random floral print taking away attention. \n\nLater I confided with another girl saying I don\u2019t see why it was a big deal, it\u2019s just a hen party & I didn\u2019t think it needed to be that strict. She said it\u2019s not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but it also wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal for me to just wear black like instructed, that everyone owns black & it was chosen to make things easy but it seemed like I was being difficult for the sake of it by purposefully choosing a print.", "created_utc": 1687788785, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14jigic/aita_for_wearing_a_floral_dress_to_a_hen_party/", "score": 6405, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am not someone who thinks every single whim of a bride needs to be catered to, but wearing all black is pretty simple and the explanation is easy to understand. What I don't understand how you could interpret \"all black\" as \"clothes with some black in it.\"\n\nIf I had been in your place, I would have been absolutely mortified that the entire group managed to correctly interpret the instructions and I messed things up. And that I ruined the plan for the whole party. So mortified that I would've apologized profusely and tried to make it right. I probably would've offered to be the photographer all night so I wasn't in the pics.\n\nEdited: I could've sworn the post said they were supposed to wear \"all black\", but I checked again and it just says black. The point is the same though. I think most people interpret \"wear this color\" as \"wear ONLY this color\".", "YTA\n\nInstructions seemed pretty damn clear and you seem to be the only one who didn\u2019t get it and not follow it to the letter, so that\u2019s on you.\n\n\u201cWear black\u201d does not mean \u201coh so long as the *base* is black anything goes*", "YTA - I personally find the dress code a little ridiculous but there was a dress code none the less. You were supposed to wear black, not black *with* etc.", "YTA\n\nYou answered your own question in the title - it was requested you wear black, and you describe your own dress as floral. Weird move.", "YTA...I think it's ridiculous, but you sort of agree to these things if you're participating.  You knew what they wanted and then didn't do it.", "Light YTA\n\n\"It's not a big deal in the grand scheme of things\", that is totally true... But come on, it's not hard to follow what was a simple and non-extravagant dress code to an event you were invited to (i.e., you weren't the one to decide the rules of the event).", "While petty, YTA.  Y'all agreed to a dress code, you broke the dress code.", "YTA - there's a big difference between a black dress and a flowered dress.  You didn't care to follow the dress code because the event wasn't important to you, which is an asshole move.", "YTA \n\n\nThey gave the reasoning for it, which was so the bride stood out. It wasn't just \"wear black as a theme\".\n\n\nIf everyone wore a print with a black background, there is literally nothing the bride could wear (obviously within the realm of normal clothing, not flashing neon signs), that would make her stand out.", "YTA. Seems like you have main character syndrome. Instructions were clear. I saw in one of the comments you posted a link to the dress. I think it definitely was an attention grab. Straight up the bride should have worn that.  Would look great in pictures with everyone else in all black. \n\nJust in case you are unaware OP, for the wedding, only the bride wears white or any other variation of white.", "You don\u2019t see what the big deal is because you\u2019re selfish. Fundamentally.\n\nYou don\u2019t see what the big deal is, so it\u2019s not a big deal. Step outside your selfishness and consider what the bride wanted, that she\u2019ll have these pictures for the rest of her life. It\u2019s a big deal for her. Everyone realized that, but not you for the singular reason given already \n\nYTA.", "Eh, even if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s important it was to them. I think YTA. It\u2019s not like anyone was all that rude to you about it. Sorry that you misunderstood it.

More like you're a numpty, very soft YTA but not to be nasty to OP because it seems like it was a genuine mistake \n\nThough, when someone says everyone needs to wear black, minus 1 person who can wear colour, my mind does go to ALL BLACK outfits.", "I don't know why you're getting so many Y T A judgements. If the instructions were just \"wear black\" I think I might have deemed a black floral dress ok to wear as well, although I definitely would have been much more embarrassed about my choice after finding out that EVERYONE else interpreted it as \"wear all solid black\".\n\nSo NTA for that, but that being said if you were instructed to wear solid black and you wore floral anyway, you'd be kind of an asshole for that.", "NTA if that was the most appropriate thing in your closet.  If you had solid black as an option and the invite clearly said ALL black, maybe YTA.  If the invite just said \"please wear black\" and this was primarily black with neutrals, I do think that is a bit ambigous.  \n\nThat said, the only strict mandtory dress requirements should be for the bridal party ON the wedding day.   Trying to micromanage adults for multiple events for the aesthetics of your instagram posts is just dumb IMO.   How about being grateful people showed up and probably had to spend money to be part of the event?", "Floral dresses at hen parties? How dare you!\" - Said no one ever. NTA.", "INFO: What was the wording of the request? You paraphrase it as \"requested we all wear black,\" where \"all\" modifies \"we,\" but it makes a world of difference whether the organizers said e.g. \"the party should all wear black\" vs. \"the party should wear all black.\"", "YTA. All black means all black. Especially Ta for doubling down and whining to another girl to get her to agree with you so you could feel less TA", "As stupid as I find the idea of color-coordinated outfits for a hen night, YTA. I would have assumed your non-compliance was an intentional statement. You knew they were requesting bright colors for the bride and black for everyone else, and you selected bright colors to wear. Claiming \"but it's got black in it!\" strikes as disingenuous quibbling.\n\nAs stupid as the drama may be (and it IS stupid drama), you instigated it with your sartorial choice for the night. But I'm sure you stood out, which is honestly what you wanted, isn't it?", "YTA\n\nYou knew the request and chose to go off and do your own thing instead, for whatever reason.", "ESH. I'm sorry but demanding people buy new shit they might not wear again for anything beyond the actual wedding is too fucking much. All these people concerned more about how the photos look are ridiculous. \n\nThat being said you should have just not gone or should just accept that the bride at least is going to see you as an asshole.", "YTA. They asked for black, you didn't wear just black.\n\nAre her requirements odd? Yes, but it's her function. If you didn't agree you didn't have to go, so YTA.", "Your outfit didn't ruin the bride's day, their ego did.", "YTA in this situation. your friend is right on the grand scheme it\u2019s not a big deal at all.

That's on you.   \n\nThe rules weren't too crazy on this one so yeah... follow the rules for your friend.", "I don\u2019t have an all black dress or outfit at the moment and would be annoyed if I had to purchase one just for a hen party/bachelorette. That being said, I would have run it by the bride first- maybe she\u2019d realize that her idea of all black is a bit much.", "Floral dresses at hen parties? How dare you!\" - Said no one ever. NTA.", "Going against the grain. NAH. Sounds like it was a mistake because it\u2019s a hen party, not a funeral. \n\nTo keep the peace, I\u2019d offer a photoshop session to make your dress all black.", "YTA. Ah yes, the strict pageantry of wedding bullshit. The invite was clear. If you didn't want to wear all black you shouldn't have gone.\n\nBlack as a base was \"on theme\"? ***\\*SIGH\\****", "YTA as much as I don\u2019t like assigning costumes to guests or using them as props, you chose to attend and then deliberately ignored the very easy request to wear black. While it\u2019s not a big deal as you say, it is also the sort of thing people tend to remember and internalize about others. I\u2019d remember you as a difficult person who couldn\u2019t stand to just go along for even one night - not the best look.", "ESH\n\nIt's obvious what they were going for and it wouldn't have been hard to wear all black.\n\nBut also, you had to coordinate outfits for a simple party? Parties are for the attendees to bond and have fun, not to produce *aesthetic* photos for social media. I guarantee, no one outside the friend group cares about the pictures and now there's all this drama among friends for no reason. Seems really stupid to me.", "Light YTA. \n\nDress code was black. It\u2019s not difficult to figure out that that means black. Not other colours. If you weren\u2019t sure a quick call/message also wouldn\u2019t have been difficult.", "YTA. Did they say only black? If not, technically you where correct. But you should have checked. NGL, i think their theme was a bit depressing, as black is generally for funerals. But to each their own.", "I'm going with ESH. \n\nI dont like demands like this \"wear xyz to a party\" (that is not a costume party) because \"the bride has an aesthetic in her head\". People aren't fucking props.\n\nBut since it was done, you suck for not following a simple instruction like \"wear black\"", "NTA. The organizers of the bachelorette should have ordered everyone matching shirts if they wanted everyone to look so precise. You wore black but it had a print. Still was black. They should have planned better if the photo was so important. I say this as someone who has been to a lot of bachelorette parties/trips. When people want a photo like this (which is common), the party orders shirts. If they wanted *solid* black *only* they should have said so. Also the floral print is likely not distracting from the bride in the pics as much as they think.", "YTA Hopefully you don\u2019t put \u201cGood at following basic instructions\u201d on your resume.", "YTA. \u201cHey everyone look at me!\u201d", "[removed]", "YTA. A floral dress with black background is not a black dress. You could have wore plain black but chose not to. You should have not gone if you couldn't follow the one request.", "NTA. How many special days does a bride get anyway? It's dumb to make dress codes for events like this, and it's unfair to expect people to purchase additional outfits for every event.", "I may be in the minority, but probably NTA. For context- I had a black and white bridal shower. Many women came in just that- black and white. Several were in all black. My pictures may not have been perfectly uniform but I didn\u2019t want people to buy anything new just for one day. I think your intention behind it matters, too. Did you consider other options/did you have an all black dress?", "Info: did you ever apologize for. Clearly misunderstanding the request?", "YTA the girl you confided in told you everything you needed to know , I think you came here because you didn\u2019t like the answer. But you\u2019re going to hear it 100x more here", "Meh, \u00feey\u2019ll get over it.", "INFO, could you have worn black like asked and chose not to?", "I\u2019d edit the dress to be black lol", "YTA that dress is floral not black, how did you not understand the written directions.", "Gonna be the odd man out here and say NTA. If they wanted solid black they should have specified, but you also should have known by the description \"so the bride stands out in something colorful\" that having colorful flowers on your black dress was not going to be okay. It also doesn't matter literally at all and the organizer and other guests should get over it. It doesn't sound like the bride cared at all from your description.", "INFO: can you show us a picture of the dress? It\u2019s hard to judge without knowing whether the dress is dominated by the floral pattern or if it\u2019s more subtle.\n\nTo be fair I do think it\u2019s effing bizarre to ask everyone to dress for a bachelorette party like it\u2019s a funeral, but still curious to what extend you adhered to the dress code.", "Soft YTA. On one hand a mandatory dress code for a bachelorette party seems a little rigid. On the other hand, I can actually see how the dress code would help identify the participants as being \u201cmembers\u201d of the group, which can enhance the experience if you\u2019re going out to clubs/bars, as well as make for better photos, etc.", "Info : do you own an all black dress?\n\nWas there a reason you chose a floral dress?", "YTA: it\u2019s not that hard to get a black dress. It is one think to mistakenly not realize that solid black was the color scheme. But it also feels like your doubling down after your mistake instead of gracefully admitting you messed up and didn\u2019t realize.", "YTA. I hope you have other friends because every single one of these other women saw you try to upstage the bride at her bachelorette and will not be inviting you to theirs.", "YTA. You should have checked about wearing the florals. If it was \u201cwear black the bride is in white\u201d the floral might\u2019ve been okay but it wouldn\u2019t have taken very long or much effort to just check.", "YTA", "I think all this pettiness at wedding events turns everyone into the AH!  We have attended a dozen weddings and hosted a few in the last several years that had no such drama at all.  People came, enjoyed the ceremonies, enjoyed the reception and had a great time.  Is it any wonder divorce is so common now?", "YTA. You were given instructions, it\u2019s not your day and yet you made it about you. Whether bc you stood out not wearing all black or bc everyone was talking about how you weren\u2019t wearing black, YOU took away from the bride.\n\nApologize to her and next time, learn how to follow instructions. It is a big deal.", "The fact that you knew the point of the dress code was to make sure the bride stands out makes this a *hard* YTA. It was a very simple dress code put in place so you guys could get some fun pre wedding photos and you deliberately called attention to yourself and away from the bride by \"misunderstanding\" an easy dress code.", "YTA. they ask you to wear black, so wear black. are you going to wear white to the wedding, or off white? shame on you.", "YTA.  You decided to do your own thing rather than following the hosts' request.", "If this was about you wearing a black top but not owning black pants, or earing navy bc you didn't have black, thats one thing. Buy you opted to completely stand out. YTA. This event wasn't about you. But now it is.", "Was N T A but changing it to YTA   after I saw the dress.   That's not just a little floral.\n\n~~But if your friend spends the rest of her life looking at her hen party pictures with a pout, she deserves it.  Because PICTURES are not the event and people shouldn't have to worry about dressing like a cast member of some \"reality show\" to attend a party.~~\n\nI really hate the trend of pictures taking precedence over the actual event.  Like it doesn't matter if anyone had a good time or the event was well planned, just that everyone \"followed the dress code\".", "I don\u2019t like wearing dresses period. However I dress masculine rather than feminine. That said couldn\u2019t you have found something black that day? Didn\u2019t have to be a dress.", "YTA - you knew she wanted to wear color. It\u2019s really common for the attendees of hen parties to wear something different from the bride. Do I think it\u2019s necessary, no but it\u2019s one simple ask.", "YTA you were told it was because the bride was going to wear something colorful so you know they wanted her to stand out. They also said wear black. That didn't say wear something mostly black, or with a black background. I noticed you even describe it as a floral dress so you knew it wasn't the same as wearing a black dress. It sounds like you chose to misinterpret the dress code just so you could wear what you wanted.\n\nIt may not be annoying to adhere to a dress code and it may not be a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but it was a big deal to at least the organizers of the party.", "YTA\n\nYou were told to wear ***black*** so the bride could the the only one wearing ***color***.\n\nThey should have had you on the end of the photos so you could be cropped out.  \n\nYou did this to stand out.  You knew the purpose of the color combos.", "YTA \nThey should have asked to step away when they were taking pictures.", "No matter how silly any of us find the dress code thing, it was very simple: wear black so that the bride stands out. \n\nYTA", "YTA for sure. Might be a good opportunity for some soul-searching as to why you just HAD to defy the dress code when complying would have taken the same amount of effort but not upset anyone", "YTA- yes i agree i find this type of dress code stuff annoying but how difficult would it be to just wear all black?", "Yta for not realizing floral print is colorful and the bride was supposed to be the only colorful one.", "Yta is it an annoying dress code? Yes! Absolutely!  But 'wear black so the bride stands out by wearing colors' means WEAR BLACK. Not black and colors.", "Y T A Why mess up a good thing for your friends? Being part of the group means accommodating their wishes. I hope they toss a \u201chen party\u201d for your nuptials and they all show up wearing black with black veils. Be funny on your own time.", "YTA come on, man. It was one evening. You couldn't conform to a fun thing for one evening?", "YTA.\n\nYou described it twice as a \u201cfloral dress\u201d. Again as a \u201cfloral print\u201d. Not a black dress. You could have gone with black trousers and a black top, but no.", "YTA \n\nHaving seen the picture you posted of a similar dress I have to ask. Are you that starved for attention and will you be wearing white to the wedding?", "YTA You think you\u2019re the main character don\u2019t you?", "NTA\n\nI have no idea who all these people are saying \u201cwear black\u201d obviously means \u201cwear only black.\u201d The only dress I\u2019ve ever had that was all black was a choir uniform. I don\u2019t have any tops that are all black. Is it normal for people to have solid black outfits?", "NAH  I'd chalk it up to different expectations.  Communication from the planner should have stated  \"Solid Black, no prints or patterns\" if that was the expectation.", "YTA", "YTA\nWhy didn\u2019t you just wear black?", "YTA. \n\nYou could have just worn black. You didn\u2019t need to be so difficult.", "YTA.  Your first paragraph alone says you knew the purpose of the dress code\u2026.the bride was to stand out in color.

It said \u201call black\u201d and that the bride would be colorful. So you chose something mostly colorful with a black background. \u201cBlack background\u201d is not the same as \u201call black.\u201d When clothing is all black there is no background. It\u2019s black. \n\n I\u2019m not sure why you thought your choice \n was correct.", "YTA. \n\nThe instructions were clear that the only one wearing color should be the bride. \n\nI don't necessarily agree with mandating a dress code for something like this, but it doesn't matter - you accepted the invitation and by doing that, agreed to the dress code. \n\nAnd in looking at the link you provided to give an idea of the dress (that comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14jigic/comment/jplbxj1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), the dress clearly doesn't come close to adhering to the dress code.

Don't steal the bride's limelight.", "YTA.", "Lol, YTA, and you know it bc you delivered way too much explanation about how the dress is technically black (but with colors, yk). The only thing that was not in your post is why you choose to go against the dress code except of thinking it was too strict - but if you really disapproved of it, why not rejecting the invite to the hen party?\n\nBut just to make this clear for the next event in this wedding: if the wedding invite says \"wedding attire\" - this does NOT mean you as a guest should wear a wedding dress ;)", "A friend of mine had the exact same theme for her hen party. I also didn't wear a completely black dress (white in it) but I made sure to asks the friend who organized the whole thing if it was OK.

Sheesh.", "YTA. Keep the girl around that you confided in at the end of the night... because she seems to have pretty good insight into the situation. In the grand scheme of things, no, it isn't such a big deal.. However, it is pretty telling about you as a person and the value (or lack there of) you place on friendships (or maybe certain friendships). If it was such a little thing, why did you have such a big problem just going along with it? We don't do things for others in life because they are easy for us... or even because they are necessarily logical. We do things for others because we care about them and one of the simplest ways to show someone you care about them is with your actions. \n\nIf you were uncertain about the intention of what \"we all wear black\" actually meant, I am pretty confident you could have sent a text or email to the organizer to confirm what they meant. You didn't though, and, more often than not, people do that so they can later claim they weren't sure. What it comes down to is that you put yourself above your friends over an absolutely trivial thing. You see it as trivial, but that is why it is so telling to others... it was something so easy to accommodate, but you decided that what you wanted to do was more important.", "YTA, I'm going to a bachelorette party in September with the same dress code: everyone except for the brides in black. I actually don't own much black (in fact I own exactly one black dress, and it's covered in pink flowers), so I'm going to have to go shopping at some point to find a black dress because nothing I currently own fits the bill.

One of the girls in the group asked why I\u2019m wearing florals when we\u2019re supposed to wear black, I said my dress is still black too just with floral print. Then when we were having group photos taken one of the girls who organised it looked annoyed & said the photos look off as everyone is wearing full black & the bride is in the middle wearing colour but with a random floral print taking away attention. \n\nLater I confided with another girl saying I don\u2019t see why it was a big deal, it\u2019s just a hen party & I didn\u2019t think it needed to be that strict. She said it\u2019s not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but it also wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal for me to just wear black like instructed, that everyone owns black & it was chosen to make things easy but it seemed like I was being difficult for the sake of it by purposefully choosing a print.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The event in this post sounds like a bridal shower. Then there are the bachelor and bachelorette parties. Those are not for family but just friends. They can get kinda rowdy and generally involve alcohol. However they can really vary depending on the person, but are generally just for friends. Like some people go to strip clubs, bar hopping, things like that, some are a weekend trip (that\u2019s a newer trend), and lots of other things. Then you have the rehearsal dinner, which is where everyone in the wedding kinda does a practice run and then there is a dinner following. Then finally the wedding.

Like, I'm a little confused why they wanted it to look like this was a funeral for the bride to be, but it's what they wanted. So you suck it up and do it in confusion or you make your excuses and don't go.", "That\u2019s definitely a floral dress with a black drop. Of", "Half the population is dumber than the median intelligence, not necessarily the average.", "100%, any normal person would have gone to change or realized they were the only one who didn\u2019t follow instructions and apologized. OP just dug in with \u201cI don\u2019t think I did anything wrong you\u2019re all overreacting blah blah blah\u201d", "I wouldn\u2019t call it a staple for some people. I\u2019m very pale wearing dark colors makes me look like a ghost. An all black dress would be a waste since I would never wear it.", "Yeah, that\u2019s completely fair actually.", "Maybe she is jealous of the bride.  \u201cJust a hen party\u201d.  Sounds like she doesn\u2019t like the bride.  Or the host.  Or anybody.", "I'm sitting here wondering how a woman has no LBD. I thought it was a staple.", "This, if the instructions just said wear black that\u2019s one thing but when it\u2019s wear black so the bride stands out then obviously they\u2019re thinking solid black", "\u201cwear black so I can be the only one wearing color\u201d heavily implies NO OTHER COLORS even if it doesn\u2019t specify \u201call black\u201d. it\u2019s clearly supposed to be everyone else in all black, so clearly no one else misunderstood.", "And you know even if this was confusing she could have i don\u2019t know \u2026 asked ?", "That\u2019s exactly the way to describe it. Someone in my wedding also had main character syndrome and I had to be way more strict than I wanted to be about any plans because of them. Other wedding party members were confused/shocked enough at their choices to reach out to my husband and I about them. There is a non-zero chance the bride not only knew OP has main character syndrome but explicitly tried to work around it.\n\nETA: I see now OP said the bride didn\u2019t plan the party. The person who planned may have known about the main character syndrome and was trying to help the bride feel special. YTA big time.", "Luckily no one's bachelorette party is compulsory.", "That\u2019s embarrassing - definitely does not fit the dress code and would be very distracting.", "Black is the easiest thing to go shopping for and to do it on a budget.", "I know 10 year olds who would get it right?", "There\u2019s definitely a subset of British people who think these types of things are gawdy and rude.  Like the concept of a baby shower was baffling to my British MIL because how dare you ask for gifts before the baby is born. The younger generation there has embraced it but not everyone. It\u2019s actually quite weird how culturally different they are to the US (for me at least)", "Tbf my wife and I didnt treat our hen do as something grand, it was just a small get together with our friends, and dress codes for weddings/hen-dos are cringe, so I get \"just a hen party\" attitude", "That\u2019s the point", "Agree, but even if you do think it's strict, you have that conversation before.", "I\u2019ve seen other women turn up in white to a wedding. Unbelievable.", "It'd obviously not a staple for someone who doesn't own one.", "My girls did this. I wore white and in the pictures we took it looked quite classy. But this was not my request, they organized it on their own. I actually saw everyone dressed and questioned if I should be wearing black lol.", "I don't! I just don't wear plain black. I've got a black floral dress, a black polka dot dress, and a black dress with gold stars, but nothing just plain black. Black graphic tees, a black undershirt that's specifically for under other brighter things..... But nothing plain black. Just not my thing. I don't generally buy clothes just in case I might need them some day, and if I don't truly love a piece of clothing I generally don't buy it because if I do it'll just sit in my closet for 3ish years until I donate it just to clear space. \n\nThat being said, if etiquette calls for it, even if I know I'd never wear it again, I'd probably go buy something all black and just whine about it to my husband later lol.", "Stop playing the victim Noone thinks a colored print is OK at something like this\n\nYTA\n\nUnfortunately for you it screams \"I'm jealous I'm not getting attention or married\" vibe with or without that being the cause", "Yeah, unfortunately something that was trivial for you sounds like it was quite important to the hen.\n\nEveryone else managed to follow through except you. \n\nA 30 second phone call to the hens bestie might have been the right thing to do and would have confirmed to you the importance of adhering to the request and saved the embarrassment. I'll add that if you didn't feel embarrassed about it then or now, then yes YTA.", "YTA-This was not rocket science. You chose to complicate a simple request.", "YTA\nYou knew the bride wants all the attention -> you wore dress, that screams attention", "Floral on black is not all black. You knew this but did it anyway. You could of also given the bride a heads up before attending.\n\nNo it\u2019s not a big deal in the grand scheme of things. But it was a big deal to the bride. Who invited you to her party. If you didn\u2019t want to wear all black you didn\u2019t have to go. \n\nYTA", "you are definitely an asshole. You could also be stupid.", "YTA. Why do you need to find a \u201cloophole\u201d instead of just following a simple instructions. I don\u2019t think the rule is ridiculous and it\u2019s quite common to want to have a theme for special occasions.", "YTA uh oh pick me alert", "Yes, you're the asshole.", "YTA.", "YTA. You know that \u201cblack means black. How do you not have a LBD? Or even black slacks, jeans, etc blouses, tops, hell a cami?", "Yes you are the ah. It was really a very simple dress code to follow", "Sorry but YTA the whole point of you wearing black was so the bride stood out, now you also stood out. Are you saying you didn\u2019t have one solid black dress to wear?", "First of all: Not everyone owns black clothes. \n\nThat being said, I was invited to a Bachelorette Party 2 weeks ago with the exact same instructions you got, everyone wear black except the bride to be. Now i literally do not own anything black made for this heat. So what did I do? Made a counteroffer jokingly to all wear pink and purchased a black dress online for 20\u20ac. \n\nIt is really not that hard to follow simple requests, therefore YTA", "Yta coulda changed.  And how long have chickens been partying bet they drink bud light.", "YTA. You knew the dress code. We need a picture of the dress now.", "Which Asian countries?", "It's perfectly acceptable to wear a dress with a print on a white background. This is getting so crazy that if you have a sliver of white, you're upstaging the bride. An all-white fancy dress is a no-no but white is not banished except for the bride. This is so ridiculous and it's the height of self-centeredness and selfishness to think any white is the same as bridal white. If they didn't specify ALL black, I might have done the same thing as I rarely wear solid colors head to toe.", "Eh, not British, but where I'm from they refer to it as a hen party, and yeah, bachelorette parties I'm not familiar with, but from your reaction they sound like a much bigger deal than hen parties typically are. For better insight into what a hen party is like, my sister's one consisted of eating thai food, doing some pottery, and chatting on the living room floor/playing some games. Honestly, I've never heard of a hen party being so extravagant as to even ask for formal-wear let alone a specific dress-code, so I could understand how casual OP was about it. Obviously the bride wasn't as casual. OP's still TA though, it's not that hard to follow simple rules."]}
