Infact, my school gives us a \"report card\" of sorts in which each teacher writes personal messages to us and our parents and according to this report I was doing this. \n\nSometimes he'd even allow us to outright leave class early. Multiple people did this as well as me. It wasn't a problem according to him.\n\nThis was all well until today when he just outright told me I had failed his subject and that I had to attend extra classes during the summer in order to pass.\n\nI was very, very mad. I didn't outright yell at him or anything but I went to speak with the teacher aide and told him it was unfair that I had failed the class when it was never brought to my attention that the teacher thought I had to do extra work.\n\nHe then accompanied me in order to have a conversation with the teacher, in which I accidentally spilled that he let us skip classes. My PE teacher of course denied this. I'm conflicted because he was very nice to us but he also outright failed me without any prior notice.\n\nEDIT: A whole lot of people appear to be assuming I'm lying and whatnot. I will disclose some more information since a comment said it would be easier to understand my situation if I did. There's a lot more info in my replies though.\n\nI'm 16 years old.\n\nPE class in my school takes place outside of the school, on a gym a bunch of blocks away. Leaving class is just the same as leaving the building.\n\nThere were about ~5-7 other people apart from me and the other two guys who failed who stopped showing up to class, some even missing even more classes than me yet still passed. I believe that they weren't failed simply because they sucked up to the teacher.\n\nMy teacher outright DISMISSED class at points. He did not simply allow us to leave, he dismissed us and told us not to tell anyone.\n\nI am not american and english is not my first language. I apologize for any mistakes I made since I may have not selected the right words while writing this.\n\n\nEDIT: I have reached a conclusion and I agree with the ESH voters the most. I will work on myself and put more effort into class even when the teacher isn't exactly a role model. On the other hand, what my teacher did (dismissing class, allowing us to leave early & maybe allowing some students to pass just because they sucked up to him) was wrong and I should not feel bad about accidentaly telling a teachers aide about it.

He didn't \"allow you to skip classes\" - as evidenced by the fact that when you skipped the class, you failed. He just didn't chase you down and drag you back when you skipped.

I just think I'm entitled to a \"You should work harder if you want to pass\" in the report he wrote for me two weeks before failing me y'know?", "The title including the word \"skip\" was a mistake on my part. Sorry, english is not my first language. I showed up to most of the classes but slacked off or only participated for a bit.

My favorite was bowling and yoga.", "This really comes down to whether it's college or high school.\n\nIf it's high school, he's being negligent by letting you just leave whenever, and it's part of his job to make sure you're where you need to be and doing what you're supposed to be doing.\n\nIf this is college, of course he's not going to stop you're you're supposed to be a grown ass person making your grown ass decisions about your life. I'm in a master's program now, and if I just get up and leave partway through a class, even really important classes, my teachers will just let go without saying anything.\n\nAlso, you do realize you've said this isn't a \"I won't force you do do anything\" approach, and immediately after that say he didn't even try to force you to do more?", "The students that passed just played football or whatever sport they wanted. A few who also slacked off also passed somehow. Some people just stopped showing up to class altoghether during an entire month and still passed lmfao.", "I'm not sure what a B means since I'm not american.

If a kid gets hit by a car when they are supposed to be at PE, the school is gonna be in a mess. And your middle of the semester progress note shouldn't say you're doing fine (although earlier you said you participated all but the last month, so this seems contradictory).\n\n\nPeople are comparing it to college, but high school is joint responsibility between students and teachers.", "I'm aware college is totally different. However, I'm in highschool and he shouldn't have allowed us to outright leave class and I should have gotten some kind of notice saying I should work harder if I want to pass considering it's literally his job to write a report stating how I'm doing in his class.", "I'm sorry but I'm supposed to meet the teachers expectations in order to pass. If I'm constantly told I can slack off and not get any notice whatsoever then I'll assume I met them.", "He didn't outright tell me that I'd pass. But he literally told us that it was fine if we didn't participate.", "If I shouldn't have passed then I should have atleast been told I was not doing enough to pass. I received an official report from the teacher saying I was doing fine lmfao. If the teacher essentially tells me slacking off is fine then I'll take my chance.", "I'm not sure what most of these terms mean so I apologize in advance if I misinterpret anything.\n\nMy issue is that he basically stated that it was okay to slack off, told me I was doing fine in my report card and then randomly failed me and 2 other people when there were around ~7 more others who literally just stopped showing up.", "Nearly every class. That's around once or twice a week considering we have PE class two days per week.", "Sure I did. However he failed at doing his job and should get reprimanded for basically just not teaching.", "Was it as extreme? Either way seems like you should fail as you did not do the work.", "How do you know this for sure?", "In that case NTA - and stand your ground.", "I read some of your other comments. I feel like you are adding on/changing your story now to make the teacher look guilty.", "Clearly not enough. Its ridiculous to slack off the majority of the time, and expect to pass.", "I think you should make a good faith effort to work things out with the teacher (being careful about your own admissions of wrongdoing which could be used against you).\n\nHowever since the teacher either had a sudden change of heart or is being unreasonable, you should absolutely take that report to the principal/administration and contest your failing grade. You shouldn't go out of your way to rat out your teacher but he is responsible for creating the situation in the first place so he should be prepared to handle the fallout.", "I would have a private discussion in that case with your school principal. If you feel you\u2019ve been unfairly graded, they can probably look in to your attendance records or possibly speak with other students in the class to see if there are others being graded unfairly", "Was it the same thing to the same extent though?", "Found OP's other account!", "If OP isn't in class, they don't know how much the others skipped. Seems like the other students read the room much better and didn't skip as much.", "There are some schools that give PE credit for sports, marching band, and ROTC. Those extracurricular activities sometimes require 0 periods or practices after school. My sister (marching band) had to go in 3 weeks before school started to practice for 4 hours a day. The football players were also there practicing.\n\nUnless you have irrefutable proof that the students who passed did exactly the same as you, there's really no way to know if it was unfair.

If you have an A on every assignment, you can expect to earn an A for the class. You can't expect to do nothing and pass. \n\nWould it be fair to the students who actually did something to get the same grade as you? \n\nIf you skip other classes or leave early, what do those teachers do?", "Ok, so this is simply strange and surely doesn\u2019t seem fair.", "a B is second highest grade.", "pretty sure the other class skippers who passed doing the same amount of work are thinking \u201csucks to be you ha ha!\u201d", "Life is 100% different and you will get absolutely nowhere with your attitude that you have. Stop being entitled. You deserved to fail.

He should be reprimanded if he\u2019s letting you out 30 minutes early regularly (unless that is the built in time for returning to the school building, which it doesn\u2019t sound like it is)\n\nHowever, that really is a separate issue. If you were participating during the 30 minutes that he WAS teaching, you would have passed. A warning would have been nice, but you made your decision and earned your grade.", "Yes, it was just as extreme as my case. I didn't slack off for the whole year though, it was just this month. Meanwhile a bunch of people just stopped showing up to class outright and they still pass.\n\nThe only noticeable difference is that the ones that passed and did nothing sort of \"befriended\" the teacher by chatting with him in class and whatnot. Meanwhile me and the other 2 guys who failed were more on the quiet side. I have started believing this is what led me to get failed lol, he might've thought I was being rude or something. I'm not sure.", "Because I went to a majority of the classes and saw that a whole lot of people just stopped showing up or were just slacking off like me. \n\nI also asked a bunch of friends and they had missed even more classes than me yet still passed.", "Where do you see conflicting parts in my story?\n\nMost of my replies are in comments where people asked for info. Idk what you expect me to do? Just not add any context even when they're asking me to??", "Of course it wasn't enough seeing he failed me.

I only used reddit for asking questions like once a month. All of my other accounts are named burner or throwaway followed by random numbers. I don't know why half the comments here have turned into this conspiracy of me lying to convince you guys that I'm in the right. I'm not lying nor am I creating accounts to make me look better. I just wanted peoples' opinion in order to make a proper judgement.", "The attitude that I have is that I should be warned if I'm doing something wrong SPECIALLY if I can be led to believe that what I'm doing is enough by previous statements my teacher made.", "The teacher is suppossed to communicate the schools' expectations.\n\nI did not skip the class most of the time. I worked some classes, others I slacked off. Plus I was told I was doing fine by the teacher in a report card, if I'm never told I'm not meeting said expectations and, in fact, I'm told I am meeting them then I shouldn't change my attitude.", "I thought I was doing the minimum since I wasn't skipping ALL classes. I was also told I was doing fine in the report card he wrote for me, I expected my grade to correlate with what he wrote there.", "To be honest I agree with the ESH people because I could've done better, however I believe most of the blame and overall sketchiness lies with my teacher. \n\nThe YTA people just seem to be basing themselves on a conspiracy that I'm either lying or secretly manipulating them.", "I agree with you. Thanks for the reply.", "That is actually an important difference you highlighted between those that failed and did not. Learning opportunities abound. If you are going to slack, some sucking up is necessary.", "Leaving class early and leaving the building are not the same thing. You said he would let you leave class early, now you are saying he let you leave the building as if he committed child endangerment. Either way, it is your responsibility. You clearly know you are not supposed to leave the building so why would you do that and then turn around and blame the teacher!? I think your post and comments are very telling as to why he failed you, i bet your attitude has a lot to do with it.", "If you believe you are going to pass after not participating in the majority of classes then you're missing some common sense, you shouldn't need to be told this or given notice.", "Op clarified that the other he feels were slacking befriended the teacher directly, thus at least having some participation. And being PE talking about extracurricular sporting activity can be crucial to slacker success. Skipping PE to play soccer may be acceptable in a lot of ways.", "You know full well how school works. You aren't in elementary school. You know you need to apply yourself. If you need a teacher to tell you what you already know you should go back to grade 3.", "You seriously need to change your attitude, again if you need grades to pass a class and most of the time you are not doing anything in that class, the teacher is supposed to invent those grades?\n\nThe teacher was wrong for not telling you anything, but you are old enough to understand that you are also wrong, the teachers are not supposed to tell you to participate in class is obvious.\n\nAlso, the fact that the teacher didn't do his job properly it doesn't mean that you are not responsible for your desicions.", "I can agree with you on that one. Sucking up is necessary with some teachers. However, I still believe I should've been warned in my report card.", "Gym class in my school takes place in a gym outside of my school. A bunch of blocks away. Leaving class and leaving the building are literally the same thing as it's just one big gym with the street outside.\n\nWhat the hell am I supossed to do if my teacher just calls off class? Stay there for half an hour, alone?", "You don't seem to understand that I was told by the teacher that I was doing fine in a report he wrote for me and my parents two weeks before he failed me.", "I agree with the fact that I should've done more and dealt with the situation differently. However, most of the blame here still lies with my teacher as he outright didn't do his job.", "Of course I'm responsible for my own actions however if the teacher tells me I'm doing good in a report card (which is supossed to reflect the grade he'll be giving me two weeks after which will define if I fail or pass) directed towards me and my parents I'll assume what I'm doing is enough.", "Keep holding that victim card. I will continue to not care about your (fake) victim status and obvious repercussions.", "Again, you are adding to the story to make yourself look better. Calling off class and not stopping you from leaving is different. So what did other students do when he called off class?? Was it him calling the class off every time? Because the way you wrote it is you were leaving and he wasnt stopping you. Still your responsibility. You can continue to add to your story and that will not change. You don\u2019t participate, you leave, you fail, very simple (you said others played sports in one comment, which is participating as it is a PE class). You are just being vindictive.", "As in he told you that you would pass or that your behaviour is classes was fine and not disruptive at all?", "I'm sorry but the blame lands fully on you. It's your education and it's your responsibility to take charge of that. There are a lot of teacher out there who doesn't care if you pass or fail and will sit there and watch you fail. Do yourself a favor and take charge of your life and education it's only in your hands.", "are you serious? do almost nothing is not enough", "Got it. However, I will still believe me or at the very least my parents are entitled to a proper report card considering my teacher is getting paid for slacking off at his own job.", "When he called off class everyone left. He called off class multiple times and allowed people to \"leave early\" multiple times saying it was no issue. I'm adding to my story because I can never give out enough CONTEXT since I'm trying to explain the events of two months. I didn't contradict myself at any point in my story and lying would be bad for me because I'm trying to make a judgement based on the facts here, and accussing me of lying isn't helping.\n\nPlus yes, others did \"participate\" by just playing any sport but the teacher still failed miserably at doing his job and endangered us by letting us go out the building early.", "Yes.

Start recording this guy.", "NTA I don\u2019t know how school works places elsewhere but even if this teacher was acting like a college professor, he shouldn\u2019t be. It\u2019s a teachers JOB to instruct, clearly outline information, and engage with students. I also had a teacher like this who was friendly and popular with kids by letting us go or play games, but he would ALWAYS directly outline that not running a lap or whatever would result in less points. I\u2019m not sure why everyone is defending OP\u2019s teacher, high school doesn\u2019t work like college at all, every teacher has to provide at least some syllabus or informative resource outlining grade percentages, attendance rules and the like. If this man did none of these things then he failed at being a teacher. I agree that in college you\u2019re responsible for yourself but this just seems like a gotcha trick by the teacher from the lack of clear communication, he could\u2019ve done better.", "NTA\n\nPE is one of those classes where expectations range widely. I've had PE classes where you were expected to do some kind of physical activity every day, and I've had PE classes where no one cared, and I got an A while sitting in the bleachers every day. It is up to the teacher to lay down the expectations for the class. If he tells students they can leave, no problem, of course they're going to take that to mean there's no penalty. \n\nHe also did not indicate you were failing on your progress report, which also would have led you to believe you were doing fine. \n\nI see a lot of commenters comparing this to college. But colleges *do* lay down expectations. The teacher won't make you work or come to class, but the syllabus will tell you how many days you're allowed to miss, the penalties for missing them, and the worth of assignments.", "YTA", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"PE was the class of the day so I usually took this time to rest and I was never told I should participate or that I was going to fail the class if I didn't participate.\" ..
