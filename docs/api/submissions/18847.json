We make decently good money HHI $300k but we haven't been in this money for that long and we did put our the vast majority of our savings for a down payment on a house.We are also in a period of time with high childcare cost. I also have low six-figure student loan debt and we each have car loans. I would like not to deal with debt our entire life.\n\nMy SIL (30) makes over $180k for a few years now. Supposedly, her partner's family has money and he is of similar age and earning potential.\n\nMy husband paid for his sister's masters program. We only spent less than 10k including everything even accommodation for our own wedding in part because he was paying her not cheap tution. She doesn't recognize how much he sacrifice to do so. It's not expected that she will pay that back and I am fine with that. Most was spent when were dating and not that much after marriage.\n\nWhen we got married we had a smallish reception in India because his parents wanted it. My SIL didn't come because she wanted to start her internship during the holiday season.(Although, we spent 1k on a non-refundable ticket for her). He co-signed and paid the down payment for a loan - when we had no money and a bay on the way without really asking. She didn't realize autopay was off a ended degrading his credit score right when we were home shopping so our mortgage rate is higher than it would've been otherwise and will be for years to come.\n\nShe is now getting married. My husband gets off the phone with his mom and says we need to sell out investments to give at least $10k for his sister's wedding. We have budget about $7k already for plane tickets to attend ( at least him and two  kids- I might go but I will be 3 months post-partum and I am not sure about bringing a newborn on a 24+ hour travel adventure---- another reason why I am the bad guy ) \n\nWell anyways,. I refused for him to give that money. I said she didn't ask and doesn't need it . She is old enough to have saved or plan something within budget that parties can afford without him contributing. Apparently, the wedding will be more than 1,100 people. He says why do I hate his family and it's tradition for him to help pay. I told him that he has obligation to his family - his kids. He says I am too money minded and selfish. I said that it is not fair to spend most of our disposable income for thr year on his sister. That his sister is a grown woman and he has already contributed enough to her life. This wedding is a want and not a need. I also pointed out that he wants to spend more money on his sister's wedding than he did even on his own.We will have three young children and our own debts. The economy is not stable and we cannot deplete our savings for his sister. Am I the asshole for refusing?\n\nEdit 1:His thoughts are that sisters wedding is now. We can take care of our stuff later and he should contribute.I grew up poor. So Iknow what it feels like for money to disappear. I know that a good job today doesn't mean a good job in the future. We are dual income and one income can cover all expenses if we stop 401k and took the kids out of daycare and it would be very tight hence why savings is important. It is of the thought that our very modest wedding was not because of preference but because we were at a different financial state. But she didn't attend our wedding at the end of the day cause she didn't feel like it was important. For me is the non-verbals and knowing his father in particular it's about appearance and this is his only daughter. The fact the partner's family has money makes him want to measure up to them. If he doesn't push back his parents will ask him for money probably without telling his sister for more and more stuff . I am under the impression that the dad is the one planning it. She is in the US too.\n\nEdit 2: Spoke to SIL . She was surprised that MIL would ask for 10k she said she already sent the money for the venue. She told her not to ask him because he has other things going on with his life and she has been saving. So basically this his feelings of what he SHOULD do but it's customary.  She asked if both of the kids would need plane tickets and said that the tickets are already expensive.", "created_utc": 1685776437, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13z4dxl/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_husband_contribute/", "score": 622, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

With all the details you provided, it's clear that you husband has already done a lot for his sister (and sometimes that forced you to make sacrifices too - like having a cheap wedding, paying a higher mortgage, delaying payment of your own loans). Selling investments to add money to what is probably an already big pot for her wedding, all while having 2 kids and another on the way, is not wise at all. You are right to point out that the family he made with you should take priority over the family he was born into. \n\nI won't jump to \"divorce\" like it seems to be a trend on Reddit, because the flags aren't that red. Your husband is used to being the provider for his younger sister and there's probably a cultural expectation that he take this role. I think this is something that can be solved with communication. Make it clear that you absolutely do not hate his family, and that it's simply a matter of prioritizing your children's future (comfort, education, health) over adding more luxury to what will probably be a fancy wedding anyway.", "NTA.

I believe that in that case, no one is \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d, but that you need to communicate better and reach an agreement that you can both live with.

Understandably there\u2019s probably a lot of cultural expectations about taking care of family, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re able to see that boundaries need to be put in place but I don\u2019t think your husband is there yet, and he needs to be. That means he also has to be ok with the tension and conflict this will cause between him and his family. It\u2019s unfortunate but that\u2019s the reality, I hope you don\u2019t become the bad guy in this situation but I think this is one of those times where it has to be the two of you, as a unit, supporting each other, standing up for your family. That\u2019s what marriage should be (in my limited knowledge as a single person). If you go to the wedding, go hand in hand with your head held high. Best of luck OP!", "Instinctively, NTA, but I'm naive to the traditions of your culture. Is he being fair when he says this is an expectation from tradition. If so then I guess you have to ask yourself if you also have expectations of others via the traditions of your culture.", "[deleted]", "I was fully prepared to say let him contribute to his little sister's wedding until I read the part where her masters was paid for, she makes plenty of money now, and is marrying into a family with plenty of money, and is having an extravagant wedding. NTA. Does his sister know about this request? Maybe it's his parents that are hurting for money with this.", "I feel I might be missing something cultural here, but looking at it from my cultural perspective, I don't see why a brother had to pay for his sister's wedding, considering she works and is able to support herself.

That money is for their grandchildren, not an adult who has a job.", "NTA he\u2019s already been overly generous with her and she makes more then enough money to afford it herself", "I don't think sil is the problem... it is that your husband has a vision of his role in his birth family.. He maybe feels he will be somehow less in his own eyes if he is not contributing.", "That's my thought, I said she's not 20 anymore with no income of her own. She is grown and working . Her future husband is grown and working. What's next we should finance a down payment for a house in his parents opinion ? \n\nFor graduate school, she would not have been able to attend if he did not pay. That education had allowed her to have the job now and a better life in the states. She was also in her early/ mid 20s then and wouldn't be able to \"blessed\" with students loans because she was a foreign student.", "Godzilla", "His sister has not asked for the money. His parents have. I am hoping she reigns in their expectations. I am not sure if they are even having a honeymoon. They should but I think a lot of PTO will be used up for the wedding stuff.", "Totally agree! And with their own debt with student loans, mortgage and two car loans, they would be selling their investments which is for THE FAMILY to give to his sister. No one asked him to and he may feel obligated for whatever reason but paying her tuition was more than enough. \n\nIt sounds like he's been a huge financier of her life that she takes him for granted and might even take advantage. He needs to choose his priority and I hope it's OP and their three kids. No one should risk the financial stability of their family for something like this, especially when she clearly makes enough. Her salary is more than half of their combined income; she can pay for her own wedding with her well off fiance.", "I grew up without much and we both had basically nothing when we started dating. I had less than nothing  because of student loans. He's not great about talking about stuff he's just avoid. I understand that weddings are to inflated egos in India to demonstrate wealth. What it boils down to is I don't see his sister as the same level of priority as our kids. I don't see this wedding of 1,100 as a need but a want. If his parents got sick and needed 10-20k no problem ---thats a need . I will figure that out but a wedding ...nope.", "No...I am American.", "South asian female here so I can relate to this topic and how you\u2019re feeling. Hate to say it but your SIL is NOT the problem. Your husband is the problem because he don\u2019t see things the same way as you. He has 2 kids and a baby on the way! He wants to leave you and his newborn baby 3 months after you have given birth to attend his sister\u2019s wedding in India?? \n\nThe same sister who didn\u2019t give a F*** about his wedding and his wife? Did she even give you two a wedding gift or congratulated you despite her not showing up for your wedding? Your husband needs to grow a spine and get his priorities in check. In Indian culture it\u2019s a pretty big deal if the groom\u2019s sibling/siblings don\u2019t attend his wedding for no reason at all. His sister simply don\u2019t care about him and his little family so why is he going out of his way to satisfy and comply to all her demands ? \n\nDoesn\u2019t matter how old his sister is and how much she earns. Your mil and sil will always see your husband as a cash cow despite him not having much money in his savings account. He needs to realize this is a BIG problem that will never go away or disappear unless he opens his mouth and say no! He needs to think about and prioritize his own little family BEFORE his parents and siblings who are all adults with jobs. Kids are expensive nowadays and so are childbirths (if you live in US). He needs to start saving up for his childrens college funds amongst other things. Do not let him give 10K to a selfish entitled person who didn\u2019t even show up to his wedding.", "I\u2019m 100% with you on this one. It\u2019s great that your husband wants to be a kind brother and help his sister out, but I\u2019m firmly of the belief that if you can\u2019t afford to get married, either lower your plans or wait and save up until you can. Sounds like she can afford it herself, so literally no need for your savings to take a hit.", "Tbh, this is going to sound very AHish, but I'm worried about your spineless husband attending the wedding on his own. Your MIL and possibly SIL and other relatives are going to spend this time happily poisoning his mind further about his duties to the family, how much of an AH you are, etc etc etc.", "Right. But he sees it differently - if he doesn\u2019t send the money, then he\u2019s announcing to his extended family and all of their friends that he doesn\u2019t really care about his family, doesn\u2019t care if his sister lives or dies. \n\nI think reducing it to \u201cinflated Indian egos\u201d is missing the psychological reality for your life partner. If you want to stay together, and you\u2019ve not indicated otherwise, I think this be well-served by investing in understanding more in how he sees stuff like this, if only so that your communication will be improved and your expectations will be better aligned the next time (spoiler: there will be a next time).", "I know it's more complicated. For him sending money= devotion to his mother. Honestly, at this point his sister hasn't asked for anything since she has been able to fend for herself. The only time he really disappointed her was when he decided to marry me. She had never meet or spoke to me but I was not the correct person.\n\nMe not going to the wedding was another issue. But I made it clear that under no circumstance am I taking a newborn under 6 months on a plane to the other side of the world.  They were thinking that a 2 or 3 month old could attend such event. When I point out that his sister did not attend our Indian stuff he points out that she did attend the US one. I do so only to underscore that its not that important. \n\nI am at the point of saying you have $8k to spend on the wedding but that includes your travel ( and any of the kids travel). Also the wedding is Jan 4th which means he will not be here for New Years and maybe miss Christmas too.", "Shouldn't her husband do the same - invest in understanding more in how OP sees stuff like this?\n\nI agree with your previous comment about considering counselling.", "Ask him if he plans on choosing one of your children to pamper and pay for, and another to work hard and provide for their siblings forever. Tell him you'd appreciate a heads-up about who the victim is going to be in the next generation, because you sure married the one in yours.", "I think the wedding is less of an issue than the communication problems. I think your reasons for not going are fine, your reasons for not sending money are strong, and his reasons for wanting to send money are at least a little sympathetic. I think the issue is the intense frustration you must both be feeling about your spouses, and the fact that that\u2019ll just make everything harder.", "This. Ask which of his kids he has chosen for each role. Make him think it through.", "Tell me your husband is Indian, without telling me he is Indian.\nNTA. But this is a typical Indian son playbook. You need to dig down and dig deep. Pretty soon it will be either subsidize his retired parents or bring them to live with you.", "ESH\n\nHe's a bit of an AH for arbitrarily deciding on $10k as a number without having a really in-depth discussion with you about what you (as a family) can afford to contribute to his sister's wedding. You're right that it's not a negligible amount, and it's something that requires thoughtful conversation.\n\nBUT . . . I'm sorry to say, you are the far bigger AH here, and this is why:\n\n>He says why do I hate his family and it's tradition for him to help pay. I told him that he has obligation to his family - his kids. . . . That his sister is a grown woman and he has already contributed enough to her life. This wedding is a want and not a need.\n\nI'm assuming that you're white, and American (possibly Canadian, though that seems less likely, from my experience as a Canadian and our general attitudes regarding multiculturalism). You're making this about the numbers, and wants vs needs, because in your mind that's all it is. But that just speaks to the fact that you either have no fundamental understanding of your husband's ethnocultural traditions, or you have no respect for them. Either way, you're an AH. Because it's not about the money, it's about his wanting to take care of family. And contrary to what you've been taught in a very individualistic country, \"family\" doesn't always just mean the kids you made yourself. You're an AH for being shockingly dismissive of things that are deeply important to him, that he was raised with and clearly holds dear to his heart. It doesn't mean that you have to let him spend $10k, but you need to HEAR what he's telling you, and have a good faith conversation about it, not just suggest that it's about greed or \"wants\". It isn't.", "NTA. This is crazy. You have six figures of debt and can't afford it. Sounds like sister and family need to be told how much she has screwed you by messing up your credit. Sounds like you and your husband need counseling or financial counseling.\n\nI don't understand why someone who is broke has to pay for someone more well off. Do his family understand how broke you guys are?", "NTA \n\nBut you need marriage counseling. He is unreasonable and this is absolutely going to end badly.", "INFO: Does your sister have education funds set aside for your kids to help pay your husband's generosity forward? Did she get you a wedding gift after flaking? Did she apologize for her credit usage's impact on your mortgage?\n\nI suspect that she doesn't give AF about your family and your husband needs to answer some very serious questions about where his priorities lie and why.", "Nta. And this really doesn't stop. My dad is in his mid 60s and was still expected to pay his sisters (absolutely randomly for no reason) over and above the fact that he pretty much paid all their wedding expenses, has helped pay their children's wedding expenses, their hospital bills a lot of the times, etc etc. \n\nWell it's only in the last few years that he has finally put his foot down and put a stop to it.", "NTA.", "ESH -  before you married your husband you saw how he prioritizes his family, specifically his sister, so why would you think that would change? this is a husband issue", "This isn't about helping. it's about being seen to be helping.

See if he has a reasonable explanation - he needs to write it down and read it.", "I\u2019m not even sure this is driven by an urge to be kind to his sister. This sounds like a severe case of \u201cwhat will people say?\u201d", "This is not about being kind. It is about being seen to be kind. He knows she doesn't need the money. He just wants to be seen to be giving it.", "I think he's a typical Indian son and brother raised to take care of his sibs. But he's definitely more self sacrificing than any guy I know! His own wedding was simple whereas his sister's is going to be a lot grander because as per South Asian tradition, the bride's parents pay for the wedding and the multiple pre and post events. Given how sis treated him by not turning up for his wedding, ( a big no no in India where family is very close), OP's hb would be well within his rights not to attend and not to finance this entitled sister's wedding.", "It should be obvious to you by now that the OP as well as the majority of people here don\u2018t want to hear reason. It\u2018s easier to just advise to\u201edivorce his ass\u201c.\n\nEvery successfully married couple will tell you that marriage is a non-ending compromise and communication is key.", "Sister needs to cut back on some expenses instead of demanding money from your family's coffers.

It's easy to say someone is money minded when they're the one giving your money away.", "NTA But if you refuse to allow him to contribute he may resent you for it. This is obviously something he feels obligated to do and it sounds like his family could shame him for years to come if he doesn't. He is in a horrible position of choosing who to make happy - you or his family. \n\nGiving him an ultimatum may let you win this battle but lose the war for keeping a happy marriage. I would urge you to work out a compromise on this. \n\nAll of the Western people are agreeing with you because that's what would be right for our culture. You have to look at how this will impact your marriage and relationship with his family based on your relationship, family, and cultural dynamics.", "NTA.  He\u2019s given her a lot over the years and she makes good money too, so she shouldn\u2019t need it from you.

OP is kind of the A-H to her own kids/family for not addressing this sooner.  Her husband paid for his sister's tuition but didn't pay off his own wife's tuition loan!", "NTA but I\u2019d probably separate my finances from him. Each contribute a % of their income based on how much they earn to cover all shared household costs to a joint account. Everything else separated. This way you can pay down your debt and save and he is actually only spending his $ perhaps then he will feel differently.", "NTA. Tell your husband that you\u2019ll divorce him before you", "Every conflict on here is about divorce. Take a chill pill. If everyone took the advice of women on this sub the divorce rate would skyrocket more than it already has.", "You\u2019re not the AH here but as others have said the issue here is not the 10k, but your husband. There is a cultural aspect here that should have been discussed long ago (frankly before marriage and kids) that you two need us seriously sit down and discuss. You can blame his sister and your in laws all you want but at the end of the day the issue here is your husband.", "Imo though, life is too short for bad relationships.", "This is exactly it. His sister has not asked. I have previously mentioned to it to his sister. Right after, she finished her schoolin. His mom asked him to save $500 per month for his sister's wedding - I said she's not even dating and we will cross the bridge later. Two years ago when she was looking for someone I told her about what her mom said don't worry about it I have been saving. \n\nI didn't appreciate a side comment that his mom apparently made. Why are you in America if you have no money? It feels like even telling me that is disrespectful. And additionally, it's not like we have absolutely no assets - we have been funding our 401ks , monthly contributions to 529 accounts, and we  paid 20% down on our home (which is a nice house), and he has a nice car. It's a new car and almost 3x mine. We did not need the car but he wanted it for years now and I could make the monthly work. I manage the finances.I don't splurge on non-essentials and I work as well.\n\nHe needs to put family of his kids above his image in India. There is stuff going on a each job where we could be laid-off this year. I really don't want him committing money now. He can do what he wants with $8k budgeted for travel . The kids can stay in the states and he can attend by himself and give $5k to his sister. If I don't stop it now we would be out probably $30k by the end of it.\n\nHis thoughts are that sisters wedding is now. We can take care of our stuff later and he should contribute. I grew up poor. I know what it feels like for money to disappear. I know that a good job today doesn't mean a good job in the future. We are dual income and one income can cover all expenses if we stop 401k and took the kids out of daycare and it would be very tight hence why savings is important. It is of the thought that our very modest wedding was not because of preference but because we were at a different financial state. But she didn't attend our wedding at the end of the day cause she didn't feel like it was important. For me is the non-verbals and knowing his father in particular it's about appearance and this is his only daughter. The fact the partner's family has money makes him want to measure up to them. If he doesn't push back his parents will ask him for money probably without telling his sister for more and more stuff . I am under the impression that the dad is the one planning it. She is in the US too.", "This is such a similar vibe to what recently happened at my bf\u2019s (young) aunt\u2019s wedding. The husband is a super nice guy but he comes from a SEA family. So many things were compromised on in the wedding for his family\u2019s comfort. But the whole family rocks up to the wedding and we find out we were pretty much the only ones not invited to the ceremony and it was just a reception for us. I was so pissed I missed out on Mother\u2019s Day for that bullshit. \n\nThe music was SO loud (Also the women weren\u2019t allowed to dance, but also anyone who wasn\u2019t part of his family) that my watch kept buzzing and saying that it was bad enough for hearing loss. I spent quite a bit outside for \u2018smoke breaks\u2019 and bringing his little sister with me. I got pretty baked so I could not be super pissed, but everyone was not acknowledging it, besides saying \u201cthat\u2019s their culture\u201d. His sister was just as pissed but felt like she had to bury it, so I\u2019m glad I got her to open up about it. The only part of the wedding that was even celebrating the bride, for the couple it was the only dance that actually happened together, was the speech from her maid of honor and a speech from her close in age brother (the parents and him were the only 3 from her side to see the ceremony.\n\nSo many more things pissed me off but I\u2019m telling you, how he treats you and yours now when these big events come up are how he will treat you in the end.", "Yes.

If they spend $10k of that on someone else's wedding, you think the first thing they'll cut from their budget is food for their children?", "Lol I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t just threaten divorce like you do timeout with a child", "In marriage, unless you want to make divorce a reality you never mention it as a threat or frankly, even as a joke. She does need to sit down with him with the facts of how much his actions are harming their relationship and their future goals and plans.

I'd be hesitant to go great distances during that time and would want my husband close enough to get to us quickly.\n\nAlso these days schools no longer supply equipment for after school sports.

Football helmet and as the child grows you'll need to buy new ones, snowboard, tennis racket, travel if any, etc. It adds up especially with four children. \n\nWith a number of children you might need to hire after school care to get everyone where they need to be since they won't ask be in the same field or town and pay someone to help on the weekends too. \n\nPrices for everything are going up and will continue.

MC parents profession, the kids profession etc. The couple is not an arrange marriage but not a love marriage either . It was we have never dated but know each other and we are getting \"old\" how about we get married. With that being said ,I think they may be a decent match as they belonged to the same friend group and I think he liked her for sometime.But, right now they don't even live in the same state right now.
