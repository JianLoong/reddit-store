Supposedly, her partner's family has money and he is of similar age and earning potential.\n\nMy husband paid for his sister's masters program. We only spent less than 10k including everything even accommodation for our own wedding in part because he was paying her not cheap tution. She doesn't recognize how much he sacrifice to do so. It's not expected that she will pay that back and I am fine with that. Most was spent when were dating and not that much after marriage.\n\nWhen we got married we had a smallish reception in India because his parents wanted it. My SIL didn't come because she wanted to start her internship during the holiday season.(Although, we spent 1k on a non-refundable ticket for her). He co-signed and paid the down payment for a loan - when we had no money and a bay on the way without really asking. She didn't realize autopay was off a ended degrading his credit score right when we were home shopping so our mortgage rate is higher than it would've been otherwise and will be for years to come.\n\nShe is now getting married. My husband gets off the phone with his mom and says we need to sell out investments to give at least $10k for his sister's wedding. We have budget about $7k already for plane tickets to attend ( at least him and two  kids- I might go but I will be 3 months post-partum and I am not sure about bringing a newborn on a 24+ hour travel adventure---- another reason why I am the bad guy ) \n\nWell anyways,. I refused for him to give that money. I said she didn't ask and doesn't need it . She is old enough to have saved or plan something within budget that parties can afford without him contributing. Apparently, the wedding will be more than 1,100 people. He says why do I hate his family and it's tradition for him to help pay. I told him that he has obligation to his family - his kids. He says I am too money minded and selfish. I said that it is not fair to spend most of our disposable income for thr year on his sister. That his sister is a grown woman and he has already contributed enough to her life. This wedding is a want and not a need. I also pointed out that he wants to spend more money on his sister's wedding than he did even on his own.We will have three young children and our own debts.

Absolutely no reason at all why you should finance his sister\u2019s wedding - ESPECIALLY as much as that. I would have said no too.", "NTA. Tell your husband that you\u2019ll divorce him before you allow a third person to get involved and dictate where he spends your joint savings. His sister makes more than enough money to pay for her own wedding. Call your MIL and tell her to take out a loan because you will not be taking bread out of your children\u2019s mouths nor money out of their college funds for a party.", "NTA.  What's probably going on here is sister wants your hubby to chip in $10K for the wedding so that the newlyweds can afford a nicER honeymoon....", "NTA, get a new husband", "NTA, entirely. She is his sister, not his dependent. Honestly, 1100 people at a wedding? I understand it might be cultural thing, but it is a bit insane scale. I wouldn't bring a newborn baby in this madness.", "NTA.\n\nHis paying for her master\u2019s is more than enough charity. Now she makes more than enough to cover her own wedding.", "NTA and the big difference between your weddings smells of parents playing favorites. Same for your ILs judging you for not forcing a newborn on a 24hours trip. Your hb seems to be trying every reason to justify the simple fact he doesn't know how to say no to his parents", "NTA. With all the details you provided, it's clear that you husband has already done a lot for his sister (and sometimes that forced you to make sacrifices too - like having a cheap wedding, paying a higher mortgage, delaying payment of your own loans). Selling investments to add money to what is probably an already big pot for her wedding, all while having 2 kids and another on the way, is not wise at all. You are right to point out that the family he made with you should take priority over the family he was born into. \n\nI won't jump to \"divorce\" like it seems to be a trend on Reddit, because the flags aren't that red. Your husband is used to being the provider for his younger sister and there's probably a cultural expectation that he take this role. I think this is something that can be solved with communication. Make it clear that you absolutely do not hate his family, and that it's simply a matter of prioritizing your children's future (comfort, education, health) over adding more luxury to what will probably be a fancy wedding anyway.", "NTA. You could suggest a fraction of that amount like 1K or less if you want and suggest couples Counseling where y'all discuss making financial decisions.", "NTA\n\nI know Indian weddings are expensive, but why does he need to contribute $3k more that he spent for his own wedding? Especially when SIL & fianc\u00e9 both earn six-figure income. SIL is 30. She\u2019s an adult with her own income & can pay for her own wedding. OP\u2019s husband has done a lot for his sister already. Time to prioritize his wife & own children.", "This sounds like a different expectations thing. Any chance cultural differences, or some other factor that might cause each of you to think your sense of obligation is obviously correct, and your partner\u2019s is problematic, might be at play?\n\nWhile my instinct sides with you, I\u2019m American, and as someone who was married to an Indian for many years, I can say that many differences of opinion in that marriage came down to different cultural norms. I believe that in that case, no one is \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d, but that you need to communicate better and reach an agreement that you can both live with. Until he understands why you believe what you believe, and you understand his position, you\u2019ll keep running into these stressful points of misalignment. \n\nIt might be worth considering couples counseling - that can really help with communication issues. \n\nNAH", "ESH.\n\nThis sounds like a shitty marriage.

Understandably there\u2019s probably a lot of cultural expectations about taking care of family, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re able to see that boundaries need to be put in place but I don\u2019t think your husband is there yet, and he needs to be. That means he also has to be ok with the tension and conflict this will cause between him and his family. It\u2019s unfortunate but that\u2019s the reality, I hope you don\u2019t become the bad guy in this situation but I think this is one of those times where it has to be the two of you, as a unit, supporting each other, standing up for your family. That\u2019s what marriage should be (in my limited knowledge as a single person). If you go to the wedding, go hand in hand with your head held high. Best of luck OP!", "Instinctively, NTA, but I'm naive to the traditions of your culture. Is he being fair when he says this is an expectation from tradition. If so then I guess you have to ask yourself if you also have expectations of others via the traditions of your culture.", "[deleted]", "I was fully prepared to say let him contribute to his little sister's wedding until I read the part where her masters was paid for, she makes plenty of money now, and is marrying into a family with plenty of money, and is having an extravagant wedding. NTA. Does his sister know about this request? Maybe it's his parents that are hurting for money with this.", "I feel I might be missing something cultural here, but looking at it from my cultural perspective, I don't see why a brother had to pay for his sister's wedding, considering she works and is able to support herself.  NTA", "NTA. His parents should understand that his priority is your kids. That money is for their grandchildren, not an adult who has a job.", "NTA he\u2019s already been overly generous with her and she makes more then enough money to afford it herself", "I don't think sil is the problem... it is that your husband has a vision of his role in his birth family.. He maybe feels he will be somehow less in his own eyes if he is not contributing.", "That's my thought, I said she's not 20 anymore with no income of her own. She is grown and working . Her future husband is grown and working. What's next we should finance a down payment for a house in his parents opinion ? \n\nFor graduate school, she would not have been able to attend if he did not pay. That education had allowed her to have the job now and a better life in the states. She was also in her early/ mid 20s then and wouldn't be able to \"blessed\" with students loans because she was a foreign student.", "Godzilla", "His sister has not asked for the money. His parents have. I am hoping she reigns in their expectations. I am not sure if they are even having a honeymoon. They should but I think a lot of PTO will be used up for the wedding stuff.", "Totally agree! And with their own debt with student loans, mortgage and two car loans, they would be selling their investments which is for THE FAMILY to give to his sister. No one asked him to and he may feel obligated for whatever reason but paying her tuition was more than enough. \n\nIt sounds like he's been a huge financier of her life that she takes him for granted and might even take advantage. He needs to choose his priority and I hope it's OP and their three kids. No one should risk the financial stability of their family for something like this, especially when she clearly makes enough. Her salary is more than half of their combined income; she can pay for her own wedding with her well off fiance.", "I grew up without much and we both had basically nothing when we started dating. I had less than nothing  because of student loans. He's not great about talking about stuff he's just avoid. I understand that weddings are to inflated egos in India to demonstrate wealth. What it boils down to is I don't see his sister as the same level of priority as our kids. I don't see this wedding of 1,100 as a need but a want. If his parents got sick and needed 10-20k no problem ---thats a need . I will figure that out but a wedding ...nope.", "No...I am American.", "South asian female here so I can relate to this topic and how you\u2019re feeling. Hate to say it but your SIL is NOT the problem. Your husband is the problem because he don\u2019t see things the same way as you. He has 2 kids and a baby on the way! He wants to leave you and his newborn baby 3 months after you have given birth to attend his sister\u2019s wedding in India?? \n\nThe same sister who didn\u2019t give a F*** about his wedding and his wife? Did she even give you two a wedding gift or congratulated you despite her not showing up for your wedding? Your husband needs to grow a spine and get his priorities in check. In Indian culture it\u2019s a pretty big deal if the groom\u2019s sibling/siblings don\u2019t attend his wedding for no reason at all. His sister simply don\u2019t care about him and his little family so why is he going out of his way to satisfy and comply to all her demands ? \n\nDoesn\u2019t matter how old his sister is and how much she earns. Your mil and sil will always see your husband as a cash cow despite him not having much money in his savings account. He needs to realize this is a BIG problem that will never go away or disappear unless he opens his mouth and say no! He needs to think about and prioritize his own little family BEFORE his parents and siblings who are all adults with jobs. Kids are expensive nowadays and so are childbirths (if you live in US). He needs to start saving up for his childrens college funds amongst other things. Do not let him give 10K to a selfish entitled person who didn\u2019t even show up to his wedding.", "I\u2019m 100% with you on this one. It\u2019s great that your husband wants to be a kind brother and help his sister out, but I\u2019m firmly of the belief that if you can\u2019t afford to get married, either lower your plans or wait and save up until you can. Sounds like she can afford it herself, so literally no need for your savings to take a hit.", "Tbh, this is going to sound very AHish, but I'm worried about your spineless husband attending the wedding on his own. Your MIL and possibly SIL and other relatives are going to spend this time happily poisoning his mind further about his duties to the family, how much of an AH you are, etc etc etc.", "Right. But he sees it differently - if he doesn\u2019t send the money, then he\u2019s announcing to his extended family and all of their friends that he doesn\u2019t really care about his family, doesn\u2019t care if his sister lives or dies. \n\nI think reducing it to \u201cinflated Indian egos\u201d is missing the psychological reality for your life partner. If you want to stay together, and you\u2019ve not indicated otherwise, I think this be well-served by investing in understanding more in how he sees stuff like this, if only so that your communication will be improved and your expectations will be better aligned the next time (spoiler: there will be a next time).", "I know it's more complicated. For him sending money= devotion to his mother. Honestly, at this point his sister hasn't asked for anything since she has been able to fend for herself. The only time he really disappointed her was when he decided to marry me. She had never meet or spoke to me but I was not the correct person.\n\nMe not going to the wedding was another issue. But I made it clear that under no circumstance am I taking a newborn under 6 months on a plane to the other side of the world.  They were thinking that a 2 or 3 month old could attend such event. When I point out that his sister did not attend our Indian stuff he points out that she did attend the US one. I do so only to underscore that its not that important. \n\nI am at the point of saying you have $8k to spend on the wedding but that includes your travel ( and any of the kids travel). Also the wedding is Jan 4th which means he will not be here for New Years and maybe miss Christmas too.", "Shouldn't her husband do the same - invest in understanding more in how OP sees stuff like this?\n\nI agree with your previous comment about considering counselling.", "Ask him if he plans on choosing one of your children to pamper and pay for, and another to work hard and provide for their siblings forever. Tell him you'd appreciate a heads-up about who the victim is going to be in the next generation, because you sure married the one in yours.", "I think the wedding is less of an issue than the communication problems. I think your reasons for not going are fine, your reasons for not sending money are strong, and his reasons for wanting to send money are at least a little sympathetic. I think the issue is the intense frustration you must both be feeling about your spouses, and the fact that that\u2019ll just make everything harder.", "This. Ask which of his kids he has chosen for each role. Make him think it through."]}
