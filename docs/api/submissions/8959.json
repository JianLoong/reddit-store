If you're living with someone, trying to divide up who made this mess, who used what dish, etc and cleaning only your stuff, while insisting your partner cleans theirs is not healthy. To specifically call out one type of item you will NOT clean is also BS unless it's something especially onerous. I'm talking like someone did a big project and left a ton of shit out, then yeah, the person that did that should clean it up.

I'm glad you didn't escalate and this would've been an escalation, but the reality is you could've easily retorted that you do less chores because you contribute more financially, and thus if he wants you to do more around the house, he needs to contribute more to the finances so it's a more even split. \n\nAgain, that would've been an unnecessary (and petty) escalation.

It's a request in a passive aggressive tone that shows underlying issues. Maybe he is frustrated about his financial/work situation, the fact that you earn more.

At least, she thought so. She quotes him as saying, \"So, yeah, you can clean those up.\"\n\nIt sounds rude. She says he even admits that. Maybe she feels he's ordering her rather than asking her.", "NTA\n\nWhether or not someone SHOULD clean up someone's stinky lunch dishes is open for debate, but the second he said \"I do way more than you around the house, so yeah, you can clean those up\" he became the AH.\n\nMaybe he feels he does more around the house. If that's the case, he should have a discussion with you about the division of labor - NOT rudely demand that you clean his festering lunch dishes. \n\nIn any case, this conversation warrants a deeper discussion about the division of labor in your home. While you are at it, you may want to reconsider how finances are divided. It's certainly up to you if you wish to take on a greater responsibility for household bills due to your higher income, but in my experience this sort of division usually ends poorly for the higher earner unless the couple is married and building a life together.", "YTA. Who leaves dirty dishes in the sink when they are literally washing the dishes? And you know what? You better get used to it because in marriages and relationships, there are a lot more dishes to come, and somebody has got to do them. After 25 years in marriage, I can readily say that I have learned to stop looking at some things as chores or as being aggravating. Some things are maintenance issues and that's all there is to it. There's litter to be cleaned, there's toilets to be washed, laundry to be done. There are all kinds of things to be done around the house. Maybe ask yourself, what work around the house does he do for you that you aren't recognizing and that you are taking for granted?", "OP mentions his tone had bite, but I think there might be an intentional ommission that OP had a tone when they responded to his request that they clean the lunch containers too. Also, the comment that they make more  is odd. It shouldn't matter who makes more, why mention it?\n\nIt's lazy and petty. If you're doing the dishes, do all the dishes. OP is a YTA in this.", "You think I have time to heat my food, eat, and do dishes in 30 minutes?

I would give them a thorough hot water rinse and wash them (dishwasher) when I got home.", "Yeah, a lot of places don't have an extra sink for stuff like that, or won't allow personal dishes in the kitchen sink, and some people don't like rinsing stuff in bathroom sinks.", "I bring them home because the sponge in our break room smells like ass.", "Lol.", "I never trust a work kitchen sponge.

This doesn\u2019t make sense to me. What\u2019s the distinction? Kitchen ware is kitchen ware. You put that cup up to your face everyday.

You do realize that a whole lot of construction is small jobs with no trailers? How do you wash lunch dishes when all you have onsite is a portable toilet with hand sanitizer?", "No garbage disposal or food trap in a bathroom sink - it's both unsanitary to clean food into a bathroom sink and can clog it.", "Basically what the other commenter said - it's not about how it's unsanitary - it's about how that would likely clog the pedestal sink because it's not designed for food waste \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Just pointing out my work experience isn\u2019t that limited and sheltered.

You didn\u2019t dispute his statement that he does \u201cway more around the house\u201d and he had just cooked dinner and cleaned. Even if he made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for dinner, that would have taken more time than washing a few plastic containers. You need to apologize ASAP.
