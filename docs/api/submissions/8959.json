Neither sounds like a reason to have a fight. Sounds like you should discuss your chores a bit more.", "ESH. He sucks for the rude way he asked. At the same time, an \u201cI cook you do the dishes\u201d arrangement is completely fair, and if you\u2019re washing up anyway, refusing to wash up the lunch containers is just kind of petty. I agree with him that doing the washing up means you wash whatever dishes have to be washed, even if you didn\u2019t use that particular dish.", "NTA.  Apparently he is holding some resentment, because if he was just asking you to clean the containers, when you asked for clarity he would have just said yes, rather than laying out reasons why you should have to do it.

They're dishes, and you're doing the dishes.\n\nBut also he could have asked nicely and without a bite to his tone.", "I\u2019m going with YTA. I would have said E S H but you said he understands his tone was rude but his request was fair which I agree with. If you\u2019re washing the dishes, you wash all the dishes.

I don\u2019t personally see why just because it\u2019s a work container, he had to wash it. Also, I\u2019ve read that sometimes \u201cfairness\u201d in splitting housework is if one person cooks the meal, the other washes the dishes. It wasn\u2019t going to hurt you to wash them, but I understand being annoyed at his tone.   \nI think this is a communication issue.", "NTA, but your boyfriend is if he itemizes everything.", "YTA.  You were already doing the dishes.  The request was fair.  I can understand being irritated when he just cooked and cleaned.  The least you could do is wash a few extra containers.", "NTA, it's fine to ask, it's not okay to demand. He demanded you do it because of x, y, z wich makes it assholish", "NTA because of how he talked to you, otherwise if he'd not been an ahole it would've been n a h\n\nYou need to have a conversation because he's indicating that chores in the household aren't equal, which means you two need to get on the same page.\n\nAlso.. containers... multiple? That's gross. He should be at least rinsing with soap and water at work, and cleaning them when he gets home.", "ESH. His response was rude. But he is right that if you're doing the dishes, it's really pet to parse out his dishes and refuse to wash them because they aren't yours.", "Hm, is this a longer standing issue than you're making it out to be? Are you intentionally cleaning everything except the lunch containers and leaving those in the sink night after night? If so, that's very passive aggressive. When he cleans up, does he just do everything in the sink regardless of who used it?\n\nAnyway, my preliminary $0.02:\n\nYTA. If you're living with someone, trying to divide up who made this mess, who used what dish, etc and cleaning only your stuff, while insisting your partner cleans theirs is not healthy. To specifically call out one type of item you will NOT clean is also BS unless it's something especially onerous. I'm talking like someone did a big project and left a ton of shit out, then yeah, the person that did that should clean it up. But if its just ordinary day-to-day stuff.... if you have a rotation of cleaning, just do it all, don't do everything except this one thing. That's petty BS.", "\"Last night, I was washing up after dinner and finished the dishes that we used.

If you share choirs, and your turn is to do dishes, wash them all not behave offended because you have to wash dishes your partner used to eat, that's just ridiculous behavior. And you paying more has something with this situation how? We often judge men how they think they should do less because they have bigger income, is it because you give more $$ mean you shouldn't wash dishes he used!? That's is AH behavior.", "ESH. He didn't need to be nasty or act entitled to you finishing the dishes, but when you're living together and sharing household responsibilities it doesn't make sense to me that you'd stop washing dishes when you get to his.\n\nIt sounds like both of you are a bit too focused on keeping score, and clearly there's more to the story than the tupperware. Maybe he's resentful of you making more or having less debt, or he feels the housework isn't being shared equitably. This is worth a longer conversation.", "NTA pointing with a tone like it\u2019s your job and he\u2019s your boss ? Noooo.", "NTA - because they way you describe him asking you sounds rude and demanding. If he has a complaint about the way chores are divided that's not the eay to bring it up. I tend to agree with him though that whomever does dishes should just do all the dishes, but it aeems like y'all ned to have a conversation about how chores work between you? It sounds like he's resentful and not good at finding solutions", "ESH. He didn't need to cop an attitude about it, but I find it weird to be doing the washing and not do everything.", "Yta", "Well, it looks like somebody needs to go out and buy disposable \u201ccontainers\u201d for his lunch, and that somebody isn\u2019t *you*. \n\nHe could have asked nicely.

And you probably would've said yes. It would've been completely uneventful. \n\nInstead, he used an imperative tone and not-so-subtly demanded you wash his containers, you responded negatively and borderline passive aggressive to indicate you didn't think his containers were your responsibility, and he proceeded to try a petty \"I do more than you so you owe me\" argument. \n\nWhich besides petty, it also doesn't hold. I'm glad you didn't escalate and this would've been an escalation, but the reality is you could've easily retorted that you do less chores because you contribute more financially, and thus if he wants you to do more around the house, he needs to contribute more to the finances so it's a more even split. \n\nAgain, that would've been an unnecessary (and petty) escalation. But his logic is flawed. What he wanted was a small favor. He acted as if it was his right.", "NTA, but the tone and what he said suggests an underlying issue. It sounds like you two should have a discussion about division of chores again. I don't know why people are saying to have a discussion about finance though. As someone who lives with a SO and makes significantly more money than them I'd never use \"oh I pay more money so I have to do less work\" unless they stopped working 40 hours a week.", "NTA.  It's a request in a passive aggressive tone that shows underlying issues. Maybe he is frustrated about his financial/work situation, the fact that you earn more. It is also possible that he thinks paying a bigger part of the living costs doesn't equate doing chores, so no matter who pays what, the chores should be equally shared.\n\nWhatever the reason, it was the wrong way to start a discussion and he should apologise.", "NTA.\n\nAsking your SO to wash those container for you is perfectly fine.

What happened to his last slave?", ">I cooked and cleaned tonight, and do way more than you around the house, so yeah, you can clean those up.\n\nIf he's unhappy about doing chores in the house, he should be contributing 50% of the expenses. \n\n>I contribute more $$ to our living expenses\n\nHe wants everything equal, it starts with the money. \n\nNTA.", "NTA - Next time just throw them away!", "NTA - HIs tone and assumptions are the problem here, not your willingness or unwillingness to clean his lunch containers.

It gets really annoying when a live-in partner *will not* help out their partner if said help does not/did not benefit them in some way. Ie, you would only clean the dishes that were made from him cooking dinner for you, but not his lunch containers that were only used by *him* and for *him*.\n\nC\u2019mon, OP. It\u2019s called a partnership for a reason. You guys are supposed to work together in your shared space. Sometimes that means helping your partner out by cleaning up their lunch containers or putting away the coffee mug they left out. Getting weird and saying \u201cit\u2019s not *my* mess\u201d is selfish and defeats the purpose of living with a *partner*. If it starts to become unequal, then yea, that\u2019s a huge problem. But good god, they\u2019re *lunch containers*. Unless there\u2019s something specifically disgusting about them, just do your boyfriend a favour and clean them.", "Why doesn\u2019t he wash them as soon as he brings them in the house?", "ESH if I wash the dishes I wash all the dishes no matter what or who\u2019s meal it was.", "ESH. Lunchboxes are dishes so why were you surprised to clean them when you were already doing the dishes? \nHis attitude was also not the finest tbh like a simple yes would\u2019ve been enough.", "It sounds like you split the dish washing duties - if on a night he was scheduled for after dinner washing, he would have washed the lunch dishes when he got home then he's the A H for leaving them for you. Basically, if he did something out of the norm so he could have this power play of directing you, then you have a different problem that needs to be addressed. Is he feeling powerless or less powerful? Is it a home problem or a work problem? Are the bosses coming down on him at work and he's consiously or unconsiously reacting at home? Does he feel less powerful than you and acting this way?", "Yes. I agree that this is the grown up approach to washing up. You do ALL the dirty dishes, or else its just gross. It's so petty to leave them there because they \"aren't yours\". I mean if they aren't rinsed and are actively gross to deal with, that's another converstaion. Because he should be bringing home his lunch containers rinsed out.  \n\nAssuming they weren't gross, this is just petty sniping at your supposed SO over chores, like children.

If you share labor and your job is \"doing dishes\" that means doing whatever dishes are dirty.", "Sometimes it\u2019s impossible to rinse the containers at work.

This is common sharing of duties and you don't leave dirty dishes in the sink just because they aren't yours. \"Could you clean those up\" hardly sounds like a harsh tone, but she made a stink about something stupid and petty, so she's the AH, BF is responding to an AH move.", "Fair point.\n\nI still think the request would have benefited from a \"please,\" but you're right there's no trace of tone to begin with.", "oh. The horror.", "Don't care about Reddit meltdowns, they are skewed anyways. \n\nMy stance has always been. A relationship should be between equals. If one person is bringing more to the table in terms of finance the other person contributes by taking care of home. That's how an equal partnership works. What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.", "That's not always possible.\n\nIf one person earns 3x the other person, but both are working full time jobs, are they then supposed to have the 1/4 cash contributor doing 3x the house work? This is a situation that's ripe for breeding resentment, I don't care who's the higher earner, male or female.\n\nIn my view, once off work basic house work is worth the same completed by either person, so it should be divided equally. The only way one person does more is if the they work less, either as a stay at home parent/partner or if they work part time."]}
