I have worked here just over a year, but Rob has worked here for 7 years, and Bill around 13 years. While Bill is incredibly nice and respectful, I've had problems with Rob being way too handsy and making comments/jokes that make me uncomfortable.\n\nPart of the problem was that at first the way he acted wasn't malicious and then things got worse over time. At first, he really only did \"endearing\" things like following me and liking my pictures on Instagram or complimenting my tattoos or outfits... I even used to joke around with him.\n\nThings got out of hand when he started doing things like referring to me as his \"work wife\", touching / squeezing me, staring, make comments about my body such as \"You know what you're doing wearing those jeans\" or just straight up catcall me when I would do things like walk in/ walk out.\n\nEach time I would try to laugh it off and say \"that's a weird thing to say\" or \"buy me dinner first\" because I wanted to avoid conflict. But once things escalated to a certain point the way he acted wasn't funny anymore, it was creepy. Especially considering that he is a married man with two kids.\n\nI went to management a few months ago because Rob \"accidentally\" grabbed my breast. I made a formal report about the incident and about how the rest of his behavior made me uncomfortable, I explained everything. I was told they would meet with him, but that I need to be more direct with Rob and not joke back with him as this probably made the situation worse. \n\nAfter his meeting, Bob apologized and said he never meant to make me uncomfortable. He insisted that but that he was just joking and that he didn't mean anything by it, calling it \"banter\".\n\nFor a while Rob was completely normal and polite. But slowly he fell back into his previous behavior, starting after he learned that my longtime boyfriend and I had broken up a month ago. Only now he would follow the harassment with \"ha-ha kidding\" or if I would call him out for staring/touching he would say it was an accident.\n\nThis all came to a head when the other day he asked me to help him with something when I went to get a chair, he told me that he already had one and gestured to his lap... but it was \"ha-ha just a joke\". I told him to stop but he kept laughing and told me to chill out. \n\nI left our office space and went to our manager's office and told them that Rob was giving me problems again and that I didn\u2019t know what to do anymore and that I wanted to quit.\n\nLong story short, Rob was fired, and I agreed to stay with the company.  After Rob was fired, he sent me a text saying that I am being completely ridiculous for getting him fired over sexual harassment when because that is completely untrue. He sent me a whole rant about how I was the problem for going along with it and that I twisted the narrative.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1675895217, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xcwai/aita_for_getting_my_coworker_fired/", "score": 151, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Be safe.", "NTA\n\nI guarantee that you weren't the first woman he sexually harassed, but you might be the last.", "NTA\n\nRob is a classic case of fuck around and find out. He was given more than ample warning to correct the situation, chose to ignore it, and now is having a narcissistic fit over something that has jack to do with you.\n\nWell well well, Rob, if it isn\u2019t the consequences of your own actions here to bite you in the ass\u2026", "NTA.  He's upset that his bad behaviour finally has real consequences.  Men like Rob hate when they find out it's actually 2023 and not 1953 and that many workplaces won't accept behaviour like this anymore.  Good for you for standing up for yourself.  \n\nYour joking responses early on are a completely understandable response.  Many women will respond that way as a safety mechanism (\"if I smile and laugh he won't get angry at me\").  HE is the one to blame for HIS bad behaviour.  You are not in the least responsible for him being a complete boor.", "NTA! Emphatically NTA! This is sexual harassment. \"Ha Ha, just a joke\" is a dead giveaway. He knew it was wrong and tried to make it a joke. I just went through my yearly harassment/discrimination training and there are a couple of incidents in your post that are almost mirror examples from those training videos. Although saying \"buy me dinner first\" certainly wasn't the best choice, at least management told you this, and it sounds as though you made you position clear. you did not want his advances.YOU didn't get Rob fired. ROB got Rob fired by behaving in an inappropriate way.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like he received plenty of warnings.  A professional 36-year-old should have learned earlier the easy way.  Because he didn't, he needs to learn the hard way.", "NTA.  First, it\u2019s very likely that your complaint was not the first.  He has worked there for 7 years.  Any other complaints made about him would have been confidential and you would not have known about them.\n\nBut I expect Human Resources at your company probably had a few complaints before yours.  So don\u2019t beat yourself up by assuming that you alone were responsible.\n\nBut if your complaints were the only ones, so be it.  He was completely inappropriate with you and just couldn\u2019t stop (that\u2019s why I believe there had to have been prior incidents).  I hope he learns a lesson, but probably not.", "NTA. He is lucky he got another chance to quit his gross ass behavior. I'd also show HR the texts he sent you as an FYI so they're aware he is still harassing you.", "NTA.\n\nI remember when sexual harassment was tolerated.  Usually in a situation like this, you had to do something like get your ex-football player 6\u20194 250 lb friend to swing by the office, tell Rob he was your boyfriend, and have a little talk with him.\n\nWomen would help each other if they knew a guy like that to come around if there were \u201cproblems\u201d.\n\nGood times!", "He sent me a whole rant about how I was the problem\n\nNTA, you did nothing wrong, he's just angry that he had to face the consequences of his actions", "NTA.

And you deserve to do your job in peace.", "NTA \n\nWhile you joking back at first probably did make him think it was ok\u2026.you are NOT to blame for this.. especially after the FIRST time you reported it it should have ended there.  Yes, you did play along at first, but you know, I don\u2019t like the wording your HR used\u2026 about you joking back makes the situation worse, the reason I feel that was is because in a way maybe you felt if you did joke back he\u2019d back off? I get it. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened to you. Especially since he\u2019s been warned once. Saying those things to anyone is inappropriate in any environment.\n\nEdited for spelling", "NTA - and him continuing to contact you about this is absolutely harassment. Tell him to lose your number or you're gonna file a police report for harassment.", "NTA\n\n\nHe knew exactly what he was doing.", "NTA-  Nobody, man nor woman should be subjected to sexual harassment.  When it comes to Rob, he was spoken and should have learned his lesson, which he didn't. Its is own fault for the way he acted.   Just curious, do you know if Bill said anything to him to stop or was Bill questioned when you made your initial complaint?", "To be clear, you didn\u2019t \u201cget him fired,\u201d he knowingly continued with behaviors that he had been asked to discontinue. Telling a person that they are overreacting is another way to make you doubt yourself. In fact, you under reacted for too long. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou didn't get him fired. He did that all on his own. You just had the audacity to hold him accountable for his behavior. Gasp!", "NTA, and sorry you went through that .", "NTA. Well done for reporting his harassment. Absolutely no way should you have to put up with that in your place of work, or anywhere. He's an asshole for still trying to blame you for his behaviour. I hope you've blocked him now and that you don't hear from him again.", "NTA. He deserves exactly what he got. Those are not appropriate statements at work and they are not appropriate jokes at work especially since you vocalized your discomfort. Good for you for standing up for yourself!", "NTA. He knew exactly what he was doing and got exactly what he deserved.", "Holy shit NTA. What he did is not ok and saying \"haha just kidding\" after every inappropriate comment doesn't make it is joke. You definitely did the right thing. \n\nI had a coworker (45m) who made comments like that to me at my first big corporate job. I was young(20f) and didn't know better and never reported him. I recently found out this wasn't an isolated incident and a current coworker of mine also used to work with him and he did the same things to her including stalking her. It made me sick to hear and I regret so much more not reporting it.", "Most assuredly NTA.\n\nHow many decades have workplaces been saying that such \"banter\" creates a hostile work environment?  This isn't new ground anywhere.  Claiming \"just kidding\" doesn't change the fact that this was sexual harassment---*especially* since he'd already been reported to HR.\n\nPersisting in such behavior is just him hammering the nails into the lid of his own employment coffin.   And HR could see the potential lawsuit from orbit if they didn't fire him.", "It goes without saying - NTA. Op please don\u2019t take on any feeling of responsibility for any of this. Rob\u2019s behaviour got him fired. \n\nSome lessons I\u2019ve learned over the years: \n\n-\tIf someone has to add \u2018just joking\u2019 to a statement - it wasn\u2019t a joke. \n-\tIf someone tells you you\u2019re being overly sensitive- 9/10 times they\u2019re being an insensitive jerk\n-\tReal banter is a two way interaction and based on mutual respect and understanding. If it\u2019s only going one way it\u2019s bullying or harassment. \n-\tTrying to avoid conflict when you\u2019re being harassed is not \u2018going along with it\u2019 nor an invitation to continue.", "NTA and I\u2019m so sorry that you had to put up with behavior at all. Maybe at first it was banter but after the first warning from the company he knew better and no woman should deal with this Bs", "NTA - I\u2019m so sorry you experienced that. People like him need to be fired, they need to understand that type of \u201cjoking\u201d is neither joking nor is it acceptable in the workplace.", "NTA\n\nThis is sexual harassment to a tee. Rob was warned, he f-ed around and found out.", "NTA, you warned him, the company warned, and he still continued it. That's on him.", "you post is misleading. you did not get him fired.

Get the police involved.", ">I've had problems with Rob being way too handsy and making comments/jokes that make me uncomfortable.\n\nI don't even need to read past THAT to say that he should have been fired.
