My husband and I have had our share of problems. When I moved it was all of the intention for him to follow.  Now that I have settled he has decided he isn\u2019t coming and here is the story as to why:  \nI work outside of the home and bring most of the $$ in for bills.  When I moved I was paying for my new place. (I moved for a  better opportunity ) I was still paying for cell phone , internet, car insurance, health insurance, Amazon orders ( he has a small business) and helped him with $500 then $700 of his rent. So he started ghosting me.  Not returning calls. All the while telling me he loves me and is coming down soon. I decided to go up to see him a couple weekends ago. I drive all night. Got there at 5:30 in the morning to surprise him.  I surprised THEM.  He has moved another female into my house.  He still is expecting me to pay for the things I was paying!  \n\nHis side of the story is he never had intentions of coming . He just said that.  And if I were back up there I would be paying for that anyway.  I had a long talk with the live in who thought he was separated and getting a divorce. He had been lying to both of us. I don\u2019t want to be responsible party on the house up there anymore.  He is behind on the rent a month now and with late fees owes over $2700.

Call the landlord on his sorry ass.", "\"I don\u2019t want to be responsible party\", that's unfortunate, because if you signed the lease you are responsible. Your name is on the lease and if the landlord evicts him, they are also evicting you. Not a good look.\n\nI'm not sure what the landlord would do with what you tell her. The apartment is behind $2700 and that's what she will lead with in eviction court. Eviction courts and landlords don't care if the resident has been lying to his mistress.\n\nNTA but be careful about an eviction landing on your credit history.", "Maybe not an A H, but it might not be a smart move. If he gets thrown out, maybe he can make some kind of retaliatory claim.

Call it a \"loan,\" to be paid off when the divorce is finalized. See what a lawyer says.", "NTA, necessarily, but not smart either.  And not really your landlord's business.  Your landlord doesn't care about  your internal family drama.  Your landlord just wants to get paid.  \n\nWhat you **should** be doing here is you and your husband need to talk about your separation.  And once you've defined the terms of your separation, you make clear you're not willing to assume the majority of costs for him to continue living in that house.  \n\nOnce you and your husband figure out these details, **then** you go to the landlord, tell the landlord that you are separated, and ask to amend the lease.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
