I thought he was past all that I guess that he is exactly what I said a real monster who cares for only himself.  I am gonna do what I need to do to make sure that I am happy.  I am responsible for my happiness. And I have learned that no one but me can allow anyone to harm me.  I have to love myself first. When you have been put down and mentally abused like I have it\u2019s hard to look at yourself positively. But I\u2019m trying that\u2019s all I can do at this point", "I did call her.  She wasn\u2019t available.  I have left a message for her to return my call. In the meantime I have drafted a letter to give her in writing.", "Don\u2019t wait another minute", "If the lease is in your name, terminate it and inform him. He can apply for a new lease on his own. Also get that divorce going so his bills don\u2019t become your bills for longer than necessary.", "It isn\u2019t vindictive to allow **natural consequences** to take its course. You are **not** going out of the way to harm him. That is a key component. You are simply pulling back. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you that you are being vindictive.", "Try to see him for who he is now. \n\nNot who he was, who he pretended to be or who you wanted him to be. People change. He's become someone who is not worthy of your love and support.", "He had 16 years to plan his life in such a way that he would have funds if something happened to you. Well something happened. Don\u2019t feel bad - he has a backup plan. His cash business probably does a lot better than what you know btw.", "it hasnt hit you fully yet but it will. im so sory he did this to you. please go get a check up because i highly doubt that he used protection.", "She will if she has to evict. A landlord will ALWAYS act in their own best interest. Putting things off on the misguided hope that somehow things will be alright, will not do you any good. You must be proactive in this situation. \n\nAdditionally, not sure of your local laws but evictions where I am from have to be for everyone on whose names are on the lease.", "ive been that broken and im so sorry you are in that place. op, please let us help you get strength. please get therapy to help you. we care about you even though we are just strangers. you deserve better and the only way you can get there is put your foot down and cut him off. and dont fall for his crap of lovebombing and fake im sorrys. hes only gonna be sorry because he cant take advantage anymore. please protect your money. please change every one of the passwords so he cant get into your emails and lock you out of your own accounts. because if hes dirty enough, he will do that. hes mean and dishonest and doesnt care about hurting you.\n\ntake care of yourself. we are here to encourage you. dont give in to him. please let us know what the landlord says after you tell her you moved.", "It does ok but he doesn\u2019t handle money well. So I know he has nothing as far as a stash.  He doesn\u2019t even have a bank account.  And he is definitely not on mine", "I haven\u2019t been with him since I left. But I will do so next week. He prolly knew her before I left", "Trust me I don\u2019t. Moving was the best thing that I could have done.  Now I can break that trauma bond for good and move forward.  Thank you", "oh but he will try to come back once he misses the money", "oh hun, he gives no shits about you so why should you care if hes homeless? his homelessness is of his own doing! he wont be homeless, he will go find someone else to drag down. let that be someone elses problem. you deserve better.", "In your shoes, I wouldn't care if he ended up on the street after the way he treated you but you are kinder than me.", "You stopping paying his rent does not are him homeless. He not paying his rent is what will make him homeless. Stop paying his bills. He cheating on you, lying to you and completely taking advantage. You are not a monster. Self-preservation is necessary here. NTA al all.", "Actions (his) have consequences. Don't do it to be spiteful, do it because it is the only rational thing for you to do in these circumstances. He lied about moving, he cheated on you, while allowing you to cover him financially. He'll need to go live with family or friends for a while, or he needs to start looking out for himself financially. Not your responsibility any more. Get your name off the lease so you aren't liable for any damage, and then start untangling all the other legal stuff (joint bank accounts etc).", "OP, if this was your best friend and her husband did this to her, would you tell her not to take action because he might get evicted due to his assholishness?", "There are times for kindness, for being nice, and for being the bigger person. \n\nThis is not one of them. \n\nYou have been lied to and taken advantage of. This is how the chips fall when you do that. YOU will not responsible for him being evicted. He will be. Don\u2019t get confused here. He made a choice.", "He will have to figure out how to pay for everything on his own anyway. It\u2019s time for him to find his own apartment that he can afford based on his own income", "Lock down any accounts he might have access to. Change every password. Open a new bank account (at a different bank) and start moving all your money there.\nUse the money you were spending on him for a divorce lawyer and a therapist. \n\nYou are intentionally harming yourself by allowing this to continue. You deserve better.", "You\u2019re not intention ally doing harm if he gets evicted!  Rather, it\u2019s a consequence of HIS actions.", "Listen, I'm a \"I don't want to intentionally hurt others\" person. \n\nBUT I learned that if I don't do what's good FOR ME regardless of other people, then I am screwing myself over. And where are they? Nowhere to be found. \n\nDo not light yourself on fire to make someone else warm.", "he intentionally harmed you and will keep doing it if you let him. op its not mean to stand up for yourself. please get therapy because you need to get some strength to stand up for yourself. love yourself enough to say i will not let anyone treat me like im dumb. hes treating you like youre dumb. you arent mad enough at what hes done to you, why? im not saying to harm him but youre too nice because you keep putting him before you even though hes done this incredibly awful thing.", "Don't let the 16 years impact your decision making.  Look up the term Sunk Cost Fallacy.", "This isn\u2019t \u201cintentionally doing harm\u201d to him. \n\nThis isn\u2019t even about him. This is about *you*, and the fact that you were being conned out of your hard-earned money through lies and incomplete information. This is about *your* need to stop spending money on a person who will never repay it, who is not entitled to it, and who only received it because he misrepresented who he was and what his intentions were. \n\nIf someone promised you a car, and you started making regular payments towards that car without ever laying eyes on it based on that person\u2019s assurances that the car exists and was on its way to you, only to find out that the car *never* existed and they had bought *themselves* a cute little motorcycle with all the money you gave them, what\u2019s the first thing you\u2019d do?", "Thank you for saying that. I have actually called the landlord and left her a message to call me to discuss business. I am drafting a letter as we speak and I\u2019m ridding myself of all this drama.  He made this bed let him lay in it for sure.  This actually feels good to let this weight go", "Exactly. And make sure the passwords are changed *before* he finds out you've notified the landlord.", "I have started therapy yes and now I am realizing how these things have affected me in all aspects of my life. You are right I don\u2019t stand up for myself at all.  When I do he always guilted me into apologizing to him.  Now I don\u2019t even know why I apologized all the time.  He never has taken responsibility for anything and asking him to tell the truth is a joke. His truth is whatever comes out of his mouth true or not.  It is a hard pill to swallow to think that that\u2019s all you were to someone.  And yet that is all I was. I\u2019m angry and I\u2019m hurt. And now I gotta pick up all these pieces of my heart he has shattered and try to make sense out of it.  I don\u2019t know where to start.  Calling the landlord sounded like a good start to me.", "He effed around. Move him into the \"finding out\" stage.", "Please call and keep us updated", "op needs to understand that hes screwing her over! what if they damage that apartment? op has to pay for that...", "Good point"]}
