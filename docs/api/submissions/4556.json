They had a baby they didn't want (unprotected sex no abortion) and gave it to me. I was friends with this guy for a couple of years and my wife was infertile, and was devastated we couldn't have kids. So they gave us the baby and life was good until the pandemic hit. The pandemic hit hard for us and my wife lost her job. Thankfully, I got a better job and make money now enough to support needs and barely scrape by for my Daughters tuition. \n\nNow on the other hand, my friend and his wife is living on cruise ships. He makes a lot of money so much that he basically lives on cruises and owns a nice condo in Honolulu. They wanted to visit my daughter and during dinner (fancy restaurant payed by them) offered to pay 20% of my daughters tuition. My daughter said why not more and they told her that she wasn't their responsibility as they gave her to me and my wife. Dinner was very awkward after that and outside I called my friend an AH for not paying my daughters tuition. I said he makes very good money and he can afford to pay the tuition. He told me off and left and went back to his fancy condo might I add. While my daughter was in her room crying claiming she hates her father. So much that she blocked all contact with her biological parents and claimed she hates them and never wants to speak to them again.\n\nI dont know how I will cover the 50 grand.

They also wanted to give her 5 thousand dollars to spend on food, which I think they need to send more.  \n\n\nOh, and apparently they also paid for 75% of his daughter's car.

If you love her, and you consider her to be your daughter, then it is not any other adult's responsibility to financially provide for her education, including the adults whose egg and sperm created her. And that's the grossest part of all of this: that you don't even see that you are literally negating your own parental connection to your daughter for a money grab. You're saying that she's your daughter - except when you want money from your well-off friend, and . . . then she's his? It's beyond horrifying.\n\nDo what every other parent who does not have a wealthy friend does to manage their child's education. You should have been saving money, or take out student loans, or apply for scholarships. That man is NOT her parent. If he were, you wouldn't be.

As generally happens when you adopt a child.\n\nI note how you have worded your post to make your friends sound reckless and foolish in becoming pregnant in the first place, to try and swing how people saw this. However, if you do not fully understand the responsibilities and financial commitments as an adoptive parent, before going through the adoption process, *you* are the one behaving irresponsibly and foolishly.\n\nThey are still in her life and take her out, buy her gifts, paid for 75% of A CAR and have offered to pay 20% of her school fees, none of which they are obliged to do and I think you and your daughter have been incredibly fortunate in that respect.\n\nWhat has happened financially to a huge proportion of the world post covid (including me) really sucks and life is difficult. But none of that is your friend\u2019s fault and they were offering you assistance with no caveats.\n\nI feel that offer is probably (quite rightly) off the table now but if I were you, I would do everything I can to try to repair the damage in theirs and your daughter\u2019s relationship.\n\n\nORIGINAL QUESTIONS - What arrangements were made when you took custody of their daughter, financially? \n\nAre there any clauses in the adoption papers?", "Info: you say \u201cgave\u201d you their daughter.

Okay then, so you adopted her legally and now you feel that they should pay for her education. YTA here, big time!!

You should be horrifyingly embarrassed.", "YTA\n\nYou adopted a child. She solely belongs to you and your wife. The 2 of you are the only people on earth who are responsible for her support.

I was friends with this guy for a couple of years and my wife was infertile, and was devastated we couldn't have kids. So they gave us the baby and life was good until the pandemic hit. The pandemic hit hard for us and my wife lost her job. Thankfully, I got a better job and make money now enough to support needs and barely scrape by for my Daughters tuition. \n\nNow on the other hand, my friend and his wife is living on cruise ships. He makes a lot of money so much that he basically lives on cruises and owns a nice condo in Honolulu. They wanted to visit my daughter and during dinner (fancy restaurant payed by them) offered to pay 20% of my daughters tuition. My daughter said why not more and they told her that she wasn't their responsibility as they gave her to me and my wife. Dinner was very awkward after that and outside I called my friend an AH for not paying my daughters tuition. I said he makes very good money and he can afford to pay the tuition. He told me off and left and went back to his fancy condo might I add. While my daughter was in her room crying claiming she hates her father. So much that she blocked all contact with her biological parents and claimed she hates them and never wants to speak to them again.\n\nI dont know how I will cover the 50 grand.

They're offering to pay a fifth of her tuition, full cost of housing and give her a good sized eating budget and you said no because you wanted more??!! That's entitlement and then some. \nYou adopted her, you are solely responsible for her, but they were willing to give her 15K plus housing which is easily 10K as well. You complain about them willing to shell out 25+K a year??? WTF man? YTA", "They have no legal or moral reason to give her a cent. They\u2019re being very, very generous.", "YTA, so greedy so entitled and instead of graciously accepting, you expect even more! You're unbelievable.", "Why are you holding so much resentment to people who chose to give up their child? You sound so jealous but also angry theirs lives didn\u2019t turn out horribly. Obviously they have more disposable income without caring for a child. Get over yourself. You made a choice to adopt the child and your daughter should be lucky anyone is paying anything at all. YTA.", "They\u2019re not obligated to help with any of the costs, for all intents and purposes, she\u2019s YOUR daughter, not theirs. That\u2019s what adoption is. They\u2019re being super generous helping out that much, that\u2019s still a huge amount of money, and would help you out so much not having to try and pay for dorm/apartment fees. Just be grateful you\u2019re getting so much help from them already to assist her getting through college. What an entitled asshat. YTA. Seriously. How can you not see how helpful and generous that is of them to do?!", "Wow you are so greedy, unbelievable!", "20% tuition and all of room and board. YTA with a huge load of entitled idiocy thrown in. What in the world is wrong with you?", "And now the offer is zilch.\n\nWell done!", "Jesus, how are you not completely embarrassed?  If my daughter asked for more after getting such an extremely generous offer I would be mortified and worried I completely failed as a parent.", ">which I think they need to send more.\n\nWhy???? **SHE'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY! SHE'S YOUR DAUGHTER**!! WTF?!", "Whaaaaat the fuck.... are you serious??? I would have been so so psyched to have someone pay for my apartment and send me $5000 in food money when I was a college student. I never would have asked for more because that's already a lot.", "I'm gonna go so far as to say ESH except the daughter.  She shouldn't have said \"why not more\", but she's young and impressionable.\n\nBio parents should have kept their distance.  Rolling in after 17 years of (reading between the lines) what sounds like ignoring their biologic kid and offering to pay a fraction of tuition is in pretty poor taste and if they knew anything about OP's financial position they should have seen the inevitable implosion coming.", "I saw that after I made this comment I cannot believe how entitled this person is. They should be embarrassed", "Thank  you!!!", "Not just any college, but \u201csome college.\u201d", "lol. Seriously though, my bachelors and masters degree combined cost less than half of what he is paying for tuition. I\u2019m assuming this is undergrad? There has to be cheaper options. OP find a community college, your daughter will make new friends.", "I have a son about to go to college, and would do a backflip for joy if someone made us this offer.", "Play stupid games. Win stupid prizes. Congrats.", "You done fucked up and fucked up bad. Their offer was generous as hell. She is not their daughter.  YTA", "Well I guess you all learned a valuable lesson that day.", "You should have been grateful, they made an incredibly generous offer that they had no obligation to.\n\nYTA", "That's what happens when you fuck around. You eventually find out. You found out. YTA"]}
