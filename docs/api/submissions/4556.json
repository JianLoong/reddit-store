They had a baby they didn't want (unprotected sex no abortion) and gave it to me. I was friends with this guy for a couple of years and my wife was infertile, and was devastated we couldn't have kids. So they gave us the baby and life was good until the pandemic hit. The pandemic hit hard for us and my wife lost her job. Thankfully, I got a better job and make money now enough to support needs and barely scrape by for my Daughters tuition. \n\nNow on the other hand, my friend and his wife is living on cruise ships. He makes a lot of money so much that he basically lives on cruises and owns a nice condo in Honolulu. They wanted to visit my daughter and during dinner (fancy restaurant payed by them) offered to pay 20% of my daughters tuition. My daughter said why not more and they told her that she wasn't their responsibility as they gave her to me and my wife. Dinner was very awkward after that and outside I called my friend an AH for not paying my daughters tuition. I said he makes very good money and he can afford to pay the tuition. He told me off and left and went back to his fancy condo might I add. While my daughter was in her room crying claiming she hates her father. So much that she blocked all contact with her biological parents and claimed she hates them and never wants to speak to them again.\n\nI dont know how I will cover the 50 grand.

They also wanted to give her 5 thousand dollars to spend on food, which I think they need to send more.  \n\n\nOh, and apparently they also paid for 75% of his daughter's car.

If you love her, and you consider her to be your daughter, then it is not any other adult's responsibility to financially provide for her education, including the adults whose egg and sperm created her. And that's the grossest part of all of this: that you don't even see that you are literally negating your own parental connection to your daughter for a money grab. You're saying that she's your daughter - except when you want money from your well-off friend, and . . . then she's his? It's beyond horrifying.\n\nDo what every other parent who does not have a wealthy friend does to manage their child's education. You should have been saving money, or take out student loans, or apply for scholarships. That man is NOT her parent. If he were, you wouldn't be.

As generally happens when you adopt a child.\n\nI note how you have worded your post to make your friends sound reckless and foolish in becoming pregnant in the first place, to try and swing how people saw this. However, if you do not fully understand the responsibilities and financial commitments as an adoptive parent, before going through the adoption process, *you* are the one behaving irresponsibly and foolishly.\n\nThey are still in her life and take her out, buy her gifts, paid for 75% of A CAR and have offered to pay 20% of her school fees, none of which they are obliged to do and I think you and your daughter have been incredibly fortunate in that respect.\n\nWhat has happened financially to a huge proportion of the world post covid (including me) really sucks and life is difficult. But none of that is your friend\u2019s fault and they were offering you assistance with no caveats.\n\nI feel that offer is probably (quite rightly) off the table now but if I were you, I would do everything I can to try to repair the damage in theirs and your daughter\u2019s relationship.\n\n\nORIGINAL QUESTIONS - What arrangements were made when you took custody of their daughter, financially? \n\nAre there any clauses in the adoption papers?", "Info: you say \u201cgave\u201d you their daughter.

Okay then, so you adopted her legally and now you feel that they should pay for her education. YTA here, big time!!

You should be horrifyingly embarrassed.", "YTA\n\nYou adopted a child. She solely belongs to you and your wife. The 2 of you are the only people on earth who are responsible for her support.

I was friends with this guy for a couple of years and my wife was infertile, and was devastated we couldn't have kids. So they gave us the baby and life was good until the pandemic hit. The pandemic hit hard for us and my wife lost her job. Thankfully, I got a better job and make money now enough to support needs and barely scrape by for my Daughters tuition. \n\nNow on the other hand, my friend and his wife is living on cruise ships. He makes a lot of money so much that he basically lives on cruises and owns a nice condo in Honolulu. They wanted to visit my daughter and during dinner (fancy restaurant payed by them) offered to pay 20% of my daughters tuition. My daughter said why not more and they told her that she wasn't their responsibility as they gave her to me and my wife. Dinner was very awkward after that and outside I called my friend an AH for not paying my daughters tuition. I said he makes very good money and he can afford to pay the tuition. He told me off and left and went back to his fancy condo might I add. While my daughter was in her room crying claiming she hates her father. So much that she blocked all contact with her biological parents and claimed she hates them and never wants to speak to them again.\n\nI dont know how I will cover the 50 grand.
