They had a baby they didn't want (unprotected sex no abortion) and gave it to me. I was friends with this guy for a couple of years and my wife was infertile, and was devastated we couldn't have kids. So they gave us the baby and life was good until the pandemic hit. The pandemic hit hard for us and my wife lost her job. Thankfully, I got a better job and make money now enough to support needs and barely scrape by for my Daughters tuition. \n\nNow on the other hand, my friend and his wife is living on cruise ships. He makes a lot of money so much that he basically lives on cruises and owns a nice condo in Honolulu. They wanted to visit my daughter and during dinner (fancy restaurant payed by them) offered to pay 20% of my daughters tuition. My daughter said why not more and they told her that she wasn't their responsibility as they gave her to me and my wife. Dinner was very awkward after that and outside I called my friend an AH for not paying my daughters tuition. I said he makes very good money and he can afford to pay the tuition. He told me off and left and went back to his fancy condo might I add. While my daughter was in her room crying claiming she hates her father. So much that she blocked all contact with her biological parents and claimed she hates them and never wants to speak to them again.\n\nI dont know how I will cover the 50 grand.

If you love her, and you consider her to be your daughter, then it is not any other adult's responsibility to financially provide for her education, including the adults whose egg and sperm created her.

You're saying that she's your daughter - except when you want money from your well-off friend, and . . . then she's his? It's beyond horrifying.\n\nDo what every other parent who does not have a wealthy friend does to manage their child's education.

As generally happens when you adopt a child.\n\nI note how you have worded your post to make your friends sound reckless and foolish in becoming pregnant in the first place, to try and swing how people saw this. However, if you do not fully understand the responsibilities and financial commitments as an adoptive parent, before going through the adoption process, *you* are the one behaving irresponsibly and foolishly.\n\nThey are still in her life and take her out, buy her gifts, paid for 75% of A CAR and have offered to pay 20% of her school fees, none of which they are obliged to do and I think you and your daughter have been incredibly fortunate in that respect.\n\nWhat has happened financially to a huge proportion of the world post covid (including me) really sucks and life is difficult. But none of that is your friend\u2019s fault and they were offering you assistance with no caveats.\n\nI feel that offer is probably (quite rightly) off the table now but if I were you, I would do everything I can to try to repair the damage in theirs and your daughter\u2019s relationship.\n\n\nORIGINAL QUESTIONS - What arrangements were made when you took custody of their daughter, financially? \n\nAre there any clauses in the adoption papers?", "Info: you say \u201cgave\u201d you their daughter.

I was friends with this guy for a couple of years and my wife was infertile, and was devastated we couldn't have kids. So they gave us the baby and life was good until the pandemic hit. The pandemic hit hard for us and my wife lost her job. Thankfully, I got a better job and make money now enough to support needs and barely scrape by for my Daughters tuition. \n\nNow on the other hand, my friend and his wife is living on cruise ships. He makes a lot of money so much that he basically lives on cruises and owns a nice condo in Honolulu. They wanted to visit my daughter and during dinner (fancy restaurant payed by them) offered to pay 20% of my daughters tuition. My daughter said why not more and they told her that she wasn't their responsibility as they gave her to me and my wife. Dinner was very awkward after that and outside I called my friend an AH for not paying my daughters tuition. I said he makes very good money and he can afford to pay the tuition. He told me off and left and went back to his fancy condo might I add. While my daughter was in her room crying claiming she hates her father. So much that she blocked all contact with her biological parents and claimed she hates them and never wants to speak to them again.\n\nI dont know how I will cover the 50 grand.

YTA", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "There is nothing wrong with deciding you don\u2019t want to be a parent.  This idea that you have to be broke or on drugs to make an adoption plan for your child is nuts.  Some people are not cut out for parenting and that\u2019s fine.  Rather than \u201cgiving up\u201d their child by having an abortion, they placed her with their friends.  They got to be parents because of this.  The fact that the bio parents gave money every now and then is very generous and not required.  Sounds like the adoptive parents did a really poor job of raising her and she has turned out with their poor lack of morals and gratitude.", "While in some cases adoption happens because you don't want the child. It's not always the case. Infact many times adoption occurs because the bio parent(s) want more for their child than they can provide.\n\nIn this case it seems like the bio parents gave up the child because they themselves didn't want children. To offer money towards their education shows they care in their own way. However they are right in saying that they are not this girls parents and don't actually owe them anything. \n\nIt very much sounds like OP is jealous of the life this couple is living. I'm sure if their financial situation hadn't changed, they would probably be annoyed by the offer and argue the bio parents are over stepping the mark", "In OP's comments, he said 'Yes we adopted'. Also said 'The court told them they didn't have to pay at all.'", "I'm definitely not commenting on the reasons for adoption.  There are numerous reasons, most of them very good ones that leave the child better off.\n\nBut if an adopted child's biological parents are alive and together and in good health mental and physical and not impoverished the *feeling* of rejection by the child is inevitable.", "I didn't mean to imply that it means you don't love them.\n\nRegardless of intent the logical question all adopted children ask (even if they know nothing of their biologic parents) is \"why did they give me away\".\n\nThat certainly doesn't imply any fault, there are plenty of people who are incapable of raising a child for whatever reason and plenty (most even, I would posit) adopted kids are better off than if they'd been raised by their biologic parents.\n\nBut it is impossible to avoid those feelings as an adopted child.  Working through that is a fundamental necessity.\n\nBio parents flitting in and out of your life and living on cruise ships far from home, but coming home to offer gifts of money are bound to bring those feelings back.", "Ok I can concede to what you say here. Just the first comment of yours said there's no more concrete way of proving you don't care about a child than giving them away.", "Is this AITA, or Choosing Beggars? Stop saying they gave you your daughter- she\u2019s not a piece of property. You adopted her, and she is your responsibility. 20% of her tuition is extremely generous to offer YOUR daughter. The fact that she\u2019s in a huff and demanding they give her full tuition says a lot about how you raised her. YTA.", "i\u2019m going to cut his daughter some slack. he told her to ask for more.", "I think OP lives in this delusion where he feels he helped the biological parents out by taking care of their unwanted child, what he doesn't seem to understand is that a lot of infertile couples would die for the chance they're given, and the biological parents likely saw it as them doing OP a huge favor.", "You couldn\u2019t have said it any better. I wonder if this adoption is legal makes ya wonder. Such entitlement on OP and daughters part I would say", "The biological parents had no responsibility. The adoptive parents should have made it very clear (and been very clear within themselves) that anything she receives from them is a generous gift from friends, not an obligation due to genetics.", "Thanks for clarifying that and not making me scroll down for that info. It wasn't clear in OP's post.", "I'm going to guess some of that toxic crap came from OP, because OP seems to radiate envy and sour grapes. \"We were hit hard by global situation, and they have money, it's sooooo unfair\\~\"", "That's part of it too. They were close friends before the adoption. Are they just supposed to cut off their friends because they adopted a child that happens to be theirs? Of course they'll be in each other's lives!\n\nOP and his wife haven't set properly defined boundaries and blur the lines. I don't think there's anything wrong with keeping the bio parents in their life. Again, they were close friends. But if you're going to do that, you need to have realistic exceptions and that includes the acknowledgement that adopting a child means that the child is no longer theirs, and that goes *both* ways, not just for them not butting into parenting decisions, but also for OP and his wife to understand that it means they are 100% responsible for this child as much as they would be if they were able to conceive", "That just utterly blows my mind. They gave OP their child. The helped support this child. They kept contact without boundary stomping (which is amazing for the child\u2019s well being). This is almost a dream scenario as far as adoptions go. And OP has the gall to bitch!!! Bio parents did everything right and don\u2019t deserve this.", "My close friend, who's in a same-sex relationship, once asked me if I'd ever consider donating an egg to him and his partner in the future. If I ever did, of course we'd remain friends and I'd be in the child's life, but that doesn't automatically make it a co-parenting situation.\n\nI don't think the relationship is that different from being a child's aunt/uncle or grandparents. You're in their life, and you might help them out financially and buy them nice gifts if you can afford it, but ultimately their parents are fully responsible for them.", "Equating bio parents flitting in and out of a child\u2019s life when they are supposed to be the primary caregiver is eons away from bio parents having contact with an adopted child. The latter still theoretically has people providing stability and a family and explaining everything going on. They\u2019re just\u2026so not comparable. Even if in this scenario it sounds like the parents who raised this girl didn\u2019t do their jobs well\u2014that\u2019s not on the bio parents, who were not obligated to keep that child but have clearly tried to offer some help. (And i say this as an adopted child with a fair amount of ~issues around the whole family thing.)", "You should edit this post OP! You\u2019re not the guys friend, the term is more \u201centitled leech\u201d. I personally hope that lovely couple never gives you or YOUR daughter a single cent more. \n\nThey didn\u2019t want a child, they knew you did. They went through an entire pregnancy and gave you the gift of a child that you both wanted (but definitely didn\u2019t deserve). Just because you aren\u2019t in a condo in Honolulu or financially privileged and instead having to be a parent to the child you very much CHOSE to raise, doesn\u2019t make people who are happier with themselves and their lives AHs for not giving you more free support than they already have. YTA, obviously, but you also won\u2019t agree with that if the comments are anything to go by\u2014so what exactly did you want from this post? \n\nStop acting like a bitter and miserable parent and be a better one. Be a better person in general, or else you and your daughter better get real used to not getting any help or support from anyone ever again.", "YTA. They gave the child to you. She is YOUR daughter, you are responsible for her. They offered to pay 20% and both you and your daughter were ungrateful, rude and acted entitled to them paying for her education. You have a couple of options, taking out student loans, sending her to a cheaper college, what isn't an option is demanding that someone else pay for your kids schooling.", "\nThese parents remind me of the old Geico commercials with the old lady and the pictures on her \"friend wall\". Her friend keeps saying, \"that's not how it works! That's not how any of this works!\" Everyone is telling OP this isn't how adoption works and he keeps arguing. \n\nOn the adoption front, I wonder if it was an open adoption. It would explain their daughter knowing said friends as her bio parents and possibly even thinking they'd pay for her schooling. I'm sure OP did nothing to quell that idea.\n\nOr if it's even a real post. He says he knew his friend for a while and they had an unwanted baby. OP and his wife couldn't have kids so friends gave them the baby. Yet in one of his replies he then claims they \"recognized\" the couple in court. \n\nWere Op and his wife just randomly hanging out in a courtroom baby shopping? Is that even a thing?", "Per OP's comment, he knew what the dinner was for and instructed his daughter to ask for more money because he felt it wasn't enough.\n\nAnd it's not 20% of tuition. It's 20% of tuition plus fully paying for room and board either on or off campus, and $5,000 spending money (per semester? That wasn't clear.)", "Yeah, like the simple answer is that if you can not afford tuition then she needs to take out loans, work or simply drop out and go to an affordable university. Tbh I would say 50 grand is on the higher side of tuition and OPs daughter could probably transfer to an equivalent or even better uni for less tuition.", "Aaand now he\u2019s not even getting 20%. Good work, team.", "Not to mention OP shouldn\u2019t be sending his daughter to a school He can\u2019t afford and expects someone else to pay for.  OP needs to explain to his daughter their financial difficulties mean she needs to attend a school More affordable with in their budget.", "It's pretty obvious that she's hearing her parents talk about how unfair it is that their friends are living this luxurious life while they raise \"their child\" from the way she reacted.\n\nI can't get over \"Gave her to them\" instead of adopted... There's definitely something wrong with their attitude about adoption and the way they've explained it to their daughter.", "I feel so sorry for this kid. Everyone's calling her entitled but what she is is massively screwed up. All the actual adults involved needed to get their roles and responsibilities much clearer from the start, not mess around having cake and eating it. It might be OP's responsibility but that doesn't mean it's nice for her to grow up knowing these people are her biological parents and they're living this lifestyle because they didn't have her.", "OMG so much manipulation. I'm starting to think the bio parents should have chosen better people to adopt their child. \n\nAt least they would be thankful for the parents generosity", "Then i think the bio parents should do exactly that and not  pay for tuition", "Yeah posters in AITA have a tendency to ignore VERY important details so others will side with them.", "YTA \nIf you\u2019re calling bio-dad \u201cher dad,\u201d who are you to this girl? \n\nTheir offer is phenomenally gracious. Was your arrangement with him to raise the girl for a few years, then give her back? I am not seeing a clear line of caregiving. Which is bad for a child. Bad.", "YTA  HE gave you a CHILD!!! He has no power over your job or finances. It was up to you to provide for her, you have had 17 years to save and he offered 20% to help out. He has been a great friend and more than generous but you just take, take, take. And you should be happy his life has turned out well and he gets to travel and he is happy. Stop being so jealous. Your making your daughter bitter for no reason. You both should have thanked him for the dinner and the offer of $10,000 towards college! Who turns down 10 grand and whines its not enough, are you kidding?", "Absolutely. I feel very sorry for her. Op's attitude feels to me like \"we raised your kid for you\" rather than \"this our kid that you happen to make.\" Which would be super detrimental to her. It's nasty and insidious.", "Thank you \ud83d\ude2d he is an amazing guy and he's my best friend. I'm 27 and I text him every day. \ud83d\ude02 I  couldn't imagine taking help from him and being like okay that's it??"]}
