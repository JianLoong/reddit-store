Nancy came to my house yesterday evening and asked me if she and her baby can spend the days at my house during those hours??\n\nI said \"I'm sorry, but no, i work from home and I like the peace and quiet, I can't imagine being next to construction with a newborn baby, but I'm sorry Nancy you can't spend all your days here at my home\".

Very weird", "See, though, helping other people is MORE work for the entitled mom, who only felt comfortable bugging the woman working from home for \"nothing\" except \"a home base\" to run her life from for 6 months?\n\nThis lady wanted a babysitter. It was going to start small: \"can you watch the baby for a Second while I run to the store? I haven't had a chance all week!\"\n\nThat's why she didn't ask anyone else. Same reason religious families put the single adult woman at the kids' table. Implied free childcare. She wants her \"village\"", ">I am assuming maybe if the kid wanted to nap\n\nYou know when all babies, universally, nap? In a moving car.\n\nIf she's worried about the noise disturbing the baby, she can go for a drive.", "All babies except for me. I get carsick and would scream non stop if the car moved, once it stopped I was fine. My mom thought I was a brat until she figured it out.", "In Europe most babies nap in their prams, during strolling e.g. in the park.   \nCar rides are \"reserved\" for the evening colics ;).", "Take the baby to the library isn\u2019t it supposed to be quiet there?", "Both of my kids slept in the car, but it's much more hit and miss with my grandkids, much to my surprise.", "Thats odd, my son would freak out and start crying if we had to stop the car, but as long as it was constantly moving, he was happy and would quickly fall asleep.", "My first kid was just like this as a baby in the car - especially when the seat faced rear. And colicky 2a-4a every night for 5 months.", "Lmao. Same here with being carsick. But I also have malformed Eustachian tubes other parts of my inner ears so I\u2019m very sensitive to pressure changes, even as an adult-sometimes just opening and closing the doors makes my ears scream, traveling with just a bit of an elevation change is painful"]}
