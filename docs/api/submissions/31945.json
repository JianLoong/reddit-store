My neighbor Nancy from across the street still has a huge dirt lot next to her home. Nancy and husband Joe just had a baby about 3 months ago, and construction started about 1 month ago to build more homes . So there is a lot of noise Mon- Fri 7am to 4pm. Surprisingly the streets are very wide, and i don't really hear any of it on my side. I WFH 3 days a week. Nancy came to my house yesterday evening and asked me if she and her baby can spend the days at my house during those hours??\n\nI said \"I'm sorry, but no, i work from home and I like the peace and quiet, I can't imagine being next to construction with a newborn baby, but I'm sorry Nancy you can't spend all your days here at my home\". We only have 2 cats, no kids.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNancy said I was not being very neighborly a quite a bit of an ass. Said she didn't want to ask other neighbors because they were elderly, or single young guys, and did not want to bother them. but felt it was OKAY to bother me. HAHA the Audacity. I would literally never expect this of a neighbor, or make such a request ever. Maybe if it was an emergency for a day or two, but for 6 months??\n\nSo AITA??\n\nAnd just to add more detail, in the 8 months that we have lived here we have met once and waived to each other another time. So I don't really know this neighbor at all, which surprises me even more that she made this request of me.", "created_utc": 1701199568, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1864bwm/aita_for_refusing_my_neighbor_spends_her_weekdays/", "score": 188, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They get used to the noise if you let it in.  \n\nFor those with tiny kids or about to have them- silence does not equal sleeping. Some construction noise would actually be great to help the kiddo learn to sleep in anything and be a great sleeper.", "NTA. So, she wouldn't want to bother the guys, or the elderly couple, but it makes all kinds of sense to her to completely tank your work life for six months? I mean, what could YOU possibly doing that is so important?", "You are NTA.  Your neighbour is entitled thinking that your house could be her day sanctuary.  What did she expect moving into a developing subdivision.  Her problem and not yours to solve.", "NTA. What did Nancy expect moving into a new housing development? Did she think the adjacent lot would remain vacant? No, the developer wants to sell the lots and complete the development as soon as possible. \n\nNancy is a stranger to you. Let her stomp her foot and pout. You owe her nothing and if she decided to be a Gladys over it and complain to the other neighbors about it, you can tell them about her ridiculous request.", "NTA \n\nShe is quite presumptuous that just because she has a baby and you\u2019re neighbors she has the right to stay in your house. She can go to another friend\u2019s house, her parent\u2019s house, a movie, etc. I understand she may be at her final straw with noise, but putting this on you is not fair.", "NTA.  What an absurd request.", "Because you are married, you are a Safe bet.   \nBut no, not this shit, because if you do this, you are going to be that kids daycare. For life.   \n\n\nNTA", "NTA. The entitlement alone means having strong boundaries is important with this neighbor. You don\u2019t want her in your house", "NTA\nLemme guess you are a woman?

I can't imagine letting somebody just hang out at my house all day unless I knew them and knew they wouldn't disturb me.", "It was certainly better and smarter to not start what she wanted, than to try to stop it once she was doing it.", "NTA.

Good to shut her down. She will be the one neighbor who things she can do whatever she wants because everybody owes her.", "NTA. Oh lort! I hope this doesn't turn into an episode of \"my neighbor from hell\". The baby is going to be fine. When my kids were little we had train tracks right behind our house. The walls would shake.

How she thought that this was logical, reasonable or sane is beyond comprehension.\n\nNTA", "Nta. No means no. Nancy has some serious entitlement.", "NTA. When you move into a new development you have to expect it to be noisy. She doesn\u2019t get to disrupt your day because she doesn\u2019t like the noise. She\u2019s not being very neighbourly for trying to force you and her  baby on you while you\u2019re working. Besides, baby will get used to a noisy environment and will learn to sleep through just about anything.", "NTA. The next request was going to be can you watch the baby for a few. Since she needs so much peace and quiet, send her directions to the nearest library.", "NTA. What she was asking was an incredible imposition. Certainly not something to ask from a virtual stranger.", "NTA  Some of those elderly people might enjoy the company especially if she split it up between different people. She obviously has other options so she shouldn't ask someone she barely knows.", "NTA.  Wow, OP.  Your neighbors knew when they bought their home that there was a vacant lot next door to them & at some time in the near future, it was going to become UNVACANT.  The entitlement attitudes of some folks, especially strangers, blows me away.", "NTA\n\nShe asked you said no with a valid reason.\n\ntelling you you were not being neighbourly was out of order.", "It was okay of her to ask, but her calling you an ass is where she becomes the AH. You are NTA.", "NTA. But she is lonely and doesn't know who else to talk with, so she got her hopes up. Reality is hard though.", "Seems to me she is at the end of her teether with a new baby, who is now more mobile, and the noisy construction during the day is driving her to distraction. \nShe's so desperate for a bit of respite she asked you for the loan of your home having previously been nod a greeting only neighbors. \nOnce she gets a couple of hours shut eye at some point in the next 3 years she'll realise how ridiculous her perception of the world became having been sleep deprived for 3 solid months.\nNTA but you don't have to become enemies.", "NTA.
