Once you realized it was $700, you should have had a conversation with your nephew. He may only be 10, but it could've been a learning experience for him about the value of money. Instead, you made a promise, didn't fulfill it, and disappointed your nephew on his birthday.", "YTA, not for not buying a 700$ lego set but by not talking to your nephew in the two months that went by since the promise and then by buying a cheap thing at a truck stop instead of like, at least trying ?", "YTA. You got your nephew's hopes up, then forgot about his bloody birthday while he was so excited about your false promises, didn't communicate with anyone and then upset him on his birthday. \n\nDon't promise anything unless you are going to come through! \n\nFYI you're not TA for not spending crazy money on a present! But you said you would then messed about, had you communicated better you would be in the clear!", "YTA. While an $700 is unreasonable for a gift (but you could have split the cost with other guests though), there are much cheaper lego ninja sets (yeah, even for $20). Also getting toy ninja play set is a totally different thing than lego, and how could you ran out of time when you had 2 whole months to get him something?", "YTA once you learned the cost, you should have told your nephew that the set was too expensive but you\u2019d be willing to get a different set. You could even have told him the max you were willing to spend, or sent the names of some ninja stuff you could afford and let him choose from those.\n\nA while ago I told my 11-year-old nephew who collects postage stamps thst I\u2019d buy him a sheet of any of the new stamps at the USPS store, figurimg that they all cost the same (60 cents each). \n\nHe picked some stamps that turned out to cost $25 each! I told him in a polite way that was too much and he\u2019d have to pick from the regular stamps. He was fine with that, understood that $25 a stamp was a lot, and found other stamps that he was very happy with.", "YTA\n\nYou can't tell a kid that you're going to get them the thing they want more than anything, and then turn up and ruin their birthday with truck stop rubbish. I'm surprised you even need to ask the question.", ">He texted me a week later with the actual name and this thing was well over $700 with tax on Amazon.\n\n\n\nYour aren\u2019t the asshole for not buying that, it\u2019s crazy expensive for a 10 year old, but YTA for not telling him. If he\u2019s old enough to send you an Amazon link he\u2019s old enough for you to give him a budget. You could have fixed everything with one text to him, and if you felt uncomfortable saying it to the kid you could have easily told his mom.", "YTA. Would I spend $700 on a lego set? fuck no. But I don\u2019t make promises, especially to kids, to buy them something before I know what it is. Legos are expensive AF", "Why didn\u2019t you tell him that you wouldn\u2019t be able to get it for him?", "YTA for not correcting the promise when you saw the price.\n\nFor two months you let him build up the anticipation of getting this present. That\u2019s not okay.", "So YTA, but I get the feeling you don\u2019t have tons of experience with kids, not even your nephew. This can be a really good learning experience for you. Here are a couple of good takeaways:\n\n1) children are real people with the same feelings as anyone else. If you told your family members you wanted a 1967 Shelby GT 500 and they said \u201cno problem we\u2019re getting it for you!\u201d And showed up with a 2002 Toyota Camry and said \u201clook it\u2019s a car!!\u201d You\u2019d be pretty disappointed\n\n2) if your nephew asks you for a gift without his parents within earshot, always run it by them before committing. There may be a reason they haven\u2019t already gotten it for him. Parents don\u2019t say no to things their children want for \u201cno reason\u201d\n\n3) if you discovered after the fact that you weren\u2019t able to fulfil a promise to a child, either talk to them or their parent about it. Most children at the age of 10 have realized they can\u2019t get everything they want. If you had a real conversation with him and said \u201cbud, that Lego set is a little too expensive for right now\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s sold out and I can\u2019t get it\u201d you could have asked him if there was something else you could have gotten him and he\u2019d be pretty happy. If you\u2019re the \u201ccool uncle\u201d and afraid of having that conversation with him, you should have it with your sister so she can have it with him.\n\nNow I end this by saying, I am not a parent. But I have numerous children in my life and I always try to be \u201csuper cool aunt\u201d with presents and stuff. I\u2019ve learned a lot along the way, but I will bow to any contradictory advice given by any parent that wants to chime in here.\n\nAlso!! It\u2019s not too late to apologize and have that conversation with your nephew. Explain you\u2019re sorry you didn\u2019t get the set he wanted, that you didn\u2019t realize it would be out of your ability to get it, and maybe offer to make up for it by getting g him something else that you, he and his mom agree on.", "YTA. Promising a child something, not explaining that you won't be able to fulfill that promise and then not coming through is an AH move.\n\nJust had to deal with something similar but was handled in the right way. \n\nOn a facetime call with my mum in March, she asked my son what he wanted for his 8th birthday in early May. He said he wanted a very specific Bowser lego set that, unbeknownst to me and my mum, cost \u00a3200+. She told him that of course Nanny would get that for him. \n\n2 days later she messaged me a link to the cheapest place she found to buy it from and explained she could not afford it and gave me her budget. I was also horrified at the price.\n\nI spoke to son, explained how much that set cost and that we cant expect people to spend that much money on our Birthday gifts. I said he could give her a couple of options within her budget or she could give him an Amazon gift card to put towards the Bowser set he wanted.\n\nHe completely understood and said she could choose any Mario Lego set, an Amazon gift card or anything else she thought he would like.", "YTA.  Not die bc you didn\u2019t get the set, but bc you promised something and didn\u2019t deliver. It\u2019s your own fault for not researching how much it was going to cost before promising. \n\nYou ASSumed it wasn\u2019t that much. Well now you are the ASShole from that assumption.", "Almost 60 years ago my grandmother promised me a particular item for my birthday. In today's money, around \u00a315 and easy to finding shops.\n\n She bought me something totally different - and, of course, I was in trouble for not being grateful and quoting \"you shouldn't break your promises, even to children\". (It was a paint by numbers set - I'd have been thrilled with any design. Instead I was given a children's bible because I 'liked reading' ).\n\nYTA, OP. You got his hopes up, but did nothing to solve the problem. \n\n\nYTA", "YTA    you should have told him you couldn't get it, as soon as you realized it.", "YTA.\n\nNot for not buying the $700 set despite promising.  But you are one for sitting on this for about 7 weeks without saying anything to him or your sister and then half-assing a last minute gift.\n\nHe showed you what he wanted one week after you promised him which means you knew for 7 whole weeks you weren't going to get it for him.  You had 7 WEEKS to tell him \"Buddy, when I told you I would get it, I wasn't sure what it was and I didn't know how expensive it was.  I'm so sorry but I'm not going to be able to buy this for your birthday this year.  Is there anything else on your list?\"  Or you could have gone to your sister and asked for her help - \"I had no idea this was so expensive when I promised him - what should I do?\" where she could have suggested a different toy, worked on letting him down gently, etc.\n\nSo yeah, YTA for leading him on for two entire months.\n\nFor future reference, don't promise shit if you dont know what it is:\n\n**You**:  Hey nephew, what do you want for your birthday?\n\n**Him**: Blah blah blah toy\n\n**You**:  Oh, I don't know what that is.  Why don't we look it up online so you can show me?  \\*sees $1000 toy\\*  Oh wow, that's a really impressive toy.  I can see why you would want that, but it costs a lot of money.  What else is on your wishlist?", "Man, I was really on your side at first, but admitting to buying a cheap gift at a gas station when you have the funds for something nicer? I\u2019m not saying spend $700 on Legos, but YTA here.", "I\u2019m agreeing with everyone else - YTA.  But, you have a fairly serious problem beyond just being TA.  \n\nYou have not only greatly disappointed your nephew but you\u2019ve made an indelible impression that: \n1.

He wasn\u2019t important enough for you to even try to get him a good birthday present (seriously\u2026a gas station present?!?).\n\nThese realizations will hurt you going forward if you want a good relationship with your nephew.\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone here believes you should have bought a $700 Lego set but you didn\u2019t even try to correct the matter once you realized - it\u2019s a really sad (almost cruel) matter to let him think he was getting it for two months!  \n\nTwo months in \u201clittle boy time\u201d is a very, very long time.", "YTA\n\nhere\u2019s what you could have done way before his birthday. \n\nYou: Hey buddy.

But this should teach you not to make promises you can't keep as well. Always, always do your homework first before making any promises.", "YTA. Yes, $700 is crazy,  and as others have said you should have reset expectations with your nephew and sister once you found the price. But what gets me is that you then forgot and bought him a gift at a gas station, are you kidding me!?", "YTA. Bro, I understand 700 is too much, but a 20 dollar one from a gas station is a bit messed up. You know this already. You're lucky he's a kid, talk to his mom and figure out a new present and he'll forget about this previous fk up quite fast.", "YTA and your sister explained it well why, take it to heart.", "As others say.\n\nNTA, on the money issue.\n\nYTA because you forgot to try contacting your sister, or Nephew about it over a 2 month course. I get that life gets busy, but it feels like maybe you could have made it a point to contact your sister after your Nephew sent the picture/price of the set.\n\nI think its clear though, in the future, you need to tell your sister or Nephew that you\u2019ll get something as long as it isnt over x amount of dollars, or you are willing to pitch in x amount of dollars to a much bigger gift.

It\u2019s the moms job to smooth that over with him and teach him to be thankful and appreciative of gifts and kind gestures by others. \n\nNow, you should have told your nephew that you weren\u2019t buying the Lego set after you saw it was $700.

I said sure before doing my research and was unpleasantly surprised to find that this particular set went for $500. I immediately pivoted, took my son aside, and explained the situation. While he was disappointed, we talked about alternatives and other sets that were in a more reasonable price range, like $80-$100. The alternative set ended up being one of his favorites.

They are also the most expensive and they hate their competition and spend more times sending their lawyers after everyone who talks bad about em or also sells similar products.  \n\n\nThere is a german youtube channel (Held der Steine) who has a small store and used youtube to promote sets, was a lego partner and everything.   \n\n\nHe went from being exclusively lego  ( he was also a lego partner) to now still selling it as some customers still want it, still reviewing some older sets which he actually liked, to pretty much hating everything new lego does as you barely get shit for your money, how expensive it has become, how you can get sets 3 times the amount for the same price from other company's. How the quality has dropped. How lego still barely does prints and rather puts in cheap stickers.  \n\n\nOf course everyone still knows and remembers Lego.

Up until last year I had no idea how much Lego was worth.", "Well, I guess that explains why it's so pricey.", "It\u2019s available on Amazon. It\u2019s on sale from $700 to $665. A 10 year old would absolutely ask for a Ninjago set that\u2019s retired, especially if it\u2019s still available for purchase.", "Yes. And it might also explain why OP is full of shit with his story. Chances that a 10yo kid is asking for a retired set like it\u2019s a totally reasonable thing are very slim. Any kid who would be *that* into Lego would also know to tell their uncle not to look for it on Amazon.\n\nImma guess your knowledge of Lego is\u2026not that deep?"]}
