Now, we know customers compare our prices to online. We are not ignorant to that. But he does he it so blatantly right in front of us. He always makes snide remarks about our prices. He has also often commented on our online pages, along with other nearby stores, complaining about our prices, annoyed at the fact that we don't do them for RRP. We are in fact well below RRP.

This time, I apologised to him and I told him I will sell it to him at the RRP. I just told him to give me a second while I figured out exactly what it should be. I open up the website for our supplier and searched for the Pop. The RRP, according to our supplier, was 17.51. So I told him that would be 17.51. He seemed bemused at the fact that it was more expensive, so I showed him the page on the suppliers website to prove it. I said our prices are 12.99 but if you want them at RRP, then that will be 17.51. He said RRP prices should be what they are online. I said online prices don't dictate what the RRP is and will always be able to be cheaper. I told them if he wants to purchase the item, it will be 17.51. He predictably didn't buy it (he never does) and left the store.\n\nI was telling some family about the situation and my brother stated that I shouldn't have been so blunt with a customer.
