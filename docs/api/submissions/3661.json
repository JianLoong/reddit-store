Being divorced that many times is a red flag in itself besides this obvious one.", "NTA. This is a hill to die on. You should just get your daughter and leave. He will never treat her as an equal daughter. The wedding plan is only the beginning of his leaving her out. You owe your daughter better than him.\n\nThere is a reading he is divorced twice. \n\nYWBTA big time if you go through with this wedding. All you will end up being is his 3rd ex wife.", "NTA. But he\u2019s made a promise to someone about this and it\u2019s not you.", "Ffs op, do not marry this man and put your child first, I would set this world on fire for my kids and no partner would tell me otherwise, he is talking absolute shit, nta for now but stay and you won't be", "Am I the only one that\u2019s skeeved out by the fact that he knocked up 2 ex\u2019s at the same time? That means he has indiscriminate and unprotected sex. I put good money that you\u2019re not only gonna end up divorced if you marry him, but you\u2019ll probably also end up with an STD. This is marinara with meatballs, babe.", "These are marinara flags if I\u2019ve ever seen them \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nHe got two women pregnant as almost the same time \ud83d\udea9\n\nHe is refusing to let your daughter be a flower girl although she is in-between the ages of his daughter who are all flower girls \ud83d\udea9\n\nHe is gaslighting you into thinking you\u2019re unreasonable for wanting the same for your daughter \ud83d\udea9\n\nHe won\u2019t give you an explanation for not wanting your daughter as a flower girl \ud83d\udea9\n\nHe claims to treat all the kids the same when he clearly isn\u2019t \ud83d\udea9\n\nRun. \n\nNTA.", "NTA Unless you marry him and let him to continue this mistreatment of you and your daughter. He's Mr Red Flag.", "So. Many. Red flags. GET OUT.", "Seriously, the flower girls are part of the bridal party, not grooms, so he shouldn\u2019t be picking them anyways", "He got his 2 ex wives pregnant at the same time. That should be big red flag", "Yeah, the fianc\u00e9 part needs fixing", "Came here to say this!", "I could not upvote this enough. op please protect your daughter from him.", "In terms of cheating, he admitted he made a mistake and regretted it. He got therapy and then divorced his 2nd wife but they share custody. I just don't know what to feel about this anymore..admittedly, I feel like I rushed into this relationship but I thought it was because we had some much in common. Besides the kids get along pretty well.", "Based purely on my podcast listening experience I would say he's been juggling a couple of main squeezes and chasing after one night stands during the whole time she's known him.  Just a guess of course but it would fit the evidence we have.", "THIS.", "Why die on this hill? Do you really wanna win? Cause he\u2019s suddenly gonna never try to pull this in the future?\n\nJust walk away from the hill, let him all alone on it, and go chill with your daughter on a beach somewhere with a margarita.", "Yeah the flower girls are traditionally part of the bridal party (assuming op is a woman). There's no reason why it's his decision alone.\n\nI get the feeling he's controlling in general. OP would you say this is the case?", "You would still marry this asshole?", "I don't know how this got to this point. We were arguing about a spot for my daughter to be a flower girl and somehow...somehow I'm treating the kids differently? Like what?.? My head hurts and I feel like I'm spinning.", "[deleted]", "If you really want to marry this guy ( which I hope you don\u2019t) make your daughter a bridesmaid or jr. bride. ..", "OP do you HEAR YOURSELF????", "He\u2019s already gaslighting you, your child, and is pretty much saying she can\u2019t be a part of your life together. That\u2019s enough to not go ahead with the wedding.\n\nThe second you say, \u201cactually, I want to halt the wedding\u201d, you\u2019ll be met with so much eye-opening things that may be best to hear now than years later  when you\u2019re pregnant and tied to this man for eternity.", "How long were you together before you got engaged? Who cares for the kids when you're all together? Who's making dinner and cleaning up the house?", "Yess he sounds like a big red flag", "Oh no I would just want his reaction to what I proposed above then cuss him out and leave him", "He got two women pregnant at the same time and this is the dude you want to marry?\n\nMarry some self esteem and save your daughter the therapy", ">My head hurts and I feel like I'm spinning\n\nThat is what gaslighting does to you. he is trying to make you think you are feeling ways you aren't so your body is reacting.", "This is an absolute example of gaslighting, and he is doing it knowingly and deliberately. You haven't said how long you have been together, but given his previous relationships and timelines, it can't be more than a couple of years.\n\nThe 'honeymoon phase' of your relationship can't be far from over, and now he is showing you who he truly is.\n\nHe hasn't learned *anything* from his two failed marriages, and doesn't value you or your child. Don't make the biggest mistake of your life - walk away NOW.", "This sounds like classic DARVO and it's a bad sign. NTA and reconsider.", "Why is this even an argument though? His actions show he only cares about his kids, protect your own and leave.", "Understandably!  Did he eve show other signs? When\u2019s the wedding set to be?", "Think of whats best for your daughter. Actions are louder then words. What he says and what he does are two different worlds. Your daughter will forever resent YOU. If she is going to be treated as an outsider before the marriage.. how will she be treated afterwards?", "Don\u2019t marry him, he will just treat your daughter like a outcast when you are married."]}
