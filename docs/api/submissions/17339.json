She got upset and said she doesn\u2019t like it when I say no to her. \nI told her (as calmly, non aggressive and playful as i could) I\u2019m allowed to say no.

I asked her if she was serious and she told me \u201cyes, I\u2019m over it. I can\u2019t be with someone like you. Can\u2019t even feed you\u201d. \nI hate games like this, so I booked the hotel. \nShe then told me she\u2019s getting on a different flight. So when it came time to check into my flight, i asked her multiple times to come with me. She either ignored me or told me it\u2019s no use. \nSo I checked in, dropped off my bags and went through security. \n\nNow, not even 10 minutes ago she messaged me asking where i am. I told her the truth, I\u2019m past security. She flipped out calling me heartless, that I never cared about her and how I\u2019m not a real man. \n\nI\u2019m at my wits end. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done anything wrong? \nShe told me it\u2019s not about the rice, but how I replied to her, how I\u2019m all \u201cego\u201d. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s egotistical to not want my partner to talk to me like crap.. \n\nTldr; partner was angry and told me that she bought a ticket for another flight, so I didn\u2019t wait for her and went through security.\n\nUpdate. So, turns out she didn\u2019t leave the airport.

She definitely needs to work on how she acts in relationships, and accept that she can be wrong as well. It sounds like she has a lot of pride she isn't able to let go of. If the goal is staying together then couples therapy would be a recommendation. Someone to mediate while you work on improving communication together. If you're not set on staying together, the answer is simple.\nI would encourage her to seek out some professional resources regardless to help her with those feelings of anger/fear as it feels like her reaction is rooted in one of those emotions. It is not right for her to take her emotions out on you, and you need to put your mental health and wellbeing first. We can't control others, only ourselves. \n\nStay well everyone \nXx", "Nta.

There is something so wrong with her and you are caught up in it. If you have to tip-toe around her, like worrying to speak calmly about something as simple as saying no to more food, she is into head games, is a narcissist, or both.

I personally hate being fed or when people shove food in my face and my partner respects that and will ask if I want to try something instead of losing their marbles over something like that.
