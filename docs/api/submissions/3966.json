We don\u2019t have kids or animals to care for so this would be a great time to experience new family things together. I really would like to include her and if she\u2019s not able to come as you know our finances I must respectfully decline until a time we all can afford it.\u201d", "YTA and if you were my husband, I\u2019d look long and hard about if I want to stay. Your parents are ALSO big AH. Who are you married to, your parents or your wife? Frankly, I hope your wife leaves you.", "So what happens if y'all have a kid?  Are your parents not going to pay for them as well since they \"wouldn't be their kid\" and then you'll leave them behind as well or would they pay for you and your kid but not your wife, cause you know she's just the mother of your child not their child. \n\n\n\nI'm gonna say YTA.", "YTA. Save up and take your wife on the \"once in a lifetime\" trip next winter. Your parents are being assholes, I've never heard of spouses being excluded when someone is paying for the rest of the family, that's insane. What happens when you have kids? Your parents pay for your kids because they're blood relatives and your wife has to pay for herself or stay home?", "YTA. You wife was fully excluded on purpose! Your parents knew full well that you wouldn't be able to pull this trip off for your wife and you still have no issue going on the trip. \n\nYou are a spoiled brat. You need to grow up.", "I'm going to go against the masses and say NTA. But you are young and maybe aren't ready for marriage.  Your parents aren't obligated to pay for your wife and they're also not obligated to pay for you. You're an adult. But you're also married. If it were ME,  I'd do what it takes to make sure your wife can go on the trip. Even if it means you both take shitty weekend temp jobs to pay for her fare. If it's really a \"once in a lifetime trip,\" then it seems you'd want her to also have the experience. Be warned,  if you leave her at home,  she may decide to move on.  Maybe you're just not ready for a partnership. It's your choice, but I'm sure it will have consequences regardless. Make your decision.", "NTA. She isn\u2019t entitled to their money. Your parents get to choose who they spend their money on. If you want to go then go and tell your wife she is acting like a baby.", "YTA\n\nIf you all went out to dinner and your parents paid for you , would they expect your wife to pay for her meal?\nIf your wife comes does she pay for everything for herself and you nothing?\n\nIt would be one thing if they said, we would love for the 2 of you to come and we will pay blank amount to help the two of you as a couple with the expenses and the rest is on you, we also understand if you don\u2019t have the funds.\n\nDo you have unlimited vacation time or would you be taking days off and not enough time when you and your wife want to do things?", "Your parents don\u2019t seem to view your wife as family.", "YTA. You are allowing your parents to treat your wife as \u201cless than\u201d, and not a full member of the family.", "NTA. No one is entitled to a free trip. It would be a different story if they were paying for your siblings spouses and not your wife. But that doesn't sound like the case. Sounds like they want to make up for lost time with their children.", "YTA\nYour wife is your nuclear family now", "YTA. How do you even have to ask? Is this trip more important to you than your wife? Because it sounds like it. Why are you letting your parents exclude your wife all the time when they know y\u2019all can\u2019t afford it. You need to set some boundaries with your family asap. It\u2019s hurting your wife and you are oblivious to it. Damn, man.", "YTA while your parents aren\u2019t under obligation to pay for her, but I really couldn\u2019t imagine being ok accepting things that were not offered to my partner.", "YTA.  I hope this is a wake up call for your wife to finally see how you REALLY feel about her and leave your sorry a**.  Again,  YTA.", "YTA - Your parents are too.  It would be different if they couldn\u2019t afford it, but you admit that they can.  As a parent of grown kids, we treat our kids and their partners equally for purposes is vacations.", "Yta if you go on this trip without your wife. Either your parents pay for both, or you stay home with her. Yes it might make your parents sad, but going without your wife will make her more sad and honestly might cause long term damage to your marriage. Do the right thing OP.", "Is there a possible reason your parents dislike your partner? Because that's what it sounds like.  We don't know if she's insufferable or if its something in your parents head.  Either way,  it sounds like you need to choose a side.", "You need to stand up to your parents. Tell them your wife is part of the family and needs to be included, too. Let them know that if they don\u2019t include her, they don\u2019t need to include you. What will they do if you have children? Include you and the kids, but leave your wife out. You need to end this. That is so weird that your wife has a separate ticket when you go to a restaurant. Step up and be your wife\u2019s husband. yTA", "YTA. My MIL did this to me twice. She also got mad because my husband said he wasn\u2019t going if I wasn\u2019t going. \n\nYour wife isn\u2019t welcome and she knows she isn\u2019t. A better solution would be for y\u2019all to save money and go together. Without your family.", "A whole family of assholes. If you let your wife read this: \n\nSet some boundaries right now with your asshole husband.", ">thought she would be supportive of me going, but she's very upset and hurt.\n\n>still have time to cancel on my parents, but I know they would be sad.\n\nSo it's cool if your wife is hurt and sad, but not your parents? Why do their feelings matter more than your wife's? \n\nYTA and so are your parents, tbh. They are purposely excluding your wife from family trips, and you're allowing it to happen.", "YTA - I would never go on a family vacation without ALL of my family - and that starts with my husband.  That\u2019s the whole thing with marriage - you become each other\u2019s family.  And you are ditching her at the holidays on top of that\u2026.if you don\u2019t start respecting your wife you won\u2019t have a marriage very long.", "NTA, for wanting to go, but take your wife and don't do Christmas gifts. We opt for experiences with our grown kids and don't exchange gifts. It makes the holiday much less stressful, and we get experiences together we'll always remember.\n\nIf your parents are \"extremely comfortable\" now, why are they sending this message to your wife? Think about that.", "What...the...fuck...YES, of course YTA and so are your parents. Are you seriously even asking? Imagine if her parents did this to you.", "YTA. Your wife is soon going to be excluding you from her life.", "YTA. Are you kidding? \u201cOnce in a lifetime\u201d is supposed to happen with the person who you\u2019re spending your life with. \n\n\u201cThis has always bothered my wife\u201d\nWHY isn\u2019t it bothering you? \n\nFamily trips include the entire family.

The day after Christmas??", "YTA. And your parents are also assholes. She is your WIFE. That means she is family. Them not including her is mean and meant to make her feel like an outsider\n\nThis is not a once in a lifetime trip. You can go on other ski trips. You going w/o your wife is telling her she doesn't matter. She has every right to be upset. You are selfish and mean, just like your parents. A good spouse would've put his foot down the very first time they tried to nickel and dime her. Grow a pair and stand up to your parents\n\nYou can count on destroying your marriage if you go on this trip without her. Same if you scrape up money to take her too. They need to pay for everyone, or pay for no one", "YTA.  I don't think you're a complete monster or anything, but I know there is no way in HELL that I would go on that trip.  Especially when you know full well that they are deliberately excluding her.\n\nYou and her are a package.  \"Sorry, we can't afford it.\"  If your parents don't like it, well, that's how it is.  Don't let them buy a wedge between you and your wife.", "YTA. Your parents are completely disrespecting your wife and your marriage and you are going along with it. \n\nIf your parents really thought it is only fair for them to pay for you for things they are paying for your siblings they would say \u201cWe paid X for your siblings, we\u2019ll pay X towards you and your wife and the two of you can pay the difference.\u201d That approach would let your parents feel they are \u201cfair\u201d between you and your siblings while recognizing the fact you have started your own family with your wife. Instead they tell you \u201cWe are only paying for you, that other person is of no importance and can fend for themselves.\u201d", "YTA why aren\u2019t you both paying for your wife to go? You should be wanting her to go and pay for her too, basically make it so your parents are paying half of what it takes for you both. You\u2019re selfish too", "YTA-you don\u2019t want to upset the people who are purposefully excluding your wife. You don\u2019t care that she\u2019s sad. Time to cut the cord with the parents and stand up for your wife-before she gets fed up and leaves you.", "YTA\n\nuse a credit card so you can both go. You\u2019re married now. It\u2019s a once in a life time trip for BOTH of you.", "YTA. You left home and made a new family with your wife. Get your priorities straight.", ">They could certainly afford to pay for my wife to also go, but they have always been this way when it comes to paying for things for me versus my wife.\n\nYTA for accepting the gift under these conditions. Your parents are intentionally excluding your wife. They know you cannot afford to pay her way. \n\nA ski trip isn't a once in a lifetime trip. Save up and go on that trip one day in the future with your wife.", "YTA. \n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if you go on this trip, if you come home and find you no longer have a wife.", "You and your parents are AHs.  My ex\u2019s parents treated me like your wife and I walked.  It\u2019s not okay\u2026they know exactly what they\u2019re doing and how wrong it is.  You have two choice:  support your wife and show your parents that your allegiance is with your wife or go on your trip and isolate your wife and see how that works out for you.", "I hope your wife does not have children with you. YTA.", "YTA. Your parents are using this trip (and the dinners) as a way to tell your wife that she is not family, in their eyes. They're being shitty to the woman you love, and you're letting them.", "YTA. Your wife is your family now and you are the one letting your parents exclude her. If they really can afford to pay for her you need to put your foot down and either stay home or tell your parents you\u2019ll go if they include her. Your wife has a right to be pissed.", "Could they pay for her now, and you pay them back over time?

I would never go without my wife, its us or nothing.\n\n\n\nYTA", "\"See honey, Reddit says I'm N T A!\"", "This**** 100% idk what this guy thinks is going to happen if reddit thinks he's NTA. He's still going to have to deal with his wife and no matter what we think SHE thinks he's the AH lol. Her opinion is all that matters.", "I can\u2019t believe you accept this and condone them excluding your wife. I would be super pissed also if my husband left me alone to go with his parents who excluded me. It would be one thing if they couldn\u2019t afford it but they can. This is totally unacceptable and apparently they don\u2019t feel like she\u2019s family. YTA also your parents are AH\u2019s too.", "Exactly!! Also\u2026 she\u2019s your WIFE\u2026 part of the family or should be anyway\u2026 not some random girlfriend\u2026 sheesh!", "Yep totally agree.  If him & his wife can't afford to pay to go, then neither should be going.   Sounds like his parents are continually undermining the relationship and he is allowing it.\n\nYTA OP", "No, it IS time to cut the cord. Grow up and be a man. YTA", "They've always just said it's because I am their child. I honestly didn't think much of it when my wife and I were just dating, but I did expect it to change after we got married.", "Exactly. They are actively using money to exclude her and op can only think of himself", "Yep, trashy, ill-mannered parents, and apple didn't fall far from the tree. Hope the wife packs up and RUNS from this toxic mess while they're all on their \"once-in-a-lifetime\" trip.", "Right?! \n\nHow is he even asking???", "This. This \ud83d\udcaf", "Lol what? Just because you are married doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t go on vacation with your parents. However, what it should mean is your spouse is the most important person to you, and if they are not happy to miss out you\u2019ll prioritise them.", "But if she\u2019s the only one having to pay them back, when the parents are so financially comfortable that they don\u2019t even need her to, then they are still going out of their way to exclude her. OP needs to stand up for *his wife* and draw a boundary with his parents: if they won\u2019t include her in family events/trips, then he won\u2019t be participating either.", "I mean\u2026my partner and I both take trips independently of each other with friends once in awhile. But this is totally different. I would be so hurt if I were her.", "Somewhere a divorce lawyer is laughing maniacally while writing an invoice after reading this post.", "He\u2019s going to go on this trip without her and was hoping Reddit coming to his rescue would be able to cloud his guilty conscience- but have a feeling this would have backfired", "Are they going to pay for you and your kids later but still exclude your wife? They treat her like crap but you are fine as long as you get to go skiing? Not cool.", "I would divorce you over this and I\u2019m not being dramatic, because all this says is you care about you first, your family second and your wife third.  \n\nYour message to your parents is we are a package deal.  Outside of a boys trip or something any vacation you go on is with your wife.  This is a family vacation and your family includes your wife.  Your parents are totally within their rights not to pay but you are not as a married man who wants to stay married.  You can view it as okay half my trip is paid for and if I want to go we have to come up with the other half or let\u2019s not go.  The fact that you are even considering going (especially so close to the holidays) makes you such an asshole.\n\nWhat if the trip was planned on your wife\u2019s birthday.  What if your parents paid for your siblings significant other.  At what point do they cross a line that you realize how terrible they are treating your wife?\n\nAnd you being more concerned about your parents being sad than your wife is the cherry on the top of the YTA cake.", "Yes, but your *wife* is now connected to *you* in a significant way. To continually exclude her and to continually put you in a position where you have to choose between her and them is unfair and completely wrong. She is a part of your family and needs to be treated as such.", "When we go out to eat and on vacation we pay for our sons girlfriends and now one is a wife. We have NEVER excluded them. Heck we even paid when they had friends over when young. If we we're struggling financially we tried to budget. \nWow such clear YTA to me. The wife is family. I don't know why you would even think about going without her. I hope she doesn't exclude you and your family soon.", "And now that it hasn't changed why haven't you put your foot down? Are all these trips worth your marriage?", "Have you discussed it with your parents?  If not, then your blind acceptance of the situation is what makes YTA. You should be your wife\u2019s advocate for being treated better", "That\u2019s all fine - you can\u2019t control their choices or how they spend their money.

Have you ever asked for it to change?", "I encourage you to continue going on these trips so your wife can be shown, repeatedly, that your family doesn\u2019t see you both as a package deal and that you do not in any way have her back. Hopefully during one of these trips she takes the hint, packs up, and leaves. \n\nSo, yes. You should absolutely go on this trip and every other one your parents exclude your wife from. The kindest thing you can do is let her find someone who actually cares about her. \n\nYTA.", "I would be careful about taking advice on here, because this sub is notoriously biased against men. Next time don\u2019t add your gender.

We can afford it and our adult kiddo is just starting out. This is weird", "Oh, please. If OP was a *woman* who was totally fine with leaving her *husband* behind because her parents repeatedly and intentionally excluded him from family events and trips, my judgement would still be a big ol\u2019 **YTA.** Treating spouses like outsiders and pretending they\u2019re not a part of your family is *always* an AH move."]}
