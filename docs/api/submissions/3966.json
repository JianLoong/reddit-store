If they did come, they had to pay their own way since he wanted it to be a boys trip. I could not afford to go to Las Vegas, especially short notice.

If you cannot afford to cover the whole bill every time then you do that only when you want/can and the other times you make it clear that you'll be splitting the bill, but if you decide to offer it's the whole table. That said, even for the trip if the parents really wanted to include the wife some kind of arrangement could be found without problems, especially if they're so well off as they say. They could say \"we're willing to cover x amount for the both of you, if you can't afford to pay the rest now because it's Christmas and you have a lot of expenses we can lend you the money and you'll pay us back when you can\".

That's SO SHITTY, and horrifically rude.

What about when your siblings get married? Won't their spouses be part of the family? I get they may not want to pay for everyone.  That is their right as gift givers.

The room was a tiny romantic cabin that had a hot tub in it and fire place in it, 200 bucks for passes, used gear we bought ( I bought boots , bonding board for like 100). We drove.  Think total was 500-600 with food and clothes. Plus with the love of my life. I rather have a cheap romantic vacation with him then a expensive alone with family without.

This will bring her many feelings as she realizes how much you care about her.\n\nI would facetime her from the best view, with my mom and dad, and take lots of group photos making funny faces and hand signs and stuff.

They even used to talk about setting up her husband on dates right in front of her. Total assholes. Needless to say, my friend is now happily divorced.", "Exactly, what I think. This is how it should have been phrased by the parents or at least how OP should think of this situation even if parents didn\u2019t phrase it like this.

But \"we can't afford it\" -> \"so she can't go, but I can\" doesn't fit right when a couple lives together and especially when they are married too when it comes to a family vacation. \n\nOP should consider this as: *My parents contribute to us being able to join the big family vacation with 50% of our costs.
