If they did come, they had to pay their own way since he wanted it to be a boys trip. I could not afford to go to Las Vegas, especially short notice.

Once you married your wife, she became part of your family. If you had taken this attitude with your family from the get-go, that you and your wife are a family unit and you wouldn\u2019t put up with her being excluded, they\u2019d probably be paying for both of you now. So YTA for putting up with you\u2019re family\u2019s attitude and YWBTA if you go on this trip without your wife and leave her alone at Christmas because you can\u2019t afford for both of you to go on this vacation.

That\u2019s literally the only thing that I can think of to cover your a$$. \n\nWhy not her gifts? BECAUSE YOU WERE SELFISH (and entirely lacking in empathy, to boot)!!!! You as good as told her that she means so little to you that you will dip out the day after Christmas, leave her alone, travel with your family on a once in a lifetime trip (your words), and are absolutely fine with the way she\u2019s been treated by your family. Your family knows EXACTLY what they\u2019re doing, and, at this point, it won\u2019t change because you\u2019ve been going along with it the whole time! How would you feel if the tables were turned? Surely you wouldn\u2019t be jealous or upset AT ALL if she got the trip of a lifetime while you got to\u2026sit at home and be excluded over the holidays.\n\nI can only assume at this point that you\u2019re tired of being married and want a divorce without putting extra effort in on your end.

Literally, the only way forward without facing marital ruin is to say, \u201cHoney, would you mind returning my gifts this year? I really appreciate all the effort you put in; however, the best Christmas gift I can think of is to have you beside me on this trip together. I can\u2019t wait to have this experience with you, and nothing matters more than being together at Christmas.

After this trip, I will have a conversation with my parents about their treatment of you, our boundaries as a couple, and stress to them that we are a united front. I apologize again for the way I\u2019ve behaved and just want you to know how much I love you.\u201d May god have mercy on your soul because I truly can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re oblivious, stupid, or entirely indifferent.
