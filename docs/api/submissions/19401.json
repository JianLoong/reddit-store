We toured a few this spring and plan to tour several out of state ones throughout the summer. The plan was for myself, my husband, and his father to do the tours together. We\u2019ll be touring 4 schools, and he\u2019s coming to 3 of them. \n\nSome background: my son\u2019s father and I split up before our son was 6 months old. Soon after our relationship ended, I met my now husband and we got married when son was 3. My ex has been supportive of our relationship and thinks my husband is a great stepfather. Our coparenting relationship has been challenging at times but we\u2019ve done just fine for the sake of our son. Last year, my ex eloped with this woman, Shelly (not her real name). They dated for only a year or so before marrying. I don\u2019t know her too well since we\u2019ve only met twice but I know she has three kids of her own, her oldest is about the same age as my son. My son dislikes her. He thinks Shelly is mentally unhinged, is way too involved in his personal business, and he blames her for being the reason he hasn\u2019t been able to spend as much quality time with his father lately.\n\nEarlier this week, I was coordinating with my ex about the details of our next tour. Everything was great until he mentioned that Shelly would be coming along on all our tours. I asked why and if it was necessary that she tag along. He said that she just wanted to be supportive. I asked him if her daughter was looking at these schools too, since she\u2019s also going to be a senior, and he said no. So why is she coming if her own child isn\u2019t planning on attending those schools? I told him that our son should get a say in who comes to the tours and that I would ask him what he thought about Shelly joining us. After I got off the phone with my ex, I asked our son if he wanted Shelly to come with us. He immediately replied no and that he wasn\u2019t comfortable with her coming.  I told our son that he should speak with his father and let him know about what he thinks. \n\nFast forward to last night, my ex calls and is furious that I would \u201cget our son involved in this matter.\u201d I replied that our son is the one touring the colleges and making decisions about his future, and he gets to decide who can come along. Not to mention, our son is almost an adult and at his age is more than capable of deciding who he wants in his life and to what extent. Son has been vocal to his father about his feelings about Shelly. He accepts that his father loves her but he doesn\u2019t see her as family. So I told my ex that if he loves his son and wants to continue having a positive relationship with him, then he needs to respect his wishes and leave his wife at home. End of story. Ex replies that I\u2019m an AH, Shelly cares about our son, and that he should be allowed to bring his wife with him whenever he chooses. \n\nWas I wrong?

If your ex is more concerned about Shelly's feelings than his son's then maybe he should stay home with her.", "NTA\n\nYou are correct that your son should have a say in the matter. Ex-husband needs to realize this is about his son, not about his new wife.", "NTA. Shelly hasn't been in your son's life long enough to have any impact on his college choices. There's no reason for her to be there stressing him out while he's beginning to make decisions about his adult life.", "NTA- I'd just tell him one last time- dude- you are making your son super unhappy. If she actually cares about him, then she should respect his wishes and boundaries. The fact that she refuses says that this is about her, not him. Respecting your son's wishes does not make me an A.H. You cramming your wife, who already needles him, down his throat makes you the AH. Just remember we had this conversation in a few years when you come to me asking me why he won't speak to you anymore.", "NTA Your son has the final say here. But honestly, your Ex- needs to hear himself. \n\nIf Shelly cared about your son, Son should never have to say that he wants one-on-one time with his dad. Shelly should be telling Ex-, hey you need to make sure that just cuz we're married and there are 3 more kids in the house that you aren't skipping time with just son. Shelly should be saying- if Son wants me on these college visits awesome but I'm fine staying home.\n\nThese college tours aren't a family bonding experience for Ex-, Shelly and Son and they aren't a chance for a romantic weekend away for Shelly and Ex-. They're about Son seeing where he might want to spend the next 4 years of his life.", "NTA. Your son should get to decide. \n\nHowever, he shouldn\u2019t blame Shelly for his father\u2019s choice to spend less time with him.\n\nCompletely fair to dislike Shelly for pushing into his personal life, though.", "NTA. This is another case of a parent trying to shove a step-parent down his poor child's throat.  Your ex has no concern at all for his son. He and his mama wannabe should both stay home because, if poor little wife doesn't get her way, he'll be making the trip all about her hurt feelings.\n\nIt's a pity your son's father doesn't care about him. Please don't let him ruin this milestone for your son.", "Your ex needa to grow the fuck up, he has a child, the time to stop acting like a child himself was the second he became a father.

Just choose 1 for each tour (and leave Shelly out of it since son doesn't like her)", "NTA\n\nNo student needs four \"parents\" with them on their college tour.  Shelly will most likely be bored and make everyone else miserable.  I recommend you make future college visits without your son's Dad or his wife.\n\nAlso, have you discussed/arranged the split of college costs with your Ex yet?  It's possible that Shelly could cause trouble when it comes to paying for college, especially if she thinks her kid(s) deserve your Ex's support too or if she seems your son's college to be too expensive.  If you don't already have clear plans regarding your son's college expenses, you might want to discuss this with your Family Attorney.  In some states that favor college support from divorced parents, the filing for amended support orders could possibly need to be filed before the student turns 18.", "NTA - Shelly can stay home and be nutty alone.", "NTA. Your son is old enough to say he doesn\u2019t want to be around someone. Also, his dad is risking seeing much less of his son once he is an adult if he forces him to spend time with a step mother he doesn\u2019t care for. He\u2019s practically an adult already. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s seeing this woman as an additional parent. She is his dad\u2019s choice, not your son\u2019s. He had no input on who his dad married. That\u2019s fair enough, I guess. Perhaps his dad shouldn\u2019t have input on who joins his tours.", "NTA you're the only parent who actually cares about your son.\n\nHe won't forget it", "You husband should stay at home too then as he is not his father.", "Tell her is she pays half if she wants to be supportive.", "I was ready to say yea you were when I saw your husband was going but NTA if your son doesn\u2019t want her there, especially when it seems like she interferes with his time with his father.

For your sons sake you should try to smooth that relationship, her coming to the colleges could be a good bonding experience, and as your husband is there it does make sense.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like the latter. It\u2019s clear you don\u2019t like her.\n\nCoparenting with exes is hard. When you have a challenging interaction, I\u2019d encourage pausing to sleep on it before acting. If you feel your son is incapable of speaking up to his dad, this would\u2019ve been an opportunity to have a conversation the next day where you, he, and your dad ask if he\u2019d like it to be just his parents or he\u2019s okay with one or both of your partners coming, too? That way you could show him how to handle such situations and help him as a soon-to-be adult learn to find his voice.

My husband (son\u2019s stepdad) isn\u2019t going to one of them because of a business trip and might have to bail on another one.

I\u2019ve been completely neutral about Shelly around my son so I\u2019m not stirring things up between anyone. If anything, I\u2019ve been the one trying to smooth things over.
