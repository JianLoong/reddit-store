We toured a few this spring and plan to tour several out of state ones throughout the summer. The plan was for myself, my husband, and his father to do the tours together. We\u2019ll be touring 4 schools, and he\u2019s coming to 3 of them. \n\nSome background: my son\u2019s father and I split up before our son was 6 months old. Soon after our relationship ended, I met my now husband and we got married when son was 3. My ex has been supportive of our relationship and thinks my husband is a great stepfather. Our coparenting relationship has been challenging at times but we\u2019ve done just fine for the sake of our son. Last year, my ex eloped with this woman, Shelly (not her real name). They dated for only a year or so before marrying. I don\u2019t know her too well since we\u2019ve only met twice but I know she has three kids of her own, her oldest is about the same age as my son. My son dislikes her. He thinks Shelly is mentally unhinged, is way too involved in his personal business, and he blames her for being the reason he hasn\u2019t been able to spend as much quality time with his father lately.\n\nEarlier this week, I was coordinating with my ex about the details of our next tour. Everything was great until he mentioned that Shelly would be coming along on all our tours. I asked why and if it was necessary that she tag along. He said that she just wanted to be supportive. I asked him if her daughter was looking at these schools too, since she\u2019s also going to be a senior, and he said no. So why is she coming if her own child isn\u2019t planning on attending those schools? I told him that our son should get a say in who comes to the tours and that I would ask him what he thought about Shelly joining us. After I got off the phone with my ex, I asked our son if he wanted Shelly to come with us. He immediately replied no and that he wasn\u2019t comfortable with her coming.  I told our son that he should speak with his father and let him know about what he thinks. \n\nFast forward to last night, my ex calls and is furious that I would \u201cget our son involved in this matter.\u201d I replied that our son is the one touring the colleges and making decisions about his future, and he gets to decide who can come along. Not to mention, our son is almost an adult and at his age is more than capable of deciding who he wants in his life and to what extent. Son has been vocal to his father about his feelings about Shelly. He accepts that his father loves her but he doesn\u2019t see her as family. So I told my ex that if he loves his son and wants to continue having a positive relationship with him, then he needs to respect his wishes and leave his wife at home. End of story. Ex replies that I\u2019m an AH, Shelly cares about our son, and that he should be allowed to bring his wife with him whenever he chooses. \n\nWas I wrong?

She's using this to show how she thinks she's as good as stepdad is. How embarrassing for dad, but shouldn't be a problem for anybody else. NTA.", "NTA, there is only one vote and it's your son's. Keep an eye on this, though. Be aware that these aren't his words he's speaking, they are the new wife's.

I know I wouldn't want to tag along somewhere that I'm not wanted.", "Agreed. Why ask your son if you\u2019re not trying to start something. I try my best not to insert myself into my son\u2019s relationships with family. I personally would have left my displeasures with the ex. Informing/asking her son seems to stir the pot a bit.", "He did though\u2026", "Her husband has been his step father for as long as the son can remember. That's obviously very different than his father's wife who he only met when he was ~16 and doesn't particularly like.", "Having the one parent ask about their current partner, then getting the same parent to ask about their ex's current partner.

Would want to tag along for husband and future of their child.", "Actually he doesn't. He's not paying for anything and he's a child. It's above his pay grade.", "I think it's pretty clear why the son doesn't like her - copying his mum. OP, Your ex accepted your new partner but you can't do the same? Who cares how long they dated etc, you don't like her (your problem) but you're projecting this onto your son. And that makes you YTA", "So, mom can bring her husband, but dad can't bring his wife....hmmm, I have to think about this little more.", ">Shelley sounds like the type where if you give an inch, she\u2019ll take a mile.\n\nHow would anyone here know that? We have almost no information whatsoever about what she's like, other than a very vague third-hand impression passed to the OP from someone who doesn't like her. We don't even know if she actually wants to attend, or if her husband is the one insisting she goes.\n\nThe OP is absolutely not the AH and her ex is an AH for prioritising his wife (or his pride) over his son. But it's also possible that the OP's son is being unfair in his assessment of his dad's wife.", "Maybe it\u2019s more about spending time with her husband then the tour ? You just walk around and tour the facilities with a bunch of other families then sneak out at night for pre-froshman party", "Yes, but please remember that it's a lot easier than you think to be manipulated. It's not necessarily because people are weak. It's just how cognition works.", "Doesn\u2019t matter how the ex feels. Matters how the son feels and the son made the decision.", "She used the son as a pawn to get Shelly canceled.", "And if I was a step parent and my stepchild made it clear that they didn't want me on the trip, I would respect their boundaries because I know that forcing myself an invitation would only Make the issue worse, and further drive a wedge between me and the kid. \nBut then again that's just me and I actually recognize that kids are allowed to have feelings and opinions, and express those, and are allowed to expect those to be taken seriously.\nJust because they are the kid and you are the adult does not mean you always know best, it does not mean you are always right, it does not mean that you should always get your way. Sometimes your kid is the one in the right, and it is not wrong or immature or weak of you to admit that.", "So you're telling me you would deliberately go against your child's boundaries and comfortability just because your spouse wanted you to? You would sacrifice your child's mental and emotional well-being just because your spouse threw a temper tantrum? You would choose your spouse over your child? That's what it boils down to. Sometimes your kid isn't going to like your partner, and you're going to have to choose between the two of them. And if you don't choose your kid, well then you weren't ready to be a parent because your child should come before any extra partner that you have.\nSure your kid doesn't get to determine who you marry, but they definitely get to determine whether or not they want to spend extra time with them on top of any court ordered time. And if you try to force the situation, all you're doing is setting yourself up for a future of low to no contact because you can't respect boundaries.\n\nChildren are people too, with rights to autonomy, and rights to boundaries. They have rights to feelings and opinions, and rights to express those feelings and opinions. If you can't grasp that concept, you're not ready to be a parent.", "You know who is paying for this young man\u2019s college? Yes\u2014man. Not child.

Stepmom has only been around for about 2 years.\n\nYes, if you look at the roles the adults play here, inviting both stepparents looks fair and equal.\n\nBut if you are including people based on the son\u2019s relationship with them  and how well they know each other and their ability to help him decide which college to attend, the stepmom comes much lower on  the list.\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that OP says the son blames the stepmom for lack of quality father/son time lately. Maybe the son is hoping for some quality time with his dad without the stepmom around.", "I mean, son wants mom's husband there but doesn't want dads wife. He doesn't like Shelly. That's just life sometimes. \n\nNTA.", "The fact that his step dad has been in his life since he was 3 and his step mom for only a couple of years it makes sense that he feels closer to him and wants him there. He apparently feels like step mom is overbearing. He is old enough to decide who comes on the tour and who doesn't", "Yes, because the son is comfortable with the man who has been in his life for almost the whole of it coming along.", "Yeah, the impression I\u2019m getting is more of dad (and maybe Shelly, hard to say) trying to force a close relationship on his son.", "That's not true at all. \n\nCollege tours were especially important if you were going for scholarships, motivated you to work your ass off.", "Okay but here's the thing, the trip isn't for her and her husband. The trip is for her husband's son, the kid who is going to be potentially going to these colleges. Therefore the trip should be focused on him, not whatever the hell she wants or however she feels about it.\nIf the trip was for her, then it would make sense to take her feelings into account. But given that the trip is not for her, and she was not originally invited to begin with, then what she wants should not be taken into account here. It sucks, but sometimes you don't get to go on trips because you're not invited. Sometimes you have to grasp that concept. We teach that to children, so why can't grown adults accept that?", "I agr\u00e9e. \nBoth would be at fault in that scenario. Same happened with me and dads second wife. Horrible woman. But my dad had to check her when it came to my boundaries because I refused to deal with her drama when it came to visiting my dad.", "The ex asked. OP asked her son. The son said no. Yet somehow she manipulated him?", "How though?", "The spouse didn't throw a tantrum. That would be OP and her son. I'm saying he has no legitimate reason to dislike her that o p has given. And yes, I do not consider it his decision. But if he wants to claim adult status, then he can put his big boy pants on and act like it and be polite to stepmother. Especially if he's expecting them to continue funding him and his education.", "Conversely, my dad paid for my college because he had made it clear since I was 7 that my getting a master's degree was of utmost importance to him, but somehow besides the fact that he was a literall college professor, he didnt tour colleges with me or even guide me towatd filling out an application. Kinda nuts, actually. \n\n(And a huge waste  money. I didnt get a masters. I went to community college 2 years, then got 1 semester away from a BA at a state, but had to drop out cause life happened. All I had wanted to do was go to culinary school. Having parents with high expectations but lackluster support is weird)", "If you have children, never offer to help them financially if this is you view point. Your \u201chelp\u201d shouldn\u2019t be conditional especially when it comes to their education. It\u2019s their future, not yours!", "That\u2019s clearly not what the comment was referring to. The post is about who comes on the tours, not where they are touring. Clearly the commenter is saying the son is the only one who gets a say in who joins, literally no one is talking about where they are touring. And even if they were, not all parents pay for college. My parents came on tours and they didn\u2019t pay for school. And even if the parents were, the son could still chose to tour the school and his parents could then simply say they are not paying for a school that expensive. The son could they proceed with the school without his parents financial help if he wanted to. Either way (even though this isn\u2019t what the post or the comment is about) his parents don\u2019t necessarily need a say.", "So if we find out OP is footing the bill with loans then you would agree that Shelly has no business coming on the trip? \n\nMaybe he wants to take a trip to discuss his future with his actual parents, not his actual parents and his dad's annoying new wife? In which case, dad is the AH for not listening to his kid.", "Lots of \u201cmaybes\u201d here. OP has already stated the bio father contributed to the college fund.", "There was one maybe, and a question you didn't answer. My father contributed to my college fund too. Then he spent it all on a motorcycle when I got a scholarship, then I transferred schools and lost the scholarship and had to pay my own way. Funny how life works. Good parents should let their kids choose that life.", "But I did answer the question. It contains a false assumption: \u201cIf we find out OP is footing the bill\u2026\u201d\n\nOP is not footing the whole bill. She states bio Dad has contributed to the college fund. \n\nOnce again, I have not offered an opinion about Shelly coming on the trip.
