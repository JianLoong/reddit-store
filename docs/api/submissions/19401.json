We toured a few this spring and plan to tour several out of state ones throughout the summer. The plan was for myself, my husband, and his father to do the tours together. We\u2019ll be touring 4 schools, and he\u2019s coming to 3 of them. \n\nSome background: my son\u2019s father and I split up before our son was 6 months old. Soon after our relationship ended, I met my now husband and we got married when son was 3. My ex has been supportive of our relationship and thinks my husband is a great stepfather. Our coparenting relationship has been challenging at times but we\u2019ve done just fine for the sake of our son. Last year, my ex eloped with this woman, Shelly (not her real name). They dated for only a year or so before marrying. I don\u2019t know her too well since we\u2019ve only met twice but I know she has three kids of her own, her oldest is about the same age as my son. My son dislikes her. He thinks Shelly is mentally unhinged, is way too involved in his personal business, and he blames her for being the reason he hasn\u2019t been able to spend as much quality time with his father lately.\n\nEarlier this week, I was coordinating with my ex about the details of our next tour. Everything was great until he mentioned that Shelly would be coming along on all our tours. I asked why and if it was necessary that she tag along. He said that she just wanted to be supportive. I asked him if her daughter was looking at these schools too, since she\u2019s also going to be a senior, and he said no. So why is she coming if her own child isn\u2019t planning on attending those schools? I told him that our son should get a say in who comes to the tours and that I would ask him what he thought about Shelly joining us. After I got off the phone with my ex, I asked our son if he wanted Shelly to come with us. He immediately replied no and that he wasn\u2019t comfortable with her coming.  I told our son that he should speak with his father and let him know about what he thinks. \n\nFast forward to last night, my ex calls and is furious that I would \u201cget our son involved in this matter.\u201d I replied that our son is the one touring the colleges and making decisions about his future, and he gets to decide who can come along. Not to mention, our son is almost an adult and at his age is more than capable of deciding who he wants in his life and to what extent. Son has been vocal to his father about his feelings about Shelly. He accepts that his father loves her but he doesn\u2019t see her as family. So I told my ex that if he loves his son and wants to continue having a positive relationship with him, then he needs to respect his wishes and leave his wife at home. End of story. Ex replies that I\u2019m an AH, Shelly cares about our son, and that he should be allowed to bring his wife with him whenever he chooses. \n\nWas I wrong?
