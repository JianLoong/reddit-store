We toured a few this spring and plan to tour several out of state ones throughout the summer. The plan was for myself, my husband, and his father to do the tours together. We\u2019ll be touring 4 schools, and he\u2019s coming to 3 of them. \n\nSome background: my son\u2019s father and I split up before our son was 6 months old. Soon after our relationship ended, I met my now husband and we got married when son was 3. My ex has been supportive of our relationship and thinks my husband is a great stepfather. Our coparenting relationship has been challenging at times but we\u2019ve done just fine for the sake of our son. Last year, my ex eloped with this woman, Shelly (not her real name). They dated for only a year or so before marrying. I don\u2019t know her too well since we\u2019ve only met twice but I know she has three kids of her own, her oldest is about the same age as my son. My son dislikes her. He thinks Shelly is mentally unhinged, is way too involved in his personal business, and he blames her for being the reason he hasn\u2019t been able to spend as much quality time with his father lately.\n\nEarlier this week, I was coordinating with my ex about the details of our next tour. Everything was great until he mentioned that Shelly would be coming along on all our tours. I asked why and if it was necessary that she tag along. He said that she just wanted to be supportive. I asked him if her daughter was looking at these schools too, since she\u2019s also going to be a senior, and he said no. So why is she coming if her own child isn\u2019t planning on attending those schools? I told him that our son should get a say in who comes to the tours and that I would ask him what he thought about Shelly joining us. After I got off the phone with my ex, I asked our son if he wanted Shelly to come with us. He immediately replied no and that he wasn\u2019t comfortable with her coming.  I told our son that he should speak with his father and let him know about what he thinks. \n\nFast forward to last night, my ex calls and is furious that I would \u201cget our son involved in this matter.\u201d I replied that our son is the one touring the colleges and making decisions about his future, and he gets to decide who can come along. Not to mention, our son is almost an adult and at his age is more than capable of deciding who he wants in his life and to what extent. Son has been vocal to his father about his feelings about Shelly. He accepts that his father loves her but he doesn\u2019t see her as family. So I told my ex that if he loves his son and wants to continue having a positive relationship with him, then he needs to respect his wishes and leave his wife at home. End of story. Ex replies that I\u2019m an AH, Shelly cares about our son, and that he should be allowed to bring his wife with him whenever he chooses. \n\nWas I wrong?

Unless you're paying on your own, YTA majorly as you should know alienating the father could hurt your son.", "I read it as her ex husbands father will be going not the stepfather", "To a college tour.  And lots of people take family on those.", "I would have invited my grandma, but to be fair she legally adopted me when I was 13. I wouldn't have thought to ask my grandparents on my dads side or my grandpa on my moms side at the time. \n\nTo be even more fair, my grandma would have said \"for fucks sake, SinistralLeanings, why do I need to be there?\" Because she was a woman beyond her time. I miss her so much haha", "Immigrant families whose child is the first person in their family to attend college, and who have had 3 generations working to make it happen, and are so, so proud. They really want to be there to see it. They also come from cultures where \"is your family decent and reliable\" is a real consideration in applications. My mother is an ESL teacher, and saw this all the time, and had to work to help the family understand that although the message they are trying to send it \"kid comes from a supportive and reliable family that has their back, so you don't need to worry,\" many people in the US will take away \"kid has psycho overbearing family that will be an admin nightmare.\"", "Helicopter parenting also negatively impacts their kids self esteem and mental health. So many of those kids are so anxious, emotionally dysregulated, and distress intolerant. They don\u2019t feel safe doing anything on their own, because their parent wouldn\u2019t let them, and learn to manipulate situations to receive the constant validation from others that they now require. \n\nAs a pediatric nurse, I\u2019ll say helicopter parents make for pretty insufferable kids.", "Precisely. I took a chance and hired one of those kids once, one who had their mom wait just outside the interview room. One of my worst hiring decisions ever.", "If they behave anything like you are now yes they have a good reason to not like them. Maybe you can\u2019t see it because you are the same lol", "My father promised to pay for my college if I went to the school he chose. I never saw a dime. \n\nI did have a full scholarship, so only needed money for dorm/meal plan for the first 2 years. But I still ended up with $10,000 in loans because the scholarship didn't cover all of it. And neither did dad. The loan was very small, I'm certainly not complaining about that.", "This answer right here. I would drop the kid off and let them take the tour alone so they can really enjoy it. Then the adults (if they are paying for school) could either talk to the admissions office in person or on the phone for the details. Parents are embarrassing AF to kids at that age anyways. But I felt the nasty undertone in OP regarding the stepmom. Alienation damages kids beyond belief. Either leave both stepparents out of things or include both bc you are sending a f-ed up message to the kids with unequal treatment.", "All 3 are going. The only one excluded is stepmother, which while I understand could be seen as a slap in the face, they have vastly different relationships", "It\u2019s awful. I used to see children for therapy. The ones with helicopter parents had so much anxiety and could even make simple choices for themselves. It was heartbreaking. \n\nI have a sorority sister who was sheltered and had helicopter parents. She couldn\u2019t deal with being in college on her own and had to take a break for intensive therapy because of her anxiety level. She was unsure of herself and who she is outside of her parents.", "So what did he have against the place you chose? Or was it just a power move?"]}
