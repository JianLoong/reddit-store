Both our youngest and middle child have ADHD, the middle child being pretty severe and the youngest having ODD on top of it. My husband also has ADHD. Giving this info so you can get a picture of how insane and chaotic my household can be. There's constant noise and destruction (most of which is accidental). We also have a hyper energy anxious dog and 2 cats who do zoomies all night.\n\nMoving on. I'm tired. I'm edging being touched out. My husband, who is very in tune to me, picks up on it almost immediately and instantly starts trying to make it easier on me. Telling me to leave and go get a break while he handles things. That sort of thing. However, with gas prices being what they are and me not wanting to waste money, I simply go out on my porch with a coffee and a book most often while he wrangles the kids inside. We live in the city so when I'm on the porch there's still a load of noise but it's manageable. However, recently they converted the apartment building directly behind ours in to an adult group home. Currently they have roughly 5 men living there. A few with Autism, one with special ed needs and one with severe social anxiety. I know all this because recently if they see me on my porch, they all come out and start yelling across the way to speak to me. My husband often engages with them but I'm getting fed the F up. I want to relax, not engage in more conversation. However, I feel like a complete asshole and usually speak to them because it's not their fault and I'm sure they are lonely. \n\nWell last week I'm hanging clothes on the porch and the man with social anxiety immediately comes out, per usual. Starts trying to talk and I'm being polite. I go back inside, wait till I see him go inside and then go back out with my book. He comes right back out. I tell him I want to read and he just keeps talking. I politely dismiss myself and that afternoon went and bought a privacy sheet. I hung it up immediately following getting home and read my book in peace behind the sheet. My husband says it's \"fucking rude\" because they are just being friendly and now he feels like an AH because of me being so dismissive and petty.

Your husband needs to prioritize your needs over strangers", "Absolutely NTA. But your husband is. You don't have to engage with your neighbors just because they want to. You have every right to just have some quiet time. He can go off the porch and still engage with them all he wants.", "NTA. There's absolutely nothing wrong with making a space into a \"comfort zone\" for yourself this way. For a compromise maybe leave the screen up for the times your husband is outside or you don't require some solitude. If the neighbors ask, you or your husband can kindly explain that some days are hard for you too, and that you need quiet time.  If the screen is down it's one of those days.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nYou do not owe attention or response to random strangers. And frankly, if they have behavioral issues, that is a risk to you being alone\n\nYour husband is being an entitled AH. If he wants to talk to them, great. You're allowed to chill on your porch without being harassed.", "NTA. \n\nLiving in the city means theres almost no escape from the noise. you found a place that works but are being disturbed by outside forces, so you curbed that by adding a barrier that hopefully people will see and know that this person is busy. I think the husband is looking into this too deeply and cares far too much about what others think instead of placing your needs and the kids needs first and foremost.", "NTA. Self care is so important and often we have to enforce our boundaries in order to achieve it.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be available to your neighbors if you don\u2019t want to be. Your husband should know that.", "NTA - people who are neurodivergent (ND) frequently have different understandings of social norms.  To a neurotypical (NT), it is quite logical to think \u201coh, they\u2019re reading or busy, I won\u2019t disrupt them\u201d.  Whereas a ND person might think \u201coh! There\u2019s my friend let\u2019s chat!\u201d  The boundary might simply not be learned.  I\u2019d imagine you have some experience with this, since your house has a few ND folks. \n\n\nSince they\u2019re in an adult group home, I\u2019d imagine they do some work on boundaries and would appreciate you having a boundary with them.  It probably needs to be very clearly stated.  \n\n\nMaybe the boundary can be \u201cif the privacy sheet it up, they don\u2019t want to talk to me.  If it\u2019s down, it\u2019s time to party!\u201d\n\n\nI can see your husband\u2019s perspective a bit too - I wonder if a conversation with the adults or their care givers would have sufficed.  \u201cHey, if I\u2019m doing laundry or reading, I don\u2019t want to have any interaction because I\u2019m taking personal space\u201d.  \n\n\nBut!  I am very influenced by my environment and would be distracted and annoyed if there was nowhere I could get peace without leaving my home.  So, I think it\u2019s totally cool to make yourself a little outdoor fort.  Your husband can interact with them however he likes\u2026 and is the privacy sheet easily installed/removed?  Because it doesn\u2019t have to be up all the time.  \n\n\nIn summary - you deserve a break from all the noise and chaos and your husband should 1) respect that,  2) value your clear headspace over the feelings of the adults in the group home,  and 3) help you come up with an acceptable solution if he doesn\u2019t agree with your current solution.", "NTA. No one has to be forced to converse with anyone.", "NTA. Having social, and physical boundaries, is completely ok. Your husband may feel a \"social obligation\" to interact with people or may enjoy socializing in a different way than you. Perhaps your husband can go visit your neighbors to socialize with them while you spend time recharging. This sounds like compromise should be discussed.", "NTA. It\u2019s concerning that your husband cares more about \u201chow it looks\u201d to neighbors than his wife.", "NTA!!", "NTA. I understand husband\u2019s side, as I am someone that likes to please and it gives me anxiety to maybe come off a certain way, but I would totally take this approach too after all of your interactions. This is your place to relax\u2026 enough is enough!", "NTA. You're not obligated to talk to others or force yourself to. That's just that.", "NTA. It\u2019s your home and you shouldn\u2019t have to accommodate neighbours feelings in how you spend your time on your property. I don\u2019t care how friendly they are, they also don\u2019t respect boundaries.", "NTA - You absolutely deserve to have some quiet/privacy.  Maybe he likes being social with them, so maybe find a happy medium.  Instead of the sheet, find something that can be rolled up like one of those bamboo dividers, or split the sheet and find a way to tie it back.  You can have it down, and when you are finished, it can be tied-up/rolled up for when he is there and wants to be social...", "NTA", "NTA- can\u2019t he just roll up the sheet when he wants to be social? I feel like this could be framed as a win-win for you both.\n\nthat you didn\u2019t intend on being rude but felt like your personal boundaries were being crossed, so you need a physical boundary to have your alone time. \n\nWhen he\u2019s feeling social, he can choose to open the privacy sheet and chat with the neighbors. \n\nEveryone now has a choice, instead of being forced to engage. \n\nJust because others have mental illness does not mean you can\u2019t have boundaries, strong boundaries is actually an important aspect of living with/around people who have various disabilities, for everyone\u2019s peace.", "NTA\n\nPeople with autism do not always have social concepts of privacy or that someone else may not want to engage in small talk.", "NTA. It's only down when you are out there and want/ need privacy. Where would your husband like you to go during these times when you need a break?", "NTA you need a quiet space.  Its intrusive to have them want to talk to you all the time.", "NTA, if you don't get time to yourself, you will get touched out. Your husband needs to understand this, and also, who cares if it were \"fucking rude\"? Those guys are strangers. Explain to him that he's being more considerate to 5 grown men, who again, are strangers, than his own wife.", "NTA.\n\nYou have been friendly but sometimes you just dont want to engage and thats okay.\n\nYour neighbour's may not realize through social cues that you want to be left alone and even telling them you don't want tovtalk to them maybe trigger them.  \n\nSo realistically a privacy block is a pretty friendly and non confrontational way to have some peace and quiet. \nDon't think you did anything wrong", "NTA.\n\nI have a \"recovery house\" next door. When we have problems we talk to the house manager. It seems like this place should have someone in charge. \n\nFind out who runs the place and talk to them (not the residents) and let them know that people should not come over to your porch uninvited. The people who live in the house need to know what the boundaries are and it's not your responsibility to explain it.", "NTA. Sounds like a good solution to me.", "NAH - Damn OP, that is unfortunate as fuck. I would say N T A but those poor guys across the street can\u2019t really help the way they are. Doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be disable and be an AH but it doesn\u2019t seem like these guys are that. \n\nYou want your privacy and you live across the way from a group home. They are being friendly, but they are disabled and do not understand that they are invading your personal time and space. There is also no way to reason with them in the same way you would a neurotypical individual. \n\nIt\u2019s not necessarily rude. I think your husband is just an extra nice guy so that\u2019s the way he sees it. Your not a bad person for wanting your time alone and not be bothered.", "NTA. But here's something to think about: is your husband being lenient with these busybodies because they have mental disorders like he does? It's no excuse, and you were justified in your actions.

So the sheet is a privacy draw sheet. All I need to do is pull the chord and it retracts in to itself. It's one of the bamboo ones. So it's easily put away but I think my husband sees issue in it because the sheet is down more and more because I'm getting very touched out and have been needing quite a few \"time outs\" more recently. See, the school pushed for my daughter (middle child) to be medicated due to disruptive behavior and I accommodated because.. well I know how it can be. But none of the meds worked. They've tried several. And about two weeks ago I said \"no more\" because I didn't like how she was reacting to it and I just don't want to keep pushing different meds (the last one was terrible and she started hallucinating while being a complete zombie of a person). So they started weening her and holy hell, she's off the walls lmao damn good kid but her energy is off the charts. She hits to get your attention, while laughing, and she hits hard despite only being 10. She means no harm and she feels bad when she knows she hurts you but I've been needing to step out frequently because it can be super overwhelming. So my husband sees that privacy barrier down A LOT and he just immediately thinks I'm trying to push these guys away.", "I agree with all of this. NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not rude to create some privacy and boundaries. \n\nTo be honest, I have to do this sort of thing even with my partner. Untreated ADHD and he will holler for me or interrupt me in the middle of a shower to tell me some inconsequential, non emergent thing. I have to be very straightforward with him and remind him\u2014regularly\u2014that if the bathroom door is closed, unless it\u2019s an emergency, he needs to leave me alone. It\u2019s the only place I can go and be alone.

So whenever I'm done getting my space I immediately pull the chord and put it away, so to speak.

I think that's what he has a problem with because the sheet is down at least 3 times a day.", "Thats a possibility. He never really explained to me why he engages with them that often other than him feeling bad for them. However, I think it may be a bit deeper than that. See, my Uncle recently passed away and he was special needs. My husband never got the chance to meet him because he was in a group home out of state, but he knew how close I was to him during my entire childhood. So I think he may have some guilt surrounding that issue and because of the guilt, he engages with these guys as often as he can.", "NTA. Your husband is trying to prioritize your neighbors\u2019 possible hurt feelings over your needs. You need some peaceful and quiet alone time for your own sake. I\u2019m sorry, but who cares if they\u2019re being friendly? You don\u2019t want to talk. They don\u2019t NEED to talk to you and they\u2019re not entitled to your time, and the fact that your husband thinks you should have to engage with them at any time you happen to be outside at the same time as any of the 5 men living in the group home, at your expense is ridiculous. \n\nAlso, I would not consider that guy\u2019s behavior as just being friendly. I know sometimes social anxiety and being neurodivergent will make it hard to understand what is socially acceptable or weird, but if someone kept going inside their apt and coming back out at the exact same time as me just because they want to talk especially after I said I dont want to, I\u2019d consider them a potential problem and tread with caution, because honestly, it\u2019s a bit unsettling and way too presumptuous and entitled.", "Those guys aren\u2019t your responsibility.

The residents are unlikely to get any message you give them about needing space & privacy, especially if sometimes they can talk to you & sometimes they can't. Talk to their house manager. If they don't happen to be on-site when you go over, staff can put you in touch.

Or making a nice spot in the front of your house.", "He has social anxiety so he comes talk to you? That's the opposite of social anxiety...weird but...of course NTA. Your husband seemed like a nice supportive guy. He's 100% wrong on this one.

I read about it on pubmed, not some weird fringe crunchy blog.

Me and my husband were upset cuz then our weird neighbor would try to start conversations with us. We're both introverts and not very social so it was terrible. It wasn't anything important either, just weird small talk that was unending. The weeds and bushes have not grown back so we're thinking of getting something for privacy.

And to me, a total introvert, even 10 minutes of her can be draining.  I can't imagine dealing with 5 of them, and they are invading your space.

I literally cross the street and hide to avoid having to say hello to people I know and like.\n\nI don't think you're TA for wanting a private space to relax and be alone. I think you're kind of TA for tossing around labels and diagnoses in a pretty judgmental way.", "NTA. Your house sounds exhausting. You need a break.

You don't need to engage with any of your neighbors just because you're both outside, particularly if they struggle with social cues.\n\nNot the same thing but we have a special needs employee at work who also really struggles with boundaries and is quite social and you have to be extremely blunt with him quite often or the conversation won't end (which is a problem when you're trying to work or if he's coming over and interrupting an ongoing conversation.) But he does know that closed door means \"do not disturb.\" Honestly, that kind of clear visual clue is often quite helpful for people who struggle with social cues!", "nta at all but communication goes a long way, probably should talk to him about things before hand just to keep him in the loop. he shouldn\u2019t act like that for something this small and no you aren\u2019t obligated to tell him what you\u2019re doing, but my hubby likes to know what\u2019s going on and how i\u2019m feeling before i do things even if it\u2019s something small.", "NTA\n\n\n>Giving this info so you can get a picture of how insane and chaotic my household can be.

It's important to TEACH social rules to Autistic people and not rely on them \"picking up on cues\" or \"reading between the lines\" or \"following unwritten rules.\" Expecting them to just intuit that OP reading by herself means she's not interested in chatting probably wouldn't work, unless she tells them she's not interested now. Using the privacy blind is a good way to demonstrate that she's not available for chatting--it is a clear yes/no visual signal.\n\nOP and/or her husband should talk to the management to make sure that they can use whatever in-house system (house meetings, rule lists, etc.) the residents are formally informed by their staff and that staff can reinforce the rules. It is not OP's job to have a chat with the group home neighbor guys and patiently explain \"Hey, do you ever have times when you're tired and you don't want to have a conversation?\" but it IS the management's job.\n\nThe group home residents need to be able to accept \"no\" as an answer if they're going to live in the community. Neighbors (and other community members) shouldn't be guilted into chatting when they don't feel like it just because they might be disappointed.\n\nAlso, the main reason Autistic people might not understand privacy is that they are not allowed to have privacy.", "What's not nice or normal enough about a roll-up blind? And if she goes out in the front yard, then everyone with a dog will want to chat. Or maybe there's a lot of traffic.", "I noticed that, too. People with social anxiety (like my friend's lodger) want to avoid talking.", "Probably they talked about their diagnoses with her super-friendly husband?

If you own, put up a tall solid fence.  Your back home area is you and your family's place of refuge.  It is not your job to provide socialization for a group home.  There are other ways for that need to be met.   If a fence is not possible, then do not be subtle  in your message to the group home.  You are not wanting to be friends.  Please do not talk to me.  Use those words.  Use them to each home resident that tries to talk to you.  Encourage your husband, if he wants to socialize, to go to the front of that residence and visit on their property.  Perhaps they can play board games together.", "Totally agree. Plus, from the sound of it, some of the residents in the home group home probably have a hard time understanding social cues.

I was exhausted just reading your post, I'd go out of my mind if I could never get a moment's peace, between my kids, husband, pets and now neighbors.

Kids and husband all ADHD and my youngest with ODD. Constantly had other outside issues bombarding me. Codependent mother who was a recent widow. I spent my 30's so burnt out.  I lost myself and was just always on the verge of a mental breakdown.  Do whatever it takes to find those moments for yourself.  I don't care who thinks you're selfish, taking time for yourself will benefit everyone! You can only do so much and setting boundaries and taking care of you is necessary.  Good luck! Turned 40 this past year and I'm finally taking my life back. It feels great!", "Have you spoken to the support staff about this? When I worked in a mental health unit we had a similar issue with one of my clients and we'd work extra hard to keep her distracted so she didn't bother the neighbours.

I'd drop them a note or call and just put it out there if you haven't already.", "If she's clearly told him that she doesn't want to talk to him and he continues to overstep, there's a staff person in that home that can help her. They are supervised mostly to protect them, but also to help them interact with others. As far as I've read, nothing out of the ordinary has happened. Every person I've had live in one of my group homes craved attention from outside people. They're often ignored. The neighbor is probably excited to talk to someone new. There are employees available if needed.", "The people who run the group home need to be aware of the men's behaviour. You are entitled to oersonal space and I privicy screen is totally appropriate.", "NTA\n\nYou rely on your porch as a quiet place to get down time.

You are not some unpaid cruise director, there to play host to every unwanted interruption.", "NTA, how is wanting peace and quiet being rude?", "Nta, tell him you deserve some private time to yourself.

If you need privacy, then do what you need to do to get it. \n\nHe can be sociable in his own time. You don't have to live by his rules.\n\nBTW: Have you ever considered having your middle child evaluated for a mood disorder? My son was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, ADHD, and ODD. His meds didn't help him a great deal, but it provided with the various interventions at school and at home that he needed. One thing I got was someone qualified to be with him for a few hours every day so I could have some time to rest."]}
