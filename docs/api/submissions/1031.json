Whether she terminates the pregnancy or not is 100% her choice. However, I would think at the very least he should have been brought into the loop to provide comfort and act as a sounding board while she works out what she wants to do.

OP has no right to withhold this information from him.

I, too, probably would have taken the test when she suggested it.\n\nIf I were in your SIL's shoes, I wouldn't have said a word. It's literally not her place to say anything as it doesn't concern her at all. I love my brothers, but if I knew one of their wives (who I was close to) was pregnant and didn't want to tell them yet, I'd leave it be unless it got ridiculous, like waiting two or three months to say something. She should have respected your wish to keep it to yourselves.\n\nOn top of it, I would *never* bring something like this up at a family dinner. If it was weighing on my mind and I felt like I *needed* to say something, I'd wait until *after* the dinner, tell my brother I needed to talk to him once everyone else leaves, and tell him then so that you two could be alone to work it out and not rat out the secret to the entire family.\n\nHad she told him in private, I'd think it'd be okay to be pissed at her, but keep her in the wedding. But she outed your secret to *everyone*, even if it was inadvertent. Now if you and your fiance decide you don't want the baby, everyone is going to know that you were pregnant but now you're not.

How strongly does he feel about waiting for kids - if she chooses to continue the pregnancy it has the possibility of ending their relationship. Taking a break up into account she also needs to consider the reality of becoming a single mom. These are complicated, life altering decisions that are far more permanent than a wedding/marriage. She knew her fiance would be unhappy with the news to some degree, I totally understand wanting to know your own thoughts before starting that conversation with a SO.  Also while ethically unsound and detrimental to their relationship she doesn't have to tell him at all. She could choose to get an abortion and never tell him, its her body, her choice and preferably his opinion. Choosing to have this baby is 100% her choice as well, pressuring her into having an abortion is beyond red flags and even if it's just his preference not to have a baby now/her have an abortion, that's no reason to have an abortion if she doesn't want one.

Maybe he wants to wait 10 years. Maybe she wants a baby immediately post wedding. Maybe shes in an earth mother birthing cult and thinks she needs to have 30 kids to go to heaven. Who knows.

(and this isn't just a woman doing it thing. Some men fuck with birth control/force pregnancies). Having/not having kids is one of those compatibility things that no one should ever try to change in a relationship. It rarely ends well. If you want kids, find someone else that does. If you don't want kids, same. Don't 'settle', because one or both of you is going to try to change the other's minds and it's going to wind up with some poor kid being born into a family where half of it doesn't want them and they can't say that because 'man/woman up and just be a parent, god you heartless ass'.

There's really no other conversation to have, and by not having it, you're leaving a huge possible conflict to blow up in each-other's faces.

It's also worth considering how young you are and what might change. There's a huge change in brain development and maturity between like 18-25 or so. I met my wife when she was 20 (I was 23). She was a pretty different person by the time we got married than from when we met, and so was I. But we had enough time to watch each other develop and see that we still loved the people we grew into. \n\nMarriage is not super important or necessary for love. It can wait. Whatever it symbolizes to you, at the core, it's still just a financial institution. It's all about combining your finances. You have to be ready to take on each other's debts and function as a single unit. And it's an expensive nightmare to get out of once you're in. There's absolutely no point in rushing it, I think doing so is a terrible idea. It really changed nearly nothing about our lives. We'd already bought a house and loved our lives as a single unit for years. All that changed by then was a certificate and a ring. We're taking out time and planning ahead for kids too.

I wonder how often OP has waited/left a decision too late/not told her partner until it was too late to do anything about it. It's a concerning pattern of behaviour.\n\nMight be why the SIL gave 3 weeks, because it was just enough time to do something about it, and she knew her best friend had a habit of \"forgetting\" to have these discussions, so the choice was made by default i.e. being what OP wanted all along.", "Sounds like SIL pulled him aside during family dinner to tell him, and then when brother blew up at OP it was in front of everyone so the news was out", "or she doesn't want to tell him yet because she's thinking about getting an abortion.

All the wild \u201cshe\u2019s trying to trap him in a marriage with a kid he doesn\u2019t want!\u201d replies are so odd.

OP isn\u2019t an asshole for uninviting her, since that was the question. She is an asshole if she actually was trying to baby trap him. Fiance is an asshole for not being able to discuss the situation like an adult - I kind of wonder if there\u2019s a reason she was scared to tell him other than the \u201cI think I want to keep it\u201d thing, because it sounds like his reaction was over the top.

But in the long run, disinviting a close friend and family member  could create years of family drama, resentment by the fiance, and possible regret by the OP. It would be in OP's best interest to work through her valid anger and let the SIL come to avoid a protracted feud.", "I\u2019m shocked by the overwhelming amount of comments that hold no empathy for either party and are making unfounded accusations of malicious or manipulative behavior by OP. \nOP has indicated her partner does not want children, or at least does not want children right now. There is nothing in the post to indicate that OP was expecting him to eventually change his position or trying to baby trap him. I don\u2019t understand why people are making that leap. All birth control is fallible; sometimes things happen. \nThere is also a big difference between deciding not to become pregnant and terminating an existing pregnancy.\nKnowing you are pregnant and knowing your partner does not want a baby is an incredibly difficult position to be in if there\u2019s a chance you want to keep the baby. There\u2019s a high chance she will have to decide between her unborn child and her partner. It sounds like that fact is not lost on her and needing time to process that is understandable. \nOn the other side, not wanting a child and knowing that your partner is pregnant, but not knowing what your partner wants to do is an incredibly difficult position to be in and can leave you in a panicked and anxious limbo. Its doubly stressful because you have to worry about what your partner is going to decide and you have to worry about what you\u2019re going to do if your partner decides to continue the pregnancy. It can also result in the person pressuring their partner either to make a decision or to make the decision they prefer. \nOP needed time to figure out where she stood before putting both her partner and herself in that position. If she needed more than three weeks, then she needed more than three weeks. If you disagree with that, you should take a step back and try to conceptualize the immensity of having to end a potentially wanted pregnancy or end an engagement. The only time limit that should be placed is the wedding. OP would be TAH if she waited until after the wedding or even right up to the wedding date to tell him, but there is no indication that\u2019s what is happening and unless OP made a comment I missed, the people saying that are making a hugely unfair accusation. \nSIL had no business sharing that information in front of his family and creating a confrontational situation that involved anyone other than OP and her partner. Personally, I think SIL was out of line, but I also understand that\u2019s a hard secret to have to keep from your sibling. However, given the way in which she decided to release that information, I wonder whether it was out a sense of loyalty to her brother or to cause drama or a rift. \nOP, it\u2019s his sister you\u2019re disinviting. You can\u2019t unilaterally make that decision. That\u2019s a conversation that needs to happen with your partner and if he decides he wants her there, then you need to decide what you want to do from there.

Like it\u2019s YOUR fault? \n\nThe length of time you took to tell him and the fact that the sister in no way gave you time to process on your own tells me that no one respects you in this relationship. The fact that you took that much time because you were so afraid of that reaction concerns me the most. \n\nUltimately, your fears were validated when he and his sister both publicly humiliated you in front of their entire family. \n\nYou didn\u2019t deserve that. No one deserves that. \n\nYou were afraid you were pregnant. You were afraid when you found out that you were in fact pregnant. And you\u2019re still afraid because no one in this entire situation has showed you any sort of compassion. The only person anybody has cared about at all is how upset the fianc\u00e9 is going to be. \n\nI\u2019m sad that you had to experience this. And I\u2019m sad you\u2019ve been put in this position.\n\n\nYou should look at your relationships and think about if you would have done this to anyone you love. And then ask yourself why you feel like you deserve to be loved this way. Either way, this baby will be born to someone who doesn\u2019t want it. And you will be forever trapped with the knowledge that somehow this is your fault. \n\nIs uninviting his sister from the wedding really the problem here?

What you didn't know was how poorly he would react, some men who don't want kids get physically violent with news like this. You had every right to process, but depending where you are you have a time limit on making decisions about what to do. Do not marry this man, he has proven that he is irresponsible enough to claim he doesn't want kids but hasn't nipped the issue at the source. He should get sterilized, if he doesn't even with protection it is not 100% and a pregnancy can still happen. \n\nDo better for yourself no matter what you decide. Is a man who explodes at you over something he is also responsible for happening? If you decide to keep it he will likely call off the engagement if he is vehemently against having kids and being responsible. This man is a flamming red flag if you can't even tell him of a pregnancy he helped make. \n\nYou deserve someone who wouldn't get mad at you over something like this.

But in front of everyone is unnecessary and definitely going to cause drama and a very dick move", "This comment should be higher up \ud83d\ude02", "The other oddity is that she tells her fianc\u00e9's sister to keep a huge secret from her family--one that impacts everyone!  Family first.  OP put the sister in a very unfair predicament and sister chose family.\n\nThe other red flag was the uninviting the sister from \"my wedding\".  It's his wedding too and can just reinvite his sister.  \n\nOP sounds a bit self centred.  I agree with you, I definitely think she's the YTA!", "Yes.", "She knew he would want an abortion and didn't want to be pressured into one before she was sure what she wanted. She said so in a comment. People are being gross to her about it. He wanted kids later.", "She said she\u2019s in the uk in the comments", "OP is in the UK, that\u2019s not an issue for her.", "Don\u2019t you think you should marry someone who has the same views as you when it comes to wanting kids\u2026", ">\"I wasn't sure what I wanted and I wanted to be 100% sure how I felt about the pregnancy before I told him\"\n\nSo I totally understand where you're coming from. But the point I think everyone here is trying to make is that the man you're supposed to marry should be able to help you make these decisions. Not push his own opinions on you. It's called a partnership because you're supposed to work through things together. \n\nIf you knew what he wanted, and you decided you wanted something else, what would've happened? A fight? Or love and support?", "But this is not how either marriage or emotional intimacy works. You need to feel comfortable exploring your feelings together. \n\nThe underlying text here is that you seem like you were worried he would pressure you into an abortion, which is a terrible thing to think about the person you want to spend the rest of your life with. Keeping it from him for 3 weeks is basically making it extremely difficult to terminate the pregnancy, which is probably the sister's point. \n\nYou clearly don't trust him to hold your best interests at the same importance as his, and work as a team to find the best solution possible. \n\nSoft YTA but you need counselling, not a wedding.", "my question is: why are you marrying someone when that someone results in you being completely ran over in big decisions like these? The person you marry should be the person you turn to when you face difficult situations like these, even when they want something that you may not want, because that person cares about you and your well-being and your feelings.", "I'd say the sister is TA because she could have chosen a better, more private time for the conversation instead of in front of family.", "I just feel really bad for you rn. you should stop reading this thread and talk to a counselor if you can. Best of luck to u", "Telling him in front of the entire family is really really horrible though", "I think she was considering an abortion maybe", "Congratulations? In some countries outside of the US it\u2019s illegal to be pregnant outside of marriage. Shits dangerous for women yo", "Thanks for sharing, I'm glad everything eventually worked out for you in the end (or at least sounds like it did). Age is a big factor, too. A lot of growth would have happened from 22-25+. I imagine you're a very different person now, and it's hard to see what you're missing behind that bottle of booze. No shame, though! All part of the growing process. \n\nJust to share my own anecdote in return: I was about a year off from trying to marry my high school sweetheart during the height of my early college party years (was with her for 3 years, starting my senior year), before I made some major mistakes that ruined it. And I'm thankful I did. There was a lot of learning and growing that came out of that relationship and it's destruction. Without it, I wouldn't have learned what I needed to build what I now have. It was an important part of my life that I don't regret, because those are the pivotal moments that make us better people if you're willing to embrace your failure and learn from it.", "Well here\u2019s hoping a five year old is not pregnant", "She also says he wouldn\u2019t be happy, so I assumed he would vote abortion too. I\u2019m guessing he would want an abortion, but she wasn\u2019t sure if she wanted one, so wanted to decide for herself before telling him. (Not that that makes this any better!)", "Delaying it for three weeks (considering most women don\u2019t know they are pregnant until six weeks plus) leads me to believe she had no intention of seeking an abortion and was, indeed, attempting to delay telling him until \u201cit is too late.\u201d\n\nOP, YTA, for everything.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t worry about the wedding, because this marriage won\u2019t last.", "Yeah, really dick move.  Especially because she had to know the drama that would ensue.  That wasn\u2019t SIL\u2019s news to share.", "I think she told him privately, but while they were at a family event, and then he confronted OP in front of everybody. Agree she shouldn't have done it at a family event, though.", "Sounds like future SIL assumed OP was considering terminating the pregnancy and put her in a position where it would be a lot harder to do.", "Waiting for 3+ weeks is more than enough time to have this conversation.", "It was fianc\u00e9 who brought it up at dinner not SIL", "I agree.", "Yeah that\u2019s the other one.  She doesn\u2019t want a kid yet and knows that while he might want to wait he\u2019s going to be opposed to abortion, so if she decides to go that way she can just hide it forever.", "Yep!", "You can find out if you are pregnant now after 1st day of missed period.  Also, sounds like they weren't using protection if she thought she might be.", "Growing up I was always told you figured out those things after. You see, the most important thing was being in \u2661love\u2661. Everything else just works out! And from what I can see yes, this does lead to plenty of people marrying the first person they date. \n\nI'm sure the mass of divorces by 30 are unrelated.", "She wrote that she was sure it would be negative, so she did on a lark.  The positive result was a surprise.", "No birth control is 100% failproof.  Majority of those who get abortions WERE on birth control.", "I really think that there ought to be a required marriage prep class that is essentially \u201chave you discussed this yet?\u201d  Being Catholic we had to do prep and the first one was a scantron of some 40-50 questions that were all \u201chave you discussed shared finances/children/raising children?\u201d  Nothing was \u201care you in agreement with the Church\u2019s teachings\u201d, FYI.", "OP lives in the UK, where women have bodily autonomy. She can have an abortion until she's 16 weeks.\nEdit to correct time.", "As the child of an adoptee, thank you so much for bringing up the trauma of adoption. It\u2019s really frustrating when people act as if adoption is all butterflies and rainbows when frankly I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that way for the vast majority involved in every side of the process.\n\nEdit: I would also just like to add for anyone that might come across this and does not know that even in the best of circumstances, when a child is adopted immediately into a family that is genuinely going to love and care for them to the best of their ability, there is still trauma for that child. Please look into adoptees sharing their stories if you would like to know more.", "Yes I think that\u2019s where they went wrong. I made it clear to my now husband (we\u2019re waiting a few years for kids) that if we did get pregnant I wasn\u2019t going to be aborting or anything, it\u2019s not personally what I want even if I personally don\u2019t want kids yet. He was on board with me that we both wanted to wait but also understood the risks of it obviously being a possibility and what we were okay with as a result. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d have been jumping for joy had it happened but I knew and he knew that together we\u2019d figure it out and I could tell him anything. I can\u2019t imagine being so scared to tell him or him acting surprised as if he didn\u2019t know how it got there", "Well, looks like I'm going against the grain, NTA.  It is OP's decision who and when to tell.  She wasn't hiding it from her fiance, she was processing how she felt about it.  No one else gets to decide how long that takes.  Did OP go nuclear?  Yes, but she was ganged up on by his whole family and felt the need to defend herself.  I probably would have reacted in a similar manner.   OP is an adult, no one has the right to give her a deadline to tell someone something about her own body and life.", "Nope, NTA. Say what you will about her not telling her fianc\u00e9, but it was her news to tell, not her future SIL's, regardless of familial bonds. Her future SIL inserting herself in this only exacerbated an already tense and difficult situation.", "Everyone seems to judge you on anything but the point you asked judgement for...\n\nYes on the global situation I'd say y t a, but concerning your SIL, she was your best friend and SIL, you trusted her, she proved you can't trust her. She might have thought of her brother, but it doesn't change the fact she didn't respect your wellbeing and betrayed you. Nobody wants to give their trust to people who will deal with it on conditions. Typically not the kind of people you want at your wedding, so NTA.", "And the guy is planning to marry someone who won't let his sister come to the wedding because sister was more loyal to him than to fiance.", "My partner and I weren\u2019t planning on kids and we\u2019re told I couldn\u2019t have any anyway.  So we weren\u2019t as careful and well\u2026SURPRISE, I ended up pregnant.\n\nHe was the first person I told my period was late and he said he knew then because normally when I\u2019m late (years of irregular cycles makes you shrug it off lol) I\u2019d say, \u201cit\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry.\u201d  It\u2019s like we both knew what we were told was impossible had happened.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine not telling him.  And yeah, he didn\u2019t handle it well - it was just such a shock.  It\u2019s honestly his one regret and the stress he put me through due to his reaction the first week.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine waiting THREE WEEKS when they\u2019re already engaged and clearly have their wedding planned.", "she didn't tell him so she could force him into a being a dad before he is ready.", "This really does not apply. They are planning a wedding and are inviting people to join them They are not broke. They can travel to a place where abortion is legal if that is the real issue. This has nothing to do with the OP's post.", "This. Depending on where OP lives, ex-bff may have potentially put her in a very dangerous situation.", "Be that as it may, if is completely her prerogative . Not the SILs secret to tell. NTA", "That's what bothers me.  Not that future sister in law told him but how she told him", ">she told him herself while we were having dinner with their family. He was so upset he confronted me in front of everybody\n\nHE (the fianc\u00e9) told the family, not SIL.  SIL told fianc\u00e9 while together for a family dinner, but not in front of the family, as they only found out when fianc\u00e9 confronted OP in front of the family.\n\nSo to everyone dissing the SIL and accusing her of creating drama, YTA and you owe SIL an apology ;-)", "Have you ever been pregnant? At a young age and knowing the father wouldn\u2019t be happy? I say NTA because she was trying to figure out what she was feeling herself, and AH SIL went ahead and couldn\u2019t wait to tell her bro what *wasn\u2019t her news to tell* in a matter of weeks\u2026 \n\n Bruh, really? OP is not the AH. Her fianc\u00e9 and his family (SIL, ofc) are for dealing with it so publicly instead of privately.", "She has said repeatedly it\u2019s not time sensitive where she lives.", "Three weeks is too long to spend making that decision. There is a point where SIL probably should tell the brother, but at a family dinner is a total AH move", "She can take all the time she needs to feel sure of herself. Meanwhile she needs to communicate that to her partner as he needs to know what\u2019s going on in their relationship too.", "How could she baby trap him this way. She can always decide not to have an abortion. It was never going to be his decision. The wedding isn\u2019t until April, so it\u2019s not like she could trap him with marriage before he knew. There is no trapping at this point. Baby trapping would be intentionally getting pregnant when you knew that your partner didn\u2019t want to have a baby. It doesn\u2019t seem like that is the case.", "I feel pretty much the same way. Sometimes I think I want kids (a particularly cute interaction with Ray Toro on stage with his kids recently made me think man I would love to have that) but then the reality of kids and my own situation kicks in and I remember I really would not be any good at it. I'm just sad i missed so much of my niblings growing up being at university.\n\nPlus, the idea of being pregnant and cleaning up poop isn't for me. I can't deal with bodily fluids other than blood and spit, lol. Emetophobia, too.\n\nI just hate how like you said, childfree communities are full of smug people talking about \"crotch fruits\" and \"cum pets\", which is really gross. Then the anti childfree communities all say shit to me like if you don't have kids you'll be alone forever or something.", "People don\u2019t seem to understand that. Sometimes there\u2019s choice, but all of the choices are awful. \ud83d\ude14", "Every adoption stems from tragedy even if they are idyllic and filled with love.
