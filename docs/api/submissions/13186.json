Wow\u2026 so much to unpack in that story. That is not something someone should be having to accept in any relationship. \n\nYou concentrating on wanting an apology is so sad to me. Please talk to a therapist if you don\u2019t currently have one. Not because you are doing anything wrong, but because you need some emotional support. \n\nYour husband is infantilizing you; calling your expressing a reasonable reaction to his behavior a tantrum\u2026 unless you are screaming on the floor or throwing things, not okay to say to your his wife.", "No it's not wrong to expect an apology for throwing out this thing you just bought.  It's not right that he threw it out, and it's even worse that he pulled all this nonsense.  I'm wondering if he just wanted to fight, hence throwing it out in the first place.  \n\nHe sounds extremely manipulative and controlling to tell you what you need to do, to call it a tantrum when you calmly explain things, and gaslighting. That stuff is not cool.  It's abusive and toxic.  You're definitely NTA.
