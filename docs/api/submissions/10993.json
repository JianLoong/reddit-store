If you can\u2019t get Thursday off from work, please consider going out of your way to make sure your gf is supported. Perhaps buy some flowers and leave them as a surprise for when she gets home from the appointment. Make sure she has a heated pad ready at home by the bed or couch. Set up her favorite snacks or some chocolate for when she gets home, with a card telling her that you love and support her, and that you recognize the pain she went through that day benefits both of you.

She wanted her partner to be able to be there to support her, and he said no.
