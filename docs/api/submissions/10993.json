This, to me, sounds like a miscommunication between you and your girlfriend.

IUDs can be stupidly painful\u2014I am a grown ass woman who is like a decade older than you and I get super anxious about it\u2014plus gyno appointments can be really anxiety-inducing and uncomfortable, even simple check-ups\n\n- It can be hard to ask for what you need clearly\u2014sometimes even to *know* what you need\u2014such as needing support from a loved one. I think she easily may have been too indirect when asking/explaining this (she may have thought she was being direct but was not being direct enough for others to understand)\n\n- You didn\u2019t understand or hear her emotional call and instead thought she was just asking casually (as if it was not a big deal). Answering as if it was a casual ask would make sense then from your standpoint\n\n- She was hurt because she interpreted your response as a sign that you do not care about her/will not support her\n\nMy advice is to talk to her about it and try to understand her worries/fears/how she feels, and then apologize for not answering her emotional call. If she understands and you communicate your feelings, hopefully she can apologize (if you felt hurt by her reaction). From there you guys have a chance to work out how to better communicate to each other when one of you is asking for support (maybe a specific phrase would work, or maybe the receiver can ask \u201cis it important to you that I [do x,y,x thing]\u201d).", "YTA.
