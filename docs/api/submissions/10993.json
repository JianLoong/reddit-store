If you can\u2019t get Thursday off from work, please consider going out of your way to make sure your gf is supported. Perhaps buy some flowers and leave them as a surprise for when she gets home from the appointment. Make sure she has a heated pad ready at home by the bed or couch.

OP is a bit of an ass either way, although I don't think it's a massive infraction, they just need to communicate better", "MY God, why not schedule the appointment when he has a day off? Not one hour before he has to get to work.\n\nBut that would take some forethought and consideration for your partner.", "This was posted 4 hours ago. According to the statement below taken from the post.  She told him on Saturday that the appointment was on Thursday.  She gave him less than a week notice.  Most workplaces do not react well for time off with such little notice.\n\n\"Yesterday my (19M) gf (19F) asked me if I would go to the doctor with her on Thursday because she\u2019s getting a iud put in.\" \n\nBesides she said her Mom was available to go. It is not as though she had no one to accompany her.", "No one, except you, said his work is more important than hers. Some people are just so sexist.  Communication would have been nice............not just hey my appointment is this Thursday and you're coming with me right?  \n\nTalk about controlling....\n\nA considerate person would have consulted with her partner when scheduling the appointment for a convenient time for both of them.\n\nSheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh...............................", "[removed]", "ah yes, the IUD is to prevent her cum from getting her pregnant. Makes sense", "Who\u2019s baby is it going to be without one? It\u2019s for both of them. Or do you think a baby is only the woman\u2019s problem because it grew in her?", "If you can't put those pieces together... oof.", "My boss wouldn't care because if I chose my schedule in advance it wouldn't be an issue, but I fully understand not every job is like that. I was just saying that's what I have personally done and would do in this situation. Him wording it by saying he'd \"rather not\" because he doesn't want to POTENTIALLY be late and doesn't think the procedure is that big of a deal just feels insensitive and I understand why his girlfriend got upset is all.", "Oh, absolutely! When I was talking about horror stories I didn't just mean pain, I was talking about the people who were medically traumatized by the situation as a whole. Definitely not like a deplorable human being, just too quick to brush off his girlfriend's feelings. I hope they can resolve the issue, communicate better in the future, and that the appointment goes okay!", "It is also apparent that OP didn't know what his schedule would be. So, now that he knows, he could at least ASK. Especially if he does have PTO. It is probably easier for him to give his boss a heads up about being a little late, then for her to have to reschedule. I think it is great that Mom can go if he can't, but he should at least try. If the  answer is no after asking, then it makes sense that he not go.", "Not everyone is in a situation where there's a lot of choice around appointments like this.   \n\nShe is having a medical procedure, putting her body on the line, and having a foreign object inserted into her which will cause short term pain and discomfort and likely at least one type of long term side effect, all so her bf can ejaculate inside her without wearing a condom.  The LEAST he can do is shut up, try his best to get to the appointment, and not put up some whiny post on the internet lamenting that he has work that day.", "[removed]", "I can put it together. This is the form of bc she's chosing how is that his problem?", "Would it have hurt the girlfriend to consult with her boyfriend about when a convenient irrelevant.  Feelings are feelings.\n\nI feel like so many are very dismissive of his job issue.  Not everyone has the freedom to just be late for work without consequences.\n\nAnd the fact is truly that he would not POTENTIALLY be late but most probably late.\n\nUnless I am mistaken, OP was scheduled to start work one hour after the appointment time.\n\nWhat doctor do you know that run on time?\n\nMost doctors offices intentionally over-schedule and double book. Most doctors keep patients waiting anywhere from 20 minutes to several hours past their scheduled time.  OP would most definitely be very late without even considering travel time from the appointment to work.\n\nWould it have hurt the girlfriend to consult with her boyfriend about scheduling the appointment during his off days?", "And not everyone is in a position to risk his job for a medical appointment when there is another close family member who is available.\n\nGood God..........................", "I dunno how to explain to you that loving partners care about each other and their discomfort. Sorry my guy, being obtuse isn't as clever as you think.", "Because an IUD has the highest success rate of any form of BC except for a vasectomy, so he won\u2019t end up with unwanted kids, have to pay for a child for 18 years, and he can have sex without a condom.", "Sorry I don't think couples have to be up each other's ass?", "If she got pregnant with his kid, he could be left paying child support for 18 years. If I were him I would be pretty interested in the birth control situation. It could make an incredible difference in the next couple decades of his life.", "Okay. :)"]}
