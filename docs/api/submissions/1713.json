It was the first time by ourselves after our baby was born. It\u2019s my second child, the first for my husband so it was kind of a big deal for us. We got a babysitter and we went to a very nice fancy restaurant.\n\nA few minutes after we ordered, another couple sat on the table next to us\u2026 with a small baby in a stroller. At first it was fine but after a few minutes the baby started crying. They tried to comfort it, but every time it seemed they had managed to make it sleep, it woke up crying again.\n\nBy then we just wanted to leave but we had already ordered so we decided to ask the waiter if we could change tables to the other side of the restaurant. The waiter asked if there was a problem and I said it was our first time out after having a baby and we didn\u2019t feel like spending our evening next to someone else\u2019s crying baby. He was super nice and quickly asked another waiter to help him set up the new table for us. Another couple that was in the same area also asked to be seated elsewhere.\n\nThe couple with the baby overheard what we said to the waiter and specially the mom got upset and called me an AH. She went on and on saying that I probably don\u2019t have kids (mm.. I have 2), and that babies are also people and we should just accept that babies can be loud and cry and there\u2019s nothing she could do about it.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to start a fight or anything but I got really annoyed by her attitude, so I told her that she could actually do something about the crying.. she could take her baby home so it can properly sleep and then let everyone else there enjoy their meals.\n\nShe kept saying stuff but I just ignored her, went to our new table and tried to have a nice dinner (although we could still hear the crying baby but at least it was not right next to us). \n\nThis morning I told my sister what happened and she said she agrees that I might have been an AH. She said I shouldn\u2019t have said to the waiter that we wanted to move because of the baby and I shouldn\u2019t have said what I said to the mom. So now I am not sure??

If you had asked the waiter to have the other couple leave, then yes YWBTA. Instead,  you inconvienenced yourself, moved to a different table to enjoy your meal. Also I'd like to point out as a parent that there are places I will not take my small child to, as they do not yet have the social awareness and self control to behave.  Yes they need to learn and they can learn at less fancy places. I have turned down invites to activities because they were not at a  child friendly location and I did not have childcare.", "NTA!!! Sick of parents who don\u2019t do anything about their loud shrieking children and expect everyone else to deal with it.", "NTA.

Babies aren't 4-wheel drive vehicles. They can't go everywhere.", "NTA at all. She asked and you answered and you were correct. She already knew why you were moving since she overheard you. She was looking to pick a fight. You would have been TA if you asked the waiter to move them. Asking to be moved elsewhere was completely reasonable.", "NTA. When I was breastfeeding I would leak milk if I heard a baby cry.  \n\nI feel bad for the servers - they probably moved you into an other persons section which makes things complicated for them and sucks for them though.", "Were you having dinner at Chuckie Cheese? If no, NTA.", "NTA. Especially if this was a fancy restaurant. Bringing a baby/ small child out? Cool! Chain restaurants? Good. Kid- geared restaurants? Even better. Fancy restaurants? No. Not appropriate for babies or small children that do not have the capacity to self regulate. You didn\u2019t even make a big deal out of it, you just wanted to be moved so you could enjoy your meal and have an adult conversation without a baby screaming next to you. Why that mom took you guys moving so offensively is beyond me. You would THINK that she would understand that not everyone wants to be near a screaming baby while they eat.

Its expensive to eat out.\n\n\n\n\nWe learned quickly that our baby would not tolerate even an early dinner out of the house when we took her for our first meal out to our very local Greek restaurant.  As usual we were there when they opened for dinner at 5pm and the owners warmly welcomed us in.  The minute our food was served, my infant started crying.  Everything was tried to calm her down, even Greek grandma walked around soothing & singing lullabies.  \nNope. \n\nShe was the type of baby who needed to be home by 5pm at the latest.  No biggie, we'd just go out to lunch instead. But at least we tried it out in a very empty restaurant where we were well known. \n\n\nShe's grown now and we still laugh about her 5pm hard limit (during her first 8ish years).

In a proper restaurant, hell no, either take the baby out to soothe it or if that doesn\u2019t work, go home! I still remember dragging a screaming toddler out of Tescos (because she wanted sweets and was told no) and waiting for my husband outside.

The other mother should have taken her kid outside when it became noisy.", "NTA and I\u2019m really not sure why comments say you shouldn\u2019t have responded to someone who literally called you an AH.

She could have chosen to pretend she didn\u2019t overhear you and got on with her own meal as everyone is suggesting you should have. Especially considering she clearly only bothered to listen to the part that antagonised her and not the part where you also have a baby and this was your first time away from them. \n\nYou could have been nicer in your response but the situation could have been left as it was with no need for any discussion whatsoever. You don\u2019t need any reason to leave any situation you are uncomfortable with and it was rude of her to basically insist you had to put up with it. It\u2019s also incredibly entitled to think that a room full of people who have also come out for a nice dinner should have to just accept it because that\u2019s what you want.", "Nta. No one wants to sit next to a crying baby. You did the right thing to ask the waiter to move.

You dont insult the mother or the baby, you don't wanna spend all dinner with a cru baby in the back. \nShe was disrespectfull when she Talk to you the way she was, and you respont to her then.", "NTA, but actually kids can go to fancy restaurants. If they make a disturbance, the parent takes the child outside until it behaved. I", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA Totally understandable that you are parents looking for a little adult time. I don't think you should have suggested the other Mother go home, but you already realized that. She should not have called you an AH", "NTA. You were not happy sitting where you were and asked to have your table moved. You did not ask the parents to silence their baby or to move their table.  \n\nI dont see how you are in the wrong asking to move tables.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to be subjected to a crying infant after attempting to escape your own for the evening. You were polite by asking to be reseated. The other mom decided to involve herself and start a pointless interaction. Could you have kept it moving without interacting with that mom? Sure. You didn\u2019t say anything horrible. Horrible would be behaving like you\u2019re completely unhinged, ie getting close to the baby\u2019s face and yelling to STFU, calling the parents shitty people for having the audacity to bring an infant to a fancy establishment, or putting the waitstaff in the middle of things past your initial interaction with the mom. You did nothing of the sort. You kept it moving, and there was no reason for the mom to continue speaking about the folks that moved away from their table afterwards. \n\nI hope you got to enjoy your dinner after all of that.\n\nETA: you mentioning the reason was important. If two couples randomly requested to be moved out of a particular server\u2019s section, management might think that the servers behavior was to blame. By telling them the reason, you might have saved the server from getting in trouble for something that wasn\u2019t their fault. You didn\u2019t approach the waiter and say I need to be reseated due to the crying baby. You only provided your reasoning after you were asked if there was a problem. You weren\u2019t trying to start anything, and the only person who decided to blow everything out of proportion was the other mom.", "NTA. I think all the e-s-h votes think you started shit with the other table but from this telling it seems like you were lowkey about it and didn\u2019t intend to start problems. Parents shouldn\u2019t be vilified for their children\u2019s actions but you didn\u2019t do anything to make the parents villains in this case. They decided to interact and create an issue. It sounds like this is a formal space and you\u2019re totally within your rights to ask for a quieter place. They were able to accommodate and it doesn\u2019t sound like it was that big of a deal for the server since they were able to do it for another table as well.", "Nta", "NTA I\u2019m a mom of a toddler. My husband and I order in all the time for date night because she goes to bed at 7:30 and then we can have a special dinner and don\u2019t have to pay for a baby sitter and we\u2019re not being inconsiderate AHs. I would have moved too. It\u2019s not an airplane or public travel situation. That mom was probably feeling a touch of embarrassment (at least I hope she was) and then she tried to double down after it was very apparent people were annoyed.", "I don't fault you for that at all. NTA. You went to a restaurant for a nice evening out with your husband w/out kids. It's entirely reasonable for you to ask for a quieter spot. Just like when back in the day there were smoking and non-smoking sections (as if they worked, but whatever). The mother of that baby should have just kept quiet, I don't think it was proper of her to get upset with you. So no, my two cents, you are not the AH in this situation.", "NTA. As a mom of three girls 5,7, & 1 I totally agree with you. On the rare chance my husband and I are child free for a night I don\u2019t want to go somewhere and listen to someone else\u2019s child. You didn\u2019t attack the couple, you didn\u2019t ask management to make them leave, and you didn\u2019t insult them when you asked to switch tables. Based on your telling of the events all you did was remove yourself from a situation you weren\u2019t enjoying.

The world does not have to tolerate sitting near a screaming baby. Something similar happened to me\u2014I needed a break from my infant son so badly that I bought a pizza and rented movies for my babysitter and paid her twice what I normally did so that I could step out for maybe two hours, enjoy a beer and a cheap plate of nachos. When I moved away from the baby-table, the mom accused me of not having kids and not understanding. That two hours were so expensive for a single mother just to have peace that I kind of unloaded on her, telling her just how much money I spent just for two hours of peace that night. I told her not to judge others, too, for she doesn\u2019t know their situation (what if someone had a miscarriage, a failed IVF, or something else that might not make them feel comfortable near a difficult-to-tune-out child?).\n\nNTA, and that mother shouldn\u2019t have approached and accosted you for simply wanting to move tables.", "NTA.

Parents used to understand that!", "I have the expectation that when I go out for a very rare fancy schmancy dinner with my partner, I'm not only paying for the food. I'm also paying for an experience and part of that experience  doesn't include listening to a baby howl nonstop. I don't have the same expectations of a casual family type restaurant, of course. I'm glad that your waiter quickly rectified the situation but sorry that your date night included dealing with a self-entitled asshole. NTA.", "NTA. If they really couldn\u2019t get a babysitter the proper thing to do is whisk the kid outside everytime they start crying", "NTA.

Honestly, I think parents appreciate not hearing a baby cry more than most. I had four kids. Those nights out without the kids were precious! You weren\u2019t rude, and you have the right to enjoy your night out.", "Absolutely NTA.  I've done the same thing.  I only get to go out to dinner like twice a year and I don't want to listen to a screaming and/or crying child while I'm trying to enjoy a rare meal out.\n\nThis woman is the type of parent who thinks their child should be everyone's responsibility to put up with.  She has zero consideration for anyone but herself.  These are the worst kind of parent and it sounds like your sister is of the same mentality.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nI work in a restaurant, and not even a very classy one at that. And yet, most people still have the common courtesy not to bring their babies. If they do, they make sure the baby stays quiet.

It\u2019s an Italian cafe that only serves desserts coffee and cocktails. Safe to say, it\u2019s not a place for children. There was this couple there with their infant that had to maybe a month old. It was screaming the entire time and even exploded diarrhea. THEY DIDNT LEAVE. So not to mention seeing that while trying to enjoy a dessert and cocktail and hearing the fucking cried of the little asshat our waitress didn\u2019t great us for 25 min. We asked 4 ppl if we can place an order. As a server, I have never not tipped. Our bill was $26.22. I left $26.22. But the kid shat on themselves and they just wiped it up dripping shit all over the floor.", "NTA would've been smarter to just ignore the mom though", "NTA.

Part of that choice is responsibly taking care of those children, not bringing them along everywhere you go whether it is appropriate or not for them to be there.  Get babysitters, or stay home.\n\nSee also:\n\n* theaters of any kind.  Movie, live theater, concerts, etc.\n* shopping with both parents and a carload of kids, when one parent could stay home with the kids\n* Bringing your kids with you anywhere at all in public when it is hours past their normal bedtime.  I see people at 24/7 grocery stores, for example, with kids who likely should have been asleep for 4 hours or more.", "NTA\n\nWhen that couple realized that their baby was disturbing others, the right thing to do was to take the baby out of the restaurant and give it what it needed. Instead they let the baby continue to fuss and bother the people around them. They are probably the kind of people who take their baby to an R rated movie and refuse to leave when the baby cries. If it was a family oriented place, I would be more inclined to cut them some Slack. But at an upscale restaurant, people aren't going there to hear a baby scream while they try to enjoy their expensive meal.\n\nDoubly rude for them to call you out when they found out you were moving away from them. Selfish, entitled, and obnoxious. You weren't hurting them and had every right to want to be moved away from their little noise maker.

This is just selfish behaviour - why do they get a baby if they aren\u2019t willing to to live as they have a baby?", "NTA\n\nYou respectfully asked your waiter to love tables, not harassed a mom for not being able to quiet her baby.\n\nAlso, not all spaces are child friendly and that is ok!

And it's really stressful to watch because it just reminds you that having kids is going to be terrible during many moments. Even if it's wonderful, it's also terrible. And it's always really scary to think that they've chosen that over just being at home, because being at home is apparently worse. Like I understand not wanting to cook, but getting takeout and letting your kid crawl around the living room has to be better than trying to force them into a high chair.

Structure and Routine are the names of God when it comes to children ages newborn to adolescence. A small baby shouldn't be taken out to dinner in a setting like that and should be at home. A family gathering or dinner is one thing, but I do feel it's rude behavior to bring the baby there given the context and dismissive of the comfort and needs of their own child. I get it.

It's \\*annoying\\* when children cry, but children \\*do\\* exist, and I don't think it's reasonable to think that parents of young children should never let them out of the house or never go to a restaurant. I think it's annoying when people talk loudly about sports or finance. I think lots of people's conversations are annoying and distracting, honestly, but when you're in public, you will sometimes have to deal with other people being annoying. Babies exist. Parents can't always get (or afford) a baby-sitter. Sometimes babies will cry. Annoying? Yes. \n\nOP asked to move tables, which was a totally reasonable thing to do.

If I have a family-friendly restaurant, I don't want my customers telling other customers what they believe the rules are, especially if they aren't rules I want to enforce.\n\nIt sounds like this restaurant was okay with it, meaning OP should take her business elsewhere and likely exaggerated about it being \"fancy\"", "It's rude to fight in a restaurant.

I had very long hair at one point. I swear to God there was a time period where little kids kept touching my hair if they were in a booth near me.

My friend had seen it happen so often she stood up for me when people started calling me a jerk.\n\nMost of the time parents were mortified and apologized, but some just let it keep going on.

I appreciated the apologies, but I just wanted to eat in peace.", "The rude mother inflamed the situation, not OP.", "Seems to me the irresponsible mother is the one pouring oil.

I'm sure if that baby slept through dinner or even calmed down after fussing the first time around nobody would complain", "> Is the assumption that parents of babies might not *also* want to have a nice experience or celebrate a special occasion?\n\nThen get a sitter. Having children is a choice, you don\u2019t get to impose costs on everyone else.  \n\nBecause that\u2019s literally the issue here: two parents indulging their desire for a fancy night out but who can\u2019t be bothered to responsibly hire a sitter \u2026 at the cost of several dozen adults (many of whom, btw, have responsibly arranged for a sitter for their own children) having their evening ruined by screaming. \n\nHaving children is a choice that comes with costs. One of those costs is avoiding environments that are unsuitable for babies for a few years, unless you make arrangements for child care. \n\n> I don't think it's reasonable to think that parents of young children should never let them out of the house or never go to a restaurant. \n\nWho on earth suggested that? There\u2019s a world of difference between going to a Chili\u2019s or Cheesecake Factory (both 100% family friendly) and going out to a fine dining establishment. \n\nYes, you can take babies to restaurants (provided you take them outside when they scream/cry). No, you should not take them to fancy restaurants - and you\u2019re always an asshole if you do. \n\nWhat is difficult about this concept? If the parents want to go see a horror movie, should they bring the baby because, well, they want to see it? If they want to go to an opera, should they bring the baby and let it scream throughout the performance? \n\nNo one said that parents should never bring babies to restaurants - only that they should refrain from bringing them to fancy restaurants, and should remove them from a restaurant if they start screeching."]}
