It was the first time by ourselves after our baby was born. It\u2019s my second child, the first for my husband so it was kind of a big deal for us. We got a babysitter and we went to a very nice fancy restaurant.\n\nA few minutes after we ordered, another couple sat on the table next to us\u2026 with a small baby in a stroller. At first it was fine but after a few minutes the baby started crying. They tried to comfort it, but every time it seemed they had managed to make it sleep, it woke up crying again.\n\nBy then we just wanted to leave but we had already ordered so we decided to ask the waiter if we could change tables to the other side of the restaurant. The waiter asked if there was a problem and I said it was our first time out after having a baby and we didn\u2019t feel like spending our evening next to someone else\u2019s crying baby. He was super nice and quickly asked another waiter to help him set up the new table for us. Another couple that was in the same area also asked to be seated elsewhere.\n\nThe couple with the baby overheard what we said to the waiter and specially the mom got upset and called me an AH. She went on and on saying that I probably don\u2019t have kids (mm.. I have 2), and that babies are also people and we should just accept that babies can be loud and cry and there\u2019s nothing she could do about it.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to start a fight or anything but I got really annoyed by her attitude, so I told her that she could actually do something about the crying.. she could take her baby home so it can properly sleep and then let everyone else there enjoy their meals.\n\nShe kept saying stuff but I just ignored her, went to our new table and tried to have a nice dinner (although we could still hear the crying baby but at least it was not right next to us). \n\nThis morning I told my sister what happened and she said she agrees that I might have been an AH. She said I shouldn\u2019t have said to the waiter that we wanted to move because of the baby and I shouldn\u2019t have said what I said to the mom. So now I am not sure??

If you had asked the waiter to have the other couple leave, then yes YWBTA. Instead,  you inconvienenced yourself, moved to a different table to enjoy your meal. Also I'd like to point out as a parent that there are places I will not take my small child to, as they do not yet have the social awareness and self control to behave.  Yes they need to learn and they can learn at less fancy places. I have turned down invites to activities because they were not at a  child friendly location and I did not have childcare.", "NTA!!! Sick of parents who don\u2019t do anything about their loud shrieking children and expect everyone else to deal with it.", "NTA.

Babies aren't 4-wheel drive vehicles. They can't go everywhere.", "NTA at all. She asked and you answered and you were correct. She already knew why you were moving since she overheard you. She was looking to pick a fight. You would have been TA if you asked the waiter to move them. Asking to be moved elsewhere was completely reasonable.", "NTA. When I was breastfeeding I would leak milk if I heard a baby cry.  \n\nI feel bad for the servers - they probably moved you into an other persons section which makes things complicated for them and sucks for them though.", "Were you having dinner at Chuckie Cheese? If no, NTA.", "NTA. Especially if this was a fancy restaurant. Bringing a baby/ small child out? Cool! Chain restaurants? Good. Kid- geared restaurants? Even better. Fancy restaurants? No. Not appropriate for babies or small children that do not have the capacity to self regulate. You didn\u2019t even make a big deal out of it, you just wanted to be moved so you could enjoy your meal and have an adult conversation without a baby screaming next to you. Why that mom took you guys moving so offensively is beyond me. You would THINK that she would understand that not everyone wants to be near a screaming baby while they eat.

Its expensive to eat out.\n\n\n\n\nWe learned quickly that our baby would not tolerate even an early dinner out of the house when we took her for our first meal out to our very local Greek restaurant.  As usual we were there when they opened for dinner at 5pm and the owners warmly welcomed us in.  The minute our food was served, my infant started crying.  Everything was tried to calm her down, even Greek grandma walked around soothing & singing lullabies.  \nNope. \n\nShe was the type of baby who needed to be home by 5pm at the latest.  No biggie, we'd just go out to lunch instead. But at least we tried it out in a very empty restaurant where we were well known. \n\n\nShe's grown now and we still laugh about her 5pm hard limit (during her first 8ish years).

In a proper restaurant, hell no, either take the baby out to soothe it or if that doesn\u2019t work, go home! I still remember dragging a screaming toddler out of Tescos (because she wanted sweets and was told no) and waiting for my husband outside.

The other mother should have taken her kid outside when it became noisy.", "NTA and I\u2019m really not sure why comments say you shouldn\u2019t have responded to someone who literally called you an AH.

She could have chosen to pretend she didn\u2019t overhear you and got on with her own meal as everyone is suggesting you should have. Especially considering she clearly only bothered to listen to the part that antagonised her and not the part where you also have a baby and this was your first time away from them. \n\nYou could have been nicer in your response but the situation could have been left as it was with no need for any discussion whatsoever. You don\u2019t need any reason to leave any situation you are uncomfortable with and it was rude of her to basically insist you had to put up with it. It\u2019s also incredibly entitled to think that a room full of people who have also come out for a nice dinner should have to just accept it because that\u2019s what you want.", "Nta. No one wants to sit next to a crying baby. You did the right thing to ask the waiter to move. If the mother was upset that people don't want to be around her crying child that is her problem.", "NTA... You did the right thing by letting the Waiter know why you wanted to change tables.

Not your fault if she overheard your conversation.", "NTA - I won't sit anywhere near a child if I can help it, and I will also move if a child sits next too me.", "NTA. You dont insult the mother or the baby, you don't wanna spend all dinner with a cru baby in the back. \nShe was disrespectfull when she Talk to you the way she was, and you respont to her then.", "NTA, but actually kids can go to fancy restaurants. If they make a disturbance, the parent takes the child outside until it behaved. I", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA Totally understandable that you are parents looking for a little adult time. I don't think you should have suggested the other Mother go home, but you already realized that. She should not have called you an AH", "NTA. You were not happy sitting where you were and asked to have your table moved. You did not ask the parents to silence their baby or to move their table.  \n\nI dont see how you are in the wrong asking to move tables.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to be subjected to a crying infant after attempting to escape your own for the evening. You were polite by asking to be reseated. The other mom decided to involve herself and start a pointless interaction. Could you have kept it moving without interacting with that mom? Sure. You didn\u2019t say anything horrible. Horrible would be behaving like you\u2019re completely unhinged, ie getting close to the baby\u2019s face and yelling to STFU, calling the parents shitty people for having the audacity to bring an infant to a fancy establishment, or putting the waitstaff in the middle of things past your initial interaction with the mom. You did nothing of the sort. You kept it moving, and there was no reason for the mom to continue speaking about the folks that moved away from their table afterwards. \n\nI hope you got to enjoy your dinner after all of that.\n\nETA: you mentioning the reason was important. If two couples randomly requested to be moved out of a particular server\u2019s section, management might think that the servers behavior was to blame. By telling them the reason, you might have saved the server from getting in trouble for something that wasn\u2019t their fault. You didn\u2019t approach the waiter and say I need to be reseated due to the crying baby. You only provided your reasoning after you were asked if there was a problem. You weren\u2019t trying to start anything, and the only person who decided to blow everything out of proportion was the other mom.", "NTA. I think all the e-s-h votes think you started shit with the other table but from this telling it seems like you were lowkey about it and didn\u2019t intend to start problems. Parents shouldn\u2019t be vilified for their children\u2019s actions but you didn\u2019t do anything to make the parents villains in this case. They decided to interact and create an issue. It sounds like this is a formal space and you\u2019re totally within your rights to ask for a quieter place. They were able to accommodate and it doesn\u2019t sound like it was that big of a deal for the server since they were able to do it for another table as well.", "Nta", "NTA I\u2019m a mom of a toddler. My husband and I order in all the time for date night because she goes to bed at 7:30 and then we can have a special dinner and don\u2019t have to pay for a baby sitter and we\u2019re not being inconsiderate AHs. I would have moved too. It\u2019s not an airplane or public travel situation. That mom was probably feeling a touch of embarrassment (at least I hope she was) and then she tried to double down after it was very apparent people were annoyed.", "I don't fault you for that at all. NTA. You went to a restaurant for a nice evening out with your husband w/out kids. It's entirely reasonable for you to ask for a quieter spot. Just like when back in the day there were smoking and non-smoking sections (as if they worked, but whatever). The mother of that baby should have just kept quiet, I don't think it was proper of her to get upset with you. So no, my two cents, you are not the AH in this situation.", "NTA. As a mom of three girls 5,7, & 1 I totally agree with you. On the rare chance my husband and I are child free for a night I don\u2019t want to go somewhere and listen to someone else\u2019s child. You didn\u2019t attack the couple, you didn\u2019t ask management to make them leave, and you didn\u2019t insult them when you asked to switch tables. Based on your telling of the events all you did was remove yourself from a situation you weren\u2019t enjoying.

The world does not have to tolerate sitting near a screaming baby. Something similar happened to me\u2014I needed a break from my infant son so badly that I bought a pizza and rented movies for my babysitter and paid her twice what I normally did so that I could step out for maybe two hours, enjoy a beer and a cheap plate of nachos. When I moved away from the baby-table, the mom accused me of not having kids and not understanding. That two hours were so expensive for a single mother just to have peace that I kind of unloaded on her, telling her just how much money I spent just for two hours of peace that night. I told her not to judge others, too, for she doesn\u2019t know their situation (what if someone had a miscarriage, a failed IVF, or something else that might not make them feel comfortable near a difficult-to-tune-out child?).\n\nNTA, and that mother shouldn\u2019t have approached and accosted you for simply wanting to move tables.", "NTA.

I\u2019m sorry but you shouldn\u2019t be takin your baby to such a fancy place anyway. You wanna eat out and take the little one? Go to McDonald\u2019s or sit outside or some shit. Get a sitter. It\u2019s a baby. They aren\u2019t gonna be upset you didn\u2019t take them to Red Lobster", "Nta. You were absolutely within your rights to ask to be moved.

You were absolutely right and telling the waiter why was reasonable.  The restaurant should have a policy whereby no customer can have a meal there if they intrude on others\u2019 peaceful enjoyment. \n\nThere are restaurants where having a child present is expected and accommodated.

Parents used to understand that!", "I have the expectation that when I go out for a very rare fancy schmancy dinner with my partner, I'm not only paying for the food. I'm also paying for an experience and part of that experience  doesn't include listening to a baby howl nonstop. I don't have the same expectations of a casual family type restaurant, of course. I'm glad that your waiter quickly rectified the situation but sorry that your date night included dealing with a self-entitled asshole. NTA.", "NTA. If they really couldn\u2019t get a babysitter the proper thing to do is whisk the kid outside everytime they start crying", "NTA.

She can't expect people in her vicinity to be perfectly okay with all things child-related, even in their own time and space!", "NTA. Honestly, I think parents appreciate not hearing a baby cry more than most. I had four kids. Those nights out without the kids were precious! You weren\u2019t rude, and you have the right to enjoy your night out.", "Absolutely NTA.  I've done the same thing.  I only get to go out to dinner like twice a year and I don't want to listen to a screaming and/or crying child while I'm trying to enjoy a rare meal out.\n\nThis woman is the type of parent who thinks their child should be everyone's responsibility to put up with.  She has zero consideration for anyone but herself.  These are the worst kind of parent and it sounds like your sister is of the same mentality.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nI work in a restaurant, and not even a very classy one at that. And yet, most people still have the common courtesy not to bring their babies. If they do, they make sure the baby stays quiet.

It\u2019s an Italian cafe that only serves desserts coffee and cocktails. Safe to say, it\u2019s not a place for children. There was this couple there with their infant that had to maybe a month old. It was screaming the entire time and even exploded diarrhea. THEY DIDNT LEAVE. So not to mention seeing that while trying to enjoy a dessert and cocktail and hearing the fucking cried of the little asshat our waitress didn\u2019t great us for 25 min. We asked 4 ppl if we can place an order. As a server, I have never not tipped. Our bill was $26.22. I left $26.22. But the kid shat on themselves and they just wiped it up dripping shit all over the floor.", "NTA would've been smarter to just ignore the mom though", "NTA.

Part of that choice is responsibly taking care of those children, not bringing them along everywhere you go whether it is appropriate or not for them to be there.  Get babysitters, or stay home.\n\nSee also:\n\n* theaters of any kind.  Movie, live theater, concerts, etc.\n* shopping with both parents and a carload of kids, when one parent could stay home with the kids\n* Bringing your kids with you anywhere at all in public when it is hours past their normal bedtime.  I see people at 24/7 grocery stores, for example, with kids who likely should have been asleep for 4 hours or more.", "NTA\n\nWhen that couple realized that their baby was disturbing others, the right thing to do was to take the baby out of the restaurant and give it what it needed. Instead they let the baby continue to fuss and bother the people around them. They are probably the kind of people who take their baby to an R rated movie and refuse to leave when the baby cries. If it was a family oriented place, I would be more inclined to cut them some Slack. But at an upscale restaurant, people aren't going there to hear a baby scream while they try to enjoy their expensive meal.\n\nDoubly rude for them to call you out when they found out you were moving away from them. Selfish, entitled, and obnoxious. You weren't hurting them and had every right to want to be moved away from their little noise maker.

This is just selfish behaviour - why do they get a baby if they aren\u2019t willing to to live as they have a baby?", "NTA\n\nYou respectfully asked your waiter to love tables, not harassed a mom for not being able to quiet her baby.\n\nAlso, not all spaces are child friendly and that is ok!

And it's really stressful to watch because it just reminds you that having kids is going to be terrible during many moments. Even if it's wonderful, it's also terrible. And it's always really scary to think that they've chosen that over just being at home, because being at home is apparently worse. Like I understand not wanting to cook, but getting takeout and letting your kid crawl around the living room has to be better than trying to force them into a high chair.

Structure and Routine are the names of God when it comes to children ages newborn to adolescence. A small baby shouldn't be taken out to dinner in a setting like that and should be at home. A family gathering or dinner is one thing, but I do feel it's rude behavior to bring the baby there given the context and dismissive of the comfort and needs of their own child. I get it.

With two adults you can have one take a kid outside briefly until they chill out, and try again.  I would not make it pleasant for them so they would not act up just to get out. Not that they would get punished, but they wouldn't get rewarded with fast food and time in an arcade and a trip to the park. Just go home, have a normal meal/restaurant leftovers/etc.  Also would not take them to a very nice place where people were having special/nice times. They can do casual fast chain stuff to learn manners.\n\nMy child rearing techniques should not infringe on the enjoyment of others in a place where they are expected to have a good meal.  In a place where kids are expected to be there, even be noisy (fast food/Chuck E Cheese type stuff) then it isn't as strict. But NTA for asking to be moved. Not like you asked them to be removed from the restaurant! They should have done that themselves, or one parent until the kid calmed down.", "NTA", "Nta-i'm an empty nester and do the same thing at fancy places.

Note other's did the same, The mother in question lashed out at you because she knew people were PISSED at her.

Of course it does, it's not a pleasant sound. Wanting to not be by a crying baby isn't a personal attack.", "NTA. Some parents have a very entitled behavior when it comes to their kids. Disruptions at a restaurant are equally annoying no matter whether it\u2019s a kid or an adult - no one tolerates screaming adults in a restaurant. You\u2019d want to move in that case too.

At least not without one of us constantly holding her. \n\nLuckily, with months of intense rehab, she is a functioning member of our dinner party now. \n\nKidding, but not really.

It's basic respect.  And we apologized, rather than attacked, anyone that noticed.\n\n**That person didn't have basic respect for the others** in the building.  \n\nThe mom was rude **to** you.   The manager ought to have stepped in between her and you, when that mother began to attack you.  You were verbally attacked, in a public place, because you objected to someone else's rude behavior.  You weren't standing up and accusing her, **you were talking privately to your waiter**, to have your experience be what was reasonably expected.   In restaurants, it's expected that one politely pretends not to hear what other people say to the waitstaff.  **She didn't politely ignore your conversation, she put herself into it.**  She didn't admit that her child was in need of her attention and remove the child from the situation, as polite parents would do.  She didn't solve the problem for the child, by tending to the child's needs.  **SHE did wrong, and wanted you to approve it, and was angry that you objected.  She verbally attacked you.**  \n\nWhen someone verbally attacks you, in a time and place you have no warning in advance, it's reasonable that you won't react with the best possible words.  The truth is, you told the truth.  She could have made a choice to do something else.  She could have acknowledged her responsibility to the others in the restaurant, and that her child was disturbing others.  She could have acted politely and not invaded your conversation with the waitstaff.   And **you did just walk away and ignore her, as quickly as you could.**  You were \"boots on the ground\" here, and under attack.  I could think up a great response, in about three days after just reading this, but you were there, in the middle of her words, trying to have a nice date night.  **You did fine.  Polite people would have been nodding and agreeing with you, not her, if it would have been polite for them to do so.**", "NTA. I absolutely loathed going to restaurants on date night and being seated next to kids.

The mother should have been fine with that.", "NTA.\n\nI don't mind that they took their baby to the fancy restaurant. I don't mind that it cried. Where they become assholes is when they complain about the very expected reactions that don't harm them or inconvenience them at all. You didn't even say anything rude, they just took offense because you weren't going to sit next to them. \n\nNow, quite honestly, it does sound like they made a poor decision bringing the child to that sort of establishment, but since it was obviously OK with the restaurant then I can't blame them for it. But they certainly can keep their mouths shut when others give them space, that's out of line.", "Your sister is mistaken.

Firmly NTA.", "NTA. I always say that if I have a drink in my hand I do NOT want to hear children.", "NTA - It was none of the other couple's business why you wanted to change tables.

You didn't yell at the other parents or make a scene, you simply asked to move to another table.  Nothing asshole about this.  \n\nIt's not the child's fault - not if they are young enough to be in a stroller, its the fault of the parents.  If, as a parent, you choose to bring your very young child to a restaurant, you damn well better be prepared to leave if the child starts disturbing other diners.", "NTA. I have over a decade of experience working in the restaurant industry, and parents who simply let their child cry for the duration of the meal are some of the worst guests. No one expects silence out of a baby, but if it\u2019s not possible to soothe them within a few minutes the courteous thing to do is to walk away from other diners. \nThe child is crying because they need something! Being in an unfamiliar environment where the parents can\u2019t or won\u2019t address that need only makes the situation worse for the baby.", "Nta if the restaurant is higher up you don\u2019t bring babies who\u2019ll cry and cause a fuss. Lower ones i would expect it, however upper scale I wouldn\u2019t want to sit by a crying baby either.", "NTA - a crying baby wants help, not to be left crying, so the parents were failing there already.  You went out specifically to have a break from the kids and they should have got a sitter too if they weren't going to attempt to comfort their child or at least take him/her for a walk away from the diners.  That mom invited your retort.", "My mom would remove herself and me entirely from situations. No one wants to hear screaming babies/toddlers/kids. Even the parents. That's why parents try so hard to, you know... make it stop. LOL", "NTA. I have a child, and have done exactly the same thing when my husband and I were able to go to dinner without our child. I got a dirty look from a mother of 4 who was seated right next to us, but I don\u2019t care. I also have been the mom of a young child in a restaurant\u2026and if he needed to go, I took him out. Simple as that. No reason to ruin everyone else\u2019s meals.", "NTA because regardless of you having children or not, constant crying is nerve racking and you don't have to subject yourself to that, be it at a fancy place or at a crappy one. That is considering you didn't speak to them directly nor spoke in a louder voice just to make yourself heard.\n\nI just don't get people saying children shouldn't go to restaurants. They can absolutely go and slowly be taught how to behave. And parents have to be aware that if things go sour, they may have to cut the meal short. I've taken my kids to restaurants, fancy or not, ever since they were babies. In fact my daughter was just a few months old when we went to the only Michelin star restaurant in the city we lived to celebrate my FILs birthday.

Part of me says NTA because they could have gotten a babysitter too but.. the other part of me says yes you are the a-hole!  Not everyone can afford going out to eat AND a babysitter; maybe they had a special anniversary and their babysitter cancelled on them and there was nothing they could do; maybe they have NO family in the area, new to area and didn't know anyone to call; sounds like a first child (you only mentioned one baby) and they are new parents or they got a babysitter for any older kids but the babysitter didn't want to watch an infant; maybe the baby is normally not like this and they wanted to include the baby in the celebration.  \n\nCrying babies or toddlers is LIFE - we have had this several times and while it's annoying, my hubby and I smile because we've been there and we also realize how fast it goes by (mine are now 31 and 29). We should be uplifting other women and parents up, not necessarily \"take care of the baby\" for them but be gracious and bit more understanding!", "NTA\n\nThe reality is crying babies are crying because they are alerting/trying to get attention.

I remember my first time out with my husband after out baby was born. Even thoigh my child wasn't a cry-baby or particularly difficult, we did have our challenges. That made a day away from the baby very important, esp. For my mental health. So if i were seated right next to the crying baby, i'd do the same to protect myself, not to be an asshole to the mom.\n3. I understand mom was upset, but she could expect that when taking her baby with them. And it's not like u went \"can you shut that baby up\" or anything. She is probably frustrated with the baby too, but shouldn't be taking that out on you. I have been in her shoes, so i get it, really, but she just shouldn't talk to you that way!", "NTA at all!!! i used to do this a lot as a server and parents never minded when someone wanted to move lol. they\u2019d always be like omg so sorry. sometimes we don\u2019t want to sit next to baby either (as a JOKE, don\u2019t come for those randos lol). often they\u2019d request a table in the back corner to NOT bother people. the only people who were assholes to us servers and random guests were the assholes who let their kids run around the restaurant.", "NTA. 2 of my 3 are toddlers, and we have a rule about eating out- when either has a meltdown that can't be resolved at table, we immediately get our order to go. One parent takes the kids to the car, the other waits on the food and pays, and we always leave a full tip regardless of where we are in the meal. That's because as parents and food service employees, unruly children are the bane of our existence. I can't count how many times I've almost tripped over someone's screaming little pork dumpling with a tray of hot food because they threw themselves down in a walkway or point of egress and mom and dad can't be bothered. I've also had kids tear up a host stand, or back in grocery retail, it was kids throwing stuff over shelves from one aisle to the next or walking on the conveyor belt. \n\nPoint is, people need to learn to control their kids. No one expects a baby to stop crying on demand, it's on mom and dad to say- \"time to go\", plan around the kid's schedule, get a sitter, or stay home. It's rough having young kids but that's part of the sacrifice you make when you have them.", "NTA", "NTA.

Our babies were being quiet and not fussy at all. This family with two teen girls were seated next to us. I'm not sure why because the restaurant was not very full at that time.

I think everyone can relate to sitting down to a meal out and having a crying baby or an unruly child disrupt a meal that should have been a pleasant experience.  Even the parents experience this with their own children that are normally fine and no issue at all.

I've never asked to be moved because it just seems like one of those things out of our control.  Sometimes I can tolerate it well and other times I get annoyed.  Maybe next time, you can \"put salve on the wound\", as my mother taught me, and say something nice and comforting to an upset person. \"I'm sorry your little one is upset.  That happens. I know, because I am a mother, too, and you know, mothers have an instinct to react to cries and do something, so I'm having trouble focusing on my husband.  I'm sorry you are offended, but I hope you can be understanding and have a nice meal.\"  It's like an experiment.

I\u2019m pretty tolerant at fast/fast casual places or kid\u2019s matinees as long as I see the parents making some effort - but it does get old fast when you are paying a pretty penny for a nice evening and someone\u2019s kid disrupts it.", "My kids learned very quickly that there just happens to be a timeout wall in every single bathroom in every single restaurant.", "Also jumping back in to advocate for continuing education for older kids.
