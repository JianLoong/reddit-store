You could have also helped for most of the day, but just taken a couple of hours for your friends birthday. The fact that your wife asked means that she needed you. Technically, you were entitled to that day, but you just showed your wife that she shouldn't rely on you. That's is going to cost you down the line in your marriage.\n\nYou are not fully sharing in the mental load in your marriage. I urge you to read [this comic](https://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/). It does a brilliant job explaining it.\n\nI am also concerned about your wife's cleaning. A tear down and steam clean twice a month is too much. Once a year would be enough. This isn't being particular. This is being obsessive.\n\nShe should not be tidying up your older kids rooms. It is time for them to do that. They should also be cleaning their own rooms to help lighten loads.\n\nHowever, are correct that the 17 year old should not be treated as a default baby sitter. If they agree and you pay them, fine, but children should not be parentified.", "INFO: Maybe I missed this, but who does the nighttime feedings with the baby?", "YTA for allowing you 14 and 17 year old to accumulate 6 bags of garbage in their room.   \n\nYTA for thinking cleaning up after a toddler and newborn every day without the support of your husband is not a hassle.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for not rearranging your plans for your \u201cme\u201d day.   It sounds like you would have understood if your wife skipped the deep clean that day and just did the minimum needed while caring for your two babies, and you could have pitched in during the week to catch up on the other stuff.", "Yta", "YTA. You have said what you do around the house and it sounds like very little compared to your wife. You clean the kitchen, clean up dog mess and garden.  You both cook. She does everything else. So cleaning up/laundry/bedmaking/cleaning for 6 people, 2 of whom are messy teenagers. And she gave birth 5 weeks ago, so presumably she is doing this on much reduced sleep. This is really not the time to be sticking to your normal chore division. She is healing.\n\n I don't think you are wrong for going out, but I think you should have done the washing, bed making, bathroom cleaning before you went. And don't tell your wife your kids could do more.  Tell your kids. They should be doing their own laundry, making their beds, cleaning their rooms and putting their trash in the trash.", "I am not assigning AH. Your wife does not get a day off, ever. What you are not getting, is that her saying \"fine\" is her way of disengaging from you, not relying on you, expecting you to do your bare minimum. Then, you take time off when she does not get any time off.   \n\n\nYou have four kids, wife, dog, house. You do not get \"me\" time.", "YTA (I'm not sure if you're a woman or a man but it doesn't matter.)\n\nDo you know why so many partners \"like things done a certain way?\" Often it's because they're the ones stuck doing it early on so they get set in their routines. Your wife needs to accept that you might not do things her way but will get them done. Don't purposefully do it sloppily and say \"see, I tried to help, you won't let me!\" because I see that happen in couples ALL the time (I treat couples and postpartum moms pretty frequently, this is a theme). The older kids need to do more, I agree with you there, but it sounds like you've let this stuff get out of control and that's half on you. \n\nWith kids, you never get a day off without careful planning. You have a 5-week-old. That's one of the harder age windows to work with. YTA.", "If your wife was fine with your arrangement, that's where it stops.\n\nThat being said, two older kids could start pulling their weight, especially the 17 year old. Them not having to lift a finger and then refusing to step in when asked for a bit of help a selfish move. I'd make sure to teach them that if you won't scratch my back, I won't scratch yours.", "YTA, your a Father and a husband, helping out your wife and children, is just your duty.", "If this was just about you needing a day to yourself, that is understandable, especially if it was pre-scheduled and you had plans.  If your two older kids are doing nothing to help around the house and you are not talking to them about that choice, not so understandable.", "Info: what does 6 bags of rubbage from the eldest mean?", "ESH.\n\nYour wife for creating way too much unnecessary work.\n\nAnd you, not for your me day but for not doing enough chores in general; and for not assigning chores to your kids.\n\nNot your mama, though, kudos to her for telling you to do more \ud83d\ude0a", "If you and your wife are both perfectly happy with how you two divide the work, then NTA. In a vacuum I'd be inclined to agree with your mother, but moral crusading is only useful if we're actually improving other people's lives, rather than just forcing other people to live like we want to live.\n\nEven if you don't change any of the actual work arrangements, it'd be good for the teenagers to start to learn how to cook etc, just to build life skills, even if wife is going to still put things the way she wants afterwards.", "NTA. and your mother is. Seems to me you and your wife have come to an arrangement that works for you. Marriage isn\u2019t a 50/50 proposition. Sometimes you have to do it all and sometimes you don\u2019t do jack. What matters is that you maintain love for one another through it all. It seems like that\u2019s happening here and your mother is butting her head in where it does not belong.", "NTA\n\nThis was a pre arranged Me day because OP wated to go to his friends Birthday.

It sounds like you do shockingly little compared to your wife, particularly if you both work. You basically just clean the kitchen (which I read as doing the dishes nightly and maybe sweeping if she\u2019s lucky), and cook fewer than half the dinners in a week (no you don\u2019t get credit for the eating out night). And your wife does\u2026everything else in the home? You sound like a sloth by comparison. Listen to your mother.

THANK YOU for sharing the link. It WAS brilliant! I hope others take the time to read it. Wish I had something like that around in my early mothering years. (My daughter is 32 now.

You do chores once a week and let\u2019s get honest, the garden is not a chore. It barely needs to be done. \n\nYou\u2019ve checked out as a husband and as a father. Time to relook at responsibilities and for you to pull your weight.", "Call me skeptical on that regarding your wife.\n\nYou said in another comment that she's  breastfeeding. Unless she pumps in advance so that she can leave the baby with her mom (I'm also skeptical that you're taking care of your younger kids on her \"me\" days), her \"me\" day still involves full care of an infant. So not much of a \"me\" day.\n\nAnd even if she does pump, her \"me\" days are still constrained by needing to plan for being able to pump at least once or twice during the day. Awkward at best.\n\nAnd was the 2 year old breastfeed also? If so, then there's a good chance your wife hasn't had a real \"me\" day since they were born. Possibly before depending on how she was feeling at the end of the first pregnancy.\n\nThe only possibility I see there for her to have had a few real \"me\" days in the last 2.5 to 3 years is if your 2 year old weaned either before or early in her second pregancy. And even that's still somewhat dependant on how her body was handling the pregnancy and whether she had a couple of good months between the early no-energy & morning sickness stage and the late \"I'm just ready for baby to come\" stage.\n\nAnd she's not going to get real \"me\" days again until the infant is weaned... If then.\n\nOh, and for the record, your mom is absolutely right that your older kids should be helping around the house. Your wife shouldn't be having to clean up after them like she is. I wouldn't be surprised if their messes are part of why your wife feels she has to deep clean twice a month.\n\nAnd you shouldn't be telling her not to pick up their rooms. You should telling them that they need to. She's not going to stop doing it unless she sees them actually in an acceptable condition.\n\nAnd honestly, if 6 bags of garbage out of their rooms is normal, you should be riding herd on them to make sure that their rooms are picked up regularly. Not your wife. You. They're your kids.", "lol you are full stop not contributing enough to pull your weight. YTA.", "You mentioned your wife is breastfeeding and doing the night feeds.

You have a 5 week old newborn, your \"you time\" is going to be on pause for a bit. Your wife is still recovering from pregnancy and childbirth and still cleaning up after everyone? That's messed up.
