Unless she pumps in advance so that she can leave the baby with her mom (I'm also skeptical that you're taking care of your younger kids on her \"me\" days), her \"me\" day still involves full care of an infant. So not much of a \"me\" day.\n\nAnd even if she does pump, her \"me\" days are still constrained by needing to plan for being able to pump at least once or twice during the day. Awkward at best.\n\nAnd was the 2 year old breastfeed also? If so, then there's a good chance your wife hasn't had a real \"me\" day since they were born. Possibly before depending on how she was feeling at the end of the first pregnancy.\n\nThe only possibility I see there for her to have had a few real \"me\" days in the last 2.5 to 3 years is if your 2 year old weaned either before or early in her second pregancy. And even that's still somewhat dependant on how her body was handling the pregnancy and whether she had a couple of good months between the early no-energy & morning sickness stage and the late \"I'm just ready for baby to come\" stage.\n\nAnd she's not going to get real \"me\" days again until the infant is weaned... If then.\n\nOh, and for the record, your mom is absolutely right that your older kids should be helping around the house. Your wife shouldn't be having to clean up after them like she is.

You should telling them that they need to. She's not going to stop doing it unless she sees them actually in an acceptable condition.\n\nAnd honestly, if 6 bags of garbage out of their rooms is normal, you should be riding herd on them to make sure that their rooms are picked up regularly.

Babysitting isn't apart of that.", "I don't know your wife's motivation for intervening when you attempt to make them contributing members of the household but it's not doing them any favors. Soon they'll be grown ups with their own place,  maybe roommates,  eventually spouses and children,  and they will be used to being coddled and not knowing how to maintain their own space or contribute to their family. I'd have a (non accusatory) conversation with your wife about this.", "Because both you and your wife have helped create a system in which you and your sons are more work for your wife if you \"try to help\" than if you just weren't there at all. \n\nBe careful, becuse one day she might just decide she doesn't want any of this at all any more.", "Because she wants you to step up", "Why don\u2019t you do it? They\u2019re your kids.", "Do you realize that when you have a 5-week-old you never \"pump for the day?\" I think you're way out of touch.", "Pumping is still work.", "Pumping still isn't time off though. She has to pump every 2-2 1/2 hours to keep the milk flowing or either she produces less milk or even worse she could get a engogerment which hurts as hell I can tell you - I made the mistake of wanting to sleep through a night when my preemie was in the hospital. You can't do what you want or even truly relax when pumping, it's not that much better than having the baby with you. \n\nYou should support your wife more and teach your children to clean after them properly because they obviously van't if your wife takes out thatmuch trash out of their rooms. If she wants things to get done a certain way then she probably does because you and or your children refuse to do it properly unless she is actually neurotic but then she needs therapy for basically javing to deep clean constantly but I hardly believe that if she takes out mulitple bags of rubbish out of your teenaged childrens rooms. \n\nYou just showed your wife she can't count on you whilch is going to bite you in the ass later on your marriage. Those things add up.", "why is OP getting downvoted for that?", "I'm guessing OP just gets super angry and wife is trying to keep the peace. Not a good approach long-term, so I hope they figure out a different system. This family sounds like it has \"let's not upset _____\" walking on eggshells written all over it.", "I used to have to pump at work ever 2.5 hours and figure out how to store my milk using ice packs. I never had a lunch break, I would just pump while drinking a protein drink. It fucking sucks. I would not consider a day of pumping numerous times a day \"a day off.\" It's hard enough doing it at work with an office with a closing door, think about trying to go our with your friends for \"a day off.\" I've pumped in public bathrooms. It's a source of stress especially if you're with people who don't have babies. Some people just don't get it.", "Because during that stage of breastfeeding you have to pump every 2 to 2.5 hours to help support supply and keep baby fed right (they can't drink much at one time at that age and supply needs to be built up over time during that early stage). If they were using formula I'd understand it, but pumping \"for the day?\" Heck no. Engorgement, mastitis, loss of supply, all these things can happen \"in a day.\" Is that really a day off? No. And OP has 4 kids and doesn't know that yet, which tells me OP doesn't know jack about childcare which means OP hasn't been there for wife at all. That's why OP is getting downvoted.\n\nBreastfeeding mothers rarely sleep more than 2 hours at a time in the first 6-8 weeks of a baby's life. It's like torture. I had two unmedicated births and I'd rather do that again than breastfeed again. You NEVER get a break, even when you're sick. You NEVER GET A BREAK.", "Pumping is the fucking worst. It's really baffling that there isn't a better pumping system out there by now. I shudder thinking back to my pumping days."]}
