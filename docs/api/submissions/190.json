If COVID isn't real the kid can't test positive for it.", "OP you are TA for having health issues\u2026 /s\n\nOfc ur NTA they should\u2019ve known much better for bringing a Covid positive kid to a camping trip. If they\u2019re positive for Covid or even if someone they\u2019re close to is, they should stay home and let others enjoy a free of Covid trip.", "NTA. Just because they don't believe it exists, doesn't mean it doesn't. They just don't want to give up any life comforts and pretend it is a lie. I wouldn't invite them to Thanksgiving if I were you.\n\nEdited: I really wanted to add. Just because they are \\*family\\* doesn't mean we should have to be forced to put up with them. Live your life the way you want to. If it doesn't match up with others, it doesn't match up. You can try to make it work, but if only one side is willing to try to meet in the middle, then it isn't worth the effort.", "NTA. And do you really trust these relatives to respect your boundaries at Thanksgiving either? I don't think so.", "NTA. You owe no one an apology, unlike your horrible relative who not only brought their kid on a plane to infect others, but who is also fine potentially infecting you. Not to mention that flying across the country and camping is not the proper way to take care of a sick child. Your relative is behaving terribly at every turn.\n\nPlease do not host Thanksgiving this year if you are vulnerable. Holiday celebrations are often spreader events.", "NTA. I\u2019d tell them figure out something else for Thanksgiving cause I got nothing to apologise for. If you got a problem with me being safe you sure ain\u2019t coming here with your germs\u2026", "NTA. \n\nThe relatives who jeopardized your health, your job, and the lives of your patients while insulting you enough to chase you from a family vacation?  They are no longer invited to your Thanksgiving.  Someone else can host if they want them there, but you will not be coming.\n\nDie on this hill, because it can literally cost you your job and kill your patients.  It\u2019s not just Covid now, the flu is back with a vengeance and you know these people won\u2019t be careful.", "NTA I'd say that as long as they pretend Covid doesn't exist then you pretend they don't exist.\n\nCovid aside, if the kid has symptoms of AN ILLNESS and they still ignored the fact that you are immunocompromised then they don't give a shit about your health.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Reuse to apologize. And refuse to invite that AH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf they want that AH there, somebody else can host.,", "NTA", "NTA.  You went to the camping trip with the best of intentions.  Your family member brings a kid with an active COVID infection.  Shortly thereafter I am sure other people became COVID positive also.\n\nIt is a shame that you spent your time and money for a trip that you had to cut short bc of your family members' opinions about COVID.  \n\nPersonally, I would cancel Thanksgiving and send out notices that due to unforeseen circumstances you cannot host this year.  Of course, be prepared for the possibility that you will not be invited/accepted as the host the following year.  \n\nMy husband caught COVID after a recent plane trip and I caught it from him.  It is difficult when you are not immuno-compromised.  Anyone who says COVID is a myth is ridiculously poorly informed.", "Hard NTA. Setting aside the bullshit that is \u201ccovid is not real\u201d why the fuck would you invite people who talked shit about you into your home? And *you* have to apologise? Nah.
