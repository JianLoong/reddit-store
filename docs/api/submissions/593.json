We got engaged when i was 22 and he 25 but we just never got to the actual marrying part. We just had been busy with moving and starting our family. Until he suddenly passed away in a motorcycle accident when i was pregnant with his son. It was unbearable. My heart was broken into a million pieces. On that day i lost my best friend, partner and the father of my (unborn) son.\n\nI always wore the ring on a necklace since i work in a hospital, 'cause still want to have it with me. Co-workers often thought it was strange that i didn't want to move on, but i was moving on in my own way. I eventually meet my current bf (32) and we actually hit it off quite well. He treats my son like his own and takes very good care of me.\n\nWe eventually had the \"dead fiance\" talk and he comforted me, but told me that eventually it had to pass. So now 2 years later, yesterday, he asks me why i still wear the ring. I explain that it's an important part of me and i can't just  put it down. He got upset with me and tried to take the necklace off. When i told him that i will not take the necklace off he started doubting my love for him.\n\nHe wasn't gaslighting me or anything, he just said that it made him uncomfortable that i still wore my DEAD fiance's ring around my neck. It made him insecure and think that i still was in love with my ex fiance. I tried to explain that its just a memory of him and i'd rather have a ring than pictures or a tattoo (for example). We eventually decided to just let it go and now i can't stop wondering if i'm in the wrong...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: For the people worried that he touched me: i already told him that i was very uncomfortable by the way he tried to take the necklace off. He understood and told me he would never do it again.\n\nIf youre saying or thinking (about commenting) that im still in love with my ex fiance: dont bother. Yes i do love him still, but i am not IN love with him. He will always be a part of me and thats it. I've worked on my grieving for the past 5 years, and i'm so much better. My son will know who his dad is and i will give him the ring when he is old enough.\n\nAfter a lot of people saying that i should take the ring off, i will just not now. If my bf proposes to me in the future i will take it off because it is indeed weird to wear 2 rings.

Have your wits about you.", "NTA\n\nI was in the NAH club until the part about him trying to take it off of you. That is just way out of line! \n\nHonestly, it's a memory of someone you loved and will always love. He was your son's father and his memory will always be special. Why does the new guy feel threatened by this, especially two years into your relationship? If you were wearing it on your ring finger (except when at work), that would be odd. But you're not doing that.  It just doesn't make much sense to me. \n\nBut he crossed a big line by trying to take it off of you. That would raise all my caution flags and I'd be starting to wonder just how controlling he's going to get as time goes on.", "NTA. Love and grief are complicated. It\u2019s weird to me that it bothers your current boyfriend so much that you wear the ring on a necklace. Like that\u2019s a red flag to me especially since he got physical with you by trying to take it off of you. That\u2019s really disturbing behavior. If I were you I\u2019d set some firm boundaries and maybe rethink this relationship. \n\nAt the same time if you are still having issues processing your grief (I don\u2019t think  wearing the necklace is a sign of that but I don\u2019t know your full situation) maybe look into speaking with a therapist or grief counselor.", "NTA. He was not just your fiance but the father of your child. The ring from him represents a memory, whereas your bf is the present and if you every marry, your bf's ring will be a promise.\n\nThe great thing about love is that it is infinite.  Your love for your bf is in no way diminished by the love for your deceased fiance or the love for your child or your family. Maybe if you explain it like that your bf will understand that he is not in competion. He is the present but that doesn't mean you forget the past.", "NTA. It's a part of you and your son's life. Personally, I say keep wearing it. You're keeping his memory alive for you. Nothing wrong with still loving him.\n\nYour boyfriend seems like he's insecure in your relationship. You two need to communicate more.", "NTA\nIn a perfect world, you would still be with your fiancee and married.  Unless you are comparing the two of them to one another, that loss, and your deceased fiancee are part of you and your life story.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s an important momento of someone you cared deeply for. Everyone grieves in their own way and sometimes it\u2019s just nice to have something that reminds you of someone. \n\nYou don\u2019t go into detail of your current relationship but it sounds like you have moved on and care about this new person. You went though a traumatic event and this ring helps give you peace. \n\nSounds like he might be upset that you still love the fianc\u00e9 that passed away and is threatened by that. You need to have a talk with him about how having this momento does not mean you are not ready to move on or that you don\u2019t love him.", "NTA\n\nYou ARE still in love with your dead fiance, and that's okay! The heart is big enough to hold a place for your late fiance and still have room for your boyfriend. Your boyfriend needs to understand that it isn't a competition, and that grief has to process in its own way.", "NTA because his reaction went from \u201chey this makes me uncomfortable\u201d to physically trying to remove it and making it about him. \n\nHow long have you been with him? I could see this being an issue if you were engaged or getting married. What if you had been widowed?", "NTA\n\nYou can have love for you ex fianc\u00e9, while still loving your boyfriend. But you may want to also consider his feelings as the relationship progresses. \n\nAnd allow me to get a little crass.   Do you take it off when you are bumping uglies?  Imagine him going to town while the ring is bouncin\u2019 around.", "I don't think it's wrong of you to continue to wear the ring, but you might want to consider that he may not ever feel comfortable proposing to you while it's still around your neck. So your plan to leave it on until you get engaged may keep you two at an impasse. Consider that from others' perspective it symbolizes that you're still engaged to your first finance. You have every right to wear it for the rest of your life if you want to. You're not an AH for that. But just understand that there's potentially a cost to it.\n\nI didn't think your bf was an AH either until he tried to remove the necklace. Sorry, but even with a promise to never do it again that's an impulse that's troubling. People eventually show you who they are. It feels like this was one of those reveals that shouldn't be glossed over.", "NTA\n\nI was going with N-A-H until you said he tried to *take the necklace off you*. Not cool! It moves him from \u201creasonably sharing his feelings/discomfort\u201d to \u201ctrying to force you to align with his preferences.\u201d That\u2019s not a good look. Is it a one-off?\n\nIf it *is* a one-off, you guys should talk this through over time - weeks or months. Is his discomfort worth you revisiting how closely you need to hold this talisman? Your former fianc\u00e9 will always be important to you and your son, but given your current relationship, do you still need the *continuous* reminder? The answer may be yes! I\u2019m not trying to tell you how to feel! But you now know that \u201cyes\u201d is not something your bf can live with indefinitely. It may be a relationship-ender.\n\nIf you carry on this relationship, I suspect you\u2019ll eventually be ready to put the ring in a jewelry box for your daughter-in-law or granddaughter. But it\u2019ll be *when you\u2019re ready*, not today. And *because you\u2019re ready*, not because BF decides that it\u2019s time.", "NTA. You\u2019ll always love that guy. He died, you didn\u2019t break up. Maybe someday the jewellery will go from your neck to a box to keep for your son. But that\u2019s not up to your current man. He\u2019s going to have to be patient with you\u2026 because grief and love don\u2019t just end for the comfort of others.", "If he was a true \"ex\" it would be strange, but he is your \"late\" fiance, not ex - therefore continue processing your grief as you wish. Your current bf obviously has not gone through the same experiences and cannot relate and is coming from a place of jealousy. His issues, not yours. Don't let him put those issues on you. If he decides to propose in the future, you can choose to put your old ring away for safekeeping for your son in the future and wear your new ring. Until then, the only ring you have from a \"late\" fiance (on a necklace mind you) is fair game for your grieving.", "NAH. He might worry he's still competing with a dead guy and he'll never win or measure up. You obviously wear it because it means a lot to you. \n\nWould you be open to having the gem reset as a necklace without the ring? You are NOT obligated to or anything but is it something you'd consider? You'd still be honoring his memories and his impact on your life but in a not as blatantly obvious way?", "How is anyone saying this guy isn\u2019t an asshole for trying to take her necklace off?", "NAH. I can see both sides. Your bf is your present and it sounds like he could be your future. He treats you and your son very well and you love him. As someone who lost a fiance too soon, I understand the shock and grief - the what-should-have-been. That you're still wearing the ring daily seems to  say you haven't yet said goodbye. It might be time to set aside this symbol of your past. It doesn't mean you'll forget your fiance. Buy a special keepsake box and keep your fiance's ring there - you can look at it whenever you wish and give it to your son when he's ready. It will be a sign to yourself and your bf that you're ready to move forward. Having said that, if you're not ready, you're not ready. Good luck, OP.", "As someone with a dead fianc\u00e9 in the past too, NTA\n\nYour boyfriend is jealous of a dead guy. It won\u2019t be long before he tries the \u201cif he was still alive, you wouldn\u2019t be with me\u201d line. And it will only escalate from there. \n\nIf you were wearing it on your ring finger, my judgement might be different. But on a necklace? Naw.", "NTA. He is still your son's father.", "NTA\nYou are still grieving.\nThat's OK.\nIf you self feel overwhelmed, perhaps you look in grieving counseling. Perhaps with the bf, that he can recognize your emotions better?", "NTA.\n\nI don't understand why you should ever have to take the ring off. It's a memento of someone you loved. People do this for parents, friends, etc. Coming into that relationship, I would never expect to replace your husband. I mean, he's literally not there anymore and if he was, I wouldn't be there. \n\nIt's pretty concerning your boyfriend is threatened by a ring from a person who is no longer here.", "NAH\n\nTo you it has special meaning\n\nTo your BF it will be a constant reminder that he\u2019s only there because your ex unfortunately isn\u2019t.", "Imo: Boyfriend no, but it'll be weird if you're wearing two fiance rings.\n\nDude can compete with a man, but can't compete with the memories of a man. I understand his insecurities.\n\nNo judgement.", "NTA\n\nYour partner passed, and its part of your life. I mean, what next, ask you to ship your child to your parents?\n\nI mean, if you wanna diffuse it, maybe consider giving it to your son later on?", "NAH\n\nI understand why your fianc\u00e9 is uncomfortable with your continuing to wear the ring since a ring is such a symbol of romantic love and marriage. I think pictures are less problematic because they are a part of your history and a part of your son's life since he was the boy's father and should have a prominent place in your son's life as part of his heritage.\n\nI would probably not wear the ring anymore and keep it as an heirloom for your son - maybe for his fiancee or daughter or grandchild.", "NAH. You are understandably still connected and grieving. He wants to be the love of your life and the ring is a reminder that he isn't.", "I feel from your story and your replies that you might not be ready for a new relationship. Your bf might sense this as well. I would suggest couples therapy to see what is needed to make this work for both of you. And maybe some therapy for just you. NAH. Although he shouldnt have tried to take it off.", "Nta, and here's a perfect explanation for this... Person. If your fiance were still alive, then your current ah bf wouldn't be there. I would leave him, especially since he tried taking your engagement ring.", "NTA    tell your boyfriend to stop being jealous of a dead man.\n\nI think its bullshit to believe that wearing this ring on a chain means anything other than you keeping a precious memory. I don't understand jealousy to be honest, the fact that you are with the new person should tell them enough. Are we supposed to give up our past, when it is that past that put us where we are now?\n\nYes, if your previous boyfriend was still alive you would be with him, but he isn't, and you never will be. The you that had that love, and loss, has grown into the woman your current boyfriend loves, and you wouldn't be that person without your past.\n\nIt's not like you wear it on your ring finger, it's a necklace, and he needs to get over it.\n\nI know this isn't a common belief, but it should be.", "It depends on if the boyfriend is aware and okay with the fact that you still love your ex? If he isn't then you do have a responsibility to tell him and have an open conversation about it, it's not okay to keep something like that from the person you are with due to the effect it could have on their mental health", "As a man who was in a relationship with a woman who had similar circumstances, My ex did the same thing with mementos of him, always saying she wasn't ready to let them go until \"xyz\" happened, and when it did, she'd just move the goalpost. It was like borrowing someone else's wife. If Op's boyfriend sees this, she said if you propose in the FUTURE, meaning she wants much more time to cling to that ring, if you propose and the ring doesn't come off the same day, get out immediately...\n\nI wasted 10 years and untold thousands of dollars on what I thought would be a family in the same situation, and she ended up leaving me for someone who would accept her mementos and hang up's, I'm now 45 years old, don't waste your love like I did, she's already taken...", "NTA - But you've been wearing this ring for years now and I think for anyone, it would be hard to stare at it every day yet hearing you say you're in love with them. Trying to take it off of you was not cool - I can only assume he was incredibly desperate or frustrated with your refusal to consider removing it. I can only suggest you find a way to productively deal with your grief so that you can freely move on with another partner. Best of luck OP", "NAH however this is an insecurity he needs to fix on his own. your grief is not your co-workers or your boyfriend\u2019s business. its YOURS. you choose how you grieve and deal with this. this was a man you share a son with, a man you loved very much. hes allowed to feel uncomfortable but if he cant swallow his insecurities and support you on this then i think its time to question where this relationship is going", "NTA. While I understand it's a part of you it's been quite a long time. When I read this I immediately had the feeling that you're not truly ready to move on. Because it's pretty clear you're not otherwise you would at the very least be trying to take it off. A ring doesn't symbolize your love for your late ex more than your son does. You're going to have to decide are you ready to \"move on\" or are you ready to let go of this great guy? Because I'm sorry after 2 YEARS not many are going to be okay with this and are going to have the same mindset. Is it worth losing someone so amazing because of this?v", "NAH\n\nBut if I was your bf I would dump you as he will never be able to compete with your dead ex.", "I understand why he\u2019s upset I would be too personally I wouldn\u2019t wanna be involved with someone still so stuck on the past but I still get where you\u2019re coming from it\u2019s a part of your past but still I personally wouldn\u2019t get involved with someone Who is still wearing to engagement one of their deceased ex", "Yta. How would you feel if the roles were reversed? I doubt you would like it much either.", "YTA in as much ss you're not in love with your deceased fiance but neither are you with your current partner. There's other ways of honouring your son's father than rubbing it in the face of your current guy. Do you realise that the most positive thing you said about him is that you've \"hit it off\" and \"he helps you\"?", "Sort of NAH for the original situation. \n\nYou have good, happy memories of a man you spent 9 years with whom you lost suddenly and will always be a part of your life because you created a son together before his passing. \nYour bf feels like he's competing with a ghost which whilst I understand it, he needs to shake that feeling because it won't change. He's being reminded that the loss of your fiance is the only reason he's in your life now (it probably feels like he's the default or second place). \n\nI say sort of NAH because the \"tried to take the necklace of me\" crosses a line imo. That's not right behaviour so please watch that.", "I understand his position. The ring is specifically a symbol of pair bonding, not a simple memorial.\n\nNAH, but if you aren't ready to stop wearing it, you haven't fully left that relationship.", "It was NAH until, \"He got upset with me and tried to take the necklace off.\"  Tell him there is no difference between the ring necklace and any other sentimental piece of jewelry.  Ask him if it was a ring from your deceased grandmother, would have the same problem?  He wants you to prove your love by removing the necklace.  Why can't he prove his love by acknowledging your past with respect and letting this matter go?  A person that is confident in themself does not need to demand something like this.  Maybe you should reexamine your relationship to see if there are other signs that this may become an issue.  Does he want to get rid of pictures of your child's father?  What about possessions of your child's father that you may be holding for your child at a later date?  Does he expect to replace your child's father and have no mention of the father if you get married?   Will he expect to adopt your child and have the last name changed?  Will he expect your child to call him dad even if the child does not want to?", "I am a man and am confused your son is a living breathing reminder of your former fianc\u00e9 so why is the ring so important especially as it is an engagement ring?", "NAH, but a slight lean towards him sucking for this.\n\n\nI think you should feel free to wear that ring until the day you die if you choose to, and I understand why. \n\n\nHowever, it would be inappropriate to wear it on your ring finger and I can see ot around the neck being too prominent. I could see ot being weird when he is making love to you with it being right there.\n\n\nStrangely enough, I would have no problem with it on your right hand. At the end of the day it doesn't matter though: We all have previous relationships and this one was more than just some guy. \n\n\nThe boyfriend also has no right to feel defensive or insecure about someone who is no longer alive, but it is obvious he does feel those things and I kind of get it. I hope you two can figure it out.", "NAH. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve moved on as much as you think. It\u2019s time to put the ring elsewhere. Look at it from time to time and keep it for your son for his future wife. Your bf is insecure yes but I understand his feeling like you haven\u2019t moved on. Don\u2019t let the future go by clinging to your  past. Good luck.", "I even don't read the text. You are with someone and still wearing someone else's ring. You are saying him that you will never love him. You should NOT be in a love relationship. You both are stupid and disrespectful to each other.", "Get some therapy please.", "YTA but you're not really an asshole. Maybe just put the ring in a special place and stop wearing it? You have to let go. It's a little weird and unhealthy at this point.\n\nIf he wore his hot, dead ex-wife's wedding band around his neck, you would probably feel insecure too.\n\nIt bothers him to the point he tried to take it off of you.

This is your way to cope with the loss while also moving on without losing the memory of the time you had with him. The decision to take the ring off should not be made under the pressure of your current SO, it should be left entirely up to you and you alone. Losing someone is very difficult, i still wear accessories etc of people i lost over 10 years ago.

I have been married to my current love of my life, after my fianc\u00e9 passed many years earlier.  I still wear the engagement ring on a different finger.  He is part of my past, and that\u2019s part of my current life.  We have a beautiful baby girl, and my husband at one point expressed his jealousy for my dead ex.  I asked what I could do to elevate the jealousy, and I now wear my old ring on one hand, and my engagement and wedding ring on my marriage ring finger.

Make sure you stress that your past made you fall in love with current life, and you wouldn\u2019t be who you are today without those previous building blocks.  Maybe talk about a promise ring, so no engagement just a piece of jewelry that can be worn and treasured.  Nothing outlandish, just a little something l.  And wear both proudly!!!", "NTA but you do need to realize this maybe a deal breaker.", "NTA \n\nHim trying to forcefully take it off is too much.", "You could have it be an heirloom for your son.

Well maybe not. \n\nYou arent moving on from an ex, and you sound like you have gotten on with life and that necklace doesn\u2019t make it any less so.\n\nMaybe its lucky, maybe its not but its yours and so is your grief. \n\nWe grieve not only the people gone but the lives we had with them and the future we could have had.\n\nNTA", "Sorry for your loss... it takes time... but have you ever spoken to a professional to help you have good coping skills?

It's a very sad position to be in & extremely heartbreaking & I am so sorry this happened to you, especially with his child on the way. I understand the comfort level you get by wearing his ring, but if you're going to be able to move on in a successful relationship or marriage, it's time to put his ring away, some place safe, like in a jewelry box, a safe or a safety deposit box to save for your son to give to his fiance. Or you could have it made into something else. Either way, you're not disrespecting his memory by not wearing it. If anything, you are holding onto something that can't be held on to. The ring is not him. Your current bf sounds like a very lovely person & would like to have all of you in the relationship, not part of you or you & your former fiance's memory. \nI don't think either of you are TA, but I think you've had a great blessing by having 2 wonderful men come into your life & love you.

I'm not english myself so grammar is sometimes still pretty hard. If my current bf decides to propose i would take the ring off, ofcourse, i will not wear two rings.

If he would propose to me now, i'd think he'd only ask me so i would take the ring off.", "I totally agree he\u2019s an asshole for trying to take off the necklace. Very unsettling, IMO. OP, if you are going to remain in this relationship, I STRONGLY urge you both to get pre-marital couples counseling.", "The \"if he was alive\" line made me laugh to be honest.

Someone called me TA but not really an ah because it was unhealthy and weird for me to still wear the ring. I was \"disrespecting\" my current relationship.

As i mentioned i work in a hospital, there can't be stuff swinging around. It's always under my shirt. Its just the mere idea that somehow pisses him off. About my grief: it has been a hard 5 years, but every year it became a bit easier somehow. I believe in reincarnation, so whenever i saw a butterfly that came close, or cats (oh he LOVED cats!) i'd think of him and know that he was in a better place. My current bf also really helped with the process after we had the talk. Its just the ring he's really bugged about.", "I shouldn't have to choose between the two. That is ridiculous.

That will be why the ring is bothering him so much.
