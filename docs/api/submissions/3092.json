Eventually he got up and said he had to go and answer a work call. I could hear him puking in the bathroom, and MIL went to check on him. He said dinner was disgusting, but he was raised that it is rude not to eat what someone gives you, and he knew about the previous issues and thought if he didn't eat it, we would think it was on purpose and it would hurt MILs relationship with her son.\n\nMIL acted like that was the sweetest thing ever and then yelled at me for \"poisoning\" Jack. I asked if he wanted something else, we had some easy options, but he said he had to go. Apparently MIL made him grilled cheese when they got home, but he coudln't eat that due to the \"memory of my cooking\"\n\nnow you must think I am an awful cook, lol, actually I'm not I promise.

I was confused because I didn't even know it was his birthday, but she began ranting about how they went out for his birthday but he couldn't eat his favorite burger as it has bacon, and apparently he still won't eat bacon. also his mom usually gets him some maple bacon coffee cake but he won't eat that either. I was just staring at her and MIL yelled at me about how they had to sit their and eat it in front of Jack and it was so sad. She was just very animated (maybe a touch stoned, she doesn't normally act like that) and I thought it was funny. I burst out laughing.\n\nMIL said I'm disrespectful for laughing in her face.

Apparently he was \"sensitive\" to bacon fat but didn't tell anyone ahead of time and bacon burgers and bacon flavored cake are his favorite things, though, which, I'm mostly very curious.\n\nMy husband got very sick (not food related) and stopped being able to eat one of our favorite go-to dishes because he had it just before as well, but to pick out the bacon fat specifically is a bit odd.
