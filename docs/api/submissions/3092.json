Same old MIL Troll. Same tired old MIL Troll tropes.", "Took nearly a decade before I could smell butterscotch let alone eat it after getting sick once (got drunk on butterscotch schnapps).", "I had a similar experience with vodka. In 1993 when I was a broke 18 year old, my buddies and I got our hands on a fifth of Smirnoff. We only had a 2 liter bottle of Sam's Pineapple soda to use as a chaser. Ten shots and three violent vomiting episodes later, it took me years to get used to the smell of vodka without feeling ill.", "This is also me but with black bean sauce and chicken flavour crisps. Neither of those made me ill but puking them up put me right off eating them ever again.", "Hot cheez-its. Burned SO bad coming up.", "I can't drink purple grape juice because of throwing up it up, too. White grape juice is fine. \ud83d\ude05 I don't think it wasn't nearly as disgusting as those 2 things would be, though. Ick.", "I eventually recovered from my gin incident as well, but it took at least a year. That was a good hack to use the olive to overwhelm the juniper :)", "I was thinking that, too, did MIL poison his plate when no one was looking? because this is so odd, MIL and OP have a food issue, and it just so happens that her new boyfriend gets sick from OP's food? sounds too convenient to me, if we assume that OP's not lying about being a good cook. lol"]}
