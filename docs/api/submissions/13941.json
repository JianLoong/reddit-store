Block that toxic mess.", "NTA. It was great of you to offer to help her when y\u2019all were together, but you\u2019re not anymore. Any agreement ended when the relationship ended. Stop paying for her debt. It\u2019s never going away.", "NTA.  \n\n\nYou were helping her under the understanding that you were a team/soon to be married couple.  You are under no such obligation now that she's not your fiancee.", "NTA, you're an ex, not a source of income.", "It would make sense after you break up that you\u2019re no longer sharing or helping with her finances.

She made her bed she can sleep in it", "NATA.  Stop letting her use you.", "NTA.  Of course she is seething.  She has learned from the past that when she gets angry she gets what she wants.   Let her be angry.  That is her choice.  Why are you even talking to her?  Do you have some idea that to be a good person you need to keep your word in all cases?  You don't.  When someone abuses your trust like that, they lose all right to expect anything from you.   You never would have made that agreement in the first place if you knew she was cheating on you, so you aren't beholden to it now.\n\nCut her off.  All she offers you is misery, and apparently financial control.  It doesn't matter that you care for her, it doesn't matter that you might love her, none of it matters.\n\nDon't believe anyone that says you should be the bigger person, or that you should still support her because she must be hurting or she is counting on you, or any other thing they say.  Do not try to be her white knight. The best thing you can do for her is to block her on everything and let her experience the consequences of her actions.  Only when she has no other options might she turn inward and accept that she is the one causing her misery.  And she is the one that needs to get herself out.  \n\nNow go out there and spend that money on yourself.  Or use it for the good of humanity.  You decide.", "INFO\n\nWhere did the debt come from? Was she covering your bill or shared bills with it?", "NTA come on man. Your cheating partner is mad that you are no longer paying off her own debts that she lied about.

You no longer have any reason to literally invest in her and her mistakes. Nope.", "NTA.  Any obligation to help ended the second your relationship did.  Or at least when she broke your trust.  \n\nUnless you said 'even if you cheat on me and we break up I'll keep paying', you're not the asshole.

Four maxed out credit cards, including secret cards, with you making minimum payments on them all and her paying \u2026 probably nothing\u203d  Aside from the cheating, you will be paying this woman\u2019s cc debt forever if you don\u2019t stop right now.  \n\nI know someone like this.  While you\u2019re paying off those 4 cards (which will take forever with minimum payments), she\u2019ll have already opened several more cards and they will be maxed out too.

Were you expected to just keep helping to pay her bills forever?  The end of the engagement should have been the end of the financial assistance.  Make a clean break from her and go find a woman who deserves your good-hearted generosity.", "She expects you to help pay off her credit cards. Thats the only information we need to know. \n\nShe got herself in debt, you don't need to help one bit. She can pull herself out of this one. \n\nNTA at all.
