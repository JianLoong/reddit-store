Good board gamers should help set up and put away games. Great gamers appreciate a host by helping out in any way they need, lest they not get invited back.\n\nAnd honestly if you place is cluttered and not dirty it shouldn't take too long for him to declutter it sufficiently to play a board game.

And while \"he sat me down and told me\" sounds a bit asshole-y, it sounds like the end point of the conversation was him asking you what you were up for and whether the things he was hoping you would do would work for you. If it felt like he's just assuming you will do everything he wants on your own, and he won't need to contribute at all, that would be pretty shitty, but I'm extending him the benefit of the doubt on that. \n\nAlso, you say this is about him cleaning for his guests, but if I read correctly, you'd also play the game and enjoy the company, no? You say \"We'd like to start having people over\", right? The details there matter - if this is just his game, his friends, and his mess, it's one thing, but if you'd play and enjoy yourself, and might even invite some of your friends, it's another. \n\nOverall, it sounds like your general household agreements have him being the primary income earner and you being the primary parent and household manager. Obviously, there's lots of details to negotiate in terms of how you both contribute to parenting and taking care of your home, but it doesn't seem totally out of line for him to want to check in about what your capacity to support these game nights will be. \n\nThe classic couples therapy line is that you have to talk to each other and work together to make a plan. If he really wants a full 1950's come home to sit in your recliner, smoke your pipe, and read the newspaper while you make him a drink and put a meal on the table, well, it seems unlikely that would work out well. But it does seem like you could plan ahead and think about the roles and responsibilities each of you could take on to be ready to host something fun, and it doesn't need to look like only one of you putting in multiple hours on the day of the event. \n\nLet's say you do game night on Thursdays. Could he carve out some weekend time to decide on any snack type stuff you want to serve and do the shopping? Or put it on the shopping list if you already have a regular shopping day? Could he handle any inviting emails or texts and keep track of who is coming? Could he manage 30 minutes of extra cleanup on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings to make sure the house is in decent shape? That all seems like reasonable stuff to expect, and you could talk through what things you could be responsible for, like trying to keep your kids from wrecking the house on the day you're having people over, or making something extra as part of dinner the night before or day of to share with guests. \n\nThat said, this is all based on the assumption that you would actually not hate having people over, and would play the game and take part in the gathering, and that this would be a fun social time for you both. If it's something you both want, even if he is maybe a bit more in to it than you are, there are probably ways to make it work and to share the load. If this really is not something you are in to, and it's just going to add to your existing load without giving anything back, and he's really just hoping you'll make it all happen for him without his engagement, then obviously, say no, and you won't be the asshole for doing so.", "NTA.

My 16 year old needed mom time to talk and get help with homework.  I\u2019ve only got a few more years before he leaves for college, he\u2019s gone more with his friends, he has a part time job, he has sports, he\u2019s hardly ever home.  The fact he wanted to get Thai takeout after his homework and hang out with his mom was worth leaving the dishes in the sink.  I haven\u2019t had that time since Christmas break with him.  These times are getting fewer and far between.  \n\nOP is NTA she just has an overgrown child that happens to bring in an income.  I had one of those myself, he\u2019s now called an ex husband", "I wasn't defending him, to be clear! I meant that if he doesn't clean it'd take him longer to find things, to figure out where things go, probably asking her how the washing machine works etc. (aka weaponised incompetence)\n\nSo HE estimates the time as a few hours because he never does those things, and while it might be quicker if she did it, she still shouldn't have to.", "YTA, talk with him that he could do some more but really. If you are a housewife at 43. You need to really do everything if the man provides with every single dime.", "Except it not even one not working because she\u2019s a stay at home mom and grad student. That\u2019s plenty on her plate to keep track of especially if there\u2019s no childcare besides her.", "Could be anywhere from like 24 to newborn. What\u2019s your point?", "I know what you could say. Why not admit first how wrong you were with your assumption before lecturing people?\n\nAnd please don't try to push it on her that you were wrong", "Looking after the house and cleaning the house are 2 different things to me, one is like maintaining all of life\u2019s affairs and the other is \u2026 cleaning. \n\na lot of maintenance is stuff that guests don\u2019t see\n\nmy guests don\u2019t look in my drawers or dryer, but I\u2019ve done laundry and put it away. Gone grocery shopping. Gone to the bank. Mowed the lawn and weeded and met with the arborist about our sick tree. Picked up our medicine from the pharmacy. Made appointments with dentists and doctors. Replaced all of our hand towels cuz they were a decade old and needed replacing. Took the dog to the vet. Got the car an oil change and swapped winter for summer tires. Sat down and went through all the mail, paid bills, went to post office for stamps. Worked on patching up our broken fence. Driving the kids everywhere, setting up play dates, going to PTA meetings, helping with homework, making last minute trips to the store for big class project supplies. Maybe the house needs to be repainted or our siding needs repaired. Lots and lots and lots of stuff goes in to maintaining a household. \n\nObviously this doesn\u2019t all happen once each week but it\u2019s stuff that needs doing and isn\u2019t necessarily covered by \u201ccleaning\u201d.", "They both have full time jobs. Being a stay at home parent, she doesn't get any time to herself, where his career is fulfilling to his personal identity, she is being a caregiver, home manager, cleaner, cook, etc, and then she is also doing all that work even when he gets home and he gets to rest. He is takes care of a small amount of that, so *she* is supporting *his* career. On top of that she is taking classes to further improve how she can contribute. I don't know when she sleeps."]}
