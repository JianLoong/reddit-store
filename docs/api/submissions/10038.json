I would rather enjoy my friends' company rather than fuss about whether there are kids' toys on the floor or whatever. life is too short for me to judge a friend's home based on that.", "I feel like he could do a bit more, my wife is back to work now that both kids are in school weekly and will be taking the summers off ( it's cheaper to have her unemployed in the summer than pay for daycare for 2 kids ) so we split as much as we can 50/50  \n\n\nIt doesn't sound like he's overly lazy, but slacking a bit ( he should be relieving you more especially on the weekends ) I don't know me personally I don't see spending 2 to 4 hours cleaning the house once a month to be that big an ask?", "All I'm gonna say is that the division of household labor sounds inequitable in your home. Adding on the responsibilities of doing a deep clean for game night would only exacerbate this inequality and its longterm detrimental effects to your marriage. I realize the game night benefits you as well (socialization) but you are correct to say it's not within your capabilities given your other responsibilities (grad school, primary parent, and primary management AND execution of household labor activities)\n\nhttps://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_an_unfair_division_of_labor_hurts_your_relationship", "I tell my wife all the time, that working 50 to 60 hours a week gives me the easy job, stay-at-home moms bust their butts and so I try and do as much as I can on the weekends, even something as simple as taking both kids to the store on a Saturday and giving her 2 hours of \" nobody ask me for a damn thing \" time is a big help to her sanity.", "I get it, but you also said he has a high stress/high paying job. Sounds like both of you do a lot of work(only assuming because idk anything else about your husband\u2019s job), so why not just clean together before y\u2019all\u2019s game? It would get done faster that way too", "Ok, bud.", "They could both put the extra effort in since they are both playing and they would like the house to look a specific way.  Her labor as a stay-at-home mom and student still counts. It could easily be said she deals with the stress of juggling both to avoid the cost of child care and to further a future career so HE can also have a nice life.", "I\u2019m gonna say NAH. Your arrangements are mutually beneficial, since your entry into the workforce will allow him to take more risks on his start up. \n\nOne could argue that your part-time job and increased academic workload are close to him working a full-time job. But since you\u2019re both playing the game, then you should both prepare for it.", "That should change. Immediately. Check out r/JustNoSO. You may relate and they\u2019ll give you strategies for dealing with this. You deserve a partner, not a freeloader who expects you to clean, cook, raise the kids, and get his dick wet.", "If this had been your husband during one of those times, then I would say the same things to him.", "And you let him \u201dsit you down\u201d and talk to you like you are a child? Your post and following comments are so filled with red flags that i dont know what to say really.", "He used to, a lot. Things have been much better the past year or so, so I guess I\u2019m still nervous although he\u2019s much more reasonable.", "I just want to point out: if your friends can\u2019t handle that your house is more cluttered from having kids, they\u2019re not good friends.", "In that case he should definitely put money towards a cleaner. Even if you didn't have your grad studies, professional cleaning is just on a different scope. Theyd only have to come once or twice per month and surely this would be beneficial for you both since it takes stress off of your shoulders and he gets the picobello presentation home he wants?", ">That is kind of the standard he expects,\n\nEwwwww\n\nIf he expect a cleaner-clean house, he should pay for a cleaner.\n\nWhat do you expect? Are his expectations somehow special and need to be met?", "I think if you worked out a system where you kept those things cleaned on a regular basis then it wouldn't be a massive effort every-time game night rolled around, you just sound like you need a little bit of organising and then making sure you keep up with that organising every week.\n\nPutting way shopping bags and wiping the benches is like an 8 minute job. If you keep the bathroom clean every week, it doesn't take long to do a quick wipe of the benches and sweep the floor, and dusting every two days for 5 minutes will help so it doesn't become a big  job.\n\nIt seems like the clutter is the major problem, so I would tackle that first, you might be able to get it organized so you can't keep it un-cluttered all the time.\n\nIf you can get the cleaning down to 45 minutes before company arrives then I think that's something to aim for, it's definitely do-able you just gotta put in some planning and follow through on cleaning tasks every week!", "My husband and I had this discussion about having people over and keeping the house clean. Our new policy is, \u201cdon\u2019t put things down, put them away.\u201d Because a majority of the time it takes barely any more effort to just put it where it belongs (in the trash, pantry, drawer, closet, etc).", "That is a *very* good idea\u2026", "He would definitely like to see me do more than I do, but I think part of the problem is that a lot of what I do is invisible labor to him.", "I highly recommend my personal cleaning method, \"Please come in and pretend the house is clean!\" \n\nWorks like a charm, at least with my friends, and look, if it's a role playing game this method is perfect.", "Yup. Between dming and playing in online rpgs, and playing video games (solo on the couch or with his friends) he averages 20 hours a week. I\u2019m trying to get him to cut down on his dm commitments because he\u2019s so exhausted. I play in one game if his each week, and I\u2019ve had to cancel a bunch lately because I needed to study.", "Yup. Exactly. He\u2019s stressed from work and needs to unwind.", "I think he would. He cleaned more before we had the kid \u2014 even while I was unemployed after moving with him for a new job (twice). He\u2019s be happier just cleaning up after himself, but he doesn\u2019t do that now!", "We did start doing that in December, once a month. I told him we had to because I would not be able to keep the house to a standard that would make either of us happy this semester.", "As a sahm, I can vouch, you don't get out much sometimes and it's really nice to be included and \"to people.\" So I'm sure \"*we* would like\" bc it's something she can enjoy too.  But she does say,  these are his friends and his game. He's the one driving the need for the event,  so he needs to help. Being the breadwinner doesn't absolve him of helping out,  and newsflash,  everyone gets stressed out by their jobs.  So that's a really lame excuse for him not helping.", "Yes, I am hung up on this as well.", "Why doesn\u2019t your wife go to work 50 hours a week and you can stay home with the kids?", "Why even reply lol.", "Not at all. For starters, our labor as a student doesn\u2019t count for anything.  That\u2019s something she\u2019s doing to increase her own value, but not his. And he is actually subsidizing it, if not also financing it. \n\nCleaning the house and raising the kids is her tradeoff for having a nice home and high standard of living.", "Why are you still nervous about it? 'More reasonable'? What does that mean?", "You should not be nervous around your SO. At all.", "I'm sorry OP. That's not cool. Childcare and raising kids is a full time job in and of itself. Cleaning and maintaining a household is it's own second job. I don't think some people understand that. It sounds like your husband might not. And you're doing schooling on top of all of that. It's A LOT and you shouldn't be made to feel bad that your house isn't spotless without help. That's completely unfair and completely unrealistic. It's 2023. Your husband has to realize that marriage is a partnership, and partners help, not delegate. \n\nThat being said, you could read up on different ways to organize and try to find something better that works for you. My biggest battle is keeping the kitchen island clear. Somehow everything ends up on there.  Paper bags, mail, toys, etc. You need a system to help you out if it's feeling insurmountable. You could try things by room.  Or there's the basket method.  Etc.  Your cleaning lady might even be able to give you tips if you ask her.", "I think most of them could (apparently BIL gets nauseous over at our house even when we put in the 3-4 hours but I\u2019ve asked around and no o e else agrees), but he just\u2026 wants to put up a good appearance.", "It definitely sounds like that's the case, and that's something that's going to need to change or else he's going to *keep* making unreasonable demands of you and insist that they're reasonable. It's too bad there's no way to just switch roles for a week, but there's got to be a way to make that invisible labor more visible. \n\n(Also, how much of it is that the labor is really invisible, vs that he really just doesn't want to see or acknowledge it?)", "That's my style as well. We bought one of those \"pardon the mess, we freed the House Elf\" signs and it does the trick", "i feel like you should put all of your comments in the post this is all pretty important info and its starting to paint a messy / unfair situation", "How many hours a week of leisure time do you get?", "I get the feeling he's very into traditional roles. Unfortunately this isn't the 1950s. He needs to help out a little more. He offered the 30-45 minutes.  I'd ask him to make good on that. Or maybe give up one of his online social events to help out.", "Childcare is work, and you also need to unwind. It's weird that he goes out but you never do, and that you couldn't just get a babysitter if you both wanted to go out.", "He needs to find quicker, more efficient ways to \u201cunwind\u201d then. Pushing chores onto you so that he can enjoy every evening isn\u2019t fsir", "This should be a wake up call for him. And you, OP.", "What do you get to do for stress relief? How does it compare in terms of how much time it takes up?", "Well, cleaning can be really good to unwind and destress after work.", "That's awesome! Is it possible to add another day to address this need? Or to have housekeeping come the day of/before?\n\nI don't see any AH here, but if someone has higher standards of cleaning than the other person, it's up to them to bring the baseline to their idea of perfect. This sounds like y'all could use some communication where you agree that XYZ will be done, but if he wants ABC he  needs to step up and pitch in himself. Or someone can lower their standards for peace and harmony because there are only so many hours in the day. I definitely understand house pride but everything looking like Better Homes and Gardens with the workload you both have doesn't seem feasible.", "Right like I said he should definitely help, but it also should not be solely his responsibility either.", "Honestly, because she doesn't have the skills to command a 6 figure salary, not to say she isn't smart enough to put in the effort and do she, she's very smart. She likes being a stay-at-home mom and only started working a part-time job once both kids were in school.", "Same reason you did, I suppose. Because we can.", "Well, we will get a 2-3X ROI a year after I graduate, we agreed going into the marriage that I\u2019d go to grad school, and he is planning a startup, so my going to grad school will allow him to leave his job after he graduates. And honestly, he has a pretty nice life. He would not have been able to work these hours and ruse through the ranks the way he has is I\u2019d been working full time and he had to split responsibilities 50/50. And my parents supported us during his last (failed) startup, and he hasn\u2019t let me pay back the loan, so I think my labor as a student counts pretty damn much.", "This is a terrible mentality to have", "Labor as a student absolutely counts for something. Grad students aren't just sitting around doing whatever they want all day. There is effort and hard work going into classes and papers and more. The work that goes into higher schooling is basically a job. Don't act like he won't benefit from that aspect of her hard work.\n\nIn another comment she talks about the things she is responsible for. She does most the cleaning, all the cooking, does all the errands, manages the household, takes care of her healthcare needs as well as the rest of the family's healthcare needs, AND is the main caregiver for their kids. All of that is unpaid labor that she does to maintain their lifestyle. All of those things count. All of those things are vital to his way of living. They don't amount to less than what he does just because it's unpaid. \n\nThey obviously have busy schedules. There isn't anything wrong with her asking him to help a little for a game night he also wants to do.", "Oh god, he\u2019s admitted that he couldn\u2019t handle my job.", "It could never be solely on him when she's already doing the daily maintenance.  She said elsewhere on one of these posts she's doing at least an hour of cleaning every day anyway.", "So your comment about having the easier job is really just being nice, right?  I would argue that most women would prefer to stay home with the kids while their husband makes a nice living.\n\nAnd I think most men also prefer this arrangement. But watch everybody get triggered lol.", "No. In my case, I was making a point.", "(After *I* graduate, not after he graduates).", "You make a great point about to start up. Still, you would not have been able to stay home and work on your career if your husband did not have this high stress and high-paying job.\n\nBut it sounds like a pretty equal arrangement. Are your kids in school?", "How come?", "Based on OP\u2019s subsequent comments, I agree that in this specific instance her grad school does benefit him. But many times, it doesn\u2019t. The husband is already making a lot of money and doesn\u2019t need the wife\u2019s money. \n\nIt only benefits her in the event of a divorce, since he makes her more competitive in the labor market. Also, lots of grad students don\u2019t study lucrative fields. They are in the humanities, which don\u2019t translate to high-paying jobs a lot of the time.", "Then what the fuck gives him the right to be THAT condescending toward you!?! AND demand that you do more when he couldn't even do the work you do now??\n\nHe's starting to look less like an asshole in this situation, and more like just a total asshole.", "Maybe you are expecting everyone to get triggered because you're making sweeping generalizations?", "People aren\u2019t \u201ctriggered\u201d. It\u2019s just false. Most women don\u2019t want this. If my husband and I could afford to live on 1 salary, he\u2019d be the one to stay home. We aren\u2019t an outlier. \n\nAlso, income and qualifications doesn\u2019t mean a job is harder day to day. My job pays much more and requires a doctorate in physics. My husband\u2019s job pays less and generally requires an undergrad business degree. His job is still takes a bigger toll on him most days than mine does. And staying home with the baby would be more difficult than either of our jobs.", "Which brings me back to my original reply:\n\nOk, bud.", "Reddit has no problem with sweeping generalizations about men. It\u2019s just when it\u2019s about women.  \n\nIf I said something like \u201cmost husbands with SAHM\u2019s think they can just come home after work and do nothing for the rest of the night.\u201c\n\nThat would not raise an eyebrow.\n\nAnd there\u2019s nothing wrong with sweeping generalization; they are often true. There\u2019s also nothing wrong with women preferring to stay home and care for the home and the kids. I think people subconsciously look down on that type of labor and that\u2019s why they get triggered.", "Which brings me back to my original point:  Why even reply?  You have no point.  Sounds like a last-word comment to me. If that\u2019s all you got, then enjoy your last word\ud83c\udf81"]}
