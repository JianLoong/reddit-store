She probably has a phone, email, multiple social media accounts. It is hard to fathom how you feel apparently incapable of reaching her without going through your ex. More to the point, it\u2019s hard to imagine why you feel satisfied that \u201cI\u2019d have to talk to my ex\u201d is adequate to explain your decision to drop out of this girl\u2019s life.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s not about what you\u2019re legally obligated to do. Also not about whether a bunch of a-hole Redditheads think this girl is, \u201cnot your problem.\u201d At this point I\u2019m just truly confused as to why you don\u2019t feel any motivation to do anything proactive for this girl who had you as something like a dad from the time she was a baby to the time she was entering adolescence, and then had no control at all in the fact that you disappeared from her life after that. I see the comments where you say you\u2019re down to passively wait and see if she comes looking for you when she\u2019s 18.  Cool cool cool.
