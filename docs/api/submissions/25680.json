The daughter doesn't sound like she has done anything wrong. \n\nOP may never have an opportunity to be truly in his step daughters life again, but this is an opportunity to show that he loves her. Paying for her college education would say to her something like \"I am sorry things didn't work out between me and your mother, I hope you have an amazing life and that this can in some way help you to that future. I will always love you.\"  \n\nFrankly I don't see how any parent, whether legally consider one or not, can be with a child from age 1-11 and not love them with all their being.", "This should be the top comment.

It is not common for someone to raise a child (step or not) and not be attached to the child after a decade. Further, what about the kids? Those two kids grew up together. For all intents and purposes, they were siblings, practically like fraternal twins. Divorce happens all the time, but parents don't abandon their children.", "Nta, but I hope you can weed out which friend is telling your business to your ex wife", "Not to mention, she already showed how mercenary she was by not re-marrying so she kept that child support money coming in.", "Also maybe I'm wrong or maybe everyone else is wrong but isn't 7 figures mean 1 million USD?

And he can't spare any money for the girl he raised like a daughter for 10 years?", "Did the part where he had no grounds to fight for visitation was lost on you? Stepparents don't get visitation rights, especially if the kid has both parents. And the break up was messy.", "They were married", "Its not his kids.

I have zero contact with my Mom\u2019s past partners. Also, my Mom never forced my stepfather to pay shit for me or my brother given that my dad was in 100% health and paying child support. Anything he gave us was because we LIVED with him under *my* Mom\u2019s roof. My brother\u2019s kids call *him* grandpa.

Come on.", "Technically true, but a shocking number of people would consider 1.5m to to be \"mid 7 figures\".", "I like that you gloss over the fact that he made no attempt to have any visitation. Rights or not, making a fucking attempt is warranted, don't you think? The child is not her mother and didn't have any say in this situation.", "I don\u2019t know your life, and I don\u2019t know what your wife did during your breakup and divorce. You shouldn\u2019t have to continue a relationship with your ex that\u2019s painful or dangerous to you.\n\nBut your (former, unofficial) stepdaughter is 16? She probably has a phone, email, multiple social media accounts. It is hard to fathom how you feel apparently incapable of reaching her without going through your ex. More to the point, it\u2019s hard to imagine why you feel satisfied that \u201cI\u2019d have to talk to my ex\u201d is adequate to explain your decision to drop out of this girl\u2019s life.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s not about what you\u2019re legally obligated to do. Also not about whether a bunch of a-hole Redditheads think this girl is, \u201cnot your problem.\u201d At this point I\u2019m just truly confused as to why you don\u2019t feel any motivation to do anything proactive for this girl who had you as something like a dad from the time she was a baby to the time she was entering adolescence, and then had no control at all in the fact that you disappeared from her life after that. I see the comments where you say you\u2019re down to passively wait and see if she comes looking for you when she\u2019s 18.  Cool cool cool. That\u2019s really all you\u2019ve got?\n\nSeems like this is entirely about you and your ex, as far as you\u2019re concerned. You came here hoping Reddit would authorize you to tell your ex to fuck off, and you got what you came for. You could see this in a totally different way - that if you can\u2019t manage to send a letter or make a phonecall, the college $ is one way you could send a message to your stepdaughter that you didn\u2019t totally stop thinking about her when you moved out.

And they broke up on bad terms. It's logical that they wouldn't have contact to each other for kids that aren't theirs. If i have a messy break up with a guy, i won't care to see him afterwards. Not for a kid that isn't mine. And again, they're not asking for a relationship here. They just asked for money they're not entitled to. The girl's parents can pay her college", "It doesn\u2019t sound like you even asked", "how is this relevant lmao. he did raise a child for 10 years and even though he doesnt have any legal responsibility to help her out, hes still an ass for not doing so. especially considering that like 50k is like 1% of what he makes in a year. bffr", "after taxes i take home 3-400k a month", "Right, so, we disagree about this. But you are entitled to your opinion. I don\u2019t have a position on whether he\u2019s a \u201cbad guy\u201d or a \u201cgood guy.\u201d He sounds like an alright guy to me. But yes I think he has some emotional responsibility to a child he helped raise.", "I\u2019m aware. But if that doesn\u2019t matter when it comes to OP still trying to figure out a way to have a relationship with his exes daughter (as so many have demanded he should have done) then the ex could have done the same.", "Stepparents don't get visitation. And why would he want yo keep contact with ex after a bad break up?? And who says the girl was even interessed in having a relationship with op??", "yeah lotta the lotta the comments here that supported my actions really sorta rubbed me the wrong way so im planning on getting her a educational trust once i get in touch with a lawyer", "Because of the yta vote.. Why is he an ass for abandoning her kid, but she is not for abandoning his ?  If the ex didn't put money towards a collegefund for her ex-stepson, why should OP for his ex-stepdaughter? After all, starting a business can also lead to bankruptcy.. Op just got lucky.\n\nIMHO, if the gender roles were reversed, the ex wife would be applauded for not letting her ex leech of her.", "If it doesn\u2019t make a difference to you but would make a world of difference to the kid, why not? Can\u2019t take it with u so might as well do good deeds w it.", "That's a really kind thing to do!", "i didnt say she isnt an ass, just that he is? he literally raised that girl from 1 to 11, he assumed the responsibility of being her father and then he abandoned her. (the mom did the same thing, but i am not talking about that because it is not relevant to the question OP posed!). i dont know why you want to say that if the mother did it it means that OP can also do the same thing. They both abandoned the children they raised for ten years and its bad on both sides.", "Because this thread is not about them?", "yes that was the reason i didnt adopt the child so that she could continue to get child support", "Oh definitely. I almost married a woman with kids (went back to the baby daddy). And I never would have adopted them for that exact reason. Because if she went back to him, then I\u2019m paying CS to THEM for HIS kids. (Yes I recognize that if you adopt them they\u2019re YOURS, but you get the point.) Alimony I\u2019ve heard of being sunsetted if the person remarries. But not child support unless an adoption took place.", "But the stepdaughter has two living parents, why isn't it their job to set up a college fund for her?  And I agree they both suck for abandoning their step kid after 10 years, but somehow OP is the only one called out for. The entitlement of the ex wife to OP's windfall is not justified, just as the ex wife wouldn't have a financial obligation towards her ex stepson in case OP was completely broke.  \n\n If OP wants to pay for her education, that is great but after 5 years of no contact, I feel that there is not much of a relationship left that can be salvaged with some $$ alone.", "How is this comment downvoted lmao reddit really is full of incels", "Spousal maintenance is rarely long term these days; it can be for long-term marriage when spouse maintained the home, think wealthy people and lots of entertaining, or woman is main caretaker for severely disabled children but otherwise, a few years for retraining only, if she wasn't working and skills are outdated", "My Uncle\u2019s divorced and he\u2019s \u201cwith\u201d a fellow divorcee. They had a \u201ccommitment ceremony\u201d and for all intents and purposes are married. But not on paper, because the terms of her divorce are such that if she remarries she\u2019ll lose the incredible amount of alimony she got when she divorced her rich husband."]}
