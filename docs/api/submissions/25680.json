But like another commenter said if you loved this child and want to help you could. If you have the money why not give her a little push. Ultimately it\u2019s your decision.", "So, to clarify, she is not asking for her daughter to have a relationship with you but she wants her daughter to have a good relationship with your money? I am sure she would love to get to know your money better. \n\nInfo:\n\nHowever, you started your relationship with the mother when the children were only a year old. You were together for ten years and divorced for five, so the child lost contact with you at eleven and is now about sixteen? If the mother prevented her from maintaining contact with OP, then I would not hold the lack of communication against the daughter. \n\nYou don't have to hand her money but if she loved you and her siblings and wasn't allowed to maintain contact, maybe you can restart that relationship.", "NTA because :\nYou haven't had contact with stepdaughter over the past 5 years \nIt sounds like ex is gold digging now.\nYou're also providing for your sister who has serious health problems and things like that often get worse in later age\n\nBe aware through (get legal advice about asset protection in your location), that stepdaughter could possibly sue for a chunk of your estate because she was once your dependent", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You didn't adopt her daughter. It's you ex wife's responsibility.", "Maybe this is a crazy take on it, but you raised a child from age 1 to age 11 and then went no contact with her?
