The daughter doesn't sound like she has done anything wrong. \n\nOP may never have an opportunity to be truly in his step daughters life again, but this is an opportunity to show that he loves her.

She probably has a phone, email, multiple social media accounts. It is hard to fathom how you feel apparently incapable of reaching her without going through your ex. More to the point, it\u2019s hard to imagine why you feel satisfied that \u201cI\u2019d have to talk to my ex\u201d is adequate to explain your decision to drop out of this girl\u2019s life.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s not about what you\u2019re legally obligated to do. Also not about whether a bunch of a-hole Redditheads think this girl is, \u201cnot your problem.\u201d At this point I\u2019m just truly confused as to why you don\u2019t feel any motivation to do anything proactive for this girl who had you as something like a dad from the time she was a baby to the time she was entering adolescence, and then had no control at all in the fact that you disappeared from her life after that. I see the comments where you say you\u2019re down to passively wait and see if she comes looking for you when she\u2019s 18.  Cool cool cool. That\u2019s really all you\u2019ve got?\n\nSeems like this is entirely about you and your ex, as far as you\u2019re concerned. You came here hoping Reddit would authorize you to tell your ex to fuck off, and you got what you came for. You could see this in a totally different way - that if you can\u2019t manage to send a letter or make a phonecall, the college $ is one way you could send a message to your stepdaughter that you didn\u2019t totally stop thinking about her when you moved out. Hell you could even tell your ex that you\u2019ll only consider setting up a fund if she agrees to let you communicate with the daughter about it one-on-one, privately and without interference. \n\nBut it sounds like none of this is your problem.", "That\u2019s a cop out. Man up and help the child.", "If she is important to you, set contact up through a 3rd party. \nIf you set a 529 for her, you can control all disbursements, to make sure ex doesn't have any sticky fingers.\nMom would surely have some give In contact structure when this is presented, if she is truly concerned about her education", "So you hate your ex wife more than you ever loved that girl you raised as your daughter for 11 years. Got it.", "Interesting. Me and my friends don\u2019t discuss other peoples money.", "He raised the kid from when she was a baby to age 11. He says himself that they were close the whole time they lived together. That\u2019s an emotional attachment. Certainly for that kid, who had no choice in any of this. She didn\u2019t get to say, at age 11, whether she wanted to hold on to the stepdad who\u2019d raised her from diapers.\n\nYou\u2019ve got no emotional ties to your former stepkids - that\u2019s your life and I don\u2019t know anything about it. But in the OP\u2019s case, based on the specific history he described here, my feeling is: sometimes you do form ties to a kid, and you _should_ feel some responsibility for that kid\u2019s feelings, whether or not that\u2019s easy for you.", "Seriously. This one should be a hard YTA. Comments here make it 10x worse.", "I have not seen anything where OP says he was close with or had an emotional attachment to his step daughter. Living together doesnt mean anything. \n\nI don\u2019t have former step kids.  I was that kid. My parents divorced when i was 2y/o and i had a step dad help raise me till i was 14 y/o. Then we all parted ways. Its pretty normal. I cant recall a family member or friend who remained in contact with a step parent\n\nEdit to add: this guy is already taking care of a kid who isn\u2019t technically his. How many kids, that he did not create, should he be responsible for? Jesus", "Right - to see where OP \u201csays he was close with or had an emotional attachment to his step daughter,\u201d you\u2019d have to read all the way to the end of his actual post, where he says \u201cI was pretty close to her daughter when we were married.\u201d  \n\nYou\u2019re not really reading or thinking about this guy\u2019s post or his stepdaughter, you\u2019re just thinking about your own life. You weren\u2019t close to your stepdad. Fine, no argument, and also almost no relevance to this situation. Your life isn\u2019t this guy\u2019s life. All we have to go on about this guy\u2019s life, and his stepdaughter\u2019s life, is from his post - where he said they were close, and a few followup comments where other people try to say the daughter cut him off and he actually corrects them and acknowledges the daughter didn\u2019t have a choice.\n\nYour argument is basically: \u201cI, MrsLittleSicily, didn\u2019t feel any attachment to my stepdad during or after we were a family. We just lived together. Therefore OP bears no responsibility for _his_ stepdaughter, even though they _were_ close when they were a family. Because\u2026 I don\u2019t mind that I have no relationship with my stepdad.\u201d", "YTA because you just tossed a 10 year relationship  with your step daughter in the bin just because you divorced your wife. From that girls perspective, her dad just fucked off and never contacted her again.\nThis isn\u2019t about the money, you\u2019re just being a shit dad.", "If your ex-wife hasn't let you keep a relationship with her for these 5 years despite you raising her for 10 years, you are NTA. It you willingly let her down after the divorce, Y T A.", "NTA\n\nShe has a dad who can set it up for her.", "NTA. You had not contact with them for 5 years, she only reached out for money. It would be nice to give a kid good start in life, but you have no moral or legal obligations.", "NTA. However it wouldn't hurt to help if you can to someone you watched grow up. That being said it needs to be the daughter that reaches out and the payments should only be done through the school. Don't give anything to them directly. Your ex maybe wanting a paycheck and you SD might just pocket the money and not go into a traditional college (cosmetology). Have it set up some that the money is sent directly to the institution", "Nta whoever you told address them. Your finances are not her business and she is a joke for even trying it. People always pop up when money is involved.", "NTA in essence but if  you do give charity (which I assume you do earning such high figures), she would be the one to give -especially if you did have a bond with her in the past.", "NTA- She is delusional. You owe her nothing. You split everything when you divorced, You had your child, she had hers. It's HER and Her Daughter's Daddy who need to pay for their child's education, not you. You have no Legal or Moral requirement to provide for her child after the divorce-- If she presses then ask her when she's ponying up for your child's expenses??", "Nta", "NTA, but it would be nice to offer her something.", "So you have no contact for 5 years but are supposed to give money.   Swing that back on her and ask her to be honest about what she would do.", "NTA- of course not your responsibility. That being said\u2026have you talked with the girl recently? What does she want to do with her life? Does she actually want to go to college? Does she sound bratty, entitled or coached on what to say by Mom? Depending on everything, you could set up a small trust for her, help her out with college. Not necessarily pay for everything. (The parents should still pay for at least half.) Make certain conditions. The mom doesn\u2019t lay a hand on a penny of the money. & the girl continues to work hard as if she is trying to earn it. (Like a scholarship.)", "Given that you admit you were close to the child when growing up, in her life for 10 years, and losing contact when she was 11 was partially your fault, I do think that helping her with college is the right thing to do. You don't technically have any responsibility here, but you were a bonus parent to this child for many years, don't you want her life to be easier regardless of your relationship with her mother?\n\nIt doesn't sound like it would really make a financial difference to you at all to make a gift that would significantly ease her path. Why wouldn't you do that? To spite her mother? Seems like a petty reason not to show some care to a child you were a form of parent to.\n\nYTA, not because you're reneging on any actual obligation but because it simply is an assholish move to not give a damn about this kid simply because you don't like her mother any more.", "Nta. Just greed. Ignore.", "NTA. Especially if you have next to no contact", "That quote from Clueless comes to mind: \"You divorce wives, not children.\"\n\nCher's dad was awesome.", "\ud83e\udd47", "My therapist can confirm that it's traumatic to just never see people you thought were your family again.

Why would he deal with his ex for years when the kid isn't his?? I know reddit aita has weird expections about stepparents, but come on.\n\n Also, ex asks just for money, not for a relationship.", "I think it's more about being a stepparent. They are really hated on this sub, no matter what they do. Stepmothers are more hated actually", "His son isn't his bio child either but he made the decision to raise him. The difference is that the piece of paper that brought his stepdaughter into his life is easier to tear up than the one that brought him his son. If it would be a financial hardship for him to help that's one thing, or if the daughter had herself decided to go no contact. But an 11 yr old had zero agency in maintaining a relationship with the guy who helped raise her, and the money would make pretty much no difference to him at his income level. He could cover her tuition and not even notice it, why not make a gesture of care to a child he was close to for nearly her whole childhood?!", "This is a step**father** and people are dragging him for habing no attachment to his ex wifes daughter \n\nThis would never happen if the genders were flipped", "You had a dad from 2 to 14 and never saw him again and do not care? Nobody cares about lineage, the people who care for you are your family.", "In the post he said they were close. Re-read it", ">This would never happen if the genders were flipped\n\nAre you kidding me?? Stepmothers are always eviscerated on aita. It doesn't matter what", "Bs it would the comments would be \n\n\"Good on you queen that leach and his kids dont deserve a cent\"", "No, it wouldn't. Quite the opposite, since she is a woman she would be expected to be nurturing towards all the stepkids. There were so many posts where a stepmom said she didn't want to cook or clean after stepkid and everyone called her an ah cause \"those are her kids too\". Recently there waa a stepmom who wanted her 24yo stepdaughter to share a room with her 5yo halfsister and people were \"you should think of stepdaughter like a daughter too\". Idk what stepmothers posts did you read, but they are very much hated on this sub. So are stepdads, but since they're men thry get a little slack."]}
