Keep a close eye on your kids and if there is any behaviour changes that you can't explain, take them to a therapist.\n\nAt such young ages kids will lie or not understand what happened if there is any SA (which we hope like hell there was none) and it can be difficult for them to open up about uncomfortable situations.\n\nSpeaking from my experience, it all seemed so crazy, I believed I was at fault. As a 2 year old girl already blaming herself for something a 30year old man did to her, there was no way I could talk about it. Any time I thought about it would lead to extreme vomiting. \n\nMy parents knew what had happened and just tried to let it slide. Fix that shit while the kids are young (if anything happened) so they don't have to start trying to heal in their adult lives.", "If your parents are so concerned, they can house your sister.  Your concern is for YOUR children and you are doing what needs to be done.

She should have expressed to you that she was not going to babysit every weekend or that she was feeling overwhelmed or incapable of watching them. You were not wrong to ask her to leave or being angry. You just need to take some level of responsibility yourself for pushing your kids onto her when she was not in a state to be watching them.\n\nEDIT: It's summer (assuming you are in the US) so why doesn't your ex have the kids?", "NTA.

Its an unfortunate situation but you gotta put your children first.", "It might be an easy enough job for her but it\u2019s not her responsibility at all. She\u2019s only 22, going through a traumatic event and wants to go out on the weekends, not be chained to watching kids that aren\u2019t hers. I\u2019m going with YTA for 1. Putting this responsibility on her when she\u2019s going through shit and you know she\u2019s not mentally well. 2. Putting your kids with someone who\u2019s not mentally totally stable. Bad parenting move.", "My neighbor would pick up my kids while I got home and if I knew I wasn\u2019t gonna be home that day I would hire a nanny to watch over them", "NTA.

Wtf", "NTA, but I would be going to pay this random stranger a visit and letting him know you exist and getting a really good handle on how long this had been going on", "NTA", "NTA - children come first. Your parents are acting that way, just say it works the same with you.", "NTA. (Almost went with ESH)\n\nObviously, you shouldn't leave your children with her. Their safety must come first. \n\nBut, could you give her a few days to sort out another place to go?", "Only 22? She's an adult. When we were 19 one of my good friends died in a truck wreck due to gross negligence on behalf of his employer and the slimy bastards didn't have to compensate his 19 year old wife or their 2 daughters who were only 3 and 5, yet she didn't use it as an excuse to fuck off all responsibility to go get shitfaced. She did what an adult that has responsibilities does. She mourned the man she loved, went to work so she could make sure her bills were paid and they didn't end up homeless, and took care of two daughters. And it doesn't sound like OP \"put this responsibility on her\", it sounded like she agreed to help out since he gave her a place to live and needed a hand. If he was aware she was that mentally bad off, then yeah probably bad move trusting her to watch the kids, but she lied and led him to think she was doing as she agreed to and watching them and everything was fine when in reality she left them with some random she met at a f'n bar while she went and got fucked up. She's only 22 or she's going through shit is not even remotely an excuse", "I'm going to be downvoted for this but YTA, you shouldn't have left your children with someone who you even said wasn't in the best place mentally. That wasn't a good choice on your part as a parent. You also hold some of the responsibility in this situation because if you didn't leave them with her in the first place this wouldn't have happened. You are not the ass for removing her from your home", "Wow. All of the N T As are astounding me. This subreddit is really choosing *now* to actually judge the question asked not the major issue at hand. \n\nINFO: how are you not talking to your eight year old enough that you weren't picking up on them spending time getting babysit by strangers MULTIPLE times?\n\nObviously your sister is an AH but this is just bizarre.", "NTA.  Do your parents know the full story?  If they do and still side with your sister then perhaps you should limit communication with them.\n\nTheir grandchild was left with a stranger without parent permission so daughter can club?  I just can\u2019t picture any sane grandparent not being angry", "NTA.  \nI am glad she had someone watch them and didn't  leave them alone - there is no way this was safe and she should have asked you instead of dropping them off elsewhere.    I be insisting she tell you their name and phone number of who she left kids with and having a conversation with them.  How do they know your sister, how often this happen, did she pay them, did they watch the kids at their place or were they at your home (I change be changing keys)?  \n\nI be explaining to your parents she will not be allowed near your kids as she left them in a bad situation and she totally broke your trust.", "NTA. I'm feeling unbelievable rage on your behalf. Who TF does this? Is she mentally incapable of realising how dangerous that situation was? I would cut her off, tell your parents what happened and tell them you will cut them off too if they ever try to take her side on this situation. \n\nAlso, could you report this to the police just in case? Why would a stranger offer to do this? Maybe the police could investigate. \n\nI hope your children were not harmed.", "Nta. That's a tough situation, and I have nothing but empathy for your sister, because I've been there, but just because her world stopped, doesn't mean the world stopped. She still has responsibilities, and right now one of her responsibilities is to your child. I had a similar situation after my fiance died, I moved in with my sister for a while and became somewhat of a nanny for her child. Was it hard? Absolutely. I'm going to be honest, there were most likely times when I did have a Mike's hard lemonade (lol) while I was watching my nephew, to take the edge off. But I NEVER left him alone, or with anyone that my sister and her husband didn't specifically approve of. There were a couple times after I put him to bed that I'd invite a friend over and we'd get drunk and watch movies, but I always made sure to be lucid enough to take care of the baby if needed. \n\nI understand what your sister is going through, and she's in for a very long and painful next few years, but your responsibility is to your child. As much as you love your sister, you cannot do anymore than you've done. Maybe she should go live with your parents for a while, if that's an option. That's what I ended up having to do.", "NTA - Get them to their Dr asap!", "NTA obviously..I hope this doesn't affect your arrangement with your former wife.", "I'm so, so sorry this happened to you \ud83d\udc9c", "Honestly there's a good chance she's suffering from trauma induced insanity. She could have ptsd, traumatic grief, depression, anxiety, and who knows what else, that's just what I had in her situation. The best thing g for her is probably to move home with her parents for a while and get a lot of therapy.", "OP thinks an 8 year old is grown and a 2 year old just needs food and care to be happy. I\u2019m side-eyeing this whole situation. Doesn\u2019t seem like these kids spend much time with either parent. Sad.", "good point especially considering he says his sister isnt in the best place mentally but apparently is mentally sound enough to be trusted with childcare? seems like OP isnt that much more responsible than his sister", "OP's sister is 22, lol.", "If the sister had a problem with an arrangement, she should have communicated that in the first place.\n\nInstead, she chose to endanger the kids.", "Thank you! That line also jumped out to me as indicative of OPs level of engagement with his children.", "An 8 year old isn\u2019t anywhere near grown and a 2 year old isn\u2019t easy\u2026..", "Who gives a shit, they are OPs kids, not his sister's", "This doesn\u2019t justify endangering the kids. Like I said, if the sister couldn\u2019t do it, she should have communicated that.\n\nNow they both can deal with their own situations. OP can look into who can pick his kids up when he can\u2019t and sister can live somewhere else.", "NTA for reacting to your sister leaving your kids with a stranger. \n\n...but asking a 22 year old to be a live-in nanny without pay is a big ask. Obviously you are prepared to live without it since you kicked her out, but it was never a long term solution to put someone in a fragile emotional state in that role in the first place.", "NTA\n\nWhat your sister did was extremely dangerous.\n\nGet a babysitter who is reliable and at your home.\n\nYour patents can take in your sister.", "nta your sister is horrible", "I hate to be that person, but strangers in bars asking for your kids are not good people. You need to find out what happened while they were with strangers. And no, asking the 8y old is not enough. You need to take them to a doctor. NTA and this is so far out of line that I wonder if she sold them.", "NTA", "Your 22 yr old sister is an adult and made extremely poor decisions when it came to your children.\n\nOf course you are livid.\n\nShe has abused her trust.\n\nYour first responsibility is to your children and not to your sister.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I'd be fucking fuming. It's tragic what she's going through, but being self destructive and destructive to others won't help. Someone needs to get hold of her and give her head a wobble.", "Nta. Omg she didn't just leave them with someone that is a stranger to you she left them with someone that even she doesn't know. The things that could have happened..\n. I'm enraged for you. Her fiance passing is tragic and a bummer but people grieve all the time without leaving children to be hurt or worse. You should absolutely not let her back around.

Were your Daughters ok?", "NTA,  regardless if anything bad has happened or not, she endangered the welfare of your children.  I don't know which is more appalling. The fact that she did this or your family is defending her?", "NTA\n\nPlease have your daughters looked at.  Children don\u2019t always know how to tell if something has happened to them.  \n\nVery suspect that some random person at a club wants to babysit some strangers daughters.   Creepy as heck.  \n\nDO NOT allow your sister back or to watch your children.   \n\nThe significant risk she placed them in is ridiculous and \u201cbeing in a bad mental place \u201c is no excuse.", "It\u2019s a good way to get the kids taken away from the estranged spouse too.", "I totally agree. How come the parents open their home up to her?", "I find it very weird the 8 year old didn't mention anything. I wonder if sister told her to keep it a secret. Which is a huge no-no. \n\nI am sorry what you had to go through.", "Sadly there's no \"fixing it\" when the kids are young. It can be handled well or handled badly, but either way, there's some processing and healing that needs to take place when you get older.", "Not even just a stranger- she left them with a stranger she met in a bar!", "Whether they are ok or not is not the point. You do not leave young children with strangers, much less a 2yr old who will never be able to articulate if she suffers any abuse!", "My money is on she put the kids to bed and then left them home alone. She made up them being at a friend's house because it sounds better than she left a two and eight year old alone while they slept. 8 year old didn't mention anything because she never realized she was home alone.", "And like *I* said, at the end of every day, the kids are OPs responsibility and not the responsibility of a 22 y/o whose fiancee just died. His post mentions multiple times \"she isn't in the best mental state\" so HIM leaving the kids with her is the fuck up. And I don't really care what else you have to say about it.", "OP\u2019s sister didn\u2019t have to agree to look after her nieces but even if she was forced into it, leaving two vulnerable children with STRANGERS is beyond irresponsible, regardless of the age of OP\u2019s sister.", "I would repeat the same thing I have already said but you seem to struggle with actually digesting feedback.\n\nSo I will leave you to simmer."]}
