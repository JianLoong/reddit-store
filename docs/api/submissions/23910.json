She has recently lost her fianc\u00e9 in a car accident and has fallen on hard times. I offered her up my home as I had an extra room and she has been living with us for the last couple of months.\n\nI have 2 daughters, 8 and 2. My eight year old goes to school and my 2 year old is in daycare. My sister works in an office at the center of the city weekdays and has the weekends off. I work as a nurse and often have long shifts so my sister picks up my daughters when I can\u2019t. Here is where the issue starts. I have recently found out that my sister goes clubbing every weekend after checking her social media. When I confronted her about it and asked where were my daughters while she went clubbing. She simply told me \u201cat a friends house\u201d. When I ask her who this friend is exactly she told me it was \u201csome who aproached me at the bar\u201d.This made my blood boil. I know it has been rough for her since her fianc\u00e9 has recently died and she isn\u2019t in the best mental state, but that doesn\u2019t excuse her from leaving my children with total strangers and getting drunk every weekend im not home. The idea that something terrible could have happened to my daughters shook me to my core. Out of blind rage I told her to get out and get her stuff.  She isn\u2019t exactly in the best state to be on her own and I have my parents calling me the asshole because I have thrown her out but they don\u2019t seem to understand the extent of the situation. Who knows how many times this has happened and what my daughters have been through. So can sm tell me, am I the asshole?\n\n(Ps I forgot to mention but me and my wife have recently separated after she had an affair and gets the girls summers and holidays.

Your sister is out of line and obviously needs to hit rock bottom before she can grow \ud83d\ude44", "NTA. You are lucky that your kids seem alright. Hopefully your sister gets her life in a good place", "NTA. Your children's safety takes precedence.", "NTA, children come first and regardless of her mental state she should know better then to leave your kids with strangers", "NTA and I'm appalled at the fact that your parents condone her leaving their granddaughters with total strangers.  They need to get their priorities straight.", "NTA. Tell your parents all the details. If they still think Y the A H then something is going on. Like they really really don't want her moving back in with them.\n\nI couldn't share a space with anyone who put my child in that kind of danger.  \n\nYour sister does need help healing from trauma.  I think Colorado already has therapeutic psilocybin sessions, Oregon soon to follow.  A friend held her fiance as he died in the seat next to her after being t-boned. Ayahuasca was what finally healed her.", "NTa -  She is an AH for leaving them with anybody else without your permission, let alone a stranger.\n\nBut did she agree to babysit your children, too, or did she only agree to pick them up? She might have felt taken advantage of and acted out (in a tremendously  stupid and dangerous manner).", "Damn I hope something good happens to you in the near future. This is brutal!", "Your sister is fu-cked up big time. Please have the kids medically checked they might have been s-xually abused already.", "NTA. Your first and only job is the safety and well being of your children. Anything that might threaten that needs to go. Sure, your sister may be in a bad place, but that doesn\u2019t excuse putting your children in danger. And, if your parents don\u2019t see that, they aren\u2019t good grandparents.", "NTA\n\nThat was absolutely irresponsible of your sister. Something terrible could have happened to your kids. \n\nShe also could also seriously jeopardize your custody of your kids if it's found out you're leaving them with an unreliable, dangerous caregiver.", "What do you mean shes not in the best state to be on her own. Is she so mentally ill as to not make reasonable decisions?", "NTA. Just some extra advice.. Keep a close eye on your kids and if there is any behaviour changes that you can't explain, take them to a therapist.\n\nAt such young ages kids will lie or not understand what happened if there is any SA (which we hope like hell there was none) and it can be difficult for them to open up about uncomfortable situations.\n\nSpeaking from my experience, it all seemed so crazy, I believed I was at fault. As a 2 year old girl already blaming herself for something a 30year old man did to her, there was no way I could talk about it. Any time I thought about it would lead to extreme vomiting. \n\nMy parents knew what had happened and just tried to let it slide. Fix that shit while the kids are young (if anything happened) so they don't have to start trying to heal in their adult lives.", "If your parents are so concerned, they can house your sister.  Your concern is for YOUR children and you are doing what needs to be done.  Your sister made terrible choices and essentially lied to you by omission, making you assume she was caring for your children, so that she could party.  That\u2019s unforgivable. NTA.", "NTA - she put your children in danger.\n\nHowever, because of her recent loss, kicking her out feels excessive.\n\nAny chance that you just don't leave her alone with the kids at night? If the problem is clubbing, that will sort it.", "I am going against the grain and saying ESH.\n\nWhy would you leave your children in the care of someone who is going through grief and who you admittedly say is not in the best state of mind? Why would you think that was a good option? This was a bad idea for your sister's sake as well as the sake of your kids.\n\nThat does not excuse your sister leaving your kids with people you don't know at all. What she did was wrong. She should have expressed to you that she was not going to babysit every weekend or that she was feeling overwhelmed or incapable of watching them. You were not wrong to ask her to leave or being angry. You just need to take some level of responsibility yourself for pushing your kids onto her when she was not in a state to be watching them.\n\nEDIT: It's summer (assuming you are in the US) so why doesn't your ex have the kids?", "NTA. I can empathize with your sister, but she shouldn\u2019t have just left your children with a random stranger.", "INFO \nSomeone she met at a bar ten years ago who she has since developed a friendship with or someone she met last night?", "You said your sister picks up your kids when you can't. Then you said she goes clubbing on weekends and you wanted to know where your kids were. So, you are making her babysit? That's on YOU. YOU are the parent, not a fucking 22 year old who is out of her mind with grief. Total YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But it also stands to reason that you cant trust her around your children. And you being a single parent who works so much its not feasible for you to still house her but bar her from being near your kids. Its an unfortunate situation but you gotta put your children first.", "It might be an easy enough job for her but it\u2019s not her responsibility at all. She\u2019s only 22, going through a traumatic event and wants to go out on the weekends, not be chained to watching kids that aren\u2019t hers. I\u2019m going with YTA for 1. Putting this responsibility on her when she\u2019s going through shit and you know she\u2019s not mentally well. 2. Putting your kids with someone who\u2019s not mentally totally stable. Bad parenting move.", "My neighbor would pick up my kids while I got home and if I knew I wasn\u2019t gonna be home that day I would hire a nanny to watch over them"]}
