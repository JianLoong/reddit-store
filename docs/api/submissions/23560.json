It\u2019s reasonable for a spouse to stop working to be a full-time caretaker, and to experience caretaker fatigue.   It\u2019s common for a person to begin to feel that the fight against chronic illness in an elderly person is futile.  \n\nThat\u2019s not to say that you\u2019re wrong.  It\u2019s just possible that your mom is doing her best.   After all, if she\u2019s his caretaker, *his* finances are *their* finances.\n\nCan you volunteer to care for him?   That would take pressure off your mom and instantly clarify whether this is abuse or fatigue.", "\u201cShe\u2019s putting her life on hold for him\u201d.\n\nThis is how a lot of women in that generation feel, because it\u2019s true.\n\nMy grandpa was the crankiest fucker around.

That is normal. And yeah, your mom is making the right choice by making sure he gets compensated if there is money for that. Like, do you know how much cancer costs? And the stuff you don\u2019t think about that\u2019s not covered by Medicare/VA? \n\nN A H for calling APS if you think there\u2019s abuse, but honestly it sounds like your mom is just tired and exhausted, so YTA for saying she \u201cdoesn\u2019t work\u201d when she literal spends every day caring for a disabled person.", "Why do you keep referring to their marital pot of money as his money?

Vietnam era was way before my time, but I still thank every veteran. \n\nYour mother sounds like a greedy person. Your mother is hiding his health issues from you and saying things like \"When he dies\" and that she's \"putting her life on hold for him\". Regardless of the situation, if a loved one is struggling you don't complain like they're a burden. I know if I had a wife that was struggling at that age, I'd be by her side as much as I could. Her attitude sounds like she just wants his money and doesn't care about his life. I honestly hope that when his time comes he doesn't pass in agony, and she doesn't get a cent of anything.

She\u2019s just lazy. \nAbsolutely, I have plans to move closer in December.", "I don\u2019t even want the responsibility of being in charge of the estate, I just want him to be treated well and not be taken advantage of in his golden years", "When my Mum's cancer progressed, my Dad stopped doing most of his voluntary work because looking after her was a full-time job. He'd been retired about five years and very engaged in the community and enjoyed it. But my Mum needed help eating and losing weight as the bone cancer wrecked her. Falls could break all her ribs which is how the bone cancer was found - my Dad was terrified to let her out of her sight. He did put his life on hold for her because she needed him.\n\nBut as a previously independent person, that really irritated her. She wanted to go out on own but between seizures and falls, she just wasn't safe to be on own. And he was in the firing line when the drugs made her feel sick, when she couldn't swallow, when the food tasted like poison. She also recognised that he needed to be able to vent too.\n\nI am not saying you are wrong to get adult services in but also fair chance that nothing beyond the fact your father has cancer and other health issues is happening. Only way you'll get true personal picture is to stay for an extenended time and offer some respite. Considering his long-term ill health, what support does your mother have in coping? And getting an appointment with a specialist in a month isn't bad-going if you listen to the stories of VA hospitals.\n\nAnd if your mother has had to give up work, then yes, she's not unreasonable in trying to safe-guard her future. My parents were eligible for carers' allowance and that was a help to them because cancer isn't cheap even if medical costs covered.  He isn't worried about the money, she may very be because she's his wife and she's about to be destitute.\n\nEdit: when my uncle was dying due to industrial related disaster, yes he went for compensation - it paid for his last days to be better and paid for his funeral. Wonder if the reason your father can claim is exposure to uranium. I'd want the money from the people who are the reason I or a loved one have cancer."]}
