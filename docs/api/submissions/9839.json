{"id": 9839, "submission_id": "11174gu", "title": "AITA for choosing to go on a trip with my girlfriend instead of taking care of my struggling brother's son?", "selftext": "For context: My(24M) brother \u201cLuke\u201d(31M), his wife \u201cEmma\u201d(28F) and their son \u201cKyle\u201d(4m) moved to my city last year because Emma got a new job. They would occasionally ask me to watch Kyle because I work from home with very flexible hours. I personally do not like kids at all but I was happy to do it at the time because I wanted to help them, it was not that often(maybe once or twice every 2 weeks) and Kyle was very well behaved.\n\nNow the issue started near the end of last year when Luke decided to change careers.(He was previously working remotely as well) His new job required him to go to work a lot more often and make substantially less money. This left them depending on me more and more to take care of Kyle. It went from once or twice every 2 weeks to around 3 days out of the week. To make matters worse, Kyle\u2019s behavior changed drastically. To be completely honest I can barely stand the kid anymore, constantly running around and screaming while I\u2019m trying to work and just overall being a little shit.\n\nMy SIL Emma was over the other day picking up Kyle and made some comments about getting rid of some of the \u201cdangerous\u201d furniture in my house like tables with glass edges and stuff so that my home is safer for their son and made a joke about baby proofing my house because they're planning to have a daughter. This pissed me off but I didn\u2019t say anything.\n\nThe situation hit a breaking point last Friday when I was talking about the 1.5 week long trip I was going on with my girlfriend on the 15th (Me and my GF like to travel somewhere nice at least once a month, we could not the past couple months because of Kyle but I promised my GF we would go somewhere exotic for valentines). Upon hearing this they got pretty mad saying who was gonna take care of Kyle, that I need to stop these \u201cchildish trips\u201d and that I need to take more responsibility because \u201cI\u2019m an uncle now\u201d. Im not gonna lie, after hearing this I fucking snapped. I said that their demon child isn\u2019t my responsibility and I\u2019m not just gonna give up my life because they fucked without a condom. It got pretty obscene from there and some horrible things were said. They left and we are no longer on speaking terms. My parents and Emma\u2019s parents are on their side and EXTREMELY angry at me for \u201crefusing to pull my weight\u201d. My parents said that this is my duty and I should be sacrificing everything to help them. It\u2019s honestly got me really down and I've cried my eyes pretty much every day since seeing those messages from my family. I\u2019m starting to wonder if I really should be taking more responsibility.

What\u2019s wrong with your family???", "Nta...if the grandparents don't like it they can babysit the kid. Don't cancel your trip. Kyle is not your responsibility", "NTA. They're taking advantage of your kind nature. Yes, families help each other, but it's not your duty to take care of your nephew, and the fact that everyone started berating you is unfair.", "NTA. Don\u2019t cave in, all of them, they\u2019re just gaslighting you for free childcare, even the grandparents. You have ZERO responsibility to that child, THEY chose to have it, not you.", "2 words of advice.\n\nNO CONTACT\n\nI know it\u2019s hard, they\u2019re family. I get it.\n\nBut families are supposed to value the life, well-being and mental health of EVERY member.\n\nUnfortunately yours missed the memo.\n\nNTA. Put yourself first.", "NTA, they made some bad choices and want you to fix it by becoming a third parent, which you did not agree to. Tell the grandparents to do it if they're so sure that family has to help.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re not responsible for their poor planning, taking a lousy paying job which require brother to be physically be in the office or deciding to not hire nanny or send nephew to childcare etc. They can clean up after themselves easily. If the grandparents are so concern about pulling weight, why aren\u2019t they the grandparents pulling their weight when they are much higher in the hierarchy? Talk about hypocrisy.\n\nAlso you didn\u2019t not sign up to be their childcare provider when they decide to marry and have a child. \n\nBest solution now is tell the grandparents to buck up and take care of their grandchild which they dreamt of(they can always move to the same place) or mind their own business and for brother and Emma to actually be parents and care for their own child instead of freeloading off you. Also you\u2019re done doing them any favors, you have accumulate enough favors from them and it\u2019s high time they start returning it", "NTA- you are working from home and taking care of THEIR child is impacting your work and going on vacation with your girlfriend. \n\nIf anyone should be making sacrifices it should be the parents or grandparents, not the uncle.", "NTA it's their child, not yours...so their responsibility, not yours. Weird af", "NTA the childcare discussion should have happened before your brother made his career change, and should have included you since they were planning on relying on you more. Also do they ever pay you for this?", "NTA. They are a two income household, they can get a nanny or a daycare. Your house isn\u2019t child proofed and you are WORKING and unable to give the full attention required to a child.", "Poor kid is probably acting out for attention he's now not getting from either parent. Of course, it isn't your responsibility to become his de facto guardian. NTA", "WOW.  NTA at all.  You have done more than enough to support your brother and his family.  They don't appreciate the help you have given, and are looking to take advantage of you even more when they have a second child.    \n\n\nYou have done nothing wrong.  Go on your trip, have a wonderful time, and don't give a second thought to your leech of a brother.   \n\n\nIf you ever consider watching your nephew again.  Only do it, if they are willing to compensate you similar to what they would be paying for daycare.", "Absolutely NTA!!\n\nHe is NOT your responsibility, and you have no \u201cweight to pull\u201d in regards to him. You are child free and the only responsibility you have is to yourself. You are under no obligation to watch him. You are his uncle, not his father. \n\nI am assuming you\u2019ve been watching him for free too since you made no mention of whether or not they\u2019ve been paying you. So you have been helping them out. It is not your fault they chose to have a child. That was their choice so it\u2019s their responsibility. Tell both sets of parents if they\u2019re truly concerned they can watch him. \n\nI\u2019m sorry everyone is mad at you, but stand your ground on this. You might have to go LC with your parents for a while until they pull their heads out of their asses. \n\nBest of luck! And have fun on your trip!!", "NTA. Your nephew isn't your responsibility. It's his parents who should be figuring out how to take care of him. You have your own life to live. Enjoy your vacation with your gf!", "NTA. Their kid, their responsibility. If both sets of parents are so set on your brother and SIL needing help, they can do so themselves. Uncles don\u2019t have any responsibility for their niblings. It\u2019s great when you can help, but not required. Your cheapskate brother can pay for daycare or a nanny.", "No, you are not the parent. It is your brother and sister in law responsibility. You have done them a favour and now they are taking advantage - you are entitled to a holiday. Go and enjoy.", "ESH.\n\nFirst, you ALLOWED YOURSELF to be put in this situation. Your nephew is NOT your responsibility. All you had to do was *politely* say, no, I'm sorry, I can't help you with childcare, but would be happy to help out once in a while, like once a month (or whatever.) \n\nSecond, YTA if you called their son \"demon child\" and pointed out they \"fucked without a condom.\" \n\nYour brother and his wife are also TA because they are using you as their daycare, and making you a third parent, when you are not, and expecting you to take responsibility for their child when you are just the uncle.", "NTA Your family are guilting you because non of them can be asked to take care of the son either. Sorry this is happening to you OP but stand your ground you're 100% right. Sounds like your brother and sister in law have become entitled to your help and forgotten what its like to be solely responsible for your kid so they've begun to rely on your help. But as you so rightfully pointed out this is totally a them problem. Your parents are probably joining in because they know if you stop looking after K all together they'll be relied on a lot more.\n\n Also re ur outburst yeh maybe not the best way to react but they pushed you to breaking point and you snapped. Also they were being rude and uneasonable in their expectations so i dont expect you to respond calmly and rationally either", "NTA literally everyone else in this situation is though. You\u2019re and uncle and under no obligation to watch him ever. You have exactly zero \u2018weight\u2019 required to be pulled by you. Enjoy your vacation and your new found freedom and let them parent the child THEY CHOSE to bring into this world while you enjoy the child free stage of your life.", "Although obviously it would have been better if you had calmly sat down before it got to this point and established boundaries, I'll still say NTA, because they clearly have pushed you way too far.\n\nIt is not your duty to sacrifice your own life and relationship for other people's choices, period.   You didn't make them have a child, and I assume you didn't promise them free unlimited childcare as an incentive, either.  They chose to have a child, and your brother chose to change jobs.  It's one thing to help out in a crisis---but months is not a crisis, and their open expectation that you will not only continue to be their (apparently only) backup plan but that they can increase the load on you without your consent is over the top.   \n\nIf you families have a problem with the situation, then they need to step up.  And your brother and SIL have apparently been in your city long enough that they should have other options, whether they are educational programs, paid sitters, or even reciprocal arrangement with other parents.", "NTA\n\nBeing an uncle is not being a parent\n\nYou are doing more than your fair share \n\nAnd the idea that they\u2019re planning to have another child to foist on you? So rude - they are making an assumption you\u2019re just going to be at their disposal and not making appropriate child care plans \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what the child\u2019s behaviour is like for you to not be at fault \n\nI\u2019d suggest you make it clear there will be no more assistance from you - that Kyle is their responsibility but not yours - that you did not get a say in deciding to have Kyle and as such do not have a role to play.\n\nI\u2019d also make it clear now that if they try to drop Kyle off at your house for any reason you will call the police and report him as abandoned. I\u2019d get a video doorbell too just in case but inform them in writing - so a text or email - that you are no longer willing to provide daycare for Kyle and the consequences if they try to force your hand by just dropping the kid off figuring you then won\u2019t have a choice", "Looks like Memaw and Popaw are going to be doing some babysitting since they are the first ones to say family should pull their weight!", "NTA\n\nThey want to control your life for their own convenience. Stop helping. Let them figure out other arrangements for Kyle.", "NTA.  You need to ask why it was okay for them to have a life before having a kid, but it isn\u2019t okay for you.", "NTA.  Not your kid.  You did them a favor and they just kept taking.  Complaining about the safety of your home was beyond the pale.  It\u2019s not a day care facility.  Don\u2019t back down.  Be the fun in jr from now on.  Sugar the kid up before he goes to mom and dad.  Buy him a Bag O Glass.  No rules.", "NTA. What the hell is wrong with your family? This isn't your kid. You didn't choose to be an uncle. Go on your trip and set some boundaries about childcare. It's not your responsibility to provide free babysitting for your nephew, regardless of any behavioral problems (which probably only exist because he is 4).", "NTA. If you didn't make it, it isn't your responsibility. Do not shed one tear over two irresponsible people sponging off a relative. Ask your parents if they're pulling their weight. No where is it mentioned their or SIL parents lives got interrupted.", "Nope. Luke is the golden child in your family, isn't he? You should NOT sacrifice anything to help your older brother. Their kid is not your responsibility. NTA.", "NTA. Now that situations have changed, brother needs to find a more regular childcare solution. OP was happy to help but ultimately caring for the kid full time is not their responsibility.  Change locks if anyone has keys.  Time for parents to step up as grandparents!!!", "Wait what? You have a job. You have to do your job and watch their spawn? You are allowed to live your life. They are taking full advantage of you. Nowhere does it say you are required to be their regular babysitter and sacrifice your job and life because the had a kid... and want another!  \n\nThey'll come around but keep your boundaries firm. Occasional sitting outside of work hours IF you don't have plans. This is THE time in life to travel for you! It's easiest when you are young and don't have kids! GO!\n\nNTA at all.", "NTA. It definitely would of been better to address her just expecting you to provide free childcare to their son when they needed it before it got to the breaking point rather than blowing up, but they\u2019re definitely trying to take advantage of you. Them needing routine childcare should of been discussed first tethering then them just calling here and there for a sitter. \n\nKyle is not your responsibility, he\u2019s theirs!! You are also absolutely not obligated to drop what you\u2019re doing to watch him. That mentality is ridiculous!! They chose to have a child, they can choose to be responsible enough to find adequate care for him!! \nDon\u2019t give in! Go on your trip and enjoy it! If you roll over now, they\u2019ll continue to try and take advantage of you!tell your parents to step up and pull their weight now!", "NTA you didn\u2019t decide to have a child. You didn\u2019t decide to change careers and mess up the childcare. You don\u2019t owe them anything. Do not feel badly for continuing to live your life the way you want to. They chose to move there and they are both adults who can figure it out on their own.", "Nta! Sounds like your parents and SIL parents just signed up to take care of Kyle. If you need to pull your weight, then what are they doing to help? Not that you're required to help at all though.", "NTA, obviously. What a crap family you got there, man. Fuck'em. They are selfish, obnoxious people who dont deserve the help you gave them. They seem like the kind of people, who I would avoid at all cost. Dont let them make you feel bad. Never in my life have I heard that an uncle should do anything near as much you already did and they want to suck you drier even more? Fuck'em, again. The fact that your parents side with them is just very sad. What crappy parents they are, lol. Big loss on the family lottery for you, sorry.", "NTA if They want you to babysit the demonchild They must pay you", "NTA. The family is worried they will somehow have to pick up the slack if you don't. The slack is your brother's kid he can't care for without your help and the threat they may soon have two. You don't have to plan your life around your brothers life. Grandparents are usually the source for free babysitting. So maybe your parents and Emma's parents can step up. Otherwise, it sounds like your brother moved to a city he cannot afford to live in because he can't afford childcare with two incomes, so he should probably think about moving home. Since they decided to have your parents and your SILs parents gaslight you, you have the perfect excuse to never babysit again. Because they are too much drama.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And this month she watched them one evening so we could go out for dinner for my husband's birthday.\n\nBut all those dates I know about 3-4 weeks in advance, and check in with her then, and she knows she can always say no!  And occasionally does.\n\nOther than that, I let her call me up and say she hasn't seen the boys in too long and wants some Aunty Time, and we work out when she's free.  We also invite her to different things like camping and hiking trips, etc. so she sees the boys when she wants to go.\n\nExpecting an aunt or uncle to be part of a regular child care regimen takes discussion and agreement by both parties, and typically some form of compensation!
