We're talking on the phone as I walk into the basement and notice it's flooded. At the time we're talking about possibly ordering sushi for dinner. I immediately go into panic mode and tell her the basement is flooded we need to clean this up ASAP (the sump pump didn't kick on).\n\nSo I'm working my ass off for the last two hours cleaning this up in just total focus mode.\n\nI finally realized my wife isn't home yet (it's now 2.5 hours after she gets off, and we live 10 minutes from her work).\n\nSo I text her and ask if she's coming home.\n\nHer response \"oh I thought you forgot about me\".\n\nAt this point,I admit I was a bit upset with that answer so I responded \"Sorry, I was a little preoccupied....\" but then decided to call her \n\nShe told me I was being an asshole because I never texted her the sushi order.... I responded with \"well uh obviously we have bigger problems, and I could really use some help here what's going on\"\n\nShe responded repeatedly saying she didn't know I needed her help... again remember last time this took 3 hours and 3 people to get it to a safe point.... I'm home alone.\n\nShe them proceeded with just repeating she didn't know I wanted her to help.\n\nI finally just cave because I can tell she's mad at me now, and ask her if she wants my food order. She says \"no I lost my appetite, I'm just going to come home\" then proceeded to hang up on me.\n\nAITA here for this?

She wasn\u2019t waiting for a sushi order. After 20 minutes, she would\u2019ve called to say, \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you given me your sushi order yet?\u201d\n\nShe stayed at work for 2.5 hours hoping you\u2019d be done cleaning when she got home. Or worse yet, she went out and got sushi by herself, which is why she wasn\u2019t hungry anymore when you asked if she wanted your order. \n\nNTA, and she\u2019s gaslighting you.", "So you told her \u201cwe\u201d need to clean it up and then she just sat there for 2.5 hours waiting for you to give her your sushi order?!?! \n\nWhat was she going to do had you never called? She obviously had no intention to call you back.\n\nNTA.", "NTA and I have concerns. \n\nMost people would immediately go \"omg not again! Should I leave work immediately or do you have it handled? What do you need me to do? Call insurance?\" \n\nIt sounds like your wife is either used to you handling everything and not lifting a finger and so there has never been an expectation for her to ever help with anything. Her reaction makes me wonder if this is the case (princess attitude). She was more concerned with sushi and f'ed off for 2.5 hours.", "I would've thought the logical thing would be to come home seeing as you were on with phone with her and found out at almost exactly the same time that the basement was flooded.  \n\nWhat happened when you said it was flooded, did you hang up straight after you said, 'We need to clean it up?' or did you say a few more sentences.  If you just hung up, you would also think that your wife would've called you back to find out what is happening.\n\nHow long would it have been before she would've normally gotten home if the basement wasn't flooded ie would she have gotten the sushi first or were you just thinking about whether to order it but get home first?  Also if she was waiting for your sushi order and you didn't text her back with it... surely she would've messaged you or rang you for it... and then you could reiterate the urgency of needing to clean the basement.\n\nBut I need more info... how long have you been married?  Is this normal behaviour for her?  Does she regularly be so passive aggressive with you and maybe participate in some manipulation, control and maybe some gaslighting?\n\nYou may have to have a close look at your relationship and work out whether you are actually happy and you do actually have a partnership and that you do get on well and work together well... if you don't, then something needs to change.  And definitely before you have kids.\n\nNTA - the whole situation with your wife is odd.", "NTA she is playing ridiculous games in an emergency.  Water damage is very real and very expensive.  The faster you clean it up the better.  I would be beyond pissed at her right now.", "NTA, For context, I'm female and that's a seriously f'd up thing for a wife to do. I would have made that drive in 7 minutes and come careening downstairs to help. Screw the damn sushi order.", "Definitely NTA. I dealt with a flooding basement at my last place, so I definitely understand how big of a problem that is and how much damage it can cause. \n\nIf you were on the phone with her and your tone changed dramatically from causal sushi talk to panicked basement flood freak-out, I feel like any rational person would be alarmed by your abrupt change in conversation and ask what they can do to help or say something reassuring about the situation. \n\nMisunderstanding and miscommunication can happen, but I feel like when you told her, \"hey I wanted you to help me with the basement\" she should've been apologetic, not defensive. Mistakes happen; according to her, she had no clue you wanted help, but being defensive doesn't help. She shouldn't have been mad about the sushi -- that's not even on the same level as the issue you're dealing with.", "NTA. Sushi always comes second to flooding.", "NTA\n\nYour wife's behavior is....well, yeah.", "oh sweetheart....\n\nyou are focusing on the WRONG thing entirely  \nwhere was she for 2.5 hours? she was supposed to be home with food, is she seriously claiming to have waited at the sushi place for 2 hours for your order without contacting you?  \n\n\nthe way she responded, just repeating herself and giving non answers and feigning anger to turn it on you...you need to ask her where she was lol  \ndoes she disappear often without any real explanation?", "NTA but your wife sure is. You aren't being half as harsh as I'd be if my husband left me to clean up that mess alone. Screw sushi and get your ass home and help save your freaking investment.", "NTA. \n\nWife didn't want to get wet and dirty and knew that she could get away with it as you are a guy and dealing with ick is socially prescribed as your job.", "NTA. She knows what she was doing", "NTA. There are two possibilities:\n\n1. she is lying. She didn't want to help, so she decided to make it seem like it's your fault for not replying/paying attention to her so you wouldn't get angry at her. And then she kept \"angry\" and said she didn't want to order anymore as an excuse.\n\n2. She is punishing you because you prioritized something other than her and let you do all this and be passive aggressive with you.\n\nEither option is fucked up", "NTA but your wife 100% is. Wow", "Um where was she all this time?", "Sorry, but is she normally not an intuitive to a crisis situation. My husband is completely clueless unless I spell out what I need or want.  He doesn\u2019t have a learning disability just clueless.", "NTA", "Nta where the heck was she for 2.5 hours????  You told her that the basement flooded. That means - get me whatever food and get home.", "INFO\n\n> we need to clean this up ASAP\n\n> last time this took 3 hours and 3 people to get it to a safe point\n\nNTA about the primary question, but I'm curious about exactly what's happening, and why you keep expressing that there's a **_time crunch_** involved here.\n\n> the basement is finished\n\n> this is the second time the house flooded \n\nWhere is this water coming from? A finished basement is going to be sealed, so did a pipe burst somewhere? Is water still actively coming in?\n\n> (the sump pump didn't kick on)\n\nBut once you discovered the flood, presumably you turned the pump on?", "A few months ago I got a call that water is pouring down to our neighbour. Apparently a pipe burst. Our flat flooded. I was the closest one home, the others were hours away - but they did their best. I ran home. Legit ran. And spent 2.5 hours sweeping water out.\n\nThere is no excuse.\n\nShe just didn't want to work.\n\nAlso water damage is *brutal.* I have so many ruined books, electrical stuff and shoes that I will never be able to replace, and don't even get me started on the huge lump that rose up in the middle of the living room. The wooden flooring is utterly ruined. I cannot imagine what all that water would do to the foundation of the house.", "NAH.. just two people thinking they've communicated well when they clearly have not. \n\n(At least I'm assuming the wife didn't fully appreciate the situation)", "So, you didn't ask her to come home? You didn't ask her to help you clean up? And you also forgot the sushi?\n\nI mean honestly the basement is already flooded. I don't think taking five minuets to call in the order or whatever would have been the end of the world. \n\nI mean, if I was her I would have come home right away. But she isn't a mind reader  either. I've always hated it when folks expect you to just know better, \"you've should have known\" isn't a valid response in my opinion.\n\nESH", "Info after the first time it flooded why didn\u2019t you get a battery back up secondary sump pump? Who\u2019s decision was it not to get a back up system? ESH", "ESH, you for not giving her the sushi order, her for not just coming home.\n\nYou needed to actually tell her you needed her to come home and help.", "I'm going to play devils advocate and consider your wife tried to suggest preventative measures if the sump regularly or often enough doesn't kick in.  You didn't do it and now she's proving she told you so... I could be wrong but that is one reason I personally wouldn't rush home to help.", "ESH. You wanted her to read your mind and she didn\u2019t do the logical thing and come home. Communicate!!!", "ESH. She knew you could use the help, but you really can't leave everyone hanging on food. The 5 minutes it would have taken to call in the sushi would not have made ANY difference to the amount of damage done by the water.\n\nI'm curious what she did for 2.5 hours though.\n\nIt sounds like your basement is a known issue and you're not addressing it properly. Maybe it's time to un-finish the basement or have a better plan than \"panic!\"", "Eh.\n\nToo virginal.\n\nWhat really happened?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
