Someone you brought into your home ignored instructions, used something they were told not to, and broke it. I suppose it\u2019s good that you\u2019re willing to pay instead, but Kim behaved very badly and should pay (really including extra to cover the trouble of remaking the child\u2019s prop chair). I get that you\u2019re concerned about this coming across as shaming her for her weight, but it\u2019s not about her weight, it\u2019s about her behaviour. It was a prop chair for a child, not an actual seat. Everyone was told not to use it, and she didn\u2019t listen. People pussyfooting around bad behaviour like that only encourages it.", "Info - why did Kim sit on the chair?", "why does it have to be awkward? just make a Venmo request. it has nothing to do with weight, it was with her seating there after been asked not to. \n\nYTA", "YTA - She is an adult and was told not to do something, did it anyway, and ended up damaging something that is going to take time and money to fix. Her being plus sized just makes what she did even dumber. Being plus-sized doesn't change the facts or the need for a replacement. Send her a money request, or just pick up your Christmas balls and talk to her directly and tell her you need her to cover the costs of fixing what she broke. If she argues, or trys to play the overweight card, tell her no, you're not, you're playing the 'she's an adult card, and adults cover damages that they cause'.  \n\n\nBottomline, what's more important, your girlfriend or your 'comfort'?", "YTA.\n\nSomeone willfully did something they were specifically asked not to do, and their action caused irreparable damage. It is adulting 101 to be able to handle this. If you\u2019re so passive that you can\u2019t handle something this basic, when it\u2019s this cut and dry, how will you help out / stand up for your partner when it\u2019s more complicated or difficult? \n\nAnd by the way, you should be charging for time/labor on top of material cost. Time is valuable, this was entirely preventable, and your friend/his gf need to make this right.", "YTA. Jen was specifically told not to sit in the chair your GF worked hard on and now she has to redo the whole thing. It's not fat shaming. Jen is an asshole in this situation as well for not respecting your GF's property. If I had my period and bled through on to a couch I don't own, I would need to pay for the damages. That's not women shaming.\n\nEDIT: Kim is a total asshole for not offering to pay for the damages.", "It has nothing to do with her wait. There was literally a sign that said do not sit here and she asked people to not sit on it. Be a mature adult and ask your friend for the money. They need to cover it. YTA", "I think she's annoyed that you're being a pushover. Maybe it's not the first case where she felt you're covering and downplaying your friends/family mistakes and is angry on your behalf. It's completely normal to expect someone to pay for what they broke, even more so if you've warned them well in advance to be careful. You shouldn't feel awkward for asking and if your friends really care for you, they won't be angry if you ask. NAH.", "Yta. Kim deserves to be shamed because she was told not to sit on it and she did it as soon as you were out of the room. You should have asked her for the money right away before she had a chance to escape. Also what about the cost of the labor. Your gf and sister spent hours on it just for this new girl to break.", "YTA. A fat girl was told not to sit on something delicate and she went ahead anyhow, and broke it. Not sure why you\u2019re so worried about shaming her. She needs to pay for this.", "Kind of the AH, if you don't do it your buddy's girl will think it's fine to damage things and walk away. As for the plus-size concern, guess what there was a sign to not touch the chair, based on your description it was clearly a prop not to hold a lot of weight... Doesn't matter if she is plus-sized or a female body builder, both would not break the chair compared to a young child.  If I was your girlfriend without your buddy's bro making amends, I would always generally not want her around.  To be evil can your buddy's girlfriend read?", "Kim is \\*absolutely\\* responsible for covering the costs of repairs. She sat on something that was clearly marked to not be touched. She was also told, like everyone else, not to touch it. But she did it anyway.\n\nThat she's overweight is irrelevant; the chair was designed for a skinny child so any adult would have busted it. She also busted another item.\n\nYour girlfriend is right. You're on the wrong side, here. YTA.", "I guess it\u2019s not too bad, because you\u2018re going to be footing the cost.  But if you were to approach it, the way to do it would be to talk adults vs kids, not plus size.  It was designed for young kids, and so it was made strong enough to support a young kid.  All of the adults were asked not to sit on it because it wasn\u2019t built to support the weight of an adult.  She really did behave badly, sitting on the thing she was explicitly told not to sit on.  She should have offered to repair or replace the thing without being asked.", "YTA, stop being a scardy cat and ask for the repair fees, it\u2019s not attractive to be so afraid of a conversation especially when you\u2019re in the right. Kim is dumb as hell for seeing the sign and still sitting on it", "Kim did the 1 thing she was told not to do. Then when she broke the chair didn't offer to pay for it. Kim is the asshole.", "She broke it and did so after being told not to sit on it. \n\nNeither of them brought up paying to repair it - well that tells you a lot. \n\nPersonally I think you should tell them what it cost to repair and ask them to pay up.  But - as you are prepared to cover the cost I will say NTA except to yourself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your girlfriend wants you to man up and have that uncomfortable conversation to show that you actually will stand up for her and yourself. Don\u2019t be a pushover!", "YTA.\n\nI'm an overweight woman and if I sat on something and broke it, especially after everyone was asked not to sit on it, I would not have left without offering to cover the damages.  It's baffling that Kim would do something like that.  I'm not hugely overweight, but anything that looks a little delicate, I'm not going to see if it takes my weight and that includes actual furniture.  Something made of cardboard wouldn't even be considered.  Kim should accept her responsibility for making a bad decision and replace what she broke.", "INFO:  How much money are we talking about here?  It\u2019s cardboard and gluing the fabric back, right?", "Kim.is a jerk. She needs to cover the cost.\n\nIt is the principle. \n\nCall the guy who brought that idiot over and give him an amount.  Buncha jerks", "YTA. just because kim is fat doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t ask her to replace the chair. did she just sit on the chair to \u201cprove\u201d a point? was she doing it out of spite because she felt slighted? fat people tend to take offense at anything, even if it is unrelated to their weight. man up and fix this now to make it up to your gf. stop being a doormat.", "YTA. Speaking as a fat person, fcking shame her. They\u2019re bad friends and you cleaning up there messes instead of holding them accountable to clean it up themselves is enabling it.", "NAH. She's right that Kim broke it and should pay for it, but if you're willing to pay it then it's only hurting yourself.", "NAH this is one of those life lessons that helps you distinguish true friends from bad friends. Ask your friend and Kim if they can reimburse you for the repair materials, you dont need to mention weight or anything else, its a common thing if you break it you need to replace it. theres two ways this plays out: your friend and kim apologizes once more and offers to pair for damages, in which they are acting like true friends. Or they get defensive, start making a fuss, and refusing to pay, in which case they are acting like bad friends. \n\nthis throne was a prop, i imagine even with the inflated costs of materials it wouldnt cost more than $40 to replace or repair. In which case, $40 well spent to figure out what kind of friend they are, and whether you need to reevaluate your friendship with these people.", "YTA and NTA;\n\nIt\u2019s not your responsibility to be the middle man. Give your gf Kim\u2019s phone number and have her handle it herself, if you don\u2019t have Kim\u2019s number the number of your friend who is dating Kim.\n\nYour gf is in the right to request the funds to fix it.", "Your gf is being ridiculous \n\nAs long as there is time to replace the materials, and fix what was broken\n\nWhy does she care whether you pay for it, or whether you demand your friend pay for it?\n\nThis is the first time your friend brought his gf around, and, yes\n\nShe could have been more thoughtful, and minded the sign, and your request to not sit there\n\nBut I also am certain that if you demanded your friend/his gf pay for what she broke, it would cause damage to your friendship \n\nAnd im guessing you know that, too\n\nYour gf needs to take a chill pill, and let you handle your family, and your friends\n\nIf that means biting the metaphorical bullet and paying for what she broke, and you're okay doing so, then by all means, do so\n\nNTA", "NTA, I would angry, but I wouldn't bother making her pay.  It's Christmas - she should just let it go.", "NTA\n\nIts not really that big a deal but it is shitty that they didn\u2019t offer to pay. They are taking advantage of you.", "NTA. That was nice if you to cover the cost for your friend. Jen should accept your money and be all square on expenses \n\nBut she\u2019s TA for requiring the money to come from Kim. She can express her opinion that Kim should have volunteered it. I agree! \n\nI think you should cheerfully tell your friend and Kim, \u201csorry our sign about the kids\u2019 chair wasn\u2019t clear, that it wasn\u2019t for adults to sit in. I thought Jen was able to tell everyone, sorry that happened. We were able to repair it for the kids to use! Isn\u2019t that wonderful! It cost $xxx.\u201d \n\nThe repetition of how sorry you were that there was a misunderstanding can be face saving. But you cheerfully know they\u2019ll want to cover the cost. \n\nMaybe they will. That would be classy.", "NTA.\n\nIt was stupid of Kim. Who knows why she did it.  How much can cardboard and foam really cost? And if we're talking about the principle of it,  well, the chair was for the nativity,  right? Doesn't really go along with the theme of Christmas to go after you or Kim over cardboard and foam. Actually I spoke too soon,  as I just Googled King Herod... \"tried to have Jesus killed and, in the process, had many children killed / known for his architectural achievements\" Maybe it's on theme after all ..", "Sack up dude.

Or for our dog overlords?", "My cat at least has the sense not to sit on things he knows will not support his weight.", "Again, her weight is irrelevant to her breaking the prop. What's relevant to her breaking the prop is that she decided to sit on it even though the whole group of people that included her was warned not to sit on it. Her weight is only relevant because OP is worried that asking her to pay for it would carry an implication of fat shaming. My guess is that he would not be so hesitant if the person who broke it were thin.", "You've decided with no direct context from OP other than the single use of the term plus size that now she's obese?
