You won't relax, there'll be a ton of tension, and likely enough forced togetherness to really expose how uncomfortable you are, which will create hurt feelings.\n\nBut you can't ignore this guy forever. His place in your mother's life isn't up to you. You need to find a compromise to meet him in person and get a more informed opinion about him than you have now. Maybe mom and BF get a hotel for the weekend and you go out to dinner or do something touristy for the afternoon. Maybe you find time to visit your mom and get a hotel when you've got friends or other siblings around to also hang out with so it's not two days of togetherness.\n\nThen, if you find him personally objectionable and aren't just objecting to the whole premise of their relationship, you can say that you want to limit your interactions with him as much as possible.", "NTA you don\u2019t have to meet anyone you don\u2019t want to.
