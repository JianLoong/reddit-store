A parent having relationship with someone younger than their own children?? Eh I would feel uncomfortable too.", "NTA\n\nYou are not forced to meet your parent's new partner.

I\u2019m going with NTA.  I wouldn\u2019t want to be around that either. Epic awkwardness. Thoughts and prayers.", "NTA.\n\nAnyone is entitled to feel very uncomfortable with a parent dating someone younger than their youngest child. There are reasons that sets off alarms for people. Could it be perfectly healthy? Sure. But moving in together so fast also sends up some potential red flags.\n\nBecause you're not comfortable with this entire situation, it's almost certainly not a good idea to meet and get to know the new boyfriend while hosting him for the weekend. You won't relax, there'll be a ton of tension, and likely enough forced togetherness to really expose how uncomfortable you are, which will create hurt feelings.\n\nBut you can't ignore this guy forever. His place in your mother's life isn't up to you. You need to find a compromise to meet him in person and get a more informed opinion about him than you have now. Maybe mom and BF get a hotel for the weekend and you go out to dinner or do something touristy for the afternoon. Maybe you find time to visit your mom and get a hotel when you've got friends or other siblings around to also hang out with so it's not two days of togetherness.\n\nThen, if you find him personally objectionable and aren't just objecting to the whole premise of their relationship, you can say that you want to limit your interactions with him as much as possible.", "NTA you don\u2019t have to meet anyone you don\u2019t want to. Adults don\u2019t have to become a close, cohesive family, if they aren\u2019t feeling it.", "Dating someone younger than your youngest child is honestly disgusting.\n\nNTA at all.

You are absolutely under no obligations to support this or house them", "NAH. I get how this must be off-putting for you. You don\u2019t have to like your mom\u2019s new boyfriend and don\u2019t have to host him. But your mom can also date who she wants.", "NTA, there is no way this relationship is healthy with such a huge age gap and at completely different life stages.

That age gap is hugely inappropriate. I'd be worried my mom was being taken advantage of.", "NTA I think it's best to be honest and say you just are comfortable with that yet.  It's not even meeting for dinner, it's having a stranger come stay at your home.  Mom can visit you on her own, and if this relationship lasts (hmmm) then you could consider meeting him in the future.\n\nNo offense to your mom, but I highly suspect, with the quick moving in, that this guy is looking for a free place to live.", "[deleted]", "NAH but maybe you get over it by getting to know the guy. If you learn to see him as someone other than just the 23cyear old dating my mother, you may get past the disapproval.", "YTA. You don\u2019t have to let your mother visit you, but you\u2019re picking a very AH reason to not allow it.", "soft YTA.  i understand how you feel, but not allowing him in your presence isn't going to do anything except make you feel better (if only because out of sight, out of mind), and possibly put a strain on your relationship with your mom.  talk to your mom privately and let her know how you feel about it, but don't tell her he's unwelcome before you talk to her or even meet him. \n\nit really is none of your business, and you can't control it or do anything about it.  you can put some space between you and your mom, but again, talk to her about it.  that might be the best course of action, so neither of you builds up resentment for each other.   \n\nmy MO in situations like this (if someone i care about is dating someone questionable), is to get to know them really well, and make sure they are always welcome in my home and around me.  get to know them, make them feel welcome, and they'll eventually be comfortable enough to really be themselves.", "NAH for not wanting to host a visitor.
