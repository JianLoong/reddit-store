Id be uncomfortable as well.", "NTA - and all the Y T A judgments here would be frothing if the genders on this massively out of whack age gap were reversed.", "NAH, the age gap is huge. It's your right whether to accept him or not in your house as it's her right to have a relationship with him so no you are not TA. A parent having relationship with someone younger than their own children?? Eh I would feel uncomfortable too.", "NTA\n\nYou are not forced to meet your parent's new partner. And they're not to force them on you. If you don't want to meet them, that's your right.\n\nEveryone saying yta doesnt realise that you have the right to choose who you come across, especially in your own home", "YWNBTA - you\u2019re an adult and you\u2019re allowed to feel uncomfortable about this. My own mother married someone ~3 years older than me, so my perception could be skewed from that.\n\nHowever, I caution that this might strain the relationship you have with your mother if you can\u2019t figure something out.", "NTA - Just because something is legal doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t give you the ick.", "Eww. I\u2019m going with NTA.  I wouldn\u2019t go either. Epic awkwardness. Thoughts and prayers.", "NTA.\n\nAnyone is entitled to feel very uncomfortable with a parent dating someone younger than their youngest child. There are reasons that sets off alarms for people. Could it be perfectly healthy? Sure. But moving in together so fast also sends up some potential red flags.\n\nBecause you're not comfortable with this entire situation, it's almost certainly not a good idea to meet and get to know the new boyfriend while hosting him for the weekend. You won't relax, there'll be a ton of tension, and likely enough forced togetherness to really expose how uncomfortable you are, which will create hurt feelings.\n\nBut you can't ignore this guy forever. His place in your mother's life isn't up to you. You need to find a compromise to meet him in person and get a more informed opinion about him than you have now. Maybe mom and BF get a hotel for the weekend and you go out to dinner or do something touristy for the afternoon. Maybe you find time to visit your mom and get a hotel when you've got friends or other siblings around to also hang out with so it's not two days of togetherness.\n\nThen, if you find him personally objectionable and aren't just objecting to the whole premise of their relationship, you can say that you want to limit your interactions with him as much as possible.", "NTA you don\u2019t have to meet anyone you don\u2019t want to. Adults don\u2019t have to become a close, cohesive family, if they aren\u2019t feeling it.", "Dating someone younger than your youngest child is honestly disgusting.\n\nNTA at all. I'd tell her the truth, as long as she is dating someone that could be her child, i don't want to see you.", "NAH. You don\u2019t have to be comfortable with their relationship just to make everyone happy But, likewise, your mom doesn\u2019t have to date people her own age just to make you happy.", "NTA\nLet her know you are not comfortable with it and you are not ready for that yet.\nShe is welcome by herself.", "Absolutely NTA- I wouldn\u2019t want my mom bringing a partner younger than me into my home either. You are absolutely under no obligations to support this or house them", "NAH. I get how this must be off-putting for you. You don\u2019t have to like your mom\u2019s new boyfriend and don\u2019t have to host him. But your mom can also date who she wants.", "NTA, there is no way this relationship is healthy with such a huge age gap and at completely different life stages. At 23, you\u2019re either still in uni (like getting your masters) or have only been in the workforce for a few number of years; whereas OP\u2019s mum is 56 and has 4 grown adult kids (all older than her boyfriend) and is getting closer to retirement age (depending on if they are working).\n\nWhat OP\u2019s mum is doing is predatory, I hope her boyfriend has friends who will help him see all the red flags.", "You can choose who comes to your safe space, your house.\n\nAlso, given how quickly they are moving, just make sure she isn't being scammed - giving him all of her money, changing her will to give him everything, etc.", "NTA \n\nYou get to choose who you're comfortable with welcoming into your home. That age gap is hugely inappropriate. I'd be worried my mom was being taken advantage of.", "NTA I think it's best to be honest and say you just are comfortable with that yet.  It's not even meeting for dinner, it's having a stranger come stay at your home.  Mom can visit you on her own, and if this relationship lasts (hmmm) then you could consider meeting him in the future.\n\nNo offense to your mom, but I highly suspect, with the quick moving in, that this guy is looking for a free place to live.", "Mom here.  It isn't up to you to approve.  You are a grownup with your own life.  If you don't want to accept the boyfriend that is your choice but I would hope for the sake of your relationship with your Mom you would be cordial. When this ends and we all know i twill she will need you more than ever.", "NAH but maybe you get over it by getting to know the guy. If you learn to see him as someone other than just the 23cyear old dating my mother, you may get past the disapproval.", "YTA. You don\u2019t have to let your mother visit you, but you\u2019re picking a very AH reason to not allow it.", "soft YTA.  i understand how you feel, but not allowing him in your presence isn't going to do anything except make you feel better (if only because out of sight, out of mind), and possibly put a strain on your relationship with your mom.  talk to your mom privately and let her know how you feel about it, but don't tell her he's unwelcome before you talk to her or even meet him. \n\nit really is none of your business, and you can't control it or do anything about it.  you can put some space between you and your mom, but again, talk to her about it.  that might be the best course of action, so neither of you builds up resentment for each other.   \n\nmy MO in situations like this (if someone i care about is dating someone questionable), is to get to know them really well, and make sure they are always welcome in my home and around me.  get to know them, make them feel welcome, and they'll eventually be comfortable enough to really be themselves.", "NAH for not wanting to host a visitor. YTA for thinking you have a say about \u201capproving (or not)\u201d someone else\u2019s relationship. It\u2019s none of your business\u2019s", "Gonna say YTA because you haven't met him and, to be honest, it's not *really*  your business. If he did something that hurt you or something then you'd be in line but I think YTA for this one", "I\u2019m gonna say YTA here. You for making rude assumptions from him when you have hardly met. Just because she has a partner you don\u2019t approve of doesn\u2019t give you the right to uninvited her and Treat her with disrespect", "YTA - it makes sense you\u2019re uncomfortable at first but you have to at least give the guy a chance you never know the situation. Your mom shouldn\u2019t have sprung him on you though", "YTA, Let people bang whoever they want to bang as long as they're consenting adults.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
