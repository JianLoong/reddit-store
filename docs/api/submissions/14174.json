What your parents did when you were little was unfair and kind of mean, not getting you your own cake, or a new dress, and making you feel like you were overshadowed.

This is a FIRST COMMUNION. You know what happens for most kids when they have their first communion? They maybe get a few religious gifts and a cake with their family and maybe a few friends at someone's house or occasionally a banquet hall if their family has money. Meanwhile you sounded like you dropped 5 figures on this party. Everything you described for a kid's party--for any reason, is beyond absurd. Of course your daughter was happy when you did more than most parents do for their kids' birthdays for their entire lives combined. You went over the top. Honestly, you really need to tone it down because if this is \"normal\" for your daughter, it's very likely she's becoming increasingly spoiled. It's not uncommon for people who were neglected or abused in childhood to spoil their kids into being entitled, nasty people.\n\nAlso, spending that much on a communion, which is the acceptance of a deity who encouraged his followers to give up all their worldly possessions to the needy is hilariously ironic. \n\nAll in all I think you should have a frank conversation with your parents about how neglected you felt as a child, and the communion thing just brought it to a head. It's possible they didn't realize how much they neglected or hurt you, and perhaps they'd be willing to rebuild your relatiosnhip.", "YTA- oh geez they didnt throw buckets of cash at you as a child and chose to allow older sister to celebrate a milestone. one that you'd also go through years later.", "10 months ago you were 20 and in college, suddenly you have a child old enough for First Communion?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It doesn't take much for kids to feel loved and appreciated. They don't need fancy things, tons of gifts, big parties, or all the other stuff like this. They just need love, attention and validation--and your daughter obviously has that.

You don't need to give her *everything*. You don't need to try harder and harder - you've already won the battle. She loves you. Instead of spending crazy money on the party, you can work on decorations with your daughter so they are more special, or spend the money on picking out a nice dress with her. *Spend time* preparing with her. You do not want to show her that her worth is the equivalent to dollar bills. It's the inverse of the lesson your parents gave you growing up. \n\nI highly, highly recommend that you talk to a therapist about what you've posted here, because it appears as though you've got some really deep-seated abandonment issues. I feel for that, but your daughter can't always take the brunt of that behavior. Something has to give. \n\nGood luck, OP. Take care.", "Lol.

In my view,  you are absolutely allowed to lay into your mother when she wouldn't stop pushing. Granted, it wasn't really the right time or place, but unless you have felt that kind of pain of knowing your parents DO NOT LOVE YOU as much as they do your sibling, nobody ELSE can judge you or have ANYTHING to say about whether or not your behavior is appropriate. \n\nMOST people will NEVER understand how many nights you cried yourself to sleep, how often you actually WISHED you'd never been born because then you wouldn't hurt all the time, about how you wish you were secretly adopted, because these people do NOT treat YOU as a full member of the family, you are just the pain in the ass kid they don't want but can't get rid of.\n\nI SEE YOU. YOU HAVE VALUE. YOU DESERVE LOVE WITHOUT CONDITIONS. \n\nI am so sorry, but I am also VERY HAPPY you can give your child the honor and respect you don't get from your parents.

Sometimes no contact is one of the best ways to get the healing you need. \n\nYou are an ADULT and ARE ALLOWED to CHOOSE YOUR OWN FAMILY, whether they share DNA with you is irrelevant, choose people who have your back and will be there for you and who accept you as you are. I was NC with my parents and sister for many years. Eventually some of the relationship was repaired, but never fully, because when you feel unloved by your parents as a child due to your siblings consistently being treated better, it NEVER. GOES. AWAY. That hole was created by the actions of your parents being thoughtless, and it is part of your foundational relationship. It is a trauma that can be healed, but there will always be a tiny part of your inner child's heart that is broken and missing. At least when you experience that, even as a kid, you KNOW you can and WILL be a better parent, and that is what you have done, you ARE a better parent and you can feel proud of that.

His thoughts, his feelings, his perception of the issue is WORTHLESS because he didn't get left at school for hours, he didn't get hand-me-downs, etc.\n\nThen proceed to treat his rebuttal to your statement like air; because again, his thoughts on the matter hold NO VALUE.", "WTF?

As long as you're teaching that to your daughter and make sure she'll be secure in your love for her even if she doesn't get as many gifts or as cool a party as last year, you're doing a good job.", "\"I plan on supporting my child.\" \"You're doing a bad job.\"\n\nNormal attitude.", "I was raised Catholic, went to catholic school.
