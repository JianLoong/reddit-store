I grew up down there (in the blue rectangle)((moved out when I went to college at 18)), and now my parents are retired there. My mom says a number of people in their \"active adults\" retirement community are moving out of the state to be \"closer to their adult children\", but we think it's just getting out of Florida. I wish, and she does too, that they could leave, but they can't right now because of stepfather's illness. So I have to suck it up and go down there, even though I despise what Florida is becoming because of DeSantis and the insane people who think he's a savior (sigh). To actively chose to move down there now, especially with a queer, trans, mixed race child is... a choice, and I don't blame you for not wanting to go down there if that's where she retires.", "NTA - you set a very healthy boundary with your mom. She can either find a home not in Florida where it\u2019s safe for you to visit or she can live in Florida and you won\u2019t come visit her. I think that\u2019s absolutely reasonable and her pushing this boundary could actually put you in danger. I\u2019m sorry your mom isn\u2019t being respectful of your safety, OP. I\u2019m proud of you for standing up for yourself!!", "I refuse to step in FL as well. I am not personally affected by their asinine stances. I have other reasons that are good enough for me. Your mom can visit you. You don\u2019t have to go there. NTA", "You might want to have her look at the looming property insurance crisis in FL. Getting your home insured in FL is very expensive and difficult. \n\nNTA - she gets to move where she wants, you get to decide if you want to visit.\n\nEdit for typo that gave the wrong judgment!", "NTA. You should absolutely prioritize keeping yourself safe. She\u2019s effectively walking herself past a sign that says that you may not enter.", "NTA.  I'm a straight white male and I won't set foot in Florida either.", "NTA. Tell her that Dwayne Wade left Florida to protect his trans child despite having businesses there and being the ambassador for the Miami Heat. She doesn\u2019t have to go anywhere or lose anything to protect you. \n\nAlso, other than being a proud liberal, there is no reason I can\u2019t go to Florida, but I will never set foot in the state until the political climate changes dramatically.", "NTA. Sad to say it, I live in Florida. Your mixed race will not provide much concern here - there is a lot of diversity! BUT the politics are as you describe them. The hard part is that there is a slight majority of far right folks. Those of us who are almost equal in numbers do not get represented. If you told me I could have my same job and co-workers in a different state (without the far-right government), I would probably take it. (Although I would hope not to end up in a super cold climate.)", "NTA.\n\nIt's unreasonable for her to expect you to go to a place that's actively passing laws to hurt people like you.", "Nta\n\nFlorida is becoming worse and worse, so it's understandable to not wanna go. The state is doing whatever it can to kill the tourism industry anyways. \n\nYou aren't \"dumping her off\" somewhere, she's choosing to go there. You dump people without their consent. If anything, she's dumping *you* as a daughter to go to fl.", "NTA\n\nBut you need to be clear that your concerns include Florida.  They aren't limited to Florida.  Other states also have the same problems.  But some states don't have such problems, even among those with warm climates.  Tell her you'd be happy to visit her in Hawaii!  And give her a list of states you do feel safe visiting.  \n\nOr better yet, move to upstate NY.  Liberal politics (particularly in the cities), and surprisingly good weather.  Yes, we get snow.  But our natural disasters, even ones as bad as the snowstorm this past Christmas, are straightforward to deal with.  \"Stay home, grab a hot chocolate, wait for the snow to melt.\"  \n\nAlso, since she's disabled and relies on you as an aide, make it clear that she can choose to move - but you can choose not to move.  And you need to focus on your education, building your career, etc.  \n\nWhat would happen to her, with her disabilities, if you were to be hit by the Hypothetical Bus tomorrow morning?  She needs a plan for her care that isn't relying on you doing everything until she drops.\n\nYou might also focus on the fact that Florida has poor resources available to help people with disabilities.  (For pretty much the same reason you'd face problems there.)  Given her age and the fact that she's disabled, I'm guessing that she's relying, in part, on the version of Medicaid designed to help people with disabilities.  Do some research on the benefits she has, as a disabled person, now, where you are, what she'd get in Florida, and what she'd get in a state that has a more robust safety net for people with disabilities.  It's a significant range of situations.", "NTA\nI was born in FL and am still here I want to move so bad. ( shared custody arrangement). I won't be able to move until both of my girls are 18. \nEverytime I read a new news article about a change for the schools hear I get a huge spike in my anxiety. \nIt is hard being here.  All I can do is vote against policies that are against my views. But I do not talk about my insights and views with people.  I never know which way they might lean . Even my own family. I try to teach my girls to care for other people's feelings. And let them know everyone has a right to live how they want but I am always scares for them.

She probably won't be able to get coverage and it's a state frequently hit by hurricanes. I understand your frustration and wouldn't step foot in that state either. You will not be treated kindly down there and it's not worth risking your safety.", "YTA.  Do you think there are no people in Florida who are queer, trans and mixed race?", "NTA, it/'s up to her where she lives, but you're completely allowed to choose to not visit there.  It's her choice, so it's not you whose abandoning her.\n\nBut also curious to know some info - does she know anyone there?  What it her reason for picking Florida?  If it's as easy as putting a pin in a map, there's plenty of other options, but if she has some support there, then maybe go a bit easy on her (whilst still reserving the right not to visit, of course).", "NTA. You're helping her make a fully informed decision, with pertinent information that she can only get from you. Namely that you do not feel safe visiting a state where you can't legally use a public restroom, which will severely limit your ability to visit her.\n\nI am confused though, you currently live with her to help with your disability, was she intending you to move with her? Or is she planning to move to an assisted living facility there.\n\nIf that's the case, I can almost understand: retirement communities are more expensive than many people bargain for and many of them are located in southern states. Florida in particular is attractive because of the lack of Income Tax, which allows meager retirement funds to go further (vs say Arizona).", "NTA - Do not go to Florida.", "YTA. Florida is a diverse state, you might want to visit it and meet real people there before casting judgment on it.\n\nIf you were talking about Saudi Arabia, I would understand your hesitation. But saying that about Florida sounds like putting political grandstanding ahead of your real-life parent.", "YTA. You're judging an entire state based on the actions and attitudes of a few. I think that's just as bigoted as those who judge someone who trans people or POC because of the actions of a few.", "YTA. Get over yourself. The world does not revolve around you. Do you refuse to travel to the entire continents of Africa, Asia, South America and large parts of Europe? I doubt it. You'll be fine in FL, I guarantee it. Actually leave your poor mom alone, let her move to FL and get away from you.", "Soft YTA, you can't dictate where your mom retires. However, you can tell her windstorm insurance is ridiculously expensive & when a hurricane hits it affects the whole state, there will be nowhere to go & ebuilding is horrible.
