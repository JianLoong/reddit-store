I wish, and she does too, that they could leave, but they can't right now because of stepfather's illness. So I have to suck it up and go down there, even though I despise what Florida is becoming because of DeSantis and the insane people who think he's a savior (sigh).

And you need to focus on your education, building your career, etc.  \n\nWhat would happen to her, with her disabilities, if you were to be hit by the Hypothetical Bus tomorrow morning?  She needs a plan for her care that isn't relying on you doing everything until she drops.\n\nYou might also focus on the fact that Florida has poor resources available to help people with disabilities.  (For pretty much the same reason you'd face problems there.)  Given her age and the fact that she's disabled, I'm guessing that she's relying, in part, on the version of Medicaid designed to help people with disabilities.  Do some research on the benefits she has, as a disabled person, now, where you are, what she'd get in Florida, and what she'd get in a state that has a more robust safety net for people with disabilities.

You're helping her make a fully informed decision, with pertinent information that she can only get from you.

Or is she planning to move to an assisted living facility there.\n\nIf that's the case, I can almost understand: retirement communities are more expensive than many people bargain for and many of them are located in southern states.

The world was very different when I was in my 20s and 30s. Places that would've been free as a bird, that we often thought of going to, just aren't anymore. Some older folks, who truly aren't bigots just gave a hard time grasping this, they just can't get why we have to be so vigilant now.", "What laws do they have that makes spending time with your mother at her home unreasonable??", "You are illustrating what I keep telling people. It is not really the people who were born in this state that are the issue. It is that the other states keep letting their old people retire down here. They come and do not want to take care of this state. I really wish they would stop retiring down here.", "Not likely. That is constitutional.", "Hey, OP, Any chance at trading in your mom for this one? I think this one might be better.", "Thank you very much, also I'm stealing those last lines", "She's actually doing fantastic mentally, she's been going back to college and just finished her Bachelors", "I'm more than happy to move just about anywhere else with her, same with my sister and her wife", "Maybe people automatically think caregivers are the daughters.", "Isn't it doing so already lol", "I'd rather take my chances in a place where it's illegal for them to deny me care but thank you. She's the one who chose that risk to birth me, I don't have to choose risk to visit her when she has the option to remove that risk", "Ah, I could go ahead and say again which laws are actually unsafe for a trans person but you've clearly made up your mind that none of that is real so I hope you have a good day in your bubble", "I'll praise God when the traitor Trump is breaking rocks on the Georgia chain gang!", "Ah fascism at its finest", "How many trans people have been arrested in south Florida for this? Give me a number please.", "\"He could only be arrested\" \n\nSir, the cops can hold you for 24 hours *for any reason they want* and the state government has told them to target trans people. They might not have a CASE against him, but they can absolutely DETAIN him. \n\nYou're gay? You should know better than to blindly trust that the cops will always do the right thing.", "Dude, I'm a certified caregiver and nurse. It's an actual career, I just do it for free for my mom since it's my mom and she doesn't charge me to live with her since I'm taking care of her throughout the the night.", "Sounds more like OP is a live-in caregiver role, something like that usually requires payment/salary, even when they live-in. OP is likely saving their mother a fuck ton of money by not having to pay for a live-in caregiver to help her with daily life.", "If I have an emergency while traveling or need to use the restroom while in public in Florida the laws will effect me, laws effect visitors too. I am planning on avoiding places that are blatantly unwelcoming/unsafe for me to visit, yes.

None unless I have a medical emergency", "My son is in the space industry, and has interred at NASA in both Florida and Texas, and finally got a job with a contracted company in Texas, (Houston specifically).\n\nHe has three positive things to say about Texas:\n\n1) It's not Florida,  \n2) It's not Florida, and  \n3) It's not Florida", "\nAnd insurance companies are leaving people high & dry.", "[removed]", "She won't be able to close her loan without insurance. Have her call around for quotes first. She should pale at the cost.", "That was a really good point\n\nMaybe get the addresses of the houses she's considering and look up insurance rates for each.  If the blatant bigotry of the state doesn't deter her, maybe the realities of money will", "Probably, people are usually surprised that I take care of my mom instead of my sister", "fingers crossed", "Also, she's older so it's a bigger medical risk to come visit you. She shouldn't risk her life to visit you either then", "You're being over dramatic, ridiculous and playing the constant victim. Typical whiny liberal.", "Yeah the alphabet mafia fascists are getting way out of line with the help of the establishment and media and all of the manifesting soy jacks. Save our kids! Stop these predators!", "They are very clearly signaling a decision to do so. Why should OP want to be a test case on the legality of this? Before a hostile Supreme Court, no less! Do YOU go places where you could be locked up for using the bathroom?", "So you think it is a law that\u2019s been enacted with no intent to enforce?", "The cops can hold anyone for 24 hours babes for any reason they deem necessary.  \n\nPlease find me the specific guidance from the state that tells law enforcement to devote resources towards the trans community \n\nOr at the very least, read the bill before arguing with me", "[deleted]", "She's a live in caregiver cause she can't support herself. No she isn't. If her mother is sick she needs care they have stuff that pays for bodily fluid maids. My aunt was a quadriplegic from a drunk driving accident where she was the drunk driver. They consistently paid for cnas to come and go from her home. She may not have looked into it because her daughter is caring for her, but she doesn't need the daughter. The daughter needs her or she'd be homeless I bet", "Oh I see what this is a bathroom thing.", "It's unfortunate that she's choosing this so blindly then. Wait until she loses having her child around just to be somewhere like that.", "Cop out answer. So, what laws do they have in that state that cause you to not go there?", "That's about all Texas has going for it. Except it only has 1 coast to be struck by hurricanes.", "Well... not so dry actually.", "Bot. Original comment here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15s3ubq/comment/jwcmjtj/", "Bot.

His mom is going to realize very quickly just how much things will cost without her son around to do the majority of the heavy lifting.\n\nAnd not everyone, especially in the USA, has access or coverage for the type of care you're talking about, instead they rely on family to help.", "Mom wants them to move to continue to take care of her. If you need someone to care for you, you should absolutely take their thoughts into account. Mom is just going to have to go into a retirement home.", "It's a \"I don't want to be arrested\" thing, bathrooms are just pooping stations people have made political.

This is in the us lol. My uncle also got aids from sharing dirty drug needles. He was able to get the same kind of care. In either case, her mother doesn't owe her shit.

I bet this chick would be homeless without her mother", "Yea..I\u2019ll exit the conversation here.", "Okay, have a nice day", "> I currently live with her helping care for her disabilities \n\nDid you learn to read in the Florida Public School system? \n\nAlso, just because some laws won\u2019t affect *you* doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t whole communities whose existence is being threatened by these bathroom, don\u2019t say gay, etc laws.

Also, the transgender law only applies to publicly owned bathrooms.
