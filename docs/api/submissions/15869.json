We aren\u2019t official, because I\u2019m focused on building my own business and she takes things easy after being in an abus1ve relationship with her ex. I\u2019ve been in 2 serious relationships and therefore I loved 2 girls in the past.\n\n**The butt photo**\n\nAlice was hanging out at my place and we were looking at the art on my walls (my mom is a painter and I also have several other collages/pop art pieces). On the shelves I keep a few framed photos: my parents,college friends, my extended family. There\u2019s an upper shelf where I have more such photos.\n\n**One of them is a black and white photo of a butt seen from the side, in jeans, think something like an artistic jeans advertisement, but it\u2019s just the butt. It doesn\u2019t look too NSFW.**\n\nAlice saw it, laughed it off and thought it was either the default stock photo that they put in the frame when they sell it or something meant to be artistic (though she said it was a bit weird), but I told her it\u2019s one of my exes. I liked the photo and kept it, it\u2019s not the first thing you see in my room and I don\u2019t have the typical couple photos of either of my exes.\n\n**Conflict**\n\nAlice said she found it inappropriate, because 1. maybe the ex would feel uncomfortable to know I still keep a fairly intimate photo for everyone to see and 2. she simply felt uncomfortable not being sure how I feel about my ex.\n\nWe got into an argument, Alice said what if we break up and I\u2019ll do the same with her photos?

Bunch of scolds on this subreddit swear to god.", "People are so immature and insecure.", "This is exactly my thought. No one should be keeping photos of their ex\u2019s body for \u201cartistic value\u201d. It\u2019s not \u201canonymous\u201d. He very clearly looked at the photo and thought of the ex since he immediately remarked that it\u2019s her butt. I\u2019m sure whatever he liked to do with that butt also comes to mind whenever he looks at it.", "it's a fully clothed picture without identifiables. what other reason could it be displayed for, if not artistic value...  \n  \nthe internet is a sick place but I don't think it's so far gone we should be jumping to the conclusion that the mans choking his chicken to something he could've gotten off gettyimages.", "only reason I went N T A over N A H personally was the fact that (unless I've read the post wrong) the girl is question is pointedly NOT OP's girlfriend.", "Per the post, photo is clothed- dude's not displaying porn in his room, I think it's fair to say most people would know that's insane to do.  \n  \nWhen trying to give advice you should consider not adopting a grandiose or condescending tone with jabs like \"lil boi\" and \"dumbass\". Most people will stop reading/listening there.", "It's not a nude photo and the girl's not in a relationship with OP.", "people can (and frequently do) date exclusively sans commitment. sex is a fun, healthy and normal part of most adults' lives. it's also generally less risky and less complicated when your amount of partners is limited to one. passing judgment on the guy for assumptions of the nature of the relationship instead of the reality of the information/situation presented is a bit presumptuous.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\n\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_civility)\n\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "Alice also has a good point about how the ex may feel about him keeping such a photo. If I broke up with a guy I would definitely feel weird if he kept a photo of my butt IN A FRAME in his home. Even if the butt is clothed, it\u2019s weird. OP doesn\u2019t seem to respect the feelings of either of these women.", "I'd argue that it isn't even the content but more the act of having a photo in his home of his ex thats the intimate part. If my partner kept a picture, even just a fully clothed one of his ex, I'd be upset. The fact that it's nude is just worse.", "Found the guy that takes upskirt photos and thinks it's OK", "NO just no freaking photos of your ex hanging anywhere! You're so hung up on her it's painfully obviously. Why even go get a new girlfriend when all you think about still is your ex?? Poor girls, one doesn't even know you have a framed photo of an intimate part of her (heck I'm even starting to think you have more she doesn't known about and aren't telling us) and one was lured into a relationship with you where she isn't even the priority over the ex. YTA bruh. I just can't.", "I\u2019m an artist as well, but for me, he\u2019s TA if his ex is unaware of the photo being in his possession and on display. I mostly do life drawing but all of my subjects have given me consent before I turn their bodies into art work. On a personal level, I would be incredibly uncomfortable if I found out that my ex had printed out a photo of me/my body part and had it framed and displayed in his flat.", "but you know that your exes have them on display and it\u2019s your choice to be comfortable with that. you can\u2019t say the same for everyone. people have different boundaries and you can accept them while understanding yours are different", "Same here. I am also an artist with the additional flavour of being both divorced and widowed. There is no way in fuck that I'd ever remove 13 years of history where my partners were featured prominently not only in my life, but also my art. My art is where I deal with a lot of emotions that come up, *especially* the loss.\n\nThis sounds more like a fun art picture that's reminiscent of a good time in life. Pretty innocuous, if I'm being honest. That doesn't mean it isn't important to him, but it's not like a suggestive nude photo.", "Honestly it doesn\u2019t matter if YTA. You\u2019re dating someone who was in an abusive relationship and this makes her uncomfortable. Take the photo down", "She\u2019s gonna ghost you soon bro. Have you told her that you can\u2019t emotionally invest in her? Im going to guess a no.", "Yah but this isn't Springsteens butt. It's his ex's butt. That changes things.", "It's not the nude part. Plenty of people have nude photos in their homes. It's the ex part.", "why are you so against respecting peoples boundaries? like i genuinely don\u2019t understand. it\u2019s great you aren\u2019t an \u201cinsecure prude\u201d but some\npeople are. if your ex is saying hey i don\u2019t like you have this photo of me up in your home, i find it weird. why is so hard to say \u201cokay\u201d and take it down.", ">the mans choking his chicken\n\nlol I was thinking about OP having feelings for his ex, maybe the internet is indeed too far gone I guess", "So you're no longer in touch with your ex girlfriend who you broke up with because she has mental health issues but you still have a profile of her ass hanging up in your room. \n\nCool, cool, cool. Totally normal. Not weird or creepy at all.", "You sound like you need a lot of therapy and education before you are with anyone else\u2019s", "the butt is in jeans. That makes it less sensual IMO", "Is it really that intimate thought? It's a butt in a pair of jeans. Something anyone can see walking outside. It's not like she was wearing underwear or nothing. That I could see being an issue.", "Yeah. This feels like the most accurate statement in this thread. It's not a nude. If it were a random butt in jeans, you could make the \"art\" argument. He's still got feelings", "That is a rather weird picture to have though. What would be worse as a reply to a question \"why are you keeping it?\", I wonder: a) \"oh it's my ex's\" (personal relevance); b) getting vague \"oh I just like it\" and defensive \"why would it matter?\", therefore raising more suspicion and making the \"oh it's my ex's\" reply sound waaaay worse.\n\nYou are right, that's the pic's true value - a memento. OP is NTA.", "You have such a high opinion of yourself, which is hilarious for someone so wrong. \ud83e\udd23", "What has up skirts got to do with anything?", "Who cares what the ex wants? It\u2019s not their picture.", "Why she feels insecure about it isn\u2019t relevant to whether he\u2019s an AH. Her overreaction is the entire problem here.", "Nudes don\u2019t have faces huh???????\n\nSome yes. But spoiler alert: people can take nude photos with their face in them, and do *GASP* \ud83d\ude2e", "Maybe an odd view, but if OP had never said it was an ex- probably not an issue. Once they said it was an ex - TA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course if they didn't mention it and the GF found out later - huge TA for not saying, so ultimately, TA.", "It\u2019s definitely not a grey area??? Like at all??? Pictures like this should always be deleted as soon as the relationship ends. Point blank period. Op is 100000% TA for keeping intimate photos of their ex, & so is everyone else in the comments saying he\u2019s NTA. I haven\u2019t even TOUCHED on the issue of him DISPLAYING this picture in his house! Seriously wtf!!! \n\nEven if he has his ex\u2019s permission to display that photo like that despite their current status, out of respect for his current partner (especially after she expressed discomfort around it), he needs to burn that shit. He should\u2019ve gotten rid of it as soon as he started dating another woman. Idc if it\u2019s \u201cartistic\u201d that honestly sounds like a poor excuse to hold on to something that once was to me. OP YTA", "Lol i got downvotes? Seriously? \nBunch of puritans you lot are! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Exactly, it's a picture of an ass covered in jeans from the side in black and white, I wholeheartedly doubt it's amazing art. He just wants an ass in his bedroom.\n\nHe says they are exclusive but he can't commit. \n\nI think this is not about the art at all.\n\nThis is coming from a writer and someone who dated artists.", "What the fuck does that even mean. You don\u2019t want to support her and lover her but you want to control who she sleeps with. YUCK", "Info: does she know you can't emotionally commit for now?", "so you can\u2019t explain why you\u2019re against respecting people boundaries? \n\nit\u2019s a picture of the ex. if they don\u2019t want a picture of them displayed in someone\u2019s home then just respect that.", "i think it\u2019s pretty fair to say it\u2019s not only relevant but OP is aware that it\u2019s relevant because they included it in the post. OP is questioning if the consequence of his actions that caused an \u2018overreaction\u2019 makes him an asshole knowing fully that the \u2018overreaction\u2019 could or does stem from her previously abusive relationship. OP isn\u2019t saying \u201cam i the asshole for causing an overreaction\u201d he\u2019s asking if his choices in the context of their relationship makes him an asshole. so her reaction isn\u2019t actually the entire problem here.", "I still don't get your point man. As an amateur photographer I have a few thousand portrait pictures. Some of them are obviously from an ex or two. \n\nDo I think that my pictures have artistic value? Absolutely. Do I showcase my ex's portrait/butt/whatever in the bedroom where I sleep with my wife? Hell no.", "I was thinking that you\u2019re wrong - it would be a blue area since it\u2019s jeans, but then I reread and it\u2019s a black and white, so you\u2019re right - it is a gray area :)", "Yeah this is very much a personal thing. I would have no issues with exes displaying artistic photos of me with no identifying information, but I am the type of person who likes this kind of art. I have sensual but not explicit (mostly clothed never sexual) sketches, photos and paintings of people around my house, some I know some I don't, some purchased, some gifted, some personal.\n\nI think it reflects aspects of my personality and taste that are really important to me. I would also take down personal ones if it made my partner uncomfortable and move the others to a more private space but there's nothing inherently wrong with having them.", "I don't think that it'd default to being an asshole, but even if it wasn't an ex I'm pretty sure \"ass shot of another woman\" is in the realm where the GF wouldn't be an asshole if she was unhappy with it.", " it's a clothed side view of a worn pair of jeans. like literally what you see daily in every fashion advertisement ever", "This isn't intimate, they're clothed. Are you saying you'd go and delete every single photo you had of an ex taken from the side? I agree that if current gf doesn't like it he should get rid of it / pack it away somewhere, but you're going too far IMO saying it should have been jettisoned immediately no questions asked.", "It's also not really all that \"intimate\" like some are trying to claim.", "\ud83e\udd23", "Yeah it\u2019s some weird power move to have it on the shelf and not in a box or album.", "I mean yeah. I work in an art gallery and there are nude images and sculptures everywhere. This seems weirdly like Victorian level prudishness. Art is art and we shouldn\u2019t need to cover up art with fig leaves because some people can\u2019t handle looking at the human form.", "She let him take the picture. She has no control over what he does with it.", "Yes.", "If an ex told me they wanted me to delete every picture I had of them, I\u2019d tell them that unfortunately they don\u2019t have that right and wish them well. \n\nRespecting other people\u2019s boundaries doesn\u2019t mean you have to give up yours. \n\nThe ex has no right or claim on which to ask it be taken down. So I can empathize with their desires all I want, but it doesn\u2019t move the needle.", "They included it in the post explaining why they aren\u2019t officially dating. Her overreaction because of her past doesn\u2019t make his having an artistic picture wrong in any way. Her asking him to take it down to comfort her is within her right to ask, and for him to say no. \n\nAll of this handwringing over a picture of jeans is so insane. If someone I was seeing threw a fit over something like that they\u2019d be gone pretty quickly.", "Hmmm. Let\u2019s see: you have a wife, he does not. This isn\u2019t a portrait, yours are. \n\nIf you change all the facts around it may be hard to get the point.", "That is why I said seeing and not girlfriend.", "Lol this guy thinks he\u2019s like super quirky, but really just oblivious.", "There\u2019s a reason ads show the butt, for sex appeal (that felt gross to write \ud83d\ude02). It may not be intimate but it is sexual. The don\u2019t show the knees do they? So you\u2019re right in a way, OP is keeping the pic up because it appeals to him in the same way that ads are going for. Sexually.", "Yeah, all relationship stuff aside OP should take it down for aesthetic reasons alone.", "It is a picture of an ass that op misses the most about his ex.", "Came here looking for this take. Would OP be comfortable if Alice had a photo of her ex that was similar? \nAnd more importantly, does his ex know the photo is still displayed? If so then I\u2019m less creeped out, but if not what a giant row of \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "Why would you care what a fling thinks anyway? Fling indicates your just using them for sex so\u2026", "That doesn't make a difference to his current girlfriend? Which this is about.", "You sure, sure? Because her reaction to the picture (which is legit - it's weird) shows that she feels a bit different about it - or it just showed her again that you're not emotionally available for her and probably won't for some time. Stop being in a relationship if you can't emotionally commit.", "what boundary are you giving up by not displaying a picture of someone when they don\u2019t want you to? the ex does have claim because it\u2019s a picture of them. what aren\u2019t you understanding?", "It's not official and they have only been dating for like 3 mouths she's being weird. I'd stop seeing her", "No they don\u2019t. It\u2019s not a nude or intimate picture, it was assumedly taken with their permission at the time or in a public setting, and therefor the ex has absolutely no claim to it. It isn\u2019t their picture. \n\nAnd if you want to dig in further, unless a picture bears your likeness such that someone can identify you, then you have no privacy claims under any US jurisdiction as far as I know of. \n\nAnd the boundary you are giving up is letting someone tell you what art you are allowed to enjoy in the setting of your own home. Is it not boundary-setting when you don\u2019t let people redecorate your house when they come over?", "Really??", "She's being weird? Lol He has his exes butt on his BEDROOM wall. A butt he used to grab and feel and enjoy. It's naive to think he only glances at it as art. It's weird and creepy. She should be the one to stop seeing him.", "Dude, you really do take up skirt photos, don't you? and then you call the girl weird when she doesn't like it.", "Yes, 100%.", "My mother has a picture of my prom with my ex on the wall, what's the difference?"]}
