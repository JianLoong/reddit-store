We aren\u2019t official, because I\u2019m focused on building my own business and she takes things easy after being in an abus1ve relationship with her ex. I\u2019ve been in 2 serious relationships and therefore I loved 2 girls in the past.\n\n**The butt photo**\n\nAlice was hanging out at my place and we were looking at the art on my walls (my mom is a painter and I also have several other collages/pop art pieces). On the shelves I keep a few framed photos: my parents,college friends, my extended family. There\u2019s an upper shelf where I have more such photos.\n\n**One of them is a black and white photo of a butt seen from the side, in jeans, think something like an artistic jeans advertisement, but it\u2019s just the butt. It doesn\u2019t look too NSFW.**\n\nAlice saw it, laughed it off and thought it was either the default stock photo that they put in the frame when they sell it or something meant to be artistic (though she said it was a bit weird), but I told her it\u2019s one of my exes. I liked the photo and kept it, it\u2019s not the first thing you see in my room and I don\u2019t have the typical couple photos of either of my exes.\n\n**Conflict**\n\nAlice said she found it inappropriate, because 1. maybe the ex would feel uncomfortable to know I still keep a fairly intimate photo for everyone to see and 2. she simply felt uncomfortable not being sure how I feel about my ex.\n\nWe got into an argument, Alice said what if we break up and I\u2019ll do the same with her photos?

Nudes also dont have faces in it but its still the exes body they are displaying for everyone to see.", "it\u2019s not anonymous to her any more though and although you think it\u2019s weird if you read the reason Alice doesn\u2019t want to commit to a relationship you might be able to empathise a little more with why she\u2019d be feeling insecure and why it bothers her.", "do you notice a trend in these comments' blatant misogyny? as if OP didn't state that the woman he is dating wants to \"take it easy\" for her own reasons or that OP choosing to focus on his business or whatever makes him an AH. or that grownass adult women can make their own decisions about who to date and how serious to be. this sub is exhausting sometimes, glad to see your comments/replies a relief", "Are you having a stroke, or what's happening here?\n\nOf course photos can have artistic value, but if said photo is of your ex's butt then it might raise some questions.", "Oh yeah it\u2019s a side view of a butt in jeans. People are assigning a lot of meaning to it. Picture frames go up and are forgotten for years.\n\nI would let OP elaborate further on whether the photo still has much meaning to him. I doubt it does. \n\nI tend to be lighthearted. So for me, a girl who seems insecure or jealous over simple things is a red flag. Particularly since the relationship has only been for two months and they aren\u2019t even official according to OP.", "Wouldn\u2019t the comparable analogy be\u2026 a male butt in jeans? \n\nWhich I think would be totally fine, yeah. \n\nThis would be different if it was analogous to a bulge picture, which would be like a cutout of his ex\u2019s boobs. Idk if I\u2019d even care much then, but it would be more sexual as art for sure.", "I'm aware, look at the topic of the thread then look at their flair. That's why it's funny.", "The photo is not intimate. The butt is wearing jeans for crying out loud. It\u2019s not an explicit nude.", "i want to award this lol", "What you are saying is not the same", "You still didn't explain how it's intimate? It's just a picture. The ex allowed the picture to be taken. She probably doesn't know he has it in his room.\nNo I wouldn't do it but I'm actits man. /s", "Guys have butts you completely changed the scenario. Boobs or genital pic would be closer", "So at what point does the picture come down, the day of the wedding? And the fact that it even comes down at all indicates that it is, in fact, kind of weird to have that photo at all when seeing someone.", "It\u2019s a BUTT covered by JEANS though! \n\n*screams* \ud83d\ude31", "OP and his not-gf know who is in the photo. There is nothing anonymous about it. Maybe to everyone else in the world seeing it it\u2019s anonymous, but not to the only two people this story actually involves.", "Yeah I mean if my ass looks so good in jeans it\u2019s *artistic* I\u2019d be smug too haha", "He\u2019s not telling people, he told the person he is seeing. I imagine most people confide secrets with people they are seeing. \n\nUhm, sure, but nudes are categorically different because there is intimate sexual exposure without consent. \n\nThere is no similar issue with a cloth-covered jean ass. It\u2019s not comparable.", "Just trying to help support your position which is you asking a question and making it clear you already reject their answer without any basis in fact. \n\n\ud83e\udd2d", "It\u2019s actually below the commenter\u2019s point, technically.", "If it\u2019s not her ex\u2019s cock I don\u2019t want to see it on my ceiling.", "Even if we agree that it is a grey area (which I'm not so sure), I think it's a reasonable request from the gf that OP removes the picture. We all make compromises in relationships and this one is not a crazy request.", ">just a beautiful piece of art.\n\nLet's accept that this photo of a butt in jeans is not a beautiful piece of art.", "I think there's a difference between a beautiful, actual piece of art, and a regular photo someone took of their ex's butt in a pair of jeans.\n\nOP said it looks like a magazine clipping. Pretty fricken weird.", "So, if you have a girlfriend, you\u2019re cool with her painting of her nude ex, because, it\u2019s art, right? You\u2019re going to stare at his naked body day after day? And that\u2019s cool with you?\n\nOP\u2014YTA", "I think this sort of thing is very much upto the partner. If she doesn't want it there, just put it away into whatever box you keep stuff by your ex in. If you want a longterm relationship especially, such stuff are easy practice compromises.", "Yes, it is. He literally has a photo of his exes butt on his bedroom wall that he looks at, that isn't just a passing glance. (Like it would be in the street) How can you not understand that?! I very much doubt he just has a passing glance. It's probably in his bedroom for convenience...", "It's intimate because it's a part of his ex he would have liked a lot. Clothing makes little difference. He probably liked touching and grabbing her butt in jeans. That photo is a constant reminder of that. Which makes it intimate and creepy. This isn't some random art model.", "I love how everyone is coming down hard on OP for not getting rid of a jeans butt for a girl he's been seeing for less than 3 months that he doesn't consider to be his gf, and then on another thread people are eviscerating the girl who looked for her not boyfriend of a year and a half's wallet. \n\nMy question is why are ppl like wallet girl and OP's not gf sticking around with people who clearly don't want what they want. They should do everybody a favor, especially themselves, and cut their losses and move on.", "How are you 30", "Then let her go. She doesn\u2019t deserve this crap. Go to therapy.", "I hate this, you can't control emotions anyway, this is just a way to say you only want to fuck her, just say it lol", "Because of your exes butt? Get rid of the picture and maybe you'll have a better shot with someone else.", "He comnent she isnt his girlfriend, just someone he is dating cause he doesnt want to emotionally commit.", "Does she think you are committed to her?\n\nKinda sounds like your stringing her along", "It's absolutely creepy AF.", ">And I\u2019m sure the ex has no idea he still displays that picture, which adds another layer of creepiness to this\n\nYes, this is the part that I feel is creepy and inappropriate.", "Agree with this completely - his current GF even mistook it for the image that comes with a cheap frame, I think calling it beautiful art is a bit of a stretch here!", "Ok, I didn't look at it like that. Thank you for explaining it and not being a typicL redditter.", "Maybe he means they're only going on dates with each other but not officially in the boyfriend/girlfriend zone. Which makes sense, but I feel like he knows it's not going anywhere and is dragging her along, which makes him more of an AH than the photo, honestly.", "I bet dollars to donuts that a stranger could show the picture to the ex and ask if it's artistic? And the ex wouldn't even know it was her ass in the picture.\nIt's a profile pic of a butt in jeans. It not her face of showing her tattoos. It's a picture in his bedroom if he never to the new girl it was his ex it would be a non starter.", "*You* being the keyword here.", ">It's a profile pic of a butt in jeans\n\nIt doesn't really matter to me whether other people can tell if it's me or not. If it's my body part, I have to give my consent for it to be publicly displayed. It's big ick to think otherwise.\n\nAlso, there is no world in which I couldn't tell that a photo of that part of my body isn't my butt (unless you happened to find a butt that looked very similar to mine). Women's butts and hips vary so much person to person, they know when it's theirs."]}
