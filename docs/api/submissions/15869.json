We aren\u2019t official, because I\u2019m focused on building my own business and she takes things easy after being in an abus1ve relationship with her ex. I\u2019ve been in 2 serious relationships and therefore I loved 2 girls in the past.\n\n**The butt photo**\n\nAlice was hanging out at my place and we were looking at the art on my walls (my mom is a painter and I also have several other collages/pop art pieces). On the shelves I keep a few framed photos: my parents,college friends, my extended family. There\u2019s an upper shelf where I have more such photos.\n\n**One of them is a black and white photo of a butt seen from the side, in jeans, think something like an artistic jeans advertisement, but it\u2019s just the butt. It doesn\u2019t look too NSFW.**\n\nAlice saw it, laughed it off and thought it was either the default stock photo that they put in the frame when they sell it or something meant to be artistic (though she said it was a bit weird), but I told her it\u2019s one of my exes. I liked the photo and kept it, it\u2019s not the first thing you see in my room and I don\u2019t have the typical couple photos of either of my exes.\n\n**Conflict**\n\nAlice said she found it inappropriate, because 1. maybe the ex would feel uncomfortable to know I still keep a fairly intimate photo for everyone to see and 2. she simply felt uncomfortable not being sure how I feel about my ex.\n\nWe got into an argument, Alice said what if we break up and I\u2019ll do the same with her photos?

This picture shit is a power play.", "It\u2019s not even a nude. She\u2019s wearing jeans.", "At least one person not jumping to the first feeling. Second thought must give a sense of what we are talking about here. Just an image like you could buy it anywhere. A butt in a jeans.", "That's more appropriate but the butt is no different than a close up of her cleavage. Stop acting the fool. You know you like the butt pick for sexual, not artistic reasons. YTA", "Is this a butt post on a butt post?", "If you are dating exclusively, you are in a relationship. Dating is simply a relationship without exclusivity. So, she is your girlfriend, or at least that's what you communicated to her - unless you specified to her that she is your not-girlfriend when agreeing to be exclusive.", "This is a great response if it\u2019s truly about art,but re reading this post I\u2019m not so sure.", "This is how I feel as well. NAH . I think for myself, I'd move an art piece from one room to another, but I dont see how its important to get rid of it. Were all adults.", "I mean, I had a fairly good sized nude self portrait an ex of mine painted of herself. Beautifully done, not exaggerated or overly kind, just an honest reflection. It was a stunning piece that I kept for years and received a lot of compliments about. Had nothing to do with me having feelings for her or listing after her, just a beautiful piece of art. I think the new partner in this case is allowing their jealousy to make more of it than it is.", "It's a rear end covered by jeans... \n\nIf the not gf of less than 3 months can't handle it, at least she knows early on and can get out now.", "2-3 months.", "You must have a VERY understanding new partner, be single (having partners and splitting up still counts as single), or be very rich.", "Same man. I've dated a guy like OP before. If I could choose between doing that to myself again or absorbing possibly lethal amounts of radiation, guess which I'd choose?", "You and you GF suit each other. Two morons.", "What do you think being committed *is*...? You're already doing it, you just don't want to label it because...who knows. Being hung up on an ex maybe?", "So what is the difference between an exclusive not girlfriend and normal girlfriend? I\u2019m confused.", "Yeah I\u2019m trying to imagine explaining why I have a framed photo of my ex\u2019s bulge on display in my room. There\u2019s no way I could tell my new fling \u201cit\u2019s art\u201d with a straight face."]}
