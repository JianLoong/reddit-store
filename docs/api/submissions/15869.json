We aren\u2019t official, because I\u2019m focused on building my own business and she takes things easy after being in an abus1ve relationship with her ex. I\u2019ve been in 2 serious relationships and therefore I loved 2 girls in the past.\n\n**The butt photo**\n\nAlice was hanging out at my place and we were looking at the art on my walls (my mom is a painter and I also have several other collages/pop art pieces). On the shelves I keep a few framed photos: my parents,college friends, my extended family. There\u2019s an upper shelf where I have more such photos.\n\n**One of them is a black and white photo of a butt seen from the side, in jeans, think something like an artistic jeans advertisement, but it\u2019s just the butt. It doesn\u2019t look too NSFW.**\n\nAlice saw it, laughed it off and thought it was either the default stock photo that they put in the frame when they sell it or something meant to be artistic (though she said it was a bit weird), but I told her it\u2019s one of my exes. I liked the photo and kept it, it\u2019s not the first thing you see in my room and I don\u2019t have the typical couple photos of either of my exes.\n\n**Conflict**\n\nAlice said she found it inappropriate, because 1. maybe the ex would feel uncomfortable to know I still keep a fairly intimate photo for everyone to see and 2. she simply felt uncomfortable not being sure how I feel about my ex.\n\nWe got into an argument, Alice said what if we break up and I\u2019ll do the same with her photos? I\u2019m supposedly TA because I keep a photo that I simply like artistically.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682645920, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131dztv/aita_for_keeping_a_framed_photo_of_my_30m_exs/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Alice definitely gets the impression that you're still thinking about your ex and I can see why. Why else would you keep that picture?!", "YTA. I\u2019m personally thinking this was a power play for you to let your not-girlfriend know how much of a not-girlfriend she really is.", "Yeah, that's fuckin weird!!! Doesn't matter if its \"artsy\". It's someones intimate photo you framed and put up!!!! And not just someone, YOUR EX!!! Of course the poor girl has a problem with it, it shows you're a freak who frames and puts up girls' intimate photos AND its an ex of yours!!! YTA!!!", "YTA that\u2019s not just an artsy photo\u2026 it\u2019s an ex. It is off it\u2019s still up and in your bedroom of all places\u2026.", "YTA - I'm not sure what you expect... You keep intimate photos of your exes displayed on your bedroom wall and seem surprised it would bother anyone you're currently dating. I mean it's your wall, hang whatever you want on it, but you shouldn't be surprised by this reaction in the slightest, no one sensible is going to think any relationship with you is going somewhere serious.", "I'm sorry but I'm having trouble typing a response because I'm laughing so hard.  You seem to realize that displaying photos of an ex is considered bad form but you think keeping a photo of you exes ass is fair game.\n\nOut of curiously, if you're with your \"unofficial \"gf\" and a lady walks by, where do you eyes conspicuously  wander? I'm guessing you're an \"ass guy\".  BTW YTA.", "YTA\n\nAnd you know it. This is more about bragging about it. Also I seriously hope you have your ex\u2019s consent to have that photo up still. If you don\u2019t you\u2019re a creep.", "YTA. When my previous live in partner moved out,  he took one of my metal boudoir pictures with him.  It still bothers me.  I get that he has those images in his head,  but I don't like thinking that he still has the pictures physically.  You should remove it.  Not for your new girl necessarily, but the the girl your used to love....", "Coming from somebody who wouldn't care at all about this soft YTA. \n\nTake it down if you respect this person and want to continue your dating.

I'm surprised you don't just inherently know that, yes, it is an asshole thing to have a picture of your ex's ass framed when you are openly dating someone else and invite this girl over.", "YTA. Take it down and go get some pictures of your own butt to hang all over your apartment.", "YTA. That's so creepy, dude.", "YTA and much respect to Alice for addressing the bigger 'picture' and not only her emotional feelings about it. She makes a good point about the persons in a picture like that not being aware of it remaining where you see it every day, it's creeperish.", "YTA gross", "Lol you're such an ah it's only funny because you can't see it\n\nYTA", "YTA.  You should be replacing the photo with one of your current gf.", "INFO -  **If** this were a longer relationship (not just dating) and your SO were to just find out that it wasn't an anonymous art butt all along, would you be any less or more understanding of a possible objection to it?\n\nHow would you feel if **your** anonymous art butt graced the surroundings of an ex off in the distance?\n\nWhere would you draw the line for ex art within your own home... partial/full nudity, seductive poses, non-anonymous (showing face), etc.?\n\nWhere would you draw the line for what you're comfortable with being displayed in an SO's home?", "YTA", "YTA you should just lie if you want to keep the pic so bad", "OP why you volunteering info when it\u2019s not needed!??

You are just going to string Alice along anyway.", "YTA. Why tf do you even still have that photo hung UP?? How do you not see a problem with it", "Both. It's just a butt in some jeans, what's different from keeping a celebrity butt in your phone or some shit lol. If it was super intimate photos then i can understand but a butt in some jeans?? Lol now YTA for atleast not taking it down or getting rid of it now that you have a new GF.", "My ex did something like this. At first I really didn't mind, but then the mind games started where he began comparing me to other women on tv and how I was lacking and suddenly being in the room with some half naked bondage picture of an ex didn't feel so Innocuous. \n\nYta. If she's uncomfortable, you can simply move the photo out of sight.", "You shouldn\u2019t have any pictures of your ex period, unless you are currently friends.

That's creepy and weird. I don't think it's inappropriate in and of itself, but the fact it's your ex makes it weird. (It also may be weird in general to girls.

Grow up dude.", "Since the photo does not reveal your ex's identity, why would you? Since you like it artistically, treat it artistically. You should get your ex's permission to keep the photo displayed also. I think your GF sounds insecure and did overreact regarding her accusation of your feelings. \nESH", "NTA.\n\nSome of you people are reacting very strangely about a photo of a butt that's covered up and (if I'm reading this right) is unidentifiable to anyone, except whose ever butt it is and OP.  If Alice is threatened by jeaned-up butts, good luck to her.", "NTA.  Tell her her butt isn\u2019t as nice as your ex\u2019s, so there\u2019s no chance of you keeping a photo of it :)", "NTA, you enjoy looking at that photo because it has an artistic value on it. \n\nYour gf needs to chill out.", "NTA!

This is like the most toxic, pathetic sentence I've ever read.", "You can\u2019t be exclusively dating and also not have a gf, that\u2019s not how it works.

You shouldn't be that surprised that your exclusive not-girlfriend may feel some type of way about  a picture of your ex in an somewhat intimate picture is on your wall...in the bedroom. She might think maybe he cant emotionally commit because he still has oucyures up of her in his bedroom to look at wvery night and every morning. I know its probably not like that but still. I mean you haven't been dating that long, it is your place and art is subjective so NTA.\n\nShe has a point about your ex may not like that and doesn't know you have that picture up, but it is in your private residence and if there is no identifying characteristics I guess it is harmless.
