My ex (28M) and I split physical custody 50/50 and this year the court ordered Christmas schedule says I get the kids for 2 weeks straight up until Christmas Day. A few weeks ago, I called my ex and offered to make different arrangements because no one wants to be without their (small) children right before the holidays and his family usually does Christmas on Christmas Eve. \nFast forward to this weekend. My daughter wanted to wear her little heels to church before the swap, not the tennis shoes she wore from dads. So I forgot to send them back. He texted me and asked if I can bring it over. I was working Monday and today I had to be in court (no cellphones). He texted me three times in 11 hours, and as soon as I got out of court I headed his way to put the shoes in the mailbox. I then texted him to let him know. He attacked me saying I don\u2019t coparent and these are her shoes and she needs them (I pointed out that I had multiple pairs of shoes for the kids and with him having them for a week at a time I was shocked he didn\u2019t have more pairs as well). I told him that I\u2019d had a very stressful and emotional day, I don\u2019t have it in me to argue, I\u2019m on the way with the shoes and could we leave it at that. He proceeded to ridicule me, yell (all caps) at me, and call me names. Then he said he would call the cops on me if I put the shoes in his mail box. So I called the police and asked if I could drop off my child\u2019s (apparently) only pair of shoes. They said of course. I then called my divorce lawyer to make sure it was ok for me to keep the kids the two weeks at Christmas. Now my ex is saying I\u2019m vindictive and a lot of other cruel things. I reminded him that coparenting required kindness, patience and understanding and that it goes back through ways and he will still get the kids on Christmas Day. am I the ass here?", "created_utc": 1667951342, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yq2kn7/aita_for_sticking_to_our_court_ordered_visitation/", "score": 695, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's best if you stick to court ordered visitation schedules.\n\nAs a co-parent splitting custody 50/50 he should be prepared with alternative outfits for your children so that these issues don't happen.

In return, you were verbally abused and threatened with law enforcement intervention. \n\nIn future, stick to the visitation schedule the court has ordered. It\u2019s just less messy that way.
