My ex (28M) and I split physical custody 50/50 and this year the court ordered Christmas schedule says I get the kids for 2 weeks straight up until Christmas Day. A few weeks ago, I called my ex and offered to make different arrangements because no one wants to be without their (small) children right before the holidays and his family usually does Christmas on Christmas Eve. \nFast forward to this weekend. My daughter wanted to wear her little heels to church before the swap, not the tennis shoes she wore from dads. So I forgot to send them back. He texted me and asked if I can bring it over. I was working Monday and today I had to be in court (no cellphones). He texted me three times in 11 hours, and as soon as I got out of court I headed his way to put the shoes in the mailbox. I then texted him to let him know. He attacked me saying I don\u2019t coparent and these are her shoes and she needs them (I pointed out that I had multiple pairs of shoes for the kids and with him having them for a week at a time I was shocked he didn\u2019t have more pairs as well). I told him that I\u2019d had a very stressful and emotional day, I don\u2019t have it in me to argue, I\u2019m on the way with the shoes and could we leave it at that. He proceeded to ridicule me, yell (all caps) at me, and call me names. Then he said he would call the cops on me if I put the shoes in his mail box. So I called the police and asked if I could drop off my child\u2019s (apparently) only pair of shoes. They said of course. I then called my divorce lawyer to make sure it was ok for me to keep the kids the two weeks at Christmas. Now my ex is saying I\u2019m vindictive and a lot of other cruel things. I reminded him that coparenting required kindness, patience and understanding and that it goes back through ways and he will still get the kids on Christmas Day. am I the ass here?\n\nEDIT to help clarify some things: \nDaughter is 3, son is 2. They stay unaware of all of our communication. \nWe are supposed to keep clothing, shoes, toys, etc at our houses, they don\u2019t have bags they carry back and forth. \nThe kids Christmas plans haven\u2019t changed. I planned on taking them to visit family out of town the week before Christmas but offered to let him see them some that week instead. It was originally my Christmas Eve with them to begin with, I was offering an olive branch because I wouldn\u2019t want to go two weeks without seeing them (which is in the court order, but it flip flops every year). So now, I am going to take them to see family they rarely get to see. His family lives in town, so they see each other every week.", "created_utc": 1667951342, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yq2kn7/aita_for_sticking_to_our_court_ordered_visitation/", "score": 1475, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There are some ridiculously cute toddler shoes at Wal Mart.  Kids grow fast, so it doesn't really matter if the shoes are of the best quality:  they will last until she grows out of them.\n\nGuy sounds too cheap to have some clothing at his home for his own children.", "So why did you propose changing things in the first place?", "I was attempting to be kind in thinking \u201cman it would suck to go two weeks without seeing the kids\u201d. But when he reverted back to behavior that originally caused the separation I realized that he won\u2019t be doing that for me in the future (when it\u2019s my turn to go two weeks without the kids). I can see that is can be considered vindictive, but at the same time, I\u2019m not taking any time away that wasn\u2019t already my time with the kids.", "Barring cases like abuse, it takes two to divorce. Nobody\u2019s arguing your *legal* right to jerk your ex around. I\u2019m just saying to promise something then recant due to an argument will inevitably result in escalation, which will only harm your children.\n\nETA: At this point I\u2019d just hew strictly to the letter of the agreement - absolutely no modifications or informal arrangements. You won\u2019t be able to count on any goodwill going forward, nor should you extend any.\n\nETA 2: Your patronizing \u201cdad just learns...\u201d Yikes. Guess what? He won\u2019t learn that at all. He\u2019ll learn that your word isn\u2019t good and that he needs to go scorched earth going forward. Enjoy your newly generated conflict. The fact that you feel it\u2019s your place to train your ex like a puppy might have something to do with the failure of your relationship.", "NTA.", "NTA, he is harassing you over a non-emergency. They are her shoes, which means it's her right, and probably destiny, to mislay them from time to time. When he has her, he is responsible.", "NTA - can understand why your not together anymore.\nIn the future, for the time being have all communication in written form.  No direct phone calls.  You may need this later on.", "NTA\n\nYou tried to be accommodating, but your ex went scorched earth over a small issue that you tried to resolve as soon as you were able to.\n\nIf your ex is going to blow up to the point of threatening to call police over shoes, the best thing for the kids is to follow court orders to the letter and keep communication to a minimum to avoid conflicts. You can't have a friendly coparenting relationship if one parent is unwilling, but you can minimize conflicts", "I'm divorced too, from a difficult person. I'd advise learning the gray rock method of communication. Simply put: only say what's necessary. Be as boring to him as a gray rock. In this scenario you could have said I'm bringing the shoes and leaving them at x location. (putting things in mailboxes is illegal in some places). Then mute him. No need for further discussion at all.\n\nSet major boundaries. Due to our circumstances I do not speak with my ex on the phone unless there's an emergency. He's not allowed to come to my door due to entering my apartment and lingering in my doorway.\n\nAlso stick to the court oder by the letter to avoid disputes.\n\nI also of course avoid talking about their father to the kids and from my side, they don't know about our communication. It's a different story on his side.", "As unpopular as this is going to be YTA but in a \u201cf*** me right?\u201d Kind of way. Yours are young but I\u2019ve been at this for 9 years. The lesson here is : don\u2019t offer olive branches. Be kind and polite but don\u2019t go out of your way. It will not come back to you when it is his turn to share. Read the book \u201cco parenting with a toxic ex\u201d the advice is solid. Stay unemotional, stick to the facts which sounds like you do. But don\u2019t give more than you have to unless you\u2019re prepared to have boundaries constantly challenged.", "NTA your ex went off the handle over shoes. You are going back to your court ordered visitation after verbal/text abuse. Cut and dry. Save all of that communication from him to use next time in court. If this is how his anger manifests over something so small... I'm curious what happens when your kids upset him.", "NTA - Don't want to play nice it goes both ways. It's not his time and now he fucked around and found out what happens when being an ass.", "ESH", "ESH. He overreacted, but that doesn't make you not the AH for taking them back. Kids are 2 and 3 now, but you two are setting up to use them as pawns already and this won't improve until you both figure out how to act in the best way for the kids.", "I have been in that boat though, with two kids growing out of shoes almost MONTHLY at that age\u2026 sometimes you need sneakers specially and the only ones that fit are at the other parents but that\u2019s what Walmart is for, 10buck chucks. He is not interested in problem solving, he is interested in causing distress as a means of control.", "And good for you. I can see why he's your ex.", "A lot of Android phones have call recording disabled in the USA, but it's sometimes possible to re-enable it."]}
