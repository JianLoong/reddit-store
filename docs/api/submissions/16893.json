Bet she kicks the SD out", "She probably thinks it\u2019s their \u201cthing\u201d and she\u2019s special because she\u2019s the only one who calls her step daughter by her full name.  The name she doesn\u2019t want to be called.    OP is  super disrespectful.", "ooooo... yikes", "Like, what if she started calling you *\"the bitch that latched onto my dad\"* in front of your friends and family, because, you know, she prefers to call you that?", "I concur - Soft YTA\n\nFor whatever reason, the kid's name effectively has become her initials and she feels strongly about it. I would still expect her full name to be used on occasion (typically in Come to Jesus type situations), but overall that wouldn't be the norm.\n\nI don't know that OP's motivations are sinister here, she may just have wanted to be different, maybe feel special by getting to call the kid by her full name. Obviously that's not what the kid wants.\n\nI think in typical Reddit fashion y'all are overblowing this whole issue. Full name was tried, it failed and it's done now. Stick to the initials.", "The kid wasn't being nasty, she let her know right away that she preferred her nickname (which is her right) and the step mom decided to ignore her preferences (not ok).  A child has agency.  Standing up for herself does not make her nasty.  Being an adult doesn't automatically mean one is correct and that one should be submitted to.  Step mom is the one who needs to grow up.", "You can put whatever you want on a Tombstone. I\u2019ve seen a bunch that had just one name, or included the nickname most knew the person by. \n\nHer kids\u2019 kids would call her Grandma EJ or whatever grandmother name she picks. \n\nHow about you grow up and learn how the world actually works? Because you have a narrow and naive view to think no one ever respects what people preferred to be called.", "So it's ok for an adult to be disrespectful to a child? Respect is a two way street.", "So it\u2019s okay for an adult to disrespect a child because they are adults?", "How so?", "Children are people with feelings and their own likes and dislikes. They deserve as much respect as anyone else.", "EJ never allowed OP to call her name, OP is a entitled selfish AH calling EJ the name OP wanted and not what EJ *wants* to be called. \n\nOP YTA, and actually disrespectful stepmonster sounds better than OP.", "[removed]", "But her name is so pretty \ud83d\ude44", "They laughed at themselves because they literally forgot her name.\n\nEJ told OP not to call her by her actual name, op ignored her and stomped all over the one boundary this kid set. No one else calls her that, why should OP?", "You make an ass out of u and Ming. Why would you do that to Ming? He hasn't done anything to anybody", "Even my doctors offices now have a field for \"preferred name\" and they call me that. I haven't broken the habit of using my own legal first name for making appointments and such, and sometimes they actually get confused because they're looking for my nickname!", "This! I love how simple most of these are. Almost all of them are reducible to a simple question like this. Did you respect the person\u2019s feelings/time/space? No? Then YTA. But there\u2019s always like a page and a half of text explaining their side and why they should be allowed to be an AH. Mental gymnastics of the Olympic caliber. Anywho, enjoy your day stranger!", "Ya, OP\u2019s motives are definitely not benign.\n\nHer SD basically said \u201cplease don\u2019t call me that, I don\u2019t like it and no one else calls me that.\u201d And OP is like \u201cI\u2019ll call you that if I want to.\u201d\n\nIt boggles my mind why she would continue after she first realized her SD didn\u2019t like it.. what was her motive here? It had no upside, no parenting benefits or positive life lessons or anything to warrant deliberately call her SD something she knows she doesn\u2019t like. It literally just comes down to \u201cbecause OP likes the word.\u201d\n\nShe either places zero value on her step-daughters feelings or she actually enjoys pushing her buttons. \n\nEither way, 110% AH.", "Mainly it just seems like OPs intentions were not malicious and it wasn't meant as an insult, she just liked the name.  Also, I've dealt with some sort of similar stuff, my younger brother is named Richard but he goes by Rich .  Literally everyone calls him Rich except my mother, who always calls him Richard.  He doesn't like it but it never has been a big deal, more of just a minor annoyance, but apparently OPs stepdaughter takes it a little harder.  \n\nOP definitely shouldn't do it anymore but it just doesn't seem like a huge deal to me.", "It's that op kept calling EJ by her legal name despite EJ saying she didn't like it. It wasn't just a few times then \"oh sorry, didn't realize u don't like it.\" She continued when EJ said she didn't like it, to the point where she gave up on correcting op", "The kid should be more firm and talk to her father earlier if it was such an issue.\n\nOP should not have pushed in the first place, especially being a step parent. People need to stand up for themselves too. Both can be true.", "I'm not saying that there wasn't a disconnect - obviously OP didn't get it. I would think that now, after this event, it should be crystal clear that the kid has a preference. OP should honor that because if she doesn't, then she really is an AH.", "EJ tried to stand up for herself and OP ignored her. Not to mention that EJ was 9, how well do you think a 9yo \"being firm\" with dad's new girlfriend would've gone over?", "She may have but OP is making it plain that she would ignore it regardless. And a kid shouldn\u2019t have to stand up to their stepparent.", "I mean, op literally said they knew the kid didn't like what op was calling her. Doesn't seem like a disconnect but more that op didn't care that the kid didn't like it", "Oh OP got it. She just didn't give a fuck because her preference overrode EJ's preference in her mind. There is nothing soft about the YTA in this case."]}
