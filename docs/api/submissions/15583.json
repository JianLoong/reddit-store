Good on you.  Good on you.  Give her the best moments of her life and live, make memories.\n\nYour parents are stupid.  \n\nGive that woman all the love you have.", "NTA. Your parents are heartless WTF?\n\n\"throw away my future for some girl\" *you mean the person you love who is DYING????*  What is WRONG with them?", "NTA but your parents do know that she's dying, right?", "NTA but quick question YOU MENTIONTED SHES DYING RIGHT?! THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOUR PARENTS?!", "NTA Jesus Christ have they no compassion at all. You are taking a year off to be with someone you love before you lose them. It\u2019s an incredibly difficult thing to watch someone die and to choose this is a very beautiful and loving thing  A will always appreciate what you\u2019re doing for her, even if your parents don\u2019t.", "Wait, let's set aside the fact the critical fact she is DYING, your parents refer to A, whom you (and therefore they) have known, and subsequently dated, for almost fifteen years as \"some girl\"?  I am having real difficulty getting my mind wrapped around this. NTA.", "NTA. I usually try to formulate some logic/reason behind the behaviors of non-OP in these cause thats how I process things. There is no logic for their behavior. They could've respectfully declined, I would still say they are AH for not giving a legimitae reason (like \"son....you know shes actually a double agent for Qatar? The signs are all there\") but it reads that they are somehow shocked you might marry a best friend whom you've dated/been involved with  for last 4 years.", "NTA your parents are heartless.", "NTA. You are doing something beautiful, assuming being married is something A always wanted to do. Your parents may not understand your relationship- that's their issue.", "Throwing your future away for \"some girl\" isn't what is happening! You are NTA, your parents are total jerks. I would be so proud to have a son with such compassion. Keep your caring heart and lose your hateful parents.", "Your parents are the assholes - especially considering that A has only months to live.", "NTA. You're doing something that you believe in, and I would say is the right thing to do. While I get why your parents might not understand, and be frustrated, their reaction is wildly out of line and without an ounce of compassion or even \\*trying\\* to understand.", "NTA and while they can be selfish about their son, they also need to understand how important it is for you. Go on, take the time off and the next few months would make someone very happy and also be the most rewarding time of your life. You can always get back to things like studies and job and you will always repent and blame yourself if you missed this chance. Just don't have your parents anywhere near the marriage or they might ruin it for you and the rest. Just keep it simple and invite only those who truly care about your happiness, even if its just the two of you. Its all that matter. Wish you well and cherish the time you have with A.", "So sorry that you are going through this and that your parents don't seem to have any empathy for the situation.  You are NTA. Maybe you should have another convo with them.  Let them know that you would love to have their support, but are not interested in their opinion.", "Didn't one of your parents post the other side of this and it go viral a while back. They left out the fact that A was ill and they made it seem like you had only known her like a year or two. If this isn't the same story then obviously there is something wrong with parents nowadays for this to be happening twice... And I say that as a parent. Taking a year off from school or hell fully dropping out of school is not \"throwing your life way\". Like take A out of the equation and it is still your choice if you want to do schooling or not right now. Add A in who you were probably going to marry and spend life with anyways and it is 100% not throwing your future away. It is trying to jam what you thought would be a 50-60 year future into a year at most... Like seriously... And for them to call her \"some Girl\"... Someone who has been in your life since basically you could remember??? \n\nNTA in any way shape or form. But your parents did give you their RSVP already and it is a big fat no with the addition of you pulling the invite anyways. Two less meals to pay for. And honestly no loss either for \"not being welcome anymore\". Do you really want to associate with people who value a piece of paper more than human life??? I wouldn't think so.", "NTA Well fuck, no offense but your parents seem unpleasant given the circumstances. Not only a complete lack of support from them but actively cutting you off, sheesh. You're doing the right thing and could never be the asshole here. Sympathies to you.", "NTA\n\nI'm so sorry that in this time of need for emotional support, your parents have decided to be as heartless as possible... Why are they acting as if they don't know her ?! You have known each other for nearly two decades. Honestly, I would question my relationship with my parents if they behaved like this. Have they ever shown such contempt towards A before ?\n\nYou have time to make some beautiful memories with A. Don't let your parents taint them. I hope you will both enjoy your beautiful wedding.", "Nta your parents sound like a sad bunch.", "NTA\nYour parents lack of compassion is quite astounding but I guess they just don\u2019t want you derailing your life, many who take a year off never go back.  But they should trust that you know what you are doing and be proud of you being willing to be there for someone you care about.\n\nI would just offer one word of caution, if you are married you will become liable for all A\u2019s medical bills.   I\u2019m assuming as she is so young she won\u2019t have life insurance to cover them.  You could end up in a financial hole too big to climb out of.    Average costs of the last 6 MBD is around $115,000.", "NTA", "YNTA, but your parents sure are.", "INFO: Do you think your parents are upset because you\u2019re getting married, or because you\u2019re marrying A specifically, or because you\u2019re withdrawing from college?", "Hold on what\n\n**They basically cut me off saying I\u2019m not welcome \u2026 they always knew A is very special to me but now they\u2019re mad at me for wanting to spend the time I have left with her.** \n\nThis sounds like either you have the cancer or you spoke to her parents.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They are more concerned with your education(which you can always go back to, though it may be difficult) than you doing what's right in/for your heart. Sounds like you will regret if you don't take this time with A, so do it. You are an amazing person at your age to be able to deal with something like this and take such amazing care of someone you love who is terminal. You're doing the right thing and your parents should come around eventually.", "Your parents don't seem to understand how college works. You can take a year off with no negative consequences (as long as you clear it with the college first).  Check with the college, and report back to your parents. Perhaps that will change their view. If not, then the hell with them. \n\nNTA of course.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nBut I do have some sympathy for your parents. They probably don't want you to get too attached to A because the outcome is that you're going to be left alone. Who knows, maybe they can't express this without making you even more upset, so they resort to being the enemy. I may be wrong, but I think they are just trying to protect you and your future.", "Nta, don't worry, you'll make up all that time you \"wasted\" when they need you for help as they get older so you can focus on yourself.", "NTA - your parents are monsters and should be ashamed of their reactions.", "NTA.

Your parents don't know what they have.  Be proud of you for standing up like this, seriously.  Actions will always speak louder than words.", "Your parents understanding of this is seriously skewed.

It's like they're reading a completely different script.", "Did you ask them specifically what they have an issue with.  Wouldn't be able to guess as I have not a single clue what their issue is.\n\nI hope you and your fiance have some great times.", "This. And that he's dropping out of school and they're likely very worried he won't go back.
