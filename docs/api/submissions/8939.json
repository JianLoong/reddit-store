I may be TA because instead of telling her she should act in a certain way and listen to her mom, I told her these feelings were normal but that she would understand her mom much better when she was older. I may also be TA because I told her stories of similar feelings I had when I was her age to make her feel better.

You were trying to teach her to understand and appreciate her mom and then her mom walks in and gives you the very example of how she is. Jumps to conclusions and controlling, just as the Jenna said.", "NTA. No wonder Ellie is having problems with her mom.", "NTA. Maybe if Ellie actually listened to her daughters feelings and thoughts, she wouldn't have to discuss it with someone else.", "Nta. That mom is being overprotective and overbearing. She\u2019s paranoid you\u2019re going to \u201cinfect\u201d her child with wild stories and that she\u2019ll become disobedient. Such an amateur move. You did well explaining things to her child. People don\u2019t understand that you should tell children all those things so they can understand the world better.", "NTA- you did nothing wrong.  Jenna was in a vulnerable position and you helped and tried to get her to understand that issues between moms and daughters happen. I think Ellie is on  the defense about her parenting with Jenna's mood and doesnt see it as help. But you did nothing wrong.", "NTA - You were letting the niece feel heard, understood and respected... which she needs and may not be able to get that from her mother at the moment. This is when kids start to really rely on those outside the home and to have someone older to look up to and confide in is amazing!", "NTA sounds like ellie is indeed as controlling as jenna claimed, i wouldnt be surprised if emotional abuse was going on. you did absolutely nothing wrong and ellie's reaction speaks volumes. and in fact i would keep an eye on jenna for her safety if you're able to, because you never know what is happening behind closed doors, an 11 year old shouldnt have to feel this way.", "NTA,\nSometimes we as parents are too close and need to step back to see the whole picture.\n\nYou\u2019re right, Jenna was feeling down, and it probably was best to let her vent and try to talk her around. \nHer mum on the other hand also needs to learn to reciprocate listening, especially since she\u2019s the adult and should know how to regulate herself.", "NTA. You are a great person for checking in on her and attempting to help mend her relationship with her mother.", "NTA gf's niece has a safe person in you.

Ellie clearly has control issues and now wants to control the conversations you have with her daughter.", "NTA at all", "NTA - I think it's important for adolescents to hear stuff like that from their elders and Ellie not being able to handle her daughter finding out that parents aren't always perfect is a strong indicator that she's TA", "NTA. Often time kids need an adult they can vent to that isn\u2019t their parent or family member. It\u2019s not like this was your first conversation with her, you clearly have a bond and it\u2019s really awesome she felt safe enough to talk to you! \n\nLike you said, she\u2019s at that age where we all(okay, some of us) hate our moms, and I\u2019m sure Ellie is feeling that. She probably overreacted out of fear or possibly insecurity. If she doesn\u2019t want you to talk to her about that stuff, you should respect that for the time being, otherwise you would kinda be an AH", "NTA - You did nothing wrong and everything right.  You could clearly see Jenna was in pain and you offered her an ear, advice and kindness.  You\u2019re a good guy for that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Don\u2019t beat yourself up unless you told her to be wild just to spite mom", "NTA\n\nYou were being very kind and understanding to Jenna while her mother was being controlling. Sounds like Ellie could learn a thing or two from you", "NTA I have had similar convos with my niece by marriage because she felt she could come to me without judgement. I also always told her that she can tell me anything in confidence,  but also if I felt her mum needed to know I would tell her (my neice) and give her a chance to tell her mum herself or ask if she wanted me to tell her. This built up trust between myself, my sil, and my niece. My sil has come to me when she is worried about niece and asked me to talk to her because she is more likely to open up to me. She never asks about the contents of our convos. All she needs to know is if niece is ok. \n\nI think it's wonderful that she can come to you, and your sil needs to be thankful your niece has someone she can turn to. Had she actually listened to you, she would have understood that you were actually doing the opposite of trying to turn her daughter against her.", "Ellie sounds like she doesn't want her daughter to understand where she may be coming from as a parent & just wants her daughter to blindly follow the leader which could lead to bad decision making when she grows older.", "OP is female", "NAH.\nIt's cool that you shared personal experiences. \nIt's also cool for the parent to set boundaries.", "NTA.\n\nIt is not reasonable to expect all adults in Jenna\u2019s life to hide their own histories and adolescent experiences. *Especially* the things they now view as mistakes through their adult eyes. Adults pretending that they were always perfect and obedient and all-knowing is a great way to make teenagers feel like complete failures and/or freaks for having normal adolescent emotions and decision-making skills. Which no empathetic parent would knowingly choose to do, surely. \n\nI think Ellie is parenting from a place of fear, and I think your girlfriend knows it. She is correct - this was an overreaction, and not one you should take to heart.", "NTA. Ellie seems to be unwilling to accept constructive criticism about her overly restrictive and doctrinaire ways.", "NAH\n\nEllie walked in while you were talking about sneaking out, she didn't hear the part when you talked about appreciating your mother in hindsight. She was probably still upset about the fight, too. Without context, it sounded like you were enticing bad behavior.", "YTA", ">\tMaybe if Ellie actually listened \n\nEllie is the parent.

Will TV and internet be banned in the home, lest Jenna see a tv show or a movie in which a teenager gets into a fight with a parent? Is Ellie\u2019s *sister* also forbidden to discuss her adolescent conflicts and screw-ups?

Nowadays, the far right crowd promotes conspiracies and crazy stuff about the \"lgbt people is coming for our children\" and lots of people fall for that.  now that \"ellie\" feels that you are a bad influence, she may get paranoid, and an accusation of grooming can really destroy somebody\u00b4s life, no matter how infundated is the accusation, or if it\u00b4s done without any evidence, it can ruin your carreer and cost you big money to get your name cleared.  ypu probably should avoid having 1 on 1 talks with her, or being in the same room without her mom being there", "NTA, your gf didn't listen the whole story from the very beginning", "I'll give you some to cry about..\n\nWhat?

You were relating to and helping the niece navigate life.
