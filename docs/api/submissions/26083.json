It was most of the inheritance, but it is a Honda which I know will last at least 200k, because most do.\n  \nAnd I know by the time I need a new car, most if the student loan debt will be gone.

I outlined it there.", "Just read up the advice of any financial planner. Consumer Reports even recommends buying a gently used car instead of purchasing new. A vehicle, unlike real property, immediately depreciates in value before the ink is dry on the sale. Operating costs and insurance are higher for a new vehicle.

It is foolish to waste money on a car, when instead you could finance your retirement or use it towards a house (assuming a home is affordable otherwise) or guarantee that you have an emergency fund of 6months-1 year in the bank to cover things that come up, like medical bills, unemployment, or disability, or losing your belongings to a fire or natural disaster.", "All good!

Getting a newer car ensures that there are no issues and I'd something happens a warranty covers it. If nobody ever bought NEW cars there would be no gently used but good condition vehicles.

I bought my car new in 2015, it's now got 130k miles on it and I'll drive it until it dies. That's a smarter investment than trading it in on something else and continuing to have a car payment.

My husband and I bought a new Subaru WRX three years ago and the dealership keeps trying to buy it back for more than it's worth.

I'm not saying run out and use your inheritance to buy a fancy new car, but if you need a reliable car, it's not a bad idea. And you get much better warranty protection from a new car than from a used one, even a certified used one. A new car--as long as you do your research and don't go and buy a model that's just come out--is more reliable and less likely to break down or need expensive maintainance than a used car even only a few years old. A lot of people like the peace of mind of not having to worry about breaking down, especially if you've always had older cars. And every year safety features get better and percolate down to less expensive cars, like blind spot detection. The problem, though, is that people use an inheritance to buy a car they don't need, or a level of car they don't need but want. And while it might not make the best sense financially, sometimes it's not the end of the world to treat yourself, if it's not a huge deal otherwise. Like not paying bills, or not fixing something that really needs fixing (buying a fancy car instead of fixing the leaking roof, for example.) A lot of people don't often--or at all--get the chance to treat themselves in their lives.", "I'm a mechanic. I'd put money on a Honda that was purchased for $9,000 (so, likely less than 10 years old and probably under 100k miles unless it's a higher end model) being on the road still long after that Jeep is scrapped. Seriously... Jeeps are awful mechanically, and they keep getting worse. They certainly won't be needing a replacement in a few years. I'd take a 10 year old Honda over a brand new Jeep any day because I know which one would be more reliable. Jeeps are typically vehicles you sell as soon as the warranty is over. And I guarantee that OPs brother did fuck all for maintenance on it. I've seen THAT story many times over the years. Someone who was barely getting by comes into money, uses it to buy a brand new car, can't afford to take care of it, and is surprised when the engine seizes at 40,000 miles. And the rest of the car is usually trashed as well. Scratches and rust because they never wash it, interior worn out because they never clean it, so dust sands down every surface... Etc.\n\nAlso, it's always less expensive to fix an existing car then it is to buy a brand new one. The only reason to do so is because you either want modern features/ safety equipment, or you're beginning to worry that you're going to get stranded somewhere because your car is starting to need frequent repairs.", "Our Toyota FJ cruiser from 2007 (ish? It was my husband's, not mine) had people knocking on our door to buy the stupid thing. 130k miles, 15 years old, had a TON of external dings and damage, peeling paint... immediate 10k offer. If we'd repaired it (we didn't have the money) we could have gotten WAY more. Now, that was a really good \"used\" buy, but even if they'd bought it new it was worth it. We only replaced the alternator, and repaired damage to the axle housing in all that time. And the axle housing wasn't the car's fault either.  Meanwhile, the Honda Civic we bought new, with similar mileage currently, has... had the AC replaced. That's it. We'll have to get more done shortly I'm sure, because we're getting there, but I'm happy with what we've got so far with that too.\n\n\nThat's why I buy either new, or practically new. I don't want to pay to fix the stupid thing. If I get hit with repairs AND an emergency that drains my emergency funds I'm fubar. And what if something goes sideways and I can't afford to replace the car that's dying? I'd rather by a new and reliable car I can sell at about 150k miles, or run for over 200k with minimal work. If I have money, I sell at 150k miles. If not? I run that sucker into the ground. Sell it when the repairs are gonna get too costly.\n\nI hate buying and selling cars. And I hate borrowing money to buy a car, because interest. A car is a money sink, it's better to just get it out of the way so it's not an ongoing expense.", "Not the new shit, and certainly not a Grand Cherokee, which were considered shitty Jeeps even when Jeeps were still made to take a beating.
