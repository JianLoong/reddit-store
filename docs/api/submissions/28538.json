I mean the woman only lives like 10 minutes away, and she only sees her about once a month maybe once every two months. Like the only reason why I was talking to her was my husband said to give her another chance. But I mean she\u2019s one of those boomers that goes on TikTok and then makes tick-tock\u2019s about me about how I\u2019m a terrible person and I\u2019m a piece of shit child and I\u2019ve never shown her mothers respect ever since I was six apparently in her mind, I was living my own life at the age of six. Like my parents were together, but they were extremely toxic together. My parents would physically fight each other in front of me and my brother for years even though they did their best to take care of us it wasn\u2019t a good example of a loving family. There was no I love youse or hugs. You couldn\u2019t talk to your parent without them judging you or belittling you in someway. Like I\u2019ve always been by my mother side there since I was a kid but I\u2019m just so tired you know it doesn\u2019t matter how far of I have come.
