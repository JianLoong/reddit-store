{"id": 32023, "submission_id": "18777c9", "title": "AITA for telling my best friend that she can\u2019t care for her child?", "selftext": "I (31F) have been friends with my best friend Jill (26F) for a number of years now. She and I have been through a lot of ups and downs together, but have been solid in our friendship the entire time. Jill and her husband had a child 3 years ago and I love them to death. I would do anything possible for them. Jill has been very vocal in her desire for another baby, and is trying to conceive again. \n\nJill and her husband struggle financially. In a very big way. Every month, they are asking people for money to cover rent or their other bills, but then constantly order out or indulge in their habits when they have \u201cspare money.\u201d I have helped them several times as well, as I don\u2019t want to see them be evicted. \n\nAbout 6 months ago, I came into an inheritance when my great aunt passed away. It wasn\u2019t much, but enough for me to have a nice starter retirement fund and some money for an upcoming vacation for my husband and I. Jill asked me if I could help her, and I ended up giving her a somewhat large amount of money (more than just a couple hundred dollars, but nothing crazy) so she could keep caught up on bills for a couple months. However, she ended up spending it all and saving none of it. \n\nYesterday she called and asked if I could help her, as she needed groceries. I said I had already helped her immensely and declined to give her more money, but offered to buy her some groceries. Jill complained, saying that I should help her family because I was not struggling like she and her child are. I became angry and said \u201cand you want another one when you can\u2019t even care for the one you have now without handouts from everyone?\u201d Jill became upset, called me an asshole and hung up. She is now not speaking to me. \n\nMy husband is on my side, but I feel bad for blowing up at her. AITA?\n\nEdit for clarity: There have been a few questions in the comments about finances and stuff so I figured I would clear them up. \n1: my husband and I do share finances from our jobs, but the inheritance is mine only. \n2: I have offered to assist with her budgeting multiple times but she always tells me she doesn\u2019t need my help. I asked if she wanted the number to my financial advisor and that almost started a fight. \n3: My husband is definitely exhausted with her asking for money, which is why I haven\u2019t given her any in 6 months (since I gave her the larger sum). She has asked, I have said no, so this was not something I just said after one conversation. I blew up out of frustration, unfortunately.

However you are doing your friend a disservice. You think you\u2019re helping her but at this point you are enabling her. Stop all financial help. Tell her your inheritance has been spent or is non accessible due to it being in a retirement fund or whatever you need to say. If she asks for money tell her you can\u2019t afford it. If she says she has no food then look up local food banks or suggest food stamps. If everyone bails her out then nothing will ever change. \n\nThis is similar to a friend of my mothers. She always was short on bills and would ask for money each month to make her mortgage or car payment. Want to know what she always had money for? Eating out at very expensive restaurants, going to concerts, buying expensive name brand clothes and the newest iPhone every year. Her dad felt bad and didn\u2019t want his grandchildren to suffer so he always bailed her out. He spent almost his whole retirement on bailing her out and ended up having to work until he died in his 80\u2019s. She\u2019s a 50 year old woman still asking for handouts and hasn\u2019t learned a thing. Her children are now adults and out of the house so she has less bills and still no money because of her spending habits.", "NTA Her not speaking to you seems like a win since she's always asking for money when she does speak. \n\nWhile you were 100% correct, you can't say it if you want to keep her as a friend. Nobody likes another commenting on their parenting. If you're ready to cut them loose, walk away knowing you're right. If you want to preserve the friendship, you're probably going to have to apologize for overstepping. From now on, just stick with \"I can't do that right now\" when asked tor money. Do not elaborate and do not discuss it.", "NTA.  Says she wants money for groceries, but doesn't want you to buy groceries... yeah, she didn't want groceries.", "Truth hurts. Something is fishy when she wouldn't take actual groceries. There is no shame in being poor, but you still have to make reasonable decisions. NTA.", "NTA. She said she needed groceries and you offered to buy them for her. That should have been a good thing, but what she wanted was the cash. It becomes difficult when family or close friends don't want to help themselves and I fear that is where your friend is. If you want to keep the friendship you need to stop discussing anything financial. When Jill asks for money simply say you don't have any available cash right now.", "NTA\nBut stop being an ATM. Stop helping her.  Don't give hwr money,  don't pay her bills, don't buy hee groceries.  You are  enabling her wreckless spending.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s sad, but it\u2019s honest. \n\nAnother baby will most likely push them over the edge into true poverty. Their marriage and family won\u2019t be able to handle the strain and it will probably fall apart, sadly.", "That's probably why they are trying again, because you got an inheritance", "NTA\n\nThey definitely need to figure out a better strategy than what they have now. I don\u2019t think anything you say will really change that. The only thing you can do is stop enabling their bad habit (irresponsible with money). Hopefully they get smart about this, and come up with a better strategy. You are definitely not an ass for telling them the truth", "NTA you spoke the truth. She took advantage of your kindness and didn\u2019t save then had the gall to come and ask you for more money. When you declined additional funds, she initially gave you a hard time about it.", "NTA. I think you care for her so much that you\u2019re willing to help her but do you have a limit? Will you still be her friend if you stop helping her? I think it\u2019s time to rethink this friendship.", "NTA- you\u2019re absolutely correct. She\u2019s far too immature and irresponsible to have more children. You have to stop helping her because you\u2019re really just enabling her actions", "NTA.

It sounds like you are doing really well at this point in your life. Make sure you\u2019re also surrounding yourself with people who make you grow as a human and will lift you up.

I would make a bright red line (with your husband if you have joint finances) about your annual \u201cgifts to friends\u201d budget and be absolutely open about it when she asks for money: \u201cJill, I have $13 left of the $100 budget I have for friend gifts this year,\u201d for example. Let her know that this money is a gift\u2014no strings attached\u2014but it\u2019s also a gift like getting someone a present for their birthday: they can\u2019t ask for more. \n\nNot only does this let you and her have a clear idea of when the money runs out, but it models keeping a budget, something perhaps she could use help with. You could also drop a non-judgmental \u201cBoy I sure love personal finance stuff\u2014if you ever have questions about anything to do with savings or budgets, I\u2019m your gal,\u201d when you have a friendly conversation (NOT right after she\u2019s told you about a big expense) so that she knows that she can talk with you about developing these skills. \n\nYTA for yelling at her about something obviously very sensitive for her. If you feel bad, that just means your conscience works. Call her or send a text with a proper apology. Don\u2019t say you were stressed because of the money request or anything, just say, \u201cwe\u2019re friends, I care for you and I hurt you.

She is no helpless child, but an adult who can't manage her finances and only relies on other people's help. Those who help her are really only enabling her, and it was about time someone put a stop to it.\n\nYou might end up losing that \"friendship\", but is this entitled, whining person who is using you and others as an ATM worth being friends with?

Is she supportive of you or is she only ready to pounce on you once she knows you have come by some extra money?\n\nYou blew up at her out of a reasonable exasperation.

As others have mentioned, NO is a complete sentence. You can't erase the past, but giving her a chunk of money (thousands? Hundreds?) was the worst thing to do, because she obviously thinks that is now a regular thing to ask you for. And sees you as her personal bank. And asking for groceries but turning down actual groceries? If you can't see through this obvious cash grab attempt, I don't know what to tell you.\n\nIf she asks again, be ready with websites or phone numbers for food banks, social services, food stamps, etc. I would never give her a penny again if I were you. Cut that support off cold turkey. Honestly,  let them get evicted.
