She and I have been through a lot of ups and downs together, but have been solid in our friendship the entire time. Jill and her husband had a child 3 years ago and I love them to death. I would do anything possible for them. Jill has been very vocal in her desire for another baby, and is trying to conceive again. \n\nJill and her husband struggle financially. In a very big way. Every month, they are asking people for money to cover rent or their other bills, but then constantly order out or indulge in their habits when they have \u201cspare money.\u201d I have helped them several times as well, as I don\u2019t want to see them be evicted. \n\nAbout 6 months ago, I came into an inheritance when my great aunt passed away. It wasn\u2019t much, but enough for me to have a nice starter retirement fund and some money for an upcoming vacation for my husband and I. Jill asked me if I could help her, and I ended up giving her a somewhat large amount of money (more than just a couple hundred dollars, but nothing crazy) so she could keep caught up on bills for a couple months. However, she ended up spending it all and saving none of it. \n\nYesterday she called and asked if I could help her, as she needed groceries. I said I had already helped her immensely and declined to give her more money, but offered to buy her some groceries. Jill complained, saying that I should help her family because I was not struggling like she and her child are. I became angry and said \u201cand you want another one when you can\u2019t even care for the one you have now without handouts from everyone?\u201d Jill became upset, called me an asshole and hung up. She is now not speaking to me. \n\nMy husband is on my side, but I feel bad for blowing up at her. AITA?\n\nEdit for clarity: There have been a few questions in the comments about finances and stuff so I figured I would clear them up. \n1: my husband and I do share finances from our jobs, but the inheritance is mine only. \n2: I have offered to assist with her budgeting multiple times but she always tells me she doesn\u2019t need my help. I asked if she wanted the number to my financial advisor and that almost started a fight. \n3: My husband is definitely exhausted with her asking for money, which is why I haven\u2019t given her any in 6 months (since I gave her the larger sum). She has asked, I have said no, so this was not something I just said after one conversation. I blew up out of frustration, unfortunately.\n4: the \u201chabits,\u201d I mentioned are cigarettes (she is a heavy smoker) and weed. \n\nUpdate: She called me this afternoon while I was at work (my husband and I both work from home so he was within ear shot of the conversation as well) and said she was sorry for calling me an asshole, but I was being \u201cincredibly insensitive,\u201d towards her situation. I, calmly, explained that I would no longer be giving her money, purchasing her groceries, or assisting with bills, as I am not going to be financially responsible for her, her habits, or her child. She became upset, saying that because I don\u2019t have children (I am child free by choice), I don\u2019t understand how difficult this is. I explained that her life choices are not my problem and my decision is firm. She was obviously unhappy. I don\u2019t know where our friendship will go, but it\u2019s now clear she will be receiving nothing from me moving forward.

However you are doing your friend a disservice. You think you\u2019re helping her but at this point you are enabling her. Stop all financial help. Tell her your inheritance has been spent or is non accessible due to it being in a retirement fund or whatever you need to say. If she asks for money tell her you can\u2019t afford it. If she says she has no food then look up local food banks or suggest food stamps. If everyone bails her out then nothing will ever change. \n\nThis is similar to a friend of my mothers. She always was short on bills and would ask for money each month to make her mortgage or car payment. Want to know what she always had money for? Eating out at very expensive restaurants, going to concerts, buying expensive name brand clothes and the newest iPhone every year. Her dad felt bad and didn\u2019t want his grandchildren to suffer so he always bailed her out. He spent almost his whole retirement on bailing her out and ended up having to work until he died in his 80\u2019s.

Nobody likes another commenting on their parenting. If you're ready to cut them loose, walk away knowing you're right. If you want to preserve the friendship, you're probably going to have to apologize for overstepping. From now on, just stick with \"I can't do that right now\" when asked tor money.

She said she needed groceries and you offered to buy them for her. That should have been a good thing, but what she wanted was the cash.

You are  enabling her wreckless spending.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s sad, but it\u2019s honest. \n\nAnother baby will most likely push them over the edge into true poverty.

Then when she was still short we would go to grocery store with her and cover whatever she was short plus pay for diapers. \n\nShe was grateful for the help and we knew the money we were spending was actually helping them out. By giving your friend money you're enabling lifestyle she can't maintain. At some point in time, your friend needs to figure it out and stop pretending she's not an adult.", "IMO:\n\n1. Do not give her more money unless they are literally out of food and about to go hungry.\n2. They are obviously extremely irresponsble with money, and REALLY need to learn to get a handle on it.\n3. That said, when you struggle financially for a LONG period of time it can be REALLY tough to remain firm on spending money wisely. Small indulgences like a pizza now and then, or a night out at the movies helps to humanize people and make all the struggle feel more bearable. Never feeling \"allowed\"  few simple pleasures can lead to the kind of depression that in the long run can be an even bigger financial set back.\n4. There's all kinds of factors that could be genuinely out of their control causing the issues of why they struggle with money. I'm recently diagnosed with ADHD after struggling undiagnosed all my life, and let me tell you being undiagnosed and unmedicated for SURE played a big part in financial struggle. ADHD makes you impulsive, short sighted, forgetful, etc and all of those will cost you a lot of money. Also if they grew up poor they may just genuinely not know any other way to live. Growing up poor literally changes your brain, and it takes a lot of effort and/or help from the outside to undo that.\n5. You've been a good friend to try to help them so much. Both financially, and by trying to get them to seek financial help from an advisor. I'm sure you are sympathetic to why they might react to that negatively though. It's uncomfortable to be reminded of your inability to take care of yourself and your family. To you it might seem simple. They need help and you've made useful suggestions, and it's rather black and white. It might be easier to be gentle with the suggestions, ease them into accepting they need outsside help, and ease them into accepting it. tell them you can't keep giving them money, that it isn't any kind of long term help for them, but that you'd like to help them GET the long term help they need. Tell them you don't judge them for needing the help (and it's ok if deep down you DO judge them a little for it, because it's genuinely tough to understand the factors that may be at play in their life that lead them to this, and without that knowledge it's natural to make a value judgement about it.)\n6. I don't think they need a financial advisor. They can not plan their way out of poor if they need possibly a mental disorder diagnosis, or life skills help, or an education that leads to better jobs and pay. These are likely the areas of help they likely need. In the short term, they may need help being directed to getting government help like food assistence, rent or utility assistence,etc. Some people are ignorant there is help out there, or they are weird about accepting that help, but that is what it is there for and they shouldn't feel weird about using it if they need it. It also shouldn't be a long term plan, but used to relieve the pressure and give them the mental energy to start getting the help they need.", "NTA, I mean, if she didn't asked you for any money you wouldn't be put in a situation where you need to say no...\nMoney can lead to fights even in relationships or families, so why is she asking friends for some knowing it can lead to this?", "NTA\nShe wants money for groceries but when you offer her to buy her groceries she gets mad?

Period.", "OP - If you give money to your friend frequently and she tells you she doesn't need your help then she is using you for her own gain. One question comes to mind here, what are you referring to when you say, \"indulge in their other habits\"? This sounds like my bf's daughter, had a boyfriend who is deadbeat and lived off of her SSI income. The rent they paid was only around 100.00/month because it was low income based. The funny part was they were always asking for money continuously from all the family members and yet could afford to do drugs but never pay rent or maintain the vehicle. It all finally came to a head when I learned that we were all being manipulated and lied too separately. I sat down with my bf, and we had a discussion about what was really happening and decided enough was enough. Well, here's what happened. She called her father every nasty name you can think of, told him he didn't have a daughter anymore and has not spoken to either of us for over a year now. Afterall her father had done for her for all those years, she posted nasty stuff on F.B about him, it broke his heart even though he was angry at the same time. The thing is, when a couple decide to have children or go on their own, it is expected of them to be responsible adults who budget their money wisely, so they do not have to rely on others. Your friend has been using you for a long time, and she can't be trusted with the money that others are giving her. she is not your responsibility and each time she is given money, she expects it and does not have to face the consequences of her poor choices. Your friend is obviously extremely immature and should not be considering having another child, because she can't take care of the one she has now, not to mention the selfishness of thinking others need to support her, her husband and her children.
