However you are doing your friend a disservice. You think you\u2019re helping her but at this point you are enabling her. Stop all financial help. Tell her your inheritance has been spent or is non accessible due to it being in a retirement fund or whatever you need to say. If she asks for money tell her you can\u2019t afford it. If she says she has no food then look up local food banks or suggest food stamps. If everyone bails her out then nothing will ever change. \n\nThis is similar to a friend of my mothers. She always was short on bills and would ask for money each month to make her mortgage or car payment. Want to know what she always had money for? Eating out at very expensive restaurants, going to concerts, buying expensive name brand clothes and the newest iPhone every year. Her dad felt bad and didn\u2019t want his grandchildren to suffer so he always bailed her out. He spent almost his whole retirement on bailing her out and ended up having to work until he died in his 80\u2019s. She\u2019s a 50 year old woman still asking for handouts and hasn\u2019t learned a thing. Her children are now adults and out of the house so she has less bills and still no money because of her spending habits.", "NTA Her not speaking to you seems like a win since she's always asking for money when she does speak. \n\nWhile you were 100% correct, you can't say it if you want to keep her as a friend. Nobody likes another commenting on their parenting. If you're ready to cut them loose, walk away knowing you're right. If you want to preserve the friendship, you're probably going to have to apologize for overstepping. From now on, just stick with \"I can't do that right now\" when asked tor money. Do not elaborate and do not discuss it.", "NTA.  Says she wants money for groceries, but doesn't want you to buy groceries... yeah, she didn't want groceries.", "Truth hurts. Something is fishy when she wouldn't take actual groceries. There is no shame in being poor, but you still have to make reasonable decisions. NTA.", "NTA. She said she needed groceries and you offered to buy them for her. That should have been a good thing, but what she wanted was the cash. It becomes difficult when family or close friends don't want to help themselves and I fear that is where your friend is. If you want to keep the friendship you need to stop discussing anything financial. When Jill asks for money simply say you don't have any available cash right now.", "NTA\nBut stop being an ATM. Stop helping her.  Don't give hwr money,  don't pay her bills, don't buy hee groceries.  You are  enabling her wreckless spending.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s sad, but it\u2019s honest. \n\nAnother baby will most likely push them over the edge into true poverty. Their marriage and family won\u2019t be able to handle the strain and it will probably fall apart, sadly.", "That's probably why they are trying again, because you got an inheritance", "NTA\n\nThey definitely need to figure out a better strategy than what they have now. I don\u2019t think anything you say will really change that. The only thing you can do is stop enabling their bad habit (irresponsible with money). Hopefully they get smart about this, and come up with a better strategy. You are definitely not an ass for telling them the truth", "NTA you spoke the truth. She took advantage of your kindness and didn\u2019t save then had the gall to come and ask you for more money. When you declined additional funds, she initially gave you a hard time about it.", "NTA. I think you care for her so much that you\u2019re willing to help her but do you have a limit? Will you still be her friend if you stop helping her? I think it\u2019s time to rethink this friendship.", "NTA- you\u2019re absolutely correct. She\u2019s far too immature and irresponsible to have more children. You have to stop helping her because you\u2019re really just enabling her actions", "NTA.  Cut off all the money and she will clearly communicate the value she places on your friendship.", "I don't think you are her friend. Sounds more like you are her atm.", "Nta. You\u2019re not an AH, you\u2019re a dose of reality.l she doesn\u2019t want to take. A spoonful of sugar might have helped, but you\u2019re not an AH for not giving it.\n\nIf you want to help her, I\u2019d make her next gift a session with a financial advisor.", "NTA you could have expressed the concept in a nicer way, but bottom line truth hurts.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They need to learn to stand on their own two feet, especially before having another child. Stop giving them money.", "NTA. She is using you. She needs to gain some financial literacy asap and also take responsibility for her own actions and decisions, including the decision to have another baby. It sounds like you are doing really well at this point in your life. Make sure you\u2019re also surrounding yourself with people who make you grow as a human and will lift you up. Consider that this friendship may have run its course. You can stay cordial but you might want to start protecting yourself and creating healthy boundaries.", "Nta. Never feel guilty about not helping people who aren\u2019t willing to help themselves.", "NTA. I smell a mooch!!", "Absolutely **N. T. A.**\n\nHopefully, she\u2019ll get her wake-up call.", "NTA - maybe consider getting some financial boundaries bc as it stands it seems like you are enabling her", "NTA. At all. But no more giving her money.", "NTA Is this you Kim? \ud83d\ude02 I have a friend like you. Always letting some BS \u201cfriend\u201d have money. Cut her off.

There is a difference.", "NOPE NTA she needs to take care of the kid she has and grow up", "I\u2019m getting substance abuse vibes from the friend\u2026", "NTA for not helping out with finances\n\nMoney is tricky with friends. I would make a bright red line (with your husband if you have joint finances) about your annual \u201cgifts to friends\u201d budget and be absolutely open about it when she asks for money: \u201cJill, I have $13 left of the $100 budget I have for friend gifts this year,\u201d for example. Let her know that this money is a gift\u2014no strings attached\u2014but it\u2019s also a gift like getting someone a present for their birthday: they can\u2019t ask for more. \n\nNot only does this let you and her have a clear idea of when the money runs out, but it models keeping a budget, something perhaps she could use help with. You could also drop a non-judgmental \u201cBoy I sure love personal finance stuff\u2014if you ever have questions about anything to do with savings or budgets, I\u2019m your gal,\u201d when you have a friendly conversation (NOT right after she\u2019s told you about a big expense) so that she knows that she can talk with you about developing these skills. \n\nYTA for yelling at her about something obviously very sensitive for her. If you feel bad, that just means your conscience works. Call her or send a text with a proper apology. Don\u2019t say you were stressed because of the money request or anything, just say, \u201cwe\u2019re friends, I care for you and I hurt you. I said something inappropriate that I shouldn\u2019t have said.\u201d Don\u2019t offer her money in your apology.", "NTA. Its seems like your friend is an incompetent mooch and you're enabling her. Stay firm on your decision, you didn't do or say anything wrong. You're not in any way responsible for her livelihood.", "NTA\n\nSometimes it is hard to help. But sehr needs to getbup in her own feets. And you are right. If she can't care for her first child, she should overthink what she is going to do, to make more Money or to safe it.\n\nI've been struggling by myself with Money sometimes. But made it always by myself.\n\nMaybe you are loosing a \"friend\". But If it's so, you have never been one, Just her bankcard.\n\nIn Germany we say: with money stops the friendship (what actually means, you can bei friends, but never loan from your friends, the friendship will probably be over).\n\nI offered Friends, even If I'm short, money, but they never took it, because it is very often the start to have problems.\ud83e\udd37\n\nYou made it right. Be honest to her, but let her help herself!", "NTA.\n\nYou know how to tell the difference between a moocher and someone genuinely needing help? The one in genuine need happily accepts whatever you are able/willing to give.\n\nI was homeless for a while.

Unfortunately she has taken advantage of your kindness, for far too long, and you've been enabling her in asking for money from everyone.

This is good advice though. *When* Jill contacts you again (and asks for money) just remember that no is a complete sentence.", "I have a feeling this'' friendship'' will end when money is no longer part of the equation. The lady contacts op only because she gets something out of it.", "It\u2019s addict speak for sure. \u201cGroceries\u201d \n\nCould be drugs or gambling or just shopping or something but either way they\u2019re hiding a maladaptive behavior.", "Exactly why whenever a friend of mine needs some help I don't give them cash. What bill do you need paid, what's the account number and call the company and pay the bill. Pay the rent, electric. Take them to the store to buy groceries. Never give cash. If they really do need the help they will gladly accept that form of \"payment\". If all they want is cash, they are just looking for handouts to pay for whatever luxury they think they need.", "That's my thinking, too. The trash just took itself out.", "I do give cash sometimes, but I don't have any friends/family who need help regularly.\n\nAlmost all of them will insist on paying me back even if I told them when I gave them the money that they really, truly didn't have to and they should consider it a gift.\n\nA certain brother-in-law did that to me and I had to buy him a car over it, because this was the same guy who, after I'd been in a serious accident, helped out a *lot* in terms of time and care *and* money and refused all repayment, and like... my brother in Christ you will NOT tell me charity only goes one way in this relationship.\n\nAt one time, he had plenty, and I was in need, and he gave freely. A few years later he fell on hard times and I had money, and he was going to receive what I gave him freely if I had to buy an Audi about it.\n\nI did let him take over paying for registration and maintenance when he could afford it again."]}
