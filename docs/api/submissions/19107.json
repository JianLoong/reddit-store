You can\u2019t predict gender, you know its either going to be a boy or a girl, you have no say over which it is. Why be disappointed? If you decide to have a baby then care for that baby no matter what. Its terrible to think any child would be \u201cdisappointing\u201d their parents even before they were born, this is terrible narcissistic parenting. Parents should love their children unconditionally and not care about what gender they are. Its a privilege to be a parent. That human life depends on you.

Parenting is a walk in the dark on a path you cannot map out in advance, even if you've been around other parents, even if you're a parent already, because every child is different. He wasn't even ready for a girl, which is basically the first potential fork in the road (potential,  I know gender is more complicated than that, I'm simplifying).", "Lord especially when they don't know the difference between feelings and behavior.", "Agree", "YTA you better get your nonsense in check quickly.

Your poor daughter is going to grow up knowing you didn't want her. YTA OP", "That was my first thought after he said his family was all shocked as well that it wasn't a boy.

For a lot of people it feels like their baby died and they got a new one. While obviously this isn't true, I'm sure it's a huge shock during a time when alot of emotions are flying about anyway.\n\nI don't think gender disappointment is really a thing before you officially find out the gender though.
