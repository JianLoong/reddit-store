You're going to be a parent, you need to grow up fast and stop throwing yourself a pity party.\n\nAlso, get some real scientific education about how biological sex is determined: it's entirely due to your sperm. So you don't come from a 'boy family'. You just happen to have only had biological males for a small amount of time.\n\nNot to mention that the ridiculous stereotypes that we've enforced on gender are breaking down. Your child's biological sex will likely have no bearing upon their personality except what YOU force onto them.

Of course YTA!\n\nThere was nothing wrong with you having a preference or an expectation (though seriously, you have some pretty flawed logic there - if you're looking at statistics, your family was well overdue for a girl), but to react so immaturely speaks poorly of you.\n\nHopefully you grow the f up before your daughter is born so you can be a decent father.

That fact should have registered with your wife, and yourself, to give you the opportunity to mentally prepare.\n\nWhoever knew the gender before the party is TA, because they should have told you ahead of time, in order to give you the opportunity to prepare for your big moment.\n\nNobody needed you to be shocked, everyone needed you to be happy.", "So shocking, a man who hates women.

That couple now regrets starting the trend because (1) the child they had the gender reveal for ended up being transgender and (2) people started taking it too far and causing environmental disasters."]}
