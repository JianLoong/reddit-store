At the time I HATED it, he had a son that was pretty much the exact same age as me.  We fought ALOT when they first moved in, Id go as far and say that I genuinely despised him.  Our parents really had their hands full with us lol   \n\n\nWhen we were both 7 our parents told us they were pregnant with our half brother. This was when I still hated my step brother and the new marriage still kinda pissed me off so I wasn\u2019t too thrilled about another kid being added. When he was born is when I really hit my angst-y side and I remember my older cousin (12 at the time) recording me going on a rant about how much I hate both my brothers and how I wanted both gone and some other not nice things said about both.  2 years later my mom gave birth to my half sister, I was starting to come around to the new family a bit more so wasn't as pissed with her.    \n\n\nMain story: My half brother and sister are now 9 and 7, they're both pretty loud kids and while I dont mind it my stepbrother HATES it.  The other day they got into it again and IDK how he found it but he found my old DSI that had the rant on it and showed our younger brother the entire vid.  I was on the couch while they were in the hallway and I could see him look upset before practically pushing the older one out of the way and went to his room.   \nThe older one wouldn\u2019t stop laughing and told me the vid he showed him. I was pretty miffed at this and said something along the lines of \"The fuck is wrong with you?  Hes a fucking child you prick\"  He told me something like \"Well im not the one who fucking made the vid huh?\" I flipped him off before going to my room before I said anything else.   \n\n\nI\u2019ve already apologized to the younger one and I think he understands but I haven\u2019t said a word to the older one going on 3 days now, hes tried to talk to me but I refuse to say a word to him. My mom is now saying I\u2019m being immature since the younger one already forgave me and my stepbrother but nope im not breaking soon.    \n\n\nBut im curious AITA?

He did it to cause trouble.

What has he tried to say to you? Has he apologised to your half-brother (for being purposely hurtful) and you (for using that old video of you to do it - and risking your relationship to your half-brother in the process)?", "NTA\n\nHopefully your stepbrother will show some genuine remorse at some point.", "NTA. He should apologize not just to you but to your little brother. Mom just saying let it go to keep the peace is always such a crappy parenting move", "NAH in my opinion. What your step brother did was fucked,not just to you, but your half brother as well. What possible reason did your step brother have dragging something you said years ago,and likely don't mean anymore out of the closet? To hurt your half brother? To hurt you? Nah. you're good,OP.", "YTA. Freezing someone out for a youthful mistake is cruel and immature.

Your vent was valid and it was very situational.   You seem to have grown up and don't think the same about your half siblings as you might've a few years ago.\n\nDid your relationship with your step brother improve or has there continued to be animosity?  If that's the case, it was probably calculated and he's TA in this situation.\n\nYou've already apologised to your younger brother.  That's the person that really matters in this situation.  Foster that relationship.  This is blip and shouldn't impact anything.  \n\nAs for the step brother.  He's either hoping you forget what he did.  He either doesn't want to acknowledge what he did was wrong and hopes you'll forget it... or he really doesn't care and wants life to go on the way it was.\n\nYou have to live with him.  You probably can't trust him.  Maybe keep him at arms length as an acquaintance and don't tell him anything personal about your life.  You'll either repair your relationship or nothing will change and you'll just be respectful towards each other because you have to.", "NTA.\n\nYour stepbrother intentionally hurt your little brother\u2019s feelings. He sounds like a real loser.\n\nYour little brother will *probably* find the video of you ranting as a little kid funny when he\u2019s older (depending on what you said), but he\u2019s too young to have that perspective now.\n\nBut, you can\u2019t give your stepbrother the silent treatment forever. You don\u2019t have to like each other, but for the sake of everyone else, you should at least be civil.\n\nThere are bigger issues between you two that need to be dealt with.

Not close but we didnt really fight like ever, hell rn is probably our first real fight since we were both in middle school", "In that case my verdict is NTA - what he did was hurtful so it's fair to be pissed at what he did if he hasn't tried to say sorry at all. If you want to fix things, you could consider reaching out and explaining to him that it was hurtful to see if it prompts remorse or an apology, but you don't owe him or anything.", "NTA, and ffs, destroy the video before it comes back around second time.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbut the real AHs are your parents.", "NTA. Your stepbrother is a jerk. No need to waste your breath talking to someone like that. He'll get over it just like your poor half brother did.", "NTA \n\nI hope you explained that the younger brother that you were very emotional etc in that video and that you like him very much. Because that must have been hard to watch for him. \n\nYour stepbrother however is a total ah. He knew what he was doing, he just wanted to have you guys fight. It's his fault if the younger brother is hurt - not yours. \n\nAnd how nice that your mom thinks you should forgive stepbrother just because the younger one is fine again. That's not how it works. Did stepbrother even get any scolding from the parents???", "*youthful **choice**"]}
