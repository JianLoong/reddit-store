We have our niece over sometimes to let our kids spend time together so we really didn't mind.\n\nMy wife and I both adore Hailey, and we thought we'd make this trip extra special for her.

Sheesh! NTA", "NTA.  Can you have ME over for a few days :)", "You are a wonderful support system for you niece! NTA", "NTA If she doesn\u2019t trust you to keep her child safe while out she shouldn\u2019t of left her with you. Also she shouldn\u2019t expect you to stop living your lives because you have her child. You guys did her a favor and she sounds super ungrateful.", "NTA. She asked you to have her for a few days while her dad was in the hospital. For you to be giving her your itinerary every 30 minutes seems like it would be the AH thing to do. \n\nYou gave your niece a fun time and her parents didn\u2019t have to worry about her. Maybe she is just upset and misplacing her anger?", "NTA it sounds as if the mother is upset about a change in expectations after a mini-vacation with Fun Aunts.", "NTA. Did she expect you to do nothing and have no fun? Was she expecting her daughter to sit in quiet meditation thinking and praying for her father? If you ever get another chance with this kid, go for broke and show her the thrill of a lifetime.", "Personally I\u2019m going to say NTA, you were asked to step in and helped keep her distracted while her dad was in the hospital", "NTA.  Your SIL is overreacting because she is upset about her husband\u2019s medical crisis, so maybe give her grace for her irrationality on this issue.  If she trusted you to take full custody of her child for several days I\u2019m sure at some point in the past she would have explained any specific rules/requests she may have about caring for her daughter.  It is unreasonable to expect you to specifically seek permission for each location/outing.  Even summer camps only give you a general idea of the daily structure and there is an understanding that field trips will occur within a specific mile radius.  Unless in the past she specifically told you both to not take your niece places then you are perfectly fine here.  She should be thanking you for the help, not picking fights.", "INFO: Was her husband hospitalized due to an accident?  NTA either way, but your SIL may also be NTA, just stressed and overprotective right now.", "NTA. I would love to have a SIL like you!", "NTA - She sounds ungrateful, a control freak, and/or majorly stressed out from her husband's hospitalization. Most parents would be thrilled you cared enough to engage the cousins in fun outings at your expense. What exactly did you do wrong?", "NTA. I kinda get your SIL, specially if she is a helicopter parent, but making a big fuss about it seems she is actually the AH.\n\nI mean, you didn't take the kid out hunting, to a bullfighting ring or a boxing match, right? (The kind of activities I would be mad as a parent)", "NTA", "NTA most of these I'd be stoked if my kid came back and told me they'd done. Only one I can potentially see being an issue is the pool. Unless you know the child's swimming ability well then it can be a bit dangerous. This is coming from someone who had to be rescued at the pools because my swimming ability was absolutely zero, but that wasn't communicated very well to the other family well.", "NTA.   Did she expect you to drop any plans and stay home all day?   I'm assuming you had cellphones on you and returned to your home every evening, so you were reachable, and you didn't travel far enough away that you couldn't get her to your sister if needed..    Unless your niece has special needs that may make places unsafe for her, if she was with your family and properly supervised, nothing you did was unreasonable when you were asked to take her for multiple days.", "NTA. Your SIL was under a lot of stress that affected her judgment. Give her your understanding and let it go.", "INFO: Does she have a problem with any of the places you took her or does she simply not like not knowing where her child is? Because the latter is somewhat understandable IMO", "A soft NTA. you really should let people know where their kids are, especially when it's something like swimming or visiting a place full of strangers like an amusement park.  You're not the assholes because she should be checking in enough for the kid to tell her these things.  I know it's tough when someone is sick, but she still has a kid.  If she's super concerned about the kids whereabouts then she should get an air tag or smart watch for her.", "\u201cI dumped my child on you for days.  What on earth gave you the impression I wanted you to do things with them?\u201d  NTA lol", "Considering her husband is hospitalized I would expect you to let your SIL know about Hailey going out with your family as a matter of risk assessment\n\nNAH", "I don't if you're a hard YTA, but what you did was kinda shitty.  While I understand you wanted to make your niece's time with you special, not informing her mom that you were going out was a crap move.  You could have shot her a text.  So why didn't you?\n\nWhile I (a 17yo minor) was out with a friend and her mom heading to watch a movie, we got into a minor car accident.  Minor because while the side of the car was dented it was still drivable and there were no injuries.  We collectively made the decision to proceeded with our plans to the movies without informing my parents.  That was a huge mistake, when my parents found out they were livid not just at me (because I knew better), but also with the \"RESPONSIBLE ADULT\" who didn't think it was a big deal since nobody was hurt.   But it was a big deal, to my parents.  She was there with her daughter and so knew the severity of the accident, MY PARENTS were not and I, their daughter, was in the accident (minor or not).\n\nThis isn't about you taking your niece to these wonderful places, it's about you not being considerate to \"her parent.\"  I didn't have a cellphone, but I'm guessing you do, there is no excuse to not shoot a text saying where you were going and when, but you didn't and it was an irresponsible move.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
