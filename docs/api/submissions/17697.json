Your SIL is overreacting because she is upset about her husband\u2019s medical crisis, so maybe give her grace for her irrationality on this issue.  If she trusted you to take full custody of her child for several days I\u2019m sure at some point in the past she would have explained any specific rules/requests she may have about caring for her daughter.  It is unreasonable to expect you to specifically seek permission for each location/outing.  Even summer camps only give you a general idea of the daily structure and there is an understanding that field trips will occur within a specific mile radius.

You're not the assholes because she should be checking in enough for the kid to tell her these things.  I know it's tough when someone is sick, but she still has a kid.  If she's super concerned about the kids whereabouts then she should get an air tag or smart watch for her.", "\u201cI dumped my child on you for days.

So why didn't you?\n\nWhile I (a 17yo minor) was out with a friend and her mom heading to watch a movie, we got into a minor car accident.  Minor because while the side of the car was dented it was still drivable and there were no injuries.  We collectively made the decision to proceeded with our plans to the movies without informing my parents.  That was a huge mistake, when my parents found out they were livid not just at me (because I knew better), but also with the \"RESPONSIBLE ADULT\" who didn't think it was a big deal since nobody was hurt.   But it was a big deal, to my parents.  She was there with her daughter and so knew the severity of the accident, MY PARENTS were not and I, their daughter, was in the accident (minor or not).\n\nThis isn't about you taking your niece to these wonderful places, it's about you not being considerate to \"her parent.\"  I didn't have a cellphone, but I'm guessing you do, there is no excuse to not shoot a text saying where you were going and when, but you didn't and it was an irresponsible move.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It reminds me of an EX friend who visited and tried to shame me for having 5 dog beds in the house.   Well I had a 15 year old Golden Retriever with chronic pain and separaqtion anxiety so there was a foam doggie bed in every room that we spend time in.    My ex mean friend mocked me for having so many dog beds.

You\u2019ve done your niece a favour.\n\nTo be fair to your SiL, she was probably just extra anxious after her husbands accident but it also has a ring of she doesn\u2019t trust you with her kid.

You know why?? Because now if something HAD happened, she wouldn\u2019t be confused as to why you guys ended up at a Zoo and not at your home where she just assumed her child to be.

Not that this makes it okay at all, but you don\u2019t need to worry you did anything wrong. She\u2019s going to feel really embarrassed once things settle down.

If no one shows up for pick up or drop off you at least know where they were supposed to be to tell the police.", "Except the destinations mentioned are ones in which it\u2019s pretty notorious for people to miss calls - movies, pool, amusement park.", "I refuse to believe it's they're real. If it is, they might need some help to work on their anxieties.", "But SIL didn\u2019t say that lol she\u2019s mad that OP didn\u2019t follow instructions that she didn\u2019t even give", "So your fam wouldn\u2019t want pics of their kids having fun lol", "Why would leave your kid with somebody that doesn\u2019t know who they are", "Dude, for what it's worth I'm in the Netherlands but in my eyes your way of thinking sounds exhausting. What OP described they did as activities sounds fun and perfectly safe. They didn't go DIY bungee jumping. It's a nice way to take the kid's mind off of worrying about her dad while she was away from home. It's not healthy for little ones to be helicopter-parented and warned they might die or end up in the hospital every time they go out to ride bikes/rollerblade/go skateboarding etc.", "Howdy neighbor! I totally agree with you on that and since OP did not mention it anywhere that mom knew what her kid was up to. Like if I get my sisters kids for a weekend getaway (nothing to worry)about I would still send them pictures of how lovely their kids are. Or an anekdote of what stupid thing they said. \n\nAnd maybe it\u2019s just my experience, when I was in the hospital with the youngest my husband /sister/mother/ his mother they all kept me updated on my other kid. (I could only spare a few moments then with the eldest because the youngest went I. The hospital for over a week but was still breast feeding) the fact I did not need to ask how fine the other one was doing that they just let me know is soothing. \nQ\nKnowing I had to worry more when I was already worried sick is bad. \n\nI trust all people I leave my kids with. (What parent would leave if they didn\u2019t trust people)\nI\u2019m not the mom who writes down a list off rules for you to take care of my kids. \nThere are just 2. 1. Enjoy your time with my kids. 2. Return them in one piece. \n\nWhat I get back is Pictures of my kids doing an sack race in grandma\u2019s pillow cases. Trips to the zoo. Swimming in the pool. On top of the climbing tower. \n\nI don\u2019t mind them doing it, but radio silence is just what weirded me out here especially if it\u2019s for more than one day. And do I think you should not pin it on the worried mother but the sitter that responsibility of no radio silence, yeah, I think I can do that.", "Well apparently I\u2019m the asshole to think you could let parents know what you do with their kids\u2026", "You\u2019re not an asshole, just more fun than her actual parents NTA", "Nta.  U don't need her permission for her daughter to have fun", "NTA. They asked YOU to look after their kid.  \nNext time, DON'T.", "NTA. SIL did not communicate her expectations.", "NTA. I really see nothing wrong with what you did. SIL should be glad that you entertained your niece so well.", "NTA, absolutely. She\u2019s totally out of line. But it feels like a strangely strong reaction from someone who is directing anger and fear in the wrong direction? I\u2019m unsure of the history. For the sake of your very important relationship with your niece (and for her sake in general) I would either let this blow over or find a way to soften the tension. In time, hopefully she realises she was out of line.", "NTA but honestly, i\u2019d give her the benefit of the doubt right now for a few days at least. sounds like she\u2019s probably super stressed and maybe even a bit jealous her daughter had so much fun with you guys while she\u2019s been stuck in a hospital room and maybe worried about money/being able to provide those fun things for her kid now too. it\u2019s not acceptable behaviour but i\u2019d give her a bit of time to cool off and then see if she apologises", "NTA if she didn't trust you why'd she leave the kid with you?", "NTA. Like what?  Isn\u2019t that kind of standard, you have a guest from out of town and you go out and do stuff?  Like yeah she\u2019s 7, but you didn\u2019t take her axe throwing or bungee jumping, you went on kid friendly outings, which she probably enjoyed as she may be stressed out from her mom being stressed about her partner.", "NTA just tell her all she has to say is thank you", "NTA. Your SIL is unhinged.", "NTA", "Right! My mum was in hospital and we had to go to my uncles overnight we got take out and a blockbuster movie, and went to the park opposite his house the next day. Going to the zoo, etc. It sounds like an awesome few days and a great way to take their mind off worrying about dad. \n\n\nNTA but you are AAAs amazingly awesome aunties !!!!", "Yeah, I can agree this is the only iffy one listed as I know some parents never want their child in the water without them there. But a simple, \u201cHey I appreciate you watching her and take her to do fun things, but please don\u2019t take her to the pool\u201d would have sufficed. IF that were the reason for being upset. I\u2019m just theorizing.", "Oh man, the horror of a kid going to the pool/amusement park/movies etc.", "You think perhaps she was trying to keep her nieces mind from worrying about her dad? OP specifically stated she didn\u2019t want to worry or bother her while she was looking after her husband. If it was SO IMPORTANT to know everything they did, why didn\u2019t she contact them herself and ask daily? I hope you attempt to hide your absolutely bonkers catastrophising from your kids, what a nightmare.", "I'm amazed you ever make it outside your home if you're this paranoid about such inane activities", "Exactly!", "Not to mention that OP and her wife have a kid too, who presumably came on these outings? If it's safe enough for their kid it's safe enough for Hailey!", "I love that I\u2019m paranoid. \n\nBut this is the google answer to how many abductions are there in the US.\n\nEvery 40 seconds, a child goes missing or is abducted in the United States.", "I don't think OP is an asshole however I think she absolutely should have been keeping mom updated. I really, really don't know why she wouldn't. \n\nThis is the time of all times to stay in extra contact. \n\nMe and my sister are as she says \"soul mates\". I always ask before I just take her child and if I have her for awhile and we do multiple things I send a quick text/picture and say \"we are doing X now\". \n\nOnly once did she ever say no. My sister thought it was too dangerous. I thought she was wrong however I listened because that is her mom. She's in charge. \n\nIf I was in OPs shoes I would be doing the exact same thing except I would be sending pictures and updates.", "I love that's what you take from this LMAO", "Hard to tell first responders if you're splattered on the interstate", "That\u2019s literally all I said about my own family dynamic.", "They weren\u2019t. This made up risk you keep bringing up doesn\u2019t matter because it didn\u2019t happen.", "Ait den.", "I was never burned up at school, but we still have fire drills.  Just because it didn't happen doesn't mean you shouldn't be prepared just in case.  There's nothing wrong with wanting to know where your kids are.  I don't understand why people seem to be against it.  I never said OP was TA.  I do think that in the future OP should tell her where he's going when he has her kid, and if he doesn't then he would be an asshole and I stand by that statement no matter what level of monitoring other people give their children.  It's her kid.  She wants to know where they are.  She has that right, especially after specifying her wishes."]}
