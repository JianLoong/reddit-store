Sheesh! NTA", "NTA.  Can you have ME over for a few days :)", "You are a wonderful support system for you niece! NTA", "NTA If she doesn\u2019t trust you to keep her child safe while out she shouldn\u2019t of left her with you. Also she shouldn\u2019t expect you to stop living your lives because you have her child. You guys did her a favor and she sounds super ungrateful.", "NTA. She asked you to have her for a few days while her dad was in the hospital. For you to be giving her your itinerary every 30 minutes seems like it would be the AH thing to do. \n\nYou gave your niece a fun time and her parents didn\u2019t have to worry about her. Maybe she is just upset and misplacing her anger?", "NTA it sounds as if the mother is upset about a change in expectations after a mini-vacation with Fun Aunts.", "NTA. Did she expect you to do nothing and have no fun? Was she expecting her daughter to sit in quiet meditation thinking and praying for her father? If you ever get another chance with this kid, go for broke and show her the thrill of a lifetime.", "Personally I\u2019m going to say NTA, you were asked to step in and helped keep her distracted while her dad was in the hospital", "NTA.  Your SIL is overreacting because she is upset about her husband\u2019s medical crisis, so maybe give her grace for her irrationality on this issue.  If she trusted you to take full custody of her child for several days I\u2019m sure at some point in the past she would have explained any specific rules/requests she may have about caring for her daughter.  It is unreasonable to expect you to specifically seek permission for each location/outing.  Even summer camps only give you a general idea of the daily structure and there is an understanding that field trips will occur within a specific mile radius.  Unless in the past she specifically told you both to not take your niece places then you are perfectly fine here.  She should be thanking you for the help, not picking fights.", "INFO: Was her husband hospitalized due to an accident?  NTA either way, but your SIL may also be NTA, just stressed and overprotective right now.", "NTA. I would love to have a SIL like you!", "NTA - She sounds ungrateful, a control freak, and/or majorly stressed out from her husband's hospitalization. Most parents would be thrilled you cared enough to engage the cousins in fun outings at your expense. What exactly did you do wrong?", "NTA. I kinda get your SIL, specially if she is a helicopter parent, but making a big fuss about it seems she is actually the AH.\n\nI mean, you didn't take the kid out hunting, to a bullfighting ring or a boxing match, right? (The kind of activities I would be mad as a parent)", "NTA", "NTA most of these I'd be stoked if my kid came back and told me they'd done. Only one I can potentially see being an issue is the pool. Unless you know the child's swimming ability well then it can be a bit dangerous. This is coming from someone who had to be rescued at the pools because my swimming ability was absolutely zero, but that wasn't communicated very well to the other family well.", "NTA.   Did she expect you to drop any plans and stay home all day?   I'm assuming you had cellphones on you and returned to your home every evening, so you were reachable, and you didn't travel far enough away that you couldn't get her to your sister if needed..    Unless your niece has special needs that may make places unsafe for her, if she was with your family and properly supervised, nothing you did was unreasonable when you were asked to take her for multiple days.", "NTA. Your SIL was under a lot of stress that affected her judgment. Give her your understanding and let it go.", "INFO: Does she have a problem with any of the places you took her or does she simply not like not knowing where her child is? Because the latter is somewhat understandable IMO", "A soft NTA. you really should let people know where their kids are, especially when it's something like swimming or visiting a place full of strangers like an amusement park.  You're not the assholes because she should be checking in enough for the kid to tell her these things.  I know it's tough when someone is sick, but she still has a kid.  If she's super concerned about the kids whereabouts then she should get an air tag or smart watch for her.", "\u201cI dumped my child on you for days.

While I understand you wanted to make your niece's time with you special, not informing her mom that you were going out was a crap move.  You could have shot her a text.  So why didn't you?\n\nWhile I (a 17yo minor) was out with a friend and her mom heading to watch a movie, we got into a minor car accident.  Minor because while the side of the car was dented it was still drivable and there were no injuries.  We collectively made the decision to proceeded with our plans to the movies without informing my parents.  That was a huge mistake, when my parents found out they were livid not just at me (because I knew better), but also with the \"RESPONSIBLE ADULT\" who didn't think it was a big deal since nobody was hurt.   But it was a big deal, to my parents.  She was there with her daughter and so knew the severity of the accident, MY PARENTS were not and I, their daughter, was in the accident (minor or not).\n\nThis isn't about you taking your niece to these wonderful places, it's about you not being considerate to \"her parent.\"  I didn't have a cellphone, but I'm guessing you do, there is no excuse to not shoot a text saying where you were going and when, but you didn't and it was an irresponsible move.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She thought her kid was with you *at your home*, not gallavanting to various places where there are higher risks of injuries.\n\nI think you did a very kind thing that hopefully made it a little less scary for a 7yo who\u2019s parent is in the hospital, and the other parent is with them.\n\nAnd in the future you know at least with SIL, you can give her a heads up. (Notice she said notify, not ask permission.)", "NTA \n\nI bet if you had contacted her to let her know what you were doing she would have accused you of annoying her and stressing her out when she is trying to focus on her husband.\n\nPlease tell your SIL that if she doesn\u2018t trust you to look after her daughter and treat her like your own son then don\u2018t bother asking again no matter what the situation!!

If hailey was older then you can get away with it but again she\u2019s only 7.\n\nYour sister has to worry about her husband, she is under the impression that her daughter is at your house, but in fact, she is actually going to different places. You need to make her whereabouts known to her guardian at all times.\n\nIt does not matter if you decided to take her across the world or just go to the park, you just need to notify her mom.\nIt seems like your sister is not even upset that you took her out, it\u2019s just that you didn\u2019t make her aware.", "NTA, its not like you took her skydiving, it was normal family activities, you could get hurt simply driving to the places, did your sil expect you to let her know you're walking outside to the car every single time you left the house??", "NTA\n\nOff-topic, and serious question: if gay uncles are guncles, what's the cool name for lesbian aunts?", "SIL is nuts.

To me, this is helping  your niece by taking her mind off her dad and letting her be a kid instead of worrying about him being in the hospital. Maybe she just has anxiety from him being in the hospital and took it out on you guys. I'm sorry that happened when you were just treating your niece to fun activities like all cool aunts do! She asked for your help you provided it, I wonder if your niece wanted to go back to your house because of you guys doing all the fun things and the sister got jealous because of that.", "NTA did she call or contact you guys asking what you were doing or what the plan was?

Also she\u2019s 7 years old and they only just started asking about the activities that occurred over a few days, they didn\u2019t talk to her during that time or ask you what you all were up to?
