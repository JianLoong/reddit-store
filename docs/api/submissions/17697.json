Your SIL is overreacting because she is upset about her husband\u2019s medical crisis, so maybe give her grace for her irrationality on this issue.  If she trusted you to take full custody of her child for several days I\u2019m sure at some point in the past she would have explained any specific rules/requests she may have about caring for her daughter.  It is unreasonable to expect you to specifically seek permission for each location/outing.  Even summer camps only give you a general idea of the daily structure and there is an understanding that field trips will occur within a specific mile radius.

You're not the assholes because she should be checking in enough for the kid to tell her these things.  I know it's tough when someone is sick, but she still has a kid.  If she's super concerned about the kids whereabouts then she should get an air tag or smart watch for her.", "\u201cI dumped my child on you for days.

So why didn't you?\n\nWhile I (a 17yo minor) was out with a friend and her mom heading to watch a movie, we got into a minor car accident.  Minor because while the side of the car was dented it was still drivable and there were no injuries.  We collectively made the decision to proceeded with our plans to the movies without informing my parents.  That was a huge mistake, when my parents found out they were livid not just at me (because I knew better), but also with the \"RESPONSIBLE ADULT\" who didn't think it was a big deal since nobody was hurt.   But it was a big deal, to my parents.  She was there with her daughter and so knew the severity of the accident, MY PARENTS were not and I, their daughter, was in the accident (minor or not).\n\nThis isn't about you taking your niece to these wonderful places, it's about you not being considerate to \"her parent.\"  I didn't have a cellphone, but I'm guessing you do, there is no excuse to not shoot a text saying where you were going and when, but you didn't and it was an irresponsible move.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

To me, this is helping  your niece by taking her mind off her dad and letting her be a kid instead of worrying about him being in the hospital.

It reminds me of an EX friend who visited and tried to shame me for having 5 dog beds in the house.   Well I had a 15 year old Golden Retriever with chronic pain and separaqtion anxiety so there was a foam doggie bed in every room that we spend time in.    My ex mean friend mocked me for having so many dog beds.

You\u2019ve done your niece a favour.\n\nTo be fair to your SiL, she was probably just extra anxious after her husbands accident but it also has a ring of she doesn\u2019t trust you with her kid.

You know why?? Because now if something HAD happened, she wouldn\u2019t be confused as to why you guys ended up at a Zoo and not at your home where she just assumed her child to be.

She\u2019s stressed out and probably feels guilty about being away from her daughter (which is silly, but it\u2019s hard to be rational sometimes) and lashed at something absurd. Not that this makes it okay at all, but you don\u2019t need to worry you did anything wrong. She\u2019s going to feel really embarrassed once things settle down.

SiL is likely a little overly sensitive right now.

A little understanding on both sides would be helpful.", "NTA\n\nI volunteer as niece.\n\nYour SIL is an asshole. How is she not abundantly grateful that you kept her kid occupied.", "NTA. I\u2019d be ecstatic if my sibling took my kids somewhere fun for a few days. I can maybe understand if you were asking her to pay you back for the tickets and whatnot but since you aren\u2019t, wtf? Lol", "Nta.  As a fellow cool aunt you did nothing wrong.  Maybe your sil is just stressed out , no excuse but it sounds like emotions are high", "Definitely NTA. Like you said, you didn't do anything unusual and it's not like she couldn't just call you whenever to check in. \n\nLike what did she want specific permission to go to the pool, or the movies?", "NTA wasn\u2019t the whole point for you to take care of her so she could focus on her husband?", "NTA. Did SIL not call and check on her daughter at all while she was with you? Wouldn't your niece have wanted to hear how her father was doing and that her mom was ok? Wouldn't a mom want to talk to her 7 year old every day and hear that she was doing well in such a stressful time? NTA x1000.", "NTA\n\nThe phone call from SIL should have been to thank you for looking after her child in such a traumatic time for the child (dad in hospital, mom not available to child) and made it into happy, fun time.", "NTA. If she wanted updates, she could have asked at literally any point before she got her child back.", "COVID is the third highest cause of death in the US but I know it's very unpopular to point that out so, my personal opinion is that YTA but you wouldn't have been in the alternate universe where everyone stayed home for 3 weeks 3 years ago", "Since when do people who do nice things in time of crisis get thanked, and not berated?", "Probably 100% out of their own pockets too with no questions asked.", "And did a great job of keeping her distracted until her father was better!", "This is what I thought. Keeping her in the house and not occupy her would have done harm since she would be non stop worrying about her dad. \n\nHer aunts did an awesome job keeping her safe, her mind occupied, and having fun all at once. \n\nThese aunts honestly are stellar. NTA", "that was my first thought!", "OP should absolutely not watch niece again until SIL gives an apology for this. You can't just dump your kid on someone for several days, not check in, and then scream at them about how they handled that. I mean fi she was that worried why the fuck didn't she call or something?", "This, sister is TA but she\u2019s just reacting in a \u201csafe to be angry\u201d mode. She\u2019s not in her right frame of mind now.", "That\u2019s my guess as well.", "Yes! She didn't need to understand the severity of the situation. She needed to know he was sick and getting help from the doctors who were taking very good care of him. There was no reason to worry a little kid and have her sitting at home thinking about every bad thing she can imagine happening. \n\nI understand the mental disconnect of being freaked out that your husband was just in the hospital while your kid is bouncing around and chattering nonstop about the fun they had. It's hard to put that emotional state of fear aside and put on the big smile while you ask the kid what her favorite animal at the zoo was. That's part of the job when you've got littles.", "I agree. Given the fact that she\u2019s just 7. If it was my daughter, I\u2019d like to have a update about her. I don\u2019t mean that I should know every single thing, but sure about her whereabouts. I\u2019m happy for the cool aunts and the fun stuff, not AH for that. i think people in reddit are missing the actual point about why SIL was upset. She should have thanked, but that\u2019s different right", "If something happened they could just call each other", " My cousin's mom and her sister (my aunts) got sloppy drunk, cornered me in the bathroom, and started blubbering about how my future wedding ...", "\ud83d\udcaf to all of the responses.\n\nJust SMDH ... SIL is a Super-Asshole, and I hope they never do anything for her family again (at least not until she apologizes).", "This!! Her Dad was in the hospital and not doing well! NTA at all", "Still an AH because she shouldn\u2019t take out her anxiety on people who did her such a big favour in the first place", "That anxiety is going to destroy her daughter's life unless she gets it under control, it already is. So definitely the asshole.", "If it's that important to her to know what her daughter is doing she can call or text herself. In OP's shoes I would absolutely never watch that kid again under any circumstances.", "Or set that expectation beforehand. But like, she's dealing with her husband being hospitalized you'd think she wouldn't want phone calls all the time asking for permission to take the kid places."]}
