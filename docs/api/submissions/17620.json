You\u2019re also looking for an easy solution instead of talking to the school regarding your daughter\u2019s bully.", "Yeah. YTA. Your daughter has confided in you that a situation makes her feel unsafe. By ignoring her perspective and forcing her to ride the bus, you\u2019re communicating that her feelings are not important to you, nor can she trust that you\u2019ll listen to her when she does have a problem. Youre her dad. She wants you to protect her, and to be blunt, that\u2019s your job.", "YTA for saying that your daughter needs to \u201cface the bullies instead of finding an easy out\u201d, she is only 11, it\u2019s going to be difficult for her to stand up for herself and if the bullying continues you will see some personality changes in your daughter pretty soon because it takes quite a toll on someone. You need to help her and not just let her face this by herself. It\u2019s not wrong for her to continue taking the bus but talk to the bully\u2019s parents, talk to him, talk to the school, tell your daughter specifically how to handle it etc and don\u2019t just say she needs to do it herself - she probably doesn\u2019t know how.\n\nEdit: fixed some spelling", "YTA. As someone who was in the exact situation your daughter is in now, your behavior tells your daughter that you do not care about her situation and that she cannot trust you with issues later on in life and will make her feel like you do not care about her in general. Independence is important, but what you're teaching her is way more than independence, it's teaching her that she can't depend on you literally at all.", "Yes, you're the asshole. This isn't about her keeping her independence. This is about allowing an 11 year old child to navigate being bullied alone. She took the biggest step in coming to you as her parents, adults she should be able to trust to help her and protect her, to get help. Not to be left to fend for herself because her pathetic excuse for a \"father\" is too emotionally stunted to help her. Ffs.", "Yta. My dad would've been at the bus stop ready to talk to the driver and the bully the next morning. You expect her to just deal with it? She's 11 \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA.   bullying is very serious, and you are basically telling your child that she is on her own dealing with it.    \n\n\nhonestly, in what other situation would we say 'here, random human who passed a drug test.  Here are 40-75 children, ages 5-19.  Please keep them all safe and well for the next couple of hours.  Oh, and operate this piece of heavy machinery while you do it.\"    \n\n\nSchool buses are basically Lord of the Flies on wheels.   There isn't an adult situation--except perhaps a prison yard?  No, even a prison yard has more supervision--that equates to a public school bus.   If your child is struggling with the school bus and you can easily remove that obstacle from their life, why wouldn't you?", "YTA\n\nyour daughter is 11.\n\nBullying will ruin people emotionally. I can't imagine how hard everything is for her. \n\n**Her dad and mom standing up for her will asssure her that the bully is the wrong one here.** She'll learn how to stand against a bully on seeing how her dad and mom stand up for her. Thus, she will gain confidence and strength to fight through it. \n\nWhat you're suggesting is simply let that child be without any support and making her doubt about herself.\n\n Congratulations on ruining your daughter's self worth and confidence!", "YTA. \"Facing your bully\" is bullshit, you're just forcing her to endure further trauma. Bullying isn't just an annoying thing kids have to deal with. Stop normalizing it. It's abusive and traumatic and can cause lifelong issues. Being dismissed by the people she's supposed to be able to trust will just add to that. Bullies don't care and it's likely the school and administration don't either. Anything she says or does in her own defense will likely only end up hurting her. You're not doing anything to help her become independent. Sometimes kids need help. Sometimes *adults* need help. All you're teaching her is that she shouldn't bother to ask for help when she needs it because she won't get it. As an independent adult, if she's \"bullied\" (bullying is called harassment when it happens to adults), she can report the person to HR or file a complaint and be taken seriously. Why would you expect a kid to handle it on their own?", "YTA - it sounds like you're just brushing her off & not taking her seriously. How about helping her find a better solution, such as talking to the school about the situation?", "INFO: Okay, if you want her to make her own decisions, have you asked what her opinion is? Would she like you to drive her to school or not? Have you actually talked with her to help her navigate this bullying? Have you talked to the school, teachers, the bus driver?", "YTA. Get your priorities straight.", "YTA. Kids do not have training in how to handle bullies, and most schools do not enforce rules against bullying and will punish children who try to deal with bullying themselves.\n\nWhat you've done is teach your daughter that you're fine with her being bullied, and that you're not willing to put in a small amount of effort in order to protect her. She may even be feeling like you agree with her bully.\n\nYou're her parent. It's your responsibility to protect her from people who want to harm her. It would be far better to SHOW her how to protect children from bullies than to expect her to do this all by herself.", "Hmm, 11 years old still seems too young to be 'independent'. Sure, some kids can be strong and stand up to bullies on their own, but most kids that age don't. To tell the truth, I was bullied as a child too, and I fought the bullies on my own, but in my heart I always thought how good it would be if my parents did something instead of letting me handle things like that.\r  \nI think you should have a talk and suggest what she can or shouldn't do - if you insist on letting her 'face the bully' like that. So I guess this is a soft YTA when you did nothing and left her alone. In short, kids are cruel, and you're a parent in 2023, not 1993 or 2003, so do something about it.", "YTA\n\nNext time something like this happens, your daughter will not be so inclined to come to you. Is this what you want? You have just made your daughter feel like she has to face problems on her own. Good job, OP, AH of the year.", "YTA, you\u2019re not taking her bullying seriously out of connivence to yourself, and these types of things will continue to effect your child\u2019s life years from now.", "YTA.\n\nAn eleven-year-old should not be expected to stop bullies on her own.  You and your wife should be taking a multipronged approach.  You need to report it to the school and push for them to supervise the buses properly and not allow retaliation during the school day.  Unless/until the school can ensure your daughter's safety on the bus, you should be helping her get to school another way.    \n\n\nYou are being selfish and lacking awareness.  In the 21st century, it's no longer believed appropriate to expect victims to put a stop to their own bullying.  I wonder if you have some history with your own childhood experiences?", "YTA. She found a solution. She asked someonr she loves and trusts to help her avoid a problematic situation. Dont worry about the lesson, life will give many more chances", "YTA. While it's a gray area, I agree with your wife that you are not taking bullying seriously enough. I would think differently if you were actively involved with instructing your daughter on how to most effectively handle the situation *and* if you drew a line beyond which you had to take matters into your own hands.", "Oh buddy. YTA", "YTA. She's 11, she feels unsafe, and you, the one man she should be able to rely on to keep her feeling safe, think she should just suck it up.", "well you're correct that you're teaching your daughter a lesson. you're teaching her number of lessons\n\n1 - that her parents won't protect her\n\n2 - that her parents won't let make certain decisions to protect herself. because choosing to leave an environment or situation in which someone is bullying or harassing you is absolutely a valid way of managing a bully. enabling your daughter to make the best decision for her in this situation would be talking to her and asking HER what SHE wants (which may be to not take the bus anymore). instead YOU are forcing the solution YOU want\n\n3 - that life is traumatic and people with power over her (including her parents) can make her miserable and she should just tolerate it and can't do anything about it until she's an adult and isn't prevented from making her own choices \n\nare those the lessons you're trying to teach your daughter? because that's what she's going to be discussing in therapy as an adult\n\nI don't know if it's just because you're just fucking lazy (your wife's theory), or if you don't care about your daughter, or if you genuinely believe that traumatising and hurting her is good for her. maybe you genuinely believe that you need to use your power over her to show her just how little power and agency she has\n\nbut it doesn't matter, whichever way you slice it, yes, YTA\n\nand you sound like one of those parents totally surprised that their kid committed suicide who bemoans that their child didn't come to them, despite the parent very clearly establishing that coming to them would do fuck all\n\ndon't be one of those parents. don't be one of those parents whose kid is permanently traumatised in their pre teen or teen years in ways that were totally avoidable", "YTA\nYour daughter is standing up for herself by asking you for help rather than suffer in silence. You have the opportunity to teach her 3 of the most valuable lessons anyone can have in life: \n\n1. Needing help doesn't make you weak. It takes courage to ask others for it. \n\n2.If you see something wrong happening to someone you should help them not just be a passive bystander. \n\n3. Everyone makes mistakes, even her dad, but what is important is that we own up to them, learn from them, and try to be better.", "YTA. Sorry, but I don\u2019t buy your Independence line. I think you\u2019re just too damn lazy to get yourself out of the house at 6:45 to take her to school.  She doesn\u2019t feel safe. It\u2019s time to be a parent and be there for her.", "I was bullied on the school bus when I was 12.

Do you want her to make a similar choice?\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYou rather let your daughter be called a \"whore\" than taking her to school where she can be safe being taken.

Ask me how I know\u2026", "I just had to suspend a parent from attending the bus stop for the remainder of the school year because she swore at some of the elementary school students. I wish OP and his wife would call the school and require that they resolve this and discipline the errant student. \n\nManaging transportation and student behavior is someone's job. Oftentimes transportation issues and student discipline intersect. Contact the people in the job and tell them what happened and what you need to happen, OP.", "Ha, good luck with that.", "LOL because schools do such a great job of addressing violence and emotional distress\u2026", "Jesus Christ, dude.", "Let me guess. Your parents do the exact same thing by ignoring your needs for protection & care (or whatever) and you think just because _you_ made it out alive then EVERYONE should be able to deal with it too.", "Then what would you suggest?", "To be fair, that's where you hold the school legally responsible for her well being while in their care. They have a  Zero tolerance policy, I support it working both ways.", "Don't forget it can also cause suicide. Alot of kids die for suicide due to bullying and people not caring. A girl just died in n.j after suicide in a bathroom due to bullying.  Like it can cause so much worse stuff . I hope op realizes that his daughter likely will not be the same soon", "Lol, and yet I get downvoted for having successfully used exactly what I suggested.", "Considering I the success in an almost identical situation involving my own child, I would say no luck is needed. The power of the pen is a phenomenon they can't escape, especially once they fully understand the legal ramifications of their failure to follow their own policy.", "I am kinda feeling bad for WVwoodsman. I wonder what happened to him.", "That he drive her to school so she doesn\u2019t have to ride the bus with her bullies.", "Until the bullying switches to outside the school where they can\u2019t do anything about it.  I\u2019m glad it worked for you, but you are in the minority on that.  They poster elsewhere who said they more often than not getting the school involved makes bullying worse was correct.", "Or that she learn to deal with bullies on her own", "Because the parents also lacked balls. If it happens outside the school, you take out a restraining order, and dgaf that it's a minor. Hold the parents accountable, and have a lawyer put them on notice of a potential lawsuit. It's absolutely beatable. Alternatively teach the daughter to fight and rip an eye out. But ffs don't put up with it.", "Why don\u2019t you join us in the 21st century, where we know \u201cjust deal with it yourself\u201d is an ineffective approach to bullying.", "She's trying to do that by *telling her parents*. For fuck's sake, that's what kids are told to do, tell an authority figure when they feel unsafe. But durr hurr hurr dEaL wItH iT oN hEr OwN hurr hurr.", "I was told that a lot. I got bullied from ages 11-15, so yeah, see what good that does. The only reason the bullying stopped was because covid happened, then I moved to a school where no one knew me. Suck it up and protect your daughter, ffs.", "Oh great one, please enlighten us that how do you expect her to put stop to the bullying (being called a whore) without alerting the school administration \ud83d\ude2f. I mean i don't know i thought we had our parents to stand up for us when we are unable to. I mean seriously how can someone be calm and all while their onlu daughter is being called such vile names and say \"omg fucking stand up for yourself you fully functioning adult you i wannaaa sleep\""]}
