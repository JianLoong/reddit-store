You\u2019re also looking for an easy solution instead of talking to the school regarding your daughter\u2019s bully.", "Yeah. YTA. Your daughter has confided in you that a situation makes her feel unsafe. By ignoring her perspective and forcing her to ride the bus, you\u2019re communicating that her feelings are not important to you, nor can she trust that you\u2019ll listen to her when she does have a problem. Youre her dad. She wants you to protect her, and to be blunt, that\u2019s your job.", "YTA for saying that your daughter needs to \u201cface the bullies instead of finding an easy out\u201d, she is only 11, it\u2019s going to be difficult for her to stand up for herself and if the bullying continues you will see some personality changes in your daughter pretty soon because it takes quite a toll on someone. You need to help her and not just let her face this by herself. It\u2019s not wrong for her to continue taking the bus but talk to the bully\u2019s parents, talk to him, talk to the school, tell your daughter specifically how to handle it etc and don\u2019t just say she needs to do it herself - she probably doesn\u2019t know how.\n\nEdit: fixed some spelling", "YTA. As someone who was in the exact situation your daughter is in now, your behavior tells your daughter that you do not care about her situation and that she cannot trust you with issues later on in life and will make her feel like you do not care about her in general. Independence is important, but what you're teaching her is way more than independence, it's teaching her that she can't depend on you literally at all.", "Yes, you're the asshole. This isn't about her keeping her independence. This is about allowing an 11 year old child to navigate being bullied alone. She took the biggest step in coming to you as her parents, adults she should be able to trust to help her and protect her, to get help. Not to be left to fend for herself because her pathetic excuse for a \"father\" is too emotionally stunted to help her. Ffs.", "Yta. My dad would've been at the bus stop ready to talk to the driver and the bully the next morning. You expect her to just deal with it? She's 11 \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA.   bullying is very serious, and you are basically telling your child that she is on her own dealing with it.    \n\n\nhonestly, in what other situation would we say 'here, random human who passed a drug test.  Here are 40-75 children, ages 5-19.  Please keep them all safe and well for the next couple of hours.  Oh, and operate this piece of heavy machinery while you do it.\"    \n\n\nSchool buses are basically Lord of the Flies on wheels.   There isn't an adult situation--except perhaps a prison yard?  No, even a prison yard has more supervision--that equates to a public school bus.   If your child is struggling with the school bus and you can easily remove that obstacle from their life, why wouldn't you?", "YTA\n\nyour daughter is 11.\n\nBullying will ruin people emotionally. I can't imagine how hard everything is for her. \n\n**Her dad and mom standing up for her will asssure her that the bully is the wrong one here.** She'll learn how to stand against a bully on seeing how her dad and mom stand up for her. Thus, she will gain confidence and strength to fight through it. \n\nWhat you're suggesting is simply let that child be without any support and making her doubt about herself.\n\n Congratulations on ruining your daughter's self worth and confidence!", "YTA. Bullying isn't just an annoying thing kids have to deal with. It doesn't build character or teach problem-solving skills. It doesn't \"prepare them for the real world.\"  It's abusive and traumatic and can cause lifelong issues. Being dismissed by the people she's supposed to be able to trust will just add to that. Stop normalizing it. Children of your daughter's age (and *younger*) unalive themselves because of it with frightening regularity.  \"Facing your bully\" is bullshit, you're just forcing her to endure further trauma. Bullies don't care and it's likely the school and administration don't either. Anything she says or does in her own defense will likely only end up hurting her.  You're not doing anything to help her become independent. Sometimes kids need help. Sometimes *adults* need help. All you're teaching her is that she shouldn't bother to ask for help when she needs it because she won't get it. As an independent adult, if she's \"bullied\" (bullying is called harassment when it happens to adults), she can report the person to HR or file a complaint or police report and be taken seriously. Why would you expect an 11 year old child to handle it on their own?", "YTA - it sounds like you're just brushing her off & not taking her seriously. How about helping her find a better solution, such as talking to the school about the situation?", "INFO: Okay, if you want her to make her own decisions, have you asked what her opinion is? Would she like you to drive her to school or not? Have you actually talked with her to help her navigate this bullying? Have you talked to the school, teachers, the bus driver?", "YTA. Get your priorities straight.", "YTA. Kids do not have training in how to handle bullies, and most schools do not enforce rules against bullying and will punish children who try to deal with bullying themselves.\n\nWhat you've done is teach your daughter that you're fine with her being bullied, and that you're not willing to put in a small amount of effort in order to protect her. She may even be feeling like you agree with her bully.\n\nYou're her parent. It's your responsibility to protect her from people who want to harm her. It would be far better to SHOW her how to protect children from bullies than to expect her to do this all by herself.", "Hmm, 11 years old still seems too young to be 'independent'. Sure, some kids can be strong and stand up to bullies on their own, but most kids that age don't. To tell the truth, I was bullied as a child too, and I fought the bullies on my own, but in my heart I always thought how good it would be if my parents did something instead of letting me handle things like that.\r  \nI think you should have a talk and suggest what she can or shouldn't do - if you insist on letting her 'face the bully' like that. So I guess this is a soft YTA when you did nothing and left her alone. In short, kids are cruel, and you're a parent in 2023, not 1993 or 2003, so do something about it.", "YTA\n\nNext time something like this happens, your daughter will not be so inclined to come to you. Is this what you want? You have just made your daughter feel like she has to face problems on her own. Good job, OP, AH of the year.", "YTA, you\u2019re not taking her bullying seriously out of connivence to yourself, and these types of things will continue to effect your child\u2019s life years from now.", "YTA.\n\nAn eleven-year-old should not be expected to stop bullies on her own.  You and your wife should be taking a multipronged approach.  You need to report it to the school and push for them to supervise the buses properly and not allow retaliation during the school day.  Unless/until the school can ensure your daughter's safety on the bus, you should be helping her get to school another way.    \n\n\nYou are being selfish and lacking awareness.  In the 21st century, it's no longer believed appropriate to expect victims to put a stop to their own bullying.  I wonder if you have some history with your own childhood experiences?", "YTA. She found a solution. She asked someonr she loves and trusts to help her avoid a problematic situation. Dont worry about the lesson, life will give many more chances", "YTA. While it's a gray area, I agree with your wife that you are not taking bullying seriously enough. I would think differently if you were actively involved with instructing your daughter on how to most effectively handle the situation *and* if you drew a line beyond which you had to take matters into your own hands.", "Oh buddy. YTA", "YTA. She's 11, she feels unsafe, and you, the one man she should be able to rely on to keep her feeling safe, think she should just suck it up.", "well you're correct that you're teaching your daughter a lesson. you're teaching her number of lessons\n\n1 - that her parents won't protect her\n\n2 - that her parents won't let make certain decisions to protect herself. because choosing to leave an environment or situation in which someone is bullying or harassing you is absolutely a valid way of managing a bully. enabling your daughter to make the best decision for her in this situation would be talking to her and asking HER what SHE wants (which may be to not take the bus anymore). instead YOU are forcing the solution YOU want\n\n3 - that life is traumatic and people with power over her (including her parents) can make her miserable and she should just tolerate it and can't do anything about it until she's an adult and isn't prevented from making her own choices \n\nare those the lessons you're trying to teach your daughter? because that's what she's going to be discussing in therapy as an adult\n\nI don't know if it's just because you're just fucking lazy (your wife's theory), or if you don't care about your daughter, or if you genuinely believe that traumatising and hurting her is good for her. maybe you genuinely believe that you need to use your power over her to show her just how little power and agency she has\n\nbut it doesn't matter, whichever way you slice it, yes, YTA\n\nand you sound like one of those parents totally surprised that their kid committed suicide who bemoans that their child didn't come to them, despite the parent very clearly establishing that coming to them would do fuck all\n\ndon't be one of those parents. don't be one of those parents whose kid is permanently traumatised in their pre teen or teen years in ways that were totally avoidable", "YTA\nYour daughter is standing up for herself by asking you for help rather than suffer in silence. You have the opportunity to teach her 3 of the most valuable lessons anyone can have in life: \n\n1. Needing help doesn't make you weak. It takes courage to ask others for it. \n\n2.If you see something wrong happening to someone you should help them not just be a passive bystander. \n\n3. Everyone makes mistakes, even her dad, but what is important is that we own up to them, learn from them, and try to be better.", "YTA. Sorry, but I don\u2019t buy your Independence line. I think you\u2019re just too damn lazy to get yourself out of the house at 6:45 to take her to school.  She doesn\u2019t feel safe. It\u2019s time to be a parent and be there for her.", "I was bullied on the school bus when I was 12.

Do you want her to make a similar choice?\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYou rather let your daughter be called a \"whore\" than taking her to school where she can be safe being taken.

This is why bullying is such a difficult thing to address, in principle there are a number of different resolutions, all of which should work, but they all fall down in practice unless you're particularly lucky.\n\nThe school should be able to stop this in a hot second, but even when they recognise it's happening a proportionate response against just the bully just escalates the situation.\n\nIgnoring it should work, they're after a rise out of you, but it doesn't because they know if they push hard enough they'll get something eventually, and in a closed situation like a bus they literally have nothing else to do.\n\nFighting back should work, but a lot of the time it doesn't because you've escalated the situation to formal notice and \\_you\\_ were the one who did it, the schools hands are often tied in terms of how they respond to violence regardless of the provocation, and unless you got lucky you won't have dealt with the bullying.\n\nParental involvement should work, but often the parents or family situation is an underlying cause\u2014either the parents support their own kid, causing a backfire, or the parents fail to manage the behaviour, motivating the bully more.\n\nWhat we do know is the social group itself can stop it reliably. Bullying requires a permissive social environment, bullies can't be effective if they have an audience that will intervene. This is why work cultures can make bullying disappear if they want to, even when it seems nearly impossible for schools to do so.\n\nIn the example above, the bully is only succeeding because the rest of the bus is accepting it (if not encouraging it), and as a society we don't believe it's appropriate to collectively punish the bus for its unwillingness to intervene.\n\nThis is why I ultimately agree with people saying OP should change their position\u2014avoiding the bus avoids that grouping which is accepting the bullying, and as we have discussed the victim has no reliable options of their own to address the issue, none at least that they can put into effect at age 11. They may face a similar risk at school but the social group there is different (even if the bully is present, they can't effectively bully if the group doesn't permit it) and she may not be exposed there as a result.\n\nI also believe, in all honesty, that the way we try and address bullying through the bully (beyond ensuring that they're aware what they're doing is bullying) is a waste of time unless you can exclude them completely.

She has no power in this situation, and neither the school bus driver nor the school administration are likely to intervene without someone with power - i.e. an adult like her father - demanding action. She can't secure other means of transportation; she's too young to have friends she can ride with, or be able to ride herself. If she's picked up at 6:45, she's definitely too far from the school to walk. If the boy was inclined to stop because she asked or because she was upset, he would have \\_done so already\\_.

When my daughter was in kindergarten and first grade there was an older girl bullying her on the bus. I spoke to the bus driver, the bus driver helper, the school administration, her teacher\u2026the older girl was kicked off the bus temporarily several times. After a while she realized she wasn\u2019t getting under my daughter\u2019s skin anymore, and I thought it had all stopped.

An eight years old child, contemplating death rather than deal with bullying, from this same problem child that the school had been aware of for years at this point. I walked straight into that office and it took everything in me not to yell at the assistant principal, because at this point it\u2019s a seventh grader picking on a second grader, who was new to the school. \n\n\nIn our situation, I talked to the parents of the other bullied child, and her parents also raised hell, even more than I did. Within a couple months the bully was expelled from school for fighting. I don\u2019t think she ever totally stopped bullying little kids. I doubt she had a very good home life, but I really don\u2019t know. \n\n\nMy point here is You want to be a parent? You need to advocate for your child when it calls for it.

She'll carry it when boys won't take no for an answer. She'll carry it if, god forbid, a persistent \"suitor\" crosses the line into stalking, or a partner begins to put her down or verbally abuse her or worse - she'll hear your voice in her head telling her she doesn't matter enough to help.\n\nIf you take her seriously now - start driving her to school for a few weeks, raise the complaint about the bullying with school officials, make it clear that you won't stand for your daughter to be treated this way, set clear expectations that everyone from the principal to the bus driver is responsible for maintaining your daughter's safety from this boy, and start actually TEACHING her and SHOWING her how to stand up for herself instead of expecting her to \"figure it out\" at 11, she'll grow up confident that she can speak up when something's not right.\n\nI won't even make you ask me how I know.

(My Mum too, for that matter.) Dad told me to stand up to the bullies, Mum told me to ignore them. They sent me to the most notorious school in the area because it was close enough to walk.\n\nI was bullied, badly. Verbal bullying crossed into physical several times, but verbal was somehow worse. Standing up to them resulted in getting punched in the face, ignoring them meant they ramped up the verbal until I broke.\n\nThose four years showed me I couldn't rely on my parents.

And you'll have no one to blame but yourself.\n\nPlus... he's calling her all these things and you do NOTHING? We get it, you're a horrible parent who hates their kid. Yikes", "Yeah, YTA. I'm a psychologist in my day job, if it makes any difference. Absolutely it's good to teach children age-appropriate independence, problem-solving, etc.\n\nHowever, that NEVER involves keeping a child in an abusive situation (which bullying is) - and expecting them to just 'deal' with it. Children must ALWAYS be protected from that, or they suffer varying degrees of unacceptable fear, misery - and usually, lasting emotional damage. This isn't a fantasy film, where the kid suddenly prevails and knocks out their bully. The reality is she is trapped in this situation, with NO WAY to stop the bully/abuse. \n\nBullies NEVER stop, if they don't want to, no matter what their victims say to them. They just laugh, and up the ante. It's nothing to do with the skill, courage, etc. of the victim - it's just how bullying mentalities work. He already knows she personally can't stop him, and that's why he picked her. It's also likely to escalate, as he realises nobody is going to intervene. So adult intervention IS required. \n\nThis is NOT age-appropriate 'problem-solving' to expect of her. This is simply your own inadequate parenting, quite frankly, dressed up in your mind as a 'life lesson' - with the underlying motive mainly being your own convenience. And you're willing to let your daughter be called a whore, fat, terrorised, develop nervous problems about going to school, suffer severe unhappiness all day (bullying usually causes major unhappiness even when it's not happening), possible mental health problems, etc. Mainly because you want to sleep in - and so you are disingenuously convincing yourself it will do her 'good', to be abused every day. \n\nWhat a risk to take with your child. You'll also damage her sense of safety in you (which she can rightfully expect you - her parent - to protect her. When kids lose that trust at such an age, they suffer even more long-term damage). Hell, bullying's not even something adults should be expected to tolerate on an ongoing basis (bullying and harassment, etc. at work, for example, makes many people ill). If abusers won't stop their behaviour towards adults, organisations should rightfully remove the victim from the situation. And because kids are less psychologically developed, the mental health damage is worse. You need to do a better job here. I'm sorry to say, you ARE failing.", "A great deal of women are introduced to sexuality via sexual harassment like this, or even sexual assault. I include myself in that unfortunate club, and it actually made it even harder to ask a parent for help because I basically didn't have the words to describe or the knowledge to fully comprehend what was happening. And obviously, being sexualized like that made it even scarier and more embarrassing to talk to an adult about.\n\nThe fact that OP's daughter is in the same boat and was undoubtedly unimaginably humiliated to have to talk about herself in any kind of sexual manner with her parents, and now OP gives absolutely no shits and is telling her to deal with it herself, will probably form her perception of how to handle sexual harassment for the rest of her life (i.e. not even my father cares or thinks this is a problem so I better just put up with it and try to pretend it's not traumatizing).", "I mean but that\u2019s assuming the 11 yo didn\u2019t do anything to provoke being called a whore right?", "I already mentioned that in another comment.
