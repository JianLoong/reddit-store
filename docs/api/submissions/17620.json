You\u2019re also looking for an easy solution instead of talking to the school regarding your daughter\u2019s bully.", "Yeah. YTA. Your daughter has confided in you that a situation makes her feel unsafe. By ignoring her perspective and forcing her to ride the bus, you\u2019re communicating that her feelings are not important to you, nor can she trust that you\u2019ll listen to her when she does have a problem. Youre her dad. She wants you to protect her, and to be blunt, that\u2019s your job.", "YTA for saying that your daughter needs to \u201cface the bullies instead of finding an easy out\u201d, she is only 11, it\u2019s going to be difficult for her to stand up for herself and if the bullying continues you will see some personality changes in your daughter pretty soon because it takes quite a toll on someone. You need to help her and not just let her face this by herself. It\u2019s not wrong for her to continue taking the bus but talk to the bully\u2019s parents, talk to him, talk to the school, tell your daughter specifically how to handle it etc and don\u2019t just say she needs to do it herself - she probably doesn\u2019t know how.\n\nEdit: fixed some spelling", "YTA. As someone who was in the exact situation your daughter is in now, your behavior tells your daughter that you do not care about her situation and that she cannot trust you with issues later on in life and will make her feel like you do not care about her in general. Independence is important, but what you're teaching her is way more than independence, it's teaching her that she can't depend on you literally at all.", "Yes, you're the asshole. This isn't about her keeping her independence. This is about allowing an 11 year old child to navigate being bullied alone. She took the biggest step in coming to you as her parents, adults she should be able to trust to help her and protect her, to get help. Not to be left to fend for herself because her pathetic excuse for a \"father\" is too emotionally stunted to help her. Ffs.", "Yta. My dad would've been at the bus stop ready to talk to the driver and the bully the next morning. You expect her to just deal with it? She's 11 \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA.   bullying is very serious, and you are basically telling your child that she is on her own dealing with it.    \n\n\nhonestly, in what other situation would we say 'here, random human who passed a drug test.  Here are 40-75 children, ages 5-19.  Please keep them all safe and well for the next couple of hours.  Oh, and operate this piece of heavy machinery while you do it.\"    \n\n\nSchool buses are basically Lord of the Flies on wheels.   There isn't an adult situation--except perhaps a prison yard?  No, even a prison yard has more supervision--that equates to a public school bus.   If your child is struggling with the school bus and you can easily remove that obstacle from their life, why wouldn't you?", "YTA\n\nyour daughter is 11.\n\nBullying will ruin people emotionally. I can't imagine how hard everything is for her. \n\n**Her dad and mom standing up for her will asssure her that the bully is the wrong one here.** She'll learn how to stand against a bully on seeing how her dad and mom stand up for her. Thus, she will gain confidence and strength to fight through it. \n\nWhat you're suggesting is simply let that child be without any support and making her doubt about herself.\n\n Congratulations on ruining your daughter's self worth and confidence!", "YTA. Bullying isn't just an annoying thing kids have to deal with. It doesn't build character or teach problem-solving skills. It doesn't \"prepare them for the real world.\"  It's abusive and traumatic and can cause lifelong issues. Stop normalizing it. Children of your daughter's age (and *younger*) unalive themselves because of it with frightening regularity. Being dismissed by the people she's supposed to be able to trust will just add to that. \"Facing your bully\" is bullshit, you're just forcing her to endure further trauma. Bullies don't care and it's likely the school and administration don't either. Anything she says or does in her own defense will likely only end up hurting her.  You're not doing anything to help her become independent. Sometimes kids need help. Sometimes *adults* need help. All you're teaching her is that she shouldn't bother to ask for help when she needs it because she won't get it. As an independent adult, if she's \"bullied\" (bullying is called harassment when it happens to adults), she can report the person to HR or file a complaint or police report and be taken seriously. Why would you expect an 11 year old child to handle it on their own?", "YTA - it sounds like you're just brushing her off & not taking her seriously. How about helping her find a better solution, such as talking to the school about the situation?", "INFO: Okay, if you want her to make her own decisions, have you asked what her opinion is? Would she like you to drive her to school or not? Have you actually talked with her to help her navigate this bullying? Have you talked to the school, teachers, the bus driver?", "YTA. Get your priorities straight.", "YTA. Kids do not have training in how to handle bullies, and most schools do not enforce rules against bullying and will punish children who try to deal with bullying themselves.\n\nWhat you've done is teach your daughter that you're fine with her being bullied, and that you're not willing to put in a small amount of effort in order to protect her. She may even be feeling like you agree with her bully.\n\nYou're her parent. It's your responsibility to protect her from people who want to harm her. It would be far better to SHOW her how to protect children from bullies than to expect her to do this all by herself.", "Hmm, 11 years old still seems too young to be 'independent'. Sure, some kids can be strong and stand up to bullies on their own, but most kids that age don't. To tell the truth, I was bullied as a child too, and I fought the bullies on my own, but in my heart I always thought how good it would be if my parents did something instead of letting me handle things like that.\r  \nI think you should have a talk and suggest what she can or shouldn't do - if you insist on letting her 'face the bully' like that. So I guess this is a soft YTA when you did nothing and left her alone. In short, kids are cruel, and you're a parent in 2023, not 1993 or 2003, so do something about it.", "YTA\n\nNext time something like this happens, your daughter will not be so inclined to come to you. Is this what you want? You have just made your daughter feel like she has to face problems on her own. Good job, OP, AH of the year.", "YTA, you\u2019re not taking her bullying seriously out of connivence to yourself, and these types of things will continue to effect your child\u2019s life years from now.", "YTA.\n\nAn eleven-year-old should not be expected to stop bullies on her own.  You and your wife should be taking a multipronged approach.  You need to report it to the school and push for them to supervise the buses properly and not allow retaliation during the school day.  Unless/until the school can ensure your daughter's safety on the bus, you should be helping her get to school another way.    \n\n\nYou are being selfish and lacking awareness.  In the 21st century, it's no longer believed appropriate to expect victims to put a stop to their own bullying.  I wonder if you have some history with your own childhood experiences?", "YTA. She found a solution. She asked someonr she loves and trusts to help her avoid a problematic situation. Dont worry about the lesson, life will give many more chances", "YTA. While it's a gray area, I agree with your wife that you are not taking bullying seriously enough. I would think differently if you were actively involved with instructing your daughter on how to most effectively handle the situation *and* if you drew a line beyond which you had to take matters into your own hands.", "Oh buddy. YTA", "YTA. She's 11, she feels unsafe, and you, the one man she should be able to rely on to keep her feeling safe, think she should just suck it up.", "well you're correct that you're teaching your daughter a lesson. you're teaching her number of lessons\n\n1 - that her parents won't protect her\n\n2 - that her parents won't let make certain decisions to protect herself. because choosing to leave an environment or situation in which someone is bullying or harassing you is absolutely a valid way of managing a bully. enabling your daughter to make the best decision for her in this situation would be talking to her and asking HER what SHE wants (which may be to not take the bus anymore). instead YOU are forcing the solution YOU want\n\n3 - that life is traumatic and people with power over her (including her parents) can make her miserable and she should just tolerate it and can't do anything about it until she's an adult and isn't prevented from making her own choices \n\nare those the lessons you're trying to teach your daughter? because that's what she's going to be discussing in therapy as an adult\n\nI don't know if it's just because you're just fucking lazy (your wife's theory), or if you don't care about your daughter, or if you genuinely believe that traumatising and hurting her is good for her. maybe you genuinely believe that you need to use your power over her to show her just how little power and agency she has\n\nbut it doesn't matter, whichever way you slice it, yes, YTA\n\nand you sound like one of those parents totally surprised that their kid committed suicide who bemoans that their child didn't come to them, despite the parent very clearly establishing that coming to them would do fuck all\n\ndon't be one of those parents. don't be one of those parents whose kid is permanently traumatised in their pre teen or teen years in ways that were totally avoidable", "YTA\nYour daughter is standing up for herself by asking you for help rather than suffer in silence. You have the opportunity to teach her 3 of the most valuable lessons anyone can have in life: \n\n1. Needing help doesn't make you weak. It takes courage to ask others for it. \n\n2.If you see something wrong happening to someone you should help them not just be a passive bystander. \n\n3. Everyone makes mistakes, even her dad, but what is important is that we own up to them, learn from them, and try to be better.", "YTA. Sorry, but I don\u2019t buy your Independence line. I think you\u2019re just too damn lazy to get yourself out of the house at 6:45 to take her to school.  She doesn\u2019t feel safe. It\u2019s time to be a parent and be there for her.", "I was bullied on the school bus when I was 12.

Do you want her to make a similar choice?\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYou rather let your daughter be called a \"whore\" than taking her to school where she can be safe being taken.

This is why bullying is such a difficult thing to address, in principle there are a number of different resolutions, all of which should work, but they all fall down in practice unless you're particularly lucky.\n\nThe school should be able to stop this in a hot second, but even when they recognise it's happening a proportionate response against just the bully just escalates the situation.\n\nIgnoring it should work, they're after a rise out of you, but it doesn't because they know if they push hard enough they'll get something eventually, and in a closed situation like a bus they literally have nothing else to do.\n\nFighting back should work, but a lot of the time it doesn't because you've escalated the situation to formal notice and \\_you\\_ were the one who did it, the schools hands are often tied in terms of how they respond to violence regardless of the provocation, and unless you got lucky you won't have dealt with the bullying.\n\nParental involvement should work, but often the parents or family situation is an underlying cause\u2014either the parents support their own kid, causing a backfire, or the parents fail to manage the behaviour, motivating the bully more.\n\nWhat we do know is the social group itself can stop it reliably. Bullying requires a permissive social environment, bullies can't be effective if they have an audience that will intervene. This is why work cultures can make bullying disappear if they want to, even when it seems nearly impossible for schools to do so.\n\nIn the example above, the bully is only succeeding because the rest of the bus is accepting it (if not encouraging it), and as a society we don't believe it's appropriate to collectively punish the bus for its unwillingness to intervene.\n\nThis is why I ultimately agree with people saying OP should change their position\u2014avoiding the bus avoids that grouping which is accepting the bullying, and as we have discussed the victim has no reliable options of their own to address the issue, none at least that they can put into effect at age 11. They may face a similar risk at school but the social group there is different (even if the bully is present, they can't effectively bully if the group doesn't permit it) and she may not be exposed there as a result.\n\nI also believe, in all honesty, that the way we try and address bullying through the bully (beyond ensuring that they're aware what they're doing is bullying) is a waste of time unless you can exclude them completely.

She has no power in this situation, and neither the school bus driver nor the school administration are likely to intervene without someone with power - i.e. an adult like her father - demanding action. She can't secure other means of transportation; she's too young to have friends she can ride with, or be able to ride herself. If she's picked up at 6:45, she's definitely too far from the school to walk. If the boy was inclined to stop because she asked or because she was upset, he would have \\_done so already\\_.

I'm sorry you've been through such horrible struggles for years too. Psychologists can only help so much I know from experience, even though I've done EMDR because of it. But I hope you and I can reach better times nonetheless. What I'm trying to say is, is that you're not alone with such ordeals.", "This. OP is basically telling his 11yo daughter that she needs to accept he doesn't have a problem with her being called a wh*re and she needs to learn to deal with it on her own instead of inconveniencing her parent by asking for help dealing with it", "just as upsetting is how high homicide is on that list", "I did the same for my kids.", "Same", "I was bullied a ton in school. When I was in early elementary there was a much older boy that would taunt and harass me. He\u2019d even yank out fistfuls of my hair. We weren\u2019t in a position to have my parents drive me because dad worked the early shift over an hour away and we only had one car. My parents did address it with the school and their transportation department. The bus driver made sure to keep an eye on him and far away from me. That taught me that my parents would fight battles for me that I wasn\u2019t yet able to fight. My dad taught me self defense moves if someone laid hands on me and even gave my older, very big, brother the green light to take out anyone hurting me. Don\u2019t start a fight but you won\u2019t get in trouble for finishing it. I hate the approach of \u201cjust ignore them and they\u2019ll go away.\u201d No they won\u2019t! Not doing anything only proves that the bully chose the right victim that won\u2019t fight back. My son had a couple of boys roughing him up. He\u2019s 5. I addressed it with the teacher and principal and got the boys will be boys attitude. So I showed my kid the easiest way to break someone\u2019s nose with a fast jab and told him that is only to be used if someone lays hands on you first. You\u2019ll get suspended from school for three days, bully will bleed and probably cry, his friends will all laugh at him, you walk away with your head held high saying I said don\u2019t touch me and they\u2019ll never touch you again. I told him if he was forced to defend himself he would not be in trouble at home so I\u2019ll make his suspension a fun 3 days at home. This shit kept happening and my kid is so kind and gentle. He didn\u2019t want to hit him. So mama got a little loud so to speak on social media regarding the school looking the other way when my kids face was smashed into the pavement. I immediately got contacted by the principal and 2 other women that work with his class. I\u2019ve become friends with one of them whose daughter is in his class. They\u2019re now keeping a close eye on the troublemakers (future inmates) and not allowing them to ever be unsupervised and keeping them away from my son. When kids are young they need us to teach them HOW to fight their own battles. You can\u2019t just say suck it up and deal. The way my parents handled it taught me how to fight my battles and THAT is what made me a stronger person and I always knew I could count on them anytime I needed help.", "That was my first thought---OP was a bully.   \nYTA---stand up for your daughter.", "My partner jokes a difficult situation will build character but he will not and has not sat by and done nothing when our daughter was bullied.", "This is a reach. \n\nTbh, it seems more likely OP was bullied in school and he \u201chandled it\u201d by just grinning and bearing it because his parent wouldn\u2019t step in either to intervene and that\u2019s why he\u2019s choosing to handle it this way.\n\n_I_ was bullied in school, my mom basically told me to grow up and deal with it and my instinct when reading this post was to handle it the same way he did. Unlearning that no one is there for you is hard.", "I'm 38 and I still have damage from being bullied in school. YTA, OP.", ">It doesn't make anyone stronger other than the bully\n\nIt doesn't do that either in many cases. I personally was on both sides as a young man.\n\nLots of kids become bullies to take the target off themselves. Happened this year to my son. His now former friend was getting bullied so to change the narrative he started essentially a bully my son campaign in school.\n\nShits wild, we handled it and got it stopped but I feel bad for my son because his so called best friend for the last 7 years betrayed him like that.", "In his retirement, my father was recruited by the school district to be a bus driver. He said one of the worst aspects was that there was no other adult on the bus. This was before bus monitors were common. He was always worried about watching the road and ensuring nothing bad was going on.\n\nAt some point, he instituted a policy that there had to be at least one row of separation between the high school boys and the middle school girls. Precisely b/c of this type of abuse. While it didn\u2019t stop the verbal crap, at least the boys couldn\u2019t touch the girls. \n\nWhen my father talked to the school, the response was largely \u201cboys will be boys.\u201d \n\nI heard from him that another bus driver had caught two high school kids in some sexual act on the bus. That was back in the day when the seats were higher and the view to the back very limited. \n\nParents either don\u2019t know what happens on those busses or have forgotten. \n\nI remember all the stuff that used to happen. \n\nI\u2019d not put my child on a school bus if I had another choice. \n\nChildren are cruel. They need supervision. And all it takes is one bully and one incident.", "Nah, the bully can go after groups of people. Source: i was in a group of bullied kids on the bus", "Gave me a stinky eye every now and then but no bullying!", "Yep, in my case it escalated to sexual assault.", "Thanks, this is extremely informative!", "We think bus drivers are \"special\" people or something with extra great driving skills. I had a school bus run a red light in front of me. Not a yellow. But an actual red. Just like they were tired of waiting for the light or had a *brain fart* and whoops - there's goes the bus... right through the intersection.\n\nIt was one of those times I really wished I had a video camera running and recording it all. My mouth was hanging open. I was in the car alone. I said \"What the fuck are you doing?\" out loud in the car all alone. \n\nI'm pretty sure the bus was empty... or didn't have many kids on it. I couldn't see any... but still! WTF?!", "Exactly this. My dad was like OP. I was bullied relentlessly and all I ever heard from my dad was that I just needed to ignore it it\u2019ll go away. It didn\u2019t. I was cornered in a bathroom one day and beaten pretty badly and only then did my dad wake up and realize the danger. To this day, I have self esteem issues. To this day I still try to people please because I somehow think that they\u2019ll like me more. I\u2019m 38. This dad is a massive AH. Do better.", "I mean I've learned stuff from people who treated me like shit, but this doesn't mean I don't have to do anything about it or that my friends and family won't help me. They obviously will and have done so in the past.\n\nEven more important though, I've learned stuff when I was an *adult*. Being treated like shit as a kid will NOT make you feel strong. It will most likely fuck you up. IF the parents help her deal with it, like make a complaint, talk to the parents of the other kid, make a difference, THAT would be a good lesson and good character development for the kid. That's how you stand up for yourself. OP is handling this SO badly.", "This is a trick question. People from privileged social positions often do feel strong when stuff like this happens because they can fight back without too many repercussions. \n\nIf an 11 year old boy was picking on OP when he was 11 he probably could fight back with words or fists and maybe get a slap on the wrist. If an 11 year old boy is using appearance based insults and the word whore to bully an 11 year old girl the consequences could be far more dire. \n\nOP has never been a vulnerable girl being sexually harassed by a boy in a society where victims of SA are blamed for 'provoking' it and people defend the attackers because 'boys will be boys.'", "I mean I would say telling your pre-pubescent daughter to just STFU and take the bus with a kid who calls her a whore is definitely bullying so yup, I agree with you OP identifies more with the bully than the target.\n\nThe actual option is to go speak to the school, the kid\u2019s parents and possibly the bus driver about the bullying and teach the 11 year old how you learn to stand up to people and/or problem solve.\n\nNot just go \u2018suck it up buttercup\u2019. Kids often have black and white thinking because they aren\u2019t aware yet of \u2018third options\u2019 unless they are educated on them or see them modelled. They think \u2018I can ride the bus and be bullied or ask mom for a lift\u2019 because they are 11 and not developmentally at the stage to go \u2018or could we address the root issue?\u2019\n\nAlso tweens are starting to feel a bit like they are childish to ask for help and parents have to remind them it\u2019s ok to need adult support as well as learning to solve it themselves. Kind of like you\u2019ve got your training wheels off your bike but you\u2019d ask an adult or expect an adult to check you have everything and know how to fix a tyre before you ask to cycle three miles to school everyday. It\u2019s not either or, it\u2019s progressing to next stages having mastered the first one.\n\nA lot of parents forget kids need as much guidance on this learning in tween/teen years as toddler years. Toddlers learn to walk. Teens learn how to walk in the big wide world safely. Baby gates at one stage. Bus bullies at another.\n\nYTA. I am however biased. My dad did something almost identical when I was about that age (although it was adult men sexualising me en route to school) and it was when my already rocky trust in him turned to distance. He was furious that puberty seemed to make me a brat who disrespected her dad when she\u2019d always been daddy\u2019s girl and pulled further away. We were estranged by the time I was 18. I\u2019d periodically try to reconnect but that misogyny always tripped it up.\n\nWe are so no contact for so long now I have no idea if he\u2019s alive. I can\u2019t be arsed to even set up a Google alert for his obituary. Just like he couldn\u2019t be arsed to parent me. I became VERY independent :)", "i also make that joke as sort of gallows humor, because i know most of things that are supposed to make people tougher are unnecessary and shitty, even preventable sometimes. so my friends and i will joke about every horrific thing that happens to us about it building character and then laugh ourselves into tears in our late 30s. 2023 is a wild time to be alive", "Yeah, I just kinda looked at how most of my bullies are now high level people in their work places...it seemed to give them confidence or something. At least, it seems that way to me, after everything", "Thank you for replying. Have a good one.", "Sounds like you didn't have parents that got involved and forced the issue, because she/the school obviously could have done something.", "But if the bully is willing to target this girl outside of school, then not taking the his won\u2019t solve the problem either.", "As a parent of a child who was bullied (from experience) - I followed the county guidelines with my documentation of my child's experiences and submitted it to their school. Bullying is taken seriously (when handled properly) in my county (despite my county being a laughable one). The moment you turn in that form, the school has 48 hours to investigate the incident. The bully and her parents were brought into the school and mandated to sign an agreement that if the bullying/behavior continues, a police report would be filed and they could be expelled. You know what happened? The bully was changed to another class, changed her ways, and became a better person. My daughter was never bothered by her again and made friends after that. THAT is what a parent should do.\n\nThe child should know that when they go to their parent for help, their parent is willing to put forth the effort to teach her how to stand up for herself (and following laws/guidelines/ and advocating for yourself IS also standing up for yourself). My daughter learned how to advocate for herself by watching me teach her the procedures.\n\nThe OP in this case is just a horrible, horrible father and I follow the same sentiment that OP was likely a bully in his years and is STILL a bully now. He clearly does not care about his daughters physical or emotional wellbeing. This GENUINELY infuriates me.", "Well said. I can sort of understand OP's point about wanting his daughter to learn from the experience, but saying \"you're on your own, figure it out\" usually isn't the best way to impart skills, even in a situation that's totally safe and emotionally neutral. Even less so when it comes to bullying which is likely making her miserable. Daughter needs help and support from an adult, not be to thrown to the wolves.", "Seriously! And like... most *adults* I know would struggle to deal with someone aggressive like that. Never mind that it's a boy harassing a girl, we have no idea if this kid is older and therefore bigger, and OP seems to not really care that she's likely going to have a good chunk of her life with random men harassing her. And his only response is not wanting her to \"have an easy solution\"? Fucking infuriating."]}
