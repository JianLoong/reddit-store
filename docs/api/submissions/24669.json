She seems to be the dominant force in the family, and there's hell to be paid if you don't pay attention to her rules or live up to her expectations.\n\nI suspect your husband was abused by his mom growing up. He functions more like a slave to her than a son.\n\nShe probably tells him, \"You're with her all week, 6 days.

You took her baby away, and she wants to show you she is more important than you are.\n\nWhat is your home life like??

I would focus on the way he functions in everyday life.\n\nMy oldest son, now passed,  was raised primarily by his mom. It was the summertime, and he stayed with me for a couple of weeks. We were in the car, and I asked him what he wanted to do. He shrugged his shoulders and said, \"I don't know.\" I drove around for about 15 minutes and asked him what he decided. He said, \"Mom usually tells me what we will do.\" I was stunned!!
