You can burn it if you want, you earn it. NTA", "NTA. Make a new banc account without giving her the login.", "It is so bizarre to me that parents 'monitor' their kids bank accounts.  I know that a parent has to be on the account until 18 or whatever. but why do that have to access it and see what the money is being used for. Especially if its money you earned from working. When i opened an account at that age and my parents had to be on the account they never once looked at it again, if i had questions i would ask for their help but they never went to the bank to see what i was doing(pre internet). its weird to me.\n\nNow having said that, Maybe she is upset that, since christmas is coming, she was going to make that purchase as a big gift for OP. Thats the only reason i could see her being this upset. Beside dad was with OP when he made the purchase, so maybe she is just overly controlling.  \n\nOP is clearly NTA for spending his own money that he earned.", "NTA your money your decision.", "Nta\nWhere I live my mom lost acces to my account when I turned 16. Maybe its the same where you live?", "Your mom is more of a child than you are", "You asked, \"what do I do?\"\n\nI'm sorry that you are left with that question and that your mom is a horrible communicator.\n\nIt doesn't sound like your mom takes any money; she just monitors your spending in an obnoxious way. Annoying, but better than her taking money.\n\nDid she/your dad ever discuss any expectations about your account with you? Like, you need to save to help pay for a car or your college living expenses? or a certain percent of what you earn? Or that you can't make purchases that affect the house? (e.g., While our daughter could spend her money on things like clothes, food, make-up, portable music speakers, camera... we initially did not allow her to buy an Alexis because we didn't want that thing listening to us all the time. We did allow it later.) Be sure you are respecting any long-term savings goals/ guidelines like that, that they have discussed with you.\n\nDo your parents generally live pretty frugally? I'm not excusing the way your mom handles this, but could it be hard for your mom to see you spend money on fun luxuries when they are struggling to cover family expenses? That doesn't change your right to spend your own money, but it is something to be sensitive to. It sounds like you spend about 10% of your savings on this purchase - understand that is a relatively big amount to spend.\n\nAs far as your mom griping/giving you the silent treatment about your purchases, that is not normal or mature behavior. That is not your job to manage. Your dad took you to get the oculus, so you know he was OK with your purchase. Does he ignore how your mom behaves, or does he call her on it? Does he speak up for you? He should be. If he doesn't, then you just go about your normal business. Let your mom do what she's going to do without you trying to placate her or 'fix it' for her. As you get older, that technique is going to be very helpful for you.", "It's time to start withdrawing money, and paying in cash.", "NTA. It's your money and you should be allowed to spend it. You might talk to your dad about changing accounts so that he is on it and not your mother.", "YTA. Oculus sucks. I'd be disappointed if my kid bought something lame too.\n\nYou could have got a Steamdeck with that money. You bought a shitty, inferior system.

Like a... warped training in \"I pretend they've already left\"?", "NTA.  It\u2019s your money.  And at 16, I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect you to pay anything towards the home.  You might want to try waiting a day before any big purchases tho.  Just a good habit to get into.  As soon as you\u2019re able, get an account under your name only.  I hope she isn\u2019t taking any money for the account.  Good luck!!  And what is an oculus?   lol.  I gotta look that up!"]}
