You have severely undermined the teacher  and I suspect that she needed to shut it down quickly in front of the whole class so they all knew it was unacceptable.

E.g being a parent and contacting the school yourself about concerns. I can promise you that that teacher probably feels super inadequate to do their job because someone doesn't like their style of teaching.

I had to take a year off for medical reasons.  You had a day to day sub because it was cheaper than hiring a someone temporary.    Don\u2019t push your guilt off on to me.

Pretty sure that teacher is going to treat your daughter like crap for the rest of the semester/school year.

Even then they have to be able to justify it to the school. Trust me, life would be so much easier for teachers if they could.\n\nSome teachers have teaching styles that just don't mesh with the group they are teaching (some are just terrible). You could have requested a student transfer if it is clearly hurting your student's grades but a school usually will not switch out a teacher.

I agree with your points in principle, if those things really happened, but we don\u2019t even know what really happened, only what a 14 year old told her mom, and mom\u2019s reaction (which was prettier immature, she should have taken her concerns to the teacher, not had her 14 year old daughter enlist the whole class against the teacher and blindside her). Having been a 14 year old girl once, I know how dramatic we can be.
