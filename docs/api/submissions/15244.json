If the teaching style is inappropriate then you, as the supposed adult, have a conversation with the teacher regarding your daughter\u2019s learning. Teaching positions are not decided by popularity contests run by students. You have severely undermined the teacher  and I suspect that she needed to shut it down quickly in front of the whole class so they all knew it was unacceptable. You created a public situation by involving other kids, so you can\u2019t now complain that the teacher gave a public demonstration of the behaviour that is not going to be tolerated in a classroom.

E.g being a parent and contacting the school yourself about concerns. I can promise you that that teacher probably feels super inadequate to do their job because someone doesn't like their style of teaching.

Even if there was a legitimate reason why this teacher should not teach this class (I don't believe there is, but it could happen), then it is not your kid's job to do something, but yours.

That's why OP's husband is correct - a school is not a democracy.\n* Only if talking to the teacher didn't work, OP should have escalated this by speaking to the principal.\n* OP encouraged her daughter to involve more people (her classmates) in this off-process complaint. More people always means more drama, which is contrary to what she says in other comments here. By publicly escalating the complaint immediately like this, the teacher probably sees OP / her daughter as threatening their career / livelihood, or at the very least, making the job of teaching that class much harder.\n\nWhat would you think if a colleague was unhappy about an aspect of your work? Would you rather they tell you in private and give you a chance to talk and work something out, or would you rather they wrote a list of why they thought you were bad and tried to get your whole team to sign it?\n\nOP has misread the situation here and made a mistake - that's fine, it happens. Everyone makes mistakes in their interactions with other people. But they should accept the YTA judgement and make things right with their daughter and the teacher - primarily for the sake of her daughter.", "You are right. This was for OP.", "Lmao. I am occasionally like \"this is what happens when people skip the humanities\" when I run across this type of social unawareness.", "That's the funniest thing I ever heard while being so accurate.", "Looool.

Would it change anything about your work environment? Would you be the correct person to address those concerns to?\n\nIf all the other members were literally children and my job on the team was to make sure they understand what we work on and can succeed in the future then that would sting a bit but I would take the criticism sincerely.

It's a government office that's even more rigid than an office environment.", "There\u2019s no perfect analogy. The analogy is actually not as bad  as the truth, because the teacher needs to have authority in a classroom as well and OP\u2019s move undermines it."]}
