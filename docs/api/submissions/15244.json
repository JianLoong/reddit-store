Instead you send your daughter on a little crusade to collect signatures to, essentially fire the teacher from this specific class? \n\n  \nThere is no way you are not the AH in this OP. While the way the teacher handled this matter wasn't good, what you did was just horrible.", "YTA: because you suggested your daughter did it. Why did you suggest your daughter rally the troops about something so important rather than actually parenting and phoning the school to raise your concerns like anyone else would. She\u2019s a kid.", "YTA. School resources are not divided by popular vote.", "YTA. You are a parent and your job is to prepare your child for the real world. And the reality is that not everyone enjoys the same things and just because they don't like one teacher doesn't mean that the teacher is bad at their job, or that they can't learn something from a different way of doing things.\n\nAs you describe it the teachers reaction is not good, but it's not super clear what teacher/school staff was being communicated with and I'm not sure given your involvement here that you are a fair reporter of their response.\n\nSchools work with the staff they have. A student led petition is going to do nothing but create tension and problems. What kind of outcome you were anticipating I cannot fathom. It's immature.", "YTA for encouraging your daughter to undermine her teacher by mobilising her classmates into a campaign. If the teaching style is \u2018different\u2019 but appropriate, then your daughter will adjust. If the teaching style is inappropriate then you, as the supposed adult, have a conversation with the teacher regarding your daughter\u2019s learning. Teaching positions are not decided by popularity contests run by students. You have severely undermined the teacher  and I suspect that she needed to shut it down quickly in front of the whole class so they all knew it was unacceptable. You created a public situation by involving other kids, so you can\u2019t now complain that the teacher gave a public demonstration of the behaviour that is not going to be tolerated in a classroom. Not \u2018liking\u2019 a teacher is absolutely not an acceptable reason to complain unless they are being unprofessional or not doing their job. You are the parent that teachers cannot stand.", "Wow YTA.

I could imagine you would feel very embarrassed and self conscious. In fact you might even be inclined to quit working for them all together because who wants to feel like they suck at their job?\n\nAs for the teacher, they shouldn't have humiliated your daughter and threatened a suspension. But, maybe that was a knee jerk reaction to try and protect themself from being thoroughly embarrassed by their entire class. \n\nThere are much better (and more adult) ways of going about this. E.g being a parent and contacting the school yourself about concerns. I can promise you that that teacher probably feels super inadequate to do their job because someone doesn't like their style of teaching. This could have a been a prime opportunity for you to teach your daughter that sometimes we have to work and learn with people who have different styles and so we need to learn to adjust.", "YTA, and way to make your daughter the scape goat!

But let\u2019s say it is, how can any adult think *starting a petition* is an appropriate way to handle a class not liking a teacher? The whole situation is on you being a crappy parent. \n\nIf there were actual complaints, you as the parent should\u2019ve communicated, and you should\u2019ve done so *with the teacher in question* first. But seeing as all you\u2018ve got is the kids don\u2019t like the style, eighth-graders are old enough to understand that\u2019s how the real world works. There will always be people they like more or less than others. That\u2019s nothing you solve by going behind their backs and riling up people against them.", "YTA- I think you should\u2019ve talked to the teacher directly instead of making your daughter do so", "I don\u2019t agree with the teachers actions here, no one should be humiliated, but I\u2019m going to with YTA on this one. \n\nI\u2019m confused as to why you thought this would be effective or even appropriate? Why did you not handle this yourself and why did you put it all on your daughter instead? March your ass to the school and talk to the principal and whoever else to bring your concerns to. Even the actual teacher!\n\nAlso, just because some classmates take a vote doesn\u2019t mean that changes everything? Wtf lol I really don\u2019t understand why you thought that\u2019s how any of this works but you need to get your butt down to the school yourself and sort this out.

I'm sorry your precious angel doesn't like how this new teacher teaches but she needs to get over it. congratulations you just made your daughter's 8th grade year turn out to suck becsuer of this the teacher is going to be harder on your daughter. all teachers teach different but you don't get to tell the teacher you need to change your teaching because my daughter doesn't like it. the entitlement", "YTA. Firstly, you're the AH to your daughter: instead of acting like a parent and talking to the school about your concerns, you put your daughter in the firing line. Secondly, instead of teaching your daughter to advocate for herself and speak to the teacher, you essentially encouraged her to get an 'army' to push the teacher out. Utterly ridiculous.", "YTA you convinced your daughter to start a petition to get her teacher fired? Well yeah, there\u2019s going to be backlash, that\u2019s a person\u2019s livelihood!!!", "Your husband is right. It sounds like there wasn\u2019t a problem, just a dislike in the new teaching style. Unfortunately, that\u2019s how it works. Your daughter needs to learn to adjust. YTA.", "Wow, YTA. This is a discussion for you to have - if not with the teacher, then her department chair, the principal. You absolutely put your daughter in the crosshairs, maybe because you are afraid of confrontation? All you\u2019ve done is teach your daughter that her mother has poor judgment and doesn\u2019t mind the humiliation of her child. Grow up, you\u2019re the adult here.", "Yta.", "YTA. Your daughter is a child and you made her handle an adult problem. If there was a problem with the teacher then YOU as the parent need to handle it.", "ESH except your daughter. You now need to apologise to the school for not following the appropriate grievance procedure, and explain that your daughter did not initiate this, so you can repair your daughters reputation.\n\nCoaching your daughter on how to deal with difficult personalities will help her in her adulthood. She's not going to succeed in a career of she models the behaviour you demonstrate", "Going around collecting signatures on a complaint letter isn't a 'polite' way of talking to someone. It's a formal protest.  \n\nYTA. You put your kid in this teachers cross hairs when you could have sent an email.", "YTA, what if someone at your husband's work started a petition to replace him? How would you feel about that? Your bad advice humiliated your daughter.", "YTA, how could any competent adult not see that this was a ridiculous idea?", "Wow. I can't wrap my head around the fact that you thought this was a good idea! Part of growing up is learning to deal with people you don't like and powering through until you can get out of the situation. As in the end of the school year. I made my daughter deal with a teacher who seemed to have an issue with her. It went really well. Obviously, I would have gotten involved if needed, but it wasn't. I had gone over  what to say etc. My daughter thanked me years later for teaching her how to deal with things like that as it was a huge help to her in college and at work.", "YTA\nI do not think parents (or kids) should get to dictate who teaches whom. I am convinced that being taught by different people in different styles is beneficial for the development of skills (social and otherwise), even if you sometimes don't like a style very much. (Often you just have to adjust.)\n\nBut. Even if there was a legitimate reason why this teacher should not teach this class (I don't believe there is, but it could happen), then it is not your kid's job to do something, but yours. You're the parent. You can try to have a talk to the teacher in question or with the class teacher, you can get other parents involved, but YOU have to to that, not your child.", "way to f up someones schoolfuture", "ESH  - except your daughter\n\nIf you had a problem with your daughter's teacher or wanted to advocate on behalf of your child, you should have done so yourself rather than trying to rabble-rouse the students. You could have set up a meeting with the teacher or principal to discuss your concerns with an aim for better classroom outcomes for the kids as opposed to getting rid of the teacher. Who knows, you might have found out that 8th graders are wrong and the teacher had reasons for her teaching methods and is doing a good job.\n\nThe teacher should not have humiliated your daughter.", "NTA you were trying to teach your kid how to question status quo and influence change, if things had gone by plan they would have had a discussion with the class teacher, but they didn\u2019t. The lesson here is well, those in power will do everything in their power to stay in power\u2026. So now go be an adult and have a meeting with the principal, the teacher, and the class teacher.

Demand that they apologize to your child in front of the class (they embarrassed your kid publicly, they must apologize publicly). Demand oversight of the teacher to prevent further retaliation.", "ESH sounds like you handled this wrong. Teachers reaction was unprofessional as well.", "NTA - the teacher is a bully.
