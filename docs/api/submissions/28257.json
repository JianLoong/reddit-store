Out of \"everyone in the office\" who are okay with the cold temperatures, how many of these people are men?

Your office temperature is at the low end of this range, and might even dip below it, due to the fans you mention.  Beatrice is an asshole, but it's somewhat sexist to frame her as a nagging, irrational woman when she has a valid complaint that is an issue for many women across many workplaces.  \n\nFinally, your Hooters comment was wildly inappropriate.  If your only issue was only related to temperature, why not say something like \"don't dress like you're at the beach\"?  Why bring up her lack of a bra at all?  That has nothing to do with her being cold.  Stop looking at your coworker's boobs and turn the temperature up a few degrees.", "I was with you, but I\u2019m sorry but slut shaming someone is never the answer. I\u2019m a fat chick, and I would have issues with what she said too. She was being an annoying ass busy body, which is reasonable to point out. And it\u2019s reasonable to point out that covering up mire would help. But slut shaming? Really?? I think we have to get out of this space where we feel entitled to use any insult towards people we label \u201cbad\u201d because of their bad-ness, when said insults play on patriarchal/white supremecist/whatever bullshit. Fat jokes, slut shaming, racist slurs, ableist language is bad *always*, no matter who it\u2019s directed at. Because those things are never what\u2019s actually bad about that person. Your coworker\u2019s not an asshole because they wear lowcut shirts, they\u2019re an asshole because they negatively commented on your body. \n\nLike if I was a coworker near by when this altercation went on, I\u2019d be equally aghast at what each if you said. Like, obvs Beatrice was out of line, but when I heard your hooters comment I\u2019d file it away in the back of my mind that you were an asshole too.
