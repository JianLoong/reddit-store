Out of \"everyone in the office\" who are okay with the cold temperatures, how many of these people are men?  I would encourage you to check out the following links:\n\n[https://www.pfizer.com/news/articles/cold\\_wars\\_why\\_women\\_feel\\_the\\_chill\\_more](https://www.pfizer.com/news/articles/cold_wars_why_women_feel_the_chill_more)\n\n[https://www.latimes.com/health/la-he-office-temperature-women-men-study-20190529-story.html#:\\~:text=The%20findings%3A%20Women%20performed%20better,better%20at%20temperatures%20below%2070](https://www.latimes.com/health/la-he-office-temperature-women-men-study-20190529-story.html#:~:text=The%20findings%3A%20Women%20performed%20better,better%20at%20temperatures%20below%2070).\n\nThe latter article cites a study saying women generally work better at a temperature between 70 and 80 degrees.  Your office temperature is at the low end of this range, and might even dip below it, due to the fans you mention.  Beatrice is an asshole, but it's somewhat sexist to frame her as a nagging, irrational woman when she has a valid complaint that is an issue for many women across many workplaces.\n\nFinally, your Hooters comment was wildly inappropriate.  If your only issue was only related to temperature, why not say something like \"don't dress like you're at the beach\"?  Why bring up her lack of a bra at all?  That has nothing to do with her being cold.  Stop looking at your coworker's boobs and turn the temperature up a few degrees.\n\nEDIT: Everyone is responding with the very good point that it is simply easier to put layers on than take them off.  I think I will rescind my suggestion that OP turn up the temperature a few degrees.  It was meant to be  tongue in cheek, but yeah, Beatrice could just put a cardigan on (although OP could take her own cardigan off...).  I think my overall point about OP's lack of awareness of this being a common issue for women, and lack of empathy, still stands.  And damn, maybe Beatrice's hands are cold or something.", "I was with you, but I\u2019m sorry but slut shaming someone is never the answer. I\u2019m a fat chick, and I would have issues with what she said too. She was being an annoying ass busy body, which is reasonable to point out. And it\u2019s reasonable to point out that covering up mire would help. But slut shaming? Really?? I think we have to get out of this space where we feel entitled to use any insult towards people we label \u201cbad\u201d because of their bad-ness, when said insults play on patriarchal/white supremecist/whatever bullshit. Fat jokes, slut shaming, racist slurs, ableist language is bad *always*, no matter who it\u2019s directed at. Because those things are never what\u2019s actually bad about that person. Your coworker\u2019s not an asshole because they wear lowcut shirts, they\u2019re an asshole because they negatively commented on your body. \n\nLike if I was a coworker near by when this altercation went on, I\u2019d be equally aghast at what each if you said. Like, obvs Beatrice was out of line, but when I heard your hooters comment I\u2019d file it away in the back of my mind that you were an asshole too.

Now, if we design for 70 degrees F and they want to keep it at 78, we can have an issue with the equipment being oversized (particularly if it's a DX system without reheat). But if we design it for 73 and they keep it at 75, there shouldn't be an issue. Most people I know design for somewhere between 73 and 75. All this to say, a lot of the responsibility for taking into account your workforce demographic falls on the person who has control of the thermostat. Just because it's designed for 73 degrees doesn't mean they can't turn the temp up a degree or 2.", "You're right they have studied this but you're wrong on the why women run colder. \n\nWomen have a **slower metabolism** over all. \n\nWomen have less muscle mass. \n\nWomen have a higher percentage of body fat.   \n\nOf course there are outliers and I get there are really fat dudes but on average a obese man will have more muscle than a really obese woman.

This is also why trans men generally sweat so much more on hrt, that's an effect of testosterone.\n\nalso just in an anecdotal sense I haven't met one person on estrogen based HRT that doesn't notice they sweat less & seem colder all the time, or one person on testosterone based HRT that doesn't notice sweating more & feeling hot all the time. Unfortunately because of a lack of research on trans people we must look to other trans people for advice.

High estrogen levels are linked with feeling cold in general.\n\nFeminizing HRT suppresses testosterone and increases estrogen levels. It is generally supposed to mirror the hormone levels of cis women. It leads to a loss of muscle mass, fat redistribution and higher percentage of body fat, lower metabolic rate and even thinner skin. \n\nSo all the factors that lead to cis women experiencing temperature differently change with feminizing HRT (I'm ignoring menopause here because that would get too complicated).", "I didn't say there is no data.

No. \n\nThat doesn't change the fact that the factors that determine how women perceive temperature are generally the same in trans women on HRT and cis women.

And being overweight can cause disability through other conditions, in which case it could be covered essentially by proxy within the disability claim. But being overweight on its own is not necessarily a disability. To be covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act you have to meet the statutory definition of a disability, which for purposes of the ADA, is an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity (I\u2019m paraphrasing here, but you can look up the exact language if you want). So the actual impairment element still needs to be met. So obesity can definitely substantially limit you in major life activities, but it doesn\u2019t always do so. If someone is overweight but otherwise able to function, they aren\u2019t an individual with a disability covered by the ADA. \n\nWhere this can get pretty broad is the definition of \u201cmajor life activity\u201d. Eating is a major life activity. So an eating disorder could qualify as a disability, but it might not depending on the severity and symptoms. Walking is a major life activity, so if your weight directly affects your mobility, that would be covered. But even then, it\u2019s arguable whether \u201cobesity\u201d would be the disability, or the actual physical impairment it\u2019s causing, like, say if your weight wore down all the cartilage in your knees or something, that problem with your knees is what makes it difficult to walk, so that would be the more proximate condition to call the disability. \n\nIt\u2019s possible there\u2019s some cases out there where obesity alone could be a disability, I haven\u2019t seen that personally, but there are a lot of cases out there. Because that is not an impairment in and of itself, but it\u2019s closely tied to a number of impairments.\n\nEdit: I just looked and it does seem like there are a few cases where courts have said obesity alone is a potential disability. So it could depend a lot on what district/circuit OP lives in, but the majority of federal courts at least are still on the side of obesity only being a disability with an underlying health condition.", "It could be! It would depend a lot on info we don\u2019t have. It\u2019s not clear to me from the post the severity of the eating disorder, whether it was diagnosed, or how substantially it has limited OP\u2019s life activities. That said, if the weight is just a \u201clittle extra\u201d as OP said, it\u2019s also hard to determine with certainty that their actual weight is a direct result of their eating disorder. But it\u2019s certainly possible.\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act doesn\u2019t actually give a list of conditions that are or are not disabilities. It depends on the individual and how the condition affects their life. So you\u2019d have to know a lot more about OP\u2019s eating disorder, and then essentially look for cases where judges have said that similar disorders with similar levels of impact on their functioning either are or are not covered under the ADA.", "I thought Australia, but the Fahrenheit threw me.", "I'm thinking based on OP using the term Jumpers that they're not from the US.", "At my workplace, we would handle the weight comment as making the workplace toxic but OP's comment if reported would be a mandatory write up for sexual harassment as it is covered under federal/provincial laws despite the other person starting it", "Turtle necks or straight to jail", "I feel this so hard.

Work clothes can be entirely appropriate but still be called out on a trans persons body if there is a little extra space in some places, which is generally considered better than too tight. To an extent, unless you got really lucky with your body shape/proportions you\u2019re going to have some stuff slightly misalign. Being trans in the workplace is essentially being told you need to go back in the closet because your clothing doesn\u2019t fit like it would on a cis body. To me that smacks of transphobia more so than concern for workplace suitability. Harass someone about there clothes regularly, insult their eating disorder recovery (which imo should be covered under other disabilities and health conditions in protection from workplace harassment, especially since comments like this can cause fucking death!), and yeah I think some snippy words about one\u2019s own attire in return to indicate a misogynistic monster \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\n\nAnd wtf is with everyone using \u201cthey\u201d for OP?
