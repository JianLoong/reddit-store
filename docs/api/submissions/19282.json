In our case I do the laundry, trashbags, most of the cat related tasks (litterbox, food, drinking water mostly fall on to me like 80/20), I vacuum daily during the week because the cleaner only comes on friday and we have long haired cats. My wife does the smaller food groceries for stuff like dinner, the cooking most of the week, grooming of the cats once or twice a week, and does yard work twice a year.\n\nNow this 50/50 split is important to me, because I don\u2019t want either of us to feel used by the other, or make either feel like we\u2019re lazy.\n\nSo last saturday we\u2019ve been lazing about playing the new Legend of Zelda. We have an appointment in the evening at 6:30. I did the laundry in the mean time while my wife continued playing Zelda, I took a shower, went down and asked how late we\u2019re going to eat because we\u2019re supposed to be somewhere in 1.5 hours. I said \u201cprobably best to eat at 5:30 since we\u2019re supposed to be there and there an hour later\u201d. Mind you this was an appointment at an event organized by one of her friends. She said she wanted to grab a shower as well and that we weren\u2019t going to make 5:30, and told me \u201cthere\u2019s instructions on the packaging so you can do it as well, otherwise we\u2019re not going to make it\u201d.\n\nThat didn\u2019t sit right with me because she wasn\u2019t doing anything today except playing a game, and due to her own poor planning I was supposed to fix dinner as well. So I told her no. She told me \u201cthe instructions are clear I\u2019m sure you can do it\u201d. I told her \u201cit\u2019s not that I can\u2019t do it, but I don\u2019t want to do it.

You're not a slave to that man! I think you two could communicate better about this issue, it sounds like you have different standards of cleanliness which you've already addressed by getting a cleaner. Maybe with the dinner thing you can assign a couple of days a week to each of you, then have one day where you just get takeout/go out so nobody has to cook?

From your added context, sounds like you pick up more of the slack, and there was no reason for her not to make dinner if that was a clear expectation she knew there was of her.

Meal planning, cleaning produce, cutting, shopping for it. Maybe you guys should switch up some duties and trade places once a month. Actually on the weekends one of us makes the main dish and the other does side dish(es). Cleanup in kitchen is a shared task, which is a daily thing and I notice isn't on the task list you have. Maybe your wife needed a day off from any chores at all. I know a few couples where the wife does the daily cooking (meaning she gets off work and is working immediately in the kitchen) and the husband does ALL the weekend meals. I could be wrong, but I feel that you are underestimating meal responsibility and possibly padding yours with cat duties. I would rather do cat duties than meals 7 days a week. Maybe you should each do your own laundry (that works very well in my house).", "NTA, you were both having a lazy day. Your chores were done, hers weren't. Up to her to get them done.

Who does dishes?  Who mops the non carpet parts of the house? Who cleans the bathroom?  Who dusts?  Who does the large grocery trips since you specifically call her grocery chore small?\n\nYou also seem to lumping her chores together while splitting yours.  For example- she does 'smaller food groceries' for dinner.  So she inventories what you have, makes a grocery list, goes shopping, puts all the food away, plans the meals, and cooks dinner?  \n\nWhereas for the cat chores, you didn't just say 'cat chores', you listed each thing to make it look like more.", "YTA\n\nFor starters, I'm not convinced you are as 50/50 as you think. Cooking takes a very large chunk of time every day. I do the same tasks you do in my home AND I try to do others to make up for my partner cooking and they only do that for me maybe half of the week. AND she does grocery shopping? AND cat grooming? It sounds like she has a number of routine, time-intensive tasks. If she's comfortable with the division, that's okay, but I don't see how you have cause to feel slighted here.\n\nBeyond that, some days things won't line up right. Especially if you have plans. She made a mistake with her time management, but mistakes like that are normal. As her partner, you should be supportive at those times, not a vindictive auditor. You also could have nudged her given you had plans. That's normal, too. Not doing that DOES feel like you set her up to fail.", "YTA stop keeping score.  Your edit makes it seem pretty clear that you have a higher requirement for cleanliness (e.g. daily vacuuming, cat or no, indicates clean freak behavior).  This suggests quite strongly that your wife is not lazy, you're just not taking responsibility for your own desires.\n\nTo put it another way.  Splitting chores 50/50 is normally fine, clean once a week trade off each week, do your own laundry, cook 3 times a week each and trade off the 7th day every other week, whoever cooks, the other does the dishes etc.  Do the less regular chores as a team. Obviously you can split these up in a different fashion or format however you like.  However, once you begin adding additional tasks to the list, raising the bar, they're not chores.  You'd be better off describing them as hobbies, because that's what they are.  Optional activities you undertake because you either enjoy them or enjoy the end result of them.  We don't expect our partners to share in the work aspects of our hobbies unless they also share the hobby.\n\nThus YTA, you have a hobby: cleaning your house more than necessary.  You don't like a specific instance where your partner does not wish to interrupt her hobby to do a minor chore.  You overreact and attempt to justify her as lazy and portray your hobby as a burden she is not fairly carrying, ergo YTA.", "ESH If she knew she was expected to make dinner she should have planned for that. I can understand being annoyed. But, if she\u2019s normally good about keeping up with her end of things, I would\u2019ve just stepped in so we could be on time. Maybe make a trade off where you cook while she showers and next week she scoops the litter box or something. You need a little flexibility", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And yoh don\u2019t say she\u2019s this rigid about sharing tasks with you. So she probably also picks up the slack when you are sick, otherwise you would have made sure to tell us she doesn\u2019t. You have very rigid and unhealthy views which makes you an AH.", "Still does not make you look better", "Your edit does not help. You also just aren't listing some chores or lumping her chores together while splitting yours.  For example- she does 'food stuff' for dinner.  So she inventories what you have, makes a grocery list, goes shopping, puts all the food away, plans the meals, and cooks dinner.\n\nWhereas for the cat chores, you didn't just say 'cat chores', you listed each thing. \n\nMissing- dishes, cleaning kitching, dusting, cleaning bathroom, and mopping floor (unless your kitchen is carpeted?)", "You\u2019re still a scorekeeper. It doesn\u2019t matter that you edited to add details about what the score is, scorekeeping is an absolute shit thing to do in a marriage.", "Info: And if you\u2019re ill etc? Does she pick up \u201cthe slack\u201d?", "Just add an edit in the post if  this not the first instance. And has happened several times in the past which led u to snap.", "You aren\u2019t getting the concept of relationships. It\u2019s not a business deal. True love is when you derive joy in their happiness! \n\nYou could have done it and next day brought it up nicely.  That\u2019s the way but my guess is you are young so you will learn in time. I used to be like you but I learnt it hard way that in long run \u201cbeing right\u201d isn\u2019t important in relationships, \u201cdoing right things\u201d is.", "Manipulation her into doing what you want. There is also the fact that your behaviour caused the 2 of you to be late which is extremely rude to the people you were meeting. \nI will never understand why the people in a household don't just do what needs to be done around the house instead of nitpicking who does what", "Yes and my judgement is still firmly YTA", "You never mentioned dishes and general straightening, changing bedding, etc. How are you dividing those tasks? I ask because straightening and dishes are more time consuming tasks, similar to shopping. Who does weekly lawn mowing also? Trying to get a clear view here.", "Neither of them were obligated to do anything that day, they could've both just skipped one day of chores (with the exception of cat stuff) and kept playing till they had to leave. I'm focusing on her because he is the one making this post attacking her. It's not procrastination, its enjoying a new game that came out and relaxing for a single day.", "Yeah I'm glad to see the mental load being listed. Even if you're choosing nuggets, you're still CHOOSING. Food decisions are a whole thing and while those chores might on paper seem small the microdecisions accumulate. \n\nYou both had a chill day. Some balls got dropped. It wasn't your friend, so?", "I much prefer cooking to doing laundry, TBH. Cooking is a lot more fun.", "Yes, it does. The edit shows that this situation came about because OPs wife would routinely neglect her chores out of laziness. This is just the straw that broke the camels back.", "So much this. Reddit has a knack for blaming men for not doing enough housework, even when they do most of the housework. It's extremely demoralizing.", "Lastly I didn\u2019t say you were an AH. I am just stating my opinion on your situation.  Watch the Tim Ferris interview with Brene Brown. I posted YouTube link.", "I provided more context in the OP.", "We have a dishwasher, but since she cooks I do the dishes. Which is mostly rinsing and putting them in the dishwasher. Changing bedding is usually done by me, but also by her. Folding is also done by me. She said she likes doing the ironing (which I think is straightening?), so we agreed that I put it at a certain spot she can check. I think the last time she ironed was 3 to 4 months ago. We have a yard mostly comprised of stone so no lawn mowing needed.", "Then you are NTA."]}
