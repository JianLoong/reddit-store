In our case I do the laundry, trashbags, most of the cat related tasks (litterbox, food, drinking water mostly fall on to me like 80/20), I vacuum daily during the week because the cleaner only comes on friday and we have long haired cats. My wife does the smaller food groceries for stuff like dinner, the cooking most of the week, grooming of the cats once or twice a week, and does yard work twice a year.\n\nNow this 50/50 split is important to me, because I don\u2019t want either of us to feel used by the other, or make either feel like we\u2019re lazy.\n\nSo last saturday we\u2019ve been lazing about playing the new Legend of Zelda. We have an appointment in the evening at 6:30. I did the laundry in the mean time while my wife continued playing Zelda, I took a shower, went down and asked how late we\u2019re going to eat because we\u2019re supposed to be somewhere in 1.5 hours. I said \u201cprobably best to eat at 5:30 since we\u2019re supposed to be there and there an hour later\u201d. Mind you this was an appointment at an event organized by one of her friends. She said she wanted to grab a shower as well and that we weren\u2019t going to make 5:30, and told me \u201cthere\u2019s instructions on the packaging so you can do it as well, otherwise we\u2019re not going to make it\u201d.\n\nThat didn\u2019t sit right with me because she wasn\u2019t doing anything today except playing a game, and due to her own poor planning I was supposed to fix dinner as well. So I told her no. She told me \u201cthe instructions are clear I\u2019m sure you can do it\u201d. I told her \u201cit\u2019s not that I can\u2019t do it, but I don\u2019t want to do it.

You're not a slave to that man! I think you two could communicate better about this issue, it sounds like you have different standards of cleanliness which you've already addressed by getting a cleaner. Maybe with the dinner thing you can assign a couple of days a week to each of you, then have one day where you just get takeout/go out so nobody has to cook?

From your added context, sounds like you pick up more of the slack, and there was no reason for her not to make dinner if that was a clear expectation she knew there was of her. But also, just cook the damn meal and then have a normal conversation about it later rather than being awkward. You sound like you have some resentment towards the fact that you pick up more household stuff - you should address that properly not wait until you're both snarky.", "Marriages aren't 50/50. Sometimes they're 20/80, sometimes they're 10/90, sometimes they're 45/55. She spent the day relaxing and playing a good video game, something I'm sure she doesn't get to do very often.

Meal planning, cleaning produce, cutting, shopping for it. Maybe you guys should switch up some duties and trade places once a month. Actually on the weekends one of us makes the main dish and the other does side dish(es). Cleanup in kitchen is a shared task, which is a daily thing and I notice isn't on the task list you have. Maybe your wife needed a day off from any chores at all. I know a few couples where the wife does the daily cooking (meaning she gets off work and is working immediately in the kitchen) and the husband does ALL the weekend meals. I could be wrong, but I feel that you are underestimating meal responsibility and possibly padding yours with cat duties. I would rather do cat duties than meals 7 days a week. Maybe you should each do your own laundry (that works very well in my house).", "NTA, you were both having a lazy day. Your chores were done, hers weren't. Up to her to get them done.

Who does dishes?  Who mops the non carpet parts of the house? Who cleans the bathroom?  Who dusts?  Who does the large grocery trips since you specifically call her grocery chore small?\n\nYou also seem to lumping her chores together while splitting yours.  For example- she does 'smaller food groceries' for dinner.  So she inventories what you have, makes a grocery list, goes shopping, puts all the food away, plans the meals, and cooks dinner?  \n\nWhereas for the cat chores, you didn't just say 'cat chores', you listed each thing to make it look like more.", "YTA\n\nFor starters, I'm not convinced you are as 50/50 as you think. Cooking takes a very large chunk of time every day. I do the same tasks you do in my home AND I try to do others to make up for my partner cooking and they only do that for me maybe half of the week. AND she does grocery shopping? AND cat grooming? It sounds like she has a number of routine, time-intensive tasks. If she's comfortable with the division, that's okay, but I don't see how you have cause to feel slighted here.\n\nBeyond that, some days things won't line up right. Especially if you have plans. She made a mistake with her time management, but mistakes like that are normal. As her partner, you should be supportive at those times, not a vindictive auditor. You also could have nudged her given you had plans. That's normal, too. Not doing that DOES feel like you set her up to fail.", "YTA stop keeping score.  Your edit makes it seem pretty clear that you have a higher requirement for cleanliness (e.g. daily vacuuming, cat or no, indicates clean freak behavior).  This suggests quite strongly that your wife is not lazy, you're just not taking responsibility for your own desires.\n\nTo put it another way.  Splitting chores 50/50 is normally fine, clean once a week trade off each week, do your own laundry, cook 3 times a week each and trade off the 7th day every other week, whoever cooks, the other does the dishes etc.  Do the less regular chores as a team. Obviously you can split these up in a different fashion or format however you like.  However, once you begin adding additional tasks to the list, raising the bar, they're not chores.  You'd be better off describing them as hobbies, because that's what they are.  Optional activities you undertake because you either enjoy them or enjoy the end result of them.  We don't expect our partners to share in the work aspects of our hobbies unless they also share the hobby.\n\nThus YTA, you have a hobby: cleaning your house more than necessary.  You don't like a specific instance where your partner does not wish to interrupt her hobby to do a minor chore.  You overreact and attempt to justify her as lazy and portray your hobby as a burden she is not fairly carrying, ergo YTA.", "ESH If she knew she was expected to make dinner she should have planned for that. I can understand being annoyed. But, if she\u2019s normally good about keeping up with her end of things, I would\u2019ve just stepped in so we could be on time. Maybe make a trade off where you cook while she showers and next week she scoops the litter box or something. You need a little flexibility", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Both of you sounded equally lazy all day. I assume you just went up to flip the laundry during Zelda, unless you mean you sat and stared at the washer & did \u201cdedicated laundry time\u201d for hours? Like, this sounds like you went upstairs for 15 minutes to flip laundry and shower; if that\u2019s the case, she probably wouldn\u2019t have had time to make dinner regardless. \n\nBut honestly, outside of this specific circumstance, you\u2019d be the asshole for your stance on chores. I\u2019m not usually one to nitpick chores, but your entire post is about nitpicking chores, so here we go. By your own admission, your household has a _very_ rigid 50/50 split. But then you also say that you do more and the chores are split \u201cin her favor.\u201d And _then_ we look at your chore list, and it\u2019s \u201c_trashbags_, laundry, vacuuming, and 80% of daily pet duty not including grooming\u201d so\u2026 50% of pet duty? I find that \u201c80%\u201d exceptionally ironic; you have no problem with her doing 20% of daily pet care, _your_ chore, yet you hold such a rigid 0% cooking policy. Your daily chore load is what, 5 minutes? 10 minutes? She does the daily cooking (at least 30 minutes there), grocery shopping, the other half of the pet care, and \u201cyard work twice a year.\u201d I\u2019m very intrigued as to what sort of yard work only needs to be done twice a year, but that\u2019s besides the point. You also have a weekly cleaner, so neither of you are doing the heavy lifting (and don\u2019t house cleaners usually do trash? makes your \u201ctrashbag\u201d chore make more sense). And finally, you don\u2019t account for all of the other daily chores (dishes, counter wipe downs, household management, tidying, etc), so I\u2019m left to assume your wife picks up the slack there. \n\nI don\u2019t know man. For all of your insistence that you do _exactly half but also more,_ it really doesn\u2019t sound like it. You do \u201cpet care\u201d but then admit that she does half of it. You do \u201ctrash bags\u201d, not \u201ctrash\u201d, which leads me to assume your house cleaners handle most of your trash. You do laundry for two people, so a handful of loads a week. On a daily basis, you vacuum and _usually_ feed the cat, while your wife is making dinner and handling all of the daily kitchen chores, at minimum, due to the aforementioned unlisted daily chores. \n\nI just\u2026. how can you go around with a vacuum and partial pet duty as your only daily chores, look at your wife cooking dinner every night, and think the daily chores are equal? How can you pop in a load of laundry & replace the trash bags, look at your wife doing the grocery shopping and twice-weekly pet grooming, and think that the weekly chores are equal? All of your chores are easy, brainless tasks that only take a few minutes and are rarely considered time-sensitive. Her chores are mainly dinner-related, but that requires planning & forethought & a significant amount of daily work.
