For a living, I work at a grocery store. Once Halloween ended, the store kicked in the Christmas music on November 1st. The first week of non-stop Christmas music was fine. Once the third week came, I had become exhausted from the repetitive music. For all of November, it was the same 30 songs. It got old FAST. I was invited to my sister's house on Thanksgiving, in which they also blasted Christmas music all day long, I didn't complain about it, I dealt with it.\n\nDuring Thanksgiving dinner, we all established that we would all meet up at my house for my birthday party. We had set the party to start at 4 PM. Come November 27th, my birthday, I was getting hyped for a night that I thought i'd enjoy. Come 4:00 and everyone arrives, 14 people in total. Once everyone was inside, my sister started fiddling with my stereo. Worried she might do the deed, I quickly ran up to her and said \"whatever you do, don't put on Christmas music\". She froze in her tracks and slowly tilted her head in my direction. She stood there frozen and starts squinting her eyes as if I just did an unholy sin. She very slowly lifts her fingers away from the tuning knob on my stereo and walks away.\n\nI figured since my stereo was already turned on, i'd put on some regular 70s and 80s pop and rock music that I like. Once I turned the volume up, a few people started staring at me wondering what was going on. My brother came up to me and said \"where's your Christmas cheer?\", I said in joking manner \"Sorry, I left half of it in the back seat of my Buick Century\". He chuckled and let it go.\n\n45 minutes later, my sister yells out \"Attention everyone, Attention! I know this party's dull, so i'm gonna crank up the Christmas music!\", I heard a few cheer her on, and before I could do anything about it, Christmas music started blaring out of the stereo. I covered my ears and I pulled the plug. My sister said \"Wtf, we're trying to party here and you're being such a Debbie Downer.\" Everyone was staring. I stated that I simply couldn't take anymore Christmas music as my workplace had been playing it non-stop since November 1st.\n\nMy sister said \"Oh please, you're such a Grinch\". She plugged the stereo back in, and the Christmas music resumed. I instantly got my keys and a few other things, got in my car and left for a hotel. My family was blowing up my phone wondering where I had gone to. I texted back saying I had to leave as it was too much for me. Some understood, and some were annoyed. My sister was especially angry. She said she had thrown an entire party for nothing, and didn't know what to do with the cake. I stated to her that I didn't want the Christmas music at my birthday party and she cut me off saying\"uh, no you don't, the world doesn't revolve around you, mister. You need to give and take a little.\" I was simply tired of it so I just hung up.\n\nAITA for ditching my own birthday party over Christmas music?", "created_utc": 1701152733, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/185ph6e/aita_for_leaving_my_birthday_party_after_my/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your sister (and family) can't respect that then let them celebrate Christmas early on your birthday without you. They were being rude and selfish. Someone's birthday isn't a day where it's majority rule. The day should focus on making the person whose birthday it is happy. Obviously there are limits to that, but the person being celebrated not wanting music that will make them miserable played shouldn't be one of them.\n\nPlus, it's a whole change of focus for the party. It's a birthday, not a Christmas party. Putting on that music when you don't want it is like signalling the end of your birthday party and the start of a general Christmas party.", "NTA\n\nIt's your birthday.

Other than that, Christmas runs from Christmas Eve to Epiphany, to accommodate both Western and Eastern Christmas.\n\nAnd a suitable greeting is \"Happy Mid-Winter Holiday of your Choice\" if you don't know what a person's chosen mid-winter holiday is.
