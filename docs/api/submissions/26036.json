However, we have recently been arguing because my boyfriend thinks it's unfair that I only cook vegetarian food. \n\nIt started a few weeks ago, when he made a disgusted face at the food I'd cooked. I asked why, and he said that he was tired of eating vegetables. He said I should start making food with meat in.\n\nI told him that he could cook his own food, but he refused. His reasoning is that he works more hours than me, so I should be doing the cooking.\n\nI somewhat agree, but I don't think I should have to cook two separate meals. He's angry at me still, but I just don't think it's fair. Yes, I work less hours; but I still work.

It's unfair and unreasonable of him to expect you to cook meals for him that you won't be eating.

But, partnering up with a Vegan means that you'll certainly be sacrificing a large part of your diet at dinner time, because *even* if you are to cook dinner, you're going to have to cook something vegan to serve the other person, or cook two separate meals.\n\nYes, there are meals that you can make where the meat is a side rather than the main event, but sometimes you just want to make something easy like a steak, chips and a side salad. Without the meat, that's a shit meal lol. If I was the vegan in the relationship I wouldn't be super stoked with a salad and chips for tea either.\n\nLong term I don't see how this works out for people.

The blatant chauvinism here is just making my skin crawl. If he\u2019s not willing to cook, then he\u2019s not welcome to complain about what\u2019s served. Full stop.

You gave him an option for having meat with his dinner, he's refused that. As long as you aren't preventing him from eating meat (which your suggestion makes clear you aren't) at home or out, then it is his decision.

Unless you are preparing his breakfast and lunch too, I'm going to presume he does.\n* Does he cook for you on his non-working days? Or are you expected to cook on weekends and holidays?\n* Would you be agreeable to putting in the oven a meal which has been pre-prepped (by your boyfriend) and frozen, so he can have his meat whilst you enjoy a vegan meal? I am asking because a) it removes the onus to cook two meals and b) it clarifies your position in only cooking vegan food.", "NTA But may I suggest making meals that are easy to costumize? So that you can split them into 2 parts: One without meat and the other that he can easy add meat to (since you don't want to handle cooking meat).\n\nIt won't take as long as it is to make 2 seperate meals, or even one new meal from scratch.", "NTA\n\nYou don't eat, you don't have to cook it. He can meal prep a bunch of meat on his day off and add it to what you've prepared. Heck he can even get large orders from a restaurant and have it to add to his plate.\n\nSide eyeing the age diff and wondering if he's showing any of the other classic signs of controlling behaviour. Are you able to spend time with your friends and family, without him there? \n\nDo you have a separate bank account? And are you in control of your own money?  Who does the chores at home?", "NTA. My wife is a domestic engineer and when she needed to change her diet for medical reasons, my diet changed to match because:\n\n1. There's no way I'm going to even **ask** her to make two separate meals (to say nothing of *expecting* her to do it).\n\n2. I wanted to support her and not force her to watch me eat things she enjoys but that she can't eat anymore.\n\nExpecting you to make two different meals is arrogant; justifying the expectation with \"you work less than I do\" is demeaning.

Keep cooking what you like and want.", "NTA  I agree with the others that he needs to grow up and do for himself. However, I also think if you are wanting this relationship to last long-term, you may want to consider meeting him part way. Would it really hurt to occasionally cook him a piece of meat (separately) to go along with whatever else you are making?

He's still eating. His needs are being met, assuming the meals are nutritionally balanced and he's getting protein from other sources. He just *wants* to eat more meat, as a treat.

You'd probably both be happier if you parted and found more like minded partners.", "I going to assume that the work/chore/financial split is currently working for both of you.  If it isn\u2019t then the question is about chores not the food.\n\nBut if one of your contributions to the household is cooking then only cooking food without meat seems unreasonable.

It doesn\u2019t make sense for both people to cook for the same meal.\n\nSo I guess YTA for not at least sometimes providing a meat option.", "NTA  Make a deal where you cook only what you want to and he pays only the bills he wants to.

He can damn well cook his own food-or drive thru McChicken if he wants the meats.", "Quick compromise: He works longer hours but most meat (for a single serving) will not take long to cook at all.

Is he actually paying more or do you just have a better work/life balance?  Because if he's at a job earning money that isn't going to joint purposes he's enriching himself while you tend to him.
