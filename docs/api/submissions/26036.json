However, we have recently been arguing because my boyfriend thinks it's unfair that I only cook vegetarian food. \n\nIt started a few weeks ago, when he made a disgusted face at the food I'd cooked. I asked why, and he said that he was tired of eating vegetables. He said I should start making food with meat in.\n\nI told him that he could cook his own food, but he refused. His reasoning is that he works more hours than me, so I should be doing the cooking.\n\nI somewhat agree, but I don't think I should have to cook two separate meals. He's angry at me still, but I just don't think it's fair. Yes, I work less hours; but I still work.

It's unfair and unreasonable of him to expect you to cook meals for him that you won't be eating.

But, partnering up with a Vegan means that you'll certainly be sacrificing a large part of your diet at dinner time, because *even* if you are to cook dinner, you're going to have to cook something vegan to serve the other person, or cook two separate meals.\n\nYes, there are meals that you can make where the meat is a side rather than the main event, but sometimes you just want to make something easy like a steak, chips and a side salad. Without the meat, that's a shit meal lol.

As long as you aren't preventing him from eating meat (which your suggestion makes clear you aren't) at home or out, then it is his decision.

Unless you are preparing his breakfast and lunch too, I'm going to presume he does.\n* Does he cook for you on his non-working days? Or are you expected to cook on weekends and holidays?\n* Would you be agreeable to putting in the oven a meal which has been pre-prepped (by your boyfriend) and frozen, so he can have his meat whilst you enjoy a vegan meal? I am asking because a) it removes the onus to cook two meals and b) it clarifies your position in only cooking vegan food.", "NTA But may I suggest making meals that are easy to costumize?

He can meal prep a bunch of meat on his day off and add it to what you've prepared. Heck he can even get large orders from a restaurant and have it to add to his plate.\n\nSide eyeing the age diff and wondering if he's showing any of the other classic signs of controlling behaviour. Are you able to spend time with your friends and family, without him there? \n\nDo you have a separate bank account? And are you in control of your own money?  Who does the chores at home?", "NTA. My wife is a domestic engineer and when she needed to change her diet for medical reasons, my diet changed to match because:\n\n1.

Keep cooking what you like and want.", "NTA  I agree with the others that he needs to grow up and do for himself. However, I also think if you are wanting this relationship to last long-term, you may want to consider meeting him part way.

If it isn\u2019t then the question is about chores not the food.\n\nBut if one of your contributions to the household is cooking then only cooking food without meat seems unreasonable.

He can damn well cook his own food-or drive thru McChicken if he wants the meats.", "Quick compromise: He works longer hours but most meat (for a single serving) will not take long to cook at all.

It takes less than 10 minutes to cook a steak or a chicken breast to add to her cooking, and there are even relatively inexpensive and extremely accessible pre-cooked options he could use like microwavable chicken/steak strips, etc.", "I would say it depends on why your a vegetarian.  If you are one for moral reasons I'd disagree as a vegetarian that they would be nta.\n\nIf they are not a vegetarian for moral reasons, well fck yta.\n\nTo force someone to go against their morals is a major red flag and I'd say dump em as they don't respect you.", "She said in a comment \u201cfor moral reasons I don\u2019t like handling or cooking meat\u201d", "I disagree. Perfectly acceptable to her to shop for meat deals, lay it out to thaw... but if she doesn't want to cook two separate meals (which is a pain in the rear!) He need to step it up and make it himself. She can't simply just not put meat on her plate - she doesn't want it touching her food she's within her bounds to completely refuse.\n\nHowever.. it would be nice of her to throw a piece of chicken in a frier and lay it out for him. Or he can buy his own pre cooked meat and stop being a little weiner.", "Why are you assuming that she's cooking the same food over and over and yet his meat food wouldn't be the same food over and over?", "What.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

HE could cook some different proteins on the weejend, and add them to his portion!", "Yes, he can absolutely do that. For himself.", "Yes, same here to say this. He could easily prep meat on Sunday and add it to whatever OP he made.", "Yep,.super easy for the boyfriend to do this.", "Shoot, he doesn't even have to cook the meat himself, you can buy all kinds of ready made meat dishes at the grocer, from beef pot roast, to pulled pork, and shredded or grilled chicken. All the effort he would have to make is a few additions to the grocery list.", "My grocery store makes these glazed chicken breasts that are super convenient and easy to cook.", "Just a lazy one sometimes.\n\nSome nights after a long ass day I don't want to make cooking a whole thing. Steak, salad, chips. Easy.\n\nIt also means for going some meals which I love that don't translate into a viable vegan option. I love lasagne. I love taking the time to do it right by slow cooking the ragoo, making sauce from scratch from tomatoes I have grown etc. I'm not a bad cook by any stretch, but if I had a vegan in my life that would be the end of lasagne. \n\nIt's just better not to be romantically involved with one. It is a major compatibility issue for me, and based on OP post, it sounds like it might be for them too.\n\nAlso, some people are just bad cooks lol. Doesn't make them bad people. *If* they are a bad cook, then that kind of proves my compatibility point don't you think? It's not really the gotcha that you think it is.", "Then she can do other things than be forced to handle and cook meat when it makes her feel sick. She can trade some other chore for him being responsible for cooking his meat.", "You shouldn't have to.", "Noted. That's an entirely fine choice and a reasonable set of boundaries that should be respected.\n\nThis one is on him. He's got near limitless ways to satisfy his own food requirements. If he refuses, then he's inviting his own problems rather than seeking solutions.\n\nCan you be present in the same room meat is being prepared? Can you two turn this into a group effort to satisfy everybody every once and awhile? Do you have an air fryer? Team work makes the dream work and all that.\n\nI'm a single dude who lives alone. I cook. So, I've not got a lot of sympathy for Mr. Cook Meat For Me Woman. I get he's working longer hours, and I see that you respect that, but assigning exclusive responsibility to any one task set in a relationship is no bueno. That's where resentments grow.", "This is helpful information.   To me, this is not an issue of \"how to share household responsibilities\", so much as a \"how do you even keep a relationship\" question, which includes \"how do you communicate\" and \"how do you listen to, respect, and support your partner.\"  It's not solved by the internet voting \"NTA\" (though that's my formal vote), but what you really want to know is not AITA but HDWFT (How do we fix this?).  You need to talk.  You need to explain, if you haven't, just how you feel about cooking meat, both the \"Ik\" feelings and the moral objections.And then you listen to his responses.  If your bf doesn't want to even have this discussion, or does but doesn't listen, or dismisses your concerns, or gaslights you or otherwise shows no interest in any reasonable compromise, then I suggest you seriously consider getting out of the relationship.  Rigidity, gaslighting, and narcissism should be deal-breakers, because these traits are going to affect many other issues down the line.  How are you going to resolve things down the road if you want kids and he doesn't or if you want to buy a house, and he wants to rent, etc.?\n\nAt a minimum, you should insist on joint counseling, or just go yourself if he refuses (although that refusal would also be a deal-breaker, in my view).\n\nFYI.  I've been married 35 years.  Before I retired, we both worked.  My wife did all the meal planning, most of the food shopping, and all of the cooking.  Since I retired I do almost all of all three tasks.  It's a lot, even for a retired person.  I now feel pretty ashamed that I didn't share more of the meal planning and cooking before.", "Truth. But compromise. There has to be compromise on both ends....in some way. If your not willing to compromise, then you're not willing to live with anyone but yourself. Which inherently negates any cohabitation relationship at all. Which is where this couple seems to be. The compromise has to come from both ends in some way, or it just won't work.", "I was completely on your side until I saw this comment.\n\nAlso, while six years isn't that much of an age difference, I'm a little concerned that a 25 year old man started dating a teenager, and now he's telling you what you \"should\" be doing based on his work schedule. Watch out for other red flags and take care of yourself.", "My point is that she should cook a chicken breast on the side to add in to whatever is being made some of the time.  Like if her job in the household is preparing meals then only preparing her preference is unreasonable.", "But if she was a vegetarian for moral reasons or objected to the practice of cooking meat it would have been in the post.  If added later it\u2019s untrustworthy.  So we should judge the OP for her stated reason which was not wanting to do extra work rather than speculate on if she has ethical issues with cooking meat.  I do agree with you that we\u2019re it the case that this was a moral issue then she\u2019d likely not be the asshole.", "It's so easy I suspect that what he really wants is for OP to start making meat-based dishes. I personally think that if you get into a relationship with a vegetarian/vegan who doesn't cook with meat, you need to accept that if you want meat you'll be cooking it yourself. And I say this as someone who eats quite a lot of meat.", "Lazy indeed.", "Exactly so if that\u2019s the case she is the asshole for not reworking the chore arrangement when she can reasonably fufill one of the tasks.", "For sure.", "Vegetarianism is often practiced for ethical or even religious reasons, which I would say is more than just a preference. If he wants her to violate her own ethics because he doesn't like eating vegetables, that seems more unreasonable than her cooking a balanced vegetarian diet that they can both eat and that he is free to supplement for himself if he's insistent on having meat.", "Sometimes people are human beings and imperfect and don't think about every single little thing that redditors are going to nitpick.", "In a different comment, OP says that she almost always cooks vegan. As an omnivore, I think it's fine if you don't want to make meat, but mostly vegan is very, very different than mostly vegetarian.", " I swear to god lmao. Man needs to just like, cook.", "She did not mention ethical reasons for not being able to cook meat.  If that were an issue it should have been included in the post and then it would be considered.  There is no reason to add that in her favour when she is the OP.  Her reason is not wanting to cook two meals.  \n\nEssentially people are saying he either has to have the household chore of cooking or he has to be a vegetarian for dinners.  That\u2019s seems like an unreasonable choice.  If she is cooking because that makes sense for them then cooking meals that both enjoy is part of that task.\n\nIt\u2019s like if cleaning the bathroom was your take and you have his and hers sinks.  But then because you don\u2019t use one of the sinks you don\u2019t clean it because why should you have to clean two sinks.", "The reason a person won\u2019t cook meat is not a nitpick.  Its also not like she didn\u2019t provide a reason.  She did. So why don\u2019t we listen to the one she provided.  She doesn\u2019t want to cook two meals.\n\nShe also might have missed the Doctor recommending the husband to eat more protein and that animal sources would be better so to their concentration.  We can make up all kinds of things if we want toz", "I don\u2019t disagree that mostly vegan is very different from mostly vegetarian, but I think the point still stands that if you get into a relationship with a vegan or vegetarian, you need to accept that if you want meat then you\u2019ll be cooking it yourself.", "Lol, it's not like that at all, actually. She's making plenty of food for both of them; he's just being a baby about eating vegetables and not having meat, even though he is perfectly free to buy and make it for himself. \n\nWhen cooking for a household, you always cook for whoever has the most restrictive diet, regardless of the restrictions or reasons for them. As long as she's providing balanced meals that they both should be able to enjoy and get enough sustenance, she's fulfilling her obligation to the household.", "Keep picking those nits.", "In the bath room argument she wouldn\u2019t have to use the second sink.  \n\nIt isn\u2019t reasonable that he is now a vegetarian unless he cooks.  It doesn\u2019t make sense for a household to have two people cooking the same meal.  It\u2019s a waste of labour.\n\nWhy is it unreasonable that she dry up a chicken breast while cooking the rest of the meal?"]}
