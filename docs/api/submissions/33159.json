Out of what funds are you purchasing the computer?\n\nAlso, your other two kids are now about the same age your daughter was when she got the fancy computer. Do they also have fancy computers? Are they getting fancy computers as gifts this year? If not, why the difference in treatment between your daughter and your sons?", "Although I understand why you went and did the things you did, I will still say YTA. There are too many variables here that I don't know nor understand.  \n\nFirst of all, why would a 15 year old need a new MacBook? If the broken one worked just fine but with a cracked screen, the daughter could have used and waited to get a new one. If you wanted to get her a computer to use because the other one is broken, why didn't you just get her a cheaper one that works fine for school? That way if it was somehow broken again, it wouldn't be a huge loss. \n\nWhy was there no talk about the kid who broke her old computer? From my experience, no kid would purposely throw another kid's backpack unless there's a reason for it. So not knowing what happened or discussing the situation with the kid's parents is weird to me. \n\nAlso, why did you go behind your wife's back? Yes, she disagreed with you but you claim that you were already going to do it before you had the discussion. So why didn't you spend more time discussing your and your wife's POV on things with each other? I believe that you should have waited until you both came to some sort of agreement. Your wife didn't completely reject the idea of getting her a new MacBook, just not at the moment and maybe in a year or so which I find is reasonable. However, I don't know the true story behind it, since all you provided was that she thought it was a learned lesson. Of course, I don't know what lesson that would be, but it seemed that you didn't discuss enough to find out what your wife thought that lesson is.\n\nNot only that, you took your daughter out to buy the MacBook which showed her that you're the good guy and you would buy your sweet baby anything no matter what.

What's the point in using them?", "But that's more expensive and you get less out of it, assuming normal use situations. The only benefit is assuming the kid will break it because the $1700 one will holdup far better.", "Yeah, but they don't have one for EVERY student to use at once. Plus if you do graphic design, art etc.. or anything simillar you will want to store you stuff to edit and work on later, or to have access to your documents to work on in the libary or whatever. My work has desktops available but i get to bring in a laptop that is better if i want to, and if my coworker broke it id be pissed. Just because you choose to bring in your own reasorces doesnt mean you're to blame if a third party breaks it. \n\nAn analogy: I can get the bus wherever but i choose to drive, if someone rams my car am i at fault for not using a service available to everyone??", "In my California school district every child starting in middle school gets an assigned  chromebook.

The chrome books are so junky, slow, and indestructible, BUT we're grateful. \nOur kids will need to use a personal PC soon because it will be nearly impossible to do excellerated work on those things.

I would never have left a MacBook lying around in a backpack at school because that isn\u2019t taking very good care of it. Maybe mum had told her not to take it to school or to leave it in a locker outside of class or to put a better case on it and she didnt. There are tonnes of reasons why mum might have thought there was context to it that you don\u2019t know about. Also she wouldn\u2019t have died from not having a brand new MacBook immediately.", "You state she doesn\u2019t bother with the chrome books, so it could be assumed everyone at school has some kind of device in their backpack, if that assumption is correct the kid really should have known better.", "Why wasn\u2019t it in some sort of protective sleeve?

Those can be quite expensive as well, and *everybody* puts them at every day, casual risk. What about cars, which are *much* more expensive?

In addition to that, their book bags have a laptop \u201cdivider\u201d where your laptop is meant to go and there\u2019s cushion in that pocket area. When they picked out their book bags that was nonnegotiable. The sleeves aren\u2019t so thick to where they can\u2019t fit into their book bag, and they can also use it to protect their laptops when they aren\u2019t using their book bags.

Spilling milk and letting it mold, filling it with lube, letting layers of grease/dandruff build up, or lighting it on fire etc\u2026 definitely not okay lol", "Right, kids sometimes break stuff, kids have younger siblings who sometimes get into their bookbags, some kids have rough home lives and don't have a safe/clean place to do their homework, etc etc etc. It seems like making kids pay for the broken supplies would punish kids who can't afford it the most.", "I don't think OPs family is strapped for cash. Most people aren't buying their kid the newest Mac book at 13", "Damn, I missed the fun. I\u2019d love to know what the comment was.", "Yeah that's not how fast electronics devalue mate.", "You mean kids will be kids? So jaded.", "Try telling me the same thing after looking up statistics on violence surrounding fraternities. \n\nBut also, the same thing should apply to what I said about phones, right? Every country has some sort of crime rate, so do you feel the same about ppl who bring their phones with them? If someone out in public ripped your phone out of your hands and threw it on the ground, are you going to blame them for their behavior or are you going to blame yourself?", "macbook pro 14 = \u00a31,699.00 on the apple UK website, which is $2155 USD.\n\nsame thing = $1,599.00 on the apple USA website, which is 1260 GBP.\n\nso you are patently incorrect.", "Kids get bullied and other kids break their stuff, but no one believes them. It's really just... life. Also like what if they just don't have the money? What if the parent refuses to give them any and the 9 year old or whatever doesn't have any? What if the family just does not have that money? Does the kid just keep getting punished?\n\nAlso, cheap technology just wears out and chromebooks are kinda cheap. My old laptop, I broke a key on it from normal use. It cracked right down the middle - who's to decide if it was my \"fault\" or not?", "The school can also give them personal Chromebooks, they are allowed to take them home. And the child would be responsible for paying for a damaged one in their care.", "This is a literal false equivalence lol", "I don\u2019t remember the exact comment, but he was very angry. Called someone a moron. In another comment, he called someone a bigot for saying that Americans are litigious.", "You clearly just don't know anything about the subject. It's okay, no one can know everything. But it's wrong to pretend you do when you don't. Maybe, just maybe, this is something I've worked with personally and professionally? Maybe, just maybe, I don't like to spout off unsupported opinions so I double checked with some basic research before I said anything? Maybe you should try doing that, rather than sit here and argue against verifiable facts. Jesus man you're on the internet, tab over and Google before you say dumb stuff.", "especially not Macbooks!", "Fair enough. I\u2019m still wondering why you don\u2019t cover the Mac Book and iPads. Seems careless, especially if they bring them to school.", "> And before anyone pulls that spoiled kid bs their phones are 2 years old.\n\nTwo years isn't that old.", "TWO WHOLE YEARS OLD?! \n\nHaha dude wake the hell up. I have a Galaxy S7 from about 2014. Phones every two years is spoiled as hell, especially for young kids. Wild to give your twelve year old a phone at all.", "Almost all of the random and unnecessarily destructive shit I\u2019ve seen in schools were done by or instigated by boys. Girls definitely do it too sometimes, but I\u2019ve had MULTIPLE teenage boys snap my classroom rulers and pencils in half just for funsies. Saying kids will be kids is ignoring the fact that some kids (*boys*) are more likely to feel entitled to do stuff like this AND get away with it.", "Good Lord you're being intentionally dense. I never blamed them for having their laptop broke , nor did I claim nothing bad happens in colleges. \n\nIt's simply a matter of risk. The risk of a high schooler doing something immature and causing unintentional harm is higher than a college student doing the same. \n\nDoing something that is more risky doesn't shift fault to you. Even without it becoming your fault, it still benefits you to think about the risks involved and whether or not that's worth the reward to you and if so, what you can do to potentially mitigate the risks. \n\nCruising through life ignoring risk entirely because you wouldn't be at fault if something bad happened is idiotic.", "\u2026you completely and utterly did not read and missed the point, or you\u2019re just arguing for the sake of arguing. Either way, I\u2019m done here. \ud83d\udc4c", "Yikes! Cheers dude.", "Macbooks do hold their value better than the other brands out there but I do agree with Mike.\n\nhttps://techparasol.com/macbook-depreciation/\n\nIts just a link and its different everywhere but at the same time it does lose value once parts have been replaced due to damage(if you are honest when you sell it).\n\nJust my two cents. If 1750$ doesnt hurt their finances a lot then I would do the same thing.", "You're very smug aren't you? I know my stuff, thank you very much."]}
