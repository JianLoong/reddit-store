Out of what funds are you purchasing the computer?\n\nAlso, your other two kids are now about the same age your daughter was when she got the fancy computer. Do they also have fancy computers? Are they getting fancy computers as gifts this year? If not, why the difference in treatment between your daughter and your sons?", "Although I understand why you went and did the things you did, I will still say YTA. There are too many variables here that I don't know nor understand.  \nFirst of all, why would a 15 year old need a new MacBook? If the broken one worked just fine but with a cracked screen, the daughter could have used and waited to get a new one. If you wanted to get her a computer to use because the other one is broken, why didn't you just get her a cheaper one that works fine for school? That way if it was somehow broken again, it wouldn't be a huge loss. \nWhy was there no talk about the kid who broke her old computer? From my experience, no kid would purposely throw another kid's backpack unless there's a reason for it. So not knowing what happened or discussing the situation with the kid's parents is weird to me. \nAlso, why did you go behind your wife's back? Yes, she disagreed with you but you claim that you were already going to do it before you had the discussion. So why didn't you spend more time discussing your and your wife's POV on things with each other? I believe that you should have waited until you both came to some sort of agreement. Your wife didn't completely reject the idea of getting her a new MacBook, just not at the moment and maybe in a year or so which I find is reasonable. However, I don't know the true story behind it, since all you provided was that she thought it was a learned lesson. Of course, I don't know what lesson that would be, but it seemed that you didn't discuss enough to find out what your wife thought that lesson is.\nNot only that, you took your daughter out to buy the MacBook which showed her that you're the good guy and you would buy your sweet baby anything no matter what.

And then students get punished for not being able to use a broken laptop. They don't work. What's the point in using them?", "But that's more expensive and you get less out of it, assuming normal use situations. The only benefit is assuming the kid will break it because the $1700 one will holdup far better.", "Yeah, but they don't have one for EVERY student to use at once. Plus if you do graphic design, art etc.. or anything simillar you will want to store you stuff to edit and work on later, or to have access to your documents to work on in the libary or whatever. My work has desktops available but i get to bring in a laptop that is better if i want to, and if my coworker broke it id be pissed. Just because you choose to bring in your own reasorces doesnt mean you're to blame if a third party breaks it. \n\nAn analogy: I can get the bus wherever but i choose to drive, if someone rams my car am i at fault for not using a service available to everyone??", "In my California school district every child starting in middle school gets an assigned  chromebook.

The chrome books are so junky, slow, and indestructible, BUT we're grateful. \nOur kids will need to use a personal PC soon because it will be nearly impossible to do excellerated work on those things.

If she had antagonised him and he lashed out and knocked her bag off a desk then that\u2019s very different to someone randomly grabbing your bag and throwing it across a room. I would never have left a MacBook lying around in a backpack at school because that isn\u2019t taking very good care of it. Maybe mum had told her not to take it to school or to leave it in a locker outside of class or to put a better case on it and she didnt. There are tonnes of reasons why mum might have thought there was context to it that you don\u2019t know about. Also she wouldn\u2019t have died from not having a brand new MacBook immediately.", "You state she doesn\u2019t bother with the chrome books, so it could be assumed everyone at school has some kind of device in their backpack, if that assumption is correct the kid really should have known better.", "Why wasn\u2019t it in some sort of protective sleeve? I\u2019ve dropped my much heavier laptop a few times in the bag with more force than rolling it off some bleachers and it\u2019s never smashed anything as it\u2019s protected by falls from its bag? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for replacing it it was broken due to circumstances outside of your daughters control but talking to your wife more extensively and actually showing where you\u2019re coming from and that you hear what she\u2019s saying would go a long way, as would an appropriate bag for it to live in if she takes it to school again.", "I work for a public school district in IT and the amount of damaged Chromebooks we get is insane.

There is no provocation clause in personal responsibility that says if you are a jerk that makes it OK to throw and destroy your shit.", "Being a parent now, I have a lot of frustration that society pretty much expects us to have kids starting carrying around stupidly expensive devices starting in middle school and well, kids aren't any less prone to making stupid decisions or having stupid accidents than they were in the 1980s or 1990s.\n\nWhen my kid got to middle school, I learned that like my middle school in the 1980s they weren't allowed to use the office phone to call home if they missed the bus. BUT unlike my middle school in the 1980s, there is no longer a bank of payphones easily accessible for them to use instead because they're \"expected\" to have their own cell phone.\n\nI learned this because the first time the band director held the entire class after, thus making all those kids miss their buses home, my kid didn't have a cell phone to call me and was told by the office to \"find another student\" and borrow their phone to call me.\n\nAs far as I know, the various pieces of personal tech (mainly phones) which have been broken in his friends' group in middle school/high school ... none of the breakages were related to decisions to actually harm the phone itself. They were all related to pranks or stupid decisions to mess with someone's backpack, things of that nature.\n\nIf a kid intentionally and directly broke a piece of technology, that's when I'd expect that kid/their parents to participate in paying for repair or replacement.\n\nWhen something breaks because of other stupid teenager decisions that harmed it as a side effect, unfortunately, that's just a risk of the modern world.", "Oh, and my kid was in 9th grade when our district introduced school Chromebooks. \n\nI feel SO SORRY for the parents whose elementary kids are being required to haul those Chromebooks on the bus to-and-from school every day now.

If it WAS an accident he would be an AH for asking for payment. But the kid purposefully threw someone else's belongings. He is old enough to be held accountable. He is 15, not 5. All he has learned is he can do whatever the heck he wants with zero consequences. Making him have to pay it back is a good consequence. Mind you, I said the teen, not the parents. Figure out what a reasonable payment plan would be for a teen working part time then let him pay it over time so the parents are not punished, the kid is.

I agree with you.", ">I advised that she not put an expensive possession at every day, casual risk.\n\nTo be honest, that argument doesn't make a lot of sense. What about when she's in a university that doesn't supply students with laptops and she has to bring her own? What about phones? Those can be quite expensive as well, and *everybody* puts them at every day, casual risk. What about cars, which are *much* more expensive? Those are put at risk every time you drive, which for a lot of ppl is nearly every day.
