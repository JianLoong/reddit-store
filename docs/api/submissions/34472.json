About a month ago, my brother (17M) broke his arm and needed surgery, leading to a checklist from the doctor that included using a pull-up bar for his therapy at home. Here's where the family drama kicks in.\n\nQuick background: I've had serious privacy issues with my mother and brother throughout my life. They would frequently enter my room, mess with my things, and essentially claim ownership of my belongings without my consent. To combat this, I decided to install a lock on my closet door, where I store valuables like Halloween candy, exercise equipment, and various hobbies. They don't even need half the things in my room. They enter mainly because of boredom, and this resulted in my 1200 dollar telescope's focuser being broken because my brother was fiddling with it.\n\nNow, when my mother discovered the pull-up bar was recommended for my brother's therapy, she demanded access to my locked closet. When I refused, explaining the lock was precisely to prevent such intrusions, the situation escalated. She argued that my brother needed it, while I stood my ground, insisting it wasn't happening due to their history of not respecting my boundaries.\n\nLater that day, the conflict intensified as my mother returned, again demanding access. I held firm, stating it was their fault for the lock in the first place. This led to a family argument, with my father supporting my perspective, while my mother and brother accused me of being selfish and claimed families should work together. I CLAIMED THAT FAMILIES SHOULD WORK TOGETHER AS WELL, but it's just my mother and brother who make this so difficult, and I said some things that would have been better just not being spoken.\n\nThis went back and forth for like a week, and I was planning to stay firm where I stood. But the more I thought about it, the more I thought about whether I was in the wrong or not.\n\nI've kept these emotions from everyone else, and to have them bottled up like that for so long makes it very difficult to not speak out loud. I'm just tired of all of this and want to hear what others have to say. So, AITA for not allowing my injured brother to use my pull-up bar, given the privacy issues and the lock I installed for my own sense of security? The action in question is my refusal to grant access to the pull-up bar, which might make me seem selfish, especially considering my brother's injury and therapy needs. I genuinely feel torn and could use some outside opinions.\n\nEdit for context: Yes, the bar was purchased as a gift from my father for my birthday, is drilled, glued into place and used daily. No, I cannot move or adjust the bars height due to it being glued and drilled. Additionally, I've allowed my brother into my closet in the past for \"needing something\" but that resulted in the telescope's focuser breaking", "created_utc": 1704548992, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1900doj/aita_for_not_allowing_my_injured_brother_to_use/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
