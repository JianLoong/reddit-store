Every weekday morning when I take my six year old to school we leave twenty minutes early and grab breakfast on the way to school. I use this time to talk to him about whatever he wants to talk about (the Owl House, he wants to talk about the Owl House) because we are so busy at home and don't always have time to chat whenever he wants. Then I go to work and after work I pick him up from his after school program.\n\nOur six year old has to go to the after school program because his school ends before my work. His program ends at five thirty, but I usually get there around five fifteen. The program allows for early pickup, but my son doesn't like leaving early, so I usually wait for him, or I swing by the store and pick stuff up before getting him. All this amounts to an \"extra\" thirty-five(ish) minutes of me out of the house five days a week, so about two and a half hours a week.\n\nMy wife said she is getting frustrated by this. She said I'm slacking. I'm not slacking. I'm spending time with our kid or running errands. It's not a huge chunk of time, but it's important that he doesn't feel like he's being forgotten because of the babies.\n\nShe wants me to leave in time to get him to school and me to work on time, but no earlier, and to pick our son up at five fifteen instead of five thirty. I think that's silly. Those twenty minutes don't make a difference. It's not like I leave in the middle of feeding the toddler. She's always changed, fed, dressed and in her playpen when I leave. I don't just run off with her still in her highchair or something crazy like that.\n\nThe after school thing I can see her point a bit better, but it's just fifteen minutes. If she wants me home for something specific, of course I will get him early, but if it's just for the sake of being home fifteen minutes earlier, why deprive him of saying goodbye to his friends with all the other kids? She says I'm being an inconsiderate ass, but I don't think I am. I think it's important to remember the older lower maintenance kids have needs too, even if they aren't making them known with loud screaming or stinky diapers.", "created_utc": 1673872553, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ddhe3/aita_for_leaving_twenty_minutes_early_and_not/", "score": 700, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I guess I\u2019m not understanding why she needs you earlier and if you take the the little ones when you get home?", "NTA you are being a good dad by giving your son some special attention and really 15 min after school? Why is she quibbling over that?  Question\u2026do you give your wife breaks because it sounds like she might need some kid free time.  It sounds like she is feeling a little overwhelmed.  Tell her you are going to keep doing your 2.5 time a week with your son and as a compromise she can have one evening a week to leave the house without kids and go shop or go to gym, with friends or go out with older son or whatever just baby free time. She may need some kid free time or she may want some special time with your son as well.", "NAH but clearly, your wife is struggling and needs more help. I am not saying you are not already helping here, seems like you are doing plenty! But by the looks of it, she is overwhelmed and is looking for any little relief she can. Instead of trying to justify your actions and being uncompromising, why not try to find other avenues of solutions so she don't feel so distress AND you can keep your special time with your kid ?", "I\u2019m gonna go with NAH, it\u2019s great you\u2019re taking the time to give your son attention and meet his needs, but maybe you could talk with your wife more about how you can meet her needs as well \u2014 perhaps a compromise where you leave late and come home early once or twice a week?", "NTA. Thirty minutes to make sure your son gets some one-on-one attention when he has two young siblings? That seems completely reasonable to me.\n\nAre there other specific tasks in which your wife feels she needs your help? She might also be overwhelmed with an infant and a young toddler. I can understand how she would feel frustrated with you taking care of the \"easy\" kid and her taking care of the \"hard\" ones. That doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong, but it means maybe you should have a more in-depth conversation.", "Question, how much completely safe free time does your wife have every day?", "Any possibility you could have a family member or helper come by some afternoons to assist your wife before you arrive as she's running low on energy?", "Info: how many hours a week do you get out of the house away from the kids? And how many hours a week does she get out of the house away from the kids?", "NAH. Something else is up if she is clocking your activities in 15-20 minute increments. With two under 2 years old, this is a severe season of life that might required you to adjust your normal activities to give her relief that she is explicitly asking for. She is healing from two births less than 18 months apart (so she has been recovering from birth or pregnant for most of the last 2.5 years) and a 16 month old is eager to harm themselves so she isn't getting peace. I think shifting your 1:1 time with your 6 year old might be necessary. Let her know you can stick around before school but over the weekend you and your son will take off for lunch 1:1 and you will cover her sleeping in that morning with the littles and the next day you will cover her for lunch out with big brother too.", "INFO: So I am clear on this, she wants him pulled out of class 15 minutes earlier because she need your help at home with the two littles?", "What if, budget allowing, you and your son leave right on the dot at 5:15 a couple nights a week, and go pick up dinner on your way home? Let your son know ahead of time that you\u2019re doing it, and message it as \u201cremember, we\u2019ve got to be ready to go at 5:15 so we can pick up dinner - it\u2019s Mom\u2019s extra break day\u201d or something like that. So it feels special and important, and he understands that you\u2019re making sure both of you get your time. And either those evenings or another time, son should get some special Mom time away from home and the younger kids, so they can keep bonding and she gets a bit of \u201ceasier kid\u201d time too.", "NAH, you're trying to do right by your son, but the baby is only two months old. Surely you could temporarily pause or lessen this habit until the baby is a tiny bit older? That age was always hardest for me because the baby is still sleeping like a newborn at night but isn't a content potato during the day anymore.", "NTA\n\nI think it's lovely that you do this. It is very easy for the elder more independent child to get overlooked.\n\nWe realised this a bit late with our eldest. I started to feel that I had no connection with him/her. (Vague for anonymity)\n\nBut at my husband's suggestion I started spending regular, individual time with our eldest. (In the evenings after younger ones were asleep) And I think it paid off.\n\nWhere you could do better (if you have any capacity for anything else with work and 3 children) is to gain the agreement and cooperation of your wife. It is hard work being alone with two such young ones. Maybe she could take your son to school some days and go to the cafe. Or fit in some twosome time with him at the weekend or evenings.", "NTA. It's not like you are going out drinking or having fun alone in those 2 hours. You are taking care of your son.", "NTA - you are making a concerted effort to manage your time with & for your children in a totally unselfish way. I think this makes you an excellent dad. Nice work", "NAH\n\n\nBut you are still a bit in the wrong? \n\n\n\"I think it is important to remeber the older, lower maintenance kids\"- that is the right way of thinking. \n\n\nBut to decide alone that your wife has the time to care for the other 2, high maintenace, children alone for longer, doesn't get the same opportunity, and probably has to shedule dinner after this is an ahole move. In the mornings, when the little ones are cared for, it would also be an opportunity for your wife to have time for the older one. \n\n\nI also kind of doubt that the 15 minutes in the afternoon are actually 15 minutes. The programm ends, kids talk, you sometimes run errands before? Maybe I'm wrong. Doesn't really matter. \n\n\nThere is a lot of room for compromise. Like not doing both on all 5 days but just going early some days or whatever.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Extreme micromanagement. Controlling.\n\nMaybe she is stressed with the two at home, or something else, causing an outsized reaction. But requiring you to be highly specific within ~~15~~ 35 minute increments when you already have a routine that works is beyond me.\n\nE: 15->35. Pendantic IMO, but whatever, still an obnoxiously low amount of time(s) to try to be forcing your SO to abide by, so point still stands. And he is still doing things for the family in that time. It is a rediculous point. And in the comments, he mentions she takes a nap or a long bath when he gets home. Would he be within his right to tell her not to do that? Absolutely not IMO.", "YTA, not for paying attention to your older child but for not understanding and empathizing with your wife. It sounds like you don't know what it's like to be alone with a baby and toddler from early morning to evening five days in a row every week. It is super exhausting and isolating. It's also possible that she has post partum depression. You're completely right that your eldest child needs individual attention. But there's a way to do that without minimizing what your wife is going through. In your post, you make it sound like her requesting you to be home a little more is unreasonable, and that she should have a specific reason in order to request that. She does have a specific reason, which is that she is drowning in mothering two babies all day long. She is crying for help and you are not understanding.\n\nFirst, empathize with her and express appreciation for what she is doing for the family. Then, discuss ideas together for your eldest child to get individual attention without making her have longer days alone with baby and toddler. Maybe you and your eldest have your special time together when the babies are in bed. Maybe you come straight home with him after work and your wife takes him out for a little treat while you watch the babies.", "If she's saying you're \"slacking\" and \"being an inconsiderate ass\" then you're NTA, she is.\n\nIf she's bringing it up in a reasonable manner to discuss then no one is TA, seems like a fair thing to talk about, no reason to argue. Maybe can meet somewhere in the middle by picking up your son 15min early every other day or something similar.", "NTA. Your son deserves this time. Your wife is being unreasonable. It sounds like you get the toddler fed and dressed in the morning before you leave so your wife is only taking care of the infant before you leave.", "YTA.  A huge one.  If she tells you those 20 minutes matter, then those 20 minutes matter.  Why do you get to tell her they don't?  Are you the creator of reality? When you say they don't you are calling her a liar.  Do you realize this?  You are trying to tell her what reality is instead of listening to her tell you what her reality is.  \n  \nIf you have to ask about this, you really don't understand how long 15 extra minutes is at the end of the day for someone that has 2 kids under 2.  Help your wife.   This isn't \"just for the sake of being home fifteen minutes earlier\" this is for the sake of your wife's long term mental health.  And not building up her resentment against you.  \n\nMorning time, having a routine with your 6yr old is great.  You are right. Making sure he gets some time with you alone is a great idea.  \n\nAfternoon time.  Man, you are blowing it.  Here is what you are saying: Love of my life, woman that I decided should be my partner forever, F your feelings. F your needs.  Only **I** get to decide what is important or not.  I don't care that you would like an extra 15 minutes of time in your night, your stress level doesn't matter to me.  Your thoughts on the matter don't matter to me, your feelings don't matter to me.  I am not willing to listen to you, I am not willing to compromise. I am not willing to give you time away from the house to do those errands while I am alone with all 3 kids.  \n\nOnly I get to decide how our time is spent, and I am declaring that I will not be a parent to my number one son, I will be his buddy.  I don't want to be around when he expresses disappointment for not getting his way, I don't want to be the one that helps him work through his disappointment and teaches him appropriate coping skills. I refuse to get him at 5:15 and take the time to use it as a teaching tool and redirect him, I just can't handle that task.   \n\nOf course your 6 yr old wants to stay with his friends.  And he will when he is 7, and 8, and 10, and 30, and 50.  It is up to YOU to figure out the way to balance out everything.  And you are moving towards failing.  I have too many friends where one parent just thought that little extra time they nibbled off every day, or every week didn't matter, but it was like a pebble in the shoe. Just enough to keep them irritated\n\nListen to your wife.  Ask her how you can help her.  Ask her her ideas for making sure your boy isn't forgotten.  Don't just make the decision that keeps you away from home the maximum amount of time. Use those 15 minutes at home for 1-1 time with your boy instead. Just having you there in case there is a minor emergency will help her relax a little.  At the very least compromise and make it every other week that you pick kiddo up at 5:15.  But seriously, LISTEN to your wife.  If she isn't budging on this, it is serious.", "NTA", "YTA. Your wife is obviously overwhelmed by 5:30. Maybe you should go home, get the younger kids, and take them with you to pick up big brother. It\u2019s also a shit excuse to use your kid, as an excuse to get extra time everywhere. \n\nMaybe breakfast is 1 day a week, and one morning you take all kids. \n\nShe is telling you what she needs, yes it\u2019s not as kind as it could be, but she\u2019s telling you.

I think it\u2019s important to narrow down the reason.", "It sounds like maybe your wife is overwhelmed. Her focus is in that extra 20 minutes. Cutting that time will not solve the issue.

There's no need to swear at you about this. A compromise can easily be reached through a conversation", "NTA you are parenting, not slinking off. It is incredibly important to have a one on one touch base conversation with your kids.

I think you have good intentions, but I also think from your comments saying \u2018it\u2019s just 15 minutes and he needs to learn skills\u2019, you\u2019re slightly in denial that the real reason is that you love those 15 minutes and you don\u2019t want to be the bad guy picking your son up early. Which is understandable, and not wanting him to feel left out is commendable. However, you have also said that your son does get alone time every weekend plus trips out, a yoga class etc. \n\nYes, kids \u2018need to learn to say goodbye\u2019, but he does that at the end of the school day, and kids also need to learn that we come home and help our loved ones when we\u2019re tired. How would you feel if when your daughter grew up, she was looking after two toddlers all day every day, and her husband refused to come home just so he could be The Fun Parent for a bit longer? \n\nNo one is saying being the working parent is easy, but you have to recognise that you have spent the day at work, talking to adults, able to go to the bathroom without two people clinging to you or crying. Meanwhile, your wife is spending close to ten hours constantly switched on, constantly thinking about two other people\u2019s needs before her own, with none of the small luxuries you have. \n\nAll she is asking for is that you come home and help when you can, instead of roaming around outside so you can have some alone time and your son can play and you don\u2019t have to be the Bad Parent. If it\u2019s \u2018only 15 minutes\u2019, why is it such a big deal for you not to? Is \u2018only 15 minutes\u2019 really worth forcing your wife to continue to hold the fort down at home when she\u2019s at her most tired? \n\nI really don\u2019t think that you can begrudge her this in good conscience when you haven\u2019t been the one at home every day with 2 under 2. She is telling you how drained she is, and you are prioritising the wrong things.", "NTA and I think it's great to spend time with your older child as they can get forgotten. Your wife however is clearly getting stressed and I've been there. Reason and logical thinking goes out the window so be patient and kind with her and do what you can", "NTA and I'm sure both you and your son enjoy this little routine you have. It's also good practice for keeping the lines of communication open as he gets older. Maybe offer your wife a night off from bedtime routines to help it seem more equal.", "NTA. And you are a good father for giving your kid some one-on-one time. As the eldest of 5 kids, that was something we hardly ever had, and the few times it did happen, I still remember, more than 50 years later. Remember to do the same with the other two kids, once they are a bit older. If your wife feels you are shirking duties somehow, you should have a seperate discussion about that.", "Having been in a similar situation I am going with YTA. Leaving those 20 minutes earlier means you're not helping with breakfast or feeding the other kids, making the bed, or helping the other kids get dressed. You have an excuse to leave your responsibilities for your wife to handle. The tasks you're running in the afternoon,I bet your wife would LOVE to get a few minutes to herself even if it's just picking up a few things.\n\nOh, and that lame excuse that you need to have some alone time with your kid, guess what... you can do that at home, you can even have him help you with some chores while you talk. Show him how a man is supposed to help, rather than be a burden on their partner. It's nice to want your son to have some time alone with you, but not at the expense of your wife.", "She usually takes a nap when I get home. Or a long bath.

We try to have some routines, but every day is very different.", "I'm away from the kids at work, so that's 35-40 hours a week.

The last thirty minutes of the program are the socialization/unsupervised play part, and that's my son's favorite part. He likes playing with his little friends. I don't want to make him leave early, because I like that he is building friendships. I don't want to cramp his style, lol.", "That would take longer than fifteen minutes, which would mean we get home later, which is the opposite of what she wants. Also, if we get the food that early it will all be cold by dinnertime.", "It's fifteen minutes. Sometimes I grab stuff at the store to get there at five-thirty, and sometimes I just wait the fifteen minutes. The kids saying goodbye is actually built into the schedule to prevent the very thing you are talking about, because they don't want people to dawdle after the program ends.", "Yeah, she spends a lot of the time out of the house on the weekend. This conflict is just about weekdays. We have a really good weekend system we both like.", "It is 35 min. daily. Just a detail.", "OP\u2019s wife gets 1-on-1 time with the oldest, and the time during the week is the ONLY time OP can spend with him solo, as he is the one responsible for the babies on the weekend so his wife can go out with her friends on Saturdays and spend time with the eldest on Sunday afternoons. She gets more free time AND more 1-on-1 time with their son than OP does.", "She did. And he called it silly.", "Sort of. She's on maternity leave. She hasn't decided yet whether she wants to go back to work or not. She's got two more months to decide, and she switches from day to day what she's leaning towards.", "Not on a daily basis.

I\u2019ve been the stay at home mum, on maternity leave and provider so I see all sides of this. Working at a job isn\u2019t a break. It\u2019s work. I get that she\u2019s tired and needs a break. The fact that you come home taking the kids so she rests, but just wants you home earlier so she can rest is inconsiderate. Does she know why you do that?", "Sounds like you're both just stressed parents to three young children. It's a lot. Just seems to me like there is something else going on for your wife to be upset, and it's not just you taking extra time with your son. So I would just say that it's worth trying to delve into whether there's something else under the surface that she's really struggling with.", "If you aren\u2019t actively parenting both you children at the same time, then she will never have a break. You have to make sure that you take care of both and encourage her to take time to breathe. That doesn\u2019t mean sitting on the couch looking at your phone, it means packing them up and taking them out.", "I think he meant not including work hours.", "Well then you are being told she can't spare you for ~90 minutes in the AM and ~75 in the PM during the week, so get on it. People always lament that they don't know how to help new moms or people dealing with acute crisis. Your wife is telling you she needs more from you so do the needful.", "I knew what you meant, I misspoke.... errr typed. :)  But, I got the why you give him that extra 15 minutes. I'm asking about the \"why\" your wife wants you to pull him out 15 minutes earlier. Is it because she needs your help at home?", "I think you\u2019re NTA but I understand your wife is feeling frustrated and honestly she\u2019s probably counting the minutes until you get home. You have a TWO MONTH OLD. She\u2019s still recovering from giving birth! She\u2019s probably exhausted. As someone who just a third baby, it took a while for us to figure out a good schedule. You just added a new baby to your family; your 6yo could learn to compromise a little too and come home early a few days so you can give her more support. \n\nSometimes 5-6 is one of the worst hours of the day. They\u2019re hungry, you\u2019re cooking dinner, getting things ready for the next day, babies are tired, etc etc. I agree it\u2019s only 15 minutes but maybe you could try to be home earlier a few days a week. Additionally,  your wife may be feeling like she\u2019s lacking with one on one time with your 6yo. I nurse our baby and that means I\u2019m up in the night a lot and also I\u2019m on baby duty more than I\u2019m on kid duty and I want to make sure I get one on one time with my kids, too.", "Running to the store to grab something might sound like an errand to you and feel like you're doing something useful. Let me tell you, mom groups are full of posts where moms talk about a child-free errand being heaven because it's a chance to have a little alone time. You are taking the easier work during that 35 minutes a day at the expense of prolonging her doing the harder work which she's already doing all day every weekday.", "Thanks for the clarification!", "That's great, but it doesn't alleviate the super long hours she spends as the sole caregiver to two babies with no respite. It sounds like that respite on weekdays is really what she needs.", "That\u2019s great you have a functioning weekend system, especially one that makes you both happy. \n\nHowever, it does suggest that the weekday problem is a lot deeper than your post makes out. \n\nYou get to go to work, talk/socialise with people, spend time commuting where you can listen to music or podcasts, get time to yourself *every day*, spend time with your son every day. \n\nI can see why she\u2019s frustrated, and calling the above \u2018not a huge chunk of time\u2019 is dismissive. \n\nI think you need to take her concerns seriously so that you can come up with a solution.", "Yes, and she gets more solo time with the child she isn\u2019t around until after OP gets home with him than OP does throughout the week.", "Do you have kids? Not asking in a confrontational way but just wondering if you know how utterly depleting it is to spend 9 hours a day five days a week taking care of an infant who needs frequent care and a toddler who is active and needs to be watched closely every minute.

This gives her time to do a quick errand by herself and some time with her older son. \n\nShe also may need an evening a week (or whatever time frame works) to herself as well. \n\nRemember - parenting is a team effort and sometimes one member of the team needs some time on the bench.", "My husband\u2019s good friend lives this life since having kids almost 8 years ago. He\u2019s never doing enough and every spare minute must be accounted for. It\u2019s like his wife is afraid of being alone with their kids, ever. And they\u2019re not babies now, they\u2019re 6 and 7. \n\nHe\u2019s had to give up every hobby he has, even ones that can easily include the kids at this age, like boating and fishing.", "According to OP, wife gets 8 hours on Saturday with her friends, and spends 1 on 1 time with the eldest on Sunday", "He says in several comments that she takes a nap or a long bath as soon as he gets home while he does all childcare, she spends 8 hours out of the house with friends and without kids on Saturdays, and she takes the oldest out for yoga and lunch on Sundays while he takes care of the little ones. Sounds like she\u2019s getting more \u201ctime off\u201d from work/childcare than he is tbh", "He says he does the toddlers whole morning routine, she takes a nap or long bath every afternoon when he gets home, and she spends 8 hours out of the house with her friends every Saturday", "> that you hang with the six year old because he is a boy and the other two are girls? \n\nYou do know that older children, even 6 year olds, need love and attention from their parents, especially when they're competing for it with 2 much younger children, right?\n\nWhy assume sexism?", "As u/Ascf33 said, the whole point of this sub is to lay out your side of the story which OP did.\n\nAlso, nowhere does he say it's all about him. He does it for his son.\n\nIt's only 15 minutes difference after work and he either goes shopping while waiting for the son or just sits outside and waits for the son to be done.\n\nGoing shopping or running errands helps the family, and his whole point is that he does these things to get some time to talk to his son alone. He's being both practical and a good dad so you can't fault him there.\n\nWhile his wife does sound like she's struggling and also needs some time, nothing in the post suggests he's selfish or only thinking about himself as you seem to think.\n\nEdited just to add: OP getting breakfast and chatting with his son every morning will be a memory that the son remembers and cherishes. I still think about those times with my dad and other close family members 30+ years later.", "Where the hell are you getting the \u201cme, me, me\u201d shit from? *Maybe* he seems a little dismissive but everything he mentioned sounded a lot like it was for their son not himself. I mean the wife doesn\u2019t seem all that considerate with the way she\u2019s wording it either. If she\u2019s struggling she should use her words instead of claiming OP is slacking over a whole 30 minutes a day. If she\u2019s acting as if he magically wouldn\u2019t be slacking by cutting that time out then it\u2019s obviously not about the time.", "> Everything they say is me, me, me - what I want and what I\u2019m doing.\n\nIt would be really weird if they didn't talk about themselves in a conflict-based board where they're only allowed to talk about situations that they're involved in.", "Yes the wife is struggling. But the answer isn\u2019t punishing the 6 year old. The answer is finding out what will help her besides punishing the 6 year old. I am betting if he offered her some alone time she wouldn\u2019t have a problem with the 6 year old\u2019s time to himself.", "The daycare I had didn\u2019t operate like that either. We all got there at the same time and we all left at the same time.

I like getting out a few minutes earlier, but I can't expect it.", ">I am trying to paint this dude as thinking he is the CEO of the family, and her beliefs are subordinate to his.\n\nShe literally gets a full 8 hour block with zero commitment or responsibility, whereas OP gets... 30 minutes to run errands at the end of the workday 5 days a week. So, whoopee, he gets 2.5 hours a week in which he's still contributing to his family.", "> If you aren\u2019t actively parenting both you children at the same time, then she will never have a break.\n\nThat's a funny way to take that.", "That could be a very good solution.  It does not make you bad parents!", "You might be right.  I can't say for sure.", "Why are you crazy angry? Breathe!", "> Like maybe she feels like she isn't getting enough help in general.\n\nI mean we just had a child 6 months ago, and both of us feel like we don't have enough help even though we're both giving 100%.

As it stands, even if you count the 15 minutes/weekday, he's getting a whopping hour and 15 minutes a week, and she's getting a full block of 8 hours every weekend. Just because he isn't doing work as 'intense' as childcare when he's at work doesn't mean it's stressfree downtime.\n\nIf she's so beyond exhausted because of taking care of the kids, maybe she can get a job and put the paycheck toward daycare for them - evidently it'd be worth it for the break she'd get, even if she doesn't pull in any actual income from it.", "NTA. I think you and your wife need to have a conversation because something deeper is going on here. Is she feeling overwhelmed?", "NTA. Those couple minutes will be in your child\u2019s heart and mind forever- nothing is more important than that.", "NTA. You spend time with your 6yo in the mornings, and run errands or get 15 minutes to relax while you wait for him in the afternoon. You take on all the kids when you get home so your wife can relax, and then you work together for dinner and bedtime. You take all the kids Saturday so she gets time to do what she wants, and you take the 2 littlest while she spends time with your 6yo on Sunday. You said you split cooking dinner and household chores. If you leave later in the morning and come home earlier in the afternoon you won't have any time alone with your 6yo, and his socialization will be cut short. These are both important and shouldn't be eliminated. It doesn't sound like you get any time to relax and do something you want for any length of time. You shouldn't ignore that even if it's just one a month. \n\nYou mentioned you were considering telling your wife to go ahead and put the 2 littlest down to nap and start her nap earlier before you get home, and that sounds like a good idea to give her a little extra time to relax. If either of the kids are fussy she might not be able to do it every day, but it would be a little extra time for her when they aren't.", "NAH keep communicating with your wife. She obviously is overwhelmed", "NTA. You are spending time with your son. He probably really needs it with 2 babies in the house.", "NTA. Your oldest child needs that time too. It sounds like you are doing your best and she gets her time on the weekends.", "Your wife needs a break. 15 or 20 min is not much to ask.", "NTA. You\u2019re being an excellent dad. Perhaps you could do a little something just for your wife. Take both kids for a bit on the weekend, bring a small tribute, flowers or something you know she likes. Date night. Have her ask your 6 year old what he thinks about leaving after school early or not leaving for school until the last minute. Frankly I don\u2019t understand your wife.", "NTA. I think spending the extra 30 minutes a day bonding with your son is important. He probably needs it as well, because having 2 siblings under the age of 2 takes a lot of work & probably doesn\u2019t get as much attention as he wants/needs.

Saturdays with her friends and then Sundays with the 6 year old.", "He said she takes the 6yo out Sunday afternoons.", "She gets every weekend...", "She gets every Saturday to herself and then her and the oldest have a standing Sunday ritual.

She also has Sunday afternoons with just the 6 year old. He's the one with no time alone.", "After work and picking up the 6yo, OP takes over so the kids so his wife gets a nap or bath before dinner and night routines to get kids to bed.

Plus she has every sunday with the older son.", "Of course the older one loves his alone time with dad, and no one is saying that\u2019s a bad thing. The problem is that OP\u2019s wife is at home with a two-month old and one year-old, which means she\u2019s had two babies within 14 months and gave birth to the last one just two months ago. She\u2019s saying that she needs that extra time from him and OP shouldn\u2019t just dismiss it as \u201csilly.\u201d While he\u2019s having this nice one-on-one time with his son, his wife is dealing with \u201cloud screaming or stinky diapers.\u201d", "Should 6 year old having fun be more important than wife's need for help with the younger kids?
