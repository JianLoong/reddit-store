They asked, you showed a list and requested they only get you one item. You can't control their actions thereafter. Mum should speak to your grandparents if she has such a big issue with it.", "NTA. You specified to just get one. A wishlist is smart, if they insist on getting gifts and often get not stuff.\n\nYour grandparents are just super rich and generous it seems. Maybe gifts are their love language, too.\n\n>my mom likes to pretend she is self made rich and doesn\u2019t need them when they gave her millions to startup her business and a house but apparently that\u2019s different since she didn\u2019t ask for them\n\nClassic.\n\nShe started from nothing and pulled herself up by the bootstraps with only a small $2+ million investment from family ahahaha", "NTA, it's your mom's responsibility to set boundaries with your grandparents when it comes to gift giving if she doesn't like it.
