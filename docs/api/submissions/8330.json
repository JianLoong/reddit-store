They're perfectly capable of making that decision for themselves.", "NTA. It\u2019s very normal to send a wishlist for ideas for gifts. I use it with my family and my in-laws. You also specifies they only need to get you one thing and they decided to be generous and treat you.", "NTA", "NTA, you did ask them only for one gift. They made the choice to get them all.", "NTA - I am this grandparent, but I make sure my Son is OK with it as well. \n\nIf his parents say \"go\" , I spoil mine rotten. Intent is the key, here. Maybe ask why your mom feels disrespected? If she can't give an answer then she's being ridiculous. \n\nYou're grown, so, it's actually not her business, really.", "NTA. They insisted you show them your wishlist. Especially bcs they want and can afford to gift it to you, and you never ASKED to get gifted, you have nothing to feel shameful about. Grandparents like to gift their grandkids. As long you dont start using it to your advantage qnd ask for unreasonable gifts, no problem. You should just tell your mother she should then give her parents bacl what they gave her, since she is not a beggar \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05", "This is what happens when you have good,loving grandparents who are proud of you and can afford to spoil you. Your mom just sounds jealous. NTA", "Also, nothing worse then to receive a gift you dont like and probably will never use, so better to know what your preferences are. Otherwise its really just waste of their money and not what the gifter is after. To buy stuff that the gifted is gonna never use.", "And it doesn't seem like a boundary so much as a guilt trip. I mean, who pressures their kid not to ask for what they want when asked?", "Now don\u2019t get carried away!", "Or at least her sweet 16! I'm sure her friends will be super jealous!", "[https://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/ke8skw/the\\_poop\\_knife/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/ke8skw/the_poop_knife/)\n\nthis is not the original though, just a reposted one I think, because the old one was removed for some reason", "NTA. My partner and I insist on Christmas/birthday lists from our adult kids.  The last thing we want to do is buy something they do not need.", "NTA they wanted to give you a gift, they asked for ideas. You gave them ideas. It was their decision to do what they did. If your mom doesn't like it, she should be talking to her parents and putting down boundaries. That is in no way, shape or form on you.", "A list is a good idea because that way, you minimise getting useless shit you don't want/need.  Of course, it relies on people actually caring to look at the list and sometimes it can backfire, since people will often just get the cheapest item and you end up with lots of the same cheapest thing.  Fortunately for you, listing stuff didn't backfire.  \n\nYou specified they only needed to get one thing off the list.  They could have got the cheapest item, or the most expensive item, but all they needed to do was get you one thing.  They chose to get most of the stuff.  Your mother might try to control and/or guilt trip you, but she cannot do the same to them.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  The difference between you and a beggar is that your grandparents asked you what you would like as a gift.  You didn't ask them for a gift or give them a list with the intention of receiving every item.  Sounds like Mom has an issue with her parents and is trying to pin that on you.", "As an aside I got the view that your grandparents want to show you that they love you based on this.\n\nIf you don\u2019t already and are comfortable doing so, try to see if you can spend time with them or contact them more.", "I understood that reference!", "but ONLY if she is from Florida, mind you. ONLY IF.", "That's the one."]}
