My parents are friends with this couple and I've known them like my whole life, they moved to a different country a few years ago so my parents only see them a couple times a year. They came over to see my parents a few days ago, last time they were here it was February.\n\nWe were talking and they asked me how 10th grade was going I told them that I don't know because I've been in a mental hospital the whole time. They asked me a few questions about it, like why I was there and stuff and I answered all of their questions honestly.\n\nAfter they left my parents got really annoyed at me for telling them. They said that I was doing it purposely to portray them as bad parents. They also said that I should keep it a secret because it's not important for other people to know. I didn't know I wasn't supposed to tell anyone but I didn't think it was that much of a big deal. I don't get why they're so pissed over it. Their friends didn't even care they were interested they weren't judging anyone of us I don't think. They've been really pissed at me since. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1703334139, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18p4lix/aita_for_telling_my_parents_friends_that_i_was_in/", "score": 9, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don\u2019t think they are AHs for saying it\u2019s better to not talk about it\u2014 it\u2019s very possible it wasn\u2019t about their shame that you had a mental health crisis or their fear people will judge them but their fear that you will be treated badly by others.\n\nWhere I think they are AHs is why didn\u2019t they talk about this concern with you before the party\u2014 months ago, even? Not \u201cdon\u2019t tell anyone! This is a secret!\u201d but conversations about your condition, and what it means to you and what it doesn\u2019t mean, and how you live with it, including how you talk about it with others. Just throwing you into a party, they didn\u2019t anticipate anyone would ask you what grade ten is like?! \n\nEven little things like wetting the bed, before my kid goes to a sleepover I talk to my kid about who to tell and why and that there\u2019s a stigma but it just means their bladder is small, etc. I can\u2019t imagine not spending a minute with you before throwing you into a party to similarly talk to you about your condition.", "NTA absolutely not. That is YOUR lived experience and your right to share if it comes up. If your parents are so worried about their image and how your experience paints them in a bad light, I\u2019m sorry because that\u2019s narcissistic behavior. It begs the question that maybe they don\u2019t have your best interests in mind, especially if it\u2019s family friends who didn\u2019t even read that much into it. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you, mental health is just as important as physical and you being open to talk about it is huge! When I was younger I felt so much shame for it so be proud of being able to openly discuss and share it with those you know and trust! Don\u2019t let this trouble you too much, if anything it\u2019s your parents that need to do some contemplation.", "NTA. Good for you on being honest. Sounds like you parents are embarrassed that you were there. You should ask them if you had diabetes and in the hospital will they be embarrassed over that. Mental illness is a disease like any other disease is. So do you have to repeat 10th grade over?", "NTA\n\nYour business is yours to share with the people you trust. If your Parents are uncomfortable, it's on the two of them to resolve their own issues. It sounds like you've had enough going on in your head already without taking on their feelings about your feelings.", "NTA. You are 15, you were in a mental hospital, you already have way too much going on to bother with this shit. Your parents should've had a conversation with you if they really cared about how you should present yourself to others when it comes down to sharing personal stuff like that, but they didn't. On top of that they even got MAD at you for doing this? They are definitely the assholes here IMO. Are they even good parents? You might want to have a discussion about your parents with a therapist, and also ask for advice on how you should be presenting yourself when it comes down to stuff like that.", "NTA. Fuck your parents for putting there self image over your wellbeing. Talk to whoever you want and don't hide parts of yourself. That's healthy, not whatever your parents suggest you should do instead.", "NTA. Secrets are bad - full stop. \n\nI admire your willingness to simply tell the truth and be honest. I hope you are stronger every day because of your experiences and your treatment.\n\nI am a 57F who worked in the psych ward as a Registered Nurse for 10 years in the US.\n\nParents, and often those around them, view their children needing hospitalization as a short-coming of their parenting.  So, maybe you needed to be hospitalized due to school/public experiences, or simply the pressures of growing up, or maybe be due to poor parenting... or even just genetic influences.\n\nI hope you can be a happy and productive person no matter what. Just remember that your parents are people also. They have to look their \"friends\" in the eye and explain the hospitalization.\n\nStay strong, use your resources, be loyal to yourself and appreciate your parents for doing the best that they can."]}
