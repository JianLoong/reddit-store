My parents are friends with this couple and I've known them like my whole life, they moved to a different country a few years ago so my parents only see them a couple times a year. They came over to see my parents a few days ago, last time they were here it was February.\n\nWe were talking and they asked me how 10th grade was going I told them that I don't know because I've been in a mental hospital the whole time. They asked me a few questions about it, like why I was there and stuff and I answered all of their questions honestly.\n\nAfter they left my parents got really annoyed at me for telling them. They said that I was doing it purposely to portray them as bad parents. They also said that I should keep it a secret because it's not important for other people to know. I didn't know I wasn't supposed to tell anyone but I didn't think it was that much of a big deal. I don't get why they're so pissed over it. Their friends didn't even care they were interested they weren't judging anyone of us I don't think. They've been really pissed at me since. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1703334139, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18p4lix/aita_for_telling_my_parents_friends_that_i_was_in/", "score": 131, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don\u2019t think they are AHs for saying it\u2019s better to not talk about it\u2014 it\u2019s very possible it wasn\u2019t about their shame that you had a mental health crisis or their fear people will judge them but their fear that you will be treated badly by others.\n\nWhere I think they are AHs is why didn\u2019t they talk about this concern with you before the party\u2014 months ago, even? Not \u201cdon\u2019t tell anyone! This is a secret!\u201d but conversations about your condition, and what it means to you and what it doesn\u2019t mean, and how you live with it, including how you talk about it with others. Just throwing you into a party, they didn\u2019t anticipate anyone would ask you what grade ten is like?! \n\nEven little things like wetting the bed, before my kid goes to a sleepover I talk to my kid about who to tell and why and that there\u2019s a stigma but it just means their bladder is small, etc. I can\u2019t imagine not spending a minute with you before throwing you into a party to similarly talk to you about your condition.", "NTA absolutely not. That is YOUR lived experience and your right to share if it comes up. If your parents are so worried about their image and how your experience paints them in a bad light, I\u2019m sorry because that\u2019s narcissistic behavior. It begs the question that maybe they don\u2019t have your best interests in mind, especially if it\u2019s family friends who didn\u2019t even read that much into it. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you, mental health is just as important as physical and you being open to talk about it is huge! When I was younger I felt so much shame for it so be proud of being able to openly discuss and share it with those you know and trust! Don\u2019t let this trouble you too much, if anything it\u2019s your parents that need to do some contemplation.", "NTA. Good for you on being honest. Sounds like you parents are embarrassed that you were there. You should ask them if you had diabetes and in the hospital will they be embarrassed over that. Mental illness is a disease like any other disease is. So do you have to repeat 10th grade over?", "NTA\n\nYour business is yours to share with the people you trust. If your Parents are uncomfortable, it's on the two of them to resolve their own issues. It sounds like you've had enough going on in your head already without taking on their feelings about your feelings.", "NTA. You are 15, you were in a mental hospital, you already have way too much going on to bother with this shit. Your parents should've had a conversation with you if they really cared about how you should present yourself to others when it comes down to sharing personal stuff like that, but they didn't. On top of that they even got MAD at you for doing this? They are definitely the assholes here IMO. Are they even good parents? You might want to have a discussion about your parents with a therapist, and also ask for advice on how you should be presenting yourself when it comes down to stuff like that.", "NTA. Fuck your parents for putting there self image over your wellbeing. Talk to whoever you want and don't hide parts of yourself. That's healthy, not whatever your parents suggest you should do instead.", "NTA. Secrets are bad - full stop. \n\nI admire your willingness to simply tell the truth and be honest. I hope you are stronger every day because of your experiences and your treatment.\n\nI am a 57F who worked in the psych ward as a Registered Nurse for 10 years in the US.\n\nParents, and often those around them, view their children needing hospitalization as a short-coming of their parenting.  So, maybe you needed to be hospitalized due to school/public experiences, or simply the pressures of growing up, or maybe be due to poor parenting... or even just genetic influences.\n\nI hope you can be a happy and productive person no matter what. Just remember that your parents are people also. They have to look their \"friends\" in the eye and explain the hospitalization.\n\nStay strong, use your resources, be loyal to yourself and appreciate your parents for doing the best that they can.", "Unequivocal NTA. Dear sweet Angel\u2026.YOU ARE NOT THE ASSHOLE. FULt!!!\n\nPlease don\u2019t give any validity to any of the \u201cexplanations\u201dthey give you as justification for their asshole behavior. \n\nThey are asshole because of the following: -Mental healthcare is imperatives to quality of life. \n\n-No 15 year old wants to be in an inpatient psychiatric treatment by choice, \nPop\n-Treating severe enough disorders is an extremely difficult mental challenge in the best of times, and at its most challenging times  in peak teenage hormone glory and the sociological and psychological thunder dome equivalent to a pitch black labyrinth  filed with cobras and radioactive fallout, your not fully baked brain is focusing on keeping you survival style alive, not dealing with societal graces and lying to be polite or not have people think badly of your parents because they provided comprehensive medical care to their child. \n\n-Being able to speak about your life in a way that makes you feel whole and empowered. Not having to deal with hiding things and lying about things causing shame and guilt is a huge deal!!! This is very healthy and talking like this removes the stigma from needing medical treatment for a medical issue. \n\n-Other peoples shame or embarrassment is not your responsibility and does not fall on the shoulders of a child that is still mentally developing and is dealing with some pretty big issues. \n\n-If your parents wanted you to keep your medical information private and to explain things differently they should have spoken to you about it first and to have a thoughtful discussion about the topic.\n\nI hope this helps a bit, happy holidays and I hope your life become all of the things you\u2019d love it to be. You seem to be doing well outside of the hospital so I hope that you\u2019re getting to start enjoying life again. It\u2019s really tough to have to fight through quicksand uphill both ways for a long time.", "Never be ashamed about your mental state, or the help you seek to help you. There is nothing wrong with that. So speak about it as much as you want. It is most likely positive for you to be open about it. \n\nNTA", "So this is from someone who is in their mid 30s and was also in a psych ward for most of grade 11... \n\nNTA. Similarly, my parents were ashamed of me struggling and made it all about themselves. For years, it also made me ashamed and I hid it from everyone. Over the years I had a few more hospital admissions and tried to keep my struggles from everyone. In the end, I feel like I have been lying and hiding a huge part of myself for decades. It's a horrible feeling,  not helpful, and entirely for other people's comfort. It feels like i have not really connected with anyone because i am living a lie of sorts. I wish I felt like I could just live more genuinely and be honest with people, but I still have so much deep rooted shame that I feel like a can't. \n\nYour parents shame is not your problem. They are adults that need to figure it out and deal with it themselves. They are being incredibly selfish. If you had another illness like diabetes or cancer, they would not be ashamed of it or asking you to hide it. Hiding it will only hurt you in the end and they are placing a huge burden on you because they don't want to deal with their own feelings, and that is on THEM not YOU.", "NTA\n\n\"My parents taught me better than to be a liar.\"", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"hey said that I was doing it purposely to portray them as bad parents.\" .. the problem is that they are bad parents. NOT that other people know.", "There is an ongoing persistent stigma about mental health.......\n\nYou needed help, and you got help.  You were asked questions, and answered them honestly.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with what you did.\n\n It sounds like your parents are embarrassed about the whole issue and want to sweep it under the rug.\n\nNTA OP.", "NTA at all. You have the right to decide whether to share or not share personal information about yourself and your life.  It sounds as if your parents are ashamed and embarrassed about your needing psychiatric help maybe because unfortunately it still carries a stigma in some people's eyes. I remember being in my late teens and being a day patient at a psychiatric day hospital and my mother told me to tell none of the neighbours. However, one of the neighbours turned out to have a sister who was admitted as a patient so the neighbours found out anyway. It didn't bother me at all that they knew and I hated my mother being ashamed and embarrassed by it.", "NTA! i\u2019m proud of you for getting the help you needed and for being honest about your loved experience. your parents are being absolute twits. i highly recommend the book \u201cit\u2019s kind of a funny story\u201d which is about a teenager, i think the same age as you, who spends time in a psych ward. the book was inspired by the author\u2019s own time in a psych ward himself. good luck with your future OP!", "NTA \n\nThis was like when I went to the psych ward and after my family visited the nurse was like \u201cyea ok just say you don\u2019t want visitors anymore I can see why you are so stressed\u201d\n\nWhy do people make you feel worse when you already feel bad.", "NTA. Sounds like you might have bad parents.", "NTA, your health history is nobody's but your own to decide whether to talk about.  Your friends sound great :-D\n\nAlso, here's a good one:\n\nQ: What's the difference between a psych nurse and a psych patient?  \nA: The psych patient eventually gets to leave.", "NTA. Looks like your parents are overly concerned with appearances.", "Nta, this is your experience and if you felt ok with sharing that\u2019s your right to do so. I had a similar experience and my mom always allowed me to talk or to not talk about it as I pleased. She never made me feel embarrassed about discussing my life.", "I commend your honesty and you shouldn't keep your meantal health issues secret.\n\nI have an acquantance who had daughters who ended up in specialized care because of early-onset issues, and it was heartbreaking, but as she wasn't averse to sharing, she got more social support which she needed!\n\nNTA", "NTA - it is your life, your experience and your story to tell (or not tell) to whoever you want! In fact, I think your parents should be proud of the fact that you aren't ashamed to talk about it because struggling with mental health shouldn't be viewed as shameful and talking about us is the only way to break the stigma. That being said, don't ever feel like you HAVE to talk about it if you don't want to!", "NTA. People like your parents are the reason there is such a stigma around having mental health problems in the first place. It is your health, your life, your story to tell.  \nThe only reason they'd come off as 'bad parents' in this situation is if they have in fact done something to be ashamed of.", "Thanks man", "It\u2019s OP\u2019s info to share, or not.  Parents are AH for asking Op to keep it a secret, that\u2019s especially bad for someone with mental health issues.  I suspect the therapist would have an issue with that.", "Thank you sm", "Thank you so much \u2764\ufe0f", "Thank you :)", "Hee-hee....\n\nMy mother used to be a psychiatric nurse.....\n\nShe would occasionally tell my brother and I that the patients in the psych ward were easier to deal with than we were.  :-D", "You being open about it is what we need more of if we want people to be more open to getting help for mental health.  Your parents reaction is the reaction that makes people feel ashamed to admit that they can't handle their depression or anxiety or other issues.   Sometimes with horrible results.  Keep being unashamed.  Be proud you got help.", "NTA. I (30F) too, spent a good portion of middle/high school in psychiatric hospitals. And it had nothing to do with how good my parents were. My parents, my mom at least, were excellent. It's a myth that all child or adolescent mental illnesses come from bad or abusive parenting. \n\nI work in mental health advocacy now and talk about my inpatient stays daily. If we don't talk about this stuff, the stigma and shame will remain and perpetuate the vicious cycle. Mental health hospital stays are no less normal than being in a hospital for a broken leg, and people need to know this.", "People need to stop treating mental ill- health like a shameful secret. \n\nNTA", "I struggled like this through high school and my parents used to scream at me for sharing, which put me right back.... so absolutely NTA, if they want to spin it in a positive way, they could. Please bring this up with your outpatient team. \n\nThat said, having been out of high school for 15 years... mental illnesses ARE stigmatized, and this does follow you. I lived in a smallish city (78,000 between 4 jurisdictions) and it's hard to shake off those judgments.  You may way to be careful about sharing your experience or have a plan to move away so that you can choose how you want to be remembered as you enter adulthood. And I mean this from a place of love, my graduating class was 423 people and I'm still remembered as \"the girl who wouldn't stop crying.\"", "I\u2019ve got kids your age, and I\u2019ve seen that your generation is a lot more open than mine ever was when it comes to talking about mental health. It\u2019s entirely appropriate to talk about your experiences with adults you trust. Have your parents talked to anyone about what you\u2019ve gone through? Treating it like a secret isn\u2019t helpful to you or to them. \n\nI hope you\u2019re continuing to get the support you need now that you\u2019re back home, whether that\u2019s medication, ongoing therapy, or an IEP or other educational supports. \n\nYour parents should also have their own support, whether from professionals or peers, or both. It\u2019s likely they experienced some secondary trauma during the course of your treatment. And I want to be really clear that it\u2019s not your job to manage that! \n\nBottom line, I\u2019m really proud of you for getting the help you needed. I wish you all the best going forward. Tell your folks I told them to get their heads out of their asses (not really! But they should be supporting you better!)."]}
