Mom is setting up her son for an unhealthy relationship with \u201cbad\u201d food in the future. She\u2019s a bit crazy. I don\u2019t agree with people saying you should basically just bend to every whim for her, because to me she seemingly has no real concern or issue that would make it so her kid can\u2019t have those foods, in moderation of course. Parents aren\u2019t always right. If she cares so much about what he eats, she needs to send the food with your nephew every time he visits, or give you money and a guide of what he can eat.", "NTA \n\nThe truth is the truth. She's an almond Mom. She didn't give you explicit guidelines and the kid has no allergies so how could you be the asshole for feeding him good food? Did he drink a gallon of soda? Have a whole pizza to himself? Also, removing you from her sons life will be damaging to him. He can have all the healthy food he wants at Moms house. It's not weird to have pizza at your uncles place. Sounds like sister might have her own eating issues. Approach this topic with care.", "NTA honestly. Being THAT strict in terms of a child\u2019s diet honestly could lead to serious problems like eating disorders. 1 pizza isn\u2019t going to hurt a healthy child and I don\u2019t see the issue with bacon when it\u2019s paired with fruit and an omelette. That seems pretty balanced to me.", "NTA. You took care of him and fed him. It's not like you force-fed him sugar. If she's that concerned about what he eats, then she should actually have a list of what he can eat.", "That kid is going to go off to college and eat all the bad food. You shouldn\u2019t have called her a name but if she\u2019s that strict, she should have given you a guide if it were that important.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s going to give her son a lot of issues surrounding food. It really sucks she\u2019s going to keep him away from you and probably go even harder on her restrictions. I feel bad for him.", "NTA and I snort laughed at \"almond mom\"!", "NTA - Anyone who thinks cauliflower crust pizza is something to feed to children needs their head examined--that stuff is gross.  Your sister is just setting up her son for massive ED issues by making sure he's never allowed to have anything \"fun\" to eat for no other reason than her own obsessive issues with food.  He's going to make a point of eating anything and everything he can get his hands on when he's out of her sight if she keeps treating him like some sort of prisoner having to be punished as far as meals are concerned.", "NTA your sister is hurting the kid more than she helps him. Kids and about everyone should be allowed to have some not so healthy foods at time as long as you don't overdo it. So yeah you were right and she seems to be the one with issues.", "NTA \nthe kid is 11\nif he's got no medical dietary restrictions, he's old enough to decide what he wants to eat. his mom isn't obligated to cook or buy him bacon, but if he's presented with the option then he's old enough to decide that's what he wants to eat.", "> cauliflower crust\n\nWhat? NTA", "NTA\n\nBecause she's never provided a guide or specifically outlawed items, she's jumped the gun on barring you from seeing your nephew. From an ethical perspective, at least, she never advised you what the boundary was nor what the consequences would be for ignoring it.\n\nYou may want to find articles on children who were raised never getting to eat Sweets, and then become obese as adults because all they do is eat the Sweets they couldn't have as a child. Maybe that might help your sister to see the damage she's doing by being so strict uptight and controlling. \n\nModeling good behaviors means showing kids how to eat healthy AND enjoyably. She's gonna give her kids an eating disorder or body dysmorphia if she keeps this up.\n\nOnce she realizes the benefit of all the free labor you've been providing, I'm sure she'll come around...", "NTA I have never heard this term before, but I love it. I grew up like this and trust me, you\u2019re not the only person in this kids life slipping him fun (I hope). His mom is setting him up for some really bad food relationship. I just hope she cools down so the kid can have his uncle back. You sounds like a great uncle", "Nope NTA. eventually he\u2019s not going to be living with her especially if he choose to go to college or even move out at 18 ( which given her behavior will probably happen).  So unless she plans on following him for the rest of his life preparing his food and doing his grocery shopping. \n\nShe\u2019s is sabotaging his relationship with food and his body with her strict habits & increasing his risk for an ED which we all know had life long consequences.", "NTA", "NTA, your sister is absolutely an AH!", "NTA. You aren't a mind reader and your nephew is old enough to speak up for himself.  Your sister is overprotective and it shows.", "Really between ESH and NTA. She should have given you an approved list if she is going to make such a big deal out of what he eats. That being said I am sure you knew she wouldn't approve of pizza or bacon. I think if it was me I would have pushed it with one unhealthy thing but probably not 2. I also think this kind of intense restriction on food options really makes kids miss out. Like when a kid has a birthday is he not allowed the cake or pizza everyone else gets? Everything in moderation is fine and he should be able to experience other foods outside of what she deems as healthy. Kids deserve to enjoy those things and if he has no allergies I don't see the harm in an occasional piece of pizza, bacon or candy.", "Sounds like she is really serious about this and you really didnt treat her concerns seriously. Im not a health nut but you didnt respect her parenting choices even though you knew she wouldnt like it if you got him fast food. If you have a serious conversation and show interest and respect for her boundaries you may get a different reaction. Id say NTA but dont die on this hill.", "Esh. She's being a bit much but I don't think it's right to go behind a parents back with their child. This seems like not a huge deal but you've already now lost overnight privileges. If she can't trust you enough you won't get to see your nephew as much. You need to regain her trust. And once that has been established if you ever let him indulge again leave no evidence leave no witnesses.", "ESH\n\nHer - for never providing the guidelines of how her son has to be fed if you are babysitting him and miraculously expecting you to know her wishes.\n\nYou - for calling her names you obviously intended to be derogatory.", "Soft accidental yta / Nah - sounds like she might (probably) have a ED / severe issues surrounding food and would have flipped at any comment you made in response to explaining why you allowed another human to eat pizza. \n\nI\u2019ve known grandparents to be banned from seeing kids by unless supervised not at their home by the parent because they bought their grandchildren a Happy meal once - pretty sure it was acute anxiety the parent had about food. \n\nCould she sees everything that\u2019s not on her safe list as poison.

If you want to suggest to your sister that she considers widening her son's diet, the time to do that is not after she's spotted you fed her kid something you knew she wouldn't want you to.", "ESH.

Plus no parent has ever been perfect when raising a child. A single phrase is not going to harm and pass on anorexia. The parents that trigger eating disorders are ones that continuous comment on eating and weight/body issues to their children.\n\nPlus focusing on intuitive eating is a preventive measure for eating disorders."]}
