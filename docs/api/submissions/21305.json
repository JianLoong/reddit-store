You\u2019ve been tolerant of their overbearing involvement and their negative commentaries.  SO recognizes this and seems willing to reject their conduct.  SO also seems comfortable confronting you about your conduct and demanding you apologize - important as it shows you aren\u2019t so overdominating in the relationship.  Your confrontation with the in-laws was warranted. They were assholes.   It\u2019s good SO is wiling to freeze you out, but here he is in the wrong.  He should have stood up to them, but clearly isn\u2019t ready.  He may be embarrassed for his failure to do so.  So he\u2019s punishing you.  He\u2019s wrong.  Here,now, he\u2019s an asshole too.", "NTA. \n\nYou did awesome. Don\u2019t sit there and take any crap from them, or let them belittle their son, your partner, in your presence. Well done, lead by example.", "YTA\n\nThis should have come from your husband. He needs to set boundaries with them now and should be straight forward about it.", "NTA. But I really worry about your partner. \n\nThere are some horror stories about this in the various mother in law subs.\n\nIf he had to choose between you and his family, which will he choose?\n\nIf its not you, this is going to get worse, and weirder.\n\nDo you think he will ever stand up to them?\n\nI dont know the answers to these questions, but you should think about them.", "Nta.  So whats the issue. Good riddance.", "NTA. While it\u2019s not great you lost your temper it\u2019s understandable. The parents were ignoring and belittling your knowledge and experience and acting like they knew better about scary Foreignland and Foreigners. \n\nYou are right about the utter lack of respect they are showing to both of you. \n\nA narrow and controlling mindset incapable of understanding that someone - especially a younger female - might actually have knowledge and perspectives worth listening to is also a deeply patronising, ignorant, and disrespectful mindset.  \n\nHowever it\u2019s your husband who needs to break out on his own and stand up to them. He also needs to defend you but he can\u2019t even defend himself currently. He has a long way to go and you may end up on this trip alone.", "ESH.  His parents sound over protective, but I  don't know where you're traveling to and how justified their concerns may be.  You sound quick to poo poo their concerns and were way out of line fighting his battles for him.  If your SO wants his parents to back off, he needs to have that conversation himself.", "A little bit of an ass.  I agree with the poster saying your partner just traded controlling parents for a controlling partner. Do better.", "YTA.  You got angry because his parents didn't respect your knowledge and experience, so you lashed out at them.  His relationship with his parents is between him and his parents.  You butted in, and you do owe his parents an apology.", "YTA. You are not going to change them. You being angry and rude to them is NOT going to change them. All you are accomplishing is venting your own frustration and anger. It doesn't matter if you are 'technically' right when what you said *only caused hurt* \\- and the person who is hurt the worst by this is your PARTNER!  Ideally, your partner should have been the one to speak up for themself. He's an adult and he can fight his own battles. What you did was take an opportunity for your partner to experience, grow from and maybe give his parents something to think about. They were not questioning your adulthood, that wasn't even on their radar - they were wresting with their own mental traumas and anxiety. You twisted it into a fight because of YOUR mental hangs ups, not theirs.  Now your partner is only seeing how rude and hurtful YOU were to the people that he still loves; this chips away at YOUR relationship, and puts him in a position of having to take a side. You may not like where you end up on the scorecard.", "YTA. It seems that your partner exchanged a controlling parents for controlling partner.   You behaviour is no better than his parent's.  This entire trip is your idea and desire and is planned exclusively by you. The explanation that it is because you already traveled does not hold water as you do not need to have traveling experience to select airlines.  More importantly you are clearly interjecting into your partner's relationship with his parent's. Based on this post, your partner hopefully realized that your relationship is unhealthy   and he needs to find someone who treats him as an equal partner.", "I think the tone would be important in this situation. I think there is nothing wrong with politely telling them this information in a conversational tone, but if you raised your voice or used a condescending tone you would be wrong \n\nThese are his parents and it is his place to dictate their relationship not yours.  \n\n You were raised differently and perhaps they believe you were the one \"not raised normally\"  From your description they are super over protective but there is also a thing as being under protective and quite frankly if you are traveling around without a set plan someone having your location sounds like a good idea to me in case you dissappear.", "YTA - not for what you said but for not allowing your husband to handle HIS family. If he chooses to ignore and stick with plans or tell them to shut up is HIS choice. \nYou do need to apologise to them for speaking out of turn and to him for speaking a) for him and b) to his parents rudely.", "NTA but it might have been too abrupt of a break for him to process. You do have a Mona\u2019s boy. Maybe start with smaller trips and build to something bigger? You need to build his confidence in himself first and not a big huge trip for his first outing. Take him to Canada and then some safer places before the big plane ride to SE asia.", "NTA but why, oh why are you sharing any information with them? They cannot criticize what they don't know about. They cannot research and try to scare your partner if they don't know where you're going.\n\nIt's time to edit the information you give them.", "OP is in charge of booking things etc as she has previous experience. Also if you read correctly it was HIS idea that they both go together, she made it clear at the start of them dating that was her plan and he chose to continue the relationship. OP didn't say you needed experience to select airlines? She has clearly used many and would know which is the best value for money etc. I don't think you've actually read this properly.", "Tone is definitely important however the location thing is insane to me.

First, unless you enjoy listening to their hysterics, stop talking with them about the trip. You have almost 2 years before it, a lot can change. Second, before going to the big trip, I'd suggest going to \"test\" trips as soon as possible. I understand money issue, but few days camping trips etc would be worth it.

I would be too, it sounds incredibly neurotic and frustrating! However, there was a better way to handle it than flipping out on them.

YOU need to leave this to him. You can coach him, encourage him, show him different things. But it is not your place to comment on their relationship. HE needs to step up and put his foot down. Your boyfriend is a pushover. He was raised to be a pushover. But he gets to choose how to address his relationship with his parents. It\u2019s probably not a bridge he wants to burn. THE PARENTS have parented like this for a very long time. It\u2019s not going to change over night. It\u2019s pretty clear they have serious anxiety issues. They aren\u2019t helping their son with their behavior- the goal of parenting should be for your children to thrive as individuals.

In fact, they may double down now, and become worse because you're openly challenging them. I have a similar issue with my in-laws. The best way to handle this is to support your partner, keep showing him what it's like to be independent, and that it's OKAY to be independent. Once my spouse realized that, no, it wasn't normal for someone's parents to go through their trash or open their personal mail or insist on doing their taxes for them or impose curfews for an actual adult, he was like HUH. It was like a whole new world of possibilities opened up for him.   \n\n\nWhile I think it's entirely appropriate for you to advocate for yourself and enforce your own boundaries when it comes to their behavior towards you, your partner should be the one handling his relationship with his parents. Otherwise, all he's doing is substituting one type of life manager (his parents) for a different life manager (you) and not actually addressing the underlying issue: his own responsibility. He needs to take responsibility for his happiness, his boundaries, and his wants and needs. He needs to become his own advocate, not roll over and let you be the enforcer for him.", "Wow some of you have never left your hometowns have you? \n\nNTA OP", "nta good on you for standing your ground. the parents are a bit much", "[deleted]", "[removed]", "We have travelled together before but it was week or two long trips, last summer we went to Portugal, left our phones in the hotel room cause we just wanted a quick swim before going out for lunch and his mother rang the hotel and asked if there was a lifeguard on duty.", "I agree the every 2 days is a lot but I have a brother studying in Germany, another in Brazil and a sister working in Poland so its easier for my mother to just look at WhatsApp and say yep heard from them all recently, they're fine - it works lol", "You might be downvoted for this but you are SPOT.

Her own SO is mad about it. These aren\u2019t level-headed people; they\u2019ve raised their child to be sheltered and afraid of things in the same way they are.

Behind close doors he can mention that he thinks you were wrong but under no circumstances should he ever say that in front of his parents.  All that said, he needs to be the one to confront his parents about boundaries that need to be in place, you can\u2019t do that for him.
