He comes from a very close and IMO overprotective family, he was basically treated like fine china and not allowed to do anything, he couldn't swim or ride a bike until I showed him because his mother thinks it is dangerous. I was raised by a laidback family, who encouraged me to try anything and do everything. We travelled a lot during my childhood, and in 2016 I went abroad to travel and work, coming home during lockdown. When we started dating I explained that I was home due to the pandemic and intended to set out to travel again when possible, my partner agreed and understood but as we became more serious he suggested we save money for a few years and then go together. We are currently on track with our savings goal and plan to leave mid 2025.\n\nMy partner is slowly figuring out the way he was raised is not normal, and starting to discover himself, I am incredibly proud of him. He is still in contact with his parents but now we have our own home, they aren't as involved (they wanted us to move to the same town as them but I swiftly put my foot down on that, as did my he). We told his parents, and they are being incredibly neurotic. I understand they are looking out for his safety, my own mother has a rule that she must receive a text or phone call from me at least every 2 days. I am in charge of organising the majority of the trip, booking flights and arranging accommodation as I have been to most of the places we are planning to go. They criticise the airlines I choose, they bring up news stories from the places years ago, they requested he share his location with them 24/7. I explained the outline of the counties we plan to visit, but nothing is certain as plans change and you enjoy some places more than others etc. When we mentioned certain cities they researched them and freaked out because they're 'dangerous' and we will be 'murdered or kidnapped immediately'. I have explained several times that those cities are ones I know very well, having spent months there and have friends living there also. They wouldn't relent about it. I finally cracked and told them to stop trying to micromanage and control him, and not accepting he has his own life now. I pointed out that the county they live in has had several murders in the past few years and an armed robbery not even two days ago. People get hurt everywhere and we are just as likely to get hurt at home as we are in the middle of southeast Asia. They were shocked and said nothing, just stared at me as I got my coat and went out to the car, my partner followed me and told me I needed to go and apologise, I said nope. They show no respect for him as an individual and none for me as a knowledgeable and experienced adult. He went back in the house and said goodbye, we drove home in silence and now it's the next day and he will not speak to me.

Changed verdict", "You aren\u2019t wrong, but this needed to come from your SO, not you. If he won\u2019t put his foot down and create his own boundaries, he\u2019s a part of the problem. They don\u2019t care what you think; they care about him, and if boundaries are ever going to be enforced, he needs to grow a spine.", "I'll go ESH\n\nprobably get downvoted to hell and back but ..\n\n1. You - this is between him and his parents.  He needs to grow a back bone and stand up to his parents.  However with all this  you don't know if there is any reason behind their behaviour - yes they may be helicopter parents but they also may be reacting to something traumatic in their past and need therapy.  I only say this because I had a sibling abducted in front of me when I was a child.  It still has an effect on me and one I have to watch out for so as to not be too overprotective to my own children.\n2. Him - he needs to set the ground rules with his parents and establish his boundaries. If he keeps letting them stomp all over his boundaries nothing will get better.\n3. His Parents - they need to work out their baby boy has grown and support him in his life not try to run his life as if he is still a child.  Parents are suppose to equip their children with the skills they need to grow up and face the world on their own.", "NTA\n\nBe carefull and go forward as long you feel it as OK for you.\n\nI wish you good luck.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You\u2019ve been tolerant of their overbearing involvement and their negative commentaries.  SO recognizes this and seems willing to reject their conduct.  SO also seems comfortable confronting you about your conduct and demanding you apologize - important as it shows you aren\u2019t so overdominating in the relationship.  Your confrontation with the in-laws was warranted. They were assholes.   It\u2019s good SO is wiling to freeze you out, but here he is in the wrong.  He should have stood up to them, but clearly isn\u2019t ready.  He may be embarrassed for his failure to do so.  So he\u2019s punishing you.  He\u2019s wrong.  Here,now, he\u2019s an asshole too.", "NTA. \n\nYou did awesome. Don\u2019t sit there any take any crap from them, or let them belittle their son, your partner, in your presence. Well done, lead by example.", "YTA\n\nThis should have come from your husband. He needs to set boundaries with them now and should be straight forward about it.", "NTA. But I really worry about your partner. \n\nThere are some horror stories about this in the various mother in law subs.\n\nIf he had to choose between you and his family, which will he choose?\n\nIf its not you, this is going to get worse, and weirder.\n\nDo you think he will ever stand up to them?\n\nI dont know the answers to these questions, but you should think about them.", "Nta.  So whats the issue. Good riddance.", "NTA. While it\u2019s not great you lost your temper it\u2019s understandable. The parents were ignoring and belittling your knowledge and experience and acting like they knew better about scary Foreignland and Foreigners. \n\nYou are right about the utter lack of respect they are showing to both of you. \n\nA narrow and controlling mindset incapable of understanding that someone - especially a younger female - might actually have knowledge and perspectives worth listening to is also a deeply patronising, ignorant, and disrespectful mindset.  \n\nHowever it\u2019s your husband who needs to break out on his own and stand up to them. He also needs to defend you but he can\u2019t even defend himself currently. He has a long way to go and you may end up on this trip alone.", "ESH.  His parents sound over protective, but I  don't know where you're traveling to and how justified their concerns may be.  You sound quick to poo poo their concerns and were way out of line fighting his battles for him.  If your SO wants his parents to back off, he needs to have that conversation himself.", "A little bit of an ass.  I agree with the poster saying your partner just traded controlling parents for a controlling partner. Do better.", "YTA.  You got angry because his parents didn't respect your knowledge and experience, so you lashed out at them.  His relationship with his parents is between him and his parents.  You butted in, and you do owe his parents an apology.", "YTA. You are not going to change them. You being angry and rude to them is NOT going to change them. All you are accomplishing is venting your own frustration and anger. It doesn't matter if you are 'technically' right when what you said *only caused hurt* \\- and the person who is hurt the worst by this is your PARTNER!  Ideally, your partner should have been the one to speak up for themself. He's an adult and he can fight his own battles. What you did was take an opportunity for your partner to experience, grow from and maybe give his parents something to think about. They were not questioning your adulthood, that wasn't even on their radar - they were wresting with their own mental traumas and anxiety. You twisted it into a fight because of YOUR mental hangs ups, not theirs.  Now your partner is only seeing how rude and hurtful YOU were to the people that he still loves; this chips away at YOUR relationship, and puts him in a position of having to take a side. You may not like where you end up on the scorecard.", "YTA. It seems that your partner exchanged a controlling parents for controlling partner.   You behaviour is no better than his parent's.  This entire trip is your idea and desire and is planned exclusively by you. The explanation that it is because you already traveled does not hold water as you do not need to have traveling experience to select airlines.  More importantly you are clearly interjecting into your partner's relationship with his parent's. Based on this post, your partner hopefully realized that your relationship is unhealthy   and he needs to find someone who treats him as an equal partner.", "I think the tone would be important in this situation. I think there is nothing wrong with politely telling them this information in a conversational tone, but if you raised your voice or used a condescending tone you would be wrong \n\nThese are his parents and it is his place to dictate their relationship not yours.  \n\n You were raised differently and perhaps they believe you were the one \"not raised normally\"  From your description they are super over protective but there is also a thing as being under protective and quite frankly if you are traveling around without a set plan someone having your location sounds like a good idea to me in case you dissappear.", "YTA - not for what you said but for not allowing your husband to handle HIS family. If he chooses to ignore and stick with plans or tell them to shut up is HIS choice. \nYou do need to apologise to them for speaking out of turn and to him for speaking a) for him and b) to his parents rudely.", "NTA but it might have been too abrupt of a break for him to process. You do have a Mona\u2019s boy. Maybe start with smaller trips and build to something bigger? You need to build his confidence in himself first and not a big huge trip for his first outing. Take him to Canada and then some safer places before the big plane ride to SE asia.", "NTA but why, oh why are you sharing any information with them? They cannot criticize what they don't know about. They cannot research and try to scare your partner if they don't know where you're going.\n\nIt's time to edit the information you give them.", "OP is in charge of booking things etc as she has previous experience. Also if you read correctly it was HIS idea that they both go together, she made it clear at the start of them dating that was her plan and he chose to continue the relationship. OP didn't say you needed experience to select airlines? She has clearly used many and would know which is the best value for money etc. I don't think you've actually read this properly.", "Tone is definitely important however the location thing is insane to me. Sending a text saying we are in x city and staying in x hotel is more than suffice. His parents don't need to know everytime they go to a Starbucks.", "We have trips planned this August (one week) and October (three weeks) for the next countries over (we share a border with a few), and in January next year we have a road trip organised with some friends for throughout our country.", "They could share location with anyone imo. It doesn't have to be his parents if his parents are likely to check it every 5 minutes. But let his parents (and hers) know who they have it shared with so if they go radio silent someone can tell the authorities their last known location", "Does he wanna go on that many trips?"]}
