Because our family is so big, we usually take turns hosting things like birthdays and holidays so we don't end up relying on one person to always open their house for celebrations. \r  \n\r  \nWell, my older sister, Joan (41F), has a son (Mac) who's turning 11 this year, and I adore my nephew, so I decided to volunteer to host it this time. It was going well enough until yesterday, when I was babysitting Joan's kids and decided to take the opportunity to ask Mac what he wanted his birthday to be like. \n\n\r  \nDuring this his 9 year old sister, Dani, decided it would be a fun game to remove my insulin from the fridge and hide it. Apparently, this was something Dani had been doing regularly at home, but Joan found it funny and didn't think to correct her or to at least warn me ahead of time. What resulted was a good 40 minutes of me tearing apart my kitchen in a panic. \n\n\r  \nI ended up backing out of hosting the party, since I didn't want Dani around my things until she grew out of the phase (especially since my house is full of important medications), but when I told Joan she blew up.\n\n\r  \nShe was calling me selfish and saying that no harm was actually done since my insulin didn't expire and I found it within the hour, but that's not the point. The point is that I need that insulin to survive and I don't feel comfortable knowing that there's someone in my house who'd find it funny to hide it from me.\n\n\r  \nI tried compromising and agreeing to still host as long as Dani is always being watched, but Joan said she didn't want her daughter to be made to feel like a prisoner at her own brother's bday, and that she hoped i was happy with ruining Mac's bday over a petty feud with a child.\n\n\r  \nNow Joan is refusing to talk to me, and some of my siblings are telling me that I could've just hosted the party and had them help me find my things after instead of making a big deal over it, and I'm seriously starting to doubt myself here.

No. No! **NTA!**\n\nShe is 9 years old and she's not going to \"grow out of it.\" She's probably a thief, too. Her behavior is not funny, it is not cute and it is not acceptable. Your sister \"ruined\" the kid's party because she is the one allowing that behavior to go unpunished. I've never heard of a kid doing something like that before and I sure as hell wouldn't have that nonsense in my house. My things belong exactly where I put them, most especially in my own house. No guest in the house has any business screwing around with my stuff like that kid does with yours. I wouldn't have that and you should not have to put up with it, either.", "NTA you need insulin to live and it shouldn't be carried around by a child anyway. Your sister is the A.", "NTA, but your sister is and she's raising another one.  Any child of mine stealing and hiding insulin gets an age-appropriate lecture on why that's bad and dangerous and to never ever do that again.  If they're old enough to know better, especially if they know what insulin is and why it's dangerous to take it, they stay home from OP's house until they can be trusted, even if I have to miss the party to stay home with her.    Taking medication people need to live isn't funny or cute and will not be tolerated.", "NTA and your sister is an idiot", "No more hosting events where Joan and Dani are until they acknowledge what was done was dangerous. This also goes for the siblings who also saw nothing wrong with what Dani and Joan did.\n\nAlso, person who has children should he responsible for \"opening up their house for celebrations\" involving their children. I think your family rule should only apply for parents' birthdays and then general holidays. Birthdays specific to siblings or to their nuclear family members, should be held at their own homes. That is if parents won't take responsibility for what their children do. And other siblings support them. \n\nNTA\n\nEdited.", "Let me get this straight:  the girl takes life-saving medication out of the fridge & hides it, and her mother thinks it's FUNNY?  9 years old is well old enough to know what she is doing is wrong, and dangerous, but I don't see her learning this lesson while her mother is enabling this behaviour.  \n\nNTA - and the siblings are making you doubt yourself can just host the party themselves - you know, since apparently nothing is a 'big deal'.  What a bunch of ~~wan~~ .... wombles.", "NTA. Your sister is a moron.", "9 is old enough to know better. Both niece and sister are AH\n\nNTA - ask your nephew if he fancies a fun day 1-1 with his uncle for his birthday", "OP has long as parents refuse to discipline their children and not educate them between right and wrong, which a 9 y/o is not too young to learn and just making excuses for their laziness to do it, then you have nothing to feel bad about.  Just ignore the negativity because karma will eventually come back to her and when it does she'll hopefully learn her lesson.  You know yourself that you wouldn't have been able to get away with that when you were her age by your family growing up so just remind your siblings of the same thing.", "NTA but I would start only referring to the incident as \u201cDani trying to kill me\u201d. \n\nAny one of your family who think you shouldn\u2019t cancel the party: \u201ci am not comfortable being around a 9 year old child who is trying to kill me, or the adults who make out that it\u2019s not a big deal\u201d. \n\nAssuming I\u2019m right that your insulin is potentially life saving, if the worst circumstances occur?", "NTA If your sister can't promise to keep an eye on her daughter, knowing her daughter will do it, then they shouldn't be in your house.

Mac is probably tired of her anyway, she probably pulls this stuff all of the time and mom backs her.", "NTA, a 9 year old is old enough to understand that you don\u2019t touch other peoples property especially medication with approval from the owner of whatever it is. Your sister is the AH for not teaching her daughter to stop touching and taking things that don\u2019t belong to her. Both my husband and I are diabetics, he is on insulin and it\u2019s important for him to take his insulin at certain times or his blood sugars spike to much.

That\u2019s beyond absurd and entitled. 110% NTA OP, it\u2019s honestly baffling that she had the audacity to say that you were overreacting about nearly **dying**.", "NTA your sister is the major AH for her attitude.   Lack of insulin could kill you.   Hiding it is not a joke and 9 is way too old to think it is funny to jeopardize someone's life.   Her mom needs to start parenting and quit being a jerk.", "NTA, and I would be very very concerned over this kid taking the other meds and either eating them or feeding them to another child or adult. There are no boundaries being set. I\u2019ve had to lock bedroom doors because a nephew of mine would let his kids rummage through guest bedrooms during extended family visits. We won\u2019t even mention liability. I wholeheartedly advocate locking a room and keeping it off-limits in case you want to host the party. Get a cooler and ice, and put your meds in there, and lock it away any time this child is in your home. She will not grow out of this.", "NTA.
