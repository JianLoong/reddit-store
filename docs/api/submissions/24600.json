Apparently, this was something Dani had been doing regularly at home, but Joan found it funny and didn't think to correct her or to at least warn me ahead of time. What resulted was a good 40 minutes of me tearing apart my kitchen in a panic. \n\n\r  \nI ended up backing out of hosting the party, since I didn't want Dani around my things until she grew out of the phase (especially since my house is full of important medications), but when I told Joan she blew up.\n\n\r  \nShe was calling me selfish and saying that no harm was actually done since my insulin didn't expire and I found it within the hour, but that's not the point. The point is that I need that insulin to survive and I don't feel comfortable knowing that there's someone in my house who'd find it funny to hide it from me.\n\n\r  \nI tried compromising and agreeing to still host as long as Dani is always being watched, but Joan said she didn't want her daughter to be made to feel like a prisoner at her own brother's bday, and that she hoped i was happy with ruining Mac's bday over a petty feud with a child.\n\n\r  \nNow Joan is refusing to talk to me, and some of my siblings are telling me that I could've just hosted the party and had them help me find my things after instead of making a big deal over it, and I'm seriously starting to doubt myself here.
