I had the idea to throw her a surprise puppy shower, the same way you would a baby shower. The whole family was enthralled, it was a beautiful celebration, and she got everything a new pup would need + a cash gift to help with vets and registration etc.\n\nAbout a month ago, Olivia and her husband/my brother announced that they too were getting a puppy.

He had reiterated Olivia\u2019s feelings - they just expected what was done for one should be done for all. I explained that Nina\u2019s situation is obviously different (and no one throws a puppy shower in normal circumstances), to which he retorted that I have no idea why they don\u2019t have kids and Olivia could have fertility issues too for all I know.\n\nSo, AITA for not throwing Olivia a puppy shower? I did concede that I don\u2019t know why they don\u2019t have kids, but her and I nor my brother are close so I wouldn\u2019t ask about it unless she volunteered. It honestly feels like they\u2019re using the possibility of infertility as a guilt trip, but then I feel awful for even thinking that as I have no idea and know secondhand through Nina how hard it is.

The puppy shower you organized for Nina was a unique and special celebration because of her specific circumstances regarding infertility. It was a way for your family to support and celebrate her decision to adopt a puppy as a way of embracing motherhood.\r  \n\r  \nWhile it's understandable that Olivia may have felt left out or overlooked, it is important to recognize the context and significance behind Nina's puppy shower. Olivia's decision to get a puppy doesn't necessarily warrant the same level of celebration, especially if she hasn't expressed any particular desire for a puppy shower herself. Additionally, the fact that she has bio sisters who could potentially have been involved in celebrating her decision further diminishes any obligation for you to take on that responsibility.\r  \n\r  \nIt's unfortunate that Olivia and your brother are using the possibility of infertility as a guilt trip to justify their expectations. Infertility is a sensitive issue, and assuming that Olivia may have fertility issues without any indication from her is unfair. You should not feel obligated to fulfill these expectations based on speculation.\r  \n\r  \nIt might be worth discussing the situation with Olivia directly to understand her perspective and clarify any misunderstandings. However, it is ultimately your choice whether or not to organize a puppy shower for her.", "NTA, you did something nice as a one-time thing, no one would expect you to do it for every puppy someone gets.", "NTA. The puppy shower wasn\u2019t really about the puppy. It was about Nina\u2019s general situation and a touching gesture recognizing her struggles.", "NTA they're just looking to take advantage and get free stuff.", "NTA. If Olivia has had problems trying to be a mother then maybe your brother should have communicated this. You\u2019re not a mind reader.", "NTA the situation isn't the same period.

Who in normal circumstances \" announces\" getting a puppy. They did and hoped you'd get their hint.", "Nta. Even if you through your sister a baby shower and then sil got pregnant, it\u2019s wouldn\u2019t be your job to through her one.", "NTA. No one told you, Olivia would expect a puppy shower. It was a really nice idea for your sister in her situation. And I think you told Oliver or at least the whole family knew, why you made the puppy shower for Nina.\n\nSo if Olivia would have expected something simular, because of what reason what so ever, someone should have told you. Maybe your brother could have ask discrete, like 'hey, sorry for asking. But we are getting a puppy too and just wanted to know, if you will throw us a party too. No pressure just don't want to buy things for our puppy, if something is planed.' They could have also told Olivias sisters about the puppy shower for Nina with some hints, that they would expect something from them.\n\nBut no. No normal person would expect a puppy shower, just because you throw one for your sister. So NTA.", "NTA.  You said it yourself, Nina was struggling with infertility and her and her husband are trying but it's exhausting.  You did a puppy shower just to celebrate Nina more than the puppy cause she's handling the strain in a healthy manner.  Olivia just wants a normal and is a double standard scenario.  She's in belief that she's entitled to one cause she also got a puppy.  Unless hee fertility is the reason why, I don't see how she isn't an AH.  If anything, I'm the shower for Nina was a one off just to help celebrate your sister during her struggles in this time.", "Wait, are puppy showers a thing? I didn\u2019t get one? Should I be extremely offended?", "NTA, If she wanted a puppy shower so bad, she could've asked or organised it herself, especially because you aren't too close to her. She even has biological sisters, so it really isn't your responsibility at all to throw her one.\n\nI agree that it is a completely different reason that the puppy shower was thrown for Nina and it had a bigger significance than Olivia's reason (based on provided information). Also, Olivia should have expected she needed to buy necessities for a puppy and her utter lack of regard is slightly concerning. I hope she wasn't doing this to seek attention from the rest of the family and expect to be showered in praise and gifts, forgetting she had an actual puppy to look after (speculation, nothing more).", "NTA   your brother and SIL probably wanted the attention and gifts is only reason they even Got the puppy.  Your SIL basically confessed as much when she wasn't prepared for the puppy s needs.  If a person makes the decision to get a puppy, they normally do so because they desire the companionship, and they make the appropriate related purchases during the process of adopting a pet.  It wouldn't even cross someone's mind to expect someone else to foot the tab for a shower, Unless the shower was the primary motivation for the whole idea", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Ignore them if they bring it up again. It\u2019s none of their business", "NTA. Puppy showers are not a thing as far as I know.", "NTA", "Eh, soft nah. OP isn't obligated to throw a puppy shower (no one is) and brother/sil can feel hurt, since it is okay for people to feel what they feel. It's not clear if they knew the infertility backstory as deeply as OP did, so there's a chance they didn't fully understand why the original puppy shower.even happened.", "Poor dog. She\u2019s trying to one-up Nina and just like you said, she\u2019s horribly underprepared.", "I'd rather attend a puppy shower than a baby shower personally.", "Amen to this.\n\nIt feels like a cash grab. The same way some people invite folks to their wedding solely for the present.\n\nI got puppies last year as a family acquaintance had a huge unplanned litter. Free to adopt.  BUT puppies are expensive. First couple rounds of vet visits involved getting them all their vaccinations, chipping, and eventually spaying. That's like $1k all together. Inlaws actually paid for it all since they had encouraged us adopting more than 1.\n\nYou don't go into getting a pet expecting others to pay for stuff.  All the money we saved on vet visits went straight into an account for future emergencies for pets specifically.", "I guess you want to know so you can support Olivia the way you supported your other sister.", "This is a stolen comment.", "Yeah I emailed my vets months in advance to get an estimate on puppy shots when we started looking, she\u2019s going to be very unprepared.", "Right? I love dogs more than anything, and would never attend/throw/ask for a puppy shower (might make an exception for attending in a situation like Nina's, but that's more about moral support).", "I just want to say, a puppy shower sounds weird and needs to become more mainstream.", "Nina is OP's sister, who she is very close to. Olivia is OP's SIL. \n\nNo one is obligated to throw anyone any type of shower, puppy or baby. OP did a puppy shower out of kindness and her SIL seemed to wanted to have one given to her for gifts. Take everyone's uterus out of the equation, OP is NTA.", "That's kinda how my family chat is as well. We all live a bit of a distance from each other so it's a nice way to have a general chit chat. Last message this morning was my sibling telling me what bargains they got at their local carboot.", "You\u2019re right let\u2019s not talk about uteruses. I don\u2019t know why Partassipant brought them up in the first place.", "Right?! For the love of God, THINK OF THE ANIMALS", "I didn't. OP's sister in law is the AH because she seemed to want the gifts from a shower, OP isn't close to her brothers wife.\n\nOP mentioned her sisters infertility because she is very close to her sister and have confided in her, women are allowed to do that if they please. They are allowed to reach out for support. It also is one of the reasons why she threw a puppy shower, she is celebrating a new life that is being added to her sisters family."]}
