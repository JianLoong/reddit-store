If they wanted one they should have asked or THROWN THEIR OWN", "NTA \r  \n\r  \nYou are not obligated to throw a puppy shower for Olivia, especially since puppy showers are not a common practice. The puppy shower you organized for Nina was a unique and special celebration because of her specific circumstances regarding infertility. It was a way for your family to support and celebrate her decision to adopt a puppy as a way of embracing motherhood.\r  \n\r  \nWhile it's understandable that Olivia may have felt left out or overlooked, it is important to recognize the context and significance behind Nina's puppy shower. Olivia's decision to get a puppy doesn't necessarily warrant the same level of celebration, especially if she hasn't expressed any particular desire for a puppy shower herself. Additionally, the fact that she has bio sisters who could potentially have been involved in celebrating her decision further diminishes any obligation for you to take on that responsibility.\r  \n\r  \nIt's unfortunate that Olivia and your brother are using the possibility of infertility as a guilt trip to justify their expectations. Infertility is a sensitive issue, and assuming that Olivia may have fertility issues without any indication from her is unfair. You should not feel obligated to fulfill these expectations based on speculation.\r  \n\r  \nIt might be worth discussing the situation with Olivia directly to understand her perspective and clarify any misunderstandings. However, it is ultimately your choice whether or not to organize a puppy shower for her.", "NTA, you did something nice as a one-time thing, no one would expect you to do it for every puppy someone gets.", "NTA. The puppy shower wasn\u2019t really about the puppy. It was about Nina\u2019s general situation and a touching gesture recognizing her struggles.", "NTA they're just looking to take advantage and get free stuff.", "NTA. If Olivia has had problems trying to be a mother then maybe your brother should have communicated this. You\u2019re not a mind reader.", "NTA the situation isn't the same period.

Who in normal circumstances \" announces\" getting a puppy. They did and hoped you'd get their hint.", "Nta. Even if you through your sister a baby shower and then sil got pregnant, it\u2019s wouldn\u2019t be your job to through her one.", "NTA. No one told you, Olivia would expect a puppy shower. It was a really nice idea for your sister in her situation. And I think you told Oliver or at least the whole family knew, why you made the puppy shower for Nina.\n\nSo if Olivia would have expected something simular, because of what reason what so ever, someone should have told you. Maybe your brother could have ask discrete, like 'hey, sorry for asking. But we are getting a puppy too and just wanted to know, if you will throw us a party too. No pressure just don't want to buy things for our puppy, if something is planed.' They could have also told Olivias sisters about the puppy shower for Nina with some hints, that they would expect something from them.\n\nBut no. No normal person would expect a puppy shower, just because you throw one for your sister. So NTA.", "NTA.  You said it yourself, Nina was struggling with infertility and her and her husband are trying but it's exhausting.  You did a puppy shower just to celebrate Nina more than the puppy cause she's handling the strain in a healthy manner.  Olivia just wants a normal and is a double standard scenario.  She's in belief that she's entitled to one cause she also got a puppy.  Unless hee fertility is the reason why, I don't see how she isn't an AH.  If anything, I'm the shower for Nina was a one off just to help celebrate your sister during her struggles in this time.", "Wait, are puppy showers a thing? I didn\u2019t get one? Should I be extremely offended?", "NTA, If she wanted a puppy shower so bad, she could've asked or organised it herself, especially because you aren't too close to her. She even has biological sisters, so it really isn't your responsibility at all to throw her one.\n\nI agree that it is a completely different reason that the puppy shower was thrown for Nina and it had a bigger significance than Olivia's reason (based on provided information). Also, Olivia should have expected she needed to buy necessities for a puppy and her utter lack of regard is slightly concerning. I hope she wasn't doing this to seek attention from the rest of the family and expect to be showered in praise and gifts, forgetting she had an actual puppy to look after (speculation, nothing more).", "NTA   your brother and SIL probably wanted the attention and gifts is only reason they even Got the puppy.  Your SIL basically confessed as much when she wasn't prepared for the puppy s needs.  If a person makes the decision to get a puppy, they normally do so because they desire the companionship, and they make the appropriate related purchases during the process of adopting a pet.  It wouldn't even cross someone's mind to expect someone else to foot the tab for a shower, Unless the shower was the primary motivation for the whole idea", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
