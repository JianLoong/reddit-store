I haven't dated anyone since becoming a single parent as I didn't really have the time or energy for it. But now that my daughter is a teenager I started dating again and I've been with my current girlfriend for 6 months. She's also a single parent, she has a son around the same age as my daughter. We don't live together yet, we decided to take things slow because of the kids but she does spend most weekends at my place. \n\nNow to the topic of this post, my daughter has really long hair. I've been washing her hair since she was little. Now that she's older I've tried to teach her to wash it herself but she still calls me in every time as she can't wash it properly herself. I don't have an issue with that as I've been doing it for years. But my girlfriend has an issue with this. We recently had a conversation about this and she said she thinks it would be better if she was the one to wash her hair since she's a woman. I told her that I don't think my daughter would be comfortable with that but I told her I'd ask her. Which I did, and she said that she doesn't want anyone else washing her hair except me. So that's what I told my girlfriend. But somehow this turned into a fight, and my girlfriend has been mad at me ever since. And I honestly don't know what to think about this whole thing.

You\u2019ve been with your girlfriend for 6 months and she wants to be the one to help your naked daughter, even though your daughter doesn\u2019t want her help. I understand that your daughter is old enough to wash her hair alone, but the way commenters are sexualizing your relationship with her and calling it creepy is weird. \n\nESH - take your daughter to a professional to teach her how to manage her hair and gain more independence. Tell your girlfriend to respect your daughter\u2019s decisions.", "Nta \ud83d\ude2dyour daughter is tho", "Is she naked and in shower or bath because that's the vibe I'm getting if so YTA, at that age you should be nowhere near your naked daughter. She should know how to wash her own hair at this age, if not then she'll need to restyle it. I really hope I'm wrong about her being naked, your daughter needs privacy ffs", "I don't think anyone's an arsehole here. \n\nBut I do find the situation with you washing your 15 year old hair consistently very VERY strange. And I'm assuming your partner does too and she's just tried to find a polite and accommodating way around it by offering to wash your daughters hair.\n\nHonestly at this age your daughter should be able to manage this much by herself and if her hair is really so long that she's unable to wash it herself then she should have it cut. What are you planning on doing when she goes away for college or on a holiday with friends or moves out in any way??\n\nQualifications:\nI've had thick, curly hair down to my buttcrack since I was about 10 and always managed fine by myself. Hell of an arm workout but it's fine.", "Your daughter says she wants you to help her out.\n\nBut how old is your kid ? And is she naked when you go into the bathroom ?\n\nEDIT : YTA.\n\nThe kid is 15 and naked. This needs to stop. She can wash her hair herself and if it's too long, time to consider \u00e0 haircut.", "No assholes here.\n\n\nJust curious though, OP are you going to be washing your daughters hair after she turns 18? That's only three short years away.\n\n\nAnd why can't your daughter wash her hair by herself? Does she have physical or mental issues? Self care is an extremely important life skill.\n\n\nMaybe she just really enjoys the way dad washes her hair and it makes her happy. But seriously at some point she *Needs To Learn How to take care of Herself.*\n\n\nShorter hair might be a suitable option?", "YTA. You\u2019re being a creep.\n\nJust as an FYI, my **5 year old** can at least partly do her own hair. She\u2019s still getting the hang of it, but she\u2019s trying. \n\nThere is no way in hell I\u2019m managing it when she\u2019s 15.", "Wow at all the comments sexualizing this situation. Why would you see something sexual in a father washing his daughter\u2019s hair but wouldn\u2019t mind a mother doing the same? \nTo the original poster: NTA but you should consider some solutions to help your daughter be more independent. Washing long hair is hard but a 15yo should be learning how to do it. If she can\u2019t manage, then maybe she should consider cutting it a bit shorter. Because there will be moments when you\u2019re not available to wash her hair", "NTA. It sounds like this is a bonding thing between you and your daughter and she doesn\u2019t want to let go of that. Maybe more so because you have a new girlfriend and she needs to hang on to childhood routines a bit.\nI don\u2019t agree that family can never see each other naked, that is gross sexualization of the body IMO. But I suggest she learns to wash her hair herself.\nYour girlfriend is TA for turning this into a fight. It is not really her business.", "The amount of people turning this sexual is discouraging. Nudity is not automatically a sexual thing. If a family is at a nudist colony, are they all sexual perverts? That being said, a teenager should know how to wash her own hair, so YTA for that part of things.", "If your daughter is a teenager she needs to wash her own hair. If she is not clothed you should not be in that room.

Are you out of your mind?", "YTA! Your daughter is 15, it's high time that she should learn to wash her hair.\n\nThis is very weird and concerning. And also you are the asshole for not teaching your teenager the basic principles to follow for hygiene. Start now or it will be too late.", "What the actual hell. YTA.", "YTA\nShe is almost the same age as you when you had her. And you still wash her hair?!", "YTA YOUR 15 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER IS NAKED WHEN YOU WASH HER HAIR? Wtf did I just read?\n\nShe\u2019s 15. That\u2019s inappropriate AF. And don\u2019t tell me a 15 year old cannot wash her own hair. That\u2019s complete bullshit.", "How is her hair washed ? In a sink or while showering", "YTA for not teaching a 15 year old how to wash her hair without someone else\u2019s help. It\u2019s really weird you help her when she\u2019s naked in the shower and time to call it quits", "At 15 she should be able to wash her own hair. If she wants help, then at this ppt, it should be on the basis that she is washing her hair by using a shower attachment and leaning over the bath, which allows her to wash it while fully clothed.\n\nMaybe you can still help by drying her hair so you get that father / daughter time where she feels you are helping and nurturing her. What specifically does she need help with? Until recently I had my (exceptionally thick) hair down to my hips, and it was like tht when I was in my late teens - I have never had ay issue washing it without help. Doe syour daughter have a disability that means she can't do this for hersef? F so, then you need to start looking at ways of her being able to have help which don't mean she is undressed while it's happening\n\nHowever, having someone else comb / dry or braid it can be very soothing and when I lived at home I loved having my dad do it. \n\nWhen I read your post, I assumed tht she was 6 or 7 .\n\nWhile I am a very strong believer that nudity =/ = sexual it's importnat for her as a teenager to learn normal boundaries, and part of that it that if you are naked and bathing then you do that alone.\n\nTalk to your daughter. Let her know she is old enough that she needs to learn to wash her hair herself, but suggest tat once it is clean and she is dressed (PJs or a dressing gown counting as dressed) you are happy to help her dry it / style it whatever, and in the short term, your partner is willing to help her to wash it if she really struggles.", "Is she clothed and sticking her head under the kitchen tap or bathtub tap (from outside the bath) when you wash her hair?

It's time for your sorry butt to say no next time she asks. She needs to learn on her own what you FAILED to teach her. OMFG, this poor girl.", "nta. some folks need to understand that not every family or every culture is squeamish about nudity. not everyone immediately assumes that nudity is automatically sexual. maybe she just likes the ritual and the bonding time together. if neither person actually involved is uncomfortable or doing anything inappropriate, then I don't see a problem with the hair washing. it's pretty a pretty big overstep for op's girlfriend to try to get in the way of what sounds like a bonding activity, especially without talking to the daughter first.", "NAH, but your daughter really should be able to wash her own hair by the age of fifteen.\n\nIt's not creepy for you to be helping her, but she *needs* to learn to do it herself. She'll potentially be moving away in less than three years, what is she going to so then?\n\nIt's totally fine that she prefers you to do it compared to your girlfriend, but dude, she should be capable of washing her own hair at this point.", "YTA. Because this level of dependency is absolutely dysfunctional. But the questions are numerous.\n\nHow do you come about having a teenager that needs physical help washing their own hair? \n\nAnd why are you complying with this need for assistance? \n\nHow do you parent by including the action of washing the equivalent of an adults hair? \n\nHow do you even have an SO that is offering to take your place? \n\nI\u2019d be so baffled that I\u2019d run for the hills\u2026", "ESH. if your daughter is a teenager (13+), she should learn to wash her own hair. This isn\u2019t something you can go your life without learning. She needs to learn how to properly wash her hair, and if she can\u2019t take care of her hair because of the length, then cut it. If you don\u2019t want to cut it, then teach her how to wash it. Your gf sucks because it\u2019s weird that she wants to wash your daughter\u2019s hair when she\u2019s only been in this girl\u2019s life for 6 months\u2026 That\u2019s a weird solution to this problem. Teach your daughter how to wash her long hair and then this problem will be solved.", "I don't want to be that person, but maybe your gf is thinking more is happening than just hair washing? I mean, you're both alone in the shower together, I'm assuming you get naked to get in the shower too.... That is just weird\n\nYes, YTA for not seeing how weird that is", "Sorry Dad, it's time for your daughter to learn to manage her own hair. Take her to a salon and ask the stylist to show her how to wash, dry, and style her hair and what products and tools are right for her. I totally understand dealing with long hair can be difficult, my daughter is tri-racial with amazing long hair, now that she's a Mom she goes to the salon for a blowout rather than wrestle with it. NAH because your intentions are good.", "YTA for not teaching basic hygiene.  She\u2019s a teenager and should either wash her own hair or cut it.

Red flag.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019ve been scrolling the comments and saw your daughter is naked when you wash her hair. I thought it was washing her hair over the bath or something\u2026 I think this is a bit odd given her age. She should really learn how to wash her own hair. \n\nESH.", "This has a very creepy vibe. I'm sure it didn't get here maliciously, but this behavior needs to stop. Washing her hair isn't necessarily a sexual thing, but anyone you tell about this will immediately assume it is to some extent. It also implies a degree of learned helplessness on her part you need to address.\n\nThere is a line somewhere between being a good parent and where you are now, which isn't ok. I don't know exactly at what age that is, but you have definitely passed it a long time back.\n\nShe needs to be able to wash her own hair at 15, or get a haircut. You shouldn't be bathing with your daughter. \n\nYTA", "Lol wtf. I had sx when i was 15 and she could not wash her own hair at the same age?! Its gross in every way.", "Info: how old is your daughter??", "Is your daughter clothed and not in the bathtub when you wash her hair?", "YTA. She\u2019s 15.
