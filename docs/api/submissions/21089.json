They did directly go after OP\u2019s penis size. Not mine. If they did call out mine I could care less. If a man can\u2019t comment on a woman, a woman can\u2019t comment on a man. I have never been embarrassed by my size. I wouldn\u2019t even no if I was small or big nor would I care", "If they wear a swimsuit to game night they are probably trying to be funny. Anyway, the issue was talking to his GF about another woman\u2019s outfit.", "YTA stop looking", "extremely soft YTA but only for mentioning it to your gf. i feel like people are overreacting about the fact you had an opinion about what someone else was wearing, if you noticed that the dress was revealing then there were probably others who noticed it too. your not an AH for bringing it up but just for who you brought it up to", "NTA she and commenters are mad at you for noticing and mentioning it? I (f) saw nothing wrong with making an observation, but perhaps you should have spoken to someone else. Dressing up/down, revealing/modest, loud/muted colors; then go to a public place but not expecting comments? Only a very small percentage doesn't expect attention. There's an old adage \"women dress to be noticed by men, but also dress to be talked about by women.\" These days i supposed 'men' should be replaced by \" potential partner\".", "NTA, despite what people here are saying, if it was obvious, then stating a fact that acknowledges it doesn't make you an AH. It's like if your date asked if a particular girl was pretty, if she's pretty, say so, don't ever say they're not.", "Nah", "NTA", "YTA. You should have just kept your mouth shut.", "YTA. In the future, NEVER do something like this. You shot yourself in the foot. As an example, my wife has a friend that I\u2019ve found so incredibly attractive for over 10 years. Almost wanted to ask her out before I met my wife. I have never once made a comment about her to my wife. There\u2019s no reason to.", "So if you were curious, it would be normal to say \u201cyou look fancy, are you heading out somewhere cool after games?\u201d But no. Instead you remarked at how revealing the dress was. YTA", "YTA\n\nYou should have kept your mouth shut and not been judgmental", "YTA for trying to police what another woman wears & judging her for it. Let her look good and confident! How does it affect you in the least? Especially if it\u2019s a friend. What grown adult needs to put down others? \n\n\nbut Linda sounds cool! Good on her for calling you out. Maybe she could get herself a cooler boyfriend!", "You felt the need to comment on some girl's attire because you went on a date with her once and you think _Linda_ is being sensitive and judgemental? YTA, obviously.", "You may have inadvertently unlocked the secret level of awkwardness. Proceed with caution, my friend. \ud83d\ude05", "YTA - Bringing up a revealing dress? Smooth move, Casanova. Next time, stick to compliments like 'You look nice!' \ud83d\ude02", "YTA. All Linda heard from that statement was: \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about Carole\u2019s body on that dress.\u201d Why would you bad-mouth Carole if she\u2019s your friend? Why would you put Linda in the position to do it as well?", "Carole can wear what she wants, why are you so controlling? It's not a good look. Getting distracted by someone else seems like a good way to mess things up with Linda. Maybe you're not actually over Carole because otherwise why do you care so much?", "YTA let women dress how they want and stop sexualizing them. Girls walk in a bikini in a beach - do you sexualize every single one of them? As someone pan - I don\u2019t care if women or me are half naked around me, doesn\u2019t mean i\u2019m Interested, let people\nbe. I can focus on something else without getting bothered. Learn to Keep it in your pants and stop.", "Dude ya swallowed both feet straight to the hip \nHow's your feet taste", "NTA and everyone saying YTA are virgins", "You made her jealous!  Awareness is soo important particularly if your currently dating someone new (linda) and a previous girl (carol) you dated is there, soo certain behaviours won\u2019t work as trust and other relationship qualities haven\u2019t been formed yet with Linda.  Although you said it in a whim, your dating relationship is still new so you need to watch what you do or say at the moment and until she understands you when you say off the cuff remarks that you, mean nothing.", "Ok so commenting on Carole\u2019s dress and how revealing it was insinuated that you were looking at her body and that it was something that made such a huge impression on you that you just had to talk about it with the girl you\u2019re currently dating after the get together was over. \n\nCan you see how she might think YTA here?", "YTA. Dude it's none of your business what other people wear. And also why in the world would you even think about telling your date that some other girl is being revealing? Especially the girl that you liked before? And then think she's not going to get jealous??", "Yep, if I was Linda I'd probably think OP was still into Carole and would most likely cut my loses there. I wouldn't want to waste anymore time on someone who is still hung up on another person.", "Same. I would definitely comment and expect my hubs to have noticed to discuss it with me if everyone was dressed casual and 1 chick was in a sexy dress.  But I'll admit I'm probably a judgy asshole \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Only sane answer I've seen", "From a woman's perspective - I agree with this. \n\nNot an asshole and I completely see where OP is coming from. But definitely dumb. I personally wouldn't care if my husband noticed a girl was dressed *revealing/a little slutty* during a casual event. I probably would have joined in saying I thought the same thing. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f But all ladies are different.", "Hey bro, that chick I wanted to fuck and still do had some hot sweaty tits tonight, right?", "It's not even about saying it to your girlfriend. \n\nFrom Linda's response it's because he had the thought at all.\n\nShe's calling him a pervert not an asshole, which suggests that she finds it creepy that he's out there eyeing off women and deciding their outfits are revealing.\n\nIt reminds me of my high school. We had white shirts as part of our uniform. We were told we needed to wear singlet tops under these shirts because the male teachers might be able to see our bras and they might be uncomfortable. \n\nMy response was that \"they shouldn't be noticing in the first place. Why would they even think or fixate on that?\"\n\nRegardless of who you say \"did you see her tits\" to, just saying it at all is fucking gross behaviour.", "Yep I heard revealing and fancy and assumed the OP was referring to a summer dress of some kind.", "How do people on this subreddit actually have opinions like this? Just insane", "You\u2019ve been dating her for two months\u2026she\u2019s soon going to be your ex gf. YTA all around", "He\u2019s hoping she dressed up for him. Still had a boner for her apparently.", "I LOVE being catty and judgemental with my BF after we socialize.\nI would have brought up her outfit to him if he didn't.\nAnd maybe later in bed I'd get him going with it again...for fun.", "If we can\u2019t be judgy a-holes with our partners what is the point of even having a partner \ud83d\ude02", "I was shocked at how many people jumped down his throat for commenting on a really out there outfit to his partner. I 100% would have shut the car door & been like \u201cdid you SEE what Carole was wearing?!\u201d", "The difference being?", "She could have came from a different event, or been going to a different event after (a new date). Or she just feels sexy and confident in what she is wearing and she is entitled to that \ud83e\udd37", "Yeah these are the only rational responses in this thread tbh. A lot of people clutching their pearls over just a mindless comment. As if everyone doesn\u2019t do a lil gossip when alone with their partners lol", "Right? My husband and I talk that way. But we\u2019ve been together for 25 years and feel pretty secure.", "Did you also comment on the size of his junk?", "This was exactly what I thought. \u201cOh she dressed sexy\u2026just for me\u201d. Don\u2019t for the life of me understand why he\u2019d bring it up to his almost gf though. Maybe looking to get her to acknowledge that\u2019s the reason to make her jealous or something.", "Commenting in private is NOT policing what anyone is wearing. He didn't tell her to change, or even make a comment to her at all. You literally cannot \"police\" something with silence.", "He's bringing it up in a negative context so it is.\n\nIt's also one of those very subjective terms, which can mean absolutely anything and so is used to put women in their place.\n\nIt's a loaded term and best avoided as a general rule.", "I agree.", "Don't mention it at all!", "He's policing. He's expressing that opinion to someone else, someone who might very well choose to wear something similar in the future. (I'd put money on it that this 'revealing and fancy' dress is just a normal summer dress).\n\nJust because he's not policing the woman directly doesn't mean he isn't policing women's clothes generally and he certainly wasn't being silent about it when he talked about it.\n\nSilent means you don't say anything about it at all.", "That's not how policing works. He's expressing an opinion, and considering the woman he said it to got angry I highly doubt it will influence what she wears. Policing what someone wears is making rules to control it. I don't think you actually understand what policing means"]}
