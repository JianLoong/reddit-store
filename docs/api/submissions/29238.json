I had only met that girl once, briefly at a dinner, but didn't talk much or anything.\n\nFast forward to to last week, i was in town and met this new girl he's been seeing for a month or so. we were having dinner and drinks, and it just slipped out of me \"so are you fully divorced now, its been 6 years?\"\n\nThe table went silent. he started saying he didn't know what i was talking about, that I'm crazy, and stupid, and he got divorced 6 years ago. To shut up and not talk anymore. This was towards the end of the dinner, i paid my share and left quickly after getting the stink eye from both my bro and his new gf.\n\nAs i expected he messaged me a couple of hours later, basically yelling at me and calling me the worst names possible, and then he told my mom and she started berating me as well.\n\nI feel like an ass now, but it was an accident and i had no idea he's been lying to these women he's been dating.\n\nI feel like since we had a few drinks, i may have been tipsy and not thinking before i spoke...but sheesh no reason to call me the worst possible names out there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1697731242, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17bmkgf/aita_for_asking_my_brother_if_he_is_divorced_yet/", "score": 434, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was around your brother's age, and (probably like the women he's dating and most women that age) looking for a serious relationship and the possibility of marriage . . . and that kind of lie wasn't a small one in that context.\n\nYour brother is a massive AH for not being up front with the women he's dating about the legal status of his relationship. You, however, are a hero for not letting him get away with manipulating them.", "Yeah, your brother is TA, not you. You blew his cover, he is angry, understandably so. But he might have mentioned to you that he is acting as if he is free in advance.   \n\n\nAlso, 6 years! Just why...", "NTA. My buddy dated a woman for over 6 months before SURPRISE he found out she has a son. He was miffed that she didn't say anything earlier, but gave her the benefit because it's hard for single parents to date without stigma.    \n\nThen BA-BAM 1 year later finds out that she's still legally married. Her ex is gay so no chance of reconciliation, but her explanation was, \"we were just too lazy to file the paperwork.\"", "NTA. Number one rule of lying is to make sure those that know the truth will also lie for you. He\u2019s an idiot and should just file already ffs. I would suggest never lying for that fool, it\u2019ll make you an even bigger ah that he is.", "NTA. He got what he deserved.  No one should expect others to maintain their lies.", "NTA. \"I had no idea he's been lying to these women he's been dating.\"  It sucks he's been lying to these women and it's stupid for him to think you would somehow magically know he's been lying his ass off for 6 years. You can't help keep up a lie you don't know about.", "NTA. Your brother is, since he should\u2019ve handled the divorce by now, and since he didn\u2019t tell his new girl that he was still married.", "Suuure it \"just slipped\". Regardless, I think NTA. If he's lying to his gf, they have a right to know. If he has a problem with you,  he needs to tell them himself or get divorced.", "NTA. But when you drop a truth bomb, there's bound to be collateral damage.", "He obviously lied to this woman about his situation. Liars don\u2019t get to be all wounded and furious when their lies are exposed. Don\u2019t be a liar. NTA.", "NTA\n\nSo your brother is a liar and can't stand if HE behaves wrong and somebody else brought it to light?", "Not your fault. Bro should have been more honest \ud83d\ude02", "NTA, he\u2019s probably been lying about his previous marriage and is now in the dog house.", "NTA. Your brother shouldn\u2019t be lying to the girls.\n\nMy dad was dating this women and I don\u2019t remember what she said but I said something about my parents not being legally divorced and she was like no, your dad told me he and your mom have been divorced for years. That was not true. My parents didn\u2019t get officially divorced till 4 years ago and that\u2019s only because my dad was getting married. And that\u2019s when the women found out that they weren\u2019t actually divorced", "NTA. Is your brother not signing the divorce papers when he left her? Sounds like a controlling dick.", "He's quite touchy about facts -- NTA.\n\nInstead of berating and calling you names he should take care of his life business. You are not responsible for him getting worked up over a factual question. Yes, if alcohol was not involved it may have not come up but it did. Best to you!", "Gods for you he should not be telling fibs to his girlfriend", "NTA.  He really just needs to get divorced.  Then things like this will never need to happen.", "NTA - your brother is though", "NTA. Your brother is an AH for being verbally abusive, both at the meal and afterwards.", "WTF is up with your mom passionately taking your A-hole bother\u2019s side on this? Was he the golden child? He sounds like he feels entitled to treat others however he wants. Regardless, NTA.", "NTA. He was lying so he got what he deserved.", "NTA. You can't be expected to uphold lies you didn't even know about.", "Nta. The long term gf probably broke up with him because he wouldn't file the papers, and she's tired of waiting around. So he lied to new gf that he's been divorced so its easier to string her along.\n\nBlock your brother until he apologizes and learns how to speak to you with respect. Tell your mom that if she continues to speak to you like that, then she'll get a block as well.", "NTA - Soooooo . .  he's keeping secrets from his new girlfriend and you accidentally let the cat out of the bag . . . not your fault . . . He should have told you he was keeping secrets and lying and what not before the meet up . . .", "NTA;  Your brother can't linger in ambiguous 'separated' land forever and not expect a response.", "NTA.\n\nI'll admit, I can understand procrastinating for 6 years.  I'm terrible at stuff like that- it's \\*always\\* tax day before I file mine, for example.  \n\nBut dumbass got caught in a lie, and now he's got to deal with it.  LOL, I say, and LOL again.", "Nta, what does he think is going to happen when one of them wants to get married at some point?  Is he going to become a bigamist and end up in prison?  Why lie?  Does he want to get back with his wife, even now?  These are all questions I asked my Aunt for decades, she never filed for divorce, for more than thirty years, married legally to a man she was afraid to ever see.  She also had a son, with a different man, who wanted to marry her, but couldn't, which was actually a good thing.  She had truly terrible taste in men, always picking some dude that abused her in some way.", "NTA\n\nYour mother should know better.  If she wants him to be in a happy relationship, she should ENCOURAGE him to file.    \n\nHe's lying and pissed that he got caught in a lie.     \n\nBack when I was single, I can't tell you how many men tried this.  Before we ever got intimate or serious, I would ask to see a copy of the divorce decree.     More than one would pull the 'we're divorced in my mind' BS.         Nope.    Not gonna happen.", "WHAT!? NO YOU'RE STUPID SHUT UP! yeah that doesn't sound like somebody hiding something", "OP is the bringer of his \"just deserts\"! NTA- and keep fighting the good fight, whether intentional or not.", "This prove your never too old to tattle tale to mom", "NTA, your brother got caught in a lie and tried to cover it by attacking you. mine does the same thing.", "ESH.\n\nWas it tactful? Absolutely not. And it's an odd thing to bring up (at least with that phrasing) at dinner when meeting with a new person they're dating, makes me think you knew damn well what you were doing.\n\nBut, if he *has* been lying to people and *is* still legally married, then yeah, I'd call it karma.\n\nBut, I don't think we know the whole story. It's all pretty sus. Safest bet is you're both asses.", "NTA because it's a legal definition that he can choose, and he hasn't done anything to progress it. He isn't divorced so if he says he is he's been lying to them.", "ESH\n\nIt\u2019s just common sense to not talk about someone\u2019s ex in front of their current partner. So YTA for talking about his ex at all. \n\nHe\u2019s also TA for lying to his current gf about his relationship status. He should have been honest with her.", "NTA. I rarely side with people who expect you to lie for them without ever even giving a heads up about what is sensitive information. In this situation, it feels like you unintentionally did brother's gf a big favor.", "ESH, obviously he sucks for lying to them, but why would bring up his ex during dinner? Idk how that would've been a good topic to discuss with his new lady friend \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "ESH. It was an inappropriate question but how were you supposed to know he was lying to his new GF?", "ESH. \n\n\u201cIt just slipped,\u201d gtfo no way you just let that one slip. You\u2019re an adult you know what happens when people say stuff like that, especially in front of the gf. If you had a concern about him lying to his gf you should\u2019ve just addressed it with him privately. If he wants to be an AH let him, in the end it\u2019s his life and karma always comes around. \n\nYou\u2019re brother here is the even bigger AH here though. He\u2019s blatantly lying to this poor woman. I say he deserved it, it would\u2019ve been different if he just hadn\u2019t told her yet (then you absolutely would be the AH) but he flat out just lied and then tried to cover it up. I hope his gf ran out so fast. I guess I support what you did for the woman exposing him before things got serious between them, but it could\u2019ve been handled in a more mature way.", "ESH.  You could have handled it more discreetly, but brother sucks since he's about 5 1/2 years late on getting divorced.  He needs to close that chapter and move on.", "YTA - You don't ask personal questions or discuss personal things like that in front of anyone outside of family. \n\nHe is wrong for lying, but it's not your place to out him or involve yourself, even indirectly. He's your brother, and that relationship is more important to maintain than the one you have with anyone he's sleeping with. Being tipsy is not an excuse.", "AITA, none of your business for one but if it really bothers you, you could have asked him privately.", "NTA if the truth hurts take an aspirin. \nWhy would you support a man (any man) lying to a woman he is dating. Why hadn\u2019t he gotten divorced? 6 years is a very long time to wait and for what? \nTell your brother he is an extreme asshole for lying and to get upset with you GROW UP handle your life like everyone else does. Tell him emphatically that you will not now or ever lie for him!!!  Tell the people blowing up your phone the same thing. Not lying for anyone. If they persist block them!", "YTA for \"we were having dinner and drinks, and it just slipped out of me \"so are you fully divorced now, it's been 6 years?\" How does that slip out when you're meeting someone's new gf? You have no idea what in his past he's revealed to someone in a month. You don't like your brother for what he's done, which is your choice, but getting back at him in front of someone else in a public place is childish.", "ESH\n\nYou absolutely didn\u2019t accidentally let it slip out. Don\u2019t lie. You were being passive aggressive for fun.\n\nHe\u2019s a dick too for not dealing with his divorce and lying about his marital status.", "ESH - Was it your place to let the woman he was dating know that he was lying?  Probably not.  And being tipsy isn't an excuse for poor behavior.  However, he's also TA for lying to them in the first place.", "ESH\n\nI think your brother is a wayyyyy bigger AH because that's a wild thing to keep from a partner and at this point it seems like something else has to be going on for him to not be divorced. You're also a small AH because even if he had finished the paperwork, a pretty rude question to ask in front of a new partner.", "NTA but maybe MYOB", "ESH", "[deleted]", "YTA- Use some common sense OP. I know it just slipped but REALLY?", "I won\u2019t say your the Ahole but that\u2019s not a question for the dinner table.  As for the question itself it was a legitimate question to ask since you hadn\u2019t seen your brother for a while.  What he\u2019s been telling these women is on him not on you, if he\u2019s dragging his feet on the divorce he\u2019s bringing this stuff on himself.", "Strong YTA vibes here. Seems OP likes to put his nose in other people's business.", "They\u2019re all fucking idiots.", "YTA... but really for not having a filter or self-awareness at the time. That kind of question concerning the status of a past major relationship is best left for when it's just the two of you.\n\nHe proved his AH Bonafides by tearing you apart on the phone.", "ESH - He has no reason to not have taken care of his divorce years ago but it\u2019s also incredibly difficult to believe that this just slipped out of your mouth after 6 years of knowing about it as well.", "UMMMM YTA because your intentions weren\u2019t pure. Idk why but reddit seems to have no loyalty to family and people are always \u201cwell do the right thing\u201d yes and no. You could have privately discussed that with your brother but not only did you ask but you brought up the fact of time since he left the wife. YTA and seems like you are jealous tbh. I wouldn\u2019t talk to you anymore and I see why he didn\u2019t bring the last woman around you", "Talking about someone elses divorce in general is kind of rude let alone publicly.

Is OP is not lying about anything what ammo does he have.", "Nice reading, OP is female.", "Filing fees, court fees, lawyers fees to split assets/custody, and that's just if you can get a no-fault divorce.", "Court and lawyer fees and some people get things like insurance or benefits from marriage. Plus depending on age or how it\u2019s written, you might have to split things like retirement accounts which can screw you over if you\u2019re close to retirement. When most people are divorcing, they aren\u2019t thinking what\u2019s best for everyone, just for themselves and when half of someone\u2019s 401k account can determine if you can retire or have to work, you get mean.", "To my understanding, this is not the case in all US States, let alone other parts of the world.  Source: Married an attorney, that loves doing no-contest divorces. IANAL.", "> If both parties agree to the divorce\n\nThat's a pretty big \"if.\" So many people think they are going to have an amicable divorce and then find out that their soon to be ex has other ideas.", "Yeah, my Aunt had a son later in life, long after her and her husband parted ways.  When she died, he sued her son for half of the home she owned.  He almost won too.  She was at least smart enough to have actually set up a will beforehand and Power of Attorney.", "I was at the hospital the day both her kids were born to sign paperwork stating they weren't mine and the actual father's signed claiming paternity. Sweet kids, they've been to a couple of my sons bdays and vise versa.", ">In many countries, the legal husband becomes the legal father of any children the wife has, whether he\u2019s seen her in 10 years or not.\n\nAnd it can be a surprising how many countries that is and which ones. The UK the biological father can't pass down his citizenship if the mother is married to someone else because the husband is legally the father. Length of separation or the fact he couldn't actually be the father is irrelevant.\n\n(Not usually relevant to citizenship since it can just go through the mother. But I've seen it more times that you would think when it couldnt for whatever reason.", "She didn't know any of that. As far as she knew she was meeting a new GF, she had no idea what he had told the GF. She meets new GF and immediately brings up his ex and divorce? That's weird. Do you bring up your friends EX's when you meet their new partners?", "Yes and you would be extremely rude to ask about a previous relationship in front of the person's partner when first meeting her.\n\nAsking 'at some point' could have been in private.\n\nI would also find it rude to ask about his money situation after you refused to help. If she had given him some money to help it would be a different matter.", "I never said any of that. Congratulations on winning an argument with yourself.", "No, it's rude as fuck to bring up a previous relationship when meeting a new partner for the first time.", "That's why that voted ESH", "Huge life events? They split 6 years ago, that\u2019s all the bearing it had on her. She mentioned it to shame the brother, she\u2019s garbage could of just kept her mouth shut.", "Because a normal person knows what is and isn\u2019t appropriate to say in while meeting someone for the first time?\n\nIf a woman finds out she\u2019s infertile that\u2019s a major life event but probably not something you should casually ask about when meeting her new boyfriend for the first time right?", "We have no proof his brother was lying to his new girl at all and was probably just trying to shrug it off because he didn't feel like having this discussion at freaking dinner in front of his arsehole brother", "Females can get gonorrhoea too \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nThough this does explain why everyone is being so defensive of op", "Considering he never divorced her, his wife isn't an Ex.

OP is not obligated to participate in their bother's dishonesty.", "Marital status is not something I keep private. It's public information and should be disclosed very early in a relationship (probably before the first date). \n\nIt's not something to be ashamed of, and the fact you think it is something that must be kept private says more about *you* than it does about OP.", "Not any more rude than lying to your current SO about your marital status!", "Private medical information is the same thing as mentioning an ex wife? LOL mmmk", "Sure we do. Nobody acts like he did if she already knew. She was also visibly upset. Why are you siding so hard with a liar.", "Semantics, they have been separated for 6 yrs. They are no longer in a romantic relationship or acting as partners.", "Asking about someone's previous marriage when first meeting a new partner is rude no matter how you word it.", "Yes they are both assholes.", "In this context yeah they\u2019re both things that are inappropriate to bring up when meetings someone\u2019s spouse for the first time\n\nAlso why are you acting like that isn\u2019t just as important to know in a relationship? If you want another example, how about bringing up an \nabusive ex? That\u2019s another major life event right?", "Where does it say she was visibly upset?? You're just creating your own head canon now.\n\nI didn't say she knew, I just said we have no proof of him lying to her about this subject previously. There's a fair chance that he hadn't broached the subject with her since they'd only been dating for a \"month or so\".\n\nI could definitely understand your point of view if this was the lady he'd been dating for 5 years at the dinner table and he got defensive when op brought up his lack of divorce finalisation, then he'd have some serious explaining to do and op might even be justified in his actions for bringing it to light.\n\nHowever that's not what happened.", "You're engaging in sophistry. OP wasn't asking about the marriage. She was asking about the divorce (or lack thereof).", "Ah yes, you'd much rather this woman be tricked peacefully and easily. We get it. There's nothing wrong with using a woman, sleeping with her, tricking her into a relationship with you under false pretenses. \n\nYou want to be able to trick your partners without worrying about it being socially acceptable for your family to tell her.", "They're still married.  It's not a previous marriage.", "You know what is even more important in a relationship other than expecting family members to never bring up their former inlaws (which is an absurd expectation)?
