Honestly, you should have done it sooner, and I don't see why you think he's an alright guy when he is clearly just homophobic and invasive. Why does he need to make \"jokes\" about your sexuality? It's not funny and never has been, and we are way past that point in society where anyone should be deciding who the 'man' is in a relationship between two women. \n\nNext time double down and ask him why he is obsessed with your relationship. Put him on the spot. He upsets your girlfriend and shouldn't be allowed to continue. If I were you I wouldn't want to hang out anywhere that he is again, or with anyone who thinks his behaviour is okay.\n\nEdit: I just came back to this comment and just want to clarify that there was never a point in society where anyone should have been deciding who the 'man' is in a relationship between two women, but unfortunately there was a time where it was definitely normalised to do this. However, I would like to think that we have progressed enough to call people out for this outdated view of gender and relationship norms", "NTA - I don't get why he is upset... He's allowed to make personal crude remarks about your relationship, but you make a crude remark that isn't even directed at him and he gets butthurt? I know I know this is an obvious dig, but feels a teensy bit like he just doesn't like people talking about big penises... for some reason...", "NTA \n\nAlan sounds like a dick who is constantly trying to belittle you and upsetting your girlfriend by implying she\u2019s unfeminine. What you said wasn\u2019t Oscar Wilde but you were defending yourself and your girlfriend and frankly someone should have shut that arse up long before this point. You didn\u2019t even insult him or anyone else at the table (which he had been doing repeatedly). \n\nHe\u2019s an insecure prick who seems so scared by the very idea of a happy couple who are comfortable in their own skin that he has to resort to the type of name calling even a 12 year old would find juvenile. Why doesn\u2019t he go back to the play ground and leave the adults in peace.", "NTA, Alan has a complex. Alan got shut down. That's Alan's problem. His girlfriend is an enabler, she should ask him why he's so obsessed. Don't you dare  apologise.", "NTA  \nso Alan is allowed to make rude and uncomfortable remarks to you, but when you defend yourself suddenly, you're the bad guy? No way. Alan doesn't seem like the best friend to have if he is willing to treat you this way...", "NTA, honestly you should probably ask your friend to not bring him over again and question why they are even dating them.", "NTA - sure it was crude but Alan is an AH, so what if you had to put him in his place a little.", "NTA, yes the joke was crude and in poor taste but Allan had gone way too far past not okay. You should have shut him down in a more mature way, but then you are pretty young so maybe not unexpected. I would have called him out for being inappropriate and told him to keep his thoughts to himself.", "NTA. People like Alan don't like it when the \"joke\" is turned back on them. They have the thinnest skin of all.", "I probably would have said \"bigger than yours\" but dealer's choice. NTA", "NTA, your friend got what he deserved. I'm a bit concerned about your gf wanting you to roll over. Aren't you a team? Doesn't she feel offended on your behalf and protective of you? Or is the most important thing for her to avoid any conflicts? That's now how life works and that's not how you silence bullies, which Alan is. \n\nIf you apologise, you'll get more of the same.", "I think your friends should be more concerned about the massive c-ck known as Alan.

Could have been worded better / differently but in my opinion you can't keep making mean comments about people and expect they never reply. Alan is just angry he got called out on his bullshit and is now hiding behind the \"crudeness\". Meanwhile what he said was very rude. I would make this my hill to die on. He thinks just because you are younger and a woman he can make fun of you and you shouldn't respond. Well he is wrong. Being a (maybe tiny) dick has consequences.
