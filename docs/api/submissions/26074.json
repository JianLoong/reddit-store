He has cooked for the family before. He has leftovers, and they\u2019re his unless he says otherwise.\n\nMy daughter is the opposite, she buys a lot of stuff with her money. She still leaves enough saved over in case she needs to buy food or toiletries.

She goes into his room and wears his clothes or accessories to school. Her brother is of course upset by this. If she asked he might have said yes, but she doesn\u2019t. \nHer defense for the food is that its in the fridge, anyone can take from it. \n\nHer defense for the clothes is that it fits her style better, and she can\u2019t find clothes like her brother wears.

He has two keys for his room now.\n\nMy daughter is very clearly upset, but hasn\u2019t said anything. My wife understands the mini fridge, but thinks the two locks is too much.

This is not okay and you are enabling it by going along with your wife. Be the grownup in the family and do something.", "Then your son definitely.needs therapy too and you shouldn't consult your wife about it. Not to be vindictive, but because she has made it clear she is incapable of empathising with your son, whose privacy is being invaded and whose food he spent time cooking is being stolen from him. He has a right to feel safe and protected in his own home. His mother is inexplicably failing to even consider how he feels in all this. \n\nAnd yes, daughter needs consequences. Even if your wife undermines them (although I bet there's something you can think of that she can't undo). Your son *needs to see you sticking up for him*. You did a great job getting him the fridge and locks, but if you leave it at that, you're teaching him that he must just accept being treated  like shit and hope that someone comes along to mitigate  the effects.", "Your daughter is stealing.  Doesn\u2019t matter who she is stealing from.  The items are not hers.  She should not steal them.", "Info: Does she always devalue her son in favor of her daughter? How many other ways does she show obvious favoritism? \n\nIf you figured that out you\u2019ll know whether or not therapy is on the table. Your son however could use some support so I\u2019d hold my ground on those locks", "Your wife is 100% wrong. I would go ballistic if that kept happening. We had one \" Don't eat your sister's leftovers because you didn't pay for them\" conversation and they got it", "If your daughter stole from anyone or anything else she\u2019d get a fine/police called. I think you\u2019re better off nipping this one in the butt at home before she\u2019s getting crap on her record."]}
