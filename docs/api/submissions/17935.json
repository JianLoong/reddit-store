{"id": 17935, "submission_id": "13p5l5y", "title": "AITA for the way I answered my friend's questions about my abortion?", "selftext": "To get right into it, I had an abortion a few years ago. I'm not ashamed of it and I don't regret it, and I'm very lucky to have been living somewhere where it was legal. I know there's going to be people hating on me for that alone and you're allowed your opinion. But that's not what I'm asking for judgment on.\r  \n\r  \nOne of my friends \"Abby\" told me recently that her friend \"Beth\" was about to have an abortion. Abby knows that I've gone through it, so she asked if I'd be willing to come over and hang out with them to help support her. I've met Beth a few times at parties and whatnot and she and her husband seemed really nice. I can't say we had much in common, but I liked talking to her! So we've been hanging out a bit more here and there.\r  \n\r  \nI don't want to write about someone's personal feelings, so I'll just say she hasn't been handling it well and I feel terrible for her. She and her husband have three kids already and only recently moved back out of his parents' house, so to be blunt this was an issue of resources more than lack of wanting. A lot of her questions have now started veering off into \"how do you go on after this\" territory. I've told her everything I can think of - one day at a time, getting back into routines, self care when you're able to, etc.\r  \n\r  \nWell yesterday I was over and she kept asking those same kinds of questions, like \"how did you deal with the guilt?\" and \"when does this grief end?\" I did my best to comfort her- she's in a lot of pain, I really sincerely want to help. She wound up snapping at me and basically said I was feeding her crap answers. She called them \"Disney lines\", and asked me outright how I personally dealt with the mourning period.\r  \n\r  \nAnd so, I told her I didn't have one. I don't like to admit it because I've seen people get really upset over it, but truthfully I didn't feel anything like that about my abortion. I don't want children ever, and my dad has always been really progressive growing up. Beth was going through something much harder, and I guess it just didn't phase me in that manner- it was simply a minor surgery for me. The money spent and work missed were the things I was most upset about. I tried to also add that I know a few women myself who have gone through this too and can probably relate to her more. I started to tell her I really just wanted to help and that I could see if any of them maybe wanted to meet up or maybe just weigh in on what they did, but she got very quiet and asked me to leave.\r  \n\r  \nNext thing I know, Abby is calling me to let me know that Beth has posted something on facebook about me and how I'm a heartless murdering monster. I don't even know what to think. I'm sorry this is so rushed, I'm just in shock. I've already been unfriended by a few of my other parent friends, and I'm thinking it's related. I'm not on facebook but Abby sent me screenshots, and they're...harsh. I guess I just want to know if I deserve it. So, was ITA? Should I have said something else?", "created_utc": 1684794501, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13p5l5y/aita_for_the_way_i_answered_my_friends_questions/", "score": 156, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ridiculous.\n\nYou were so kind and you tried to help. It sounds like she was grieving really hard and just decided to take it out on you. The Facebook defamation of you is just wrong and terrible, insulting and how dare she share your personal information on social media. \n\nYou should be able to contact Facebook and have her post removed if you're so inclined. If she does it again you can report her for harassment (or hell you could do it now). Depends on what is best for you.\n\nYou did NOTHING wrong. Not the abortion, not how you felt about it, and you were so kind to try and help this person. You are not a heartless baby murderer ffs. Honestly if that's how Beth really feels, she's a hypocrite. She's choosing money over a baby. IMO sometimes thats the choice you have to make, but she has absolutely no right to rake you over coals over her self righteousness.\n\nSorry OP. You deserve better friends.", "NTA. Her guilt is overflowing to you, so stay safe. You have your peace, and she is just lashing out because she needs to push the guilt away", "NTA. Having kids, choosing not to have kids, having an abortion - these are all deeply personal things. It was very kind of you to agree to support her in the beginning but as you note you clearly are not the best person to support her now. This isn't your fault - the two of you obviously inherently have had very different experiences.\n\nShe is lashing out at you because in this moment she regrets the decision she made. \n\nEnlist the help of your friend who initially connected the two of you. It's absolutely reasonable for the two of you to approach her to insist she remove the Facebook post immediately. I'm assuming it alludes to the fact that you also had an abortion. You absolutely shouldn't be ashamed of that, but the general FB community has zero right to your medical history. \n\nAfter that discussion, definitely cut off contact with this person. You have a right to protect yourself from *her* heartless remarks about you.", "NTA\n\nHoly shit. I'm so sorry she's lashing out like that.\n\nYour feelings aren't wrong. They're just not her feelings. For her to do this because you're not the perfect mirror for her own feelings is really inappropriate. Hope you're doing okay.", "NTA. She asked about your personal experience; it sounds like the only way she wouldn't have been upset would have involved you literally lying.  \n\nI suspect she's hurting -- abortion of a wanted baby has a different feel to an unwanted baby -- but that doesn't excuse shitting on you.  You didn't deserve vitriol.", "NTA, Beth needs to back off. She didn't like answers you gave her and she went and publicly shamed you, She is the AH.", "NTA. \n\nShe asked for your truth and you gave that to her. It just wasn't what she wanted to hear.", "NTA. You knew what you wanted and you did it. No trauma because you thought it through.\r  \n\r  \nShe's angry because she wanted you to convince her not to have an abortion. You were supposed to be so traumatized that you bitterly regret it every day. She could have gone back to her husband with her tale of woe from somebody who had been through the procedure and the aftermath. She could explain how, even if they couldn't afford another child, the trauma of terminating would be overwhelming.\r  \n\r  \nIn short, she's angry because you didn't have the trauma that she needed you to have.", "NTA \n\nA lot of us think that abortion is not that big of a deal. You tried to help her and she stab you in the back, she asked you to be real about what you felt and she couldn't handle it.", "Wow.... it is absolutely horrible how we women treat each other sometimes and I am sorry this is happening to you. \n\nNTA  I am absolutely appalled at how this woman is treating you but it is a reflection of her own guilt and no reflection on you at all.  What a....", "Oh gosh NTA.  You tried to help support someone, but your experience was not the same.  You didn't do anything wrong and her reaction is unhinged since she is feeling guilt and shame over her choice.  I have known women who went through abortions and had vastly different feelings and reactions to it.  I would definitely block her and move on and ask that your friend never talk to you or relay your information to her friend again.", "NTA\n\n\u201cThe only moral abortion, is my abortion,\u201d\n\nYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Do not feel guilty about not bringing an unwanted child into the world.", "NTA Im also someone who also doesn\u2019t want children and had an abortion. I feel no guilt and was relieved when it was over. You can only speak from your own experience, which you did.", "Wow. I have a few horrible words for Beth. She\u2019s disgusting for making a post wtf. \n\nYou told her exactly what she was asking and you are def NTA for them. Wow. You don\u2019t deserve that at all.", "NTA you told the truth and you don\u2019t have to feel the same way she does. Nothing in this post suggests that you were trying to force your views on her, it seems you were genuinely trying to help and I\u2019d go NAH because I understand her reaction in feeling upset that she thought you\u2019d had the same experience only to find out you didn\u2019t but posting and publicly shaming you is an AH move especially since she\u2019s about to have the same procedure", "NTA and you need to cut Beth off. Her grief will never be an excuse to publicly trash you, or even privately judge you. Any sympathy for her would have evaporated with her commentary on you.", "NTA, she is lashing out at you.", "NTA - You were asked to share your honest experience.  Which you did.  I'm sure she's responding out of hurt for her own situation and not out of your comment.  I'm also sure it doesn't hurt you any less.  I'm sorry you're going through this when you were simply trying to be supportive.", "NTA. And you\u2019re not terrible. \n\nIm in the same situation as Beth. I have 3 and am expecting my 4th and we don\u2019t really have the space (looking for a new house but nothing suitable has popped up yet). \n\nUltimately, I decided to keep it because I know I can\u2019t live with the guilt and if Beth can\u2019t either, she\u2019s gonna have to figure something out - a way to provide for and keep it. She can\u2019t go around blaming other people for not telling her whatever it is she wants/expects to hear.", "100% NTA. you are entitled to your feelings about your abortion as is Beth is entitled to her feelings about hers. but she is not entitled to push her feelings & views onto you, & especially not entitled to share an intimate detail about your life on social media. i think that what you did was very kind, & you were attempting to steer her in the right direction by answering her question truthfully (after she pressed you) & suggesting talking to others may be more helpful. if Beth is struggling this much she should see a therapist or someone else who can help her sort out her emotions & get through the mourning period. you are not a monster bc you didn\u2019t mourn after your abortion.", "NTA- Beth is though. Her expecting you to have the magic answer to absolve her of her guilt is ridiculous. And for her  to blast you on FB after you offered her so much time and attention must be infuriating.", "NTA - I would make an account and comment \n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m a heartless monster what does that make you? A monster with a heart? Stop projecting. Cause baby we in this together now, see you at the next roe v wade protest.\u201d", "Definitely NTA! I also had an abortion that was not emotionally painful or shameful. I had a minor surgical procedure because of an unintended and unwanted pregnancy. You shared your experience, as you were asked to.", "NTA, you can only speak from your own experience and that's what you did. Simple. Unfortunately it's a very contentious subject for which some people have strong opinions, but it doesn't sound to me like you did anything wrong.", "NTA \n\nShe should have never asked the question if she wasn\u2019t prepared for the potential answer. Some people really struggle with the concept of abortion and the emotions with it others don\u2019t. Their are some people in this world who should never have children", "NTA. Each woman's abortion experience will be different. Your path is just as valid as anyone's (and, in fact, if I ever had to have had an abortion, that's how I would handle it, to be honest). Beth has one script for the abortion; she needs a new screenwriter, because she clearly does not want to get rid of the fetus.", "NTA - The only answer she wanted was a magical one to solve or wipe away her feelings about her experience. You do not deserve her vile post. You and your friend had good intentions to support Beth but in her current state she is unable to be kind.\n\nThe 'Disney Lines' was time to retreat. She is suffering and spewing anger at you is not justified, only hurtful. Anyone who would unfriend you due to her her post lacks the understanding that what one person's claims do not make it true. Best to you.", "NTA - you have a right to your own experience and feelings on the matter, and she has the right to hers.. what she doesn\u2019t have the right to is attack your character because she doesn\u2019t agree.", "NTA. Clearly she has a lot of complicated feelings about having an abortion. That's very valid and sad for her. But the way for her to get past that is not by making her grief into everybody's problem. There are counselors for this. There are honest to God *faith retreats* for this. She obviously has a lot of shame about abortion but that's her problem! Her problem! Not yours. She is devastated and thinks hurting other people is going to make her pain less or more worthy or something. I'm so sorry that you're getting crap over this because you don't deserve it. Lying to her about a fake mourning period might have felt nicer in the moment to her, but it certainly wouldn't have been kind and indeed, it would have been downright disastrous once you had been found out. You did the right thing. She did not.", "NTA. You were asked to help and you did to the best of your ability. She shouldn\u2019t be so judgmental. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. She asked you a direct question and you gave her an honest answer. It sucks that she\u2019s having a hard time, but she\u2019s the asshole here 100%. You were trying to help. \n\nIn retrospect it\u2019s obvious you really haven\u2019t gone through the same thing and thus it was inadvertently misguided for Abby to pull you in for support. I\u2019m like you - I don\u2019t regret my abortion at all, and I never had any feelings to work through. I wouldn\u2019t identify with someone who was attached to their pregnancy getting an abortion.", "NTA. She is feeling shame  and guilt and is trying to push it off on you. She also appears to be one of those people who think that everyone who does not agree with her views and opinions are morally bankrupt sinners. The worst kind.", "NTA, you can't be blamed for not having the feelings she wants you to have.", "NTA at all. I've had an abortion too and besides some really weird hormonal cries the first 2-3 days where I was mainly annoyed by myself for crying without feeling like crying, I never regretted it either. It was the right decision. It's not even weird to not being sad. How could you be sad about something lost that was never desired nor enjoyed but caused a lot of mental and physical issues? \nSame time it's normal to be sad if you actually enjoyed and/or wanted it. Be it stemming from a conscious decision or a hormonal one. People just aren't the same and it's just fair for you to be honest after being asked about your personal experience. \n\nStill, Beth will have a hard, hard time ahead of her. I'm very sorry for her loss.", "NTA. No way this is on you. If Beth and her husband had been clear with each other on knowing that they couldn't handle an abortion, then they should have taken responsibility and figured out how to not get pregnant. They should have doubled up birth control. Condoms for him and the pill or an IUD or something similar for her. They know how to get pregnant (obviously), they need to start taking responsibility for not getting there. Or deal with an abortion. But none of this is your fault.", "So, by her own admission, if she had an abortion also then she is a heart-felt murdering monster?  How dare her post those things about you. You didn't even get too personal about her in your  anonymous post. I wish you all the best.", "NTA. Of course you don't deserve it! How awful of Beth to treat you like that. She's the one that's heartless. \n\nPeople experience grief differently, and some don't have it all in some circumstances. And that's okay!\n\nSave those screenshots. Beth's comments could be considered libelous. People have successfully sued over comments people have posted on facebook. You could meet w/a lawyer about it (most will give a free consultation). A stern letter from a lawyer could also get Abby to take the comments down.", "NTA. It sounds like Beth would end up really regretting an abortion. You were frank and honest. You did nothing wrong by answering her questions.", "NTA but Beth is a huge one. Not everyone has an abortion for the same reasons and not everyone has the same reaction to it. My friend didn\u2019t want kids ever but afterwards she still felt devastated and it wreaked her. My cousin who did want kids had one after she left her ex and she didn\u2019t feel anything either. She has no right to judge you and she\u2019s a hypocrite for calling you any names when she\u2019s going through the same procedure. I\u2019d cut her off for good", "i\u2019m sorry OP you went out of your way to help someone only to have them turn on you. i can assure you that you don\u2019t deserve any of what\u2019s happening right now \ud83d\udc9b \n\nNTA", "NTA, no you don't deserve this.\n\nI feel like most people would like abortion to be something traumatic and depressing when for a lot of people it's just a relief because the pregnancy or the child would be more traumatic and depressing whether the reason is medical, financial, personal, or really anything else.", "NTA\nThey asked,  you answered. \n\nSeems to me that Beth should not get an abortion. She can't handle the 'guilt' and she's already dreading the 'mourning'. This does not sound like someone who is ready to part with pregnancy to me. \n\nI think you should talk very sternly with your 'friends ' about how they asked you to share details of a personal experience, to then have it smeared out over social media.", "Absolutely, 100% NTA. You were supportive of her and tried to be there for her in a dark time, but the reality is that your situation and hers weren\u2019t really that similar. Despite that, you continued being supportive as best as you were able. When asked a direct question about your grieving process, you responded honestly. You didn\u2019t volunteer that you had an easier time than she did; you simply told her the truth when asked a direct question.\n\nI\u2019m really sorry this is happening to you. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong, here, and you certainly don\u2019t deserve to be called out as a heartless murderer on social media.", "NTA.\n\nI was the same with my abortion as you and it is, as you know, a perfectly valid reaction. Your experience was different to Beth\u2019s and you tried to help her nonetheless and answered her question honestly when she asked. \n\nIn the same way as you didn\u2019t judge her for her reaction, she should not have judged you for yours. Beth also needs to understand that discussing this in a personal sense and having differing views is completely different to imposing morality on the situation, and especially on anyone\u2019s reaction. \n\nYou do not deserve this whatsoever and, despite the fact that Beth is going through a rough time, I would be first requesting she take the posts down and second engaging legal help if she didn\u2019t. This may sound harsh, but I\u2019ll tell you why. First, she is posting your private medical information on social media and second she is posting it about an extremely contentious topic (even though it shouldn\u2019t be, it is). \n\nAs someone who has worked on the legal and activism side of women\u2019s reproductive rights, this can have serious ramifications. I have seen people denied visas to countries for having had an abortion. I have seen people targeted by lunatics for having had an abortion. I have seen people denied jobs for having had an abortion. \n\nIf you choose to go public about having had an abortion, that is up to you. Many of us do, but there can be consequences to that due to the attitude around the world, which differs from the jurisdictions in which it is legal. And because there are consequences, it is entirely up to the person who has had the abortion whether they choose to go public. These consequences should not exist, but unfortunately they do. \n\nBeth is an awful person. It doesn\u2019t matter that she\u2019s grieving. Calling a person who accessed healthcare a heartless murderer is crossing a line no matter what the circumstances.", "I'm going with NTA.\n\nBeth is feeling incredibly guilty about, basically, killing her unborn child because they can't afford to raise another kid. That's a completely fair and valid position.\n\nYou don't feel guilt about your abortion. That's fair, too. That's how you felt about your abortion, but it means that you can't really be much help to Beth.", "NTA she wanted the truth but she couldn\u2019t handle the truth.", "NTA. I don\u2019t want kids and would probably do the same if I was ever to find myself in that situation. It\u2019s not your fault that you didn\u2019t feel guilty, I don\u2019t think I would either. There is nothing else you could have said. Except maybe refer her to someone who HAD to abort their child. She needs to learn about contraception.", "NTA. Different experiences, you didn\u2019t deserved that hate. I get it that she\u2019s venting but going so far as to call you a monster? Nah, might be better to distance yourself for a bit.", "Wow. What a slap in the face for you. I\u2019m so sorry- because this is the epitome of CHOICE. You shared your honest story, you were vulnerable in your own right and having that weaponized against you is just super icky. \nI\u2019m so sorry. Thank you for being honest- please keep being honest and brave!", "NTA.  You did absolutely nothing wrong.  What Beth did is the reason why so many other women are uncomfortable discussing their own experiences.  So much for women supporting women.", "OP, NTA! \n\nShe asked you questions, you gave her clear answers based on YOUR experience. But it's clear that she didn't like the answers. Not all woman feel guilty having an abortion, and it's not ANYONE'S place to judge!\n\nAs other posters have suggested, contact Facebook to have the post removed! She seriously overstepped by posting in the first place.", "NTA.\n\nBeth pushed you and so you gave the truthful answer, it didn't conform to her own views and now she's being destructive. She's TA for pushing it and for the follow up posts", "NTA. You *tried* saying other things, but she wasn\u2019t having it, so you were honest. I get that she\u2019s having a very hard time right now, but it\u2019s also not your fault that you two happen to be wired differently regarding abortions. (Honestly, reading the entire post gives me the feeling that maybe Beth is just be straight-up anti-choice, and if so, her shitty response doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with what OP said or how she said it, she\u2019s just lashing out at the idea that someone else is \u201cfine\u201d with having an abortion, period. But maybe I\u2019m reading too much into that aspect. Either way, Beth is the asshole here. I have empathy for her own pain that she\u2019s struggling with, but that\u2019s no excuse to talk shit about someone else who was simply lucky enough to have an easier time of it.)", "Reply on socials: \u201cTakes one to know one?\u201d", "She sounds like the person who\u2019d be calling abortion murder if she was richer", "NTA. I am so sorry you have to deal with this. It is real bs. You absolutely respected her in her time of need and for her to just throw this at you is absolutely awful.", "NTA\n\nPersonalities aside - You and Beth came from fundamentally different places to this decision, and are going to have fundamentally different reactions afterwards. Making this decision can be straightforward or wrenching, and a mix of everything from a sense of relief to a heartbreak and everything in between. She\u2019s obviously one one end of that spectrum, and you were towards the other. No judgements or anything of the sort there. Just truth.\n\nYou sadly got put in a situation where because you both had an abortion, there was a thought you\u2019d share a lot in common about how to deal with it. But it\u2019s unique and different for anyone, and this was a little bit of a bad, but surely unintentional, setup for you.", "NTA what she needs is a therapist, and you are not one.", "NTA no matter the feelings towards it the action is the same either way. She pushed a sensitive matter that she shudnt have and got upset at the answer.", "NTA at all\u2026 what the hell would make her think it\u2019s even remotely ok to blast your personal business online simply because you were honest with her? I\u2019m really sorry she repaid your kindness and honesty this way. What she\u2019s going through is no excuse to act that way.", "NTA. I've never had an abortion, but it's a personal decision. Your experience is different from hers, you can't help that. I hope she deletes the post and gets some help. She sounds like she needs therapy.", "NTA. The comments that Beth is making about you are blatantly hypocritical, considering she is about to have the same procedure done. Everyone handles things differently. Sometimes, what's easy for one person is extremely difficult for another. I've also had an abortion and didn't feel a tinge of guilt, I felt relief. Doesn't mean it was easy for me, though. It's a difficult thing to go through regardless of the reasoning. What were you supposed to do? Lie? Fein guilt and shame? Your honesty about something so sensitive is, frankly, quite admirable.", "You absolutely do NOT deserve it. You tried to be gentle. She pushed you. And then she didn\u2019t like the answer. Too fucking bad. NTA", "You 100% didn't deserve that and it sounds like Beth probably shouldn't have had that abortion. She asked a question, after YOU COMFORTED HER, didn't like the answer and lashed out in a totally inappropriate and unacceptable manor. Did she happen to mention in that post that she's also a \"murdering monster\"? Highly doubt it. A thousand times over NTA.", "NTA cut that friend off, she clearly is projecting but you don\u2019t need to be her support. Ask Abby to report the posts and get it removed. I\u2019m sorry this is effecting you in real life but if people are ending the friendship you should assume they are jerks and good riddance.  Beth can suck it too, sorry she is going through something but that is never an excuse to hurt someone else. Also trash that she is telling your personal information. She isn\u2019t a good person in that regard so nothing is lost with ending contact with her.", "Reading Beth as generously as possible, my guess is she assumed you felt the same way she does and finding out you *don't* feel guilty and shame made her upset and possibly even jealous.\n\nBut obviously, NTA. I'm so sorry this happened to you.", "NTA- you were a good friend to her, but she would rather have a villain to hate than to address her complex feelings. I tend to think she is projecting her anger at herself onto you. You don\u2019t deserve that", "NTA. I am so sorry. Your experience is the norm. Used to work in the field. The overwhelming feeling after an abortion in numerous studies is RELIEF. \nyour kindness was betrayed. Shame on Beth.", "NTA - and that is completely out of line from Beth! My jaw actually dropped when I read what she\u2019d written about you. Her anger and guilt are being aimed at you instead of her processing what she needs to. She needs therapy. You were so generous with her - I\u2019m sorry she threw all that (and more!) back in your face", "Nta", "NTA! I don\u2019t care how I or anyone feels about the broader topic but the way she treated you was not okay. I had a friend years ago that shared she had one and I had a hard time not judging her for several reasons but good grief I never told a soul, not even my husband whom I tell everything to. \n\nI am so sorry someone outted you like that. No. No. No. We cannot treat people with different feelings, opinions and experiences like that. You tried to help. That is all. If Beth felt so morally terrible about it, she shouldn\u2019t have done it. Maybe it wasn\u2019t the right decision for her but that has nothing to do with you. You were honest. No one has any right to publicly share your choice. I really think she\u2019s either angry with you because it\u2019s easier than being angry at herself or she actually wanted you to talk her out of it.", "BETH is the AH, not you. You are NTA.", "NTA oh my god how awful of her! She didn\u2019t like your support, so she turned it around and used your private information as ammo against you? For no reason, other than her own personal guilt? Atrocious, and your mutual friend better be standing up for you or I\u2019d want her cut off too.", "NTA X 100000\n\nThe absolute majority (over 90%) have ZERO feelings of guilt, no mourning period and the only emotion they feel is RELIEF.\n\nThis woman needs to get over herself.

I'm not ashamed of it and I don't regret it, and I'm very lucky to have been living somewhere where it was legal. I know there's going to be people hating on me for that alone and you're allowed your opinion. But that's not what I'm asking for judgment on.\r  \n\r  \nOne of my friends \"Abby\" told me recently that her friend \"Beth\" was about to have an abortion. Abby knows that I've gone through it, so she asked if I'd be willing to come over and hang out with them to help support her. I've met Beth a few times at parties and whatnot and she and her husband seemed really nice. I can't say we had much in common, but I liked talking to her! So we've been hanging out a bit more here and there.\r  \n\r  \nI don't want to write about someone's personal feelings, so I'll just say she hasn't been handling it well and I feel terrible for her. She and her husband have three kids already and only recently moved back out of his parents' house, so to be blunt this was an issue of resources more than lack of wanting. A lot of her questions have now started veering off into \"how do you go on after this\" territory. I've told her everything I can think of - one day at a time, getting back into routines, self care when you're able to, etc.\r  \n\r  \nWell yesterday I was over and she kept asking those same kinds of questions, like \"how did you deal with the guilt?\" and \"when does this grief end?\" I did my best to comfort her- she's in a lot of pain, I really sincerely want to help. She wound up snapping at me and basically said I was feeding her crap answers. She called them \"Disney lines\", and asked me outright how I personally dealt with the mourning period.\r  \n\r  \nAnd so, I told her I didn't have one. I don't like to admit it because I've seen people get really upset over it, but truthfully I didn't feel anything like that about my abortion. I don't want children ever, and my dad has always been really progressive growing up. Beth was going through something much harder, and I guess it just didn't phase me in that manner- it was simply a minor surgery for me. The money spent and work missed were the things I was most upset about. I tried to also add that I know a few women myself who have gone through this too and can probably relate to her more. I started to tell her I really just wanted to help and that I could see if any of them maybe wanted to meet up or maybe just weigh in on what they did, but she got very quiet and asked me to leave.\r  \n\r  \nNext thing I know, Abby is calling me to let me know that Beth has posted something on facebook about me and how I'm a heartless murdering monster. I don't even know what to think. I'm sorry this is so rushed, I'm just in shock. I've already been unfriended by a few of my other parent friends, and I'm thinking it's related. I'm not on facebook but Abby sent me screenshots, and they're...harsh. I guess I just want to know if I deserve it. So, was ITA? Should I have said something else?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Beth is a huuugge AH & I really wouldn\u2019t wanna be her. that\u2019s a majorly shitty thing to do. everyone has different feelings and lives. you shouldn\u2019t have to feel or have felt guilt. even animals will self abort when necessary in nature. it\u2019s very natural and she clearly took her pain out in the wrong way on the wrong person. I hope she sees the error of her ways, if I saw that post I\u2019d have some really horrible things to say to her & then we\u2019d never speak again. I\u2019d be the one unfriending her. who\u2019s needs ppl like that", "100 percent agree!!!\n\nHonestly, you sound really awesome and open-minded. Even though Beth is having an entirely different experience from you, you tried to support her. You tried to empathize. You were kind. \n\nBeth was so, so wrong for calling you out publicly when you were open, honest and vulnerable in an attempt to help her.

I gave her tips on dealing with the physical aspect of it, and we had a lot of long discussions about self care. It was mostly movie days at her home where we kept her distracted. Abby knew her much better, so I was following her lead.\n\n>You knew this as you talked to her.  Maybe not at first, but after a few moments, you certainly did, as you\u2019ve described above.\n\nI did not actually realize this until she started asking me repeatedly about my journey through grief. I thought the tips I was giving her would help her, because they were things I've heard other women mention who HAVE had that grief period.\n\n>My question is an honest one, why did you insist that she accept your emotional experience when it was obvious she was in so much pain?\n\nI'm sincerely confused by this question. What do you mean accept? She asked about my experience and I answered her question when she couldn't let it go. I wasn't trying to cause her pain, I thought I was answering what she wanted. Although honestly the post is a bigger issue than anything else.", "OP didn\u2019t insist that anyone \u201caccept her emotional experience,\u201d she simply told the truth about her own experience, which was different from Beth\u2019s.

It\u2019s horrific that she turned on you and tried to publicly berate you.", "Well, you were in the position as the helper. She was one one asking for help. Which means each of you had different roles in the moment.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t a ghost writer for your biography, needing to understand your details, she needed help.\n\nMy question is still the same. \n\nWhy when you realized you couldn\u2019t help her, did you continue to share your experience, when it was obvious that her pain was emotional?\n\nAnd this doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the abortion. This was a person asking for help based on your experience. \n\nThink of it as if someone needed help over losing job.\n\nIf someone needed help because they were fired, and knew you had also been fired, and wanted to understand how you were coping with the suddenness of being out of your daily routine, out of your friendship circle and having financial issues, while you although fired, have a substantial amount of money that had been left to you by your grandparents. You live rent free, because of a lucky landlord situation, and have all of your friend circle intact.\n\nThe point is, your experience sharing isn\u2019t going to be helpful to a person who is struggling. If you say to the fired person, \u201cjust relax, the money isn\u2019t a big deal, and something will work out with your apartment\u201d\n\nDo you see where the disconnect is?", "Yes, both are valid. \n\nAbsolutely correct. Both experiences are very valid.\n\nBut the timing for the person in terrible pain, is not going to be able to connect with someone who never felt pain over the abortion, can\u2019t connect on that level, and doesn\u2019t have any advice to offer.\n\nThat\u2019s the difference.", "OH, I see- I didn't say most of the paragraph that I wrote out into the post. I didn't literally monologue about myself lol! This is obviously paraphrased, but this was about my answer in the moment:\n\n\"Beth, I'm so sorry, but it was a lot different for me. After the first couple days I pretty much bounced back, and I can't say I felt anything like grief. I didn't feel like I lost something, I'm sorry. But there's a few women I've worked with who might be able to help. They've spoken to me about their experiences and I'd be happy to reach out and get it straight from them if it would help.\"\n\nShe asked me a few more times what I meant, and I kept my answers short and kept redirecting to my other friends getting into contact with her, and it made her more upset.

She expressed that she did not share Beth's feelings about the procedure but offered to put Beth in touch with people who did share her feelings of grief. She did what she could to help, then pointed out herself that she was not the best resource for Beth's specific feelings. Beth declined OP's offer, then had the gall to smear OP online as a fucking murderer.\n\nThat's the only disconnect here. OP is a caring, generous, empathetic person, while Beth is a backstabbing hypocrite who has no problem judging people for making the same choice she is making.", "She didn\u2019t offer advice. She offered support. And only shared her experience when asked.\n\nNTA, OP.", "Ah gotcha, she sounds like she\u2019s in terrible pain, and hoped to share that misery with you.\n\nPerhaps she was hoping that you, once the two of you were talking, that you would also feel like she did, because she feels so much guilt. She probably thought that you would also feel guilt, but \u201cwere living with the guilt\u201d and then she could use what she sees in you, to make her first steps into \u201cher living with it\u201d\n\nSorta like when cancer patients lose their hair, and some family and friends also shave their hair off. Everyone gets to deal with the loss together at the same time.\n\nMaybe she hoped you would share the same feelings she was feeling, and then she wouldn\u2019t feel so alone.\n\nObviously she shouldn\u2019t call you names, and out you on social media. People who are grieving do some effed up crap.\n\nFrom your additional comments, it seems like by the time you were aware of her pain, you tried to extract yourself from her guilty grip, but it was just too late.\n\nSo sorry."]}
