We bought a house, and are still paying off our wedding within the past year and a half (meaning plenty of debt). Most recently, I have been part time at my job for the past 4 months and has reduced our total income by a heap load, but thankfully my FT position resumed in January. In this economy we haven\u2019t had any \u201cextra\u201d money to spend, it\u2019s mainly poured into groceries and credit card payments. \n\nNow to the really problem at stake. My husband\u2019s parents just recently texted us their Christmas lists (lists that we did not request). We hadn\u2019t told them we weren\u2019t buying presents this year because we couldn\u2019t afford it. Their lists are filled with expensive stuff $150+ items. Now for a little backstory, last year for Christmas my husband and I went to California on a small but still expensive trip. So we also didn\u2019t buy Christmas presents last year as well because we thought a trip together would create more memories (we don\u2019t travel often). My Mother in law requested I buy my husbands younger sister (13) a Christmas present last year and sent me her list. Last year, I politely told her that we would not be doing gifts this year as it wouldn\u2019t be fair if his family got them and my family didn\u2019t. This turned into a 2 month battle between my MIL and me on how I was a controlling wife, and I could have easily bought something at the dollar general for his younger sister. I explained that at the end of the day, her $10 gift of useless stuff from the Dollar General shouldn\u2019t prove my worth to somebody and it\u2019s just the principle. I was mainly focused on my how my boundaries need to be respected.My MIL would tend to try to hold a financial string above our head. Now the funny part\u2026 my inlaws got ARRESTED for shoplifting so much at a local Walmart. Like I\u2019m talking the cops had to wait until they stole THOUSANDS of dollars worth of stuff to be charged. They are now banned from that store. Now the kicker, they had their 13 year old daughter (my husbands younger sister) with them in the majority of the footage. They technically didn\u2019t really go to jail they paid their bond/tickets and went home but have to go to court still. My husband and I found out about this from the local newspaper, it rlly came out of left field.After we heard the news we decided to set our boundaries between his parents and us because we didn\u2019t want them to think their actions were okay and tolerable. So, after I received their Christmas list I audibly laughed because it had to have been a joke right?It\u2019s crazy to me to just send a Christmas list to somebody who didn\u2019t ask for one specifically, especially to your broke kids.AITA for not wanting to waste a dime on my in-laws?", "created_utc": 1702085539, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18e28zb/aita_for_not_wanting_to_christmas_shop_for_my/", "score": 211, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel like we\u2019re not adult enough to be blowing money on Christmas gifts for our family yet \ud83e\udd23", "My whole family all does christmas lists.

I think the thought behind the matter was, his younger sister is extremely spoiled (like iPhone 15, newest apple products, and lululemon type of spoiled) and expects gifts just like her parents. Very poorly raised in recent years which is NOT her fault. I would rather her take her out for an experience like to go out to eat or do something together rather than around a lousy $30 on a meaningless gift. I just felt like I don\u2019t know where the line is at anymore between buying somebody\u2019s love and just SHOWING love. If that makes sense? I don\u2019t think my $30 gift would show her I loved her MORE than anybody else. Also, on that note.

Of course, we don\u2019t ask for gifts they are obviously appreciated! But, we don\u2019t expect fits from anybody. The shoplifting part was more of an event that happened where my boundaries are set because I don\u2019t want to be involved with them because they dont think their wrong doing have consequences. My boundaries were broken last year, so I felt like that was a piece of the story that is involved. Because we have made it explicitly clear that we weren\u2019t going to be around as much, because of that reason. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so boggled by the Christmas list.", "It was just a recent event that happened that resulted in my husband and I not associating with them to set boundaries. I didn\u2019t know if I looked like the a**hole, because we decided not too. The context was needed as to why we were keeping our distance. We were flabbergasted that even when they knew we were going to keep our distance that besides all they still had the balls to send us a Christmas list.", "lol it\u2019s not as much as you think it is. Our wedding was actually extremely cheap compared to $20,000 weddings.

However will Walmart recover. Who the duck cares that they shoplifted there. Of it was somewhere that it mattered (small shops) then yeah you can judge them. But from a multi million international company that routinely underpays employees (8% of welfare recipients work for Walmart), routinely so anti union actions, and area large contribute to  wage theft (the #1 theft in the USA.) They deserve no sympathy.", "ESH. Them for obvious reasons but also you for adding in info about the shoplifting. It wasn\u2019t really relevant", "That\u2019s exactly my point! I feel like I could take her out for an experience that would results more joy rather than a new hoodie or something of the sort. I guess when I buy something for somebody I want them to put it to good use or actually having a meaning behind it and not just a materialistic purchase.

Even if consistent shoplifting wasn\u2019t an obvious flaw, implicating a child in a crime repeatedly is still incredibly fucked up", "Stealing is stealing", "I don\u2019t care where they shoplifted from because I agree no Walmart as a corporation is not going to cry about the thousands of dollars they stolen BUT It is the principle behind the matter. They did something that had consequences and thought they were above everybody else and entitled to what they pleased. And lied about their actions until the cops showed them footage of the them doing it continually for over a year with their 13 year old child in the majority of the footage . They\u2019re raising a 13 year old child, I added that in for context as to why I thought it was absurd they were asking us for gifts when we put up our boundaries because of their actions.", "Something I do when I gift an experience is to give something handmade or small to signify the experience so there\u2019s still something to look forward to/ a suprise to open. Like I wanted to take my husband to the space center last year so I made him little themed tickets and stuck it in an envelope, or if you are taking someone to a painting class you could give them a cheap mini paint by numbers with a card explaining the date. Something like that usually goes over well in my experience"]}
