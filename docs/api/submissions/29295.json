I hope you're ok with your husband putting restrictions on your birthday celebrations layer on.", "Slightly yta. It is his birthday, so him wanting to go out with his family is normal. \n\nI would suggest a kid friendly place (something with a playground) so that you can both enjoy yourselves. \n\nI understand kids not wanting to sit still or getting bored once their done eating, but there are many solutions to the problem.", "YTA, it's your husbands birthday, all he is asking for is a dinner with his family. He is probably very aware that it is not going to be a super relaxing evening and if he is OK with that, I think you should just bite the bullet and just go. We always take our kids out ( 4 boys) and have done since they were tiny. It's really important that they get used to going out, how to order food, choose from a menu, have nice table manners etc. My husband always HATES taking the kids out, he tends to get very stressed but I don't. I would prefer to spend time with them on my birthday rather than leave them with a babysitter. If you neverctake them out for dinner they will never learn how to behave. Perhaps, you could do a 5.30pm dinner , be home for 7pm, skip bathtime and straight to bed. At 3yrs he is old enough to be able to be able to manage that.", "You are absolutely NTA. It sounds like you are the primary caregiver for your toddler. Your husband seems unaware of his child's schedules and general behaviour to suggest that kind of birthday celebration and dump the parenting on you, as if you were the nanny. It's also very immature of him to insist on \"his birthday\" with complete disregard for your concerns. IMO your husbands needs a rude awakening when it comes to parenting your child. Maybe you could pretend to be sick and stay home while he goes out with the family and the kid. Let's see how he will handle that mayhem.", "Get a sitter go to dinner.

If that's your approach, then you're in for a really shit few years.\n\n Take a colouring in book.  Put a movie or game on your phone.  Do you think your son cares when bath time is?  Take a pram if you have one.  Get him something to eat straight away.  Don't give him a sugary drink.  Who knows, he may just fall asleep.  Take him for a little walk outside.. or get one of the family members to.  Welcome to parenthood!  You can't control everything.

If this implies your husband will make you do 100% of childcare and not help, I would side with you here. If he's bring a parent, then it's his birthday and you're in the wrong.

It sounds like he's perfectly happy acting like he's entitled to have his life the way it was before he had a child, and that you're expected to bend over backwards to make it happen for him. If he wants to have a birthday dinner, that's fine, you can get a babysitter. If he wants to have a birthday meal with both you and his kid, that's also fine, he can have a birthday lunch.\n\nactually jk, the fact that you have a vagina makes you responsible for all childcare-related duties /s", "NTA - Sorry why would only you be responsible for looking after your 3 year old when *both* parents are there?\n\nAnd why is he choosing a time when his kid is going to be struggling? \n\nAn earlier meal is an option as is having a babysitter.", "NAH. Kids don't learn to behave unless they get put in those situations. It's a one-off for his birthday, so one night wouldn't kill you guys. But it's ok if you don't want to go. Going out when you know it's going to be stressful is the worst.", "INFO: why can't your husband take care of the toddler too in the restaurant?

He wants the toddler there so he should take care of them.", "NTA\u2026 my husband and I are taking our toddler to the pumpkin patch for my birthday because same situation ! And for his birthday last month we just had friends over to play games so their kids could play with our toddler and we all had fun and equally had to chase our kids around !", "Nta. It's his birthday? It's his CHILD he should know how the kid behaves at that time of night by now", "NAH. Your preferences are reasonable and would be the obvious final outcome in any other situation, but it is his birthday and he wants the whole family there. Warts and all.", "NtA and A Thank you from all the other restaurant guests.", "NTA- I wouldn\u2019t want the double duty dinner either.\n\nHave you considered getting a babysitter to go with and take the kid once he\u2019s eaten and starts to get antsy?", "NTA. You need to go take him to dinner at a soft play centre. He can have chicken nuggets and chips and you can have a sit down!", "NTA. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s husband\u2019s birthday, there\u2019s a child to consider now. Very few 3 year  olds will sit still for this type of thing. I wouldn\u2019t go along with it either, especially since you will bear the brunt of your son\u2019s activity.", "NTA, so you have two toddlers.... \ud83d\ude44", "Since it\u2019s what HE wants, HE is the one who gets to keep the toddler entertained and corralled NTA", "NAH it's a little self centered but understandable when you have kids.\n\nI guess it depends on if you expect this on your birthday, are you committed to effectively skipping your celebratory meal? If by your birthday it's somehow different, then YTA. If he cannot accept compromise then NTA.", "NTA But he wants to F around so why not let him. Find out? Go in separate cars and leave when your toddler makes his birthday unbearable. Hive him what he wants. It's his birthday", "NTA. Throwing a wobbler about not getting your way is decidedly childish. However, I suggest you compromise and take an activity/tablet to entertain your toddler and seat them between you and hubby so you are both able to control the situation. Depending on your child, I do think the time slot is a bit late.

Every patron expects to have a nice experience and not kids running wild as those places are on the expensive side. Once you know your kid can follow social norms? Move on to this type of restaurant.\nBut I would always suggest to start with kid friendly oriented restaurants. It make everything easier for everyone.", "Great suggestion. Any parenting tools you can offer would be welcome. We have 3 children. Toddler is the youngest.

(Wouldn't stay sitting for long either after eating) was an activity mat. Think those plastic ones you put under plates when you eat. \nI got a clear plastic one. And decorated with stickers, like animals, numbers 1-9, different coloured circles. \nThen, when she was done eating, we would \"play\" while I was eating \"oh mommy can't find the pink butterfly. Can you?\" Or \"oh, I wonder where all the cats are. \" \n\nIt kept her captivated for at least a solid 15 minutes more.", "I have a 2.5 year old. Honestly it seems really limiting to never go out to dinner with a toddler? I get it, it's hard, it's not *fun* per se (Type 2 fun, we call it) but I do truly think it's a skill to teach toddlers and preschoolers how to behave in a restaurant. It's clearly something at least part of your family is interested in doing on occasion.\n\nMy tips:\n\nOrder something your kid will like *immediately* when you sit down - side of fries, an appetizer, whatever. Try to bring your toddler there just a little bit hungry - not starving & hangry but not super full either.\n\nBring a purse full of small (non-noisy) toys they don't see often, crayons, a tablet if you're a tablet family. Pull out one by one.\n\nBring his regular water bottle - the restaurant might have kid cups but might not, and quality varies.\n\nOrder whatever trash from the menu your kid will like - this is not the time to push your perfect nutrition goals. Grilled cheese and fries? great. whatever makes them happy. And give them little samples off the adult plates, if that's fun for them - my kid loves to steal olives off my plate and it keeps him occupied for a while. Another great strategy is to order sort of tapas-style for the table - a bunch of appetizers (which usually come fast) and share-able entrees to all share. \n\nCommit to not ruining other tables' meals - when my kiddo is having a rough time, my husband and I basically take laps (outside the restaurant) while the other is eating, or while we wait for food to get some wiggles out. If you're with family (grandparents, maybe??) this is ideal because people can just switch off for 5-10 minute laps with the kid while he examines rocks in the parking lot or whatever.\n\nGet the check as soon as you know you're done ordering so you can make a fast exit if needed.\n\nHonestly this works pretty well for us - we get through most meals relatively intact. And if it's a total shitshow and your husband has a terrible time? You get to be *right*, which is truly priceless. win-win.", "Normal behavior for a young child but not what you want in a restaurant. I have kids and I don\u2019t like going to restaurants with them because it is a lot of work. So we do what you do as well. I wouldn\u2019t take him with you because you (singular) will be the one doing everything and wouldn\u2019t enjoy it. Besides, does he really want to throw your child off his schedule with consequences for the morning after and maybe even days after? NTA.", "Yes, that idea is sooooo brilliant!", "At that point, I\u2019d work on building relationships with 1-3 babysitters not in that group so you have options for when you need a fun adults night out. My husband and I don\u2019t have family nearby for routine babysitting, so it\u2019s forced us to find babysitters elsewhere. While initially anxiety provoking, we\u2019ve had great luck with Care.com.", "We do lots of eating out. Cafes and less formal dining settings. These are almost always done pre dinner as after 5pm he can become a wild child and it can be hard at that time in the day", "She does not say anything about a sitter. She just does not want to go.", "All of which are great suggestions for _her_ birthday.  Husband would be TA if they did not take the birthday person's wishes strongly into account.\n\nThis is not her birthday. It is the husband's.

It's like a magnadoodle only smaller. You basically draw on it,  press a button, it clears and you go again. It keeps both my two and five year olds occupied for a bit without giving screen time. They're available on amazon.", "I kept a \"busy bag\"! It was a smaller diaper bag. I kept books, crayons, and coloring books, I cut up sponges to make soft blocks. It was a great help for everything from restaurants to her sister's karate classes. Really, any kind of quiet activity could go in it, and I kept it in the car, so I could just grab it and go as needed.", "I completely agree!  You 3 yr old can sit still if you are prepared.  I took my kids to restaurants from birth all the  way thru.  We never had problems.  Children can learn to sit still- their age shouldn\u2019t dictate the life you have. Train them, teach them, show them.  Otherwise, you are bound to McDonalds until high school!", "You are doing nothing wrong. Your husband is inconsiderate :)", "This is not how three year olds work.\n\nOr maybe the three year old can go and the husband can look after his own kid?", "That is not how it works. You cant force a toddler to sit still just because it is his birthday. Both parents need to deal with that. Besides, it is fucking annoying for the other people with toddlers on a restaurant. They are not supposed to sit still for a full meal out in a restaurant. Which is annoying for the other paying customers.", "This is a great suggestion. I\u2019ll look into it thanks", "I mean truly, at that age, I think sometimes they *can't* sit still. But that's one of the situations you come prepared for. Basically my husband and I swap 10 minute mini-vacations eating alone at the table while the other takes him on a walk. It's not the family dinner we hope for - I love when we have a little prince who eats the best part of the appetizers off our plate and we all eat together - but honestly it works fine and it's nice to sit at a table alone and nurse a drink for a few minutes, too!", "Have two kids and have managed to take them out many times when they were young. Rarely have an issue. It\u2019s a few hours for one night for someone\u2019s birthday. Hardly a big deal. If it doesn\u2019t go to plan can always leave.", "I\u2019ve done plenty of toddler chasing, if I can do it she can do it.", "Same. I wouldn\u2019t mess up a kids routine regularly, but a one off for a special event isn\u2019t going to hurt him. They could pick a restaurant with a kids play area, and he could still be home and in bed by 9."]}
