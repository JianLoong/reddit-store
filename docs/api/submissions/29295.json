Honestly it seems really limiting to never go out to dinner with a toddler? I get it, it's hard, it's not *fun* per se (Type 2 fun, we call it) but I do truly think it's a skill to teach toddlers and preschoolers how to behave in a restaurant. It's clearly something at least part of your family is interested in doing on occasion.\n\nMy tips:\n\nOrder something your kid will like *immediately* when you sit down - side of fries, an appetizer, whatever. Try to bring your toddler there just a little bit hungry - not starving & hangry but not super full either.\n\nBring a purse full of small (non-noisy) toys they don't see often, crayons, a tablet if you're a tablet family. Pull out one by one.\n\nBring his regular water bottle - the restaurant might have kid cups but might not, and quality varies.\n\nOrder whatever trash from the menu your kid will like - this is not the time to push your perfect nutrition goals. Grilled cheese and fries? great. whatever makes them happy. And give them little samples off the adult plates, if that's fun for them - my kid loves to steal olives off my plate and it keeps him occupied for a while. Another great strategy is to order sort of tapas-style for the table - a bunch of appetizers (which usually come fast) and share-able entrees to all share. \n\nCommit to not ruining other tables' meals - when my kiddo is having a rough time, my husband and I basically take laps (outside the restaurant) while the other is eating, or while we wait for food to get some wiggles out. If you're with family (grandparents, maybe??) this is ideal because people can just switch off for 5-10 minute laps with the kid while he examines rocks in the parking lot or whatever.\n\nGet the check as soon as you know you're done ordering so you can make a fast exit if needed.\n\nHonestly this works pretty well for us - we get through most meals relatively intact. And if it's a total shitshow and your husband has a terrible time? You get to be *right*, which is truly priceless. win-win.", "Normal behavior for a young child but not what you want in a restaurant. I have kids and I don\u2019t like going to restaurants with them because it is a lot of work. So we do what you do as well.

Ask them to bring a small object or activity that they can entertain the child with for say 10-15 mins. Stickers are a good one as someone mentioned. What will the older kids do? Often the younger want to do a version of that as well. \n\nMy point is for the sake of a few hours - and a skill your kids needs to develop anyhow - for your partner's birthday, why not?

I also understand where you husband is coming from wanting to spend time together as a family but also wanting to do something normal that you used to be able to do without thinking (pre-kids). \n\nHave you got any way to compromise? Could you do a family brunch and then do a diner just the two of you? Do you have family around you that could help with babysitting? Could you just let him have his dinner since it\u2019s his birthday? Maybe go to family friendly restaurant and take him to a park before hand to burn off some energy? Maybe even make the dinner slightly earlier? \n\nI know it\u2019s something all parents struggle with and although we want to live a normal life and do things we used to do before.
