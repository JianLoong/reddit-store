A GOOD exercise to train saying NO.", "NTA. I think parents can get too wrapped up in their own worlds sometimes, especially parents of young kids. But it is perfectly reasonable to keep your distance for anyone of any age who is sick when you cannot afford to get sick. It\u2019s an AH move to get upset at someone for not wanting to get sick\u2014ESPECIALLY when your graduation has already been delayed once because of this exact same situation.", "NTA\n\nAnd it is time to put your foot down. Her kid, her responsibility. If she needs childcare of ANY kind, she hires them, or has baby daddy take over.\n\nNot your offspring. Not your problem.", "NTA. Not your responsibility.", "NTA\n\nThere's a reason your sister isn't getting sick. She's bringing the sick kid, traveling, for you to watch so she can stay healthy.  She can take that selfishness right on back home, and have the little be comfortable in his own bed and with his own doctor nearby.", "Did she leave your nephew with you?\n\nNTA due to the response below.", "NTA, and of course her BF takes her side.  Just politely say no and try to stay out of the house", "Totally NTA . She has no business foisting her sick kid on you\u2014and why is he sick all the time, anyway??", "NTA. Your sister is the AH for bringing him around when he is sick. That's something the vast majority of mothers would never do.", "NTA. Why is he sick all the time? Thats not normal as it is! \n\nAlso, be careful of food or other things she or the kid touches because thats another way to get ill. You need to protect yourself, which is not overreacting", "NTA. You\u2019re not responsible for her child, especially when you have something important upcoming like your exams. Her visiting does mean free childcare from you which it sounds like she\u2019s acting like. Good luck on your exams!", "NTA. Of course, it's very generous to look after your nephew, and the fact that you do it most of the time is already fantastic and she should be very grateful for that. That said, not doing something generous at every possible moment does not automatically make you a bad person. Not doing something good is not the same  as doing something bad.\n\nIt is simply not your responsibility to look after that child. It actually reminds me a lot of my cousin, who constantly leaves his children at his mother's. Sometimes, she's around them so much I forget she's not the kids' mother. He's not a very attentive parent to say the least. And, not that you need an excuse to say no, but in this case I think it was a very fair decision.", "NTA not your kid, not your problem. You don't deserve to have to be sick every time they visit.", "Maybe... if you have compromised immuno-health, it's irresponsible of sis to bring nephew, period. In that case, NTA, but in general, I think NTA you're being precautious, but also you need to keep in mind children get sick, and quite easily too so it's inevitable to catch something if around a sick kid. For some clarification, has anyone else gotten sick from your nephew during these visits?", "NTA based on the title. you don't have to if you don't want to, even without a reason.", "Info - can you clarify how youre being asked to take care of him. The subject is about babysitting but the post really doesnt address it.", "NTA. You are allowed to keep your distance to stay healthy. Your sister is being selfish insisting that you take care of your nephew and risk yourself every time she visits. She can take care of her own sick child, and plan her visits more carefully.", "Small children get sick very frequently and it's always rough for the adults around them who catch it. I N F O You say she \"travels\" back home--from where? If she's close and deliberately brings him over sick she's an A, if she lives far it's hard to catch a sickness before you actually arrive.\n\nAt any rate NTA for generally avoiding anyone if they're sick and you don't want to get sick.", "NTA. You could have said \u201cI refuse to take care of my nephew because I don\u2019t want to\u201d and you\u2019d still not be the AH.\nYour sister however, is a big selfish AH.

Save full family visit for a time your schedule isn't critical.", "It's perfectly reasonable for her to ***want*** someone else to take care of her kid.

Kids are an immense amount of work.\n\nIt is also perfectly reasonable for ***you*** not to volunteer to take care of someone else's kid, so you are NTA.

Children who go to daycare or school get sick more frequently. \n\nIs she getting on a plane this frequently with a sick baby ?  That's not a great parenting decision and I'm sure her fellow travelers can't be happy.  Frequent plane trips could be the reason the poor baby is always sick.

It sounds like mom might have either great health/isn't as involved/a regiment that keeps her from getting sick, so maybe you could ask her what she does to stay healthy? It's worth a shot as you are her kid, so perhaps what works for her will work for you too?", "NTA then (thanks) \n\nYou do not have to be a defacto babysitter for the kid", "Yea, you might have a point.
