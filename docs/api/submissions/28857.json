{"id": 28857, "submission_id": "1777bjx", "title": "AITA for not taking in a soon to be homeless friend?", "selftext": "For context, I (female, 30\u2019s) live in a relatively high cost of living city with few resources. I rent a small house, that isn\u2019t fancy, and it\u2019s barely in my budget. I\u2019m single and it\u2019s just me paying the bills. I also recently took in a family member who is staying in my spare room, and who contributes to groceries but not rent or utilities. \n\nI have a friend I\u2019ve known about 6 years, that I met at a class we were in together. We aren\u2019t super close, but I\u2019m one of her only friends who has stayed connected to her in the last few years.\n\nThis friend is finding herself about to be homeless, being evicted from her house. She has a disabling illness and has been completely unable to work or really care for herself, and is likely going to find herself on the streets. (USA here, so no real social services help and disability benefits take months or years if ever to get.) As her disability and health has worsened, she\u2019s also shown some behaviors that make her harder to get along with, and she\u2019s burned a bunch of bridges, so there\u2019s not many people who have stuck it out with her. I feel very bad about not opening my home to her, as I know she has nowhere else to go and will likely be on the streets. While I don\u2019t have an open bedroom, I do have a couch in my living room.\n\nThe reasons I am not allowing her to live with me are firstly that I rent, and can\u2019t have another person living there without amending the lease. And I don\u2019t want to do that, as if my rent is increased, I could no longer afford where I live as well. She\u2019s also a very difficult person to live with, is very messy and a borderline hoarder, stays up late at night to do things and is noisy, and talks nonstop for hours. She can be draining to be around for more than an evening. I also know she has no financial capacity to contribute, and her health is so poor that I\u2019d be cleaning up after her rather than her even contributing to housework. I paid her to housesit at my house for a couple weeks a while back while I was gone on a trip, and came home to a total mess and disaster that took me a couple days to clean up. It would be like I\u2019d be taking her in to take care of her, versus giving someone a place to land to get on their feet. It would be very stressful and likely challenging financially. I\u2019m also concerned that if I told her she could stay for a couple of nights, I would be stuck with her permanently.\n\nThis person is now upset that I\u2019m not taking her in to stay on my available couch, even for a few nights, as I have a warm, dry couch, and she\u2019s about to be on the streets, where undoubtedly her health will get even worse.

You do not owe that friend anything.", "NTA:\n\n31m here, late last year my best friend very suddenly became an extreme alcoholic. Lost everything but his van and GF, starting getting into knock down drag out fight with her (well she would, he would scream but somehow never struck the crazy bitch)\n\n\nHe came over for a weekend stay and I think he intended for it to become longer. After 2 days of him no evening bothering to shower (He was living out of his van, he was GROSS) I finally made him shower. My wife cleaned his laundry and Sunday evening I let him know he was no longer welcome. \n\n\nHe clearly was not interested in raising a finger, not to clean himself, help cook, or even to speak to me, just sat there and played Pok\u00e9mon for like 30 hours and smoked on the porch. I let him know I loved him but that I would welcome him back but he needed to stand on his own on some level first. I couldn't have that around my kids or stinking up my home. \n\n\nWe all *want* to help but the average person, hell, most people are not in a position to do that much good. At best you'd probably just allow her to get worse and shrug off getting better. I've been burnt so many times trying to help others and I finally realized it's best to take the feeling of a loss and watch it turn into a win later when they never actually get better or turn someone else life upside down.", "NTA.\n\nNo such thing as \"a few nights\".  Don't open your home to her unless you're willing to let her move in and start squatting.  Because that's exactly what will happen as you accurately predicted.\n\nYou don't owe this person anything, they aren't your dependent.  And they sound like they'd be both a financial drain, and a terrible roommate, not to mention you don't really have the space.  Her being upset at you is unfounded, and frankly if she keeps asking and being mad a reason in itself to stop contact with her.", "NTA - my neighbor helped out a friend to keep her from becoming homeless and she's still there 15 years later.", "NTA - you don't owe her a home. It's something she needs to figure out.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need a reason to not tale her in. That being said there are plenty of services in the USA for people like her.", "NTA. It\u2019s unfortunate what you\u2019re friend is going through especially in a country that doesn\u2019t prioritize addressing homelessness. But you would be risking a lot taking her in. Your mental health, your apartment, your peaceful living situation. \n\nWhat you could do is look for some services/shelters and suggest them to your friend. Maybe help them create a crowd sourcing link to help with getting on her feet. Offer help in other ways if you care about the friendship.", "NTA\n\nFirst off- your family member needs to pay you rent, period. No exceptions. You are barely getting by financially. You are not in a position to be providing room and board to anyone else right now. They either help out or they need to move out so you can have a paying roommate move in. \n\nSecond, do not let this \u201cfriend\u201d move in. You will be miserable in your own home. This person will not move out. They will mooch off of you and they will make your life hell. It\u2019s not your fault they are about to be homeless. It\u2019s their own actions (or lack of actions) that has gotten them in this position, and they need to get themself out of it.", "NTA\n\nYou can't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.  Your friend definitely needs help, but she needs far more help than you can give.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, if you let her stay even one night, she wouldn't leave.  Because she doesn't have anything else lined up.\n\nDoes your friend have family should ask for help?  Maybe you could help contact them.", "NTA- your own mental health trumps all- you already know it isn't going to work .\n\nEdit for clarification", "NTA.  She's not your responsibility.", "NTA - They would have brought down the vibe and potentially prevented you from scoring. No one likes a smelly dirty bastard.", "NTA, but I am confused.  You said you took in a family member recently. Then you said can\u2019t let your friend move in because you would have to amend the lease and the rent would increase. Would you have to pay more for a third person to move in but not the second?\n\nAnyway you don\u2019t have to take someone in if you don\u2019t want.  I\u2019m sure there are shelters that she can go to that would help her with her disability or find resources that are available to her.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
