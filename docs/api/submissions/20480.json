One of the last gifts came from my sister who\u2019s a pot stirrer. \nIt was a dual DNA test and it had a note saying \u201cpass this test and find out the truth\u201d years ago my wife cheated on me with her coworker. (This happened after my daughter\u2019s birth) All I know is the man was ginger and my daughter is ginger. However, there are cousins on both sides of the family that is ginger so yes it could happen. We never told our kids about the infidelity and I never had suspicions about my daughter. She was always a brilliant child and I loved her for it. \n\nI was hurt. I grabbed the gift and threw it at my sister and tried to kick her out but my sister was insisting on the truth of the matter to put my family at rest. My sister defended her actions by saying why would I want to invest in Ginger's future if she wasn\u2019t even my daughter. She said she doesn\u2019t want to buy my daughter gifts if it\u2019s not her niece. I noticed over the years Ginger didn\u2019t get the same types of gifts from my side of the family and I always just thought it was because Ginger was nerdy and they didn\u2019t know what to get her. \n\nMy sister eventually left leaving awkward questions and tears from the rest of my family. My mother defended my sister's actions saying we all just want to know the truth and Ginger is 18 now so as an adult, she should know the situation.

Cut off both of them; they don't deserve anything less.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you're in a really filthy situation which just got exacerbated.\n\nYour sister is definitely TA. Wanting to disown your daughter because she might not be *biologically* related is terrible. Her way of sharing it is terrible. It's all terrible. It's not really any of her business, either, is it? Oh, and now you're in this awkward position of potentially having to explain the outburst to your daughter. Wow.\n\nAs for your daughter, and this is beside the judgment for this situation, you should consider whether she cares. If she does, then take the test.\n\nI'm sorry for this situation you're in, OP. That's horrible.", "NTA.  You love her so that\u2019s all that matters.  The DNA test like 23andMe could prove a relationship or no relationship if the other person takes one.  I\u2019ve taken one with my dad.  23andMe told us we are parent/child.\n\nEdit:  just realized that your sister probably took the test and it would show family relationship up to 3rd cousins.

Just cut them out, they have been doing this for years, to punish your daughter, rather than talking with you about it. \n\n(Frankly I\u2019m a person to retaliate by demanding all those asking for a DNA test to do one first. See if any secrets came out [it would be beautiful if sis got a nasty surprise and didn\u2019t pass]. Though, if my spouse was cheating and I wasn\u2019t the one giving birth to my kids, I probably would have done a paternity test for my own peace of mind at the time [even if my kid, related or not, is still my kid - I need to know and  it can be relevant for health information too]. Heck, given how much I read these stories, despite my parents have been together for 34ish years, no hints or any suggestion of cheating, it was still a peace of mind as an adult when 23 and me came back confirming everything was as it should be).", "NTA.\n\nYour family sucks and your sister is a real piece of work.

G. \n\nI am so very sorry about this happening and especially so sorry for your daughter. What a horrible thing for your sister to do to her on her graduation no less. I can\u2019t imagine how she\u2019s feeling.. but it has to be hurt, confused, and angry. The damage that was caused at this party was disgusting to me. \n\nYou obviously forgave your wife long ago and your family should have too. Especially since it was AFTER the child was born that the affair happened\u2026 .. so it should have never came into question that she was yours! I\u2019m wishing(as I\u2019m sure you are too) that you had never told your family about the affair.. but that\u2019s water under the bridge now, but I have to say this is one of the saddest posts I\u2019ve ever seen because of the hurt and damage that child is suffering all because your family is a bunch of AHs \n\nNTA   \n\nGet your daughter in therapy immediately so she can sort out her feelings if she needs to.

Of course, that is up to you, but I am furious for you and your family to have to go through this.  I'm sorry your family is like this.  NTA for your reaction.  Mine would most definitely have been worse.", "NTA...your family sounds horrible.  If it's not been a priority to you all of these years, they should just mind their business.

She therefore really IS your sister's niece and your mother's grandchild regardless of the circumstances of her birth. Your sister also ripped open an old wound and hurt your daughter with information that has no relevance except to cause her pain and satisfy your family's morbid curiosity. \n\nIt is none of anyone's business that your wife had an affair or whether your daughter is your biological child. You and your wife have worked things out and that's all that matters. The only controversy that exists is your family members being instrusive and acting horribly. What your sister has done reflects very poorly on her character. She is the one who owes you an apology.", "NTA.  Is it possible to divorce your entire family?

Wow", "Anyone that would treat her as less than the other kids due to their own sense of \u201cright\u201d are not good people. You have lovingly raised her for 18 years and this was done in this way by your sister? What an intrusion on your family\u2019s privacy. This has nothing to do with her. Why do they want to judge her biology when they could see 18 years of life. Why judge at all? I can see being angry  at your wife, but this went to far, it affected your daughter. You would be TA if you subjected your daughter to your sister\u2019s presence again.
