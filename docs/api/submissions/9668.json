Marie has a son, Sam (17M). His father is not part of his life.\n\nI met Marie when I was 23 and we started dating shortly after.\n\nWhen I met Sam, he was 13 and he was pretty clear that he would never see me as a father figure ( which was ok. I had both a step-father and a step-mother and didn't like either of them, so I know what's like.).\n\nHe was initially quite hostile but I tried to be patient and supportive and he slowly opened up to me. We came to an agreement: instead of trying to be a \"father figure\", I would be more like the \"cool uncle\". I would teach him things, help him when he needed and be his confidant if he ever wanted to share his thought. I promised him that, as long as what he told me wasn't life threatening or illegal, I would keep it a secret even from Marie if he wanted. I never broke this promise, no matter what he told me.\n\nMarie and Sam have a great bond. She is an awesome mom and Sam love her and they spend a lot of time together ( to give the idea, imagine Gilmore Girl if Rory was a boy. )\n\nA couple of months ago, I and Marie went on a two days long vacation for our fifth anniversary. We wanted to take Sam with us but he insisted to stay at home and that he would be fine being alone for one night.\n\nThe vacation was amazing but when we got back, Sam was clearly in a bad mood. Marie tried to talk to him, but got nothing.\n\nI asked Sam if he wanted to talk to me about something and after a couple of hours he opened up and shared his thoughts with me ( it was nothing serious, classic teenager problems).\n\nThe next day Sam was in a good mood and I told Marie that I talked to him and gave him some advice.\n\nShe was initially happy but I saw she became a bit gloomy later.\n\nI asked her what was wrong and she explained that while she is happy the problem was solved, she felt a bit sad that his son wasn't comfortable sharing his thoughts with her.\n\nI tried to explain to her that it was normal: Sam is at that age where kids are rebellious. He is trying to become independent and to not rely on his parents to solve his problems. She understood but said that sometimes she feels that since the moment I arrived, Sam started to rely more on me than on her and that there was a period when Sam had no secret with her, while now I probably know more about his personal life than her.\n\nIn the following weeks, I tried to solve the situation. When Sam asked me for advice, I sometime suggested him to ask his mother too. He initially did and Marie gave him some good advices but thing didn't last and he came back to me. I see that my wife is sad that his son won't rely on her and I feel guilty. Did I steal my wife's spot as Sam's confidant?

She would likely feel the same when he is getting married and his spouse becomes his main support.\n\nJust keep being a great step dad and a great husband. It sounds like everyone is doing everything right, so hopefully your wife comes to terms with the changes and you can keep growing as a family.", "NTA.\n\nParents can\u2019t really be friends with their kids in the long run and she needs to be happy he has somewhere to go where she should theoretically approve of (I mean, she chose you. She should approve of your values)", "NAH, you're being a good step-dad, her feelings on this matter are natural and she's not taking it out on anyone. She's definitely not TA for feeling sad. I'd keep making sure Sam knows he can talk to his mom and also maybe you can help plan something for him to do to express how much he loves her.", "NAH. Marie has every right to feel sad that she\u2019s not as big a part of her son\u2019s life now. That\u2019s part and parcel of being a parent. Frankly, it\u2019s precisely because Sam doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re a parent that he feels comfortable sharing his problems with you. That and the fact that you\u2019re a male figure he can better relate to. Sam has chosen you, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with being there for him. Your feelings are always valid, even if they\u2019re not necessarily true.

He\u2019s a lucky kid.\n\nRelationships are tough. I\u2019m sure you and your wife can reach some sort of understanding about how best to approach the situation. I imagine she\u2019ll start to realize it\u2019s perfectly normal for teenage boys to want to speak with \u201cDad\u201d about stuff. That phase doesn\u2019t last forever.

You\u2019re a good dude doing good dude things.", "NAH. Everything has a season and his relationship with his Mom will change and circle back around in a new way. \n\nIt's natural for him to find other confidants.

Being a parent is just  heartbreaking sometimes.", "NTA.\n\nAlso....how touching is it to see a post on here involving step-children that isn't toxic! I almost teared up reading this. It sounds like you've built a great relationship.", "NAH. Marie can't help her feelings but I do hope she learns to cope with them, because that is one lucky kid. I always wished I had ONE person to talk to at that age. He has TWO.", "NAH. Everyone seems to be honest about their feelings and prioritizing good communication, even when that can sometimes be bittersweet.", "NTA the hardest lesson i learned as a mom was that my boys would always look to their dad to see what a man is. As someone who identifies as a person (i am biologically female, but only feel female in particular circumstances...otherwise i am just a human!), this was really hard because it feels like the modelling is pointless. Which, it isn't lol. But at that age he is going to gravitate to you because you are his trusted older male. Hug her for me. It sucks. He will also eventually be back to confiding more when he is older. Tell her to hang tight, and be happy you are there for him.", "NTA - he\u2019s getting in his teen years and mom is gonna take a back seat for awhile.  It\u2019s amazing you have become such a big part of his life, keep doing what you are doing.  She has every right to feel sad too, it\u2019s hard when they aren\u2019t so little anymore and dependent on mom.   She should just remain there for him when he needs it and when he gets out of that teen phase, the relationship they have will still be strong.", "NTA. The role of step-father is a bunch different from the role of mom, especially when you're halfway between the ages.\nIt's normal for mom to be frustrated by the fact that her hubby is also friends with her son, but nobody is in the wrong here: in fact I'd say the three of you are lucky.", "the kid choses his confidant, period.\n\nthe whole \"you have to share this private thing with me\", is not really healthy, as it removes the options and choice from the one who is actually making the decision, and should make the decision.\n\nnta", "NAH.

Mom has been the go to most of their lives but there are periods and times when I was the guy.

She\u2019s been the only parent for a long time, so finding out he talked you you about an issue, but not her, is strange.

I was in a similar situation when I was younger. The only child to a single mother who met a (at the time) decent guy.

She asked me about it one day and I told her as a boy there are things that i'm only comfortable talking about to another male figure.  She understood and was better after that, because I still talked to her about lots of things.

It is only a good thing for Sam that he also has such a strong relationship with you, and I feel certain you both want only what is best for him.", "NAH\n\nI doubt him not sharing some things with her at his late teenage years has anything to do with your arrival, the period she speaks of is something every parent has probably seen come and go, at that age you're sometimes more comfortable sharing things with people you trust other than your parents, it's pretty normal.

I am confused about what Marie thought would happen if she brought a stepfather into her son's life.  Once that happens, the stepfather becomes a de facto father to the children.  It may not be a great relationship, or it may be a good one, but it's still a fact.  Marie should be thrilled she has a good male role model in her son's life.  There are many things a teen boy is absolutely not going to want to talk about with his mother.  He is lucky you are there for him.

He\u2019s at that age where he\u2019s more comfortable with a male. Had your wife never gotten married, he would seek out another adult male like a friend\u2019s dad. And you have an advantage that most male role models don\u2019t have, your not that far from that age yourself so things have changed less than they would have for an actual father or a friend\u2019s dad.
