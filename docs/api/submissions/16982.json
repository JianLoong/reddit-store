Recently we got into a bit of a heated discussion because of something I pointed out. \nWhen I first met her, I realized she wasn\u2019t very social. She likes alone time, to spend nights alone (I understand because she does work a lot) , and isint very outgoing. She\u2019s not anti social though, just a bit reserved. \n\nBut she doesn\u2019t really have a big friend group. Myself on the other hand, I have about 25 friends. 10 very close friends. She only has two girl friends and the three of them only hang out like every other week. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s because I came from a small town where everybody knows each other, and comes from a more populated area. I did think it was a red flag though at first. Since I\u2019ve had the same friends since early childhood. \n\nAnyways, for her birthday last week, I tried to put together a party and I asked who she wanted to invite, and she only said those two friends. For my party, I\u2019m planning on having 25+ people. \n\nI said, \u201cthat\u2019s it?\u201d And mentioned casually when we talked about growing up in my town that a girl who went to high school with us got made fun of for only having 1-2 friends. She said to me \u201cSo it\u2019s a problem I only have 2 friends? People haven\u2019t counted friends since high school \u201c \n\nI wasn\u2019t counting friends. I was just saying. Before I met her, I was hanging out with my friends very frequently. They go out for dinner or have sleepovers every other week. MAYBE once a week. \n\nAnyways, AITA? I didn\u2019t mean to make her feel bad. I just made an observation.", "created_utc": 1683803015, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ek0qz/aita_for_making_fun_of_my_girlfriends_lack_of/", "score": 519, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s right, people SHOULD stop counting friends in high school.", "YTA. if you have to ask if you are the asshole in a situation where you put it quotes the words \"making fun\" you will always be the asshole.\n\nAs you get older you realize that her selective friendships are the way to go. While you have 25 friend and 10 good ones. once they get married and have families of their own that number will dwindle down over time.\n\nYour girlfriend has 2 friends only. If I was a betting man those two friends will be there more often than your 10 good friends.

Stop judging your gf\u2019s social life. \n\nOh and by the way: once people start getting married and having kids, the chances of you keeping close with all of your current friends is almost zero. Eventually most of us end up with just a couple of good friends, if we\u2019re lucky. So just enjoy yours while you have them and stop acting superior to your gf. She\u2019s happy. That should be enough for you.", "YTA.\n\nYou're not making an observation. You're judging her.", "YTA. I think it's actually really weird to remain friends with 25 people you've known since early childhood.  Suggests you haven't grown up much or matured since then, whereas your gf probably has.  Most adults don't stay friends with their high-school friends, or if they do, it's very very few of them.", "YTA, you are judgemental asshole. There is nothing wrong in having small friend group, those relationship is as valid as having big friend group. You owe your girlfriend a big apology.", "Yeah, YTA buddy.

Also, no one has 10 close friends.  You'll see later on.", "YTA. You're contradicting yourself, making it sound like you think she's totally fine but it's obvious that you find it very weird and not *normal* to have only a small number of friends. You even call it a potential red flag!\n\nSo no, you did not just make an observation you made a judgement. And a shitty one at that, cause who still gives a fuck about this social pressure to \"have lot's of friends\" as an adult!? Any introvert knows how that feels like and I'd certainly not appreciate my partner judging my social life by referencing how shitty teenagers are and then disguise it as an \"observation\"", "Quality over quantity. Just because you have 25 people in your group doesn\u2019t mean every single person has your back.

That would be a red flag to me.", "YTA\n\n\nYou judge her hard for not being you....", "YTA. Your post reads very judgemental. There is no numeric scale with which one can judge friends or friendships. She can have a small number of very close friends with whom her connection is deeper than any you have with your friends. Then again, she might not. It is unhealthy to compare her situation to yours and draw conclusions form that. \n\nYou bullied a girl for having 1-2 friends, and now you are bullying your girlfriend.", "YTA! She\u2019s an introvert, and is likely her friends are as well. She\u2019s right, no one counts friends after high school, and it sounds like she doesn\u2019t like crowds or attention.

I\u2019d much rather have 2 people I can trust to be with me no matter how tough times get than 25 people who are only going to show up during the good times.", "YTA here. Clear as day. \n\nIm just struggling not to laugh at the 25 year old man counting his friends. It\u2019s just the height of sadness. Some people have a larger group of friends.

Got it. YTA.", "A grown man just referred to crashing at someone\u2019s house as a sleepover. Dude.\n\nYTA here. If you make an observation like this there is always an implication behind it. And the implication is that it\u2019s weird for her to not have what you consider enough friends.", "YTA you made a judgemental observation and questioned something you know your gf was serious about.  If her social life is a problem then break up, or this is who she is and deal with it.", "Yep YTA, if you're ok with 20+ friends good for you but she's not you. Besides, I'm not sure you really do have that many friends, maybe aquaintance? . A good friendship requires a lot of time and work, it doesn't bloom in a day. If you're really splitting your time and attention in 20+ people then neither of them are getting enough of it to be an actual friendship.", "YTA. You like everything about her, except how many friends she has? Grow up dude, you\u2019re 25", "YTA. Your adult friend group has sleep overs every other week? What exactly goes on at these sleep overs?", "YTA.\n\n Sounds demeaning saying she \"only\" 2 friends.\n\nI really can relate to this situation since my girlfriend is the exact same to you, and I am the exact same as your girlfriend. \n\nI got 3 friends I would really count as a friend. And since all the new people are from my girlfriend side, they view me as +1 or as acquaintance at best. Which I don\u2019t mind at all, since I really need my alone time to feel comfortable. Too much interactions are just plain exhausting. So I rather have a small/close circle that I can keep up with.\n\nA big apology is due for being so judgemental about it.", "YTA. Not everyone has, wants, nor needs a ton of friends. If she has a few friends she wants to be with then that\u00b4s completly okay.", "YTA. I\u2019m so happy my boyfriend didn\u2019t judge me for not having as big of a friend group as he has. Some people like quality over quantity and don\u2019t feel the need to have that many people in their life. You sounded like you were playing a popularity contest with your girlfriend.", "YTA\n\nLook I have a difficult time accepting this was just a \"observation\". If I had to wager you probably have brought this up in the past. Your post reads as if she is lacking as a person because SHE CHOOSES to have less friends then you deem acceptable. Not everything in life is about Quantity....", "YTA, and need to grow up. You belittled your partner by comparing her to someone you thought weird. The clear lines of comparison are there you're just too immature to see them. She is right... What are you in High School? My social circle is huge so therefore another size circle is a, did you refer to it as \"not a red flag\" IE odd but not problematic- is a red flag. That is her friend group. Support it don't suppress it", "YTA. She\u2019s not you. She hasn\u2019t had your life. Drop it.", "Yeah, bud, YTA friend count doesn't mean shit. She could also be the kinda person who's always found it hard to make friends and has felt bad about it. Here you come, mocking her just the same as people would in the past. Unless the teasing is mutual and seen as a good thing by both, teasing your partner for trivial shit makes yta.", "YTA.  You were shaming your GF for having a small friend group.  She is not less a person because she only has 2 close friends and you have 25.  Some people have small friend groups and are not interested in collecting people to add to their friend group.  Do you even like your GF?  You are really showing her who you are with these snide comments you are making to her.  If not having a large collection of friends is a red flag to you, she is not the girl for you, especially if you are negging her.", "YTA", "YTA. \n\nMy dude, your way isn't the only way. \n\nGenZ people tend to have much smaller friend groups. \n\nWhat you said was really mean and shows a lack of empathy, and it shows that you are close-minded. \n\nAgain: The way you do things isn't the only way to do things. Are you saying (for example) your religion is the only acceptable religion? Your car make/model is the only acceptable make/model? \n\nAll that aside, if having a small friend group is a deal breaker for you, then you two are incompatible.", "YTA because you do seem a little bit judgemental and you WERE in fact \u201ecounting friends\u201c by pointing out her and yours exact number of friends in this post. It feels like you\u2018re comparing both of your situations. \n\nI fully understand how having little to no friends could seem like a red-flag to you. It\u2018s to me as well: similar to you I have many many very close and old friendships, am outgoing and social. I find it difficult to connect with people who have no social life and find myself asking why nobody would like to befriend this specific person. So I understand your point. \n\nHowever, you knew this about your girlfriend when you guys met, and you were okay with this. You understood her reasoning and were able to connect with her nonetheless. Why is it suddenly becoming a surprise or an issue for you\u2026? Why did you feel the need to point out to her that she has relatively few friends? First of all, she knows her situation better than you; secondly, there was no way this wouldn\u2018t come off as judgemental.", "A bit of an asshole. You're making it into a thing, even remembering that you thought it was a \"red flag\" not to have many friends. Saying \"That's it?\" is definitely more assholish than just letting her choose the number of people she would love to spend the time with and leaving it at that - especially as you followed it up with an anecdote about how not having a lot of friends is, in your mind, something people get made fun of for. \n\nThe thing that strikes me more is that you seem to think being with her is keeping you from your friend group. That's going to turn into a thing if you don't deal with your resentment about it and come to some kind of comfortable way for you to hang out with your big friend group often enough to keep you happy. You won't be able to make her have the same kind of social life you used to have/would like to have, so you need to stop pushing for that.", "YTA. Dude, seriously, she is right, nobody counted friends since high school. So your girlfriend is an introvert. That's totally normal. Why did you feel you needed to add that another girl who only had 1-2 friends was made fun of? That goes beyond making an observation.", "YTA dude.  It's not cool to belittle your girlfriend for having a smaller friend circle. Everyone has their own preferences when it comes to socializing, and it's not fair to judge her based on your standards.\r  \n\r  \nBy making comments about her lack of friends and comparing her to your own social life, you're undermining her and making her feel inadequate. That's not how a supportive partner behaves. Instead of being understanding and accepting of her choices, you're being judgmental and insensitive.\r  \n\r  \nIt's time to reflect on your behavior and apologize to your girlfriend. Learn to appreciate and respect her for who she is, rather than trying to mold her into someone she's not. Relationships are about acceptance and understanding, not trying to fit each other into predefined expectations. So, grab some spackle, patch up the damage you've caused, and work on being a better partner.", "YTA\n\nI bet she\u2019s closer to and shares more with her two friends than you do with your 25.", "YTA \n\nWhy do you give a crap? Not everyone wants a million friends and that\u2019s okay. Just like it\u2019s okay you have your 25 friends.", "YTA. You sound like a red flag here. Some people don't even have at least ONE close friend. Sometimes it's hard for some people to have friend. It's good you didn't want to make her feel bad, but you should be more careful about what you say. It's ok to have 10 close friends, 25 friends, like it's also ok to only have 1 or 2 friends.", "YTA. You owe her an apology", "YTA, you are counting friends, and you are a reason why a lot of introverts don't like extroverts", "I'm 24 with 0 friends. Literally 0. YTA", "YTA \u201cI wasn\u2019t counting friends\u201d is a really funny sentence to type after literally giving us a friend count break down. Seriously dude, grow up, you\u2019re cringey.", "YTA\n\nI guarantee her two friendships are more meaningful than all 25 of yours.\n\nProps to her for being content with herself and not needing to constantly interact with others to feel superior.", "YTA. I know you didn\u2019t mean to make her feel bad at all.\n\nBut YTA for not being tactful and sensitive, and not thinking before speaking. It\u2019s a good lesson for the future.", "Yta", "I have 2 close friends I trust with my life. Let me ask you something, if you were in trouble how many of yr 25 'friends' would be there for you? Yr gf considers quality not quantity. Also bullying a girl in school due to having a few friends is terrible behavior. Yr gf deserves better. Yta and very immature.", "YTA. \n\nI feel so sorry for your GF, being judged by someone who should accept her for who she is, or MOVE ON. \n\nWho counts friends? Who keeps a tally of this outside of HS? Grow up.", "I'm 28 and can count all my friends on one hand, I find having a large friend group as a red flag, to be honest. Nothing is wrong with keeping your friend group small.", "Yta your gf seems to be an introvert while you seem to be an extrovert. Not everyone likes to have 500 friends that they can just hang out with. . As an introvert myself we don't like having 20-30 friends.. Not only is that a lot of bdays to celebrate. How many of them can you could confidently say that would come to your recuse 100% no mater the circumstances. Some people prefer to have 2 really really close friends that they can always rely on and who will dive across the country if you were in trouble. And as someone who also grew up in a small town were everyone knows each other. Not all of us were friends with each other. There is always the two kid who were really really close to each other and only hung out with each other and did everything together. and I was one of those kids.", "YTA. Quality over quantity, meaning her 2 friends > your 25+ friends..", "YTA. Yes, you ARE indeed counting friends, and judging, and being immature and RUDE. I\u2019m surprised you have that many friends to begin with, given you don\u2019t seem to be very socially aware.", "YTA for saying what you said and for playing dumb now.", "YTA\n\nWhat do they say: A friend helps you move, a real friend helps you move a body. Her friends will probably be right there when she has a body that needs to be moved, just make sure you are not the one to trigger that. \n\n(joke, hopefully obviously.)", "YTA - So my 4 close friends would be a bother to you? Nah mate. Grow up. The older you get, the more you realise that of those 10+ friends, maybe one or two actually care about you.", "YTA big time. Why is it a problem for you if she prefers to have only a few friends? I'd rather have a handful of people in my life who I can count on to help me hide the body (of someone annoying me about the amount of friends I have, for example) than a classroom full of \"good times only\" people.", "YTA you\u2019re 25 and talking about how your girlfriend isn\u2019t having enough \u201csleepovers\u201d with her friends lmaoo", "You have sleepovers?

There's a big difference between the two.\n\nThe fact that you were \"making fun\" of her lack of friends shows a huge lack of empathy, understanding and care in your relationship, and potentially that you don't know as much about your girlfriend as you think you do. If you did know as much as you think, you wouldn't have made the comments in the first place.", "YTA because the non A response to her wanting her two best friends at her birthday is, cool - she\u2019s different and that\u2019s her vibe, and I love her just how she is. \n\nInstead, you made a comment that more or less expressed \u201cwhy aren\u2019t you more like me, what is wrong with you\u201d. \n\nAnd it\u2019s double YTA to be honest for how unable you are to see how the above is A behaviour.", "YTA.", "YTA - didn\u2019t your mother ever teach you that it\u2019s quality > quantity?", "YTA\n\nIt's not always about quantity, for some people it's about quality. In High School I had a pretty sizable friend group, but as I've gotten older, that circle has shrunk substantially as getting groups together got harder, and I started to focus on individual relationships.\n\nPersonally, I discovered that in that large group I always hung out with... I had maybe 2-3 close friends, people who would pick up the phone at 3am and drive somewhere to help me out if I was in trouble. Nothing against the others, they were great fun to be around, they just weren't that kind of friend.\n\nToday, excluding my partner, I have 2-3 solid close friends. I see them every few weeks or in some cases months (being an adult has some definite drawbacks). But when I do see them, it's like 0 time has passed, and I come away energized and happier for having spent time with them.\n\nI am very happy with my social situation. It fits me, it fits my friends, and I feel fulfilled by it. It is not better nor is it worse than someone having 25+ friends. If that makes them happy, good for them.\n\nYou are very clearly and vocally comparing your friend and social approach to hers, and making it clear you think yours is better. \"Just making an observation\" is a cop-out response when getting called out for saying something insensitive. It's like saying \"I'm just playing devil's advocate\" when an argument goes against you.\n\nRespect your GF's choices here. Apologize. Be a good boyfriend and organize a birthday event that is about her and what she will enjoy, not about you.", "Oh there\u2019s a red flag here, but you\u2019re the one waving it.

It sounds like you do that a lot.", "YTA. You can\u2019t possibly have typed this all out, where you mention a specific number of friends no less than  7 times, and refer to an approx number a few more times and then try to claim at the end \u201cI wasn\u2019t counting friends\u201d \n\nThat is literally ALL you are doing.", "Yeah, YTA. \n\nPretty much saying she would have been made fun of for having only 1-2 friends. Like its weird. \n\nSome people like having lots of \"friends\" - whereas some like me - prefer having a small circle of good friends. I have acquaintances, or people who in my 20s I'd party with, and am friendly with anyone, but to consider them a real friend -nah.", "Ahh are you sure you are 25? I'm 24 and if someone actually said to my face I have *this* many friends I would laugh. Like ok, so?\n\nAnyways yeah YTA \"mentioned casually .. a girl who went to high school with us got made fun of for only having 1-2 friends\". This reads like a kid playing mad libs and you had to fill in an adverb. You \"casually\" mentioned to her that another girl who had 2 friends got bullied? Why would you say that for any reason other than to make her feel bad? You say that you said it \"casually\" because you know it was a mean thing to say and you are trying to downplay it. Or are you one of those people who just likes to hear the sound of their own voice and don't think before speaking? Because it is one of the other", "YTA. While I also think having only 1-2 friends is a bit odd, I would never make someone feel bad for that in a million years, and keeping friend groups somewhat small is actually a good thing - quality over quantity. As you get older and you and your friends marry and start families, you will be seeing each other a lot less, and some of those friendships may well come to natural ends. That is normal. \n\nALSO - making friends as an adult is hard AF. Especially for people who are introverts. Do not judge your GF for wanting to keep her tiny friend group as it.", "100% YTA here which seems to be the overwhelming consensus here.

She is chill, funny, and kind. Recently we got into a bit of a heated discussion because of something I pointed out. \nWhen I first met her, I realized she wasn\u2019t very social. She likes alone time, to spend nights alone (I understand because she does work a lot) , and isint very outgoing. She\u2019s not anti social though, just a bit reserved. \n\nBut she doesn\u2019t really have a big friend group. Myself on the other hand, I have about 25 friends. 10 very close friends. She only has two girl friends and the three of them only hang out like every other week. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s because I came from a small town where everybody knows each other, and comes from a more populated area. I did think it was a red flag though at first. Since I\u2019ve had the same friends since early childhood. \n\nAnyways, for her birthday last week, I tried to put together a party and I asked who she wanted to invite, and she only said those two friends. For my party, I\u2019m planning on having 25+ people. \n\nI said, \u201cthat\u2019s it?\u201d And mentioned casually when we talked about growing up in my town that a girl who went to high school with us got made fun of for only having 1-2 friends. She said to me \u201cSo it\u2019s a problem I only have 2 friends? People haven\u2019t counted friends since high school \u201c \n\nI wasn\u2019t counting friends. I was just saying. Before I met her, I was hanging out with my friends very frequently. They go out for dinner or have sleepovers every other week. MAYBE once a week. \n\nAnyways, AITA? I didn\u2019t mean to make her feel bad. I just made an observation.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That's judging her because you are so ignorant that people are NOT you. As they say you do you, let her do her.", "YTA. You and your girlfriend evidently recharge in different ways. She needs to be *away from* other people to recharge your energy, where you need to be *with* other people to recharge your energy. You shouldn't be shaming her for that. One way isn't inherently better than the other, it's just how people are.", "YTA . Why would you make fun of your gf on something like this .. is it to massage your ego..", "YTA. Why does it matter how many friends she has. Quantity does not mean quality. There wasn't anything to \"observe\" in the first place", "YTA. You made an analogy to a girl who was made fun of for only have a couple of friends and basically made it sound like there is something wrong with only having a couple of good friends.

You say you wanted to plan a party but she only wanted to invite her two close friends and that's what prompted you to bring up the girl from HS in the first place. It's her birthday, she's allowed to celebrate it how she wants. The fact that you even bring up HS as some sort of gage for how life is supposed to go says a lot about your maturity level", "YTA Wow you sound obnoxious to deal with, I hope she dumps you so you have plenty of time for your \"25 friends\" and reminisce about the highest point of your life... high school.", "YTA, what was you intention in that comment if not to make her feel bad?", "YTA and you sound incredibly insecure. You need to do some work on yourself before having a relationship.", "YTA. Not having a lot of friends doesn't make one less of a person. She may have only 2, but who knows, she may have a lot of friends before. But those 2 are the only proven true friend over the bunch.", "It didn\u2019t sound to me like you made her feel bad at all, more like you\u2019re the one upset because her reply seemed to imply that you still have the same mentality as high school kids.", "YTA", "With friends it's sometimes quality over quantity. Also don't introvert shame her, you come off judgemental and condescending which makes you the AH", "YTA Does she even want this party, or are you throwing it for yourself?

Maybe she just doesn't like crowds or to be around more than a couple people, her social battery isn't as big.\n\nAt a time I had several friends, I couldn't count them all on one hand, but as you get older, and realize people's priorities, you lose friends. I have 3 people I would consider my friends. I have maybe 10-15 people I want to invite on my side for my wedding coming up. \n\nIf she only wants a 3 person party, that's all she wants. Having multiple people sounds exhausting anyway.", "YTA.\n\nAlso, I think it's way weirder to have 20 friends (like you) than to have 2 friends (like your gf).", "YTA.

Grow up.", "YTA \n\nWhat you said was very passive-aggressive and childish. Grow-up.

You said \"that's it\" which isn't an observation, it is a judgement. You then followed it up by saying you knew people who got made fun of for having that many friends.

And it really is a quite pathetic form of bullying/'othering' (plus, it diminishes the words for people who DO really need them). The deep irony is it's YOU showing the 'red flags', by thinking in that way. \n\nYour girlfriend is simply an introvert. Just because she has a different personality, and doesn't come from your town, DOESN'T mean there's anything at all remotely 'wrong' with her. To suggest she might be abusive/toxic/a major 'problem' (the usual situations that 'red flags' indicate) - simply because she isn't a carbon copy of YOU - is really unhealthy (and dangerous) thinking. That sort of mentality has been at the root of prejudice since the dawn of time. Just because it's getting dressed up in new words, doesn't reduce its ugly nature.\n\nLet me guess - you'd also be the sort to believe she was 'gaslighting' you, 'invalidating' you, and making you feel 'unsafe', for NOT acting like you \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f You really need to mature. You're caught up in the deeply unhealthy (and cliquey) mentality of accusing people different from you, of being 'toxic'. But for a man who still acts like he's the shallow high school bully (by believing the number of 'friends', is the main indication of 'success' in friendship - and indeed, somebody's 'normality' as a person), I guess cliqueyness is to be expected.", "You are counting friends though, you made it clear you have over 25 lol. YTA. Everyone is different, not sure why you need to make her feel weird for having a close tight circle. I actually view people with 25+ friends as a red flag.

Does this make us any less of a friend? No it doesn\u2019t, the frequency friends see each other doesn\u2019t matter in a friendship. The bond between them is what matters the most. \n\nI myself could easily say I have a bunch of friends but the truth actually is only 2 of my friends are actually my friends.

It\u2019s not a competition! Some people keep their school friends and others move on and make new friends. Neither way is better than the other.", "The only thing a person needs and usually has throughout their lives is one or two good friends.  For most people others will come and go.  I mean do you hang with those 25 all the time?  \nUsually when people become adults they spent the most of their time with their partner. \n\nShe sounds perfectly fine to me. You seem to have the issue with it.", "Oh sweetie... YTA.\n\nBut like, not in an intentional way, so redeemable. Just like you have introvert/ambivert/extrovert scale, people have a scale on who they consider friends and how they make and communicate with said friends. I've had this own discrepancy with my own boyfriend. Basically, it most likely boils down to a friend for her is very exclusive, and everyone else is an acquaintance, even if outwardly it would meet all of your qualifications for friendship.\n\nIt also sounds like she might have a smidgeon (or more) of social anxiety and she felt you were making fun of it. Regardless, I think an apology is in order and maybe a discussion about this idea so that you can see where she's coming from.", "Yeah...  YTA.  Not everyone needs or wants the same social life.  Not everyone wants to hang out with 10 people constantly.  Not everyone had the opportunity to make friends in grade school and keep them until their 20s.  Not everybody counts friends the same (i.e. do I know 25 people I could invite to a party?  Yeah, sure.  Do I count all of them actual friends rather than acquaintances?  That's a whole different question.)  And your girlfriend is right, deciding that having more friends/acquaintances rather than a couple good friends who you can rely on is VERY high school.  Implying criticism based on a social life she is apparently happy with is an asshole move.  Your implication is that you think you're somehow better adjusted than her because you know more people and see them more often, and that's not true at all.", "Yes, my dude, YTA.

Crashing implies last minute, end of night.", "I have 2 friends who would jump on a plane for me at a moments notice if I needed them. Those are the 2 who count.", "Bro, you're so awesome. Dude, I knew a girl who, like, only had, like, three friends. Bro, we made fun of her so hard. I mean, what a nerd, right? The football team is like, at least six friends right there, and bro, who isn't on the football team?", "Op likely is an extrovert and his GF likely is an introvert. From what he is describing. \n\nI haven't really seen people having too many friends as unhealthy ... unless they're prioritizing friends over more important things.", "And I bet when she breaks up with this bozo for being immature, those two friends are going to have her back and show her why she deserves better. Meanwhile, OPs friends will just bring him out for a beer bust and relish in their nostalgia.", "I never said don\u2019t count friends. As a matter of fact, I prefer dating people with a few close friends. A friend group of 25 seems wild to me and i wouldn\u2019t want to be forced to constantly hang out with so many people. Unlike OP, I wouldn\u2019t make fun of them for it either, I just wouldn\u2019t date them.", "Exactly this!!!! Me and my bf both chose to not have friends. We both have 1 friend each and we have both known them for years.\n\nMy experience with a large friend group is go drinking, gossip, hookup  have one or 2 chill nights and then repeat. I also hear alot from people where their friends dont like that they are in relationships or their friends dont respect it. My relationship is my number 1 priority because me and my partner want to build a live together and he will always be my number 1.", "She has more of a social life than me!", "And at 30 you\u2019re lucky to have two close friends you see regularly (and I\u2019m extroverted) I love them as much as any romantic partner (in a different way) maybe more jk. Op still has a childlike understanding of relationships, he\u2019ll have to grow up soon enough, till then he\u2019s still the AH", "I\u2019m 36 and I have sleepovers with my best friend! We order food and watch murder shows or King of the Hill lol", "Yeah this comment is judgmental AF.   \nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with men having sleepovers or valuing large friend groups.   \n\nOP is YTA for his comment to his girlfriend, for sure. But there\u2019s nothing wrong with having sleepovers.", "I bet you're just a \"brutally honest\" person too. Red flag...", "Works at a shoe store with his wife Peg and kids Kelly and Bud.", "Crashing just implies staying over to me.\n\nEither way, I don't see the problem. I definitely don't see it as a red flag that she has friends that she is incredibly close with. I'm not even sure what it'd be a red flag of.", "I have a solid 30 \"casual friends,\" if you will, and 2-3 true friends. People I've known for several years, and on whom I know I can always rely for anything.", "Right! He said she only hangs with them \u201conce every other week\u201d and I was blown away lol I would consider myself to be outgoing and even I don\u2019t see friends every other weekend", "There's loads of misandrists popping their heads up and it's hilarious to see the backpeddling when they realise its her having the sleepovers, not him.", "they were talking about his school and he described what happened to a girl _when they were in high school_. Right? Or am I high? \n\nBecause I am. I could be mathing this wrong.", "But he's still applying that logic to people he knows in his life now, and clearly implied that his girlfriend was similar to this \"loser\" for only having a couple friends.", " but the conversation derailed a bit about his behaviour back in high school too hence why someone else mentioned 'kids'.", "That\u2019s not how I interpreted what he said. It seems like the most extreme version of what he said is being imputed here and this seems to be a very sensitive topic on Reddit. \n\nPresumably that\u2019s because the ratio of highly sociable to unsociable on here is quite skewed and the latter are likely to be sensitive about it. \n\nAlso, I know, don\u2019t tell me, in real life you\u2019re the most sociable of them all and have many, many friends, so that\u2019s can\u2019t be it etc.", "The issue is that OP doesn't seem to have grown out of his high school attitudes about friendship. Whether or not it's typical kid behavior is entirely irrelevant to his worldview as an adult.", "Ah, so anyone who disagrees with you is a socially inept loser who's only commenting out of bitterness.", "Yes, but that wasn't the point the person you replied to was making or the point the user that person was replying to either. There were a hundred other comments to post that on."]}
