Not even being asked and considered for what turned to be a family trip is trully hurtful and will damage your relationship forever. Try to talk to a therapist if you can.", "NTA. You're perfectly within your rights to be upset at this. No-one else has the right to make decisions for you as they have done. Also, what a load of BS that it's too late to do anything about it now; it wouldn't be if they wanted you there. Personally I'd let those responsible for excluding you know without any doubt that if you are left behind that it will irreparably damage your relationsip and there's no coming back from it. Then ask them if that's what they want.", "NTA. A simple \u201chey would you also like to come?\u201d or if they were worried about finances they should\u2019ve brought it up to you and you guys would eventually work something out. They should be up front about it instead of just assuming your financial situation; if that\u2019s even really the situation why you can\u2019t go. You have a right to be distant since they didn\u2019t even give you the courtesy of voicing their reasoning on why you couldn\u2019t come to Germany. Also you\u2019re not overthinking it. You\u2019re hurt and you felt excluded. Even if you couldn\u2019t afford the trip, still being asked if you wanted to go would at least make you feel like you exist too. Your feelings are valid. Sorry you had to go through that.", "NTA\n\nAnd you are not overthinking it. If they thought that you would not be able to afford it meant the thought was there but when they went ahead with making plans without asking if you wanted to go, but would have to pay for yourself. Then they could have asked if you could afford it.  And now after not asking they are talking about it in front of you?? But they thought about including you and decided against it without consulting you about your ability to participate clearly shows they were deliberate in excluding you.  How did they expect you were gong to feel when you found out.  And why would you hang with them at this point. Apparently what they talk about is the trip. Its how you found out. How can they expect you to want to be around them and have this as a constant slap in the face. \n\nI think less of your step dad over this. His daughter always gets to go. How did he think leaving one of his step kids out of the plan was OK. And your mother..... This momma bear would have been all over that.", "NTA, this happens in too many families.  I would also pull back.  Set boundaries with them on what sorts of behaviors and attitudes your willing to accept and what you won't.  This tends to send a clear message.  It's difficult at first but like anything else the more you practice it, the less hurtful it becomes.  Your the only one who can protect yourself.", "My \u201cfamily\u201d never invites me to go on \u201cfamily\u201d trips either. It is really hurtful. Sorry it happened to you, OP.
