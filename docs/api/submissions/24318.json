If you constantly host these parties, and every single time, you have to repeatedly ask your sister-in-law not to do one thing and yet every time she does that one thing anyways, of course you\u2019re going to react. I mean, you literally even told her how to help if she really wanted to and she completely disregarded what you said about bringing wine.

You\u2019re the one who\u2019s put in the work of hosting these dinner parties, cooking, cleaning, planning, hosting, etc., and have made it a tradition. If you don\u2019t want other people bring food then they should accept that. If SIL can\u2019t then she should just not come instead of trying to do it anyways.", "NTA simply because you've repeatedly told her NOT to bring anything and she refuses to listen.\n\nIt would have been better to save the bread and tell SiL that you will give it to neighbours or sth. No need to throw food out, but I understand the frustration.", "NTA  \nEverybody seems to gloss over the fact that people at the table have allergies. Did you make it clear to your SIL that this is the case?  \nWhat if someone eats something wrong, gets sick, or worse?", "NTA - repeated reasonable requests have failed to elicit a grown up response from her - she is actively and deliberately doing exactly what you asked her not to - what kind of doormat does she think you are? If SHE wants to eat her food and brings it EXCLUSIVELY for her then fine otherwise - calling it a hostess gift knowing the hostess has explicitly asked her not to bring that kind of thing - she\u2019s an asshole.", "NTA. You've told her time and time again not to bring food. It's not a gift at this point it's a burden she continues to try and force on you.", "NTA. Three times would be enough times to piss me off as well.", "NTA. I hate when people bring food to my dinner parties that I didn\u2019t ask them to bring. This isn\u2019t a potluck dinner. You had a menu and she didn\u2019t even think to ask what it was in order to bring a dish that goes along with it. I would say E S H for throwing it out, but this is the third friggin time, she wasn\u2019t going to stop bringing food. Maybe this will make her think twice before doing it again.", "NTA - Whilst her intentions are probably good you've asked her numerous times not to bring food as you are cooking and people have allergies. You also gave her another option of something to bring. Maybe you shouldn't have thrown it away to save face, but i don't disagree that its annoying", "NTA. First time is an honest mistake, but after you spesficly told her to not bring food, she's being ignorant in purpose. Especially after she asked about wine. She's trying to make problems for you, I don't know why. \n\n\nI would note that you shouldn't thrown the cornbread, either donate it or give it back to her at end of the evening.", "NTA. No no but op don\u2019t you see? If she can\u2019t bring food which is expressively asked Not to bring then how can she brag that she was soooo helpful and good and isn\u2019t she really the star of this show? \n\nShe sounds incredibly self centered and inconsiderate. \n\nHonestly I\u2019d just stop inviting her.  And if anyone asks simply tell the truth: she won\u2019t stop trying to deliberately trigger people\u2019s allergies.", "Well, I'm going against the flow and saying NTA. I think you would be TA if you had not already asked her several times not to bring food.  OP stated that family members have allergies, and it could be due to allergies or in sensitivities to food that OP is concerned about as well as her menu. I have several family members that can not tolerate dairy, so if you bring something with dairy in it and they don't know it could really be a problem.  Also, the sister-in-law asked what to bring, and the OP suggested wine, and yet that woman insisted on bringing food again. This is the third time she's done it even after being asked not to.  Admittedly I would not throw out corn bread as I love cornbread and you couls send it home with her. However, I would be highly pissed if I've explained my reasoning to somebody to not bring food to a party, but they insist on doing what they want.  Remember, the sister-in-law is guest- not a co-host!  You follow what your host is requesting if you want to be a good guest.", "NTA. Allergies aside, it is disrespectful for her to repeatedly ignore a request from you as the hostess. People who haven't experienced hosting larger dinner parties and gatherings don't understand how difficult it can be to coordinate everything and ensure all the guests are catered for. Someone purposefully ignoring your request not to bring food throws everything off. Add allergies into the mix, and it makes things 10x worse because then you must be diligent about guest(s) not accidentally eating something they shouldn't, especially when you've taken specific measures to ensure everything is safe to eat for everyone.\n\nIt's a jerk move on her part, and she owes you a huge apology. She should also be grateful if you include her in future events.", "NTA\n\nYour house, your rules. You were kind, repeatedly, and said repeatedly to not bring food. Maybe now she will get the point.", "NTA. Maybe you should encourage her to host a big party, plan the menu etc, then you can show up and bring something tacky that throws the whole thing off. Perhaps then she'll get the hint. But cornbread? Really?\n\nIn the meantime, talk to your brother alone and explain to him that she's not helping, she's making things harder for you. Let him know that he and wife will not be invited anymore unless she stops bringing food. If it makes them or any other family members angry, that's their problem. Let everyone know exactly why you won't invite them. If that's not a good enough reason, too bad. Your party, your menu, your rules.", "NTA\nI hate when people bring food to an event I'm hosting. I already put so much effort into preparing the food myself and then they just waltz in with sometimes just store bought food. Ugh.", "NTA because your family has allergies and you want one night when everyone can enjoy themselves without worrying or having to ask: is there x in this? Is there any risk in this? That\u2019s sweet of you, and mean of her to insist in bringing stuff that could be a problem. \n\nWhat\u2019s her problem, is she one of those people who don\u2019t believe in allergies??", "NTA\n\nShe f'ed around and found out.  3 times she was told to bring nothing, 3 times she brought something.   She can host her own gatherings if she wants to show off her cooking skills.", "NTA\n\nThis is  a super passive-aggressive move on her part to get you to comply  with what she wants at your home rather than what you  want in your home. \n\nThrow it away or give  it to charity. If the elater, have the  charity show up WHILE she  is there. Meet passive-aggressive with aggressive-aggressive or it will never stop. Bullies never back down until you  make them. \n\nEither she accepts how you handle what she brings when asked repeatedly not to or she can not come...", "NTA. The wine request was a perfect attempt to have her feel like she's contributing without screwing anything up. You're a control freak about the dinner menu, but if everyone else is okay with it, she should be too.", "NTA. What part of \"Don't bring food\" is difficult to understand? She's being an AH possibly with the intention of painting you in a bad light to your brother.", "NTA.  I\u2019d stop inviting them.", "NTA, It doesn\u2019t matter about allergies or the menu, you asked her politely not to bring food, in fact you asked her twice, she is being rude by bringing food to someone else\u2019s dinner party when told not to.

Jiffy, which my family swears by, has flour in it. So much for the gluten-free folks.\n\nAnd, if for some reason the food is completely allergen-safe, what about the item it was cooked in?

Otherwise, you risk cross-contamination.\n\nI have a friend whose child has severe allergies, and I've seen the struggle she's had to find food that her child can safely eat.

It didn't have to be a big thing. \n\nI mean, sure she should have listened, but also you've made a big drama over something very small. \n\nYou're actually not being a good host if you're throwing stuff guests have brought out, even if you didn't want to serve it with your meal, it was absolutely unnecessary to throw it away. It seems like being a host is important to you, so you should work on making people feel comfortable. \nYou simply could have said \"thank you, it's not something that goes with the rest of the meal, so I hope you don't mind me not serving it, if you wanted some on a side plate I can do that for you\" \n\nPerhaps your SIL is a fussy eater and worried there might not be something she can have and felt like this could be a way to not make a fuss or put you out. \nPerhaps she's trying to impress the family and showing worth. \nPerhaps she's been taught you always bring a gift, sure I think if you've specifically been told not to bring food, wine or  flowers is enough. \n\nUltimately people bringing you stuff you don't want is a non issue. You making drama of it is.", "ESH - She should have listened when you told her previously that you didnt want her to bring food but if she feels compelled to bring something, to bring wine. You could have handled that so much better than throwing it out. There was no need for that reaction whatsoever.", "Edit: I'm editing my post to clarify a couple of things. I was one of the first 2 - 3 commenters and I could swear that OP's original post has been edited to include more information about allergies (and she's added more information in her comments). The original post that I read made a vague mention of allergies, didn't stress anything about severity and it more came across as OP being pissed at the SIL for \"throwing off the entire menu\". I'm not editing my judgement because my judgement is based upon that, more than the allergies and I feel that if these allergies were in fact as severe as OP is now making out, she would've included the information in her original post. \n\nOooh I'm going to be interested to see what the other commenters think of this one.\n\nPersonally, I think that YTA. Why do you care so much if she brings something? How does one person bringing a bit of something \"throw off the entire menu\"? You come across as one of those food snobs who'd shit a brick if someone asked for a bit of ketchup or mayo for their plate. You also seem to just be doing this because you don't like your SIL.\n\nAnd before you say anything about food allergies, it wouldn't be difficult to warn anyone with allergies not to eat SIL's dish.\n\nSeriously, chill out, it's only food.", "Yikes! You could have just sent it home with her. The cornbread didn\u2019t do anything wrong. This was just a \u201cwho can be a bigger AH\u201d competition. You won! \n\nYTA\n\nOut of curiosity what was the dinner menu?", "[deleted]", "ESH\n\nThrowing it away is a bit much - it is good food, and I'm sure there are hungry people in your community who might enjoy it.  Or you could save it for breakfast - cornbread warmed, with butter, and a cup of coffee or tea, maybe some fruit, is a good breakfast.  It would make your point - she's not allowed to bring food and demand you serve it.  \n\nThrowing it away makes all the \"don't waste food\" lessons I grew up with twitch.  \n\nShe doesn't have the right to expect you to serve something that doesn't fit your menu, or unbalances the meal.  And since you specified \"no food\" bringing food for the dinner is downright rude, and expecting you to serve random cornbread with your dinner is painfully entitled. If you'd wanted to host a potluck, you would have issued the invitations that way.\n\nThe only reason why this might be okay is if she one of your guests had a food allergy or gluten problem, and she made it with only cornmeal, not wheat flour, to ensure at least one thing that was safe to eat.  People with strict food limitations get a pass for making sure there is something they are 100% sure they can eat.  Because even if a host tries, they're not necessarily going to be skilled at making food that meets those needs. \n\nI'm thinking a kosher Jewish Friday night Shabbat dinner, which is generally a meat meal, and always includes challah, which is typically made with wheat flour.  A gluten free bread with no dairy, made to meet both kosher standards and avoid any trace of cross-contamination with wheat or gluten, is a bit much to ask a host to provide.  But that is a bit of a niche need.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "YTA - although I think maybe everyone is.

Another way to handle this would be saying \" thank you for bringing the corn bread but unfortunately we are having a stir fry and other related foods.
