They seem so happy together and she\u2019s really cool. \n\nOur friend group and our partners hang out every Saturday for dinner at someone\u2019s place and it was my turn this week. Since it was Lily\u2019s first time attending I really wanted her to have a good time. \n\nI started noticing that our friend Sarah was mentioning many of inside jokes and talking about things her and Jack had done together through the years (nothing romantic). The thing is, Sarah has had a crush on him for years and even though we have all told her to give up because he clearly doesn\u2019t like her back, she keeps trying. \n\nI could see Lily was feeling a bit uncomfortable and Jack tried to explain the stories to her but the conversation would shift to another topic without giving him time. \n\nThat\u2019s why whenever Sarah or anyone else mentioned an inside joke or a story I would quickly jump in so Jack and I could tell Lily about it. Our friends quickly realized that Lily didn\u2018t understand them so they apologized and stopped doing it but Sarah continued. \n\nAfter everyone left, it was just Sarah and I. She asked me why I didn\u2019t back her up during dinner and I asked if she meant the inside jokes. She replied I shouldn\u2019t have tried to force a stranger in our group because it would make the rest of the group uncomfortable.\n\nShe said I wasn\u2019t a good friend because I should\u2019ve helped her out. Another friend who also attended the dinner agreed that if I wasn\u2019t going to help her, I shouldn\u2019t have opened my mouth. \n\nI\u2019m feeling a bit guilty, but if I started dating someone with a close friend group I wouldn\u2019t want them to exclude me.

ALSO, once the others noticed how rude they were being they stopped too, thats very telling.\n\nYou did the right thing and are a wonderful host.", "NTA, you're  a good friend by helping out Jack.

Good for you trying to include Lily and shame on Sarah and your other friend. It\u2019s hard enough meeting new people, especially your significant other\u2019s family & friends\u2026 it\u2019s even harder when people are being a jerk to you on purpose. \n\nCheck in with Jack to see how Lily is and wish them well. Hopefully Lily doesn\u2019t feel discouraged by the cattiness and jealousy Sarah showed. \n\nHas anyone talk to Sarah that Jack doesn\u2019t return her feelings?  Has Jack?

Especially regarding this situation. \n\nLily is new & Sarah was intentionally trying to ice her out in hopes of getting her claws into a guy who hasn't ever given her a sign that he's interested in her. She was being territorial & a mean girl which you didn't allow to keep happening. \n\nIf I'd been you I'd asked *why* Lily specifically shouldn't have been included in the group? Why have other partners been welcomed, but not this specific friend's partner(s)? Why should *I* have backed Sarah up when she was acting like an ex who was jealous her ex was with someone else? & finally, why did *I* need to support her (the one acting like a possessive gf) over our other friend & his gf who weren't doing anything to make anyone uncomfortable like Sarah intentionally was?\n\nFact is Sarah needs everyone to stop coddling her like the friend who took her side. She needs to be corrected every time or asked to leave whenever she pulls these stunts. He's not interested & it may take him being blunt for her to get it, but it's not yours or anyone else's responsibility to back her up on her nonsense & bad behavior. \n\nKeep welcoming Lilly & don't let Sarah drag you into her nonsense.", "NTA\n\nYour goal was to be fair and fair you were. Well done!\n\nDon't play or support the stupid game of your friend. Starting this, with the sole goal to exclude someone is obnoxious.\n\nIf Sarah has a problem with Lily's attendance, she should say so or stay home. As soon as someone starts a relationship with someone outside of the group, a new stranger will be introduced to the group at one point. Does Sarah want to pull that crap every time that happens or only, when it concerns the guy who doesn't like her back?\nDon't feel bad for behaving like a decent human being.", "NTA. Help her out with what? Telling inside jokes? There was nothing to help her with", "NTA. Sarah is though. She's jealous because Jack has a gf, but you were being a good friend to Jack by trying to make Lily feel welcome. Being introduced to an established friend group can be terrifying!", "*NTA* \n\nSarah seems really insensitive and jealous to me. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong, you were just trying to help someone feel welcome and not left out. It would have been super awkward for Lily. You weren\u2019t trying to force a stranger into the group, you were helping a member of the group\u2019s s/o feel comfortable, seeing as she might be around more often. Also, you were trying to be a good host by making sure your guests aren\u2019t feeling unwelcome. \n\nSeriously, don\u2019t sweat it. You\u2019re NTA. Sarah is.

Does she expect that all of you will never make new friends and will stay single forever?  If she continues with this petty behavior she will drive Jack away, even as a friend.\n\nEDIT (because I\u2019m fired up): Sarah needs to accept that Jack does not want to be with her.  She can\u2019t force him to be with her and she shouldn\u2019t be trying to sabotage his relationships.", "NTA. Sarah\u2019s jealous.

They're enjoying the drama or they ship them so to speak. Either way, that friend isn't being a good friend to Sarah by not being honest with her. \n\nAs for Jack, imo, it's time he knows the complete truth. After the stunt she pulled by trying to ice Lilly out & then being mad at you for preventing it, he needs to know. Not only for himself, but to protect Lilly also. He already suspects & he deserves to know. It could be one on one or as a group, but I feel like he needs to know why she's behaving this way & that he's not just seeing something that isn't there. \n\nAlso, I'm sure Lilly noticed, too, so her crush won't be a secret for too much longer because she's getting bold if she kept trying to make Lilly uncomfortable even after everyone stopped playing along with her (& possibly the other friend's) plan.", "Well it's gonna be more awkward if sarah blows up about something stupid or actively tries to mean girl sabotage his relationship.  Sarah lost any trust owed when she made it clear she expects you to help her manipulate the group into excluding someone.  Might want to decide now whether you want the awkwardness of a private discussion that can be sorted out or an explosion when she takes things too far.  She's already shown she expects you to treat someone poorly just to help her crush along and will berate you for Being A DECENT HUMAN BEING.  I'd put some consideration into those facts to metric what she might be willing to pull to get her way.", "How someone behaves when things aren't going their way tells you much more about them than how they act when they're happy. In this case, I would definitely tell your buddy that Sarah had feelings for him, because he needs to address the elephant in the room. She needs to know that what she did here isn't cool and could cost her her friendship with this guy as well", "I\u2019m sure she may usually be really nice, but if she was doing this intentionally then it\u2019s very insensitive to the newcomer, especially if she still has feelings for Jack. But if she wasn\u2019t doing it intentionally, then I revoke my previous statement."]}
