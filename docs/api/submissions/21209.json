So again they offer more modest outfits for a reason. If it's a hooters brand shirt the manager cannot say a damn thing about it. It's a uniform shirt and he has no right to say what someone has to wear unless it's a out of uniform issue which it wasn't.\n\nJust your whole comment is gross fyi. You're defending a perverted boss and acting all the girls who work at hooters are doing it to be promiscuous when it's literally a job. That's it. Plenty of girls wear a modest uniform and/ still make bank because they are good at their jobs. Just saying. if anything hooters is in the wrong for putting their staff in danger with such uniforms.

It's tricky because he's the manager and he's in a position to make your life miserable at work. The way I see it, you have three choices. You either wear what he wants you to wear, wear the long-sleeved top and suck it up if he treats you like shit or you make a complaint to HR/his manager. Of course, if you do make a complaint, there's always a chance that he won't face any consequences.  \n\n\nBonus option (my favourite): Unionise. Get the other girls to wear long-sleeved tops.", "Ah. Well, NTA then. As long as you were abiding by corporate policy, he doesn\u2019t have a leg to stand on. If he wanted you to change so he could ogle you better, that\u2019s a whole other kettle of fish.", "Read your contract. Look if there is a sentence how you have to wear your shirt. Pervy probably only want to see you half naked for his pleasure", "Damn! That sucks, but tbf I was (mostly) kidding \n\nBut you should definitely report the creepy manager \ud83d\ude09"]}
