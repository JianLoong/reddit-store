So again they offer more modest outfits for a reason. If it's a hooters brand shirt the manager cannot say a damn thing about it. It's a uniform shirt and he has no right to say what someone has to wear unless it's a out of uniform issue which it wasn't.\n\nJust your whole comment is gross fyi. You're defending a perverted boss and acting all the girls who work at hooters are doing it to be promiscuous when it's literally a job. That's it. Plenty of girls wear a modest uniform and/ still make bank because they are good at their jobs. Just saying. if anything hooters is in the wrong for putting their staff in danger with such uniforms.

It's tricky because he's the manager and he's in a position to make your life miserable at work. The way I see it, you have three choices. You either wear what he wants you to wear, wear the long-sleeved top and suck it up if he treats you like shit or you make a complaint to HR/his manager. Of course, if you do make a complaint, there's always a chance that he won't face any consequences.  \n\n\nBonus option (my favourite): Unionise. Get the other girls to wear long-sleeved tops.", "Ah.

I'd contact corporate and speak with HR since the only one I see being unprofessional here is the shift manager.", "YTA, as a Hooters employee the host has every right to tell you which uniform top to wear for a multitude of different reasons.

This is why I\u2019m thankful I was with a union when a coworker tried to tell me she would make sure I never got offered shifts, regardless of seniority, because I said no to a very last minute shift because of something I already had planned. I was pretty mad because I very rarely said no I\u2019d they called me in for shifts.
