{"id": 23218, "submission_id": "15afg1v", "title": "AITA for not wanting to go to church on Wednesday nights anymore?", "selftext": "My husband and I have been going to the same church for many years. We usually go on Sunday mornings and Wednesday evenings. I was out of town one week and he decided to go on a Wednesday night. I spoke with him on the phone when he was on his way there and told him to call me when he got done. Church ends at 8 and it was about 830 so I decided to call him because he hadn\u2019t called yet.\n\n It rings many times and at the last min he picks up and answers the phone. I could tell he was in a bathroom because it echoed. I asked him why he was in the bathroom and he said he stopped by a Mexican restaurant for dinner and he had just had to use the restroom so that\u2019s why he answered in there. I asked him if he was having dinner with someone and he said no. \n\nMy spidey senses engaged and told him why won\u2019t you leave the bathroom and talk to me at your table and he said because it\u2019s too loud out there. I said okay well if ur alone then you shouldn\u2019t have a problem sending me a selfie with u alone and your food. He said okay and we hung up. \n\nI waited for the text for about 10 mins and when nothing came I decided to call. To my surprise his phone was turned off. For the next hour and a half and 45 calls later phone was still off. \n\nHe finally picked up and I am furious. After a good fight he finally admits that he took a female friend from church and her daughter to dinner. His excuse was he didn\u2019t want to tell me because he knew I would be upset. I finally get over it a couple hours later and forgive him. \n\nI usually don\u2019t go through his phone but did to see if they were messaging each other. I see there 80 messages in the recently deleted folder. I recover them and read through just to see if there\u2019s anything detrimental. There really wasn\u2019t anything sexual, just hi how are you and sharing scripture stuff like that.\n\nI confront him about deleting the messages and his excuse was he didn\u2019t want to make me mad. Once again we get into an argument about telling me before I find out is the way to go, instead of me finding out later. \n\nEvery Wednesday he asks me if I want to go to church and I say no. He asks why and I tell him I don\u2019t want to be in the same room as the girl that you take to dinner and message and lie about it.\n\nHe straight face says he isn\u2019t sorry because he doesn\u2019t think he did anything wrong. He had a friend from church and it\u2019s my fault because if I wouldn\u2019t get so mad about things like that he would feel he has to lie about it.\n\nAITA ?!?", "created_utc": 1690400203, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15afg1v/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_church_on_wednesday/", "score": 108, "replies": ["N T A  \n\nGirl you have bigger problems than going to church on Wednesday night.

You know this, right??", "NTA, he may not have had sex with her (yet), but he's cheating emotionally. The evidence is that he's lying like a Persian rug by omission.

Tisk.", "NTA- You know you have nothing to be ashamed of going to church on Wednesday.  I would talk to a priest or a deacon about your husband's action.

But he is having an emotional affair, and those can quickly turn physical, so why are you staying with him?", "NTA but I\u2019m telling you from similar experience she\u2019s more or he plans on making her more than a friend. You need to have a nice long talk soon about this.", "NTA - He is being shady as heck.

Listen -- If he's going to do things he shouldn't, he'll do them and learn to hide it better. You can't do anything to stop that. But what you can do is continue to be yourself and be the best version of a wife you know how to be. Go. Meet the woman and child, and hey! Grab someone margaritas afterwards.

Is it reasonable to make him prove he's not having an affair because he answered the phone in a restroom? No.", "ESH - his being shady is bad.

Everyone keeps blaming the other woman and making assumptions about her, without any evidence or information that she even *knows* he\u2019s been keeping their friendship a secret from his wife. OP\u2019s husband is the dishonest AH here who refuses to take accountability for his own actions.", "He is having an affair, or he is considering an affair, or an emotional affair.  Married men do not go to dinner with women and hide it from their wife, the same rule applies to married women.  I had dinner or lunch with work colleagues, I never hid it from my spouse.  Texting and deleting the messages, faithful men do not do this either.  NTA but you need to consider if you want to stay with a man who is ok with dinner and texting a woman and lying to you about it later.", "That\u2019s not his friend, babe. You know exactly why your gut is feeling off.", "Yo double check those scriptures they're quoting to each other if they're doing the \"Mark 24:7\" style instead of writing out the passage.

Out. Them. To. Everyone. At. Church.\n\nSpread your own rumor - have someone say they saw (husband) and (woman) out together and his wife was nowhere to be seen! (because reputations are everything in the church community). That and telling the pastor.", "The biggest red flag is the fact that she never came over to say hi when you did attend church on Wednesdays.  She was hiding it from you as much as he was.  If she thought they were just friends she would be happy to come meet his wife.", "Have you considered that maybe the other woman isn\u2019t aware that he\u2019s been keeping their friendship a secret? OP\u2019s husband is the AH, but it\u2019s wrong to accuse the other woman without more information.", "This!!! OP can meet the woman, get to know her and gain a better understanding of the situation. If the woman needs a friend to talk to about spirituality and the church, maybe OP can become that friend.", "Its super sus' that he hasn't introduced his 'friend' to his own wife...", ".......I just saw that.\n\nOkay, changed my vote lmao", "\u201cAnd his fruit was sweet to the roof of my mouth\u201d.", "There is a strong suspicion that he is attempting a dating relationship, but there is no solid evidence of such (yet). Spreading rumors and trying to ruin someone\u2019s reputation is an AH thing to do without proof, especially if the church is an important part of their lives. OP hasn\u2019t said anything negative about the other woman involved and it would be cruel to \u201cout\u201d her for intentions that she might not have. She\u2019s a single mother who may value having a friend from church to discuss and share her spirituality, and might not know that he has been hiding their friendship from his wife. For many people, church is literally a sanctuary and a safe space they rely on for support, community and spiritual guidance. Twisting that into a negative place can be traumatic and cruel if there is no direct evidence of misdeeds on behalf of the other woman. Additionally, rumors will start about OP as well, and they risk losing their own comfort / safety at their church. \n\nI agree that speaking to the pastor privately could help OP and her husband work through this, but intentionally ruining someone\u2019s reputation without credible evidence is juvenile and inappropriate. This isn\u2019t High School.", "She wouldn't be directly accusing, that's the beauty of it. And if the other woman is in the dark, this is the perfect opportunity for her to find out.", "His friend goes to the same church OP goes to twice a week!", "NTA but you need to get more information before jumping to conclusions. Meet this woman. Have an open and honest conversation with your husband. Blowing up his phone and making emotional accusations is not going to lead you to the truth.", "> ... if I wouldn\u2019t get so mad about things like that he would feel he has to lie about it.\n\nLOL, right, it's *your* fault he lies.  What an asshole.\n\nI bet anything the \"scriptures\" they share via text are code for something else entirely.\n\nNTA", "Women will pounce on men they see as \u201csingle\u201d ie by themselves at church. If Christian ,they will use the excuse that you and husband are \u201cunequally yoked\u201d to mean that sleeping with each other is , I.e commit adultery is fine. Honestly, he is looking for a way out.

What are we even doing here sis?\n\nEdit for context - you're NTA...RUN!!!", "If everything's on the up-and-up, why is he lying?\n\nSeriously, tell him it's couples counseling or a divorce attorney, because something stinks.\n\nNTA.", "Both y'all are seriously messed up.  45 calls is beyond excessive; he lied to you about the dinner; you don't want to be in the same room as his friend so you're basically pushing them together; you're trying to control him; etc., etc., etc.  ESH.", "Any one that goes through someone else\u2019s phone is an asshole. \n\nYTA", "I doubt there is an affair if he keeps trying to get his wife to go to church with him where the potential affair partner is.  Honestly I'm seeing more of a controlling partner vibe.  He's still wrong for lying, but it sounds like she has an issue with him having female friends.\n\nnm: she said she's fine with female friend and he lied for months.  Still don't see why he would want his wife to come to church on Wednesdays though if that's when he cheats on her.", "OP doesn't need to introduce herself.  The woman already knows that her lover or would-be lover is married to OP.", "Yeah, no wonder why he didn\u2019t say anything.  Probably knew it was easier to try and not say anything than to bring it up and have ole 45 calls be up his ass 24/7\n\nGetting real lying to mom about where you were vibes.   You weren\u2019t doing anything wrong but it just wasn\u2019t worth it to tel the truth and stir the pot.", "It's very hard to have an open and honest conversation with a liar.", "I never accused him of any affair I just don\u2019t like him hiring my sister!

I just came here to find out if IATA?!?", "That\u2019s just the un-deleted shit, there\u2019s clearly more going on here.\n\nI have no idea why these two people are still married, but this is officially a dumpster fire already and it\u2019s only going to get worse.", "> I doubt there is an affair if he keeps trying to get his wife to go to church with him where the potential affair partner is.\n\nSure he would.  It's important to him to keep up the pretense that he's living an upright Christians life, and that includes going to church together with his wife.  His lover or would-be lover already knows he's married to OP.", "Are you kidding? He is so straight up cheating it ain't funny.", "Wow I didn\u2019t even think about that but your right, never met her once. No introduction. I do remember a while back we were sitting in front of a woman and a young girl. When we are asked to shake hands with someone next to you I got this really weird gut feeling that they knew each other and they were acting like they didn\u2019t.", "Or he feels the need to lie because his wife has the personality which would make it impossible to have his own life outside of the marriage and his only reprieve he feels the need to lie about. \n\nEver lie to your mom as a kid when she asked where you were ?  It wasn\u2019t always bad or getting into trouble but you know it would be blown out of proportion if you told the truth.", "Consider telling him you're not going on Wednesday, then following a few minutes later and sit in the back or off to the side and watching. Depending on how he acts if you see him walking out with her just walk up to him inside the church and ask if this is his new girlfriend he's cheating with? Embarrass him right there in church and make sure the AP and every one else around him knows what he's doing.", "You are not the asshole.\n\n> and feel like I\u2019m losing my mind.\n \nThat's how he wants you to feel.  Are you familiar with the term \"gaslighting\"?  When he said it's *your* fault that he lies, he was gaslighting you.", "I would agree, if he didn't keep trying to get her to come with him.  It just seems REALLY WIERD to be like \"hey mistress, let's meet up every Wednesday, do you mind if I bring my wife?\"", "I'm sorry but that sounds like an affair. You may need to consider how to find more info and what to do from there.", "And what happens if they *are* only friends? OP will be the one embarrassed and the rumors will spread that she\u2019s a paranoid, jealous wife with a troubled marriage. Who wins in this situation? \n\nNo one, except the nosy gossipers who will enjoy the moment to laugh behind her back.", "Is the \u201cbeauty of it\u201d that the (possibly innocent) woman is confused, hurt and intimidated by a woman in church that she\u2019s never met? And if she\u2019s innocent, how would she even know that she\u2019s being stared at, or that other people may have noticed and formed unfair and negative opinions towards her? The \u201cperfect opportunity\u201d for her would be when OP introduces herself to the woman and informs her that she\u2019s the man\u2019s wife and inquires about their new friendship.", "He totally is!!! She details in the other post how he hired her sister to work for his business behind her back and would make snide comments about how much she helps him while he is texting her at 2am!!! This man is absolutely gaslighting her into thinking she's just controlling and jealous!", "My comment was \"depending on how he acts\" OP can decide how to approach her husband. \n\nIf husband is keeping his hands to himself OP can just walk up and introduce herself as his wife, if husband is acting more like a BF then OP can decide how she wants to handle it. \n\nOr OP can decide to not approach husband at all and just follow him when he leaves."]}
