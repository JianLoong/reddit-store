THAT **YOU** PAID FOR\n\nthis is honestly starting to sound abusive..

Oh honey, I'm so sorry your father is so terrible to you. His behavior towards you is abusive and it's not your fault and you don't deserve any of it. I don't blame you for your reaction to him smashing your Xbox and controller that you'd worked hard to purchase and it had meant a lot to you. It was beyond awful of him to do that, and he did it because he knew it would hurt you. I don't know your entire story, or what your plans for the future are, but I hope you get out of that house, I hope you make a wonderful home for yourself where you can live the way you'd like, and the people you keep in your life love and cherish you as you are (and respect you, your needs, your work and your possessions, of course).", "NTA. No matter the cause of the friction, nobody should be smashing anyone\u2019s belongings. Nobody should be overlooking how that made you feel.\n\nYour dad is a bullying asshole, and your mum is ignoring your hurt. It does matter to you.\n\nNot sure what you can do about it, given that you are living with them. I\u2019d find that very difficult to forgive.", "NTA- I also would not be speaking to a grown man who breaks things and throws tantrums like a toddler. Stay strong and don\u2019t speak to him ever again. Get out of that house as soon as you can and never speak another word to him until he gets therapy for his immature anger.", "NTA and going forward, I would google grey rocking and employ that technique with your father.  I'd stay out of the way and try to get out of there as fast as possible.", "NTA\n\nYou went without to buy that controller, it was really important to you & your Dad smashed it to pieces for no reason. Not ok.\n\nHe threatened you & he's ab*$***, very not ok.\n\nYou're completely pulling your weight with chores. Dealing with mental health challenges.\n\nIs there a trusted extended family member you could stay with where you feel safe & ok?\n\nYou say 'quid' which suggests you're in the UK?This sounds like safeguarding level stuff & their social services should be able to help if you've no one else you can turn to.", "This is abuse. Is there anywhere safe you can go?  \n\n\nAre you attending school/college? Tell a teacher what happened. They will protect you.", "Nta.\n\nNo adult should ever deliberately break something or someone else's. Never. Absolutely never.", "Nta, I'd buy a camera for your room to be honest.
