My younger siblings are Jaz (18f), Dre (17m), Ro (15m), Jai (12m) and Tia (10f). My parents had high expectations for me. I was supposed to set a perfect example for my younger siblings. I was expected to be the perfect daughter, sister, granddaughter, niece and cousin. My grades needed to be perfect so that meant no struggling with school, which sadly was impossible and school was not fun for me for that reason. It has long been suspected I have learning disabilities but my parents ignored those. I was expected to have perfect behavior. I was expected to sacrifice for my siblings. I was expected to always be doting and to put my siblings before everyone else. I was supposed to take over most of the chores and offer to do them for my siblings. \n\nI wasn't perfect like they demanded and my parents were hard on me for it. There were many times where I was yelled at until my parents were practically spitting everywhere because my grades were bad or because the teacher was concerned about my struggles and wanted to see them. Most of the time I didn't want to do my siblings chores. My siblings wanted so much from me and I found it too much. When I wanted them to back off there was more yelling and being told I was not doing my duty as the oldest.\n\nJaz and Dre were my two siblings I struggled with the most. I explained how hard things were for me and they didn't care they just wanted me to keep doing stuff for them. Jaz expected me to always be there, to continue living at home after I turned 18. In our community that is not too unusual and especially now in this economy it happens a lot. But I moved out right before the shelter in place order was given at the start of the pandemic. I knew it was coming and living with strangers sounded better than living with my family. Luckily I was able to live with friends instead.\n\nI still saw my family after I moved out but it was honestly not easy and I stayed away more often than I saw them. I got a lot of shit for it but it was better for me. Part of me needed to stay away too because I never graduated high school because my grades were so bad and I was bitter that my parents ignored the help schools said I needed.\n\nJaz is now pregnant and I am being blamed for leaving and not being there to set a good example. Jaz told me this too when she confronted me face to face. She said I was supposed to be there for her and I should have never moved out. All kinds of accusations about abandoning her and how it was my duty to be there, etc. I lost it and I told her I didn't want to be there for her and I was so glad to be away from them because all they did was take from me. I told her I wanted them all to leave me alone. She burst into tears and I walked away and ever since my parents, Jaz and Dre have been texting that I was such an ass to my pregnant sister and how could I. I had to block them all.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698315142, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17gt5wt/aita_for_going_too_far_and_making_my_18_year_old/", "score": 1186, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The extensive testing would privately cost thousands of dollars but is free to their students.\n\nIf they find issues, they offer assistance/training to teach you how to work around your difficulties. For example, if you have difficulty with reading comprehension, you can get your textbooks as audio files.  If you are distracted during testing, or read slower, they can arrange testing in a private, quiet room, and you can be given extra time.  They can teach strategies to learn in ways that are best for you.\n\nTalk to a counselor at the community colleges. You should be able to take classes without a diploma.

Acting on that info would mean your child would get help to get better grades in school and would be a better example. If that was your real goal.
