{"id": 29694, "submission_id": "17gt5wt", "title": "AITA for going too far and making my 18 year old pregnant sister cry?", "selftext": "I'm (21f) the oldest of six. My younger siblings are Jaz (18f), Dre (17m), Ro (15m), Jai (12m) and Tia (10f). My parents had high expectations for me. I was supposed to set a perfect example for my younger siblings. I was expected to be the perfect daughter, sister, granddaughter, niece and cousin. My grades needed to be perfect so that meant no struggling with school, which sadly was impossible and school was not fun for me for that reason. It has long been suspected I have learning disabilities but my parents ignored those. I was expected to have perfect behavior. I was expected to sacrifice for my siblings. I was expected to always be doting and to put my siblings before everyone else. I was supposed to take over most of the chores and offer to do them for my siblings. \n\nI wasn't perfect like they demanded and my parents were hard on me for it. There were many times where I was yelled at until my parents were practically spitting everywhere because my grades were bad or because the teacher was concerned about my struggles and wanted to see them. Most of the time I didn't want to do my siblings chores. My siblings wanted so much from me and I found it too much. When I wanted them to back off there was more yelling and being told I was not doing my duty as the oldest.\n\nJaz and Dre were my two siblings I struggled with the most. I explained how hard things were for me and they didn't care they just wanted me to keep doing stuff for them. Jaz expected me to always be there, to continue living at home after I turned 18. In our community that is not too unusual and especially now in this economy it happens a lot. But I moved out right before the shelter in place order was given at the start of the pandemic. I knew it was coming and living with strangers sounded better than living with my family. Luckily I was able to live with friends instead.\n\nI still saw my family after I moved out but it was honestly not easy and I stayed away more often than I saw them. I got a lot of shit for it but it was better for me. Part of me needed to stay away too because I never graduated high school because my grades were so bad and I was bitter that my parents ignored the help schools said I needed.\n\nJaz is now pregnant and I am being blamed for leaving and not being there to set a good example. Jaz told me this too when she confronted me face to face. She said I was supposed to be there for her and I should have never moved out. All kinds of accusations about abandoning her and how it was my duty to be there, etc. I lost it and I told her I didn't want to be there for her and I was so glad to be away from them because all they did was take from me. I told her I wanted them all to leave me alone. She burst into tears and I walked away and ever since my parents, Jaz and Dre have been texting that I was such an ass to my pregnant sister and how could I. I had to block them all.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698315142, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17gt5wt/aita_for_going_too_far_and_making_my_18_year_old/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This maybe was too far for me because she's young and now she's got a baby to think about. I lost my temper and I let out all the frustration and anger I felt and she's not the main source of that so I feel like that could make me TA even if she wasn't pregnant. But the fact that she is pregnant and my sister... I could very easily be TA.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your parents set a ton of super high standards for you without the support necessary to achieve them. The kind of things they were asking for, especially when it came to your siblings, is more in line with a parent/housekeeper/nanny combo and was totally unreasonable, borderline abusive. I'm so relieved you got out of there! Your sister's pregnancy is on her and the father, first and foremost, and then your parents, a bit, but has nothing to do with you, the person who had to run away and save themselves years ago. Keep them all blocked unless they can be reasonable, and work on building your own life with people who love and support you- you deserve it.", "NTA your parents let you down tremendously, and if anyone let Jaz down it\u2019s them. There is such a history of blaming you for everything that Jaz blames you for her pregnancy; of which you are right , you are not at fault. Nor are you to blame for getting tired of being a scapegoat and expressing your feelings. If the truth hurts that\u2019s not on you. \n\nStop taking the blame or giving them opportunities. Go no contact and block them. You deserve to be happy. Perhaps it\u2019s not too late to get a diagnosis and help for your learning disabilities.", "NTA; Family is not the unbreakable bond people make it out to be. They are using you, and give nothing back. I can\u2019t speak for what is normal in your culture, but I can speak for the fact that they are not treating you with the respect you deserve for the sacrifices you\u2019ve made. Live your life for your sake not theirs.", "Jesus, NTA. get the hell away, and don't look back. It is not to late, go get the help you need. I hope that you have at least someone in your life to lean on.", "NTA. What your parents did to you is called [parentification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parentification), and it was horribly unfair. You were a child too. You don't have a duty as the oldest. You deserved a childhood free of adult responsibilities, instead of being treated as a free nanny they could pass the younger kids off on. \n\nI'm really sorry for everything you've been through, and I wish you all the joys of freedom in your new independent life. Keep doing what's best for you.", "NTA - I\u2019d love to know how your parents (and sister) expected you stop your sister getting pregnant ?  \nWere you supposed to put yourself between her and the baby daddy ?  \nWere you supposed to go into the bedroom and put the condom on for them ?  \nMaybe they just wanted you make the appointment and take her to the doctor to get birth control ?", "I\u2019m trying to wrap my head around you being blamed for your sister having unprotected sex, which apparently you were supposed to provide the example not to do??? If you feel you need to make one last attempt to make them understand your point of view (probably a waste of time at this point) you could compose a text or email using some of the talking points this community has given you, such as them having high expectations without providing support, then send and block. You\u2019ll be the family scapegoat for the rest of your life if you don\u2019t cut them off.", "NTA and I'm so glad you got out of there. No need to keep in contact with any of them. Live the best life you're able and keep them blocked.", "NTA \n\nPretty sure all that crap your sister is spewing is actually your parents lack of ability to do their job as parents.\n\nGlad you got out of that dumpster fire! Tell them to take responsibility for themselves. You did, and you actually turned out better.... With worse that no 'good example', with family that were actively trying to sabotage you. Your out on your own and not having a baby your totally unprepared for. Congrats!\n\nLive your best life OP, and much love", "NTA. I am so sorry your family failed you so badly. Do whatever you need to do to protect yourself.", "NTA - it seems like you lost it a bit, and that isn't good. But you have the right to live your own life. it sounds like she needs to take responsibility for herself.", "Screaming at her wasn't helpful, but none of those things were your responsibility, even if your parents blamed you for them you need to do what's best for you. \n\nNta for leaving", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was my fault.\n\nBecause that's how it happens when you're treated like a scapegoat child growing up.  Something to be used up and treated like crap.  \n\nYou were not another parent in your household growing up.  You were a child abused and forced into that role.\n\nPlease do look into therapy.  I recently started and it helps.  I wish I had done it a long time ago, but I don't think I truly realized the impact my childhood had on me.", "NTA\n\nFellow oldest of six here.\n\nYou should never have been treated that way. You should have been allowed to act like the child you were, instead of being forced into the role of perfect role model and third parent. It is not your job to be Jaz's support. It never was. And your parents damaged the relationships between you and your siblings with the way they treated you.", "Hey there. I\u2019m also the eldest of my siblings. I\u2019m going hard NTA to you. It was not on you to be a role model for your younger siblings and frankly your parents straight up abused you. I know the eldest sibling ( esp if ur fem or afab ) are basically stand in parents to their younger siblings a lot of times but it\u2019s not fair to you for them to say you needed to set a better example for Jaz.

The lack of accountability of some people is astounding!", "Thank you. I'm trying to put me first now that I'm free from that house. But it can be so hard to power through when the blame always seems to be thrown at you.", "I was supposed to make my sister less emotional and therefore was the reason she made the decision to risk getting pregnant (their words) and none of this would have happened if I had been a supportive presence over the last three years and if I was there for her to help her navigate sex and stuff like that.", "That was their job, as her parents. They\u2019re ridiculous."]}
