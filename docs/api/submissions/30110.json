We have two kids, this conflict concerns our oldest (Jack-5yo). \n\nMy husband has a half sister (Ann-23yo) that he is not very close to. However, she gets along very well with Jack. She sometimes offers to take him on auntie-nephew dates which I allow as I do trust her. She\u2019s great with Jack and he adores her as well. \n\nAnn is getting married in a couple weeks. We were all invited, but my husband couldn\u2019t get time off work, and my mother will be visiting that weekend too so we won\u2019t be able to attend. Ann asked if we could at least let Jack attend and that she and my MIL will watch him. I was hesitant but Ann and my MIL told me not to worry about it. I agreed.\n\nThen Ann told me that her father will be attending the wedding. I was surprised because she hasn\u2019t had contact with him for years but they reconnected for her wedding. In my opinion, her father isn\u2019t a very good person. He\u2019s extremely racist and very headstrong about his beliefs. He is also easily convinced by certain kinds of media and before we even knew he was attending the wedding, my husband showed me his facebook posts and they were genuinely insane. Lots of generalizations about groups of people and justifying various horrors simply because of a person\u2019s skin tone or race.\n\nI told Ann that I don\u2019t know if my son will be attending anymore. She got what I meant and told me that her dad won\u2019t even be able to tell Jack isn\u2019t 100% white so I have nothing to worry about. I mean yes, my son is white passing, but with the current climate of things, I refuse to risk it. My son will sometimes speak my language and he is not 100% aware that he has to be careful around certain people yet.\n\nAnn got upset and told me that nothing will happen and I\u2019m being paranoid.

She then told me to think about it rationally as the venue is a public place filled with people. \n\nI apologized and said I can\u2019t let him go. She started shouting at me and said I was ruining her wedding. She wants to spend it with everyone she loves, Jack included, and I\u2019m ruining that by being paranoid. She then started crying, I think, before hanging up. My MIL called me later saying that she swears nothing will happen to Jack and to please \u201cget over it\u201d for Ann\u2019s happiness. I said no. She told me that she hopes I\u2019m proud of myself for breaking Ann\u2019s heart. I do feel bad, and I suppose I am being paranoid. But AITA?

Amazing. NTA. If your SIL actually cared about you or your son, she wouldn't be breaking bread with someone who would harm him.", "Something in your gut is telling you that this dad is a threat. You go with your mom gut.  This world is not Kumbaya, protect your kid.", "NTA\n\nSo nothing physically may happen, but what about if Jack overhears things? What if this guy has a conversation w/jack and spews his racist ideas? Why risk that?

Who gets this bent out of shape over a 5 yo nephew not being able to make it to their wedding?   She wasn't upset her brother couldn't go, or that you couldn't go, but \"omg you ruined my wedding because you won't let my 5yo nephew come!\" is a bit of an over reaction isn't it? Your MIL is a piece of work too.  She tries to guilt trip you saying you broke Ann's heart.  No you didn't.  If she is this fragile hearing the word no, imagine the world of hurt she will experience as life deals her one disappointment after another. It's coming.\n\nNormal reaction is to feel sad when someone you really want to come to your wedding can't make it, but you press on and  accept it.  \n\nI wouldn't send my 5 yo to a wedding neither I nor my husband weren't going to be attending. Don't feel bad about it.  Lots of parents would not even consider sending their small child to a wedding without at least one parent in attendance.  I'm sure your mom will want to spend time with Jack while she's visiting.  SIL's wedding will really mean nothing to Jack in the big scheme of life.  Not at his age.

She and her mother will not be keeping an eye on him during the entire ceremony/reception. I wouldn't feel comfortable sending an unattended five-year-old to spend hours in a place crowded with adults.  SIL and her mother have absolutely no say over *your* child.  You are making the call as his mother.  You have no reason to feel bad. If SIL wants to tantrum and declare her wedding \"ruined,\" that's entirely on her.", "NTA\n\nProtecting your son is never a bad idea.  She knows her dad is a racist and is \"ok\" with it.  You don't have to be \"ok\" with it, ever.  She is excusing her father's racism and attacking you for not doing the same.  You are not wrong here.  She made a choice and doesn't like the consequences of it.  I repeat, NTA", "If her entire plan is to pass your son off as white, that\u2019s incredibly harmful to your child. Having to pretend to be white to be around his grandfather is absolutely insane, and being exposed to those types of people/environments (even if he is unaware at this point) is toxic. Anyone who would expose him to that is toxic and selfish. You\u2019re doing the right thing. NTA.", "1000% NTA. \n\nA racist apologist is just as bad as the racist they're defending. And she wants your 5yo to be there without a parent?? Abso-fkin-lutely not. Good on you for protecting your child.

Nope. Nope. Nope x100", "NTA. It is your job to protect your child. You are doing that.

You're NTA, and SIL needs to get a grip.", "Your son is just too young to attend a wedding where there\u2019s a racist adult, especially when the people in charge of watching him are the bride & MOB.

My daughter was 4, my in-laws wanted to take her with them to a wedding that her dad and I couldn't get off of work to attend. I said NO. Absolutely not. Was called the worst daughter in law ever, \"why don't I trust them- blah blah\". On the way, the Expedition had a blow out and flipped several times. My youngest sister in law was trapped for 40 minutes. My niece was forgotten in the back seat, as her parents were on scene yet. My daughter would have been forgotten too. It took an accident for them to see, I had the right to be cautious. In your case it's about the very real probability of mistreatment.", "Does your husband's father not know *you* are Middle Eastern? How would he not figure it out? I'm sorry it's come to this, but protect your child. She is going to be getting married, not babysitting. She can't guarantee anything. She doesn't even recognize the danger. How can she protect him from something she doesn't believe is a threat?", "Her remark that \"don't worry, he can't even tell,\" strongly implies that there's something wrong in being mixed race and it's something your son has to hide. I think you are 100% correct in protecting your child from any racist assholes, even if they're in the family. That your sister-in-law and mother-in-law are putting the blame on you for this instead of the racist asshole shows that your son is not really safe in that family. Keep him away from them.", "Even IF he can't tell, the child is going to overhear some pretty awful stuff.  Do they think Jack won't connect grandpa's race rants with his own mixed-race heritage?", "Right, that\u2019s more my concern. They will be so distracted there\u2019s no way that can be making sure no harm comes to a 5 year old, whether with the racist relative or otherwise", "This was my thought exactly. I adore my niblings, but there's no way I could commit to the attention a 5-year-old requires during an event I'm hosting, much less a wedding! \n\nHe's going to be pawned off to other relatives/cousins, which in a normal situation could be alright (being upfront about it), but here OP doesn't seem to know the extended family very well, and there's the risk of the bride's father saying something unhinged. \n\nI understand the bride loves the little guy. She can be bummed he's not in the pictures (because let's face it, how much time would she be hanging out with him anyways) but \"you're ruining my wedding\" is a bit too far.", "You are absolutely right. He's 5 fucking years old. Even without all this, I would have some hesitation about the situation. The MIL is going to have MOTB duties. And there are going to be a lot of people there the OP doesn't know. Especially since they aren't very close to the bride. \n\nOP - do whatever you think is best here.", "Plus even if nothing happens \"to\" Jack, even if SIL's dad doesn't yell at him or direct any comments to him, it doesn't sound like this is a person who will be circumspect about his abhorrent views even at his daughter's wedding, and I'm sure OP doesn't want her child hearing that regardless of whether the dad thinks the kid is 100% white or not.", "yup, it's the freudian slip.", "Everyone she loves includes a mad old racist. Forget about the dad, I wouldn't want my kid around her.", "I doubt that. My son would\u2019ve told me. And while I\u2019m pretty surprised by her current attitude, I really don\u2019t think she herself would introduce the two without letting me know.", "It\u2019s not even the words I\u2019m afraid of. It\u2019s the chance that he may get physical. I know it sounds ridiculous but my son is half Middle Eastern. I\u2019m scared. \n\nAnd yes, this situation makes it a lot clearer. They may pretend to care or understand, but many simply don\u2019t. No one else seems to have an issue with this man being at the wedding, not even my MIL who divorced him because of his anger issues and \u201cextreme\u201d values. If she couldn\u2019t take it, why should my son?", "This. NTA. \n\nI\u2019m not a POC at all. I\u2019m white as fuck, 31 female presenting. I would not go to a wedding that man was at. I don\u2019t handle things well and the second he got racist I\u2019d either hit him or flee, and both would ruin things for the bride. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t go myself, and I would NEVER take a small child.
