We have two kids, this conflict concerns our oldest (Jack-5yo). \n\nMy husband has a half sister (Ann-23yo) that he is not very close to. However, she gets along very well with Jack. She sometimes offers to take him on auntie-nephew dates which I allow as I do trust her. She\u2019s great with Jack and he adores her as well. \n\nAnn is getting married in a couple weeks. We were all invited, but my husband couldn\u2019t get time off work, and my mother will be visiting that weekend too so we won\u2019t be able to attend. Ann asked if we could at least let Jack attend and that she and my MIL will watch him. I was hesitant but Ann and my MIL told me not to worry about it. I agreed.\n\nThen Ann told me that her father will be attending the wedding. I was surprised because she hasn\u2019t had contact with him for years but they reconnected for her wedding. In my opinion, her father isn\u2019t a very good person. He\u2019s extremely racist and very headstrong about his beliefs. He is also easily convinced by certain kinds of media and before we even knew he was attending the wedding, my husband showed me his facebook posts and they were genuinely insane. Lots of generalizations about groups of people and justifying various horrors simply because of a person\u2019s skin tone or race.\n\nI told Ann that I don\u2019t know if my son will be attending anymore. She got what I meant and told me that her dad won\u2019t even be able to tell Jack isn\u2019t 100% white so I have nothing to worry about. I mean yes, my son is white passing, but with the current climate of things, I refuse to risk it. My son will sometimes speak my language and he is not 100% aware that he has to be careful around certain people yet.\n\nAnn got upset and told me that nothing will happen and I\u2019m being paranoid. She even compared my \u201cparanoia\u201d to her father\u2019s. She then told me to think about it rationally as the venue is a public place filled with people. \n\nI apologized and said I can\u2019t let him go. She started shouting at me and said I was ruining her wedding. She wants to spend it with everyone she loves, Jack included, and I\u2019m ruining that by being paranoid. She then started crying, I think, before hanging up. My MIL called me later saying that she swears nothing will happen to Jack and to please \u201cget over it\u201d for Ann\u2019s happiness. I said no. She told me that she hopes I\u2019m proud of myself for breaking Ann\u2019s heart. I do feel bad, and I suppose I am being paranoid. But AITA?

One time, after a Thanksgiving dinner, we were talking about my upcoming child's birth & whether or not I'd be breastfeeding.  I said yes, but I wanted to find a cover that I could use just in case there wasn't a private place to nurse.\n\nMy BiL (who isn't usually an AH) blurted out that I'd get used to breastfeeding in public pretty quickly if I would just do it.  I looked at him with my cold & now dead-looking eyes & said, \"Yea, if only I hadn't been attacked by a group of 5 guys, maybe I'd be a bit more relaxed about things,\" and walked out of the room.\n\nIt still makes me angry almost 20 yrs later. \n\nOP's choice to keep her son at home is her choice, not her SiL's. It's offensive that SiL has MiL telling OP that her heart is breaking because she won't allow her son to go to the wedding. SiL & MiL have no clue about the heartache that OP has gone through thinking about how her son might be treated just because of how he looks.", "This right here. I've had experiences where there were a bunch of people of different races telling a white person why something made them uncomfortable, and the whitenperson argued and doubled down, and was basically everything wrong with white people not listening. Then, when I (also white) step in, and basically repeat everything the other people were trying to tell them, all of the sudden, \"OH, I GET IT NOW\" which I can only imagine how infuriating that is for every other person who was not white trying to say the same thing, and get dismissed. I make it a point to tell the white person that hey, I didn't say anything that these other people haven't already told you, and you need to take a long look at yourself and think about why you chose to listen to ME and dismiss everything these other people have said, because your racism and privilege is showing. \n\nSometimes the other white person actually hears this and reflects on the issue, and they end up apologizing.   Other times, they decide I'm an asshole too. \n\nIt's the phenomenon where men tend to dismiss what women say, and accept it when a man says exactly the same thing to them.

Remember all the men who used to tell women they \"Didn't have a sense of humor\" or \"Shouldn't be so sensitive\" while they outrageously insulted them?

This isn\u2019t OPs moms job. \n\nAt this point, with your further elaboration, yeah, you are in fact saying POC should be fine dealing with more racism. This is an event with a racist OP can choose to not have her family attend. You are saying she should go, knowing she has a good chance of encountering racism, and be on the defense to\u2026 slay \ud83d\ude02\n\nOP should teach her kid how to defend himself against trash like this. POC should be ready to confront the bullshit when it comes there way.
