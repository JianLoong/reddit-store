On the face of it with no other information, this does seem unfair to Iris, but it's possible that there could be a good reason for it (like it being a good networking event for a career you want to get into, for example). The fact that you didn't mention any such reason either when you first brought up being invited to the event or later on when Iris' mother had caused a fuss about it, in a post where you would obviously want to present your side in the best light possible, strongly suggests to me that there *isn't* a good reason for it and it's just your grandfather playing favourites. The fact that he didn't stick to his guns and uninvited you supports that as well, because if there was a good reason then he wouldn't have had to do that.\n\nOn top of that, why are you angry at Iris for complaining about being treated unfairly? Your grandfather created this ENTIRE situation by first inviting only you and then deciding to uninvite you afterwards, yet you don't put any blame on him at all. Frankly I get the strong impression that you're already treated preferentially as a bit of a golden grandchild, and now you're mad at the first person to point that out and potentially \"threaten\" that position.\n\nESH - Granddad for creating the problem and you for taking it out on the wrong person.

No, there\u2019s no career reason he asked me, he just did. He does stuff like that sometimes, like just appear in town and take you places.

My friends all find her grating, and I often do as well, but I ignored all that because I thought, how sucky would it be to have to hang out with your parents and your little brother the whole time when you could be partying or boating etc with people your own age? And Iris knew that. So in return for several weeks of me inviting her out of courtesy maybe for one night she could have just got off the soap box? I understand she might feel slighted but she couldn\u2019t just reciprocate the consideration and not go complaining to her mother? One night, really? \n\nThis doesn\u2019t potentially threaten anything. This isn\u2019t Succession. I just wanted to dress up and go to a party with my grandpa that I got invited to, that\u2019s all.

Why didn't he have you two flip for it?", "Then NTA.\n\nI wanted to give Iris the benefit of the doubt that maybe she was just venting to Aunt and Aunt decided to make it into a whole thing.
