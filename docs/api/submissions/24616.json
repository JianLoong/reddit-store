On the face of it with no other information, this does seem unfair to Iris, but it's possible that there could be a good reason for it (like it being a good networking event for a career you want to get into, for example). The fact that you didn't mention any such reason either when you first brought up being invited to the event or later on when Iris' mother had caused a fuss about it, in a post where you would obviously want to present your side in the best light possible, strongly suggests to me that there *isn't* a good reason for it and it's just your grandfather playing favourites. The fact that he didn't stick to his guns and uninvited you supports that as well, because if there was a good reason then he wouldn't have had to do that.\n\nOn top of that, why are you angry at Iris for complaining about being treated unfairly? Your grandfather created this ENTIRE situation by first inviting only you and then deciding to uninvite you afterwards, yet you don't put any blame on him at all.

My friends all find her grating, and I often do as well, but I ignored all that because I thought, how sucky would it be to have to hang out with your parents and your little brother the whole time when you could be partying or boating etc with people your own age?

Have Iris and her family long felt like you are favored and get things that she doesn\u2019t?

You don\u2019t seem to feel bad for her in the slightest, only annoyed with her\n\nYou seem to be aware that you are the golden child in your family, but you are totally good with that, haven\u2019t once acknowledged that maybe your grandpa shouldn\u2019t have left one of you out.

Without knowing more about what was said between her and her mother, I can't blame her for the issue growing to involve the whole family. It's totally reasonable for her to complain to her mother about being alone for an evening bc of the event, and for all we know that could have set the mother off. I just need to know more", "We have no idea how her friends view her cousin.

I\u2019m just lucky to have friends here so my view is the majority here, if I were in her town hanging out with her friends, I\u2019d be the cousin that none of them like.

Yes, grandpa did buy me a pony, but Iris doesn\u2019t even ride horses, and he refused to give her parents the equivalent amount in cash so there was drama. \n\nPersonally, what I would have done, is not said anything. I\u2019d have told my mum and it would have gone no further.

Yes, I centred my own emotions, as Iris centred hers, which is *human* and totally fine, but we don\u2019t operate in isolation, what you do affects how people interact with you, and if you can\u2019t perceive the consequences well\u2026you should. \n\nThe same way I don\u2019t have any control over Iris and how she handles things, I have even less control over my grandfather.

You're suggesting OP should have declined so he could bring Iris, but not that Iris should have declined so he could bring OP?", "OP has clearly stated, multiple times, that she doesn't know why her grandfather chose her.  She speculated and you latched onto that as if it was a definitive answer as to why he chose OP.  It was a choice that the grandfather made, period.  He has the right to make that choice.

OP was there so he turned to her and asked OP. He probably put no more thought into it, just OP who is standing there, might be interested, I'll ask her. I bet if Iris was in the room and OP wasn't, he would have asked her.

Why should OP, because she is nice, have to cater to Iris, who sounds like a brat?\n\nHere's some advice for you. All people are equal, but will be treated differently by others depending on their personalitity and relationship. If you are nice to someone, they will treat you better than they would someone who is rude to you. Thats how life works. \n\nIf OP gets asked out on a date by a local boy, but Iris doesn't, does that OP doesn't get to go? Iris is just as worthy of being asked out but did not.

The problem is Op didn\u2019t even bother to try and find out. Grandpa is clearly playing favorites, and you can\u2019t comprehend why the one not chosen wouldn\u2019t feel jealous and left out?
