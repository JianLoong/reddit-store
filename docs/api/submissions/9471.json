Well last night I was super exhausted and decided that I didn't feel like cooking. I was really craving sushi from a nearby restaurant and wanted to get some delivered.

My food got delivered right as my dad finished cooking, so I sat down and ate with them. My nephew suddenly decided he HATES burgers, but loves sushi (he had tried sushi before and absolutely hated it, he just liked the idea of it). He threw an absolute fit and yelled and cried because he wanted my food. My dad and step mom both just said to give my food to him and I could have his burger. I got really frustrated and said that I had cooked every night this week and just wanted a break for one night to enjoy someone else's food, and they said that I could enjoy someone else's food, as in the burger. I reminded them that I don't like burgers and they said I needed to grow up and stop being a baby and just eat it. My nephew ate one bite of sushi and spat it out on top of the rest of the role. I just ate chips for dinner. I got very frustrated and went to my room, crying out of frustration.\n\nMy dad came into my room and said if anyone should be mad it's him because he cooked the burgers and bought the sushi, even though I was planning on buying the sushi myself.

Sounds like you should be using that time to study, not cook for people who obviously don't appreciate it even a little.", "NTA. \n\nYour dad dropped the ball here. He said you could have the sushi. When your nephew came to stay, he had a tantrum. Instead of doing something about the situation, your dad takes your food and gives it to him. Your dad has shown you that he isn\u2019t going to set rules and stick by them. He\u2019d rather take the easy way out, getting mad when you don\u2019t like his behavior.

When a kid is throwing a fit, you send them to bed without dinner, you don't give them what they want.  \n\nWhat you Dad is essentially telling you here is that if you throw the bigger fit, you'll get the food you want and everyone else will get blamed for not acquiescing to you.", "NTA OP. \n\nAnd please for the love of fastfood & everything cheesy... \n\nStop cooking for your family!!!!  \n\nYou're a child... It's not your job to provide for the ADULTS of the family!!", "Nope nope nope.\n\nThat poor child is going to grow up with no self-regulation skills. No one outside your home would put up with that behavior. He's 8, not 2.\n\nAnd you are entirely right and justified in the way you said it's affecting you.\n\nHe *spat out the food on your plate* and they didn't do anything?!\n\nYour parents are being AHs. And really bad at parenting in general.\n\nYou are NTA", "NTA. They shouldn\u2019t be catering to wishes of an 8yo child just because he throws a fit. It also makes no sense to tell someone to grow up when it comes to taste. If you don\u2019t like a certain food then it is what it is. Your taste might change when you get older but it\u2019s not going to change in a day. You\u2019re father and nephew are TA.", "NTA\n\nCapitulating to tantrums is not proper or appropriate.", "NTA\n\nWhy are you, the child, cooking every night? Your dad and stepmom can be the adults for once", "NTA-\n\nThis is messed up to be honest. Sounds like the nephew is the brat. And obviously they are allowing these tantrums which is probably adding to Nephews' eating issues. Hope they start parenting well soon, otherwise they are going to create a real problem.", "NTA. Parentification is a type of child abuse. Stop cooking and start telling your teachers and greater family members what is going on.", "NTA, in my opinion, your dad dropped the ball, unfortunately.", "NTA but your Dad and Step Mom definitely are.

NTA.", "NTA and your dad just taught nephew that pitching a fit will get him what he wants.\n\nI recommend not cooking for them anymore", ">He said I was being childish and a spoiled brat\n\nThis is so ironic because that's exactly what your parents/siblings are raising your nephew to be. It's completely normal for young children to throw tantrums sometimes when they don't get their own way (though 8 is kinda old for that). What isn't normal and healthy is for adults to give in instead of teaching them that life doesn't always go their own way. You shouldn't have had to give up your sushi, regardless of who paid for it. You also shouldn't have to cook dinner for your entire family every single night at age 16. It sounds like there might be some parentification going on. You're definitely NTA.", "Absolutely NTA! I have an 8yo who knows better than to throw tantrums because that shit doesn't work. Your nephew has been taught that his tantrums *do* work because he's obviously been given whatever he wants every single time. At his age he should be asking \"can I try some of that please?\" and be able to accept whatever the answer is, not demanding your whole meal. You are not the spoiled brat in this story, by any stretch of the imagination!", "NTA.\nI suggest you stop cooking for them, full stop. If you make something for yourself, make only enough for yourself and do not give in to any requests otherwise. You're childish? YOU ARE A CHILD. Children are not responsible for cooking dinners for the entire family multiple nights a week.\n\nRemove yourself from this story and put in your step-mother instead. Ask your Dad this - If your step-mother had spent all week cooking before finally getting a treat to herself, would she have been asked to give that up? Would she have been allowed to be upset when the meal she really wanted was then regurgitated and wasted?\n\nOh, that's different because she's an adult and you just need to be thankful for what you're given?\n\nEither you are adult enough to support your family with cooking and get to have some autonomy as a benefit, or you don't have any say and you shouldn't be doing adult responsibilities.", "Stop cooking for your family. And if that is part of your chores, then only cook burgers. They don't deserve your home cooking. \nNta.", "NTA. Your family sounds awful.

What do your parents teach him?! He is old enough to understand he can't have everything he pointed at. Your parents are AHs.
