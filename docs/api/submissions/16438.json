When it comes to Margot and Alex, they're both atheists. It does not affect our relationship at all and we all love each other.\n\nHowever, my son has been making comments very similar to what Alex would say about most things. Alex is a surgeon and my son looks up to her a lot. Which is why he is very easily influenced by her views. He would say all these things and try to change our minds at the table.\n\nSo I called Alex and told her that my son was being influenced by her. I asked her to give him a bit of space so he could find out what he thinks on his own. She said more information would only do him good and that he was a smart boy and would be a delightful man when he growns up no matter what he believes. \n\nI asked her to please not talk to him about these things. She got mad and said I was being controlling and as long as my son was allowed to come over, she would let him choose the topic of their discussions.\n\nBoth Margot and Alex are acting cold towards me.

When it comes to Margot and Alex, they're both atheists. It does not affect our relationship at all and we all love each other.\n\nHowever, my son has been making comments very similar to what Alex would say about most things. Alex is a surgeon and my son looks up to her a lot. Which is why he is very easily influenced by her views. He would say all these things and try to change our minds at the table.\n\nSo I called Alex and told her that my son was being influenced by her. I asked her to give him a bit of space so he could find out what he thinks on his own. She said more information would only do him good and that he was a smart boy and would be a delightful man when he growns up no matter what he believes. \n\nI asked her to please not talk to him about these things. She got mad and said I was being controlling and as long as my son was allowed to come over, she would let him choose the topic of their discussions.\n\nBoth Margot and Alex are acting cold towards me.

YTA, OP (if this is even a real post, it's such a clich\u00e9). This is a story as old as time - in a variety of different religions, cultures, etc. \nCertain parents think their children are being 'unduly influenced', 'brainwashed', etc. Yet all that has happened, is their children have heard different viewpoints in a diverse society - and want to explore them. That is a perfectly appropriate developmental phase of healthy adolescence, and should be encouraged. \n\nHowever, because they are different to YOUR opinions, YOU feel threatened. So the eternal irony, is YOU are the one doing what you fear from others (brainwashing your child). The ONLY one trying to restrict his exposure to different viewpoints, is YOU - nobody else. \nNo parent genuinely interested in giving their children freedom of thought, feels anxious in this way. \n\nAll Alex is doing, is expressing her own opinions - everyone in society has their own opinions, and the right to express them. That's very different from influencing him 'unduly'. Has it occurred to you he might look up to her, BECAUSE she has similar opinions to his own? Some kids admire sports stars, some admire scientists, some admire religious figures, etc. Who they admire, tends to reflect what the ADOLESCENT really believes (as an individual, with their OWN mind). \n\nHe might ultimately decide her opinions make sense to him - or he might not. Or he might decide they make sense now, and change his mind later. It doesn't matter. It is HIS decision to make, what he ultimately believes. You can't force him to share your beliefs, by starving him of different ideas. He will only genuinely believe what you believe one day, if it comes naturally to him as an individual - that if after considering other beliefs, he then CHOSES HIMSELF to believe what you do.\n\nNeither you nor anyone else should be limiting his exposure to different opinions. He'll hear a wide variety, from a multitude of people - no matter how much you try to limit his exposure, to viewpoints that only align with YOUR opinions. \nAnd indeed, Alex is NOT trying to limit his exposure, as you are doing to him. She's just letting him chat, and giving her own opinion. \n\nThis is what is supposed to happen in adolescence, on their route to forming their OWN eventual adult opinions. The only one trying to limit the views he hears, is YOU.  Ask yourself seriously - if you were genuinely interested in letting him form HIS own opinions, why would you do that?  The answer is you DON'T want him to form any opinions, that stray from your own beliefs. But you'll find you only isolate him from your beliefs instead, if you don't allow him to explore different ideas.", "Religious indoctrination is the worst.
