Alex is a surgeon and my son looks up to her a lot. Which is why he is very easily influenced by her views. He would say all these things and try to change our minds at the table.\n\nSo I called Alex and told her that my son was being influenced by her. I asked her to give him a bit of space so he could find out what he thinks on his own. She said more information would only do him good and that he was a smart boy and would be a delightful man when he growns up no matter what he believes. \n\nI asked her to please not talk to him about these things. She got mad and said I was being controlling and as long as my son was allowed to come over, she would let him choose the topic of their discussions.\n\nBoth Margot and Alex are acting cold towards me.

YTA, OP (if this is even a real post, it's such a clich\u00e9). This is a story as old as time - in a variety of different religions, cultures, etc. \nCertain parents think their children are being 'unduly influenced', 'brainwashed', etc. Yet all that has happened, is their children have heard different viewpoints in a diverse society - and want to explore them. That is a perfectly appropriate developmental phase of healthy adolescence, and should be encouraged. \n\nHowever, because they are different to YOUR opinions, YOU feel threatened. So the eternal irony, is YOU are the one doing what you fear from others (brainwashing your child). The ONLY one trying to restrict his exposure to different viewpoints, is YOU - nobody else. \nNo parent genuinely interested in giving their children freedom of thought, feels anxious in this way. \n\nAll Alex is doing, is expressing her own opinions - everyone in society has their own opinions, and the right to express them. That's very different from influencing him 'unduly'. Has it occurred to you he might look up to her, BECAUSE she has similar opinions to his own? Some kids admire sports stars, some admire scientists, some admire religious figures, etc. Who they admire, tends to reflect what the ADOLESCENT really believes (as an individual, with their OWN mind). \n\nHe might ultimately decide her opinions make sense to him - or he might not. Or he might decide they make sense now, and change his mind later. It doesn't matter. There isn't some strange, random moment in adolescence, when whatever random idea they are hearing at that second, becomes indelibly tattooed as their opinion forever. It is HIS decision to make, what he ultimately believes - and he will believe what ultimately makes most sense to him, all things considered. You can't force him to share your beliefs, by starving him of different ideas. \n\nHe will only genuinely believe what you believe one day, if it comes naturally to him as an individual. That if after considering other beliefs, he then CHOSES HIMSELF to believe what you do. Neither you nor anyone else should be limiting his exposure to different opinions. He'll hear a wide variety, from a multitude of people - no matter how much you try to limit his exposure, to viewpoints that only align with YOUR opinions. And indeed, Alex is NOT trying to limit his exposure, as you are doing to him. She's just letting him chat, and giving her own opinion. \n\nThis is what is supposed to happen in adolescence, on their route to forming their OWN eventual adult opinions. The only one trying to limit the views he hears, is YOU.  Ask yourself seriously - if you were genuinely interested in letting him form HIS own opinions, why would you do that?  The answer is you DON'T want him to form any opinions, that stray from your own beliefs.

We are not raising our daughter to be religious. When she is older, we will talk about ALL religions. For now, though, we raise her to respect other people\u2019s beliefs, but we aren\u2019t instilling them in her. \n\nBoth sides of the family are Christian and some of the relatives are really conservative. We have a policy of not discussing religion, no religious gifts, etc. Several relatives were MAD about this at first. We don\u2019t care that it makes them mad. They are entitled t their beliefs and religious practices, but they are not entitled to discuss it with my small child. They all know if they violate this, they won\u2019t get to see our kid without us being present (no cousin sleepovers; no grandparent sleepovers; etc.). They don\u2019t like it, but they respect it. \n\nSo this is why I say NTA - you are entitled to raise your kids how you see fit. \n\nHOWEVER: if they are not discussing fundamental religious tenants, or telling your kid their religious beliefs are wrong, this gets muddy. Based on your post, I\u2019m assuming that is what they are doing, but also knowing a lot of conservative Christians and being raised as one, I also know that facts and beliefs are often conflated.

This will get harder as your kids get older. You cannot control everything they believe anymore, or even everyone they talk to... And to TRY  to will push your son away from your beliefs. You are his parent, and you are allowed to draw lines, but you need to be discerning as your kids begin to reach out to sources other than you for wisdom. \n\nBe kind, be open, but you don't have to soft-peddle what you believe -- just know that the age of accountability (in regards to choice of Christian salvation or not) is coming upon your kids.

Christians can be weird.", "Just sounds like xenophobia and racism to me", "My mom's friend is one of the believers and she got into a heated discussion with my dad one night. My dad tried to tell her that even going by the creation thoughts, God's 7 days weren't actual 24 hour days, so anything could have happened, so God and dinosaurs could exist together. She would have none of it. Dinosaurs didn't exist and God created the Earth in 144 hours.\n\nFor years after, whenever my dad saw her he'd say \"what about the dinosaurs, Deb?\" and smirk", "Legit was told that by some people when I was in high school. These people also had a hard time explaining Egyptian pyramids and how there were other humans outside of the Garden of Eden.", "Ooo, that was my family!", "Well, then I can confirm this for you! I play a mobile game with a guy who claims the dinosaurs were on the ark.

Maybe you should try reading their comment slowly this time?", "Vegetarianism =\\= Hinduism. You can be vegetarian and not practice Hinduism.", "I'm agnostic now but when I was a Christian, I once bought and read some of an interesting book where three theologians present their differing points of views on the Creation story. I didn't finish reading it because it was too much for my poor brain.\n\nAt least one of the theologians agreed with your dad about how a day wasn't necessarily a 24 hour period and could be a long stretch of time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore broadly speaking, there are at least two views on the Bible by Christians: \"the Bible is inerrant\" and \"the Bible is infallible\". \n\nThe \"inerrant\" believers think ALL of it is literally true ie that there was literally a Garden of Eden, serpent, Adam and Eve.\n\nThe \"infallible\" believers think that it's not all literally true but the meaning behind the stores is absolutely true eg there wasn't an Adam and Eve but humans were created by God but got corrupted and things went bad.

It seems your time would be better spent in prayer, reading your fairy-tale Bible, or hosting a bible study on Wednesday nights. Maybe you could all talk about how badly people like me need Jesus and how, right this very second, you are being persecuted for being a Christian.", "I am also part of the second group. I was raised Catholic and I still believe in God. I married a Lutheran whose family is very religious and so I told him if he wants to raise our kids. That way he's taking him to church and doing all that. However, I want to make sure that they know that the Bible is not fact. I won't get into how many times.
