She works within the company and has access to flight records and personal information. My wife and I were hanging out with Nancy a couple weeks ago and she kept causally bragging about how she had been searching up celebrities and had found out emails, phone numbers, multiple addresses and other person details. Nancy claims to have found information on over 20+ celebrities, including some huge names. My wife and I both mentioned that it probably wasn\u2019t a good idea, and if she got caught she\u2019d likely be in some big trouble. \n\nA few days after, I was hanging out with another friend (let\u2019s call him Tony, 27) who also works for the same airline company but in a different sector. I had mentioned what Nancy had been doing, and he agreed that it was a bad idea and she would end up in pretty serious trouble for looking up such information. \n\nThis Friday, I received an angry phone call from Nancy, who was yelling about how I had told her boss what she was doing and she had been fired for looking up personal celebrity information. I explained that I had mentioned it to another friend but didn\u2019t think he would tell anyone. It turns out Tony had mentioned it to his girlfriend, who ended up telling her bestfriend who works above Nancy in the company. This lead to Nancy\u2019s boss finding out, and consequently firing her. Tony\u2019s girlfriend found out that Nancy had searched over 100 celebrities, and had access information including family contact info and address. \n\nMy wife is split and says I shouldn\u2019t have spoken about it, but also agrees that what Nancy was doing was pretty creepy and this was a consequence of her bragging. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1684207788, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13itqhd/aita_for_getting_my_wifes_friend_fired_from_her/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She fucked around and found out.", "NTA. Whether you exposed her deliberately or by accident what she was doing was unethical, against company policy and perhaps an invasion of privacy.  \n\nIf she blabs about it then that's exactly the way rumors start and she should have expected that to happen.", "NTA and good job, you exposed a glorified stalker. Even though you didn't do it intentionally, N either knew or should have known the consequences of talking about something like that, and she's choosing to take it out on you instead of holding herself accountable. She's lucky the airline didn't get sued, and if she wrote down or otherwise kept any of the contact information somehow, she's heading for an eventual lawsuit herself.", "NTA if she was running her mouth about it she had it coming.", "NTA. A, you don\u2019t control what T does with info that N was bragging about, and B, that\u2019s just outright creepy of her to be doing.", "NTA Nobody wants their personal information with someone who's going to abuse it and invade their privacy. Just because they're celebrities doesn't give anyone the right to access their personal information. Would you appreciate it if it was you? Although you didn't mean for it to happen, the right thing was done.", "NTA that's an invasion of privacy and abuse of power & access to information. If you don't wanna get fired, maybe don't do it. \n\nPlus you didn't even tell her boss directly, if she's telling other people this info, why can't you?", "Ur friend a creep so nta", "NTA\n\nwhat she was doing might even be illegal in some way.

N could have done a lot of bad stuff with that info, example: sending a fan their address for a quick buck and that could but them in more trouble than simply getting fired", "NTA, she wasn't hiding it so why should you hide it for her?", "NTA - you didn\u2019t get her fired, she got *herself* fired. I feel like that is an important thing to point out. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not the only one she bragged about to and it would\u2019ve gotten back to her boss eventually. Unprofessional and a breach of privacy, not cool.", "NTA\n\nShe was being a weird creep and bragging about it, she got herself fired. If she'd simply kept her mouth shut then no-one would be the wiser.\n\nI hope the airline has reached out to all those celebrities to inform them a rogue member of staff has accessed all their personal information from company files...", "YTA for ratting her out and expecting her not to find out about it. But this is her own fault. What she did goes against her code of conduct and rules for people working in airlines and she definitely needed to be fired.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There were like 6 other stores in our area.\n\nMy last couple years I was a PIC. Basically I was the person of authority for the entire store when all the managers left for the day. There was just two PIC\u2019s for the store. The other PIC was a dope and generally made stupid decisions.\n\nBoth of us had computer logins but honestly there was no reason for us to use them. I had a login for order writing but I was one of a few people (not him) who used it. Our logins allowed us to look up customer info, including all of their transactions. Our company had you submit a phone number that is what you used to get sale prices. We had staff cards as well that gave us the same things.\n\nSo the other PIC was just casually browsing people\u2019s purchase history. He was even going through staff histories as well. The even more stupid part is that he told a couple checkers as well what he was doing and telling them other staff info. I only found out because one of our younger checkers causally told me. I told my immediate supervisor, and he was pissed and he had me talk with our store manager, who was also pissed, but ultimately nothing happened. He did other shit that should have got him fired but lucked out there too.", "The irony indeed!\n\nNTA OP", "In uk and Europe she would if the authorities decided to pursue it earn the company a GDPR fine for mismanagement of personal data.

She needs to blame herself", "She is the one who started the line of communication that ended with her boss.  She ratted on herself. If sharing what she did makes anyone an asshole, it\u2019s her. Add that to the fact that she did the searches knowing it was a fireable offense, and the case for her being the asshole is even stronger. \n\nHow did she think this was going to end?", "But do you track the cats by VIN number \ud83e\udd2d"]}
