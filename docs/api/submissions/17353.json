She works within the company and has access to flight records and personal information. My wife and I were hanging out with Nancy a couple weeks ago and she kept causally bragging about how she had been searching up celebrities and had found out emails, phone numbers, multiple addresses and other person details. Nancy claims to have found information on over 20+ celebrities, including some huge names. My wife and I both mentioned that it probably wasn\u2019t a good idea, and if she got caught she\u2019d likely be in some big trouble. \n\nA few days after, I was hanging out with another friend (let\u2019s call him Tony, 27) who also works for the same airline company but in a different sector. I had mentioned what Nancy had been doing, and he agreed that it was a bad idea and she would end up in pretty serious trouble for looking up such information. \n\nThis Friday, I received an angry phone call from Nancy, who was yelling about how I had told her boss what she was doing and she had been fired for looking up personal celebrity information. I explained that I had mentioned it to another friend but didn\u2019t think he would tell anyone. It turns out Tony had mentioned it to his girlfriend, who ended up telling her bestfriend who works above Nancy in the company. This lead to Nancy\u2019s boss finding out, and consequently firing her. Tony\u2019s girlfriend found out that Nancy had searched over 100 celebrities, and had access information including family contact info and address. \n\nMy wife is split and says I shouldn\u2019t have spoken about it, but also agrees that what Nancy was doing was pretty creepy and this was a consequence of her bragging. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1684207788, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13itqhd/aita_for_getting_my_wifes_friend_fired_from_her/", "score": 279, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even though you didn't do it intentionally, N either knew or should have known the consequences of talking about something like that, and she's choosing to take it out on you instead of holding herself accountable. She's lucky the airline didn't get sued, and if she wrote down or otherwise kept any of the contact information somehow, she's heading for an eventual lawsuit herself.", "NTA if she was running her mouth about it she had it coming.", "NTA.

Just because they're celebrities doesn't give anyone the right to access their personal information. Would you appreciate it if it was you? Although you didn't mean for it to happen, the right thing was done.", "NTA that's an invasion of privacy and abuse of power & access to information.

I feel like that is an important thing to point out. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not the only one she bragged about to and it would\u2019ve gotten back to her boss eventually.

There were like 6 other stores in our area.\n\nMy last couple years I was a PIC. Basically I was the person of authority for the entire store when all the managers left for the day. There was just two PIC\u2019s for the store. The other PIC was a dope and generally made stupid decisions.\n\nBoth of us had computer logins but honestly there was no reason for us to use them. I had a login for order writing but I was one of a few people (not him) who used it. Our logins allowed us to look up customer info, including all of their transactions. Our company had you submit a phone number that is what you used to get sale prices. We had staff cards as well that gave us the same things.\n\nSo the other PIC was just casually browsing people\u2019s purchase history. He was even going through staff histories as well. The even more stupid part is that he told a couple checkers as well what he was doing and telling them other staff info. I only found out because one of our younger checkers causally told me. I told my immediate supervisor, and he was pissed and he had me talk with our store manager, who was also pissed, but ultimately nothing happened. He did other shit that should have got him fired but lucked out there too.", "The irony indeed!\n\nNTA OP", "In uk and Europe she would if the authorities decided to pursue it earn the company a GDPR fine for mismanagement of personal data.

She needs to blame herself", "She is the one who started the line of communication that ended with her boss.  She ratted on herself. If sharing what she did makes anyone an asshole, it\u2019s her.

I worked for a major airline in a role with similar such access, and this kind of behavior was *explicitly* mentioned in the training as grounds for immediate termination, and potential legal action depending on what exactly you'd done. They know people will be tempted to do this, so there is no chance that Nancy hadn't been warned what would happen if she got caught doing this, and she would have eventually been caught regardless of what you said. Extra stupid, too, since my trainer mentioned that most of the contact info and addresses on celebrity accounts aren't their personal info, but rather that of an assistant or agent who handles their travel and is tasked with keeping that sort of info private.", "NTA", "NTA. Nancy, welcome to the land of Find Out.", "Nancy was the dummy for telling you.  NTA.", "NTA and oooooh Nancy.\n\nGirl, you better be glad they only fired you.

Even our Admin impersonation mode still logs the Admin's name for the actions they do while looking at the system through a user's eyes.

I recently took a job where we're not meant to be looking up people without a good reason, and I would definitely be fired if I did.

That sort of thing can get companies into serious trouble, at least in Europe.\n\nIf they monitored access she'd have been just as fired.\n\nPlus the reputational damage to the company if their employee is casually boasting that she can access all kinds of information she's not supposed to, plus the possibility of bribes for passing the information on. Total nightmare.", ">  If she'd simply kept her mouth shut then no-one would be the wiser\n\nIt probably would have taken longer if she kept her mouth shut, but she was still going to get caught eventually. \n\nThose kind of searches get logged in the system, and IT would have been able to trace it back to her pretty easily. \n\nIt was always a matter of \u201cwhen\u201d not \u201cif\u201d.", "> If they monitored access she'd have been just as fired.\n\n\nShe wouldn\u2019t have been fired if access wasn\u2019t monitored in someway. \n\nThey probably just don\u2019t check that sort of thing unless there is a problem or complaint. \n\nYou don\u2019t just get fired because a friend of a friend said they heard you did something.", "I mean regular monitoring, sweeps. Obviously they'd have to check a specific allegation. They may do random checks too."]}
