I had mentioned what Nancy had been doing, and he agreed that it was a bad idea and she would end up in pretty serious trouble for looking up such information. \n\nThis Friday, I received an angry phone call from Nancy, who was yelling about how I had told her boss what she was doing and she had been fired for looking up personal celebrity information. I explained that I had mentioned it to another friend but didn\u2019t think he would tell anyone. It turns out Tony had mentioned it to his girlfriend, who ended up telling her bestfriend who works above Nancy in the company. This lead to Nancy\u2019s boss finding out, and consequently firing her.
