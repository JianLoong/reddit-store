She texted me calling me a massive asshole for not buying new bulbs and \"installing\" (screwing them in) after I had taken mine out.\n\nShe really expected me to stop packing up my entire life and help her out after she ripped my heart out (via text. while I was six hours away at the wedding of a family friend. with no conversation or context or reason beyond \"it's not working anymore and I decided yesterday when I was with my friend\")\n\nSome people are just so self-centered that they cannot fathom others not dropping everything for them whenever they decide they want something.\n\nDEFINITELY NTA", "You should've said if you're too incompetent for her your to incompetent for moving her tv for her", "Hmmm, let me insult my BF, shred his abilities, break up with him, insult his packing while watching over his shoulder as he removes his belongings (most sensible people make ourselves scarce when there's moving out going on - or pack ex's things)....\nThen ask for a favor?\nHuh.
