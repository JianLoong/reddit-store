{"id": 4044, "submission_id": "zdf182", "title": "AITA for being creeped out that my husband wrote a gay story?", "selftext": "I'm 38F, my husband is 40M. We've been married for just under 9 years, and we have one daughter and one son (both 3). My husband has always been a business-minded individual- accounting degree, MBA, et cetera. His only quirk is that he greatly enjoys art- painting, drawing, acting, and writing. I've seen him act and I've read his stories before and I don't have any issue with them even though in all honesty I don't really see the point- it feels like a waste to me. But he enjoys it, and I'm not going to detract from that. A few months ago over dinner, he was talking excitedly about a new idea for a story he was thinking of writing based on a coworker of his. This coworker, J, is also very much into art and apparently the two of them came up with the idea for this new story together. I can't remember the exact details but the pertinent part is that the main character would be in a homosexual relationship, since J is gay. For some reason this didn't sit right with me, especially as my husband is (obviously) straight. I said why don't you write it about a man in a straight relationship and my husband said essentially that it's based partially on J's life and J isn't straight. It still doesn't sit right with me but I hoped my husband would grow bored of the idea and move on to something else, no harm no foul.\n\nWell, fast forward to this week when I was borrowing my husband's laptop and saw a word file with the name Something\\_Something\\_Story\\_Draft (changed obviously). Out of curiosity I clicked on it and scanned through it, and sure enough my husband has written a good forty or fifty pages so far, including dates and dancing and kissing all between this fictional character and his boyfriend. I was honestly grossed out that my husband was writing about something like that and shut his laptop and confronted him about it when he got home. He made a big deal about how I used his laptop without permission (deflecting from the real issue) and why it bothered me so much that the main character was gay. His argument was that he's written stories from womens' perspectives before and he's directed plays that involve gay people and so this isn't any different. The argument hasn't really ended since but my husband has basically said that he's writing the book because he wants to, if I have a problem with it then it's my problem and he doesn't have to talk to me about it or show me it. I don't know, I still feel grossed out by it.

We've been married for just under 9 years, and we have one daughter and one son (both 3). My husband has always been a business-minded individual- accounting degree, MBA, et cetera. His only quirk is that he greatly enjoys art- painting, drawing, acting, and writing. I've seen him act and I've read his stories before and I don't have any issue with them even though in all honesty I don't really see the point- it feels like a waste to me. But he enjoys it, and I'm not going to detract from that. A few months ago over dinner, he was talking excitedly about a new idea for a story he was thinking of writing based on a coworker of his. This coworker, J, is also very much into art and apparently the two of them came up with the idea for this new story together. I can't remember the exact details but the pertinent part is that the main character would be in a homosexual relationship, since J is gay. For some reason this didn't sit right with me, especially as my husband is (obviously) straight. I said why don't you write it about a man in a straight relationship and my husband said essentially that it's based partially on J's life and J isn't straight. It still doesn't sit right with me but I hoped my husband would grow bored of the idea and move on to something else, no harm no foul.\n\nWell, fast forward to this week when I was borrowing my husband's laptop and saw a word file with the name Something\\_Something\\_Story\\_Draft (changed obviously). Out of curiosity I clicked on it and scanned through it, and sure enough my husband has written a good forty or fifty pages so far, including dates and dancing and kissing all between this fictional character and his boyfriend. I was honestly grossed out that my husband was writing about something like that and shut his laptop and confronted him about it when he got home. He made a big deal about how I used his laptop without permission (deflecting from the real issue) and why it bothered me so much that the main character was gay. His argument was that he's written stories from womens' perspectives before and he's directed plays that involve gay people and so this isn't any different. The argument hasn't really ended since but my husband has basically said that he's writing the book because he wants to, if I have a problem with it then it's my problem and he doesn't have to talk to me about it or show me it. I don't know, I still feel grossed out by it. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

OP is homophobic.\n\nI bet she's listened to and danced to songs by gay people and about gay people! Maybe that made her gay, OMG! The Horror! \n\nYou're homophobic, OP. You need to work through these issues. I wouldn't be surprised if your husband leaves you over your homophobia and lack of respect for his passions. \n\nYTA", ">evidence right here \"I was honestly grossed out that my husband was writing about something like that\"\n\nIs she grossed out by the material, or is she scared that her husband is secretly in the closet?", "Nope, people like op exists, I deal with one every single day at work.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking too", "Yeah that really irritated me.  Like it's some strange behavior that she just barely tolerates.", "This", "Is that a hilarious typo, or a weird stereotype that I've never come across before? ( I'm guessing swype, since f & g and t & y are next to each other?)", "\"I was honestly grossed out that my husband was writing about something like that\"\n\nI originally thought it was homophobia, but I reread it and now I am just wondering if she suspects her husband is in the closet.", "I've read that last one, it was about Horace Mann, he was fairly stable after the procedure, least that's what I herd.", "Right? Honestly, i wonder if she secretly worries that he wants a sex change every time he writes a story from a woman's perspective.", "And vice versa.", "You better tell that to all the famous, married romance novelists out there. Just saying. I hope you're not married because boy your take is rancid and toxic to any relationship.", ">Your husband, however, is engaged in homoerotic sexual roleplay with his coworker. That's NOT acceptable and is emotional infidelity, by basically sexting with them through other media.\n\n...................You cannot honestly be conflating the husband writing a fictional story inspired by his gay coworker for them having a sexual relationship.\n\nOP is going to read this and be even more secure in her homophobia.", "How is that\u2019s infidelity? They\u2019re writing a story. He\u2019s not confiding in him. And on top of it, the story is fictional. Whether it\u2019s based off a real person, it\u2019s  still a fictional story. I feel like this is a stretch.", ">Your husband, however, is engaged in homoerotic sexual roleplay with his coworker.\n\nWhat? Where? When? How? How did you get there?!", "Yikes with this whole response.\nThat's not how role-playing works, that's not cheating.\nThat fact that you question his sexuality for a fictional story says a lot.", "Homoerotic where?? \"Dates and dancing and kissing\" are a standard part of any book about a person who has human relationships. The list didn\u2019t even include anything sexual and you *know* OP would have mentioned if something like that were in the book. If he were writing about a man dating and dancing with a woman would you think it was erotic or is it just sexual because it\u2019s two men? Watching Footloose must have been so awkward for you as a child, so much dancing.", "....because straight people can't write gay stories? where are you getting that he's in the closet from? OP doesn't suggest they don't have a sex life, her husband doesn't hide his stories- in fact he tells her about them (which may be a bad idea if she's his beard *and* a homophobe to boot)\n\n*it didn't sit right with you because you've got a little issue with homophobia too*. Just an FYI in case you missed it...", "It seems like you just wanted to shoehorn in a closet joke because it makes no sense to think he's gay because he's writing a story about someone he personally knows who happens to be gay. If I write a story about a man when I'm actually a woman does that make me trans? Is this how I finally become a mermaid?\n\nPeople write characters that aren't like them all the time. It's abjectly bizarre to assume someone is gay if they don't exclude every sexuality but hetero from their writing.", "I cannot imagine what a miserable life OP must lead with this type of thinking", "Yeah this commenter is clearly only LGBT+ because they once wrote about a LGBT+ couple \n\n/s", " I\u2019m glad the likelihood of me, running into these people in real life is slim. I would do that Op all day.    \u201cGeorge Orwell was multiple farm animals that could talk.\u201d", "I believe they exist because they do. I think they frame their arguments based on on situations. Like how narcissistic parents always say \"I don't know why my kids hate me\" or \"they won't tell me\". They know why because they've been told but it doesn't help their narrative. OP doesn't even state why it's gross. The post feels fake not the situation specifically.", "You are 100 correct. It was a swype typo. \ud83d\ude02", "Relevant joke: What's a gay horse's favorite food?\n\nHAAAAYYYYYYYYYY!", "OP said the husband and coworker came up with the idea together.", "Some just think it's natural. This person I deal with never relates his homophobia with something else, he just spits nonsense because thats how he thinks.", "Some people are actually that delusional. They hear the reason and literally can\u2019t acknowledge it, because it would mean admitting that they fucked up. Check out the \u201cMissing Missing Reasons\u201d article about estranged parents forums. The things people will do to avoid admitting that they did a bad thing. To even themselves. It\u2019s amazing.", "That's still not roleplaying ma dude.", "That doesn't mean they're writing smut.", "Yes that's what I mean. They will manipulate a story to get people on their side."]}
