I know we shouldn\u2019t jump to conclusions but\u2026 I can\u2019t imagine this is the only issue OP belittles her for. Hopefully I\u2019m wrong", "Of course she's not helping but there's no reason for the rudeness and I posted my point in the previous comments", "I'm sure he's very well acquainted with Chef Mic.", "Yeah, I\u2019m a picky eater. I have texture issues and won\u2019t eat a lot of foods. You aren\u2019t a picky eater\u2026you are a food snob.", "Well, I think it does require a little bit of empathy on your part to realize that she didn\u2019t grow up with two chefs as parents and she\u2019s probably just learning what really \u201cgood\u201d food tastes like. From your post, it sounds like you were not gentle in telling her how you feel about her food. You have extremely high standards for food, and you shouldn\u2019t expect her to know how to cook perfectly. She\u2019s obviously trying. \n\nI seriously doubt her food is actually disgusting, it\u2019s just not up to your standards. Telling her she shouldn\u2019t cook for you again until she figures it out, is definitely not the way for her to practice or encourage her to get better. I think you really should cook alongside her and maybe teach her some things if she\u2019s willing.", "Then offer to help her instead of being cruel. And before you say you were honest, there are much nicer ways to say what you needed", "You\u2019ve mentioned though that there are dishes that she does do well. Have you told her that? Have you complimented what she makes that you enjoy? Maybe letting her know what her strengths are and encouraging her would help her build a better foundation. Not everyone grew up at the Culinary Institute.\n\nMy husband and I both love to cook and eat 90% of our meals at home, mostly from scratch family recipes that we play around with. When one or both of us don\u2019t particularly like a dish one of us prepared we don\u2019t insult each other, we sit down and discuss what went right and what went wrong so we can make the adjustment for next time. And not in the \u201cthis is too salty\u201d way, but more \u201c I loved how the rosemary brought out XYZ, but it may have been a little high in the sodium\u201d.", "Hes just such a nice guy /s", "And the best restaurant you've ever been to?  \n\n\nEdit: and what exactly tasted *bad* about the food your GF prepared for you?", "*chef kiss*", "\ud83d\ude02 here take my well cooked pasta \ud83c\udf5d", "Perfect response, my friend. If I had an award, it'd be yours. But for now, take my upvote.", "Or maybe some gentle and actually constructive critiquing.", "He\u2019s the one who keeps eating her food. If he really wanted to, he could make his own damn food and shut up about it. But instead, he expects his girlfriend to be his personal professional chef and insults the hell out of her for not being perfect at cooking. I fail to see how that makes her an asshole.", "Such a child\u2026", "I tell her what to, how to cook the ingredients properly and correct her if she's making a mistake. I have cooked for her many times, she has never rejected the food because I make sure to ask if she likes it before cooking for her (like for example she doesn't like most fishes, so I don't cook that for her), she has never told me it tastes bad either because I know how to cook.\n\nI don't understand how she can mess up a meal while she's following a recipe either.", "I suspect he\u2019s a shitty teacher too.", "It's not mansplaining, is teaching her since I know better then her how to perform the task, she doesn't know how to cook, I do, so I teach her.", "He doesn't like her, she probably doesn't exist. This seems all too, troll-y", "Yes, I like her.", "What a w\u2693\ufe0f", "Probably wouldn't even notice if the GF left the kitchen, with how high his head is up his ass", "Based on my experience with dudes like this, I\u2019m not hopeful. But I can only speculate.", "Probably McDonald\u2019s lmao \ud83d\ude02", "Probably my parent's restaurant, but since I'm not gonna say the name then I'd say Azurmendi, in Spain\n\nDifferent stuff tastes bad in different dishes, she won't let me help her", "Agreed, u/DonkeyRhubarb76 closed it down lol.", "Man, three hours into this, and you just fail to see how your approach to this is what makes YTA. \n\nDo you even like your girlfriend?", "> she has never told me it tastes bad either because I know how to cook.\n\nOr maybe her parents just raised her to have manners.", "I find that you don't need to follow recipes unless you're baking, everything else is just tasted as it comes along. Do you think your preferences are different than hers? Maybe she has a different flavor palate than you?", "I\u2019m certain you were a perfect chef from the first time you entered a kitchen. \n\nGod, I hope she\u2019s busy throwing your shit onto the lawn and turning on the sprinklers.", "You are probably right\u2026", "Yeah\u2026 you\u2019re her partner and her equal, not her teacher or her dad. Hence, it\u2019s mansplaining. You really don\u2019t understand what patronizing is do you? Why do you came here and ask if YTA but cannot accept the veredicto that you ARE? \nI feel sorry for that poor girl. She can do better.", "Obviously you're a terrible teacher too then.", "Well, you\u2019ve fooled basically all of Reddit\u2026 wonder how that could have happened\u2026", "Well shit. I\u2019m overwhelmed with that outpouring of emotion. It must be because of the two years you\u2019ve been together. I\u2019ve gotta start treating my wife better based on this response.", "Damn that was good.", "In other words,  the only food that tastes good to me is food that I am familiar with.  \n\nYTA", "I have manners too. My parents also taught me that if someone is failing at something that I know better then I should let them know.", "If in teaching her how to cook then I am her teacher, we're not equal in the grade of the skill, I am better than her and she's learning. So until she learns, we're not equal and I an her cooking teacher.", "No you don\u2019t, and if your parents taught you to talk to people like this- then again I can not imagine how horrible your childhood was", "> I told her that's not enough because her food still tastes like shit. I also asked how can her food taste so bad if she's only following a recipe, like how does she mess that up? Its literally just following instructions. She got angry and called me a cruel asshole, I told her I'm just being honest, she's now not talking to me.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an example of a person with manners, dude.", "Well we keep telling you you\u2019re failing at being a bf, so\u2026.", "If you legit think you are a well mannered or even average person, that  level of self delusion makes me think your own cooking and taste isn't nearly as good as you think it is. Gotta say sounds like you have zero self awareness", "Tell your parents what you said - and exactly how you said it. (Your GF can provide details to make sure they're getting the accurate picture of how it went down.)  And if they're proud of how you treated her, then she should break the lease and cut her losses in this relationship now, because this is not a family she wants to join.\n\nIf, as many of us suspect they would be, your parents are mortified by your treatment of the woman you supposedly love, then give her a heartfelt apology, learn how to communicate with tact, and enroll in some cooking classes together as a bonding experience. \n\nAs of now, YTA.", "So your parents taught you to speak to your loved ones like that? Yikes.", "Dude. You didn't let her know. You hit her with a car, reversed over her and ran over her again then stuck your head out the window and told her it was her fault you hit her on a pedestrian crossing. In case you didn't know, that's another way to say you basically destroyed her feelings. You'll be back soon....AITA My girlfriend broke up with me because she thinks I'm entitled \ud83d\ude44", "> My parents also taught me that if someone is failing at something that I know better then I should let them know.\n\nYeah they aren't wrong at all, but YTA because of the delivery.\n\nYou could have said virtually all the same but with tact and respect.\n\nIf you said, what you claim to have said - then you don't seem to really respect nor care for her. Which is gonna be a problem if not now, then in the near future.\n\nBeing direct and speaking hard truths is great, but always employ some tact in it, especially when directed at your significant other.", "I guess they failed to tell you how to tell people that without being a dick.", "If you have manners, you're definitely not using them here. You're being incredibly rude to your girlfriend, and this is just the text of what you've told us you're saying, without tone or inflection. I'm willing to believe in real life, it's even ruder than it appears on screen.", "Lol that\u2019s not how relationships work. And no, she doesn\u2019t have to accept you as a teacher, who cares if you are all knowing, you cocky jerk. Do her a favor and break it up now before she \u201cfails\u201d to fulfill your every expectation and her self esteem  is reduced to ash. And again, I and apparently the rest of Reddit are also being honest: YOU. ARE. THE. AH!!", "That's not how a relationship works, but I'm sure you won't be in one for much longer anyway.", "My childhood was not horrible.", "\"I'm just being honest\" is always the biggest red flag to me. People who have to say they're just being honest are 100% of the time being AHs.", "She's only failing with the cooking and that can change in the future, that won't damage her self esteem at all."]}
