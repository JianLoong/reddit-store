I spent longer than I should have, defending them/giving them the benefit of the doubt - but to me, their true nature is now blatantly obvious. I don't particularly like the royal family either, but in my opinion you don't have to approve of anyone involved (in order to see Meghan and Harry for what they are). They exploit racism and sexism to deter any valid criticism, and I do believe some people fall for it. \n\nThat Oprah interview (and many of their comments since) were full of demonstrable dishonesty and self-obsession, which certainly didn't require any biased sources (media nor royal family) to point out. Just your own objective analysis of the holes that are always apparent in dishonest claims, and a memory for previous and subsequent claims they have made.\n\nOf course people can disagree with me.

I was on a trip to London a couple months back and we had a tour guide one day that was talking about the royal family (it was a few weeks after the Queen passed) and she kept making all these snide remarks about Meghan. After I told the person in charge of our tour group that they should not hire a racist again.", "He is obsessed if not talking at all is the only reasonable alternative to talking about her.  NTA.  Oh well, enjoy the silence while you can, it won't last long.", "NTA. He had it coming.", "NTA - my dad is the same way. Between his Facebook and the Daily Mail (which he calls \"all the British papers\") you'd think we live next door to her for how often he brings her up. And of course calling him out results in a sulk and \"I guess I'll never make conversation again!\"", "A lot of folks rewrote history in their minds after Diana\u2019s death. People forget the British tabloids went after Diana for \u201cruining the royals\u201d especially after it was rumored she contributed to that book written about her (can\u2019t remember the title but the Crown dramatized it this season) and then the TV interview where she said there were three people in her marriage. So it\u2019s kind of funny to me that a lot of those folks have Diana on a pedestal and spit venom about Meghan now.", "Not kinda, they are.", "Don't forget the people that think her marrying into the royal family think that it's a ploy for England to take over the United States because her children will have American Citizenship so can run for POTUS in the future if they are so inclined. (of course there are a lot of hoops to jump through and nonsense ongoing etc etc).\n\nI mean... the venn diagram of people that believe that and racists is almost a circle, but there are outliers!   \nOP: NTA - your step dad is weird and I'd count him \\*not\\* talking to you as a win.", "I swear she lives in these people's minds and they don't actually think of her as a real person. I got called scum on a post for questioning why they hate her so much ( on a post they were questioning whether or not she was suicidal) and their response was she \"exposed\" a the royal fam on Oprah, I was like what about before that? They said no one ever showed her any hate before that, like are you that dense you just forgot what happened to make her leave?", "Oh god no.  That site is the the same coin, different side.  Those women are obsessed to the point of insanity.  The writer will ban you or delete comments if you say one little thing wrong about her precious Meghan or Harry.  That site is a joke in the gossip blog community.", "I was gonna ask if OP's dad is Piers Morgan...", "Then she's not living in your head rent-free, is she?", "The King is separately the king of Australia as well as the UK (for now anyway).", ">He can clear his record on Facebook and start fresh so he doesn't have the same ad service, he will see way less MM content.\n\nHe wouldn't want to. \n\nBut maybe OP could...", "Oh yes. Happy cake day.", "*she stood him up*\n\nI suspect that he was looking for more than *coffee*.  \n\nI read something once about their being in contact with each other a few years back.  When they actually met each other in the UK things did not go well.....", "Haha, Thomas and Samantha are the names of Meghan Markle\u2019s dad and half sister. They\u2019ve both made a habit of selling stories about her to tabloids.", "NTA a lot of Meghan hate is pretty blatantly racist you are allowed to call it out. \n\n>well its because there was an ad on TV and it\u2019s part of the conversation\n\nTo my knowledge Meghan has not announced her political ambition. It didn't seem life she is a cost member in the show. It was in no way shape or form part of the conversation. He just randomly choose that moment as an opportunity to shit on her. In the weirdest way too. Lots of people would be bad at being president is a really hard job.", "NTA. People hate on that woman so much but NOBODY can say how exactly she bullied anyone. She made someone cry? She was a bride to be and probably stressed. That\u2019s no excuse but we also heard it was actually Catherine that made the person cry. I would like someone to tell me what she said that equated to bullying. Piers Morgan is married but all he can talk about is how she ghosted him. What did he expect? For her to have sex with a married man? We all saw her Twitter message to Piers and it was NOTHING but friendly. Don\u2019t take my word for it. Check it out. He was so mad all he does is fixate on Meghan and Harry. People are mad that he married that beautiful, intelligent, successful black woman. Screw all them because in the end, she is an official Princess/Duchess.", "NTA\n\nThis is kind of a thing with certain people.  They get someone so filled in their own heads that they cannot talk about anything else.  You see it mostly in Trumpeters and Bernie Bros.  They consume any and all media that talks about their chosen person.  It does get old.", "NTA", "That's crazy. I think I'd ask, \"Why are you so obsessed with her?\" every time he brings her up. NTA.", "Exactly what conversation is Meghan Markle being president part of? Because I watch the news every day (sometimes twice) and this is the first I\u2019m hearing of it.", "NTA. Sounds like your stepdad is Meghan Markle's bio dad lol.", "NTA. Meghan Markle isn't running for president. No one is suggesting she should run for president. It sounds like no one brought her up in this conversation, your step dad just spontaneously got angry at the idea that a woman no one was talking about, who isn't running for president, would be a bad president. It's literally like storming into a baby Gap and yelling, \"What the fuck is this?! Jon Hamm couldn't wear any of these pants, he'd look insane!\"   \nDude is obsessed.", "NTA\n\nAnd it sounds like the silent treatment is probably a bonus. Enjoy it while it lasts. These conspiracy types tend to only get worse over time.", "NTA \nMM has literally never come up in any conversation in my family ever. Nothing wrong with talking about her, but yeah, it\u2019s kinda weird that a grown man would mention her more than once. \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s running for president, so he\u2019s probably in the clear.", "Is your stepdad Piers Morgan? NTA", "Is your step father Piers Morgan? NTA", "This! 'i don't like her ' is just a way to be raxust under a guide of something else ..", ">My mom has also bought into the narrative that Meghan is ungrateful, that the royals paid for her wedding\n\nThis is wild to me. Like I know people like the but\n\n1. The royals don't pay for anything the country does\n\n2. She literally had no choice. It's not like Meghan was poor before the age was a successful actress. She probably could have fully afforded her dream wedding. Instead she had to have a televised wedding at a traditional location. She probably had strict rules around things like her dress, hair, and makeup. She probably had no say on things like decorations. Hardly seems like a gift.", "Sounds like your mom is a wee bit racist huh?", "Beat me to it.", "Especially her family. They've been using the media to attack and harass her for years.", "Wait, what? You're not even in the US?! He's this worked up about the idea that a woman (who is not running for President) would make a terrible President...of a country he doesn't even live in?! Dude is obsessed", "You know how on occasion, you\u2019re asked \u201cif you could choose a super power, what would it be?\u201dThis, right here, is what my chosen super power would be.", "Well, it's hard to speak ill of someone who died under such awful circumstances, right? And of course, Meghan isn't part of the British uppercrust, she's biracial, she's had a divorce - there are always going to be people to whom that matters.", "Oh, I agree with you, I think it's nuts. In my mom's case, I think it's because she's older these days (I'm roughly Meghan's age), so she's probably projecting and viewing her as this \"ungrateful whippersnapper\" and siding with the older generation.\n\nI don't really argue with her, she gets upset, and it's not worth it. (This applies to many other topics, unfortunately.)", "No, that's not it. My mom's a POC who married into a white family. So when she was around Diana's age, she identified with her as an outsider among her in-laws. You'd think that would make her sympathetic to Meghan, but now that she's older, she tends to side with her generation. That whole \"kids today got no respect\" thing. So, not great, but not racism.", "Her sister in particular!", "Same", "My dad can't stand him luckily. That's the best bit isn't it!  We're in the UK. We've got our own politics and politicians to rant about!", "There\u2019s a huge difference between speaking ill of someone who died in a horrible accident and putting someone on a massive pedestal after their death despite seeing and treating them completely different during their life.\n\nI understand that nationality, race, and social status are factors that differentiate Meghan from Diana. But that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t hold up the mirror to people who don\u2019t or choose not to remember how Diana was treated.", "I'm not at all condoning the hypocrisy, just... trying to explain it, I guess? Not that I think you need explaining, I'm just musing at this point. But I would hate for you to think I'm defending the media and others who had a magical change of heart.\n\nI'll be fair to my mom, she's always loved Diana. Probably because they were similar in age, and my mom also felt like an outsider among her in-laws. And like I mentioned in another comment, now that she's older, she views the younger generation as ungrateful. So, there's that, too.", "And I bet OPs Dad is all over the Daily Mail website because they are like the frontrunner of anti-meghan stuff *vomit*\n\nOP, you're NTA.", "How do you even know so much about these people? \ud83d\ude02", "Addressed every time, my friend - but these views are absolutely insidious and so deep baked I worry we just have to treat them like a virus: isolate them, make sure they don\u2019t get passed on, and wait for them to die out.", "Because. Of the obsession."]}
