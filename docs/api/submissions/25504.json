Instead of sending the others to the store unsupervised, why not go with them and teach them?\n\nWhat a novel idea, teach a new skill to your kids!  Your job as a parent is to help your kids become independent and self-sufficient.  They do that by learning and being taught, not by waking up one morning with an epiphany.\n\nBesides, you are showing a bit of favoritism by taking the one for rewards without providing opportunities for the others to receive rewards.

Just because one kid is great at this skill, doesn\u2019t mean you get to neglect developing this skill set in your other children. \n\nAlso, this seems like an inappropriate responsibility for a nine year old.

I would also question how much you're putting on your middle child, just to make sure that you're not parent-ifying her and making her take on a lion's share of household tasks while her siblings sit back and live carefree lives. I don't think you are doing that, from the details here, especially since you're rewarding her, but I mention it anyway since we get a lot of posts from clueless parents being like \"AITA for forcing my eldest daughter to raise my toddler while I go out three times a week\" so, you know, better safe than sorry.", "NTA they need to earn that privilege", "NTA.

I still have no idea how my sister did it.", "NTA - all kids are different. Just like at work, you prove yourself with a task, you get new opportunities others might not get.", "I don't think that makes you TAH. I wonder if it'd be possible to have them show their siblings tips as the \"subject matter expert\" kiddo and have your other kiddos teach something that they're better at.

Not everyone excels at everything. Find something that your 12yo is good at and interested in doing for the family and reward her for that.", "I was the shopping buddy/responsible one. Keep rewarding her for doing more work and carrying the house's emotional labor! NTA. I hope you also reward her with having quality chats too and discussing her favorite things, like bath bombs.", "NTA.

Or give them other tasks that allow them to be rewarded. But I don\u2019t blame you for being weary about giving them a task that you know that they might not be able to execute properly.", "NTA.   Play to your kids strengths,  give the other kids chores to do around the house and find what they're good at.

The whole point of being a parent is to TEACH your children. \n\nYour arrangement with your 9yo seems to be working, and that's great.

Nowhere in your posts or comments did you ever talk about what the other kids do really well. Your other kids have strengths. Look for those and reward them. Maybe it won't benefit you in the same way, but you're the one who chose to have 3 kids--this is really not about you. Sit and think about your other kids. What are they great at? Maybe the 12yo could take over lawnmowing or landscaping. The younger one start learning to cook, if that's what they're into. Take over pet care, if you have a pet. There are so many options.\n\nAlso, as a side note, I teach highly gifted teens, and you need to dial it back. You sound like you think of her as perfect, and that's sending up huge warning flags for me. Many highly gifted kids are hardworking and a pleasure to teach. Their parents praised their intelligence, certainly, but didn't make a big deal about it. They celebrated their other strengths too, and those of their siblings. I was a gifted kid-- like, I read the King James Bible at age 8 and understood it. My sister wasn't as academically gifted but she's an incredible artist and creative in everything. We respected each other from the start because our parents valued us equally. I helped her with her math homework, she painted amazing murals in my room and picked out outfits for special occasions. Kids know. Your other kids know you think their sister is better than them. That's a huge problem for all of them, including her.\n\nIf you continue to hold up your 9yo as some sort of prodigy (even if she is!), she's either going to end up insufferable or crippled by paralyzing anxiety because she's terrified of not being perfect.

You're doing the others a disservice by not teaching them to grocery shop just like my mom didn't teach me. You're approaching it as she is so much better than them. You're also driving a wedge between them and her. You do have a favorite whether you admit it or not.", "While the other two are hating you both. You\u2019re crushing parenthood!  /s", "The favoritism in this post is strong. Glad you have a child that does your job as a parent. \n\nShe deserves more than one bath bomb for doing 30-45 mins of grocery shopping for you while you sit on your ass", "And can\u2019t even be bothered to consider her other kids\u2019 skills?? Or worse, just thinks they have none?? So many people don\u2019t deserve the kids they have \ud83d\ude12 YTA", "This is what I do with mine. I'll park up on the way home, kiddo runs in.       \nI do it so I don't end up buying stuff I don't need. I always pick up extra stuff, my kid sticks to the brief.", "If I had a slightly better arm, I could hit a grocery store with a rock from my front door.", "I get what you're trying to do here, but you're missing the point. It isn't stranger danger, it's that the vast majority of Americans are not in walking distance of a grocery store. But sure, let's have the 9 year old walk a mile and a half down a 4 lane highway in burbs to prove our toughness or whatever.", "\u201cIf they live close\u201d. I live in an American west coast city 5 blocks to the nearest store. My niece has walked to grab things multiple times. Extremely easy route. No turns. No major interactions. I\u2019m not trying to prove toughness. I\u2019m just saying there are plenty of kids in my neighborhood that do this as well here.", "Do your other kids get to do fun extra curricular activities as well? Enrichment, enjoyment, learning non-school related skills? Or only the middle?"]}
