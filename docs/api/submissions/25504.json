Instead of sending the others to the store unsupervised, why not go with them and teach them?\n\nWhat a novel idea, teach a new skill to your kids!  Your job as a parent is to help your kids become independent and self-sufficient.  They do that by learning and being taught, not by waking up one morning with an epiphany.\n\nBesides, you are showing a bit of favoritism by taking the one for rewards without providing opportunities for the others to receive rewards.

Just because one kid is great at this skill, doesn\u2019t mean you get to neglect developing this skill set in your other children. \n\nAlso, this seems like an inappropriate responsibility for a nine year old.

I would also question how much you're putting on your middle child, just to make sure that you're not parent-ifying her and making her take on a lion's share of household tasks while her siblings sit back and live carefree lives. I don't think you are doing that, from the details here, especially since you're rewarding her, but I mention it anyway since we get a lot of posts from clueless parents being like \"AITA for forcing my eldest daughter to raise my toddler while I go out three times a week\" so, you know, better safe than sorry.", "NTA they need to earn that privilege", "NTA.

I still have no idea how my sister did it.", "NTA - all kids are different. Just like at work, you prove yourself with a task, you get new opportunities others might not get.", "I don't think that makes you TAH. I wonder if it'd be possible to have them show their siblings tips as the \"subject matter expert\" kiddo and have your other kiddos teach something that they're better at.

Not everyone excels at everything. Find something that your 12yo is good at and interested in doing for the family and reward her for that.", "I was the shopping buddy/responsible one. Keep rewarding her for doing more work and carrying the house's emotional labor! NTA. I hope you also reward her with having quality chats too and discussing her favorite things, like bath bombs.", "NTA.

Or give them other tasks that allow them to be rewarded. But I don\u2019t blame you for being weary about giving them a task that you know that they might not be able to execute properly.", "NTA.   Play to your kids strengths,  give the other kids chores to do around the house and find what they're good at.

The whole point of being a parent is to TEACH your children. \n\nYour arrangement with your 9yo seems to be working, and that's great.

Nowhere in your posts or comments did you ever talk about what the other kids do really well. Your other kids have strengths. Look for those and reward them. Maybe it won't benefit you in the same way, but you're the one who chose to have 3 kids--this is really not about you. Sit and think about your other kids. What are they great at? Maybe the 12yo could take over lawnmowing or landscaping. The younger one start learning to cook, if that's what they're into. Take over pet care, if you have a pet. There are so many options.\n\nAlso, as a side note, I teach highly gifted teens, and you need to dial it back. You sound like you think of her as perfect, and that's sending up huge warning flags for me. Many highly gifted kids are hardworking and a pleasure to teach. Their parents praised their intelligence, certainly, but didn't make a big deal about it. They celebrated their other strengths too, and those of their siblings. I was a gifted kid-- like, I read the King James Bible at age 8 and understood it. My sister wasn't as academically gifted but she's an incredible artist and creative in everything. We respected each other from the start because our parents valued us equally. I helped her with her math homework, she painted amazing murals in my room and picked out outfits for special occasions. Kids know. Your other kids know you think their sister is better than them. That's a huge problem for all of them, including her.\n\nIf you continue to hold up your 9yo as some sort of prodigy (even if she is!), she's either going to end up insufferable or crippled by paralyzing anxiety because she's terrified of not being perfect.

The goal of parenting is to raise self sufficient kids who are capable of doing things like getting their own groceries. Sooo\u2026 I would argue that if OP has one kid who is great at figuring out what items are needed and two that aren\u2019t, it\u2019s maybe not the 9yo who needs the practice.\n\nAlso taking a list and getting the items on the list is a completely different skill set from figuring out what items you need and adding them to the list. The 12 yo at least should be allowed to go buy things from a list. If kid goes and forgets stuff, well, they can go back! Also you could send the kids in pairs or even go with your kid.

So basically, assuming your 9 year old is \u201csoooo smart\u201d lends itself to the outcomes of this study where you or in the study\u2019s case a teacher dotes on a child they assume is smart so they get smarter because of all that extra support belief and attention. \n\nMeanwhile the same opposite is true for assuming your other two children are dumber than her.

BUT I think this is 100% something that should be taught to children as part of a parent's investment in their growth and development of life skills. What you're saying in this and other comments is basically that the siblings are like...shiftless layabouts who aren't taking on adult responsibilities. The oldest is like 12. Thats a child man, and if there are issues with responsibility its on the parent to guide and teach.\n\nSecond is how she's treating the middle child. Like I'm sorry, a 9 year old should NOT be grocery shopping for the family. Thats absolutely ridiculous. Its very clear that this task has nothing to do with teaching life skills to her daughter and EVERYTHING to do with exploiting her. People keep commenting about $10 being paltry but thats an extreme bargain considering grocery apps not only charge for service providers but there is anywhere from a 10-30% markup on products compared to in-store prices. This may seem innocuous but I bet that kid has just a ton of anxiety in general, on top of taking household management responsibilities for the parent at 9. And like it or not this IS alienating the other children (who are AGAIN 12 and 8 year old CHILDREN) and likely causing an unfair and contemptuous dynamic amongst the kids.", "What was the point of asking if you\u2019re an asshole if you can\u2019t handle the answer?
