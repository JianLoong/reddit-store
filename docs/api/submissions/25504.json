Instead of sending the others to the store unsupervised, why not go with them and teach them?\n\nWhat a novel idea, teach a new skill to your kids!  Your job as a parent is to help your kids become independent and self-sufficient.  They do that by learning and being taught, not by waking up one morning with an epiphany.\n\nBesides, you are showing a bit of favoritism by taking the one for rewards without providing opportunities for the others to receive rewards.

Just because one kid is great at this skill, doesn\u2019t mean you get to neglect developing this skill set in your other children. \n\nAlso, this seems like an inappropriate responsibility for a nine year old.

I would also question how much you're putting on your middle child, just to make sure that you're not parent-ifying her and making her take on a lion's share of household tasks while her siblings sit back and live carefree lives. I don't think you are doing that, from the details here, especially since you're rewarding her, but I mention it anyway since we get a lot of posts from clueless parents being like \"AITA for forcing my eldest daughter to raise my toddler while I go out three times a week\" so, you know, better safe than sorry.", "NTA they need to earn that privilege", "NTA.

Not everyone excels at everything. Find something that your 12yo is good at and interested in doing for the family and reward her for that.", "I was the shopping buddy/responsible one. Keep rewarding her for doing more work and carrying the house's emotional labor! NTA. I hope you also reward her with having quality chats too and discussing her favorite things, like bath bombs.", "NTA.

Or give them other tasks that allow them to be rewarded. But I don\u2019t blame you for being weary about giving them a task that you know that they might not be able to execute properly.", "NTA.

Maybe it won't benefit you in the same way, but you're the one who chose to have 3 kids--this is really not about you. Sit and think about your other kids. What are they great at? Maybe the 12yo could take over lawnmowing or landscaping. The younger one start learning to cook, if that's what they're into. Take over pet care, if you have a pet. There are so many options.\n\nAlso, as a side note, I teach highly gifted teens, and you need to dial it back. You sound like you think of her as perfect, and that's sending up huge warning flags for me. Many highly gifted kids are hardworking and a pleasure to teach. Their parents praised their intelligence, certainly, but didn't make a big deal about it. They celebrated their other strengths too, and those of their siblings. I was a gifted kid-- like, I read the King James Bible at age 8 and understood it. My sister wasn't as academically gifted but she's an incredible artist and creative in everything. We respected each other from the start because our parents valued us equally. I helped her with her math homework, she painted amazing murals in my room and picked out outfits for special occasions. Kids know. Your other kids know you think their sister is better than them. That's a huge problem for all of them, including her.\n\nIf you continue to hold up your 9yo as some sort of prodigy (even if she is!), she's either going to end up insufferable or crippled by paralyzing anxiety because she's terrified of not being perfect.

YTA", "The problem is that you're rewarding your daughter because she makes your life easier, not because she did something smart. YTA.", "\nThe fact that you as a parent has the nerve to say you have no faith in your children \u2026 \nI mean, it\u2019d be completely normal if they will not do it right. \nYou has the responsibility to TEACH them, GUIDE them on how to do something right, not looking down on them. \n\nMaybe your 12yo and 8yo aren\u2019t good with grocery list - but they\u2019ll have something they\u2019re good at. \n\nClearly you have your golden child already.", "Mistakes are for learning how to do it right.", "You sound like a parental failure, you\u2019re putting all this onto your NINE YEAR OLD! You too old to be lazy at home and making a child go grocery shopping for you, find other chores the other two kids can be good at and be patient, THEYRE KIDS they\u2019re learning. Get off your ass and be a real parent and teach them something", "If you\u2019re such a perfectionist/don\u2019t have faith in them then why did you have kids if that\u2019s how you feel towards the other two?", "YOU\u2019RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE FAITH IN THEM!", "So you haven't given them the opportunity to try? That is an AH move right there. Let them at least try!", "Then teach them how to do it right. It's awesome that your 9yo didn't need to be taught how to make and stick to a list, but most kids need that. At least your older child should get the opportunity, first with you helping and then on their own.", "But- you also make mistakes. You\u2019ve pointed out that your 9yo does it better than you sometimes. They shouldn\u2019t be expected to meet a standard a grown adult doesn\u2019t always meet.", "The coddling of the American mind. Kids 9. They can walk to a store if they live close. Jesus Christ", "Wow. You are a piece of work. You have your nine year old grocery shop so you can have me time in the car. You talk down about your other children and basically say they are too stupid to do anything. \n\nGet out of your car and go do your grocery shopping. Actively look for achievements that your other children accomplish and then try complementing them on that.  Stop putting the nine-year-old on a pedestal because all you are doing is creating a wedge between that child and the two others. What will happen is all three of those children will eventually walk away from you, because they will realize that you spent their childhood dividing them and treating them differently.\n\nYou are the AH.", "Why on earth are you sitting in the car while your child does the shopping? This is bizarre.", "What an incredibly transactional relationship to have with your own kids \ud83d\ude2c", "Then your middle child is getting preferential treatment, and believe me the other two notice. If you don\u2019t spend some time getting to know their abilities and interests and praising them the way you do with your 9-year-old, don\u2019t be shocked if they aren\u2019t so keen on family time as teens and adults", "The you need to find something. It\u2019s as simple as that.", "Exactly. I was taught to clean the bathroom and so the vacuuming by my mum when I was ten. Those were my two key weekend chores. It was in her own best interests to ensure I knew how to do them properly", "Yes", "They get chores and earn an allowance. This is an extra chore for an extra reward. There is nothing extra that warrants a reward this big.", "If they want to go they can start by accurately telling me whether we have something at home or not.", "I guarantee the non-favorite children already realize this, middle child is going to be both sad and confused because her siblings don\u2019t like her and sick of the burden of being \u201cthe smart one\u201d in 3 years tops. OP is doing *so* much unnecessary damage here it\u2019s insane", "I despise grocery shopping but the grocery store is in the same town where I work and my middle daughter goes to school so it only makes sense for me to go. My middle daughter wants bath bombs so I can get a coffee, she can do the shopping, we load the car, then she gets a bath bomb. I get free time, she gets her bath bomb. We\u2019re both happy.", "Don't call your kids lazy when you have one doing the shopping while you just sit.", "Found the laziest family member.", "Then YTA", "I think that\u2019s not being fair to your other children. Sometimes the achievements of one child can outshine the achievements of the others. I think you\u2019re holding them to too high of a standard. And I think they\u2019re going to hate their sibling when they get older. Try to find some thing that they are good at and reward them.", "YTA. I think this is a responsibility too big to be putting on a 9yo, but it\u2019s not fair to make a reward available to one kid and not the other. You and their dad can teach them new chores that let them earn a reward. Just because you don\u2019t hate a chore doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not worthy of the same. 12yo is old enough to learn to cook a simple meal for the family. 8yo is old enough to do loads of laundry or at least fold it all and bring it to the appropriate room. You might have to supervise, but they shouldn\u2019t miss out on opportunities to learn and earn just because it\u2019s easier for their sister.", "That actually sounds like a good place to start, although it sounds like you may be approaching it from a kind of negative place.\n\nYour older and younger kids may not have your middle kid's ability to notice what groceries you're out of, but lots of people don't and still manage to eat. You could work with them to put together a list. \n\nThis isn't really an area in which having talent should matter: all three kids will, at some point in their lives, need to be able to go grocery shopping whether they have a natural aptitude or not, so it's a good thing for them to learn.", "Okay, so tell them that. Tell them it is now their responsibility to accurately check for what you have at home, so you don\u2019t buy more than you need. Tell them this is an actual responsibility now so they develop the sense for it. Ask them to make a list of inventory so they can keep track of it, like what\u2019s in the pantry or the bathroom storage. When they make a mistake and you end up buying the extra thing, tell them to now add the extra item into their inventory list so they can see the surplus and remember it easier. Make an actual chore of it, don\u2019t just treat it like a casual thing. They will either grow into learning and doing it properly or they won\u2019t. It could be fun for them to have \u201cownership\u201d of this responsibility.", "Well your other kids are unhappy. So fix that.", "If your daughter is as smart as you say she is, you should be enriching her education (with something a bit more stimulating than grocery shopping) as opposed to having her do your job as a parent while you sit on your ass sipping coffee.", "Yet you don't care about other kids been happy, I hope you are happy with just one kid wanting to talk to you in the future", "\ud83d\ude02", "Haha", "She goes to an advanced private school and is in plenty of extracurricular activities. She enjoys grocery shopping and is more than happy to do it in exchange for a bath bomb", "A nine year shouldn't be unsupervised with a credit card because of _other adults_.  She can be easily overpowered while you're enjoying your drink.  Not great.", "Do your other kids go to this same school or are they in public school?", "They\u2019re in public school. They didn\u2019t get into her school."]}
