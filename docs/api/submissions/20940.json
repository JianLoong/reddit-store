So just to be save, she recommended to take it out. \n2 weeks after removing the mole, the dermatologist informed me that it (somewhat) unexpectedly did turn out to be a melanoma. And even quite a big one, especially given my age. \n\nWithin a month I was scheduled for an operation to remove a lymph node and 1 cm surrounding the scar where the melanoma was. The lymph node was checked for cancerous cells to see if it had spread. \nLuckily the lymph node was clean and no cancer was spread. \n\nThis happend 6ish months ago and was quite a hectic time for me.

Cancer is such a spectrum. I know women who have had to get double mastectomies, radiation, and chemo for breast cancer, some only lumpectomies. That doesn't make one person's struggle less valid that the other's. To me, your joke was a little dark humor that you're entitled to make. I had a close friend who had a cancerous melanoma removed in his early 20s and it really affected him and his mental state.\n\nNTA. I think your friend overreacted and, in doing so, invalidated your feelings.", "NTA\n\nYou DID survive cancer.  Anyone who had cancer and got rid of it survived it.  Surgery sometimes does resolve the issue.  It sounds like your friend might have some personal stuff going on or might have gone through a loved one experiencing cancer in a different way and feels like the way you're describing your experience diminishes that of their loved one.\n\nUnsure how to proceed.  Probably best to be compassionate, but also firm that your friend does not get to diminish YOUR experience just because it was different from other cancer experiences.", "My uncle is currently dying because he didn\u2019t get a spot on the top of his head checked out. That spot was stage 4 melanoma that has metastasized to his brain and elsewhere. He isn\u2019t going to get better. \n\nYou know what would\u2019ve happened if you\u2019d done nothing? You\u2019d be going through the same goddamn chemo, radiation and surgeries he\u2019s had to prolong his life. You will have to be checked for years to see if it\u2019s come back because of how aggressive melanomas are. \n\nYou survived cancer. NTA", "NTA. This was my exact situation, although a different joke made and I got a similar reaction.  You survived cancer, you got lucky by only having to have a relatively minor surgery. Things like this aren\u2019t about who had it worse, you had your own trauma and mortality to face, and it sticks with you. Five years out I still over react to every mole that feels or looks off, turns out I just have lots of weird moles, one just happened to be melanoma.", "NTA.\n\nYou had a bona fide cancer and you beat it.\n\nCancers are a broad category of disease and vary a lot in terms of how difficult it is to \"beat\" them and how much hardship the patient who \"beats\" one will go through. Cancer treatments and cures are advancing and more cancers are moving into curable category. Additionally, treatments and cures are becoming less nasty to the patients.\n\nSo, there is nothing wrong saying that you \"beat\" a cancer, even if it took less toll on you through combination of luck (easy-to-cure cancer) and you addressing it proactively.", "NTA. Is your friend a cancer survivor? If not,  this is major savior syndrome.", "NTA\n\nYou had cancer. You beat cancer.  You are a survivor on Day 1 of diagnosis, not because you went through \"enough\" treatment.  You are not guaranteed a cancer free tomorrow. \n\nI think it's fabulous it was caught early, and I am so happy for you.  \n\nI actually have NED (no evidence of disease) Stage 4 cancer- meaning, for now I am not showing signs of cancer.  I have had multiple major surgeries, rounds of chemo, and radiation.   I don't think your fear or journey is any less important than mine.  I've met lots of people who worry that they shouldn't share their story because it isn't as long as someone else's.

Also possibly because there are visible signs of the most common kinds of it, so it's less of this silent, lurking deadly thing that's somewhere inside your body? \n\nIt IS a \"real\" cancer, and it IS a threat to your life. I think where your friend (and many other people) get bogged down is that skin cancer is treated primarily by just...removing it. It is uncommon (not to say it doesn't happen, but far less often) to have to have major surgeries and hospital stays and chemo and radiation and losing hair and, and...all the things people usually think of when you say \"fighting cancer\". Most people who have an experience with cancer wish that it could be taken care of as \"easily\" as yours. \n\nGatekeeping cancer is not the way to go. Who is your friend to brush off your cancer experience? In addition to the procedures you underwent to ensure the cancer was fully removed, you had mental & emotional stress to deal with. Skin cancer is scary. Melanoma is scary. Yes, there is a higher rate of survival, because it's usually caught earlier, but higher doesn't mean 100%, and CANCER IS CANCER. \n\nI'm saying this as a person whose mother died from a rare kind of cancer, and a father who has \\*frequent\\* skin cancer procedures (he's getting ready for one on his face that will likely involve a small skin graft). You had cancer. I'm glad you were able to beat it\\*.\n\n\\*And I'm glad you didn't just agree with your doctors, and actually had it removed.\n\nNTA", "Your \u201cfriend\u201d has issues.

I\u2019m not minimizing what you went through, but I am very, very happy that it was not worse. Seeing someone go through the worst possible scenarios changes you, so I can\u2019t even begin to imagine just how much it changes someone to go through it personally. Your experience is absolutely real, was probably terrifying and painful. But, globally speaking, there are much more terrible versions of that. I do think your friend should not have said that, but I also understand the reaction. It\u2019s not your burden, but if you want, you could ask them if something personal was behind it. My own mother feels the same way about my dad\u2019s skin cancer, even though she knows it\u2019s wrong, because her mother died of cancer in a truly horrific way that is not even comparable. I\u2019m so sorry for what you went through. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ok to say \u201cyou didn\u2019t have it so bad so don\u2019t act like it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d But for some, cancer is a just a black hole of grief and fear and trauma that they can\u2019t escape.

We only care that you beat it, and are living a good life now", "NTA\n\nWhat your friend meant to say is you didn't have ENOUGH cancer. Just a little cancer. An insignificant amount of cancer.

Cancer is a bitch and you definitely beat it by paying attention to the signs and being diligent! NTA", "NTA. You had cancer. You received the recommended treatment. You\u2019re now cancer free. Therefore, you beat cancer. \n\nCancer takes many forms, and requires individualized treatment plans. Some will require more intensive treatments. Others will not. But it\u2019s not a comparison. Cancer is cancer and in any forms has potential to be deadly. So\u2026you\u2019re not wrong for saying you beat cancer. Though it\u2019s important to recognize how your journey differs from others. \n\nThat said, for anyone wishing to downplay the seriousness of your experience, melanoma is actually the most deadly form of cancer and can reoccur. It\u2019s no laughing matter. My husband has had occurrences in the past and sees a skin specialist annually. He\u2019s had reoccurrences, and I\u2019m acutely aware that he will likely have more in the future.

I said that if they were concerned enough to want to check in 6 months I wanted it out there and then. Turned out to be melanoma in situ. Had to go back, get a bigger cut out just in case. \n\nDuring that second procedure another GP in the practice was attending to get more XP and they were talking about them also just having passed a course for identifying skin cancers. They got it 63% right and passed. I thought that was incredibly for pass results when people\u2019s lives can depend on it.\n\nI also had to go to a skin cancer clinic to have the results of the initial removal explained to me because the original doctor was on leave and the practice just gave me the piece of paper with the results when I went to get the first clot of stitches removed.

It was simple, but damn... When I really notice the scar every so often it super freaks me out to know that I had the beginnings of a dangerous form of cancer growing on my skin. It may not have ever gotten to the point of threatening my life, but knowing it could have gotten there if my doctor wasn't so cautious fucks me up.", "Cancer survivor here, twice! Lymphoma. You can have one of my survivor cards OP.\n\nYes chemo sucks, radiation is hell, blah blah blah, you know what the hardest part is? Not knowing if you are going to get worse tomorrow. You survived that part.\n\nNot to mention you were joking, wtf is your friend thinking.\n\nNTA", "I think given the situation (a dark joke with a friend who knows what happened) it\u2019s fine to say they survived cancer.  It\u2019s not as though they\u2019re becoming a motivational speaker based on it, or are trying to garner sympathy, or are claiming it was more traumatic than the reality. \n\nNTA because there was no deception.", "Melanoma isn't even one of the highly survivable skin cancers. Yes if you catch it early it can be less drama but I live in the melanoma capital of the world (New Zealand) and it is in our top 10 causes of cancer death. It's like telling a woman who \"only\" needed a lumpectomy for her breast cancer that she wasn't allowed to say she had breast cancer.", "That's awful to hear. Especially from the doctors who dismissed your concerns", "Don\u2019t compare! My story is similar, I had mega lady troubles while my dad was dying from lung cancer. I had the biopsy they didn\u2019t find anything. Insurance made me try an iud but it expelled by itself and ravaged me up and I nearly bled to death. I had to have a hysterectomy but only the uterus was supposed to go. I\u2019m sure you see where this is going. Yeah I have one ovary left and no cervix. Completely fucking missed the lesion the signs were in my blood work though. Anyways, the point was I didn\u2019t tell anyone in my family except my sister who was living with me and my husband. My thought was, well mines gone now, even though it was a traumatic experience, there\u2019s no point in talking about it when he\u2019s about to die soon. \n\nBut you are a survivor too, just live each day :) it\u2019s hard to get through but I think it\u2019s better not to create levels of suffering needed ya know?", "Unless you go through cancer yourself, you don\u2019t really get to tell OP that she needs to show her friend some understanding. It\u2019s actually the opposite, OP\u2019s friend needs to show a little understanding towards her. \n\n>I can\u2019t even begin to imagine just how much it changes someone to go through it personally. \n\nYou\u2019re right, you can\u2019t. \n\n>Globally speaking, there are much more terrible versions of that. \n\nAnd until you experience cancer yourself (which I hope you *never ever ever* have to experience) you don\u2019t get to have that opinion. Fighting cancer is a physical, emotional, and mental fight. There is *always* fear that it will come back. Learning to live with and cope with that fear is difficult. Especially when you have folks around you who don\u2019t bother to understand your total well being and assume the battle ended after the tests came back clear.", "Yeah, I went to the dermatologist 2 months ago to check al my moles and had another one removed. Today I have an appointment with the surgeon to check my scars.", "I've known her for quite some years, and there is nothing that I know of. I did not expect it to be a sensitive topic for her", "You had cancer, you no longer have cancer, and so you beat it\n\nWho gives a fuck what she thinks, and who tf gatekeeps having cancer?\n\nfind smarter and more compassionate friends", "Your friend is the asshole tbh", "NTA. You had a cancerous tumor removed. That's beating cancer. I can only guess that your friend had someone close to them have a much worse experience. People get a tad tetchy about stuff like this when they watched someone they love suffer and/ or die. It's not rational but it's common.", "NTA, and maybe saying this more often will get people close to you more interested in early detection and avoiding all the bad stuff that comes with cancer.\n\nCheck those moles, for the ladies, check your breasts and for the for the guys, check your testes", "NAH.\n\nI had some suspicious breast calcifications at 31 a year after my younger sister went through chemo and surgery for breast cancer.  We both have some genetic shenanigans so I opted for a full mastectomy rather than a lumpectomy.  It turned out I did have non-invasive breast cancer but since I did a full mastectomy no further treatment was necessary.\n\nAbout five years before I was the sole caregiver to my fianc\u00e9 while he battled Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.\n\nI am going to affirm that you DID \u201cbeat cancer\u201d.  Just like I beat cancer.  BUT I do want to acknowledge that enduring chemo treatment feels a lot different than surgery.  I was super stoked to get surgery so I could avoid future chemo.  People tend to conflate cancer with chemo and I can understand why people might feel a little gatekeepey.\n\nYou know your reality though.  Don\u2019t let your friend diminish your experience.", "NTA, making jokes is how we deal with scary things. You faced cancer, and even when you found out everything was ok that is still something that makes you face your mortality and fear reoccurrence. Maybe just be careful about your audience, like you might not say it to someone who lost a close relative to cancer. Could be why she reacted like that", " A verrrry soft YTA.\n\nThere was no malice, but cancer is one of those things people don't really like to joke about, and we tend to think of beating cancer as long, physically exhausting and debilitating journey. \n\nI'd say you dodged the cancer bullet rather than beat cancer.\n\nMoles being removed is a bread and butter service, it's so common and done quickly with usually just local anesthetic, so i can see how people would get upset at a comparison to a more invasive form of cancer. \n\nI don't think you did anything wrong but i still settle on a very soft you're the arsehole cos a bit better awareness wouldn't have gone amiss.", "NTA\n\nMelanoma is very serious and many people die of it. Bob Marley died of melanoma.\n\nIt didn't get serious in your case because you have pictures (which most people don't do!), go to the doctor to get them checked, and went to several doctors. Most people would have been \"meh!\" And dropped dead in a couple of years.", "NTA. \nYou did survived cancer. She should be happy that you didn\u2019t have to get chemo, radiation. \n\nLike, why is gatekeeping cancer? Cancer that YOU had. \n\nMaybe, she wants attention. Maybe family was in a bad way from cancer.", "I want to explain that bit more clearly. Initially, the mole was indeed removed with local anaesthetics by the dermatologist. \nBut afterwords the tissue around that scar was removed with 1 cm around it, and 3 lymph nodes were removed at the same time and I was under full narcose.", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't claim a long and arduous battle with cancer. You said you'd survived it, which you had. \n\nYou're correct. End of.", "NTA\n\nYou did beat cancer. Has you not advocated for yourself how you did and had medical professionals willing to be diligent that could have been a lot worse. But again, I don't think the degree of suffering a sickness causes to the metric of being able to say you beat it.", "You had cancer in one specific area rhat cancer was removed and you survived cancer my grandad had the same on top of his head NTA just because others had it worse doesn't mean your story isn't your story", "Nta. You had a cancer. It's now gone. You survived it. \nNow the only experience I have had with cancer has been with my dogs. Last one got bone cancer and we lost him 1 week after we found out. It sucked. Current dog had 4 melanomas cut out of his tummy. That also sucked. It cost me a fortune but he survived. \nWhat I'm trying to say is it's stressful regardless of the severity. Cancer sucks", "NTA. People are gatekeeping cancer now? WTF,", "Well, you had a cancer and you beat it. It was small, yes, but still cancer", "NTA you literally did survive cancer?? It was a cancerous mole. What more do you need?", "NTA you had cancer take it from a medical professional, also remember everyone if you find a lump or a mole that change shape, colour or bleed excessively on yourself or a loved one always get checked. Catch it early and save a life!", "NTA - melanoma is no joke and the process surrounding what you went through isnt over, overnight. My father had a similar situation to yours (he also beat a different cancer another tome) but I\u2019ll tell you the worrying on my end was hell. \n\nMany cancers are resolved via surgery and surgery alone- depending on the prognosis", "Nta. I\u2019m a tbi \u201csurvivor\u201d, but I didn\u2019t have to go through relearning everything again, I loved three years without knowing I had it. That doesn\u2019t make me any less brain injured, nor does it make me any less of a survivor. Same goes for you. You had cancer, doesn\u2019t matter the form, and you beat it. That\u2019s all that matters. Btw congrats", "Ladies and gents we have the Pain Olympics winner here. \n\nThey had cancer, they no longer have cancer after beating it therefore they best cancer.", "Other cancer survivor here, twice as well! If you had cancerous cells and now you don't, you survived cancer. Simple as that. NTA.", "Yeah, still...\n\nIt's about the perception of what is generally thought of with cancer, and cancer treatments.\n\nIt's probably wise to discover another way of describing your own experience, as \"beating cancer\" definitely has certain connotations.", "Nah- they beat cancer. Not all cancers need chemo or radiation. They\u2019re entitled to their joke. \n\nThey had a serious cancer and went through a significant process and life changing event"]}
