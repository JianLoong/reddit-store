So just to be save, she recommended to take it out. \n2 weeks after removing the mole, the dermatologist informed me that it (somewhat) unexpectedly did turn out to be a melanoma. And even quite a big one, especially given my age. \n\nWithin a month I was scheduled for an operation to remove a lymph node and 1 cm surrounding the scar where the melanoma was. The lymph node was checked for cancerous cells to see if it had spread. \nLuckily the lymph node was clean and no cancer was spread. \n\nThis happend 6ish months ago and was quite a hectic time for me. Especially since two(!) professionals said it was probably nothing, but turned out to be something. \n\nNow here is where I might be the asshole.

The mood was suddenly a bit grim and I had to leave soon after, so I just left it at that. But now I am left with a bitter feeling about it.

Cancer is such a spectrum. I know women who have had to get double mastectomies, radiation, and chemo for breast cancer, some only lumpectomies. That doesn't make one person's struggle less valid that the other's. To me, your joke was a little dark humor that you're entitled to make. I had a close friend who had a cancerous melanoma removed in his early 20s and it really affected him and his mental state.\n\nNTA. I think your friend overreacted and, in doing so, invalidated your feelings.", "NTA\n\nYou DID survive cancer.  Anyone who had cancer and got rid of it survived it.  Surgery sometimes does resolve the issue.  It sounds like your friend might have some personal stuff going on or might have gone through a loved one experiencing cancer in a different way and feels like the way you're describing your experience diminishes that of their loved one.\n\nUnsure how to proceed.  Probably best to be compassionate, but also firm that your friend does not get to diminish YOUR experience just because it was different from other cancer experiences.", "My uncle is currently dying because he didn\u2019t get a spot on the top of his head checked out. That spot was stage 4 melanoma that has metastasized to his brain and elsewhere. He isn\u2019t going to get better. \n\nYou know what would\u2019ve happened if you\u2019d done nothing? You\u2019d be going through the same goddamn chemo, radiation and surgeries he\u2019s had to prolong his life. You will have to be checked for years to see if it\u2019s come back because of how aggressive melanomas are. \n\nYou survived cancer. NTA", "NTA. This was my exact situation, although a different joke made and I got a similar reaction.  You survived cancer, you got lucky by only having to have a relatively minor surgery. Things like this aren\u2019t about who had it worse, you had your own trauma and mortality to face, and it sticks with you. Five years out I still over react to every mole that feels or looks off, turns out I just have lots of weird moles, one just happened to be melanoma.", "NTA.\n\nYou had a bona fide cancer and you beat it.\n\nCancers are a broad category of disease and vary a lot in terms of how difficult it is to \"beat\" them and how much hardship the patient who \"beats\" one will go through. Cancer treatments and cures are advancing and more cancers are moving into curable category. Additionally, treatments and cures are becoming less nasty to the patients.\n\nSo, there is nothing wrong saying that you \"beat\" a cancer, even if it took less toll on you through combination of luck (easy-to-cure cancer) and you addressing it proactively.", "NTA. Is your friend a cancer survivor? If not,  this is major savior syndrome.", "NTA\n\nYou had cancer. You beat cancer.  You are a survivor on Day 1 of diagnosis, not because you went through \"enough\" treatment.  You are not guaranteed a cancer free tomorrow. \n\nI think it's fabulous it was caught early, and I am so happy for you.  \n\nI actually have NED (no evidence of disease) Stage 4 cancer- meaning, for now I am not showing signs of cancer.  I have had multiple major surgeries, rounds of chemo, and radiation.   I don't think your fear or journey is any less important than mine.  I've met lots of people who worry that they shouldn't share their story because it isn't as long as someone else's.  But the words \"you have cancer\" are scary enough to belong to the \"club\" \n\nSorry for that word jumble, I am already in pajamas. \ud83d\ude34", "NTA, could have been something I said (but maybe I am the A H then \ud83d\ude02). You made a joke your friend didn't like.", "The high rate of survivability for skin cancer makes it considered not a \"real\" cancer by a lot of people. Also possibly because there are visible signs of the most common kinds of it, so it's less of this silent, lurking deadly thing that's somewhere inside your body? \n\nIt IS a \"real\" cancer, and it IS a threat to your life. I think where your friend (and many other people) get bogged down is that skin cancer is treated primarily by just...removing it. It is uncommon (not to say it doesn't happen, but far less often) to have to have major surgeries and hospital stays and chemo and radiation and losing hair and, and...all the things people usually think of when you say \"fighting cancer\". Most people who have an experience with cancer wish that it could be taken care of as \"easily\" as yours. \n\nGatekeeping cancer is not the way to go. Who is your friend to brush off your cancer experience? In addition to the procedures you underwent to ensure the cancer was fully removed, you had mental & emotional stress to deal with. Skin cancer is scary. Melanoma is scary. Yes, there is a higher rate of survival, because it's usually caught earlier, but higher doesn't mean 100%, and CANCER IS CANCER. \n\nI'm saying this as a person whose mother died from a rare kind of cancer, and a father who has \\*frequent\\* skin cancer procedures (he's getting ready for one on his face that will likely involve a small skin graft). You had cancer. I'm glad you were able to beat it\\*.\n\n\\*And I'm glad you didn't just agree with your doctors, and actually had it removed.\n\nNTA", "Your \u201cfriend\u201d has issues. You had cancer. A small one, to be sure. But you had an operation, have a scar, and probably even now are a little traumatized about it. \n\nNTA", "I\u2019ve witnessed what cancer can do to a person. I\u2019m not minimizing what you went through, but I am very, very happy that it was not worse. Seeing someone go through the worst possible scenarios changes you, so I can\u2019t even begin to imagine just how much it changes someone to go through it personally. Your experience is absolutely real, was probably terrifying and painful. But, globally speaking, there are much more terrible versions of that. I do think your friend should not have said that, but I also understand the reaction. It\u2019s not your burden, but if you want, you could ask them if something personal was behind it. My own mother feels the same way about my dad\u2019s skin cancer, even though she knows it\u2019s wrong, because her mother died of cancer in a truly horrific way that is not even comparable. I\u2019m so sorry for what you went through. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ok to say \u201cyou didn\u2019t have it so bad so don\u2019t act like it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d But for some, cancer is a just a black hole of grief and fear and trauma that they can\u2019t escape.

It wasn\u2019t ok of them to take it out on you though, which is why you are NTA.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Cancer is cancer and it\u2019s not a competition. Your experience is just as valid as that of someone who had it \u201cworse\u201d.", "NTA. Cancer is cancer. I survived cancer, and it took chemo, radiation, and surgery. I saw people in the infusion lab and radiation lab that were way sicker than me, but they all applauded when I rang the bell on my last treatment day. Not everyone's fight looks the same, but it was a fight either way.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA, I've had three different types of cancer and survived them all with surgeries, and now a stroke, and the one thing I've noticed around other cancer survivors is none of us care what you had. We only care that you beat it, and are living a good life now", "NTA\n\nWhat your friend meant to say is you didn't have ENOUGH cancer. Just a little cancer. An insignificant amount of cancer. You need to have BIG cancer to qualify for the survivors guild. Apparently.", "You are very fortunate that you paid attention and caught it so early!!! Cancer is a bitch and you definitely beat it by paying attention to the signs and being diligent! NTA", "NTA. You had cancer. You received the recommended treatment. You\u2019re now cancer free. Therefore, you beat cancer. \n\nCancer takes many forms, and requires individualized treatment plans. Some will require more intensive treatments. Others will not. But it\u2019s not a comparison. Cancer is cancer and in any forms has potential to be deadly. So\u2026you\u2019re not wrong for saying you beat cancer. Though it\u2019s important to recognize how your journey differs from others. \n\nThat said, for anyone wishing to downplay the seriousness of your experience, melanoma is actually the most deadly form of cancer and can reoccur. It\u2019s no laughing matter. My husband has had occurrences in the past and sees a skin specialist annually. He\u2019s had reoccurrences, and I\u2019m acutely aware that he will likely have more in the future. While we\u2019ve been fortunate thus far, I\u2019m deeply concerned about the young age at which his cancer appeared and the possibility that his cancer could spread beyond treatment in the future.", "NTA, I also want to add that melanoma could reappear on anyone who has had some of it before. OP will have to monitor to continue to stay cancer free in the future. Friend majorly overreacted.", "I had cervical cancer, it was caught early and small and was completely removed by a LEEP. I was 25, pregnant and my mom was diagnosed with colon cancer the day I gave birth. Obviously my mom\u2019s cancer was worse, as she died from it. But I always felt invalidated because I was diagnosed with cancer first, had the fear of what it meant to have cervical cancer while pregnant. \n\nI just stopped talking about it. Even to doctors. I say I had a surgery, which surgery and leave it at that because \u201cMother died of Colon Cancer at 50\u201d seems soooo much more important than \u201chad a .5mm cancerous mass on cervix at 25 that left a hard keloid scar the size of a pea\u201d. Even the OBGYN when I had my son at 30 dismissed my concerns about the cancer and scar tissue effecting dilation (I dilated to 7cm at about 5 months and didn\u2019t dilate to 10cm until 18 hrs post induction and 6 hrs past epidural.\n\nBut since I didn\u2019t require massive surgery or radiation and chemotherapy my cancer didn\u2019t count.", "NTA. Melanoma is nasty and aggressive when it metastasizes. You did indeed survive.", "NTA - I've had 2 melanomas 2002 & 2009 with conservative margin surgeries on both to be sure it was completely excised- the worry never leaves your mind. Congrats on being a fellow cancer survivor!", "You did survive cancer. It was cancer. Don\u2019t let her invalidate your fear, what you went through and the fear of it coming back.

Cancer isn\u2019t a contest, there is ALWAYS someone worse.  Go you and F her!!!", "Make sure you keep going for 6-monthly checks with a skin cancer clinic for the next 5 years rather than your GP.\n\nMine did a skin check, said they\u2019d like to check a particular mole again in 6 months but it was probably nothing. I said that if they were concerned enough to want to check in 6 months I wanted it out there and then. Turned out to be melanoma in situ. Had to go back, get a bigger cut out just in case. \n\nDuring that second procedure another GP in the practice was attending to get more XP and they were talking about them also just having passed a course for identifying skin cancers. They got it 63% right and passed. I thought that was incredibly for pass results when people\u2019s lives can depend on it.\n\nI also had to go to a skin cancer clinic to have the results of the initial removal explained to me because the original doctor was on leave and the practice just gave me the piece of paper with the results when I went to get the first clot of stitches removed. All I could understand was the word melanoma. Luckily, the skin cancer clinic were nice and explained it to me for free. \n\nI just finished 5 years of 6 monthly checks last year and so far so good.
