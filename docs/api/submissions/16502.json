I happily accepted. We've known each other since we were 5 and we've been close friends since we were about 13. We never had any fights until the last 1-2 years, when we've had more complicated arguments.\n\nMandy wanted me to design some wedding invites for her. She asked me when I'd be able to get started on them mid-December, but I had finals so I told her I'd be busy. 2 weeks later she asks again, after my last final, but I was busy with Xmas family stuff and planning a new year's trip. She never gave me a deadline so I figured it just wasn't very urgent yet.\n\nAbout a week after getting back from my trip, mid-January, I text her asking about the cards. She leaves me on read for like 3 days and then answers me and tells me it's fine, they're done now. Turns out, she wanted it done before new year's, and was waiting for me to ask her about it, but by the time I did, she was already pissed with me for taking so long and stressed about getting it done. So, she decided to start doing them herself like a day before my text to her. I could've helped her work on them if she answered me. I got pretty angry, and I explained to her it felt like she went behind my back. She never gave me a deadline, so she should've told me it was urgent, or at least tell me she was planning on starting it herself.\n\nThe fight dragged on for a bit, then we called and talked about it. She told me she thought she had been clear it was urgent, I told her that wasn't clear at all to me. I apologized for my poor timing and not picking up on her cues that it was urgent. She said she should've told me she started the invites and that she was sorry I felt hurt.\n\nShe also brought up how she felt our friendship has been rocky lately, we've been fighting a lot, and she isn't sure it's a good idea if I stay a bridesmaid. She's worried I will add to her stress on her wedding day. I told her I want to stay a bridesmaid, but it's her wedding so ultimately it's her call to make. A few days later she sent me messages explaining she thought it best to remove me from her bridal party, but she still wants me at her wedding and as her friend.\n\nAdding insult to injury, there are these 2 girls, Sam and Pam, that Mandy doesn't like. Mandy's been ranting to me about them for YEARS, saying how she wants to break off their friendship, but can't bring herself to do it. Mandy and Sam and Pam have drama and fights all the time, but she still asked them to be bridesmaids.\n\nMy mom and my boyfriend think Mandy is being hurtful, but 2 of mine and Mandy's mutual friends said they see both our sides. IDK if I was out of line getting angry over the cards, but I'm also really hurt she doesn't want me as a bridesmaid anymore, so I don't really want to attend her wedding.\n\nSo, AITA in this fight and WIBTA if I didn't attend?\n\nedit: typo, info\n\nINFO: I didn't blow her off when she asked me to start working on them. I answered and asked her a few times when she needed them for/when she wanted me to get started on them and she told me whenever I had time. She did not specify a deadline and that's why I didn't think it was urgent yet.\n\nThe cards thing is basically resolved, what I'm upset about is that she threw me out of her bridal party over this. I am no longer a bridesmaid, just a guest, and that's the main reason I'm hesitating about attending.\n\nMORE INFO: I feel like a lot of people are assuming I kept blowing her off so I just want to try and make things extra clear. I completely understand I could've been much more proactive to show I cared and was prioritizing her, and I did apologize to her for being unorganized and appearing disinterested. I know my communication is something I need to work on.\n\nHowever, I never blew her off. I answered her every time she asked me about it and she basically told me to get them started whenever I had the time. So I thought I had the time. I got home from my trip middle of January and thought, I should get started on those invites. So I texted her asking for details on how she wanted the cards to be. She had only just started working on the invites on her own when she read my text. She then did not answer me for almost 3 days while she worked on making the invitations without me, fully knowing I was ready and available to help her. She then answered me after she finished making the invitations.", "created_utc": 1683326196, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1393s1n/wibta_if_i_didnt_attend_my_friends_wedding_after/", "score": 102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It didn't work out for you to help with this.  That's all it is.  To get MAD because she didn't wait for you to be free to do things for her own wedding when she's already asked you twice is some serious main character syndrome.   You aren't the focus here.  Your involvement isn't what's important.  Her timeline and her preferences are far more important than you getting to be involved with any given task.  Anything more than understanding disappointment that it didn't work out for you to help is a serious overreaction.   She didn't need to tell you that she was moving forward.  Not sure why you thought you were owed a third ask when she's already checked in twice.\n\nIt also sounds like she communicated poorly and refused to give you a deadline when she actually had one in mind.

No the bride wasn't clear but anyone could infer the invites were needed quickly if she wanted any type of RSVP or reception planning.", "I will say, I don\u2019t know her or her general attitude, but especially since the first reason you couldn\u2019t was finals, and you\u2019ve done e-vites before and are supposedly besties, if she was trying to be considerate or not pushy, maybe anxious about stressing you, that could be why she worded it as \u201cwhen you have time.\u201d That being said I\u2019m not saying that is the RIGHT thing for her to do, but I can understand it to an extent. I had a similar approach when I had bridesmaids, they (at least expressed as much) were excited to help and be involved/share ideas and I\u2019d assume they know the sooner the better - especially if the wedding is less than seven months away - and I\u2019d be excited for whatever they got together, and so they had time or made time. Again, this is how those friends and I all kind of think and expect of each other, so not insinuating it\u2019s standard or the best approach for all. Not saying you shouldn\u2019t study for finals, but especially if you were potentially doing just e-vites? Why not do a little prep or design while you\u2019re watching TV in bed, on the plane or car to your trip, just when you have time to yourself, while you chat with family while they do food prep, whatever, I don\u2019t know your schedule but I mean holidays aside I can\u2019t imagine being actively engaged and unable to even mark up a possible option or two in what? A month? Again, if there were a true deadline she had she should have shared it with you, but honestly she is probably disappointed you didn\u2019t appear to put forth the effort or energy into something you said you\u2019d do. She might have felt so upset about it that that led her to just being hurt/sad you weren\u2019t super excited about her wedding and your special part as a bridesmaid and designer of such a special piece (not saying this is necessarily true, but she may have perceived it as such) that she removed you from the wedding because she felt you thought it wasn\u2019t as important or felt like a burden.", "i hear you, op. there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with you wanting to be a bridesmaid. the bride doesn\u2019t sound like a great friend though. i can\u2019t imagine just canceling a friendship over something like this and if she did, you dodged a mess. i hope you have the opportunity again!", "That's key information here, but it doesn't really make sense. Why would she ask you twice, if she is fine with you doing it whenever you have time?\n\nWhat I am reading is\n\n\nShe asks if you want to make cards, you say you are busy with finals. She is fine and tells you to do it whenever you have time. But just two weeks later, she asks you again. That doesn't sound like a person who isn't in some kind of a hurry to get the cards done, but somehow she is again fine with you saying you are busy.\n\n\nCommunication isn't great here", "In the comments it\u2019s revealed that the bride literally said \u201cwhenever you have time.\u201d", "Honestly, I think this is pretty close to what happened. I think I didn't show enough enthusiasm outwardly and she felt I didn't care that much. I did care a lot, I just don't show my emotions much. I also have ADHD and I struggle heavily with planning and the concept of time in general, it's not an excuse, but it does make it harder for me sometimes. I legitimately just thought it wasn't urgent and that I still had time. If I had known she needed them sooner I would've tried to get it done before my trip. I am still hurt she threw me out though, even after I told her I wanted to stay her bridesmaid. I'm just not sure how to talk to her about any of this now.", "Just to add on what the other commentator said as well, there's a possibility you being upset she did them without you, is what pushed her over the edge to ask you to step down. Going forwards from this incident, I've found this:\n\n\"I didn't realise the deadline for this was so urgent, I'm glad you found a solution. This is my upcoming availablity, I have this many hours to dedicate within X timeframe,  is there anything I can help you with within this?\" Is very useful. Upfront telling people  how much time you have available in a specific timeframe, and being honest with what you can supply, is the best way forwards so no one can be mad at you because everyone is aware. For future scenarios."]}
