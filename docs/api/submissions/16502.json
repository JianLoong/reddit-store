I happily accepted. We've known each other since we were 5 and we've been close friends since we were about 13. We never had any fights until the last 1-2 years, when we've had more complicated arguments.\n\nMandy wanted me to design some wedding invites for her. She asked me when I'd be able to get started on them mid-December, but I had finals so I told her I'd be busy. 2 weeks later she asks again, after my last final, but I was busy with Xmas family stuff and planning a new year's trip. She never gave me a deadline so I figured it just wasn't very urgent yet.\n\nAbout a week after getting back from my trip, mid-January, I text her asking about the cards. She leaves me on read for like 3 days and then answers me and tells me it's fine, they're done now. Turns out, she wanted it done before new year's, and was waiting for me to ask her about it, but by the time I did, she was already pissed with me for taking so long and stressed about getting it done. So, she decided to start doing them herself like a day before my text to her. I could've helped her work on them if she answered me. I got pretty angry, and I explained to her it felt like she went behind my back. She never gave me a deadline, so she should've told me it was urgent, or at least tell me she was planning on starting it herself.\n\nThe fight dragged on for a bit, then we called and talked about it. She told me she thought she had been clear it was urgent, I told her that wasn't clear at all to me. I apologized for my poor timing and not picking up on her cues that it was urgent. She said she should've told me she started the invites and that she was sorry I felt hurt.\n\nShe also brought up how she felt our friendship has been rocky lately, we've been fighting a lot, and she isn't sure it's a good idea if I stay a bridesmaid. She's worried I will add to her stress on her wedding day. I told her I want to stay a bridesmaid, but it's her wedding so ultimately it's her call to make. A few days later she sent me messages explaining she thought it best to remove me from her bridal party, but she still wants me at her wedding and as her friend.\n\nAdding insult to injury, there are these 2 girls, Sam and Pam, that Mandy doesn't like. Mandy's been ranting to me about them for YEARS, saying how she wants to break off their friendship, but can't bring herself to do it. Mandy and Sam and Pam have drama and fights all the time, but she still asked them to be bridesmaids.\n\nMy mom and my boyfriend think Mandy is being hurtful, but 2 of mine and Mandy's mutual friends said they see both our sides. IDK if I was out of line getting angry over the cards, but I'm also really hurt she doesn't want me as a bridesmaid anymore, so I don't really want to attend her wedding.\n\nSo, AITA in this fight and WIBTA if I didn't attend?\n\nedit: typo, info\n\nINFO: I didn't blow her off when she asked me to start working on them. I answered and asked her a few times when she needed them for/when she wanted me to get started on them and she told me whenever I had time. She did not specify a deadline and that's why I didn't think it was urgent yet.\n\nThe cards thing is basically resolved, what I'm upset about is that she threw me out of her bridal party over this. I am no longer a bridesmaid, just a guest, and that's the main reason I'm hesitating about attending.\n\nMORE INFO: I feel like a lot of people are assuming I kept blowing her off so I just want to try and make things extra clear. I completely understand I could've been much more proactive to show I cared and was prioritizing her, and I did apologize to her for being unorganized and appearing disinterested. I know my communication is something I need to work on.\n\nHowever, I never blew her off. I answered her every time she asked me about it and she basically told me to get them started whenever I had the time. So I thought I had the time. I got home from my trip middle of January and thought, I should get started on those invites. So I texted her asking for details on how she wanted the cards to be. She had only just started working on the invites on her own when she read my text. She then did not answer me for almost 3 days while she worked on making the invitations without me, fully knowing I was ready and available to help her. She then answered me after she finished making the invitations.", "created_utc": 1683326196, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1393s1n/wibta_if_i_didnt_attend_my_friends_wedding_after/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This friendship carries way too much drama as it is. If you want to go to the wedding, go to it. If you don't, do not go to it. Do not feel like you morally are obligated. However, know if you do not go to the wedding, the friendship will be over.", "I\u2019m not gonna say there\u2019s an asshole in this SPECIFIC situation - but I\u2019ll tell you right now, if that\u2019s how she talks about Sam and Pam, she talks about you behind your back as well.

She should have communicated that she wanted them before New Years", "ESH but you more than her\n\nPeople can't \"go behind your back\" when they are making THEIR invitations for THEIR wedding.  That's simply not possible because they don't need your permission or involvement to make their own invitations.\n\nYou were asked to participate.  Twice.  You had valid reasons why you couldn't.  It didn't work out for you to help with this.  That's all it is.  To get MAD because she didn't wait for you to be free to do things for her own wedding when she's already asked you twice is some serious main character syndrome.   You aren't the focus here.  Your involvement isn't what's important.  Her timeline and her preferences are far more important than you getting to be involved with any given task.  Anything more than understanding disappointment that it didn't work out for you to help is a serious overreaction.   She didn't need to tell you that she was moving forward.  Not sure why you thought you were owed a third ask when she's already checked in twice.\n\nIt also sounds like she communicated poorly and refused to give you a deadline when she actually had one in mind.  Kicking you out of the bridal party was a bit...much, but I understand why she might not want someone involved who takes it personally every time she makes an executive decision as the bride.  \n\nNot going to spite her is petty, but if you're done with the friendship, so be it.  That's probably a good call for everyone, tbh.\n\nSam and Pam are irrelevant.  Not sure why they are even mentioned here.", "I have no judgement because honestly I am not understanding this. \n\nYour friend wanted you to design her wedding invitations? \n\nWe\u2019re you supposed to draw or write one invite and then she\u2019d what?

But you need to know that if you want to keep the fake friendship you should go, but if you are done with her then skip.", "NTA, you informed her of your busy schedule, she responded with a take-your-time. If she wanted to impose a deadline she should have said. I can imagine your focus was on your finals! She should have also told you she got the invites from elsewhere rather than when you approached her to get the ball rolling on design. I\u2019d be very upset at being demoted from bridesmaid because of poorly communicated  expectations. It sadly sounds like the friendship is dying embers.", "YTA, and here\u2019s why. \n\nIt sounds like she texted you asking when you could start the cards. Sounds like you said, not until _____, after my last final. \n\nSo she texted you after your last final. But it was poor timing so you\u2026didn\u2019t give a response? Gave a vague response? Either way, \u201cmid-January after my trip\u201d does not sound like it was communicated. \n\nSo she took care of them herself, stressing because you weren\u2019t prioritizing it. Because you weren\u2019t. \n\nThen, you\u2026got mad?? Really?? \n\nThat was an easy situation to say omg, I had no idea you needed them so soon, I\u2019m glad you got them done, what else can I help you with? But instead, you made it about you. \n\nYTA, don\u2019t ruin what sounds like it has been an amazing lifelong friendship because you got offended.", "NTA\n\nYou were kicked from the bridal party because your life was too busy and hectic to be able to help her with the invitations...during the holiday season. Getting kicked from a bridal party for something small seems reason enough to not want to go but it would be a nail in the coffin on this friendship.", "NTA - she said some hurtful things and didn\u2019t communicate her needs effectively (something useful in a marriage ironically enough), blaming you for not reading her mind.", "YTA\n\nYou didn't pick up that it was urgent, so rather than burdening you she took care of the task. If you wanted ownership of the task you needed to actively take ownership for checking timelines and making plans with her and you did not.\n\n>IDK if I was out of line getting angry over the cards\n\nYou were. And this situation basically snowballed out of your poor decision to get in an argument about it.", "YTA for getting mad/hurt that she started the invitations without you.  She had already asked you twice, and you blew her off.  To get hurt by this is ridiculous.   If you want to continue the friendship you should go to her wedding.  If not, don\u2019t go.", "NTA.
