When I say \"large\", I mean that there are 10-20 identical machines of every type (stair climbers, treadmills, etc.) available to members. Like any gym, there are times of day and times of the year that are busier than others, but honestly\u2014I've never once had to wait for equipment there. And more often than not, I have my pick of the machines.  \nLast week, I went to the gym to hop on the elliptical. There was nobody else using the ellipticals, so I chose a machine at the end of the row, set myself up, pressed play on the latest episode of my fav podcast, and started a 30-minute workout.\n\n  \nAbout 3 minutes into my session, a woman walks behind my machine, steps up onto the machine immediately next to mine, and starts working out.\n\n  \nLet me reiterate: there are 10-20 identical elliptical machines. They are lined up in 3 consecutive rows. They're all very visible, and they are all exactly the same manufacturer/exactly the same functionality.  \nSo now we're two strangers, silently working out right next to each other in a nearly empty room. I felt crowded and uncomfortable, and increasingly annoyed. Because I wasn't very far into my workout, I hopped off the machine, wiped it down, and moved to a machine in the next row back and started over.\n\n  \nWhen I did this, she turned around looking very confused about why I moved, and gave me a look that I interpreted as \"wth?\" As though I had potentially offended her.  \nI should note, this is not the first time this has happened. In fact it happens at least once every couple months, with people of all genders. It's rarely someone being a creep. They just get on the machine and start working out. Whether I move to a new machine depends on how far I am into the workout, but honestly\u2014I'm really sick of moving! I know I can't change other people's behavior, but there's part of me that assumed there was an unspoken social understanding (especially in a post-pandemic world) that you just kinda...let people have personal space unless you absolutely can't avoid it? idk.\n\n  \nThe psychology of the folks that hop on the machine next door has confounded me for a long time, and I have always wanted to ask them why they chose that machine when there are others available.\n\n  \nSo on this occasion, I did. I saw the woman in the locker room as I was leaving, and I said \"hey\u2014this might sound odd, but is there a reason you chose the elliptical right next to mine earlier?\"\n\nShe responded \"I don't have to justify it, you don't own the gym.\"\n\n  \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1686319407, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1456542/aita_for_being_fed_up_with_people_at_the_gym_who/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You wanted to know if there was a specific reason she wanted to work out next to you, and she's not obligated to give a reason if she doesn't want to.", "NAH - I would turn this into an experiment.  Try going to a middle machine for a month and see how many times someone uses the machine directly next to you and note if they were male or female.  Try the end the same way.  I would even use machines in different rows regularly.  You might learn something about human behavior.\n\nAs far as the actual issue, you have a right to any machine open.  The other person has a right to any machine open.  You have a right to move to any other machine open at any time.  Seems like you both exercised your rights.", "NAH- I\u2019m in the gym 5-6 days out the week and much prefer my personal space if I can opt for it. I don\u2019t always get it, and I\u2019ve not made a point to move if someone gets on the stairmaster/treadmill next to me despite there being empty ones abroad, so I just started letting out some nose-burning protein farts until they get disgusted enough to leave.", "NAH. Confounding to me too, but I don't think there's anything reasonable you can do about it. Plan to move, expect it, etc. Make it a game. Need to move - 20 jumping jacks, lol.  That way it'll seem like a part of your routine.", "NAH\n\nAt least not intentionally. I have learned there are people called 'extroverts' who enjoy being WITH people, as much as I enjoy being by myself. This desire to be near and talk to people extends well past their friends and acquaintances. Apparently, they are actively seeking out MORE contact with MORE people all the time. As offensive as it is for us normal people to take a position far from any other humans, they find it offensive if we don't choose to be in their immediate vicinity and try to engage them in conversation or other interactions. \n\nIf there are so many empty machines, perhaps you can have an imaginary friend, and put a towel/drink on the machine beside you so they think your space is already occupied by another human.", "I do get it....but also it's not that deep to get worked up over. I feel like 90% of people are in an auto pilot in the gym and don't really \"think\". I have my usual machines in the gym. Mainly because there may be 20 treadmills but 3 different types. I have one specific type I like.\n\nAgain, I get it's annoying but I wouldn't let it ruin your workout.", "NAH.  These are not urinals; these are gym stations.  People are free to use any open machine without explanation.  The issue is yours.\n\nIn many countries, it's the height of rudeness to sit (e.g. on a bus) or otherwise be far away from another person who is in the same space as you.", "NAH. It's weird for someone to choose that spot right next to you. I wouldn't like it either. She is 100% correct though, there is no rule that prevents it.", "I'm not saying its the case here, but I try to use the exact same machine (elliptical/treadmill) every time I go to the gym because even if the machines are supposed ro be exactly the same they might not be. I've used a cross trainer and then the next week when it was full picked a different one and at the same resistance level it felt harder. My PT has mentioned that she's noticed that some of the treadmills dont actually run at the same speed even if on the screen it says that, and told me to try and pick the same machine every time for consistency. Doesnt make a huge difference probably but maybe thats why? At least for some people. \n\nAlso a factor is some of the machines are directly in front of the AC, so I sometimes pick those ones because the gym I go to is always hot unless you are directly in front of an AC.", "NAH, but seriously, it's not that deep. And I'm sure she didn't do it to annoy you. I have a preference for what treadmill I use, regardless of how full or empty the room is. I guess that's weird but it is what it is. I genuinely don't think about other people when I'm at the gym. Honestly, I just want to get done so I can get the hell out if there, lol!", "NTA. We live in a society where personal space is valued. This is a lesser version of standing right next to someone at the urinal, which is asshole behaviour.", "Okay, I was leaning towards N A H until you actually confronted her about it. That flipped this into soft YTA.\n\nKeep in mind, I totally get where you\u2019re coming from and value my space as well\u2026..but you\u2019re in a very public setting. She can pick any machine she wants that isn\u2019t in use, for any reason so long as they aren\u2019t being a creep which does not appear to be the case in this instance. Either suck it up or move, but don\u2019t say anything to them or confront them about it. Leave them alone.", "NAH it\u2019s obviously the culture at your gym. Hopefully the realize that you don\u2019t like it. I chuckled.", "NAH. You feel crowded by people, you probably should work on that but\n\nBut yea, the psychology of it is fairly well understood. Many people feel more comfortable in the proximity of others. Working out on a machine away from others exposed them and makes them stand out. If they're beside you there's safety in numbers as well as a certain amount of blending in. Same reason why a lot of people won't go into an empty restaurant or sit at an empty bar. At a guess you love those things.\n\nIt's also common in carparks. People park far away from other cars to avoid door dents or whatever and they find, even in an empty carpark with much more convenient free spots, people park directly beside them.", "NTA- and I'd have love to respond to her and say- I\"m not asking you to justify it, I just would like to try to understand. If you don't care to talk, so be it.", "YTA \n\nLeave her alone. She can pick whatever machine she wants. If the person next to you isn't creeping on you, just suck it up and keep working out or move yourself. They don't have to cater to your feelings.", "YTA - Unless you are on your own property, these machines are for everyone.", "YTA for expecting others to follow your idea of what's common sense.  You can find it weird they pick that machine next to you, but like the person said; it's not your gym. People might prefer a certain machine, people might push themselves harder if they are next to another person, who cares. If it bothers you, just move (like you did)", "Yta - soft only bc you\u2019re getting annoyed about people utilizing public spaces and by people choosing to work out on the machine they want to exercise on. They pay the same gym membership you do, so as long as they are not violating the rules of the gym, they can do what they wish. You can pick your machine and they can pick theirs - no restrictions. \n\nYou can ask why they choose that one and you can move. Both are totally okay. But, if you do with with an attitude, then YTA.\n\nThe people you ask don\u2019t have to give an answer - that\u2019s their right. You don\u2019t have a right to know their answer, nor do they need to defend their choices to a stranger. \n\nI would say you need to chill - it\u2019s not a big deal. If it bothers you, then you move like you did.", "YTA. It's a public gym and people can work out wherever they want. She's doesn't care about you, she's working out on an elliptical. This is a YOU problem that you're all in your own head about. \n\nIf you don't want to work out around other people, stay at home.", "YTA- it sounds like you\u2019re a woman, since you saw her in a locker room. It\u2019s entirely possible that she preferred to be next to another woman because it makes her feel safer from unwanted advances from male gym members. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you have an obligation to stay next to her, but it might be something for you to think about in the future. And what makes you TA is that you confronted her about it. Because she\u2019s right, she can use whichever machine she wants.", "I was going to go with NTA until you confronted her. She is free to choose whatever machine she wants and doesn't have to explain anything to you. YTA.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe is right with that: \"I don't have to justify it, you don't own the gym.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou were fine to switch machines, though.", "YTA, get over yourself. \n\nYou want absolutely privacy? Get a home gym.", "YTA their psychology isn't the problem, yours is.", "NTA for not wanting anyone beside you but she's also NTA for wanting to take that one beside you. There are a number of reasons for it. Perhaps she works out regularly and that one is the one she uses each time. Perhaps she simply wanted to be near someone. Perhaps she didn't notice until she's already chosen one that it was beside you. Perhaps she just walked in and chose it for no reason at all. \n\nWhat I'm saying is either get over it or keep moving but no one is exactly WRONG here.", "YTA. Gross dude! How entitled can you be??
