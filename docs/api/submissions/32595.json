In July I got a flag on my credit report someone tried to cosign my name on a private student loan. \n\nI found out my brother somehow got the information from my mom thinking I wouldn\u2019t notice. Tim is on the spectrum. He doesn\u2019t have great judgment but my wife was pissed because we are living with my inlaws (on the other side of the country) saving up for a home once (if) the interest rates drop. I have kept my credit flawless. \n\nSo I did the things you are supposed to do report it for fraud. I tell my mom and she doesn\u2019t say much. It slowly comes out that my brother couldn\u2019t get a loan and he found some paperwork about my parents will that had my ssn on it laying around. He couldn\u2019t get the loan without a co signer and put me down. \n\nIt takes months for this to come out. So my wife and in laws pressured me to file charges on Tim. I told my mom what Tim did was wrong and illegal. My mom started crying and handed the phone to Tim and I explained to him about what he did and he needs a lawyer. Again Tim is autistic and started panicking about what will happen to him after the headache of his actions and everything going on I said \u201c guess you go to jail\u201d \n\nSince then Tim went into a bad state and his meltdown caused him to be on psychiatric hold. He\u2019s in bad shape and my family blames me because he keeps saying I\u2019m going to jail. I don\u2019t know if he actually would for what he did but because of what I told him he\u2019s regressed bad and has been in a panic for weeks and is not getting any better. My parents did get him a lawyer to try to calm him down but he\u2019s back in the hospital again for another stay.", "created_utc": 1702047531, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18domcm/aita_for_telling_my_brother_i_guess_you_go_to_jail/", "score": 2705, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe your brother\u2019s autism mitigates his criminality somewhat. Maybe. \n\nBut the lender is culpable and you might have cause for action against them.", "NTA. Identity theft and fraud are serious crimes. Has he never been held accountable for his actions?", "NTA.  It also sounds like your mom knew what was going on and perhaps helped him.

This is fraud, no sugar coat.", "NTA. Being autistic doesn't mean he doesn't understand right from wrong.

Crime victims and witnesses can make reports to the police; but only the district attorney has the legal power to charge anyone with a crime. That they did so in response to your report indicates that what happened to you is serious. \n\n2) For a first-time offence, he is unlikely to actually go to prison - depending on the amount of money at issue, I suppose. But probation and fines is more likely. \n\n3) I have lots of friends who are autistic people. None of them have ever committed wire fraud. \n\n\"I guess you go to jail\" is maybe a bit mean; but then again, he committed a crime against you, that had the potential to cause you some real harm. For him - or your family - to then make the whole thing about his own mental health is really responsibility-denying. NTA.", "INFO: I have no idea what goes into resolving this with your credit. Did you need to press charges to have this removed from your history? Were the criminal charges a necessary byproduct of reporting the fraud? Or was the decision to press charges totally yours?\n\nAlso, are you really sure he's going to jail?\n\nBasically, NTA for doing what you have to to get this off your credit history. Your brothers diagnosis doesn't excuse his behavior. But the \"I guess you're going to jail\" part does feel like you are twisting the knife because you're mad.", "Freeze (not lock) your credit with all four credit reporting companies so this doesn\u2019t happen again. Also do it for your wife. It\u2019s free, but it\u2019s inconvenient.

They are just like other kids. The kids that are the problem are the ones whose parents told them they are on the spectrum and now every behavior, every actions is because of their \"autism\".

Your brother and mom will either:\n\nA. Serve time in jail for identity theft\nB. Pay a fine for said identity theft\nC. Both\n\nNot your fault, and you should denounce it. Being on the spectrum or having any sort of mental/emotional condition is not an excuse and doesn\u2019t mean he can get away with a federal crime. Also, your mom breached her confidence by allowing your brother to \u201cstumble upon\u201d your SSN and information. It\u2019s not your fault at all.", "NTA. Autism is an explanation for his actions but are not an excuse for them.", "As an autistic let me just say that we absolutely are accountable for our actions.", "NTA.

I would report it.", "NTA. Fuck him. Let him experience the full consequences of his decisions.  He is autistic but he still knew exactly what he was doing and that it was wrong.  It's an insult to autistic people that he's using his diagnosis to escape responsibility. \n\nGood credit is necessary for a good life,  especially if you're working hard to buy a home.  For him to rob you of having a stable place to live and own could have generational consequences. Do not let this go.", "Nope, NTA and by the way this reads, your mom/parents never allowed him to be held accountable; I\u2019m guessing because \u201che\u2019s autistic\u201d. \n\nBeing autistic isn\u2019t an excuse to not be held accountable for his actions!

I dont give a fuck how autistic someone is, stealing anyone's ss number is a big fat crime.", "NTA the problem with enabling people based on a mental disorder is that they're still people who are more than capable of scheming and wrongdoing like all of us are. if you excuse people too many times the lines become blurred and one day it's something highly illegal.", "NTA, identity theft is not a joke Jim.", "NTA. Your mom is also to blame for this OP. It's not your fault he's having meltdowns because of his own actions. And it's not your fault your parents haven't taught him right from wrong and the consequences of certain actions. And if he can't be taught those things because he's autistic, then I don't think he should be going to college anyway. \n\nThis sounds a lot to me like mom and dad have always sheltered and excused OPs brother because he's autistic and let him get away with murder and this is what happens when you do that.", "NTA at all. I would be super sus of your parents for giving him access to your ssn etc. Seems like they knew about it and didn\u2019t want to co-sign for him so he got desperate.", "Getting some Chris Chan vibes from this", "NTA. Especially since you are going to have to press charges anyways to get this off your credit report. Even if you declare bankruptcy, you can't get rid of it. Your brother knew what he was doing and he's the one that fucked up, not you.", "NTA. I get autism is a spectrum, but he clearly wasn't too autistic to try and pull this stunt and he would've gotten away with it if you hadn't found out. I'm not saying he not on the spectrum, but it almost seems as if your mother was the kind to coddle and baby him because of his mental problem. At that point, it's less about being afflicted with it and becomes more of a crutch and excuse to try and get away with things without any consequences. You need to make sure you double down and stick to your guns. The second you forgive him and take the pressure off or excuse because of his autism, you're just enabling him to do the same thing to you or somebody else", "So typically as a rule I keep my credit frozen which prevents hard or soft inquiries unless I unfreeze it. I started doing this after my ssn was stolen but it\u2019s honestly a great prevention method also nta", "Either Tim is legally responsible for his actions, or he isn't.  If he isn't legally responsible, then the fraud conviction should be voided, but he also shouldn't be allowed to sign contracts.  And he needs a lawyer to figure that out.\n\nWere there other ways to handle this?  Well... maybe.  But I am not sure what they are, and they would mostly end up the same way.  You can't cosign for a loan for him without destroying your financial goals, so you would have to get off the loan, and the only way to do that would be to prove that you didn't sign it, which means you would need to prove fraud.  And maybe there is a way to do that which starts out with having Tim declared legally incompetent instead of criminally liable, but I don't see how that's a whole lot better.\n\nTim couldn't simply undo the loan easily.  It's a long-term contract - you can't really just take a mulligan and say, \"Oops, my bad.\"  \n\nCould you have been a little more tactful than saying, \"guess you go to jail\"?  I suppose you could have, but it's not the way that you said it that is breaking Tim - it's the actual consequences of what he did, and being straightforward and plain about it is about as good as you can do.\n\nSo... I don't see what else you could have done, not realistically.  You could have covered up Tim's fraud at the expense of your own financial security, and he probably would have defaulted and taken both of you down.\n\nIf the lawyer is persuasive enough, and the loan company is willing to play ball, I can imagine that the long-term consequences of being charged with fraud may stupidly less serious than the lifelong millstone of the debt he would have carried.  It's not impossible that you calling him out for fraud may have been the least-bad outcome *for him* in this situation.  The fraud would have come out eventually anyway, and this makes him deal with the situation before he sinks further.\n\nNTA", "it may have been a flippant comment, but in your shoes I would've done and said the same things.", "NTA.

Just because bro is on the spectrum doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t know right from wrong. Also I propose mom and dad have spoiled and coddled him.  Let them deal with him. Or not. Consequences my dude.", "NTA The maximum time in prison for identity theft is 15 years, if his autism is truly as bad as he says he might get some time knocked off. By the time he gets out he\u2019ll be somewhere between 30 and 40. That\u2019s still plenty of time to do something with his life. Most artist don\u2019t really get into their prime until around that time. Sure, he probably won\u2019t get into film school and it\u2019ll be hard for him to get jobs, but that\u2019s a consequence of committing a crime.", "Clearly NTA-  he definitely deserved to hear that and feel it. but if there\u2019s a way for you to get it removed from your credit history, have him return the money to the lender, and not have him face jail time, obviously I would go that route. If he does go to jail, not your fault obviously, but I\u2019m just saying if there is an option for you to get your credit cleared without him in jail I\u2019d try to go that route. I think he\u2019s definitely learned his lesson and after that he\u2019ll owe you one.\n\nOn the other hand your parents are fucking idiots for blaming you for his psycho behavior. They\u2019ve clearly coddled him. Being on the spectrum doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s incompetent or beyond scrutiny. He\u2019s obviously smart enough to figure out how to steal your identity, so he deserves to face consequences. \n\nThe only reason he\u2019s throwing a tantrum is because it\u2019s always worked for him.

Continue pursuing justice. If your brother sincerely cant stop and think \"this is bad. I should not do this\" when it comes to IDENTITY THEFT, that person cant be in society. Hopefully the court will see his mental health struggles and keep him in a hospital ward where he probably should stay until he has a grasp on what is acceptable behavior and what isnt. If he CAN stop and think \"this is bad. I should not do this\" when it comes to IDENTITY THEFT, then he belongs in jail. Its literally that simple.

I also believe if we're only acting without bias and this isn't personal or an emotional attack, the mom may share liability in aiding and I would find it very telling if the party with a mental disability is being held fully accountable regardless of their condition, but the person who is of sound mental is being brushed to the side, let of scot free\n\nI wouldn't want the brother to get away though without punishment, he clearly can function well enough to apply for classes, and knows right from wrong, it's just hard to fully judge this because his receptors for accepting blame and dealing with guilt are literally putting the guy in a mental crisis.\n\nPeople on Reddit fawn over the celebrities they love who've they classify as having been \"genuinely good people\" who've suffered substance abuse, depression, mental illness and committed sui****, and if they could bring those people back they would in a heartbeat, like Robin Williams, Kurt Cobain, Anthony Bourdain. These peoples deaths have been mourned and they weren't always good people, yet people choose to only see what they want or love them for the memories that created and ignore their transgressions.\n\nAll I'm saying is that the brother isn't faking having a psychiatric meltdown.

He understood what he did. \n\nOP says in their comments that their brother understands right and wrong, but their parents always shield him from concequences. Now, he's facing consequences and freaking out.", "It depends on how much money you need. Mine cap out at ~$9500.

The Uni sets the price of college, so what the market will pay.  \n\n\nFed loans drove up the price of college because they're backed by the government, obviously unlike private loans. Universities quickly figured out that no matter what they charge, the government will step in and pay back those loans if they default. But what's key is the Uni still gets their $$ from the Fed loans. With private loans via a bank, what if the bank goes bankrupt? There's no guarantee the Fed will bail out the bank. And there's no guarantee the bank has enough $$ to pay the Uni back.
