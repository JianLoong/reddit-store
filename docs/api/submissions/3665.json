If she had, say, heard he was adopted from his school records, and privately said happy adoption day, I would see it as well meaning but misguided. But she ASSUMED  he was adopted? Based on what, not looking like you? Kids don't look like biological parents all the time, especially if they are mixed race. And since you're his dad, too, for all she knew he could've been the product of an affair. Or not known he was adopted! Or been an older adoptee who had intense trauma about losing his biological parents! There are so many ways this could have gone so much worse than just this.\n\nAbsolutely she is TA. And I'd report the second email to the principal tbh. She needs to understand that a) she hurt a child's feelings through this and b) a kid being a little upset is far, far better than how this could have gone.\n\nUnrelated, sometimes you can find local adoptee play groups  and the like.

The OP's conversation with her indicates she does this often.\n\nIdeally, training on the school board or county certification policies on these sorts of things would be the long and short of it. I say this as someone with a spouse and many family members employed in K-12 and collegiate roles as their primary jobs, while teachers are paid criminally low for their responsibilities that isn't an excuse to underestimate the damage that can be done by thoughtless actions with young children.", "Partial comment stolen from: /u/flabbyabb \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9on8s/aita_for_snapping_at_my_sons_teacher_after_she/iyhpg7g/\n\nBot Reported.", "so situations such as the one you find yourself in now don\u2019t occur.", "Why do you not want them to know? If it could become the source of bullying like you fear so much, surely the best course of action would be to let the teacher and school know so that they can step in if they witness any bullying?\n\nIn any case, this deep, deep shame you both have surrounding his being adopted is definitely hurting his psyche and self esteem more than this event with the teacher. YTA", "Yes. That's why I vote ESH instead of YTA. I don't think the teacher acted out of malice and she acknowledged her mistakes, hopefully will learn from them moving forward and respect her students' privacy regardless of her intentions, but the fact she transgressed a student's boundaries (and that she admitted she didn't learn about the adoptee status from him directly) makes her an AH in the situation. \n\nHowever, OP is an AH without a doubt and he's doubling down on it. His later comments about refusing therapy for his son and about his view on the world are rather disturbing and sad. In my opinion, this child feels so negatively about his adoptee status because of how he's being raised and the principles he's learning at home.", "There is no training like this in the \u201cbook\u201d.\n\nOne parent could have loved it and welcomed her with open arms whereas OP didn\u2019t.\n\nYou don\u2019t know until you know and only life gives certain expertise.", "He quite clearly states he is a he and he is a single dad. Not she/mom fyi", "1. I never denied that the teacher was wrong in her initial actions. She overstepped Mason's boundaries. She owed him an apology and she gave him one, though. \n2. There is nothing in the post that says she singled him out, she handed him a personal note. Unless Mason chose to share that note with others, then nobody else knows what it was about. It was still wrong of her because that's Mason's private matter that he never discussed with her. But there was no singling out and no shaming whatsoever, in my opinion. \n3. The dad was unnecessarily rude toward the teacher even after she apologized, he seems to think her having feelings is some sort of aggravation toward him and the way he writes about her is fairly aggressive, as far as the post goes. And in comments, he has openly shared how \"people are horrible and will prey on your weaknesses so hiding them is the right course of action\" is his life motto, and that he will not get therapy to help Mason process his feelings about his adoption because therapy cannot change the way the world works (according to him).   \nNo wonder the kid feels so strongly about hiding the fact he's adopted and freaks out if anyone tries to empathize with him about it. That's how he's being raised.", "She quietly gave him a small note. Where was the calling out?", "That's a small blessing at least. Still, could have been disastrous.", "Did she just assume he was adopted because she can \u201ctell\u201d? Because I think that\u2019s what makes the difference here. What if he looked like his mom and she left him and he was traumatized or what if he didn\u2019t know he was adopted? \n\nIf she 100% knew he was adopted and that your son knows he was adopted, I really think she was just trying to reach out and let him know someone is there for him. If it was me, I would have spoken to you first about talking to him and sharing my own adoption story, so he knows he\u2019s not alone. There IS someone else in the school who was adopted. There is nothing wrong with being adopted. My childhood best friend was taken and put into foster care and eventually adopted. This was the best thing that could have happened to her.", "Imagine if tigers could fly. The question isn't whether the OP was TA in some imaginary world, but whether they were in the real world.", "100%\n\nThis has Op\u2019s problems written all over it. Kids can be rough but they can also be massively compassionate.\n\nI\u2019ve worked in elementary schools and I don\u2019t see a lot of  \u201cteasing\u201d of kids who were adopted.", "Therapists are very good at teaching people how to manage feelings, and how to cope with the unpleasant aspects of life. I'm glad you are talking with him, but there is a huge difference between what you will be able to share with him, and what a trained professional, who makes it their life's work to help children, can share with him. A therapist is going to know tools and practices and viewpoints, that may have never occured to you, that he can use to deal with everything.\n\nThat opinion of yours is troubling. Why would you NOT want to get your child help? He is obviously struggling with his adoption. He loves you, but being an adoptee is troubling to him. A therapist can help talk with him and reframe it in a more positive way, as well as teaching him ways to handle life's AHs along the way.", "Even if you don't think so, adoption is traumatic for a lot of people. Your kid needs to be in therapy to address things that might not have fully come to the surface yet. Even if he has had a great upbringing so far, he was still separated from his birth parents at a young age.", "You aren't a counsellor who can give him the tools he needs to discuss these things in a way that he can process them. I understand that any difference at that age makes a kid stand out. What I mean is that he seems to perceive being adopted as bad. **That is something that needs to be worked out so that he understands the difference between bullying and the fact that there is no stigma attached to being adopted**.\n\nPlenty of kids grow up knowing they are adopted and are completely fine with it. They also have genuine friends who could care less that they are adopted. It is worrisome that you don't see how you are reinforcing his hatred of people knowing he is adopted.\n\nFor instance, the teacher wrote him a personal note that was meant for him only. She didn't announce it in front of the class or anything like that. She sent him a little note wishing him a happy adoption day.\n\nObviously, that was none of her business. But, his reaction to the very idea that his teacher knew he was adopted is concerning. He deserves to have a professional help him deal with those emotions rather than causing him further trauma every time someone discovers he is in fact adopted.\n\nWhatever the case, I truly hope Mason gets to a point where he is accepting of the fact that there is nothing wrong with being adopted or with people knowing that he is adopted.\n\nEdited to add emphasis as to why I suggested counselling.", "I was going to go with N T A until I read this comment, so therefore YTA.\n\nYou are doing a HUGE disservice to your kid by not getting him therapy. Will therapy stop bullies? No. Will therapy help him regulate his emotions so that if someone does bully him it won't bother him? Yes!\n\nHonestly, I would do a little self reflection OP. Many of us adults do not know how to properly regulate our emotions because we weren't taught. We think \"well my parents did XYZ and I'm fine so that must work\" and thats just not realistic.\n\nObviously being adopted bothers him to some extent. Having talks with you isn't going to make that go away. He needs an unbiased third party to help HIM come to terms with it and accept it so that when/if someone tries to bully him for it, it will not emotionally effect him.", "it sounds like you need therapy too. what a pessimistic worldview.", ">Anything difference that can be weaponized and used to bully or isolate a kid is a potential stigma\n\nWhile this is true, therapy equips you with the tools to deal with it in a healthy way.\nAnd if your son will have a meltdown if others find out, he is not dealing with it in a healthy way.\n\nI really don't understand why people are so against therapy, and even are offended by others suggesting it. It won't hurt your son, it can only bring positive things, sometimes it acts as prevention as well", "You need therapy and so does Mason. \n\nIf you love him as much as you say you do, please get help for the both of you.", "Therapy will help him come to terms with it. It will help him learn how to accept and work through the big feelings he has, and is going to have, about different things that come up being adopted. Therapy gives people tools on how to handle things and I think it could be really beneficial for your son and possibly you as you seem to reinforce that it's something to be hidden and being different is bad.", "Why? Because other people may hate in your son for being adopted, but that\u2019s no reason to hate himself about it. You can\u2019t control how other people react to your son being adopted. You CAN help your son how he sees himself.", "Not everyone will take too kindly to the harsh reality you just stated.  As an adopted person, I understand precisely what you're saying.  \n\nI also think therapy may well benefit your child, so it is definitely something you may want to consider.", "One of my parents is adopted and has never ever received any therapy to deal with it. Despite coming from a very supportive adoptive family, who had many talks with my parent about their adoption, my parent never got the actual professional help they needed to deal with their own feelings about being adopted. I no longer have a relationship with that parent. The issues bled into everything else and my parent is barely functional. My siblings also have barely functional relationships with that parent.\n\nYour love and support is not a replacement for a qualified professional to help your child through their complex feelings.", ">Therapy isn't going to change that anymore than therapy can change the weather.\n\nThis is a problematic view. Maybe you should go together.", "Therapy is to learn how to cope, so he doesnt have a meltdown every time someone reminds him he is adopted, which, as you said, is going to happen.\nESH teacher overstepped and you are not helping your son navigate life in a healthy way.", "Adoption is trauma, even if you have had him from day one. Therapy is a good idea for anyone who has experienced trauma.", "OP, I trust your assessment Mason doesn't need therapy at this time. As for your \"heartless\" response to the teacher? Anyone in a helping profession understands that our feelings and emotions around a situation need to take a backseat to the needs of the people we serve. Keep on keepin' on.", "I edited the comment to reflect that", "None of that changes the fact it was NOT the teacher's place to assume anything without consent. They crossed a serious line into their family's personal business.", "But thats the point. Teachers should not put themselves in other peoples business like that.", "I know it doesn't change the teacher's actions. Hence why I voted ESH: the teacher was in the wrong. \n\nBut OP is an AH too and the biggest one here, in my opinion. The teacher made a mistake, was confronted about it and apologized to the kid for it. The OP was aggressively rude to her and despite her telling him she felt attacked, refuses to apologize. Furthermore and more important he is refusing his son the professional help that he sorely needs (to manage the negative feelings that have a direct connection with this situation with the teacher) and --this is my opinion-- is directly responsible for his son having those views and feelings in the first place."]}
