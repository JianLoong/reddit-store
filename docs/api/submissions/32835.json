(No hate, also autistic)", "Int is probably rock bottom too, if he can't realize he was blocking the aisle. Judging from his reaction, I'm betting he's a barbarian.", "Had a woman accuse me of hitting her car while doing traffic control. All I did was gently place my hand on it, and said hold a minute.

Usually by the pastries, but not through a main aisle part. Luckily where customers can still have room to grab the items and get by.
