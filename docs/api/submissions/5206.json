I figured she knew what to do and what not to do with it. Up until about a week ago, she was responsible with it aside from a few purchases I called her out on, like $180 jeans, over $100 on makeup another time. \n\nEarlier this week, I was just looking at her purchases and came across a major, major $700 purchase. I immediately called her. She bought herself a designer purse.\n\nHer story went from, \" I didn't realize it was that much until after I bought it\" to, \" It's my one Christmas present\". I told her that, at the very least she should've called me and we could've discussed it.\n\nShe started getting snippy with me, telling me it wasnt fair of me to get mad at her when she has been responsible with the card for the most part. I told her I was cancelling the card, and I did.\n\nWhen I told my siblings and my parents about this, everyone gave me grief.

I work for a Fortune 500 company, and we finalized our summer interns a few months ago.\n\nWith that being said, I\u2019d recommend a merit-based allowance on her own debit card where you can transfer money without it touching your account. \n\nBreakdown the budget or work on it together, so she understands what is for living expenses (ie, gas), and what can be saved for fun purchases (eg, eating out, shopping, movies, etc.). If she wants more than what is available, she can get a job or ask for it for a holiday/birthday gift. \n\nOne of my family members had a savings option that I thought was savvy\u2026.if they invested a gifted amount in stocks (or you could have it as a savings account they can\u2019t use for everyday purchases), they would match 50%. (If I gave them $100 and they put $50 towards their stocks, I\u2019d give them another $50 towards stocks\u2026.so really they would have $150 - $50 spending and $100 in stocks).\n\nI like it because a lot of younger kids live paycheck to paycheck (or really, spending money to spending money), and don\u2019t learn how to save. You could do 25% if you didn\u2019t want to do 50%.", "She for sure is in the wrong and was taking advantage. But I think there are more constructive solutions than just canceling the card.", "she \" has a few leads\" on internships according to her", "If she wants money she can get a job.", "I would press that a little harder. Most of the larger companies I know have already finalized selections and offers. Ours pays $19/hr for the Midwest. There might be some floating around, but they likely are going to be unpaid the longer you look.", "Of course, but as a parent, I don't think it's fair to institute that sort of consequence without it being clearly stated from the beginning.\n\nThis seems like a \"two strikes\" type situation to me: \"You messed up and you know it. Here is what you have to do to make up for it \\[return the purse\\] and here is how you have to operate moving forward \\[stay under a certain limit and/or only make certain categories of purchases\\]; if, from here on out, you violate these rules, your card will be taken away.\"", "starting to regret giving her this much rope"]}
