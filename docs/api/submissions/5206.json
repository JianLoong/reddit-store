I figured she knew what to do and what not to do with it. Up until about a week ago, she was responsible with it aside from a few purchases I called her out on, like $180 jeans, over $100 on makeup another time. \n\nEarlier this week, I was just looking at her purchases and came across a major, major $700 purchase. I immediately called her. She bought herself a designer purse.\n\nHer story went from, \" I didn't realize it was that much until after I bought it\" to, \" It's my one Christmas present\". I told her that, at the very least she should've called me and we could've discussed it.\n\nShe started getting snippy with me, telling me it wasnt fair of me to get mad at her when she has been responsible with the card for the most part. I told her I was cancelling the card, and I did.\n\nWhen I told my siblings and my parents about this, everyone gave me grief.

If she wants more than what is available, she can get a job or ask for it for a holiday/birthday gift. \n\nOne of my family members had a savings option that I thought was savvy\u2026.if they invested a gifted amount in stocks (or you could have it as a savings account they can\u2019t use for everyday purchases), they would match 50%. (If I gave them $100 and they put $50 towards their stocks, I\u2019d give them another $50 towards stocks\u2026.so really they would have $150 - $50 spending and $100 in stocks).\n\nI like it because a lot of younger kids live paycheck to paycheck (or really, spending money to spending money), and don\u2019t learn how to save.
