Me and her have a strained relationship after her mother took her to another state after we broke up. I visited her every month, but unless i initiated it, the text and calls were dry. \n\nWhen i got an invite to the wedding she told me i could walk her down the aisle, and i was elated that she would choose me, because her mom married and she grew up with him. (Me and mom\u2019s husband talked on the phone and he told me its all good so we don\u2019t have any problems ) \n\nAnyways i was not involved in any of the planning just walking her down the aisle and watching the wedding. So when choosing my outfit i went with a cream color as the theme was day at the beach. The cream color was to match a sandy vibe so thats what i went with.\n\nWhen i walked i to the brides dressing room, i asked her how i look and she turn and let out a loud scream. She told me wearing that is gonna ruin her day(she was a huge bridezilla) she told me a day at the beach meant blue and yellow not cream because that was the color of her dress. Even though her dress resembled more white than cream.\n\nShe told me that i\u2019m not gonna be able to walk her down the aisle but i said i can find something to change into but she said there is no time, so I left, and instead she got her Stepdad to walk her down.\n\nWhen she found out i left she and her new husband blew up my phone saying i could have stayed and watched my only child\u2019s wedding.\n\nBut i think if she didn\u2019t want me to walk her down the aisle then she didn\u2019t want me there", "created_utc": 1696193541, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xcigx/aita_for_leaving_my_daughters_wedding/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And she definitely handled it poorly. \n\n But so did you. You just left without saying a word. \n\nAlso, of course you were the one to initiate contact. It\u2019s called parenting.
