We all live in the American South, and are luckily going to be able to swing both this year. Cammie and I have been together for a year and have lived together for a while. Cammie's family has always been really supportive of our relationship and has openly welcomed me into the family. My family...has tried. Growing up, my family was very anti-LGBT, and though they've done a lot of work, there's been a lot of targeting and comments (my dad got me a shirt that said \"Lesbians Eat What?\" with a meme cat-face on it that made me super uncomfortable). You get the idea.\n\nFor Thanksgiving, we're going to be visiting with extended family of mine that I haven't been able to see since pre-covid. I'm really excited because we're also going to be announcing our engagement (my parents and siblings already know, but I have a BIG family).\n\nSince getting together, my mother has instated a rule that Cammie and I are not allowed to share a bed. This works for one-two night weekend trips where we spend someone's birthday at home (my family lives an hour away, Cammie's family lives four). I want to spend as much time as I can with my family and Cammie, especially because we're going to be getting married in a few years, but the \"no shared beds/rooms\" thing really makes us both uncomfortable, especially the first time we did it.\n\nSo, I plan on staying with my aunt (who is very cool) for this vacation. My mother is planning on staying in a different house, but she's still insisting that we sleep in separate beds and rooms. I'm an adult and I can sleep in bed with whoever I want, but she doesn't seem to understand that. We got in a blowout fight on the phone today about it, because Cammie is very uncomfortable with the idea of sleeping alone in a brand new place, and I would feel terrible if I had to sleep in a new place alone. I tried to compromise by saying we could sleep in the same room with different beds, but she won't budge. I've been considering just lying and going with it while sleeping in the same bed as Cammie, as my aunt would likely have no issues with it. Like, I literally just want to *sleep* in the same bed as her, is that so crazy? Would I be the asshole if I slept in the same bed as my fiancee?", "created_utc": 1667334640, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjke6v/wibta_if_i_slept_in_the_same_bed_as_my_fiancee/", "score": 12, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like, does your mom think you live together but don't sleep together or something? \n\nOtherwise, I can sorta understand the \"my house my rules\" but if it's not even in her house... is she just scandalized \"on behalf\" of your aunt?

Or maybe your Aunt told your mom she's uncomfortable with the idea and asked her to talk to you? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f It might be a good idea to talk to your aunt, if you feel comfortable enough to have a really candid convo about this with her. Then maybe if your aunt is OK with it, you could just ask your aunt to talk to your mom about this for you. Maybe your aunt can help your mom come around to the idea?\n\nOr could you just get a hotel, or would that be even more scandalous to your mom? Or is that not an option financially?\n\nHonestly my husband and I have *always* gotten a hotel when visiting my parents despite there being enough beds/room. My parents knew we were sleeping together by the time we first visited, so that wasn't an issue with them. Sometimes it's just about having somewhere to \"retreat\" to for peace and quiet during the holidays.", "NTA\n\nI have absolutely no idea why you're allowing your mother to even be a part of the conversation.

Normally I'd say don't lie about it, but your mom may WANT you to lie about it. It's messed up and backwards and stupid, but it is how it is.\n\nWeirdly, I'm remembering once in college where I visited my girlfriend at her mom's place.   I had to sleep on the couch, but then her mom paid for us to have a hotel room one night. It wasn't that she was trying to keep us from having sex, she just didn't want it under her roof.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
