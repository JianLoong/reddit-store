But now you need to decide if you want to go for a divorce/annulment or try working it out (in which case, it's time for couples counseling). IMO his sentiment \"I did coke in front of the kids, leaving them without supervision, *and you better be okay with that*\", is something I'd be documenting, telling to a lawyer, and be running from. That's really, really scary. That's a man who gambles away all your money without talking about it first and shrugging when your house and car get repo'd. That's a man who is okay with threatening you.

I\u2019m not seeing a good reason for staying married. Doing c0ke in your home, and kids were home, worth divorce. Vanished from the wedding for a couple hours to get high with his buddies, worth divorce. His comment that he\u2019s thrown women out for criticizing his drug use\u2026 certainly not a good sign. You say he has been clean for 3 years, no. He has maybe (and probably not) been clean for 4-5 months. You aren\u2019t clean if you do \u201cjust a bit of c0ke\u201d.

NTA for the situation described.", "NTA - It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned about your children's safety, and it's illegal to use or possess cocaine, so it's unclear why your husband would engage in such behavior, especially with children around.

He definitely should not have had drugs around the house when you have kids that live there \u2014 regardless if they were home or not at the time. Any evidence or residual puts your kids at risk, whether they accidentally consume it or if something were to happen and the police found it. If he was once addicted, even partaking once can send him into a relapse. And he shouldn\u2019t be dismissive of you bringing it up.

I knew two women that didn\u2019t even use drugs, but their husbands were heavy users. One kicked him out, got a divorce, and got her kids back. One insisted he needed her and if she left him then what would happen if he overdosed? Last I heard rights were terminated.

Yikes.\n\nPlus he warns you that if you try to discuss his addiction, he might kick you out, as he's done with previous women.\n\nIf what's bothering you is the one night of cocaine in the house with the children, that's bad enough.

Instead he threatened to kick you out??!?!?!! Honestly that would be my actual point of no return, when he can't even acknowledge it's wrong.\n\nThe other thing that is compared to everything minor but still noteworthy is how the wedding went down?! Maybe that depends on how important this event is to both of you but just leaving for two hours and making the bride cry seems terrible to me. And you write it went as good as you could hope? Like that's quite far from what I hope for a wedding. \n\nAnd again how he doubles down on this shows he's not willing to improve. Also that he's pissed you don't have sex with him after this shit show rubs me the wrong way.
