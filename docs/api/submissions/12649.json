Do you have a time machine he can use?", "That's my thought I smoke both cigs and weed at most it should take 10 or 15 minutes for a joint then cig, maybe 20 to 30 minutes if it's a special occasion and your bullshiting with friends", "Exactly!", "Coke yes, weed no. Let's not add misinformation.\n\nStill doesn't mean it should be in home etc. OP is clearly NTA", "It is COMPLETELY unlikely he just happend to start that behavior at the wedding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe likely accepted it for aLL their relationship, and expected him to magically change at the wedding without even discussing it.", "Lol holy shit, clean for 3 years. \n\n\"I've been vegan for 3 years but I had steak the other night and a few slim jims on my wedding night and maybe a glass of milk every now and then\"", "His plan to me was to drink and play video games with his boys. In my mind it was going to be super tame and easy to manage. I was on the other side of the house with my bridesmaids doing last minute stuff for the next day and the children were upstairs asleep.

They will remove your children for this. You not being there wouldn\u2019t help. You left them with someone who you knew was having a party.\n\nI suggest you start planning an exit. And where to get therapy", "So you married him for his money, and ignored the drug use as long as you could?", "It's actually extremely common for abusive partners to maintain a facade until they feel they have their partner trapped, so it's not unlikely he didn't do anything like this before they were married. He hid the coke situation until after vows were said. He got her committed then dropped bombs of trampled boundaries - now there's pressure for her to stay and make it work cause they just made commitments, and if she doesn't leave she's effectively giving him permission to cross those same boundaries again in the future and escalate. In his mind at least. \n\nOP NTA but please get yourself and your kids away from this guy. He's just shown you who he is, willing to trample safety boundaries for your children and unwilling to take any accountability for it. Your responsibility as a parent to protect your children is much greater than any responsibility you have to this relationship. Get out", "He told her after the wedding. A lot of manipulative people keep stuff hidden til they feel they trapped their partner in some way.", "Yeah they\u2019d for sure be in for a bad time if they ingest it, but ultimately should be ok.", "OP, it can be easy to go with the flow, want to be the cool girl, and not see the red flags of a drug using partner. \n\nBut this is really serious. His drug use resulted in your wedding day being embarrassing and sad for you, a day that ended in a fight that kept you apart for the night. That is a Big F\u2019n Deal. \n\nPeople who rely on drugs can\u2019t see how their behavior harms them and others. All these statements about you making a big deal out of nothing are causing you to question your sanity. You wouldn\u2019t be turning to Reddit if you didn\u2019t feel like something is wrong in this picture. Your instincts are right. \n\nPlease seek assistance IRL.  Try  some Nar-Anon meetings. Listen carefully and see if what you hear matches your experience of being told you are wrong for being upset your wedding day was ruined. \n\nIt\u2019s a hard and painful thing to see.  But more importantly, no kids can be safely raised around drug addicts. The addict creates chaos and confusion, which the kids bear the burden of.", "You can get a marriage annulled within 6 months. Gather some evidence of drug use and get a lawyer.", "NTA\nHe left his own wedding reception for TWO hours? That alone would have me questioning my decision, never mind the other stuff", "NTA, that was information that would have been helpful to have before you had kids and got married.\n\nand WTF with leaving your own wedding to get high for 2 hours WTF.", "NTA Get rid of him. He could cause you to lose custody and he\u2019s made it clear his drug use is most important.", "NTA. Sounds like he needs to go back to nursery school to learn to be a decent person. He says he has kicked to the curb any woman that has criticized his drug use. Really. Run as fast as you can", "> \u2026we did not consummate our marriage that night\n\nI mean, you had kids together before the wedding. I think the consummation ship has already sailed. Still, NTA about this issue.", "Yep, that's it. You waited too long to bring it up, so your feelings around this are unfair, invalid, irrelevant, and basically abusive. \n\nYou have no business setting limits on illegal drug use in your home while your children are present. He's obviously a good, responsible father because he's aware he could have used a lot more cocaine that night and didn't. \n\nAlso, you expect him to be present and in attendance at his own wedding?? The audacity. \n\nYou're going to have to get real good at learning your place as a wife real quick if this is ever going to work. \n\n/s", "Nta. Take your children and leave. That should have been clear the day you married him and he ditched for 2 hours to use drugs, then told you he brought hard drugs into your house with your kids.", "NTA.", "NTA. He has made it clear drugs are more important than any woman or kids. Staying with him is not safe for your kids.", "Honey he left his own wedding TO YOU to do weed- I doubt that\u2019s all that he did. I would file an annulment.", "WTH wouldn\u2019t you immediately get the marriage annulled the next day? He loves drugs more than you or your children. He left your wedding reception & abandoned you to get high. And no you should NOT be okay with him doing coke with the kids in the house. Divorce him & do better if not for you, then for your kids. YTA if you stay with him.", "NTA lawyer up", "NTA. I would not be allowing a man who did coke round my kids in my home. \n\nAlso I would not be in a relationship with someone who thought that coming to our wedding on a come down to as appropriate, that snuck off for two hours to do weed, or that ran the power play of telling me we\u2019re married now so suck it up, or I\u2019ll leave. \n\nNone of this seems healthy.", "I think the bigger issue is him leaving your wedding reception for several hours to smoke weed. That clearly shows how much he values drugs.", "NTA. Anyone who would leave their own wedding reception for 2 hours to go home and do coke is an addict, pure and simple. It isn't just his behavior on the day of the wedding that will endanger your children, OP. There probably has been - and will be - more.", "NTA. This guy sounds a lot like my first husband. He left me in our honeymoon suite to go smoke weed with his brothers and then told me he had cheated on me two days after our wedding. The marriage lasted less than a year for a multitude of reasons, but the red flags you shared show me that yours should probably end in the same fashion. Cocaine around children is unacceptable. Run, don\u2019t walk, out of there.", "YTA - his body, his choice. You don\u2019t get to decide what drugs people ingest until it starts affecting you.", "So he basically told you that he's going to be doing coke and if you have a problem with it he'll kick you out. You should beat him to the punch. As others have suggested, get some counseling on dealing with a spouse with a drug addiction.", "NTA. I understand that it will be hard to leave him, but otherwise you are risking your children's safety and there is a definite possibility of them being removed from your care. If anything, you should be angrier that he has put you and your children in this precarious situation. You are married to a drug addict. Find a divorce lawyer, file the papers, and sue for custody on the basis that he's a drug addict.", "NTA I second the going to Alanon!", "NTA. This is divorce territory for me. You had children in the home and he was under the influence of hard drugs. Not to mention he left you on your wedding night to be with the boys.", "Ew. \ud83e\udd2e\n\nNta. But you are for staying another 6 months and allowing your kids around him.", "This marriage is totally going the distance.", "ugh, NTA but you need to consider this marriage. The way he treated you is unnacceptable and quite a big red flag.", "ESH. You both sound like you're 12. Also, your husband is an abusive shit. He's oblivious to your concerns and doesn't respect you.\n\nAnnulments are cheap, divorces with kids are expensive..", "I think YTA for marrying this guy.  Cocaine aside, who the hell leaves their own wedding reception for two hours?!?!?!\n\nSadly, you should expect a lot more sadness and disappointment from this guy.", "NTA divorce or you\u2019re TA for knowingly endangering your kids.", "All I see is red flags EVERYWHERE. I'm sorry you had children with him. I don't understand why you marry him since he left the reception for TWO hours.\n\nHe also were angry that you did had sex that night\nHe also admitted to consume coke at this bachelor party\nAnd 6 months later he said he kicked out women for CRITICITING his drug use. Like, they were probably correct. And the house you live belong to you too, he cant kick you out.\n\nBut you should leave him ASAP. He is an AH, addict, lame partner and not a good man in general. You don't want your children near him growing up thinking daddy is a good example of man\n\nNTA in this situation, but i think you are a bit of Y T A for having children and MARRYING this guy. Run fast and far\n\nEDIT: typo", "OMFG call the cops already.", "NTA, HE BROUGHT COKE INTO UR HOME WHERE THERES KIDS! What if one of them seen them take it or touched it??? That shit could mess a kid up if not kill them!!! \nDivorce this man, for ur child's safety divorce him.  \nHe didn't kick his habit, someone who thinks doing \"a little bit\" in a house with kids is ok he didnt kick the habit. His friends are no better for bringing it.", "I would much prefer that my partner partake in drugs for the bachelor party rather than cheating on me, but that\u2019s just me. I\u2019d be happy if that was all that happened. \n\nBut, NTA bcs it\u2019s understandable that you wouldn\u2019t want drugs around your kids/family.", "I rarely comment this word, but it's the best here...

Pretty sure he was lying but I didn\u2019t see indication of her accepting it.", "Wtf?", "Someone who hasn't used in 5-6 years who used once at a bachelor party is not an addict.", "I agree he\u2019s the asshole here for telling her that she has to be okay with any past drug-use or what seems to be potential future use. But to say he\u2019s an addict based off this information alone is a reach.", "He went home during the wedding to coke, not weed.", "You do realise he almost certainly was doing coke at home on your wedding day too, right? He was testing you out with his \"confession\" and the fact he's basically threatening you because you aren't ok with his one time drug use, and also is citing his previous drug using history as justification for it being ok, is probably a sign this isn't a one time thing and he's regularly using. \n\nYou would be an AH if you remained in this marriage with children around this man.", "I think most realistic people understand that it takes some time to formulate an escape plan, especially when you\u2019re financially dependent.", "If he's hanging out with people he did drugs with, and they continue to bring it around him, he's not clean, not sober and going to get your kids taken away.", "You are not crazy. \n\nBut you will be crazy if you stay with him.

The statement he dumped women \u2264~~~multiple term here for getting on him about his drug use makes it clear as day he's an addict!!!!!", "That\u2019s not what OP has said here.", "Oh, I didn\u2019t realise", "Also, why would he actually go home to smoke weed instead of just going outside? Even if they live somewhere that it's illegal, it can't be that hard to find a secluded alley or something and rejoin the party before anyone even notices he's gone", "Was perhaps.  But an addict doesn't stop using for 6 years.", "We\u2019ll agree to disagree. Someone who is totally anti-drug is going to call out any drug use whatsoever, even recreational use. What you\u2019ve stated is not in itself indicative that he\u2019s an addict, could be that he\u2019s had women in the past who wouldn\u2019t tolerate any use at all, while he only uses recreationally.\n\nI\u2019d inform yourself a bit more.", "I know. But I also know a ton of addicts.", "Not easy to leave is different than \u201cmy kids suffered because I waited too long. \u201c", "Do you not earn your own money?", "You're just as reckless. Having a kid without the protection of government sanctioned marriage and your own financial security is reckless. And you did it MORE THAN ONCE.\n\nEither forgive him or move on and get your self together, but make better choices.", "As do I, you still shouldn\u2019t be making baseless assumptions like that. There\u2019s nothing to suggest he\u2019s an addict. An asshole, sure.

If she thinks she's mad over 1 time wait untill he goes full blown before rock bottom!", "I\u2019m not going to reply direct to OP because I don\u2019t want to pile on but this is why I am so astonished women are still entering SAHM relationships with unstable partners and WITHOUT LEGAL PROTECTIONS! Anyone under 20 reading this - it\u2019s not as glamorous as tiktok makes it look. Please make your own money before settling down with anyone or ffs having kids :(", "I'm a sahm, I wish I could earn my own money but childcare is so expensive I'd be working to pay for day care and not be able to save any of it.", "This whole posts suggests he\u2019s an addict. Cocaine isn\u2019t the same as weed. You don\u2019t just use it for years and not become addicted.", "But why doesn\u2019t his income go towards childcare as well? Every abusive relationship starts exactly like yours - married with kids and no money of your own. Please open your eyes and get some support before it\u2019s too late.", "While that does make it harder if you\u2019re legally married now and they\u2019re his children, you can still get child support and alimony in the divorce. No judge is going to deem him a fit father if he brought coke around the kids Do you have a support system that can help you and the kids until a divorce would be finalized?\n\nTo be honest if you don\u2019t pursue divorce you are the asshole for continually risking your kids.", "Is it worth being married to a man you don\u2019t like and can\u2019t trust?", "No it doesn\u2019t? You\u2019re very misinformed if you think there\u2019s no middle-ground between zero drug use and being an addict. Even cocaine can be used recreationally without becoming an addict.

I used if off and on for years, and at one point maybe 6 or 7 years ago was the last time I did, not through any decision, it's just the last time I used it and I haven't really thought about it since then. \n\nThinking about it now, I wouldn't be against having some in the right situation, but I have no strong desire to. I also don't think it's possible to do it ethically right now since, unlike marijuana for example, it's mostly sourced from criminal cartels and I can't support that."]}
