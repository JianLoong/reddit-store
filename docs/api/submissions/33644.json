To put it simply, Ella tortures Finn. Finn can't open his mouth around her without her getting angry. She makes fun of his hair (he wears it long), his clothes, his hobbies, his friends. For example, I mentioned I was thinking of taking on extra work, Finn said thats a good idea because my rent has gone up. Ella responded \"since when do you have a finance degree\" even if, frankly, he was right. He tripped up the stairs last night, she told to stop pretending to be drunk (he was drinking with his friends downstairs). Ella seems to think its all a joke, but it upsets Finn. Finn asked if we wanted to watch a movie tonight and suggested one he likes, Ella responded \"not everything is about you\". Finn wore a t-shirt of a band he likes, Ella complained he doesn't even listen to them. And on and on it went.\n\nYesterday, we went to a little coffee place. The usual \u201cjoke\u201d arguments happened all the way there. The trouble started when Finn accidentally knocked the table, and Ella exploded, saying \u201cthere\u2019s hot drinks on this table, would you be careful\u201d and then yelling some more when Finn said it was an accident. I tried to defuse it and told Ella to stop, she replied \u201cYou need to learn to take a joke\u201d. When I told her she was taking it too far, Ella kept on complaining. She gave us the silent treatment, even when Finn asked about her plans, and when she gave a blunt answer, turned to me and said \u201csorry did I take that too far again?\u201d. I told her yes, and she started yelling at us again about how we gang up on her (we don\u2019t).\n\nHere\u2019s the issue; during the commotion, Finn made a remark about Ella\u2019s friends (I didn\u2019t hear this, but Ella was very upset and Finn admitted he said it). Last year, some really bad shit went down between Ella and her friends that really upset her, so he touched a nerve. Knowingly or unknowingly.\n\nAnd I was sympathetic, as from what I saw happened, it was *bad* bad and it messed her up. And Finn apologised. But, I was on Finn\u2019s side, because Ella had ripped into him non-stop. So Ella was yelling at Finn, and our mum was telling the both of them to make up, I stepped in remembering all the crap Ella pulled, and said \u201cElla shouldn\u2019t dish it if she can\u2019t take it\u201d.  \nAnd yes, it was harsh and I shouldn\u2019t have said it. But I felt like someone needed to put Ella in her place, because all she did until then was whine about me \u201cbabying\u201d Finn and Finn\u2019s inability to \u201ctake a joke\u201d. Ella stormed off crying, My mum told me it wasn\u2019t my place to tell her as I\u2019m only seeing part of what\u2019s going on-apparently they\u2019ve been at each other since she got back. And maybe that\u2019s true but all I see, even before I moved out, was her antagonizing him and him giving her more grace than she deserved.  \nNow, Ella is not talking to me. My mum is insisting I stay out of it and we all make up for Christmas.  \n\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1703357876, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18pcdqb/aita_for_telling_my_sister_dont_dish_it_if_you/", "score": 4721, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There is a chemical reason people do this. Their brains are miswired and where most people's brains only receive chemical rewards for positive behavior, Ella's brain is producing a little hit of dopamine in her brain to reward her being powerful and in control. When she sees that she's hurting Finn's feelings, she feels as if she's winning. \n\nPeople with narcissistic personality disorder are themselves the victims of their brains not working properly. It is not her fault, per se, that her brain is rewarding bad behavior. If this is Ella's problem (which only a professional who has met with her can properly diagnose), do not have much hope for her ever changing, or even wanting to. It is difficult for narcissists to even admit that they've done anything wrong because the chemicals in their brains are telling them the opposite.\n\nHelp Finn learn what grey rocking is. The other advice I would give is to look for and try to break patterns in Ella's behavior before they get too bad. The worse the patterns get, the worse she'll respond when someone finally does say something.\n\nLearn more about \"reactive abuse\". It sounds like that is what Finn did during whatever that commotion was. Understand that narcissists learn quickly to use people's poor responses to their own bad behavior against their victims. It is narcissism 101 and based on what you've reported, my guess is that Ella did something much worse to which Finn was responding.\n\nChances are good that at least one of your parents are also narcissistic else they wouldn't be allowing Ella to get away with her bad behavior.\n\nUnderstand that narcissists often only turn to negative behavior when they aren't getting enough dopamine in more positive ways. If Ella were receiving compliments and praise and already had her dopamine fix, she probably wouldn't be picking on Finn so much. But like any drug, they'll always want more, so they'll always end up going negative. \n\nHelp Finn learn to recognize and understand gaslighting techniques so that he is less likely to internalize the damage they can do. The brain does this thing where, if something is repeated enough times, we start to believe it, even if we know intellectually that it isn't true. His sister is consistently telling him he is stupid and worthless. That is going to have an effect.\n\nAnd lastly, make sure to tell Finn that you're there for him and he can call you or text you any time about anything.", "Why was a 17 year old drinking with his friends.

I could blast it as loud as I could and drown her out. If she tried to rip/knock my headphones off, I had the excuse of self defense. Otherwise, I couldn't stand up for myself. If I did, we'd both get yelled at, but mostly me. I was older, so I should have been able to take it better. Except it started when she was 4 or 5 and only got worse as we got older. And by worse I mean she'd openly tell me that nobody loved me and that everyone would be happier if I died or didn't exist. She never said that in front of my parents though. She'd save that for when they weren't listening. When they were, it was always \"just a joke.\"\n\nYou standing up for Finn is what I needed growing up.

Underage drinking is fairly relaxed here in a family environment, it is illegal for under 18s to purchase alcohol but it is completely legal for someone to give their child alcohol in their own home as long as they are over 6 (to be clear no responsible parent is giving their 6 year old alcohol and if a 6 year was, in reality regularly drinking social services would be involved, it is just set low to decriminalize incidents where a kid might sneak a sip of a parent's wine or something). \n\nHowever, teenagers having a small amount of alcohol at family events is fairly normal. I've been allowed a cider at bbqs and wine with sunday dinner since I was around 14. At that age you a probably talking about being allowed one drink (maybe 2 if something low in alcohol and a special occassion) and then expected to switch to soft drinks, and this would not be a regular thing, but they would usually be allowed some. And for a 17 year old, they would probably be allowed more. A lot of British parents figure a kids first exposure to alcohol should be a controlled environment and when I went to university at 18 you could tell who had the strict parents because they were the ones who were going out of control. The one's who were allowed some alcohol as a teenager were a lot chiller.", "Of course, you're American...", "1. Why are you bringing up my trauma?? How irrelevant.\n2.
