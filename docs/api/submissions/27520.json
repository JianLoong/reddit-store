You're allowed to have things that are yours. How long have you been with your boyfriend, how long were you with him before you met the kids and how long before you moved in? It wouldn't surprise me if he wanted help with the kids more than he wanted an actual romantic partner.\n\nETA: If he's giving his kids the expectation that people are required to share with them, I wouldn't be surprised if they grow up to be spoiled, entitled monsters.

You don't \"have to share\" with kids, yours or not.

You should not have to share you gaming devices with your BF's kids.\n\nThat being said, you will have to, at some point. When you enter a relationship with kids in it, they automatically get priority, and sooner or later, you'll be stamped \"selfish and heartless\" for \"breaking poor kids' hearts\".\n\nI didn't even let one of sister's friends stay with me temporarily (couple of months) because she has a kid, and I have exams upcoming- so I need the peace, and while she believes her kid is very well behaved, any problem and the kid will have priority, even in my own house\n\nTo be honest, the only support you got on reddit is because you are a woman who moved in with her BF.

I think it's great that you're willing to share your Switch and Xbox, and that you're setting limits on the kids when they abuse your stuff.\n\nBut there are things that I don't let my own biological kid touch, one of them being my computer. That's normal, and there's nothing wrong with it.", "NTA", "NTA. Kids need to learn that not everything is for them and he as a father needs to teach him that. There are boundaries in life. They are not entitled to your things, especially if the items you do, let them use, they do not treat with any respect.", "NTA \n\nDoes he let the children drive his car? Does he let the 5 year old operate the stove by themself?\n\nNo, because they are not mature enough for the responsibility of using it. The same can be said for your gaming PC.", "Nta.  Gawd.  They have plenty to play with.", "My dad had an entire room full of expensive music equipment my entire childhood that I was simply not allowed to be in unless invited basically. I survived just fine just like literally all kids do with boundaries like this. It\u2019s normal. NTA.", "NTA. Please password protect your pc immediately. Tell your boyfriend that you\u2019re allowed to have something special for yourself and that you already share everything else. The kids and your boyfriend need to learn boundaries. If he doesn\u2019t listen to you and argues, just pack up and go. Honestly, 3 kids (at those ages too) is a ton of baggage\u2026you can do better and find someone who respects you and your boundaries without all of the drama/stress.", "NTA  if was him with the gaming stuff would he share?  With yours or even his own,?  Doubt it.   Give him the monetary figures of what they are allowed to use and what they aren't.  See if he's willing to pay up if they stuff up.", "NTA. draw the line now or regret it", "NTA. You\u2019re allowed to have boundaries and your own things. They are not entitled to your stuff. If he can\u2019t respect that then move out.", "NTA.\n\nMove out again. You do not want to be entangled with someone who doesn't accept that there can be boundaries with children and things that they don't get to have.", "Yeah, but in your scenario he would have to put some actual effort in and parent his kids. It would just be waaaay easier for him if OP just give in to them", "Do be fair, stepmothers are so hated on this sub. Whatever they do, they get hate.", "I\u2019m a parent. NTA. Even my own kids ain\u2019t allowed to touch all my things lol kids need to learn not everything is a toy", "NTA kids need to learn that not everything is theirs or they can use. Your being more than generous sharing the 2 systems you are especially after the throwing of the paddles.", "NTA. We have this exact set up with our (biological) children - the xbox is fair game but computers are personal. You absolutely do not have to share everything with kids.", "NTA, I have kid that are my own and am also a gamer, we have consoles they can use and ones that are just mine. The 2 older ones can use mine but with their own controllers and the younger ones can only use them if co-op with me so I make sure they look after it. It's perfectly fine to protect your stuff.", "Nta - you don\u2019t HAVE to share, not even with kids. Children have to learn that sometimes they don\u2019t get what they want and you spent a lot of money on your pc and they don\u2019t have any respect for other people\u2019s things.", "NTA. Even bio parents don't share everything with their children. You are certainly allowed to have some adult only things of your own and you already share your other gaming systems.", "NTA. I have a child I grew in my own body and she's not allowed to use everything I own. It's called boundaries, and everyone is allowed to have them. They are healthy for children to learn, both from example and in practice. By teaching children to respect other people's things, you are also teaching them that their things are worthy of respect. Your bf is a lazy parent, so good luck with that.", "NTA. I don\u2019t even share my tech with the kids I birthed. I don\u2019t like to share so I came up with a solution. I bought them their own stuff. Everyone has their own gaming systems and PCs in my house. People can assume my kids are spoiled but in reality mom just doesn\u2019t like to share. Your bf can buy a pc and systems for the kids.", "No. NTA. \n\nAs a mother of a blended family, your bf is batshit, and very wrong.\n\nMy partner has his computer, his music gear etc. My son (his stepson) was not allowed to touch any of it without express permission and close supervision. Now, fifteen years later, he still has his gear, and his (ours) *own* son doesn't touch without express permission and close supervision. \n\nAs adult, as parents, it's out job to teach our children to human. Part of that is boundaries. Hold your boundaries strong.", "NTA. I dont share my computer either.", "NTA. Being in a relationship with someone who has kids has a ton of challenges, and you're going to end up very uncomfortable and resentful if you two don't talk about and agree on some boundaries. You're sharing a home with a family, but you are allowed to have some things that are just yours. If you don't, you're going to end up feeling run over and not truly at home when you're home. It sounds like you share plenty with them. You're allowed some things to yourself.", "NTA. I\u2019m the person with kids, and this comes down to your boyfriend parenting them properly so they know to respect other people\u2019s belongings. My husband had no kids of his own, and he\u2019s happy to share everything with ours, but I insist that they are respectful and never, ever use anything without asking. \n\nNTA at all, OP.", "NTA. Sounds like you need to enforce boundaries with him and the kids. Put away the switch and lock up the Xbox. If he cares about his kids AND YOU he will figure out how to parent them and teach them how to respect other\u2019s belongings.", "NTA I would tell him he needs to pay it in full it's his to give  the kids and you get a completly new one NO ONE BUT YOU TOUCHES.\n\nOp I would get some furniture that locks and put your computer inside and lock it when you aren't home just in case.and of course your bf doe NOT get a key", "NTA\n\nI agree with this \n\nI have 3 children (teenagers) who I happily share most of my stuff with, but I wouldn\u2019t let them have access to a special \u00a32k gaming system! A) They\u2019d never do any homework b) it\u2019d be mine and  clearly is  expensive c) even as their biological mum with full residency I\u2019m still allowed things that are mine and mine alone!!! \n\nThere\u2019s an expensive ceramic frying pan in my cupboard that no one but me is allowed to use\u2026 They\u2019d ruin it in minutes! I have items in my office and bedroom that they aren\u2019t allowed to touch. I don\u2019t touch their laptop or mobiles as they are allowed things too. \n\nI think your partner is being disingenuous because you are a stepparent / partner. Even parents themselves are allowed their own  things !! \n\nPut a password in that computer that only you know", "Do this and do not give access to your BF, no matter how much he whines or how mad he gets. Given his attitude, you can bet he'll let the kids on it as soon as your back is turned.", "You are so right. I fully expected to see YTA and was pleasantly surprised to see NTA, then I realized, OP is a woman, of course they are on her side. \n\nRegardless of gender, I am on your side. The gaming stuff they are playing with is not cheap and they have proven they don't know how to care for it. No way should they or your BF be allowed access to your new gaming computer."]}
