You sound like the most mature person out of the lot.", "NTA- if anything you are the mature one for being able to go though life dealing with stress in healthy ways as to not let it affect your work performance.\n\nJust try to make sure you care-free attitude does not come off as lazy to your colleagues. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m jealous of you haha.

I like your attitude, personally, and I try to be like that as well. It's a lot more relaxing and keeps me sane.", "NTA - YOU have the most mature way of dealing with life, not them.  My thought has always been, if you really have to complain about work everyday, FIND A NEW JOB.", "Hm, I do have a hard time understanding other people's side of things. Perhaps I should look at it from their perspective sometimes."]}
