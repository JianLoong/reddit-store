Both him and sister are acting like petty children at this point.", "ESH. She falsely accused your husband of cheating on you.

Ask sis if she thinks an apology wrung out of hubby is worth the air it takes to utter it.  Make it clear to both you won't get caught in the middle.", "More info needed.

Your husband should have been gracious enough to accept it (and remain civil thereafter even if he wasn't going to like her again). \n* Your husband didn't need to act out in this way.
