Not a good idea.", "My point exactly!", "Adding fuel to this helps exactly how?  Hubby and sis are both AHs.", "I understand and I agree. I don\u2019t think simply \u201cwalk away. Not my problem\u201d is the answer. \n\nAfter reading OP\u2019s comment on the story behind it, I don\u2019t think she should choose a side per say but she should tell her sister \u201cYou falsely accused my husband of cheating on me and spread it to the family causing drama the family didn\u2019t need and you never apologized to him. He had every right to be upset with you and make that comment your your fianc\u00e9. So in order for this to be squashed you need to be a grown up and talk to him and apologize for what you did. Then we can all move on\u201d \n\nInstead of them both using her to talk to the other like a messenger. \n\nThat make sense?", "Why does everyone keep assuming it\u2019s false?  Who knows either way but it could certainly be true.  Infidelity is pretty damn common.", "We don\u2019t have the circumstances for that, and his comment was still rude and uncalled for.", "So what\u2019s the alternative? For OP\u2019s sister and husband to take shots at each other all the time and make family gatherings uncomfortable for everyone?", "The husband acted like a child to the sisters fianc\u00e9. He could\u2019ve been cordial but he decided to be petty. An mature adult would not have done what he did.", "She's never apologised to him directly", "Doubtful. Sounds like she hates op's husband and always will.", "From how I read it (and I could be wrong) I think he was just trying to piss off her sister be saying that, I don't think he's actually keeping her from going but I am curious why she isnt", "I'm impressed that he's usually civil to her. After that I wouldn't want to be in the same room as her, would stop her from seeing her sister, but i would make it clear if they want to meet, not in the house I live in.", "They shouldn't be snide comments. They should be sincere and detailed descriptions of the sister's past unrepentant wrongdoing. The fiance deserves to know what might be in store for him in future.", "Exactly what I was thinking, couldn\u2019t have said it any better", "Where are you sensing resentment between OP and their husband?", "Agreed. OP should show Hubby she has his back and cut that Drama Llama sister out of their life.", "If we're following this hypothetical that he actually was cheating, she very well could have thought the pictures of him kissing his gal friends on the cheek was proof. Unfortunately many believe you shouldn't be affectionate to your friends of the gender you're attracted to", "But the woman who *knows* him, who is married to him and who trusts him doesn't believe he's cheating at all. How odd that you, just based on this little post,  can judge him more accurately than his wife. \n\nThis is just shit stirring done by people with insecurity issues, OP. Don't let it make you doubt your husband.", "Sharing a picture of husband kissing someone on the cheek is hardly proof of adultery. sis did stir shit up and created drama just because she thought she had gone full Veronica mars on the husband for no reason. \n\nIf she had been mistaken because she had seen a kiss and though it was weird, and explained the situation to OP, this would be an honest mistake. \n\nBut she doubled down and shared the picture of the entire family as proof. That\u2019s not an honest mistake. That\u2019s maliciousness.", "Maybe not, but spreading it to all of the family after being told \"no\" by OP seems pretty malicious.", "Um, no?  The sister was mistaken when she first talked to OP about possible cheating. Then when she repeatedly refused to accept OP\u2019s comments she went out to prove it, and when that didn\u2019t work she blasted it to the whole family. \n\nThat isn\u2019t \u201cmistaken\u201d that is vindictive and irrational.", "That is a fantastic way to end an argument. I don\u2019t know how you can keep going after that", "Yeah sounds like sis is a drama mongerer but in that case they should just not spend time with her. Not continue to socialize with her but throw out passive aggressive remarks. It makes everything unpleasant for everyone else there.", "Let's see... \n\nA husband who is never \"home\" but always at work and when he is home, he is always on his phone or laptop. \n\nThen there is a photo Op where the husband is out with another woman in an intimate setting. \n\nIf I saw my BIL being physically affectionate with another woman when my sister wasn't around. (Unless it was a hello/goodbye greeting situation) I would definitely be concerned. Especially if they were obviously comfortable with signs of physical affection.  \n\nIf she simply dismissed my concern,  I would be even more concerned. \n\nBut I would have asked questions. Did you know he was going out with her? Did he tell you about it. Do you know this friend? Is she married? \n\nMaybe I've been on reddit too long. I'm jaded. \n\nYes, the sister acted immaturely by spreading the gossip publicly. But the concerns are not unfounded. \n\nObviously, the pictures were bad enough that the rest of the family was also concerned. Otherwise, there would be no drama. \n\nSometimes, we are so \"blinded by love\" that we don't see the red flags waving. \n\nHonestly, the husband's response that he \"wouldn't let her go dress shopping\" as well as his remarks about the sister at her engagement party make me wonder if she didn't hit a nerve. And seem to indicate he has a controlling nature that doesn't like to be questioned.", "Not only without any basis, but after being repeatedly told to stop trying to interfere because nothing was going on", "Think about it this way. \n\nIf I wrote an Op asking if I was the AH for being suspicious of my husband. \n\nHe says his work is demanding, but he is as work a lot. Almost never home. When he is home, he is always on his laptop or phone and unable to put it down to spend time with me. \n\nI try to be considerate. I know he is a hard worker, and his work is demanding, but others are noticing too now. \n\nRecently, my sister saw him kissing another woman on the cheek. She took a picture. He says it's just a friend. And I've met her before. \n\nI told my sister that doesn't prove anything bit now she showed the photo to the rest of the family. \n\nAITAH for dismissing their concerns?", "I agree with you ESH. \n\nThe sister handled things poorly, but if an OP posted here explaining the \"cheating\" accusations. And her effort to ignore the entire thing, how do you think people would respond? \n\nYes, I think she still suspects him. \n\nI think he resents having to be careful.", "A coincidence. And a sign that I'm spending too much time on Reddit", "Good point - I'm going to say ESH but mainly, massively, the sister.  That being said, the husband should either forgive her or refuse to be around her.  Hanging around her and making shitty comments isn't a good way to behave.", "But the actual details she later shared could be consistent with a mistake, not maliciously making a knowingly false accusation. Sister still shouldn't have over-reacted.m, but it's very different.", "OP says in the post \u201cmy sister falsely accused my husband\u201d so that\u2019s probably why everyone is assuming that. \n\nShe also explains that the incident was when sister lived with them, husband was working a lot and so he wasn\u2019t home a lot and when he was he was on his phone. She didn\u2019t witness anything she just made an assumption. Sister also never apologized.", "I can see your point, but if i had been accused of cheating, and is proven to be untrue, as OP said. I would (no matter how much time had passed) do exactly as he did. She could have destroyed his life, and his marriage, i do not blame him, she may grow from the experience", "It sounds like sis genuinely had suspicions based on hubby frequently being out late and constantly on his phone and computer when home.  She definitely handled it wrong but it does not sound like she was being intentionally malicious and lying.", "Well then, he doesn't owe her an apology.  If she had apologized and he accepted her apology,  then I might call his comment A H territory.  But since she didn't even apologize to him for trying to break up your marriage (cuz that's what she tried to do) then she got what she deserves. NTA for not defending her against your husband but soft y t a for not standing up for him when she complained.  Your new mantra should be \"you reap what you sow.\" Play it on repeat when she complains.", "So she convinced herself of false accusations and then started shit with your whole family over it in a way that damaged your husband's reputation and then never apologized.\n\nWhy do you spend time with her again?", "Well that's your first problem. Did you stand up for him against the family? Did you call your sister out for her BS? Did you kick her out of your house?", "If your sister never apologized to your husband directly for accusing him of cheating on you, then IMO, your husband doesn't owe your sister an apology for anything. Furthermore, I think that your husband's comment to your sister's fiance was warranted/justified.", "So how has it been addressed? It seems like you and your family may have tried to sweep this, huge breach of your husbands privacy and trust, under the rug and your husband was forced to just act like nothing happened. If I were him I\u2019d be pissed at you for not insisting that she apologize, or you don\u2019t go to family events for her like, her engagement party.", "look...if anyone in my family did this, and never even apologized, id go bo contact with that perso. and whoever supports them.", "Until she at least learns to act contrite, she can pound sand.", "Seems like she\u2019s not going because the sister is making the wedding dress shopping the deciding point on who\u2019s side she\u2019s on, if she goes then op has \u201cadmitted\u201d her husband is in the wrong and will shit talk her husband the whole time and probably try to bully op into making their husband apologize. With this much drama is stay out of the wedding entirely tbh", "Totally agree", "This should only be done by someone who desperately wants ALL THE DRAMA though. Otherwise, best just to keep distance from sister and her doings. If it hasn't come up before and only does once they're engaged, that's at least 1.5 Maurys on the Family Drama scale. 2.5 if it's OP or the husband to bring it up.", "This is why the people of Reddit suck. First thing they go to is worst case scenario  everytime . The same people who's first advice is \"break up with hin that's a giant red flag\"", "I'm just not seeing definite maliciousness. It could be over-protectiveness.", "I think it's over-reacting, but I don't think we have enough information to conclude it's malicious.", "I agr\u00e9e, but since OP confirmed further down that sis never apologized to husband, I just gotta hand it to him. It was a grade A, savage insult.\n\nEdit: a word.", "Spin, spin, spin that story until it's one that fits your preferred judgment.", "Yeah i just saw that. Sounds like even tho she was told she didnt have any actual proof of anything she decided to tell the family anyways hoping to break them up.", "I don't blame you for having that reaction/feeling towards the situation. We just handle shit differently.", "Agreed. I think sister is the asshole for making assumptions. That's not fabrication. But the husband stating that when she announced her engagement and forbidding OP from wedding related activities was malicious. And controlling.", "I volunteer as tribute!  Sounds fun.", "The sister is definitely shit. But husband also needs to pick a lane going forward.", "No spin\n\nThe sister saw things that in any other op would be labeled as \"red flags\" in a relationship. \n\nShe handled it poorly. \n\nThe OP blew the entire thing off. Then, when her husband said something offensive, she let it go. Even though she said she was shocked he would say something like that. She even knows ot wasn't appropriate. \n\nThe husband chose to make a stab and twist the knife at the sisters' engagement party. It was completely unnecessary to say that. And what was he warning the fiance of any way that he wouldn't be able to get away with cheating? \n\nThe husband displayed controlling behaviors, saying he wouldn't \"let\" his wife go dress shopping with her sister. \n\nTheir are definitely red flags in her relationship she is refusing to address. \n\nESH", "Kind of depends if they knew that was what the gathering was for. Also, he's not wrong, since the sister seems to confuse cheating with having a job.", "That would be good to know as well.", "Ethically, That\u2019s not an accusation you make without very, very strong evidence", "Op said sis tried to make up evidence of him cheating and then involved  family when that didn't work.", "Yeah, people keep glossing over his weird and antagonistic behaviors and focusing on the sisters allegations.  Just because OP brushed them off doesn\u2019t mean sis was completely off base.  She should have spoken to OP quietly about it and not blasted it to the family.  I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he was cheating based on how controlling he is in this scenario.", "Lol, enjoy! \ud83d\ude06", "Your take is about as solid as diarrhea. \n\nOP/Husband were in full communication. To go behind her back, STALK AND PHOTOGRAPH THE HUSBAND, and blast the entire family shows no class, maturity, or common sense. \n\nDo you see yourself in the sister or something?", "IMO, that doesn't even really matter.\n\nThey still got together ... I wouldn't be going to anything that involved someone I was that mad at.", "But if it's sincerely believed, it's not accurate to call it false.", "I don't think any evidence was fabricated. She didn't understand why he was working so much and why he was kissing a female friend. She was mistaken, but nothing was fabricated.", "LMAO\n\nThe hypocrisy in this sub is hysterical. \n\nI've seen plenty of posts with the same actions as the husband's detailed and get the response of DMFA\n\nI said the sister handled it poorly. And since she is just now getting engaged, we can assume that she was very young and eager when she acted that way. \n\nThe Op is also not giving details besides \"a picture doesn't prove anything\" \n\nIf his actions were so \"innocent\" why the drama?\n\n\"OH that's Suzy, we hang out with her and her partner all they time, she grew up with my husband and is like his sister.\" Is a very easy sentence. No drama.", "He made a single comment at a family event. It's not like he gave the dude a divorce lawyer's card and cash as a wedding gift.", "The problem is that you therefore allow the wrongdoer to further damage him by showing up to family events and then effectively excluding him!  No, if someone has to not show up, it's her, not him, she doesn't get to try to wreck his marriage and then continue to harm him by excluding him from all family gatherings going forward.", "Disagree. At its most basic level(in modern English), False means incorrect. \n\nI\u2019m gonna invoke Godwin\u2019s law here. Should the opinion of a Christian german citizen in the late 1930s that Jews are actively trying to destabilize and prey on the german economy be categorized as anything but false, even if said citizen truly believes in his bigotry?", "You realize Godwin's law isn't a recommendation that you should attempt to prove your point by describing domestic situations by comparing participants to National Socialists, right?", "The point invoking the law is to bypass any potential example based arguments by producing an example so extreme that the basic thrust of said argument can\u2019t credibly be attacked by someone with any moral standing. Which has appeared to have worked, since you failed to actually address the basis of our disagreement"]}
