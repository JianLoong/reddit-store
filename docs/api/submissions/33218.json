There are probably some legal stuff that defines who gets what in the absence of a will, but in general the spouse and kids (if any) are typically the heirs to the deceased individual's estate (read stuff).\n\nYou didn't mention what stuff they wanted you to \"return\" to them, but if there were/are things of intrinsic value in that \"stuff\", I'd probably start pondering about their motivation.  \n\nMy first thought when it comes to people becoming \"horribly disrespectful\" to being told \"no\" is that they are choosing to \"attack\" in the hope that the \"attacks\" will get them what they want/desire.\n\nIf everything is on the up and up, then I would entertain \"sharing\" some of Rose's stuff with them, especially things that are tied to special memories for them that involve Rose.  \n\nThings like photos with them and Rose in them, can be a memento, but cynicism tends to make me wonder why they didn't ask for/get copies of them directly from Rose after the event?  \n\nFor other \"unique\" physical items, I would have to consider them individually, something like a family heirloom, would be something I might consider returning, especially if there were no children to pass them on to, but again, I would have to think about who is going to get the item and if they have someone to pass it on to.\n\nI understand that the diary brings you comfort, but as a lay person, the way that you are using it feel unhealthy.  \n\nHave you asked yourself what Rose would have wanted you to do with your life?  She is gone, and she apparently loved you to bits, do you think that she would want you to be doing the things that you are currently doing?\n\nIt is too bad that you didn't realize what you had until it was gone, but those things that happened in the past cannot be undone, so all you can do is to \"apologize\" to her and then \"forgive\" yourself, and then use your time and energy to become the best version of yourself that you can be, and to live the best life you can, because that's what I think Rose would want/expect from you.\n\nI'm not saying to forget her, because that wouldn't be right, instead keep the good memories, make life lessons from the bad memories, so you don't make the same mistakes/memories in the future.\n\nDon't throw the Diary or other keepsakes away, once you are ready, put them in a proper storage box/container, so that if you need a reminder, you can go and take a look.  You can dispose of them at anytime, but once you do, you cannot undo that action.\n\nPersonally, I think it's kinds of neat to run across something from my past, especially if it was tied to a good time or memory, because the item tends to help bring back the memories and more importantly the \"feelings\" involved, which I use to motivate myself to go to find/make similar memories/feelings in the future.\n\nOne cannot have too many good memories/feelings, bad ones, not so much, I make them useful by using them to build life experiences. \n\nThen use all that to live a long and full life that both you and Rose would be proud of.\n\nI hope this made sense and was helpful.\n\nAgain, sorry for your loss.\n\nBe strong, be safe and be well!", "Sorry for your loss.\n\nDon't make it worse by losing her things too.\n\nIf you want to find middle ground, make copies of everything and give the asshole family the originals \n\nBut for the love of God, do not lose your wife's words.", "NTA\n\nHow she treated you in her diary clearly shows they belong to you.", "NTA, my husband died young too, last summer.

After a few weeks she turned it on and went through it, looking at his call logs and texts. She even logged into his instagram and liked some of my photos (which, mom, that was a little creepy, just saying). She still won't get rid of the phone two years later. She won't wipe it or regift it (even though my family members struggle and could use a newer phone). It's a chronicle of my dad's last days for her, and a connection to his private life, to his inner thoughts. It's like having a conversation with him. \n\nMy wife lost her mother when she was only 21, and I know she wishes she had a chance to know more about her mom and to get glimpses of who her mom was as a person, not just as her mom.

Many of us are in marriages that don't feel like Hollywood or like we think we're supposed to feel when we're in love. Many of us are annoyed by our spouses. Many of us wonder what else there could be for us in the world, if we hadn't chosen a particular path.

You were with her because you knew she deeply cared for you and she knew you loved her, in your own way. And now you are learning you gave her the love she wanted and needed from you; this need to know more about your wife is okay. It's part of the grieving process. I hope your in-laws can come to understand that and respect that.\n\nDon't beat yourself up on finding parts of her grating prior to her passing; people at best of times find each other annoying. Sometimes we go through an off moment and just need some alone space in a relationship, which isn't to say we want to split.

People get a tad bit crazy when someone dies. I dealt with this a couple years ago.  Please set boundaries with her family now and stick with them. Get cameras for your doors.

When my dad died 2 years ago he left so many unanswered questions. I went through hie email, his phone, his notebooks- everything I could think of to try and find the answers. Not once did I feel bad about any of it- I was his next of kin, it was my responsibility to get his affairs in order, and I was very open about this- no one was angry or blamed me for doing this. The most they said was that I might not find the answers I was hoping for.... Which was true. But even others who were grieving my father were not offended or angry. Grief is a funny thing and please give your SIL a pass for now, because she's feeling protective of her late sister and maybe wants to look for her own answers in her possessions.", "\u201cGrief is weird.\u201d Never have truer words been uttered.

I disagree with him refusing to cede any of her items to her also grieving family, and I don\u2019t think realizing your affection for someone after the fact makes up for the way you behaved while they were alive.", "Why does it have to be every single thing though? I never said don\u2019t keep any of it. I said why not give her grieving family some of it?

Stop trying to force meaning into something that was never implied. It is extremely common for ppl not to realize the extent of their feelings until after they were gone. Ppl wouldn\u2019t grieve as deeply if this wasn\u2019t the case. For you to be projecting these feelings onto a recent widower is pretty disgusting. OP said he loved her, and felt he could\u2019ve done better. But everyone is regretful in the face of loss & he could\u2019ve been the perfect husband for her and he wouldn\u2019t know (unless he reads those entries).

But having some negative feelings towards a loved one isn\u2019t that unusual, and we don\u2019t really know emotionally intimate details like that about their relationships with her and their grief.\n\nIt would indeed be a kind and considerate gesture to pass on some mementos to them.\n\nHowever, I would suggest that OP refrain from doing so now because they are browbeating him, and making unjustified accusations, and demanding things of him as he is somehow legally and morally in the wrong to go through a deceased spouse\u2019s personal papers and cherish her possessions. That\u2019s just so inappropriate and cruel. It would be one thing for them to politely ask, but they\u2019re treating him horribly and he shouldn\u2019t just cave to that pressure. He should give himself time process his grief.\n\nI love my brother more than any other human soul, but he has a wife, and if he suddenly died I would never dream of treating his widow this way.

OP seemingly married this woman knowing he wasn't in love with her and felt he was settling. By his own admission he did it because he knew she loved and cherished him. I think that\u2019s really shitty. If you don\u2019t, we\u2019ll have to agree to disagree. \n\nI asked OP if his wife knew how he felt, and he said she did. I could be wrong, but I think her family also probably knew. Just because she chose to accept it or was such a great person that she chose to look past it doesn\u2019t mean they did. It seems like this might be where some of the animosity stems from, and I think they\u2019re entitled to those feelings. OP suddenly chose to feel something for his wife after death; that could easily rankle people.", "Except there's zero evidence at all that OP *was* \"horrible\" to her in any way. He said she was his best friend and that he genuinely loved her. He just didn't think that he was *in* love with her because it wasn't exciting or dangerous like it was with his exes. \n\nHe mistook the comfort and familiarity that comes with aged love as \"settling\" because he didn't realize that love isn't supposed to have sharp edges and doesn't actually have to always give you that fluttery, excited feeling to still be love. \n\nLike yeah, it sucks a lot that he didn't realize the truth until she was gone. But that's not the same as being \"horrible to someone while they're alive\". And shaming him about it now certainly doesn't benefit anybody except yourself, since it seems like you get a real confidence boost out of feeling superior by kicking people when they're down. \n\nYou seem like the type to go out of your way to verbally abuse a cashier for not immediately dropping everything to kiss your feet because it's the only way that you get to feel powerful and in control.", "Most people regret in some form or another aspects of their relationships they had with people they lost. Humans are complicated and close relationships aren\u2019t always smooth sailing. OP never said he treated her badly, simply that he felt annoyed at times, a common phase in marriages for many. \n\nHindsight is 20/20. And when faced with the finality of death most people realise just how silly some of their feelings towards the person they lost were. \n\nLosing someone suddenly takes away to opportunity to have those important conversations. To say thank you, to say sorry, to forgive, to make peace. \n\nMany, many people have lost spouses, parents or children suddenly whilst going through a difficult phase with them. That doesn\u2019t mean they treated the person horribly, it\u2019s just that difficult phases are a normal part of human relationships. We can\u2019t live every day as though we\u2019re about to lose those closest to us, we can\u2019t be perfect and conflict free.", "You are being horrible to people currently alive.", "But we\u2019re not talking about rights.  I said it would be kind to make sure her family has mementos as well.  Can you imagine if your child died and her husband refused to allow you anything to remember her by?", "She chose to marry him and stay married to him. He chose to marry her and stay married to her. That\u2019s a level of commitment that is often not seen even in relationships that start off in a haze of romantic bliss. If he beat the crap out of her or said vile, demeaning things to her, or otherwise isolated or abused her, I would understand their intense animosity, but otherwise, no, it just doesn\u2019t make sense to me. Being annoyed by a spouse that one married while in a haze of romantic bliss is incredibly common. I think love, and indeed \u201ctrue love,\u201d in the context of a multi-year marriage is more messy and complicated than you\u2019re acknowledging here. I don\u2019t think shitting all over someone who has just lost a spouse (unless they\u2019re an outright abuser) is an acceptable course of action.", "That love isn't supposed to have \"sharp edges\" is the most lovely thing I've read in such a long time.", "You think I\u2019m shitting on OP because I asked him questions quoting his own words? Again, we\u2019ll have to agree to disagree, and it\u2019s completely normal for family members to want mementos from their loved ones when they pass. Like I said, OP is (likely) legally allowed to keep all of it. Can\u2019t say for certain since we don\u2019t know where they are located but that\u2019s neither here nor there. I think keeping *everything* is incredibly selfish, and yeah, I absolutely think OP\u2019s spouse deserved better from her husband while she was alive. Not much else to say on my end.", "To be clear, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re shitting on him, but I certainly think his wife\u2019s family is.\n\nThat\u2019s why I would I suggest he take some more time to process her loss before offering them some momentos."]}
