There are probably some legal stuff that defines who gets what in the absence of a will, but in general the spouse and kids (if any) are typically the heirs to the deceased individual's estate (read stuff).\n\nYou didn't mention what stuff they wanted you to \"return\" to them, but if there were/are things of intrinsic value in that \"stuff\", I'd probably start pondering about their motivation.  \n\nMy first thought when it comes to people becoming \"horribly disrespectful\" to being told \"no\" is that they are choosing to \"attack\" in the hope that the \"attacks\" will get them what they want/desire.\n\nIf everything is on the up and up, then I would entertain \"sharing\" some of Rose's stuff with them, especially things that are tied to special memories for them that involve Rose.  \n\nThings like photos with them and Rose in them, can be a memento, but cynicism tends to make me wonder why they didn't ask for/get copies of them directly from Rose after the event?  \n\nFor other \"unique\" physical items, I would have to consider them individually, something like a family heirloom, would be something I might consider returning, especially if there were no children to pass them on to, but again, I would have to think about who is going to get the item and if they have someone to pass it on to.\n\nI understand that the diary brings you comfort, but as a lay person, the way that you are using it feel unhealthy.  \n\nHave you asked yourself what Rose would have wanted you to do with your life?  She is gone, and she apparently loved you to bits, do you think that she would want you to be doing the things that you are currently doing?\n\nIt is too bad that you didn't realize what you had until it was gone, but those things that happened in the past cannot be undone, so all you can do is to \"apologize\" to her and then \"forgive\" yourself, and then use your time and energy to become the best version of yourself that you can be, and to live the best life you can, because that's what I think Rose would want/expect from you.\n\nI'm not saying to forget her, because that wouldn't be right, instead keep the good memories, make life lessons from the bad memories, so you don't make the same mistakes/memories in the future.\n\nDon't throw the Diary or other keepsakes away, once you are ready, put them in a proper storage box/container, so that if you need a reminder, you can go and take a look.  You can dispose of them at anytime, but once you do, you cannot undo that action.\n\nPersonally, I think it's kinds of neat to run across something from my past, especially if it was tied to a good time or memory, because the item tends to help bring back the memories and more importantly the \"feelings\" involved, which I use to motivate myself to go to find/make similar memories/feelings in the future.\n\nOne cannot have too many good memories/feelings, bad ones, not so much, I make them useful by using them to build life experiences. \n\nThen use all that to live a long and full life that both you and Rose would be proud of.\n\nI hope this made sense and was helpful.\n\nAgain, sorry for your loss.\n\nBe strong, be safe and be well!", "Sorry for your loss.\n\nDon't make it worse by losing her things too.\n\nIf you want to find middle ground, make copies of everything and give the asshole family the originals \n\nBut for the love of God, do not lose your wife's words.", "NTA\n\nHow she treated you in her diary clearly shows they belong to you.", "NTA, my husband died young too, last summer.

After a few weeks she turned it on and went through it, looking at his call logs and texts. She even logged into his instagram and liked some of my photos (which, mom, that was a little creepy, just saying). She still won't get rid of the phone two years later. She won't wipe it or regift it (even though my family members struggle and could use a newer phone). It's a chronicle of my dad's last days for her, and a connection to his private life, to his inner thoughts. It's like having a conversation with him. \n\nMy wife lost her mother when she was only 21, and I know she wishes she had a chance to know more about her mom and to get glimpses of who her mom was as a person, not just as her mom.

I see you trying to make sense of the quality of your love for your wife and wondering the extent to which she experienced you as loving her. You're second guessing whether or not you have the right to her innermost thoughts, which is why you're posting here. I think making meaning of your love story with your wife might be helpful. Many of us are in marriages that don't feel like Hollywood or like we think we're supposed to feel when we're in love. Many of us are annoyed by our spouses. Many of us wonder what else there could be for us in the world, if we hadn't chosen a particular path.

You were with her because you knew she deeply cared for you and she knew you loved her, in your own way. And now you are learning you gave her the love she wanted and needed from you; this need to know more about your wife is okay. It's part of the grieving process. I hope your in-laws can come to understand that and respect that.\n\nDon't beat yourself up on finding parts of her grating prior to her passing; people at best of times find each other annoying. Sometimes we go through an off moment and just need some alone space in a relationship, which isn't to say we want to split.
