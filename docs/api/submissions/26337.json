I made it clear to my boys once they started earning money that they would be getting 10 dollars a day for everyday they complete their chore. If they fail to do so, then 10 dollars would be deducted. It has been that way for 2 years for my eldest boys and a couple of months for youngest. Allowance is always paid out every Wednesday, and I encourage them to save enough to take with them on the weekend to their dads in case they go somewhere fun or see something cool that they might want but dad might not be okay with spending money on. This system has worked swimmingly for us since it started, the boys have always complied with completing their chores.\n\nHowever, one of my 12 year olds refused to do his chore of the week (sweeping down stairs and wiping down surfaces) for 3 days. The first 2 days he did so without problem, but when his friend asked him to play on Fortnite with him, my son asked for 15 minutes to complete his chore before he got onto the PlayStation. His friend asked what chore he had to do, so my son told him. In response, my son\u2019s friend said \u201cit\u2019s a good thing my parents don\u2019t make me do girl chores.\u201d I spoke with my son and explained to him that knowing how to clean was not specific to any gender, that it was a life skill everyone needed to know. I also told him that I understood that other family\u2019s functioned differently; however, in our family, everyone did an equal share. Even after speaking with him the first day he decided to not do his chore, he still chose not to do his chores, so like agreed I took 10 dollars out of his allowance for each day he didn\u2019t do, which allotted to him only having 20 dollars in his allowance; whereas his brothers had 50. \n\nThe problem comes where my son was so upset about the lack of money in his allowance that he called his dad about it very upset. My ex husband then proceeded to call me and tell me that I\u2019m in the wrong for only giving him $20 and to imagine how it makes him feel that his brothers got more than he did. I explained to him that our other sons actually did their chores for all 5 days, so they were rewarded accordingly. And assured him that if he had decided to start giving the boys an allowance then he can run allowance however he wanted, but this was ultimately the system I had come up with.

My dad's system was that we had to do our assigned chore's throughout the week. Allowance was 5 dollars a week paid out on Friday, provided we remember to ask for it ourselves *on* Friday, and did not miss any chores. There were a few times I only remembered on Saturday that I forgot to ask on Friday. Those days were valuable lessons. Also, weeks when I forgot to take out the trash on trash night, so even though I remembered to ask on Friday I got nothing, were also valuable lessons.

There's a maximum your kids can EARN by doing daily chores. No work, no pay is not taking away. It's the natural consequence of kid's deciding to skip chores one day. Yeah, he didn't earn the maximum possible. Because he didn't do his assigned chore those days. His sibs EARNED and received the maximum because they did their chores each day.\n\nStick to the boundaries you've set with your kids in your home.

Solution: you give him money so he has the same as his more responsible cooperative sibs. Equal money equals fair. That's such a fallacious argument! Sibs are adhering to the agreement to contribute to the smooth operation of the household and earned their allowance. Lazy boy has not made a similar contribution to the smooth running of the household. His chores are either not done or shifted onto someone else those days. Yet he should still be paid because?  Because he wants the privilege without the responsibility.\n\nYour ex should stay out of decisions you make about your household and your money. It sounds like ex contributes little to the kids learning effective life skills nor funding his outings with them. He's jumped on board with Lazy boy's \"It's not fair sibs have more! I should get the same for existing!\" Conpletely divorcing allowance (privilege and more autonomy) from responsibility (they pitch in time and effort for the household for the benefit of all).\n\nBoth Lazy boy and ex are way off base.
