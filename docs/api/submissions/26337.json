I made it clear to my boys once they started earning money that they would be getting 10 dollars a day for everyday they complete their chore. If they fail to do so, then 10 dollars would be deducted. It has been that way for 2 years for my eldest boys and a couple of months for youngest. Allowance is always paid out every Wednesday, and I encourage them to save enough to take with them on the weekend to their dads in case they go somewhere fun or see something cool that they might want but dad might not be okay with spending money on. This system has worked swimmingly for us since it started, the boys have always complied with completing their chores.\n\nHowever, one of my 12 year olds refused to do his chore of the week (sweeping down stairs and wiping down surfaces) for 3 days. The first 2 days he did so without problem, but when his friend asked him to play on Fortnite with him, my son asked for 15 minutes to complete his chore before he got onto the PlayStation. His friend asked what chore he had to do, so my son told him. In response, my son\u2019s friend said \u201cit\u2019s a good thing my parents don\u2019t make me do girl chores.\u201d I spoke with my son and explained to him that knowing how to clean was not specific to any gender, that it was a life skill everyone needed to know. I also told him that I understood that other family\u2019s functioned differently; however, in our family, everyone did an equal share. Even after speaking with him the first day he decided to not do his chore, he still chose not to do his chores, so like agreed I took 10 dollars out of his allowance for each day he didn\u2019t do, which allotted to him only having 20 dollars in his allowance; whereas his brothers had 50. \n\nThe problem comes where my son was so upset about the lack of money in his allowance that he called his dad about it very upset. My ex husband then proceeded to call me and tell me that I\u2019m in the wrong for only giving him $20 and to imagine how it makes him feel that his brothers got more than he did. I explained to him that our other sons actually did their chores for all 5 days, so they were rewarded accordingly. And assured him that if he had decided to start giving the boys an allowance then he can run allowance however he wanted, but this was ultimately the system I had come up with.

My dad's system was that we had to do our assigned chore's throughout the week. Allowance was 5 dollars a week paid out on Friday, provided we remember to ask for it ourselves *on* Friday, and did not miss any chores. There were a few times I only remembered on Saturday that I forgot to ask on Friday. Those days were valuable lessons. Also, weeks when I forgot to take out the trash on trash night, so even though I remembered to ask on Friday I got nothing, were also valuable lessons.

There's a maximum your kids can EARN by doing daily chores. No work, no pay is not taking away. It's the natural consequence of kid's deciding to skip chores one day. Yeah, he didn't earn the maximum possible. Because he didn't do his assigned chore those days. His sibs EARNED and received the maximum because they did their chores each day.\n\nStick to the boundaries you've set with your kids in your home.

Solution: you give him money so he has the same as his more responsible cooperative sibs. Equal money equals fair. That's such a fallacious argument! Sibs are adhering to the agreement to contribute to the smooth operation of the household and earned their allowance. Lazy boy has not made a similar contribution to the smooth running of the household. His chores are either not done or shifted onto someone else those days. Yet he should still be paid because?  Because he wants the privilege without the responsibility.\n\nYour ex should stay out of decisions you make about your household and your money. It sounds like ex contributes little to the kids learning effective life skills nor funding his outings with them. He's jumped on board with Lazy boy's \"It's not fair sibs have more! I should get the same for existing!\" Conpletely divorcing allowance (privilege and more autonomy) from responsibility (they pitch in time and effort for the household for the benefit of all).\n\nBoth Lazy boy and ex are way off base.

Instead of this son only learning sweeping and wiping and the others not learning those things, all skills would be distributed. Also, switching so that the chores that friends might make fun of are distributed could prevent one son from being particularly singled out and might make him feel like it\u2019s not a girls chore because he constantly sees boys do it.", "Yup. That's LIFE. Honestly 10 bucks a day for an extremely simple chore is far too generous in the first place. What the heck does a 10 year old need 50 bucks a week for?", "Yes life lessons they\u2019re hard to learn sometimes", "$10/day is insane for that age.", "Seriously", "I got 5 bucks a week.  And agreed.", "Thank you, I ruminated on this.", "NTA. That\u2019s right, you watch out for that little sexist turdball of a friend", "\nSeriously.  Parents already pay for everything. \nHonestly jealous of it... I didn't get shit for the chores I did .", "$50 is the new $20 :/", "Seriously! I got $10 a WEEK at 17 (and I\u2019m only 20 now so it\u2019s not like $10 was worth more when I was 17\ud83d\ude2d)", "Agree. We don't tie chores to money, but no 10YO needs $200 a month for \"spending money\" during weekends with dad. Also, the stairs don't need to be swept daily maybe unless you have multiple large dogs.", "I once asked my dad for an allowance. He said \u201cI allow you to live here.\u201d That was the end of that.", "Absolutely NTA", "I got a dollar a week for an allowance for a very long time! It was the 90s so times have changed but wtf do 12 and 10 year olds need with $200/month??", "Who cares if the 10 year old needs it or not. No one knows if the 10 year old is spending it all or putting some in savings for when he is older. Even if the 10 year old is spending it all who cares. Any more $200 really does not go very far any way.", "This must be a universal dad answer. My father said the same, and 'Get a job'.'", "Yeah, I only got an allowance ($200/month) after my sister, and I started doing college in high school, and I had to drive us everywhere. After I got in 2 car accidents, completely my fault and I paid for the repairs after getting a job for the second one, I dropped to 20/month with the other 180 going to car insurance.\n\nI got off lucky and probably only kept car privileges because it was basically a requirement. Been 7 years and haven't been in an accident since.", "You guys got allowances?", "Thanks to inflation it buys 2 games.", "Same"]}
