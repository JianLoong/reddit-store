You didnt recived the full amount of the child support he owed to you and your kids, so he should be ashamed of himself for asking such a thing.\nI'm sorry for his loss, but it's not your problem if he can't pay for his mother funeral.\nSo, be sure to do what you can to recive the rest of the money.
