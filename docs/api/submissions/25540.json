He hasn\u2019t seen his kids for 15 years since they were 2/ before they were born. What good reason do you have to think he would ever want to be in their life? Even if by some miracle he would become interested in the future, I think it would be better for the kids to have the money to pay for college than to reconnect with the deadbeat dad. And if having to pay the child support he owes is a reason for him to not be interested in getting to know them in the future then he doesn\u2019t deserve to get to know them and they are better of without him.", "It's not rubbing it in when he has owed this debt and his children and their mother have struggled and have gone without because of his decision to evade supporting them. Kids still need to eat even if dad isn't paying support.", "Right, but who put it there? Was there a judgment filed in the court and the estate attorney made the payment out of the estate?", "We was together since I was 20yrs old we got married at 22 and had my twins at 28. But we been divorced now 15yrs. I don\u2019t know why I typed 20 my brain was going faster then I was typing. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "That is pretty much what I said!", "This appears to be a bot", "Please also ask your lawyer if it would be possible to force the sale of his mom's house to pay the back support and to get an order for a prepayment of child support for future amounts owing. Some jurisdictions will permit this if there is solid evidence of prior attempts to evade payment obligations.", "They are still quite young and live with their mother, which considering we definitely haven\u2019t heard the other side/full side of the story, it\u2019s safe to say its probably difficult for him to make contact/visitation to the children. Once they are of age to decide what they want (if they want to see their father) things will probably change. Many of my friends who\u2019s family\u2019s followed similar dynamics ended up the same way.", "Uh\u2026they are 15 and 17? Two are in college? He moved away and hasn\u2019t tried to be a dad. Are we reading the same thing ?", "He literally abandoned them & moves every time they catch him to avoid his responsibility. He doesn't care about them. He cares about himself. Otherwise, he would pay the CS & fight to see them instead of ghosting until he wants something. OP's NTA & needs to go to court regarding his new asset before he sells it & runs again.", "Oh so when dad comes crawling back when he\u2019s sick and looking for a relationship to \u201cmake things right\u201d or some other crap the girls should be excited and grateful? Gtfoh with this nonsense. That\u2019s not the mothers problem. **He left them.**"]}
