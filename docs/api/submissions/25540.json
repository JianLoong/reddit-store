Does it suck that he didn' t take his responsibilities seriously previous to this?  yes.  And, now he knows why he should have been a better person.

Also, get a lawyer and put a lien on the mother's house for 55,000. You can do it yourself, it's pretty basic. You have to file in the courthouse of the county where the house is located. And have proof of the debt. Everything is online. Support Enforcement might do it for you. I don't know. This isn't his money or yours. You are the fiduciary agent for your children. You would be negligent in your fiduciary duties to your children to return this money. Even if you take the kids to Disney...it is something they deserve from the funds. Even if you get a small cosmetic procedure.

Get a lawyer now.", "NTA. This is only a partial payment on a very important sum of money that he owes his children. You owe him nothing. \n\nIn situations like these it is really best to stick to the fact that you own and know.

He stopped paying last year, my son is early 20s, but he still owes back support from the almost 10 years he didn't pay. \n\nYou're definitely NTA. Having dealt with my parents both passing, I'm not sure how exactly you got the money in the first place, because generally the estate stuff has to be taken care of before disbursements are paid out and they are paid out by the executor. So it makes me wonder if his mother actually had a life insurance policy or something that you were the beneficiary of that would disburse directly to you? Or did the money come through the child support agency? Because if it didn't come through the child support agency then it doesn't actually count towards what he owes you for child support and he would still owe you the same amount.", "Yep. Contact your lawyer asap to investigate and ideally place a lien so whatever his share of the house is you might get your remaining $55k first. \n\nI would have doubts he owes anything on his mother\u2019s funeral and if he did well nice to know he apparently loved her more in death than he loved his children.", "OP,  use a part of the $$ you have received to hire a lawyer that specializes in estates and probate administration (different from estate planning; these are the attys that handle estates once someone has passed away).\n\nFind out what rights you and your children may have.

I don't know what is possible while the estate is still in probate.  Hence my recommendation to hire a lawyer (specializing in family law - I forgot this in my original comment).
