My sister Kylie and her husband are both vegetarians. They have 2 daughters aged 10 and 13 and they raise them on a vegetarian diet. My wife and I aren't against vegetarian meals, there is some great plant-based cuisine out there and we forego meat often. Recently they stayed with us for 2 weeks while my sister went on a business trip with her husband. She provided pre-prepared meals and snacks for her kids. The first few days we all ate vegetarian but, their stay with us coincided with my wife's week of darkness and my wife likes chicken, liver, and some lean beef during that time. \n\nShe told me she was really craving stuffed chicken breasts so I made some mushroom-spinach stuffed chicken breasts for her and heated up soup for the girls. The oldest asked if she could try some. She hasn't asked to try any of our food before so I asked why and she told me she has been trying some of her friends' lunches at school and she's already tried Lunchables and deli meat sandwiches. I asked her if her parents knew and she said no. Ultimately I cut a chicken breast in half and let her try it- it's just chicken after all, not crack. Then the youngest wanted to try it. They liked it and ate it with their soup. The following day I made my wife the traditional monthly meatloaf and this time, the girls ate our meal instead of one Kylie prepped for them. That's pretty much how the rest of their stay went- I'd let them try what I made if I cooked two meals and let them decide if they wanted some of what I made for my wife or what their mother prepared.\n\nThe girls visited with my parents and from my understanding, the youngest let the cat out of the bag by asking for stuffed chicken like they had at Uncle's house. I learned this when my mother called me to hem me up about disrespecting Kylie's parenting style. She told Kylie about it and I got it from my sister too. I let it roll off my back and didn't say anything, the girls are already trying things away from their parents, no point in pointing that out and potentially making my sister hover around them. However, the girls are now being fussy eaters and are questioning their parents as to why they can't have other things that they've found they like and I'm getting blamed for it.

I see why their mom is mad but IMO this was gonna come eventually as they got older as kids want to become their own person and try new things.

Eating meat is fine, having a trusted family member teach them to sneak around and effectively lie to their parents is not.\n\nThey are definitely old enough to make informed (healthy) choices about their diets. You can put it to Kylie and her husband this way: If a 10yo lived in a meat-eating household but wanted to try being vegetarian or vegan, shouldn't the parents support that? What would they think of a parent telling a child who wants to be vegetarian, \"Meatloaf is what's for dinner. You either eat it, or you go without!\" That would be cruel and authoritarian, would it not? Children that age deserve the choice to be vegetarian *or not*.\n\n(Also, \"week of darkness\" comes off as misogynist, but that's not the issue at hand.)", "ESH - you and your sister both suck in this situation.

My mother acquiesced. Then my sister (the oldest) got into First Grade and had her first school lunch. It was chicken. She freaked out and was very upset. She did not eat and came home feeling sick, stressed, upset, and very hungry. Difficult thing for a little kid. My mother immediately put her foot down and started bringing meat into the house and even cooking it for the kids. \n\nWe had very little money and grew a huge part of our food in a garden. So meat was not often, but she did try. Like with pretty much everything, she wanted us to be educated and informed so that we could make our own decisions. So we were taught about nutrition and how both sides viewed things in terms of ethics, nature, the world, beliefs, etc. \n\nMy dad never handled that well and would do things like hide behind the doorway and crying, \"Gobble gobble don't eat me!\" when we had turkey on Thanksgiving. Might sound funny now, but for small kids it was traumatizing. Especially considering how rare it was we had something like that.\n\nMy sister (that had the traumatic chicken incident) has always eaten meat. It is rare, but she does choose that lifestyle. The term for her is flexitarian.\n\nMy younger sibling and I both made conscious decisions that we wanted the vegetarian lifestyle while we were still kids and have lived that way ever since. \n\nWhile I am firmly of the mind that parents should get to choose how to raise their kids, what Kylie is doing is not cool. Forcing her beliefs on others, even her own children, takes away their autonomy. \n\nThe kids are definitely old enough to make their own choices and should be allowed to learn and get educated so they can develop informed opinions for their futures.\n\nI'm not going to cheer that OP has gone against the wishes of parents, BUT the kids voiced their desires and are doing it anyway. Better to not have them feel the need to be sneaky about it. And if they have gone most all of their lives without eating meat it can cause issues if not introduced slowly so Better to help them in their journey of discovery.\n\nOP is NTA, but the parents kind of are...", "ESH. \n\nYour sister should be letting them decide for themselves at that age.

That is entirely different and has deeper meanings than just emotional/ethical.\n\nPersonally I would want my child (aside from any actual allergy concerns) to happily try things that a friend might bring. Especially if that friend is a different ethnicity and what they have is a cultural item. My kids were always allowed to try anything and everything they desired to help them outside their comfort zones for food.\n\nMy son's newest best friend is Mexican and invited my son for a sleep-over. The mother had homemade tamales and my son had never had them. He tried them and loved them. So he asked me to make them. I had never done so, so I asked his friend's mom to show me. While doing so, my son was there and participated in the process. The mother told the story of how tamales were created and why and all kinds of historical things about Mexico and the foods they eat. It was a really fun time for us all and we learned a lot in the process. Now I make them in volume and freeze them for him to eat whenever he wants one.\n\nFood is the single universal language that bonds every human and does not require the same spoken language to communicate. You can learn so much about a different culture by the foods that are staples in most households and food is a 'language' concept that children understand very easily. The cuisines often tell a story of the history of that culture and kids seek to understand new things better when you introduce it in a way they understand - eating tasty (& maybe not so tasty -looking at you, vegemite) things. At least when I was in elementary school in the 80s, our geography class end-of-unit activities were eating snacks and foods common to that region. No obligation to try them and no grade attached. It was simply a fun thing that our teachers did for us. I would be sad to hear a child deprived of a cultural learning experience because of a dietary choice made for them out of other reasons besides religion.**", "NTA. Kids are going to explore.
