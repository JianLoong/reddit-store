My sister Kylie and her husband are both vegetarians. They have 2 daughters aged 10 and 13 and they raise them on a vegetarian diet. My wife and I aren't against vegetarian meals, there is some great plant-based cuisine out there and we forego meat often. Recently they stayed with us for 2 weeks while my sister went on a business trip with her husband. She provided pre-prepared meals and snacks for her kids. The first few days we all ate vegetarian but, their stay with us coincided with my wife's week of darkness and my wife likes chicken, liver, and some lean beef during that time. \n\nShe told me she was really craving stuffed chicken breasts so I made some mushroom-spinach stuffed chicken breasts for her and heated up soup for the girls. The oldest asked if she could try some. She hasn't asked to try any of our food before so I asked why and she told me she has been trying some of her friends' lunches at school and she's already tried Lunchables and deli meat sandwiches. I asked her if her parents knew and she said no. Ultimately I cut a chicken breast in half and let her try it- it's just chicken after all, not crack. Then the youngest wanted to try it. They liked it and ate it with their soup. The following day I made my wife the traditional monthly meatloaf and this time, the girls ate our meal instead of one Kylie prepped for them. That's pretty much how the rest of their stay went- I'd let them try what I made if I cooked two meals and let them decide if they wanted some of what I made for my wife or what their mother prepared.\n\nThe girls visited with my parents and from my understanding, the youngest let the cat out of the bag by asking for stuffed chicken like they had at Uncle's house. I learned this when my mother called me to hem me up about disrespecting Kylie's parenting style. She told Kylie about it and I got it from my sister too. I let it roll off my back and didn't say anything, the girls are already trying things away from their parents, no point in pointing that out and potentially making my sister hover around them. However, the girls are now being fussy eaters and are questioning their parents as to why they can't have other things that they've found they like and I'm getting blamed for it.

I see why their mom is mad but IMO this was gonna come eventually as they got older as kids want to become their own person and try new things.

Eating meat is fine, having a trusted family member teach them to sneak around and effectively lie to their parents is not.\n\nThey are definitely old enough to make informed (healthy) choices about their diets. You can put it to Kylie and her husband this way: If a 10yo lived in a meat-eating household but wanted to try being vegetarian or vegan, shouldn't the parents support that? What would they think of a parent telling a child who wants to be vegetarian, \"Meatloaf is what's for dinner. You either eat it, or you go without!\" That would be cruel and authoritarian, would it not?

[But no, his wife was having her \"week of darkness\" (screw you, OP, for that)]. He could have called his sister. He could have told the kids that THEY would need to talk to their parents upon their return. They were curious, not starving.

This smacks of grannies giving their grandchildren sweet treats and undermining the parents.\n\nYTA, OP", "Dont Listen to these people. NTA all the way.

You could also talk to your BIL instead of Kylie directly, if you think he'd be less hot-headed about it.\n\nThat your wife coined the term really doesn't matter. Off-color jokes among close friends or partners is fine, but *you chose* to use that phrase in front of a bunch of complete strangers.", "And makes u TA, it's not the meat it's that you don't respect your sister.
