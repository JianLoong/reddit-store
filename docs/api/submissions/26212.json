My platonic partner/caretaker of 15 years (Jim 41M) and I live an hour away, and while her husband has been working as much overtime as he can to earn extra time off, Jim has been the one driving her to her appointments and bringing me to spend time with her so she hasn't been alone as much. My one and only rule is I don't want to know specifics about her pregnancy-related medical issues because of personal trauma. She is entitled to make her own decisions about her life, I'm entitled to my feelings, and I don't want to know so I can reign in my feelings and be respectful. She has a medical folder with updates about her current condition in the event of an emergency.

She surely has other people she could talk about the medical issues. She just chooses the one person that cannot be the supportive friend in this one area. Also very sorry to hear that you are terminal. Hope you still find comfort and joy in the time you have left", "I have mitochondrial disease is it anywhere near that disease mine has no cure or treatment either I don\u2019t like the talks either I just want to live as long as I can", "I understand that you want to support her, but you can't provide the full support system that she needs all by yourself. That can be said for LOTS of people, not just people going through what the two of you are.

You joined a support group for support yes but everyone has boundaries even in a support group that others need to respect. You were clear how you felt and despite having limited support she should have either walked away from the friendship if she couldn\u2019t respect that or understand what you were asking. I understand her husband works a lot but at the end of the day it was his decision to marry her and have a child with her knowing this so it is also his responsibility to be there for her. I do suggest reaching out and letting him know what\u2019s going on so he\u2019s not completely in the dark trying to navigate this new change in relationship but at the end of the day you do need to do what\u2019s best for you as well.

You have communicated a boundary and she has disrespected this boundary. \n\nI'm just giving some advice but I think for your own mental health, you need to step back from this friendship. If her condition means she is likely to pass away in childbirth, then you need to emotionally distance yourself from this situation to avoid worsening your own mental health. Additionally, it might be worth having a mix of healthy and sick friends so you can have some friends who will not drag you down emotionally with their own health situations.\n\nI am so sorry that you have less time in this world than many others and I cannot imagine what this must be like for you. That being said, you have limited time in this world and need to spend it with as many enriched days as possible, so it may be best to distance yourself from those who will dim your days.", "NTA.

Just want to add context to why you\u2019re really really not the asshole here! She is! \n\nAdvice is give of you were my friend. Honestly you and your partner need to take a step back here. You are already becoming enmeshed in her issues and it will get worse when baby comes and she expects you and your partner. You MUST protect your mental health and she\u2019s trampling the boundaries already and I expect it will worsen. It\u2019s actually inappropriate she has you and your partner doing so much for her, both physically and emotionally.\n\nPlease put your own oxygen mask on first and prioritize yourself.

It sounds like she is struggling with the reality of her situation. I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like for her parents either knowing that she is willingly bringing a child into the world she will not be able to care for ultimately. I wonder if that is the bigger reason they are distancing themselves versus her condition in general.", "Absolutely NTA. You were going above and beyond to offer her the support you could, and she repeatedly and selfishly disrespected your boundaries. It seems to be for the best that you keep your distance for now, and let her deal on her own with the consequences of her decision, since she seems unable to respect the one clear boundary you set.", "NTA, her choice is just that, hers! You are not obligated to let her trauma dump, especially on the ONE issues you\u2019ve specifically asked her not to. She is TA, not you.", "NTA and you have me insanely curious about this disease, and I'm hoping hard that your choices mean much more longevity.", "NTA. You\u2019re both in a shitty position but you put down a boundary for your mental health. Her pregnancy does not trump your mental health. You\u2019re dealing with a huge issue, and for her to *knowingly* add to it is cruel and unfair. Pregnant people always think their pregnancy is so much more important than everyone else\u2019s lives and it\u2019s frustrating as hell.", "NTA I am not as close as you to the end of life, but I have been in similar situations and asked people not to talk about/include me, or ask me about certain things that they have repeatedly done particularly about \u00b4my future\u00a0\u00bb knowing that there isn\u2019t one. \nI gave her a half of her get out of jail free card because she\u2019s making a person inside her body and I\u2019m sure her hormones are all over the place and she\u2019s probably lonely and need someone to talk to but really she needs a splash of cold water on her face to get it together and be much more sensitive. She is bringing a whole new life into the world which is a really wild ride and probably very overwhelming, but you have been extremely kind to lend your companionship and time to her while your own time is running out she needs to be really respectful of that.\nOn that note, it\u2019s really great that you\u2019ve chosen to use your time this way. Sometimes I feel like the whole day goes by and I haven\u2019t done anything because I\u2019ve been to week or in too much pain and then the day it\u2019s just gone forever and I mourn it\u2019s passing", "NTA.

You have every right to look after your mental health. Even if it hurts her feelings. She does not have the right to force that upon you. It\u2019s a horrible situation but you cannot be that friend for her for that topic. That\u2019s it. There are topics I cannot talk about with my best friend of almost 40 years, either for her mental health or mind. Your friend needs professional help and that was kind of you to suggest someone that has experience with this.", "NTA. \n\nFirst of all, I\u2019m sorry to hear about your loss of your mother, and also about your health condition. That really sucks. \n\nAs for Margie, you\u2019ve been more than supportive. You\u2019ve just drawn a boundary that is totally understandable.

And that shit sucks. \n\nNta. \n\nYou constantly told her you didn't want to hear about her problems with pregnancy and the disease since you both know the reality of the situation ahead. You've asked her multiple times to change the subject and only bring it up if she needs 911 for whatever reason. He has constantly overstepped your boundaries on this.

You and your husband are essentially her personal assistant in her time of need. You set one personal boundary and she insists on breaking it. She can discuss her problems with other people that aren't you. \n\nIt's her loss. She's self absorbed and inconsiderate.

What makes hers difficult for me is the maternal mortality rate for our medical condition and that it was why my own mother passed away.\n\nYou are quite right, though. It occurred to me from another comment that she might have expectations once the baby is born, ones neither I nor Jim are prepared or willing to meet, so it would be prudent for Margie and her husband to start making other arrangements for care and support.", "No. It's not neurological.\n\nWhile my condition is also really shitty and eventually fatal, it's not something I would attempt to equate to a condition that causes neurological breakdown. Both are awful conditions, but that's like comparing rotten apples to rotten oranges. Different affected body system.", "Seeing as Jim is my caretaker, not Margie's, he was only doing it because I asked him to. If I'm not around, then neither will he be around for her.\n\nAlso platonic partner and platonic friend are not the same thing.", "She\u2019s not an asshole as long as she admits that this person is not her friend\n\nOP is TA for being so controlling over Jim though.", "It wasn\u2019t said but I think OP is saying her friend has the same condition and is at much greater risk of maternal mortality due to it.", "The way it\u2019s written, it sounds like OP\u2019s friend has the same condition and they both knew before-hand that pregnancy and childbirth could/would be fatal for them. It\u2019s too much for OP to handle. NTA, in my opinion.", "Because they share the same disease, and that disease apparently means pregnancy is a *severe* risk with a much greater chance of death than the average pregnancy. Due to sharing the disease and her own mother's death from said disease causing complications during OP's birth, OP has significant trauma around this specific subject and is willing to help as much as possible but doesn't want to hear about the specific medical issues - you know, similar to the ones that *killed her mom* and quite a few friends in their support group.\n\nAll of which was in the post.", "Her friend that\u2019s pregnant has the same disease which having a child can shorten the already shortened life expectancy of her friend. They \u201cdecided to have a baby\u201d knowing this could shorten her life, \u201cher current condition\u201d is most likely where her disease is at this current time in severity, \u201cfaces the reality of her decision\u201d clearly she thought having this baby and dealing with the repercussions and increased likelihood of her disease worsening and her life shortening wasn\u2019t going to be so bad but now she\u2019s realizing it changed a lot.  Friendship is also about respecting one another\u2019s boundaries and OP clearly stated what her boundaries were and if her friend couldn\u2019t agree to those then her friend should have walked away at that point.", "And op's friend knew that op had boundaries.  She put herself into the situation of totally blowing off those boundaries and getting pushback for that is to be expected and is fair.", "Babe, it sounds like Margie has the same condition. If OP is reporting what this condition does even today, Margie's not going to be asking for postpartum support, Margie is going to likely be dead. She's not a drama queen, it sounds like she is *also terminal.*", "how is op the AH? She made it clear since the beginning she wanted nothing to do with the medical part of the pregnancy and she keeps bringing it up even tho she knows.", "This is the first time I have lost my temper since May when this arrangement started, despite repeated gentle, and then firm reminders to change the subject.", "So you think OP should sacrifice her own mental health to let friend stomp all over OPs boundaries?", "Modern day US. I have a genetic disease that severely shortens life expectancy, there is no treatment, and no cure.", "she clearly has some kind of medical condition that shortens her life expectancy", "Op said they had a condition that was genetically passed to them by their mother. It probably doesn\u2019t matter where or when bc it sounds like this condition doesn\u2019t have a sure fire cure.", "She isn\u2019t judging her for her life choices. She can have a baby all she wants. But it is her risk to take and OP who lost her mom in childbirth, doesn\u2019t want to hear about the medical complications friend is having. That is a reasonable boundary and friend is not respecting it and probably thinks op should be her therapist and hold her hand through something OP told her no about. On top of that, it appears op and her husband are both friends ESA and therapist. That isn\u2019t fair at all. I understand the friend might be terrified but she needs to find another way to deal with her fear because she doesn\u2019t get to make OP feel the fear with her.", "It just sounds like a hard situation all around. Im sorry you have to go through it. Maybe someone (ie her husband) needs to have a chat with those parents and snap them back into reality, so they can still spend some time with their kid.", "Also your partner is basically serving as her partner now? That\u2019s intense", ">her parents are emotionally withdrawn and are almost trying to let her go in advance, even though she's still here now.\n\nIt sounds like her parents are going through anticipatory grief. It's grieving for what is to come before it has even happened. They are also likely to be feeling guilt for having passed along the genetic condition, even if they didn't know they were carriers and are struggling to accept their daughter's autonomy in deciding to become pregnant even with all of its risks. I hope that they are able to get counseling to help them cope with everything so that they can support their daughter with whatever she chooses.", "Wait, is your friend from this support group and has your condition?", "Oh that sucks. Hopefully she might be able to find an online support group or something. This situation isn\u2019t fair for either of you.", "I sympathize with her not having much support, but I feel like she's really taking advantage of this friendship and not considering your situation.   Being a shit friend, in short.  NTA.", "It sounds like a NAH situation because you're both going through hell.  I hope she's able to find an additional source of support, especially once the baby arrives.", "I figure as much as well, but it\u2019s not completely clear and I\u2019d love some clarification from Op!", "You\u2019re a very good friend Op.  I\u2019m so sorry that life has given each of you a shitty deal.", "You\u2019re NTA and much more tolerant than I would be able to be. I carry Hemophilia A, my dad died from it when I was 3 and a half, I chose not to have children because I could not do that to a child. \n\nYour friend is SELFISH. She\u2019s ok with leaving a child motherless and willing to risk the child having a short life. Willing to destroy their ability to have healthy children. I couldn\u2019t be there for her. I couldn\u2019t be there for someone who cares more about her experience of being pregnant and birthing a child over the child\u2019s health or the child not being an orphan. IMO, she\u2019s a shitty person and an even worse future mother. Now she\u2019s selfishly putting this on you, after you\u2019ve specifically asked her not to. She\u2019s a shitty friend. If you need to take a step back it\u2019s completely understandable. Some people are just looking for someone, anyone, to support their bad decisions.", "She met her in a support group", "I get what you're saying but this friend has repeatedly disrespected an easy to respect boundary of OP's.", "I understand completely!! Of course this would be hugely triggering and upsetting for you. I am so sorry that your Mom died in childbirth. Your friend made her decision and you and Jim aren\u2019t responsible for supporting her with it. Please take care of yourselves.", "If you\u2019re paying him\u2026..then of course his attention should be on you.", "You said  she's  not paying  him, are you paying  him?", "I didn\u2019t get that part at all. In that way I would understand her more absolutely but as I said she didn\u2019t mention that anywhere and I was really confused. I am not against OP but this stress is not good for both of them.", "I am sorry but nowhere did she say that her best friend had the same condition as her.", "Because her friend is obviously having trauma currently and she is not being there for her?  She is obviously having a hard time, why go off on her?  A good friend would try to help her to find a healthier place to find support.\n\nShe is crying for help.  Kind of shitty to push her away. Not saying OP should be that support and re live her trauma. I\u2019m saying she could have handled it better.", "She is going through a really difficult time and made the mistake of thinking she could get emotional support from her close friends. She isn't wrong for expecting that.\n\nIf you cannot emotionally handle her talking about her pregnancy-related issues, perhaps you should reduce your visits and just leave the support stuff for Jim to do alone.\n\nThe whole purpose of your visits is to make her less alone and feel better. You are not doing that, in fact you are doing the opposite.", "No, I think the solution is to stop visiting her pregnant friend if she finds the experience triggering. That would enforce her boundaries whilst not adding stress/conflict to someone going through a rough pregnancy.", "I have been trying to stay out of it, but perhaps I will privately say something to him, because it's a lot of stress on Margie, and it keeps spilling onto me.", "Yes. We met in an online support group several years ago, and since we turned out to live close to one another, we used to spend quite a bit of time talking to each other and spending time with one another on a friendly basis.", "That's what I understood.", "this is a genuine question - did they meet in the online support group for this issue? that was my understanding of it - they\u2019re friends because they both have the same medical issue and they\u2019re in an online support group.", "it's clear from context that they met at the support group for their condition. otherwise why mention the support group?", "She is already doing a lot. I'm sorry, but I don't agree that you have to be everything to everyone even against your own well being. She was very explicit on how much she was willing to take. She doesnt have to accomodate that just because her friend is in pain, even if she loves her.", "Handled it better how? OP stated she has already made her boundary clear. What is she supposed to do?", "Seeing as Jim is my caretaker, if I am not there, neither is Jim, and that is non-negotiable due to my own health.\n\nBut perhaps you're right that it would be best if we tell Margie and her husband that they need to find other arrangements so that we are not spending as much time with her.", "They're both going through a difficult time.  If I know my friend is traumatized by pregnancy/childbirth I'm going to talk about something else.  Pregnant or not she has to acknowledge her friend's pain, especially when they met in a support group.", "Yes she is wrong for expecting that. OP set her boundaries nice and early.", "So because OP doesn\u2019t want to hear about this one issue, she shouldn\u2019t help her friend at all? Not even driving her to doctor appointments?", "Maybe, just try to trust your gut it\u2019s a hard situation", "I hate to say it, but have they mentioned childcare at all? Sounds like they\u2019re awfully cozy with letting y\u2019all take care of a big part of their life. You don\u2019t usually see people pulling back their requests when the answer to everything is \u201cyes\u201d. You might want to mention up front childcare is a non-starter.", "I was confused about that, too, as OP hasn'te really come straight out and said so, but  I do get the impression that they're in the same support group and both have the same medical issues. It sounds like OP and the friend don't expect the friend to survive the birth.", "It sounded to me like her trauma came from members of her support group dying. She didn\u2019t say the friend came from the group. Since she didn\u2019t mention being worried about her friend dying specifically I don\u2019t think they met there.", "I don\u2019t think you have done anything wrong at all. For your own benefit, it is probably best for you and Jim to back away from the situation.", "She doesn't drive her friend to her appointments. Jim does that.\n\nJim just brings OP along to spend time with the pregnant person while he does the support stuff.\n\nIf OP feels really triggered and the pregnant friend doesn't get the emotional support she needs, what is the point of continuing those meet-ups?", "No, they haven't. Her husband's plan is to take off from work for a while, but beyond on that, I don't know that they have a plan.", "Oh wow. This changes things but I\u2019m not sure how exactly. Like so they are possibly both about to die?", "They did. She said in a reply that her friend's parents have emotionally checked out because they anticipate losing her.", "I am beginning to see that, but I think it wouldn't just be to my benefit. Jim is doing it because he genuinely cares for me, I'm doing it because I love Margie and I know she's going through a hard time, but Margie doesn't have the support system she needs, and we're just two people who can't do it all, and it's too hard on all of us.\n\nI think if I can convince her husband to encourage her to make use of palliative care, to which she is entitled, then that right there would be a huge help. Palliative care was how I met Jim in the first place. They can help with at home care, therapy, pain management. I only volunteered to do it because Margie's been very opposed to palliative care, although I'm not sure why.", "Oh, so OP should sacrifice her mental health OR time with her partner for her boundary pushing friend? Suuuuure that seems fair. Ooops eyes rolled right out the back of my head just then", "did u miss the whole \"jim is my caretaker\" part?", "Yes, they have the same condition. The friend decided to get pregnant knowing that giving birth will probably kill her (which is what happened to OP\u2019s mom).", "OP says she gave the husband the contact details for her therapist who specialises in palliative care patients, so I read it as this friend is from the support group too \n\nBut Op also may have just suggested the only therapist she knows (given she has specific mental health support needs)", "That\u2019s really sad. I don\u2019t think it excuses OPs behavior and attitude tho. She sounds really bitter.", "Do you know for sure that her condition/health issues are going to result in her death?", "OP should sacrifice nothing. Stopping visits to the friend is a way of firmly enforcing her boundaries.", "Sure, I saw that her partner was also her caregiver. I just didn't realize that was a 24/7 role.\n\nIt doesn't change my point that if both OP and the pregnant friend are not getting what they want out of their meet-ups, perhaps the meet-ups shouldn't happen. That protects both of their mental health.", "I just don't understand this. What is the appeal of having a child if you most likely won't even be able to live to raise it? Why would her husband agree? \n\nI know adoption and whatnot can be expensive but *surely* it's a better option to pay with cash than with your life?", "of course she's bitter. she is in her late 30s and contemplating the end of her life. her mother died in childbirth. she herself can't have children, however much she might have wanted them. now she has to watch her friend with the same condition endanger her life and relive old trauma in the process. where is your empathy?", "There is no 100% certainty, no. The maternal mortality rate is lower than it was when I was born, and it's been dropping ever since as people become more aware of the condition, but the mortality rate is still many times the normal rate for healthy mothers.", "Did you miss the part where Jim is her partner? If OP doesn\u2019t go she loses the time with him that it takes to drive to friend, pick her up, go to appt, take her home, then drive back.", "OP had one rule that wasn't that hard to follow. If OP isn't there then jim can't be there so the pregnant friend has to get someone else to do the support stuff.", "And then likely (50/50) dooming your kid to the same shortened lifespan? Jesus.", "Yeah I'm completely lost as to how leaving a child with her husband to parent alone is even remotely appealing to them??? I don't understand.", "I know, this is all very Steel Magnolias. I don't get it either. Who knows what kind of pressure they're under from family. OP says their support group has lost *several* members to pregnancy issues and childbirth. Maybe it's a combination of wanting to feel like their short life had \"purpose\", and connecting their self worth to the ability to reproduce. So much to unpack. I really feel for OP's friend but she's being completely selfish and disregarding OP's trauma.", "Hmm. Maybe she just doesn't want to face that and is avoiding palliative care as a result? If she's determined to live then I can understand the reluctance.\n\nThat's unrelated to the issue at hand though\u2014just an aside about a resource she isn't willing to take up. Hopefully she does go for some kind of therapy so your interactions can be more healthy for both of you."]}
