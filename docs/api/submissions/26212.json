It's entirely possible I could live longer because of taking good care of myself, but the average is late 30s. My mother had the same condition I do and died at age 22 from childbirth. I decided to never have children to avoid passing my disease on (50% chance) or leaving children behind for someone else to raise, potentially knowing they ended their own mother's life, which was honestly a really crappy way to grow up.\r  \n\r  \nI joined a support group online ten years ago, and in that time, while we have gained new members, we've lost a number to age, and a number of women to pregnancy and childbirth complications.\r  \n\r  \nOne of my closest friends Margie (26F) has decided to have a baby with her husband. My platonic partner/caretaker of 15 years (Jim 41M) and I live an hour away, and while her husband has been working as much overtime as he can to earn extra time off, Jim has been the one driving her to her appointments and bringing me to spend time with her so she hasn't been alone as much. My one and only rule is I don't want to know specifics about her pregnancy-related medical issues because of personal trauma. She is entitled to make her own decisions about her life, I'm entitled to my feelings, and I don't want to know so I can reign in my feelings and be respectful. She has a medical folder with updates about her current condition in the event of an emergency. Jim and I aren't being paid for our time, gas, etc. It's all volunteer.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, as her pregnancy has progressed and things have started to get worse, she keeps trying to slip things in. On Friday she brought it up again, I asked if she needed us to call 911 and her husband. She said no, and I lost my temper and told her, \"Then stop bringing it up. I have one rule and you keep trying to break it. Unless you need medical attention, can we please talk about something else?\"\r  \n\r  \nShe cried silently for nearly an hour even after I apologized and then told Jim and I to not bother showing up for Labor Day when we left, which left her husband confused because she wouldn't tell him what happened. I gave him the number for my therapist who specializes in palliative care patients because I know she needs support, and I feel bad for hurting her feelings. But I don't want to be her therapist as she faces the reality of her decision. I don't want her dumping her health on me, not while I'm dealing with mine.

She surely has other people she could talk about the medical issues. She just chooses the one person that cannot be the supportive friend in this one area. Also very sorry to hear that you are terminal. Hope you still find comfort and joy in the time you have left", "I have mitochondrial disease is it anywhere near that disease mine has no cure or treatment either I don\u2019t like the talks either I just want to live as long as I can", "I understand that you want to support her, but you can't provide the full support system that she needs all by yourself. That can be said for LOTS of people, not just people going through what the two of you are. She should not be depending on you alone, so hopefully she takes you up on the therapist.\n\nThat being said, you set forth boundaries, and if she agreed to that, she's the AH for trying to step on that.\n\nNTA, and I wish you both the best.", "NTA\n\nDoes Margie have the same or similar condition to you? Your post makes it seem like Margie is at a high risk of dying die to her pregnancy\u2026. But it isn\u2019t clear and I\u2019m not so sure why it\u2019s so doom and gloom. \n\nEither way\u2026 you\u2019re not an asshole. You are offering her lots of support but you made your one boundary very clear and she keep violating it.", "NTA - your friend knows what happens to women her age with this disease who have children. You joined a support group for support yes but everyone has boundaries even in a support group that others need to respect. You were clear how you felt and despite having limited support she should have either walked away from the friendship if she couldn\u2019t respect that or understand what you were asking. I understand her husband works a lot but at the end of the day it was his decision to marry her and have a child with her knowing this so it is also his responsibility to be there for her. I do suggest reaching out and letting him know what\u2019s going on so he\u2019s not completely in the dark trying to navigate this new change in relationship but at the end of the day you do need to do what\u2019s best for you as well.

You are setting a boundary in order to maintain your mental health. I wish you all the best in maintaining your physical health as well.", "NAH. Y'all are doing your best.", "NTA.

She needs to find another support system for a bit.", "NTA. You have communicated a boundary and she has disrespected this boundary. \n\nI'm just giving some advice but I think for your own mental health, you need to step back from this friendship. If her condition means she is likely to pass away in childbirth, then you need to emotionally distance yourself from this situation to avoid worsening your own mental health. Additionally, it might be worth having a mix of healthy and sick friends so you can have some friends who will not drag you down emotionally with their own health situations.\n\nI am so sorry that you have less time in this world than many others and I cannot imagine what this must be like for you. That being said, you have limited time in this world and need to spend it with as many enriched days as possible, so it may be best to distance yourself from those who will dim your days.", "NTA.  You are very kindly supporting her to travel to her appointments and have one request. She refuses to honor that one request.

Just want to add context to why you\u2019re really really not the asshole here! She is! \n\nAdvice is give of you were my friend. Honestly you and your partner need to take a step back here. You are already becoming enmeshed in her issues and it will get worse when baby comes and she expects you and your partner. You MUST protect your mental health and she\u2019s trampling the boundaries already and I expect it will worsen. It\u2019s actually inappropriate she has you and your partner doing so much for her, both physically and emotionally.\n\nPlease put your own oxygen mask on first and prioritize yourself. This situation is understandably enormously triggering for you and she needs to reach out to other people. Be kind to yourself OP.", "NTA\n\nIf it's a trigger for you then she needs to respect your boundaries. You warned her and she's tried to ignore that. That is the behaviour of a self centred person.", "NTA at all!!! You sit the boundary with her from the start. You and Jim are already going above and beyond. It sounds like she is struggling with the reality of her situation. I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like for her parents either knowing that she is willingly bringing a child into the world she will not be able to care for ultimately. I wonder if that is the bigger reason they are distancing themselves versus her condition in general.", "Absolutely NTA. You were going above and beyond to offer her the support you could, and she repeatedly and selfishly disrespected your boundaries. It seems to be for the best that you keep your distance for now, and let her deal on her own with the consequences of her decision, since she seems unable to respect the one clear boundary you set.", "NTA, her choice is just that, hers! You are not obligated to let her trauma dump, especially on the ONE issues you\u2019ve specifically asked her not to. She is TA, not you.", "NTA and you have me insanely curious about this disease, and I'm hoping hard that your choices mean much more longevity.", "NTA. You\u2019re both in a shitty position but you put down a boundary for your mental health. Her pregnancy does not trump your mental health. You\u2019re dealing with a huge issue, and for her to *knowingly* add to it is cruel and unfair. Pregnant people always think their pregnancy is so much more important than everyone else\u2019s lives and it\u2019s frustrating as hell.", "NTA I am not as close as you to the end of life, but I have been in similar situations and asked people not to talk about/include me, or ask me about certain things that they have repeatedly done particularly about \u00b4my future\u00a0\u00bb knowing that there isn\u2019t one. \nI gave her a half of her get out of jail free card because she\u2019s making a person inside her body and I\u2019m sure her hormones are all over the place and she\u2019s probably lonely and need someone to talk to but really she needs a splash of cold water on her face to get it together and be much more sensitive. She is bringing a whole new life into the world which is a really wild ride and probably very overwhelming, but you have been extremely kind to lend your companionship and time to her while your own time is running out she needs to be really respectful of that.\nOn that note, it\u2019s really great that you\u2019ve chosen to use your time this way. Sometimes I feel like the whole day goes by and I haven\u2019t done anything because I\u2019ve been to week or in too much pain and then the day it\u2019s just gone forever and I mourn it\u2019s passing", "NTA.

You\u2019ve given all you can to your friend", "NTA \n\nyou made your boundaries clear and she ignored them and brought it up anyways.", "NTA- you set a reasonable boundary considering the whole situation", "NTA. You have every right to look after your mental health. Even if it hurts her feelings. She does not have the right to force that upon you. It\u2019s a horrible situation but you cannot be that friend for her for that topic. That\u2019s it. There are topics I cannot talk about with my best friend of almost 40 years, either for her mental health or mind. Your friend needs professional help and that was kind of you to suggest someone that has experience with this.", "NTA. \n\nFirst of all, I\u2019m sorry to hear about your loss of your mother, and also about your health condition. That really sucks. \n\nAs for Margie, you\u2019ve been more than supportive. You\u2019ve just drawn a boundary that is totally understandable.

And that shit sucks. \n\nNta. \n\nYou constantly told her you didn't want to hear about her problems with pregnancy and the disease since you both know the reality of the situation ahead. You've asked her multiple times to change the subject and only bring it up if she needs 911 for whatever reason. He has constantly overstepped your boundaries on this. This was her decision to have a kid and shorten her life span more. Not yours. You shouldn't be doomed to hear about it every time you see or speak to her.", "NTA. You and your husband are essentially her personal assistant in her time of need. You set one personal boundary and she insists on breaking it. She can discuss her problems with other people that aren't you. \n\nIt's her loss. She's self absorbed and inconsiderate.

It\u2019s too much for OP to handle. NTA, in my opinion.", "Because they share the same disease, and that disease apparently means pregnancy is a *severe* risk with a much greater chance of death than the average pregnancy. Due to sharing the disease and her own mother's death from said disease causing complications during OP's birth, OP has significant trauma around this specific subject and is willing to help as much as possible but doesn't want to hear about the specific medical issues - you know, similar to the ones that *killed her mom* and quite a few friends in their support group.\n\nAll of which was in the post.", "Her friend that\u2019s pregnant has the same disease which having a child can shorten the already shortened life expectancy of her friend.

She can have a baby all she wants. But it is her risk to take and OP who lost her mom in childbirth, doesn\u2019t want to hear about the medical complications friend is having. That is a reasonable boundary and friend is not respecting it and probably thinks op should be her therapist and hold her hand through something OP told her no about. On top of that, it appears op and her husband are both friends ESA and therapist. That isn\u2019t fair at all.

It's grieving for what is to come before it has even happened. They are also likely to be feeling guilt for having passed along the genetic condition, even if they didn't know they were carriers and are struggling to accept their daughter's autonomy in deciding to become pregnant even with all of its risks. I hope that they are able to get counseling to help them cope with everything so that they can support their daughter with whatever she chooses.", "Wait, is your friend from this support group and has your condition?", "Oh that sucks.

She\u2019s ok with leaving a child motherless and willing to risk the child having a short life. Willing to destroy their ability to have healthy children. I couldn\u2019t be there for her. I couldn\u2019t be there for someone who cares more about her experience of being pregnant and birthing a child over the child\u2019s health or the child not being an orphan. IMO, she\u2019s a shitty person and an even worse future mother. Now she\u2019s selfishly putting this on you, after you\u2019ve specifically asked her not to. She\u2019s a shitty friend.

She is obviously having a hard time, why go off on her?  A good friend would try to help her to find a healthier place to find support.\n\nShe is crying for help.  Kind of shitty to push her away.

I\u2019m saying she could have handled it better.", "She is going through a really difficult time and made the mistake of thinking she could get emotional support from her close friends. She isn't wrong for expecting that.\n\nIf you cannot emotionally handle her talking about her pregnancy-related issues, perhaps you should reduce your visits and just leave the support stuff for Jim to do alone.\n\nThe whole purpose of your visits is to make her less alone and feel better. You are not doing that, in fact you are doing the opposite.", "No, I think the solution is to stop visiting her pregnant friend if she finds the experience triggering. That would enforce her boundaries whilst not adding stress/conflict to someone going through a rough pregnancy.", "I have been trying to stay out of it, but perhaps I will privately say something to him, because it's a lot of stress on Margie, and it keeps spilling onto me.", "Yes.

I'm sorry, but I don't agree that you have to be everything to everyone even against your own well being. She was very explicit on how much she was willing to take. She doesnt have to accomodate that just because her friend is in pain, even if she loves her.", "Handled it better how? OP stated she has already made her boundary clear. What is she supposed to do?", "Seeing as Jim is my caretaker, if I am not there, neither is Jim, and that is non-negotiable due to my own health.\n\nBut perhaps you're right that it would be best if we tell Margie and her husband that they need to find other arrangements so that we are not spending as much time with her.", "They're both going through a difficult time.  If I know my friend is traumatized by pregnancy/childbirth I'm going to talk about something else.  Pregnant or not she has to acknowledge her friend's pain, especially when they met in a support group.", "Yes she is wrong for expecting that. OP set her boundaries nice and early.", "So because OP doesn\u2019t want to hear about this one issue, she shouldn\u2019t help her friend at all? Not even driving her to doctor appointments?", "Maybe, just try to trust your gut it\u2019s a hard situation", "I hate to say it, but have they mentioned childcare at all? Sounds like they\u2019re awfully cozy with letting y\u2019all take care of a big part of their life. You don\u2019t usually see people pulling back their requests when the answer to everything is \u201cyes\u201d. You might want to mention up front childcare is a non-starter.", "I was confused about that, too, as OP hasn'te really come straight out and said so, but  I do get the impression that they're in the same support group and both have the same medical issues. It sounds like OP and the friend don't expect the friend to survive the birth.", "It sounded to me like her trauma came from members of her support group dying.

Since she didn\u2019t mention being worried about her friend dying specifically I don\u2019t think they met there.", "I don\u2019t think you have done anything wrong at all. For your own benefit, it is probably best for you and Jim to back away from the situation.", "She doesn't drive her friend to her appointments. Jim does that.\n\nJim just brings OP along to spend time with the pregnant person while he does the support stuff.\n\nIf OP feels really triggered and the pregnant friend doesn't get the emotional support she needs, what is the point of continuing those meet-ups?", "No, they haven't. Her husband's plan is to take off from work for a while, but beyond on that, I don't know that they have a plan.", "Oh wow. This changes things but I\u2019m not sure how exactly. Like so they are possibly both about to die?", "They did. She said in a reply that her friend's parents have emotionally checked out because they anticipate losing her.", "I am beginning to see that, but I think it wouldn't just be to my benefit. Jim is doing it because he genuinely cares for me, I'm doing it because I love Margie and I know she's going through a hard time, but Margie doesn't have the support system she needs, and we're just two people who can't do it all, and it's too hard on all of us.\n\nI think if I can convince her husband to encourage her to make use of palliative care, to which she is entitled, then that right there would be a huge help. Palliative care was how I met Jim in the first place. They can help with at home care, therapy, pain management. I only volunteered to do it because Margie's been very opposed to palliative care, although I'm not sure why.", "Oh, so OP should sacrifice her mental health OR time with her partner for her boundary pushing friend? Suuuuure that seems fair. Ooops eyes rolled right out the back of my head just then", "did u miss the whole \"jim is my caretaker\" part?", "Yes, they have the same condition. The friend decided to get pregnant knowing that giving birth will probably kill her (which is what happened to OP\u2019s mom).", "OP says she gave the husband the contact details for her therapist who specialises in palliative care patients, so I read it as this friend is from the support group too \n\nBut Op also may have just suggested the only therapist she knows (given she has specific mental health support needs)", "That\u2019s really sad. I don\u2019t think it excuses OPs behavior and attitude tho. She sounds really bitter.", "Do you know for sure that her condition/health issues are going to result in her death?", "OP should sacrifice nothing. Stopping visits to the friend is a way of firmly enforcing her boundaries.", "Sure, I saw that her partner was also her caregiver. I just didn't realize that was a 24/7 role.\n\nIt doesn't change my point that if both OP and the pregnant friend are not getting what they want out of their meet-ups, perhaps the meet-ups shouldn't happen. That protects both of their mental health.", "I just don't understand this. What is the appeal of having a child if you most likely won't even be able to live to raise it? Why would her husband agree? \n\nI know adoption and whatnot can be expensive but *surely* it's a better option to pay with cash than with your life?", "of course she's bitter. she is in her late 30s and contemplating the end of her life. her mother died in childbirth. she herself can't have children, however much she might have wanted them. now she has to watch her friend with the same condition endanger her life and relive old trauma in the process. where is your empathy?", "There is no 100% certainty, no. The maternal mortality rate is lower than it was when I was born, and it's been dropping ever since as people become more aware of the condition, but the mortality rate is still many times the normal rate for healthy mothers.", "Did you miss the part where Jim is her partner? If OP doesn\u2019t go she loses the time with him that it takes to drive to friend, pick her up, go to appt, take her home, then drive back.", "OP had one rule that wasn't that hard to follow. If OP isn't there then jim can't be there so the pregnant friend has to get someone else to do the support stuff.", "And then likely (50/50) dooming your kid to the same shortened lifespan? Jesus.", "Yeah I'm completely lost as to how leaving a child with her husband to parent alone is even remotely appealing to them??? I don't understand.", "I know, this is all very Steel Magnolias. I don't get it either. Who knows what kind of pressure they're under from family. OP says their support group has lost *several* members to pregnancy issues and childbirth. Maybe it's a combination of wanting to feel like their short life had \"purpose\", and connecting their self worth to the ability to reproduce. So much to unpack. I really feel for OP's friend but she's being completely selfish and disregarding OP's trauma.", "Hmm. Maybe she just doesn't want to face that and is avoiding palliative care as a result? If she's determined to live then I can understand the reluctance.\n\nThat's unrelated to the issue at hand though\u2014just an aside about a resource she isn't willing to take up. Hopefully she does go for some kind of therapy so your interactions can be more healthy for both of you.", "NTA. I will never understand why someone with a deadly genetic disease chooses to have children. Even if it wasn't something that was going to likely kill her just giving birth, that's if she even makes it long enough for the child to be born. Even if the \"odds\" are good that it won't be passed on. Essentially, she and her husband are playing Russian roulette with their baby's life. Of course, it is their decision. IMO, it is a very selfish one.", "NAH. I feel like if you two discussed the decision she has made it would just get really messy and painful.

Call her and tell her you love her and support her, but she needs to remember you are at the high end of the age of this condition, and you just don't want to talk about it in this case, and if she cares about you, she should understand that. Remind her you can't even talk openly and honestly because you don't want to scare or upset her, and want her to stay positive, but \\*hint\\* you have a family trauma involving stuff. It's just not something you are at all okay with talking about, for all of those reasons.\n\nMaybe- if you want- you could say you are okay to talk about all of it if she wants but you don't think she will like that because of the feelings you have and how much you will want to talk about a personal related trauma. If she pushes it say your Mom died of it, and it affected decisions. But you didn't want to bring in your Mom or your personal choices to her pregnancy. That should get her to stop.\n\nI feel so much for all of you.  But it is wrong of her to use you like this... You've given so much, which is so amazing, and now it feels like she's using you by trying to manipulate you into being her therapist about this, when you've probably been pretty careful to not let your own feelings about the illness and pregnancy and your Mom's death come into play- for a reason. Maybe she doesn't get that though. Even if it hurts, it might be good to gently remind her (or perhaps her husband who might be able to broach it especially softly) *why* it's not best for both of you to be open about stuff for her sake. Or who knows, maybe she's okay with you being honest about how you feel like it could kill her, idk. Either way, it should be your choice. You are doing enough.

Also not autosomal dominant.\n\nAlso OP has denied that it\u2019s any type of hemophilia.  \n\nI\u2019m almost certain it\u2019s a connective tissue disease.\n\nThe increased pregnancy risk, autosomal dominance, and the decreased life expectancy all fit OP\u2019s description.", "My empathy is with the other woman who has a friend who isn\u2019t being super supportive at a time when she really needs it.", "Pregnancy is most likely going to kill her. That is why OP doesn't want to talk about it, because it killed her mother. And it is the reason she decided not to have children herself.", "You'd have to be stupid to try to set up someone not likely to live 10 years a new born.", "They're not, people are speculating because \"they won't talk about it, so obvi that means they're gearing up to make OP take the kid.\" Because commenters here lack an astounding amount of logic sometimes.", "I also thought this may be what her friend is up to as well\u2026.", "I wonder if she's hoping she might be one of the few (if there are any) to survive it.", "Some people just want to leave \"a piece of themselves\" behind for their partners and their partners go along because they want something to hold on to. \n\nIMO it is very selfish because it's all about what they want and not about the child itself. I was lucky enough to get almost 11yrs with my mum before she died and now 22yrs later it still hurts not having her, I can not even begin to imagine how it would feel to know I was \"responsible\" if I had lost my mum at birth like what the most likely scenario before OPs friend. Add in to that trauma the potential for an evil stepmum to enter the picture (like we see so all to often here on reddit) and you are setting that kid up for the worst possible life, especially if the father who was initially on board with the pregnancy (despite the cost) growing to resent the kid.", "I'm aware. Even with that in mind, I can't wrap my head around sacrificing her life for the chance (since the baby may also not survive the birth) at bearing a child who will then be left motherless with a newly widowed father.", "But if you die to bear it, you still won't have it. That seems like it would be even more painful because you'll be *so close* to having your dream. Feeling your baby kick and imagining all the things you'd do if you could be there, knowing you probably won't live to see any of it. I'm pregnant right now and it's hard to imagine a worse situation than leaving my baby behind. To choose that boggles the mind.", "I guess I can see why that might influence their decision, but it seems like trading someone who's still alive for essentially a stranger who reminds you of them. Add on that the baby has a 50/50 shot at inheriting the condition and I just don't see how they're expecting anything more than heartbreak for everyone involved.", "Not just willing to watch your wife die, but knowing that your child has 50% chance to have that same condition and die young, too?", "You seem incredibly confident about that, even though you just generalized ALL bleeding disorders together, believe the OP is exaggerating about the severity of the complications experienced in pregnancy with their condition, but still believe you have the right condition.\n\n I happen to have one of the conditions you listed (for real for real, and yes I know you probably often have run-ins with people who claim to have a different type of one of the conditions, because I come across those people a lot too) and not only is pregnancy not spoken about this way amongst those of us in the community, neither is death or \"nearing the end of the lifespan.\" Death occurs suddenly and randomly, some of us are 15 and some are 75. The average lifespan lands somewhere in between just because of the way averages work, not because your health gradually declines and then you pass in your 40s. None of the way these people are speaking sounds like a tissue fragility type CTD. I suppose we can agree to disagree though.", "Because she chose to get pregnant in the full knowledge it may kill her? \ud83d\ude05 It sounds like the friend was fully informed of the risks going into this, *and* that it\u2019s how OP lost her mom, and she still expects full logistical + emotional support from OP. That\u2019s really entitled.", "Yeah, it definitely sucks how the friend is not being supportive of OP at the time that OP really needs it.\n\nAlso, OP is literally *the* most supportive person the other woman has right now. And you are saying that because OP is not supportive in *one* way then OP is not super supportive at all? Damn, you must be a doormat."]}
