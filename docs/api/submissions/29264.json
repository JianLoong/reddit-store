We are both kind of introverts and had a lot of fun together. We were pretty inseparable, schoolmates from elementary to college. \n\nWe are also both \u201cno boyfriend since birth\u201d. Our college friends would often call us virgin marys but we didn\u2019t give a shit. Now that we\u2019re both grown up adults, the talk about settling down and having a family is being brought up now in our friend group. But it was always same sentiment for Rosie and I, that we don\u2019t see ourselves having men. We\u2019re both straight females but I don\u2019t know, the idea of getting together with a man was not an idea we both entertain since then.\n\nWe would always joke around that we\u2019ll just get rich and live and grow together with our cats. This is always brought up whenever family members from our families ask why we don\u2019t have a man (our families are close and always hang out). Rosie would always tag me on FB posts about single women living together in a mansion. \n\nNow, this year, she\u2019s been assigned to a different state for her job. She said that the place has bad signal so it became difficult for us to communicate online. She got really busy as well and we didn\u2019t find time to update each other anymore. This was also the time that I met Josh (cousin\u2019s new friend). Josh is a funny and caring guy, completely opposite to my shy personality. We\u2019ve hit it off right away and have been officially together for 2 months now. I wanted to share the exciting news to Rosie when I was starting to date Josh so I texted her about it, which was just delivered and never read.\n\nNow she went back this week and was appalled when she read all my texts about Josh. She came to me and said I was a traitor. She said I broke our promise about never getting a man. I asked if she\u2019s drunk coz I believe we were just joking about that stuff. Apparently, she\u2019s serious about it.\n\nI asked my older sister and she said that promise must be really serious for Rosie, but even she finds it ridiculous.\n\nRosie now stopped talking to me. She blocked me on all communications and refused to talk. AITA?\n\n\n\nEdit to update:\nSo she unblocked me on messenger and sent me a message. I asked to talk face to face or at least through call but she said she was not comfortable. I said sorry about not being on the same page as her and for thinking that this promise when we were young was not serious. It was a long message from her which is all about being sorry for calling me a traitor but that I can\u2019t force her to bond with my boyfriend because that\u2019s not her thing. And that I can\u2019t go to her if I get my heart broken because of him. I\u2019m quite shocked with her quite aggressive tone when I didn\u2019t even bring him up n this conversation. I didn\u2019t reply because I don\u2019t know what to say anymore.\n\nI\u2019m sad because I already imagine hanging out with her and my boyfriend, but I guess this is not gonna happen soon\u2026 or ever. I don\u2019t know.", "created_utc": 1697741278, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17bqesy/aita_for_breaking_my_promise_to_my_best_friend_by/", "score": 468, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You matured and wanted more than platonic friendships and that's totally normal!  Vowing to be celibate your entire life for no reason is an odd promise to make or expect of a friend.  Hopefully she'll think about this situation and still want to be friends even though you broke your vow of celibacy.", "NTA.

It's not about being drunk; it's about trust and keeping your word. You betrayed Rosie by going against what you both agreed on for years.

This didn\u2019t happen for her, she kind of stayed back there and stayed a kid in a way and she felt you abandoned her even though you just evolved. \n\nAnd I do not think she was in love with you! She just wanted a friend or a sister relationship forever without the drama of a man or risk you leaving and starting your own family without her.

Really, it just means Rosie genuinely imagined that life with you, either as a friend or as a partner. \n\nI wouldn't say Rosie is an AH either. Sure, *you* weren't being serious, or not as serious as her, but that doesn't automatically mean you're both on the same page.

Don't engrave into stone what you once thought in your teens.\nshe probably like you just did not find a right man who would find his way into her heart. And that's fine... I didn't date a man until I was 29. Doesn't make me a lesbian...just had different priorities at younger age...I think she felt she had this lifestyle she could share with you and not feel as an odd one out and now she is the last one of the friends and family who doesn't have a relationship so she is angry because of that.

It seems like you were in a codependent relationship for a very long time and it has warped your perception of adult relationships.

Regardless of wether she has feelings for you or not, regardless of the seriousness of any childhood promises or not, this obviously hurt her on a level you didn\u2019t expect. That doesn\u2019t mean you should stop living your life, and you\u2019re not wrong with wanting your friend to be happy for you. Just, offer the olive branch.

Always talked about living our lives out as best friends, birthdays tattooed on each other, she joined the military after me and elected to be stationed at the same base as me. We both had boyfriends throughout our friendship, but when I got married she went off. Turns out she thought we\u2019d end up together eventually. I\u2019m as straight as can be, haven\u2019t heard from her in over 6 years.", "NTA. Anyone who would hold someone to a promise *made as a child* is an asshole. Her orientation is irrelevant, tho wanting the promise in the first place could have had something to do with it.\n\nYour friendship has run its course, as they sadly often do. She wants her fantasy, where it's the two of you against the world, forever and ever, amen. You want reality and the chance to find a partner of your own. It would be great if reality could include her as your friend, but she won't allow it.\n\nLeave the door open so she knows she can change her mind, but let her know as long as she is treating you and your bf badly, she doesn't have a place in your life.", "NTA for having a boyfriend or thinking that childhood promised did not apply w=once grown up. But you do need to realize your friend is stuck in that mode and will not join you in adulthood. Do not try to force it.", "NTA. Misery loves company.", "NTA. I don't think she's in love with you, like many other comments have suggested. I mean that's possible, but far more likely is that she has come to view you as reliably hers. She won't be alone because she'll always have you, if she never finds a boyfriend she will still always have a friend, etc etc. She is probably feeling afraid of losing you due to you having a SO now and she is feeling insecure because she has not found a boyfriend and she doesn't feel she can \"compete\" for your attention compared to your BF. It's not a particularly healthy way to view a friend, but I don't think it's particularly malicious or dangerous either. Give her time to adjust and if she keeps being aggressive or nasty about it tell her you won't tolerate being treated that way and reduce contact.", "NOPE! I had a friend like this named Stella and it was so damn toxic. She told me she could no longer be friends with me at 27 when I was dating my husband. I had boyfriends before but we weren\u2019t in the same city at that time. It was horrible and I felt so guilty. I didn\u2019t realize she was trying to control me. I always had an inkling that she saw us more of a couple than as best friends.", "I have this feeling your friend is not as straight as you'd think. She's probably still in her closet but from sounds of it she wanted her future with you and only you and the reaction is not the one you'd expect from a friend but from a lover.\n\n\nOn one hand I think promises should be kept BUT you should never promise something you are not willing to keep. So promise that you'll never have a man or settle down especially if it's 10 year old saying that is really silly and it's expected to be broken since you never know who you meet and in what situation you'll end up in.\n\nNTA OP. Your friend is not entirely honest with you and possibly with herself.", "It almost sounds like Rosie is secretly into you, and doesn't want to admit it, even to herself.\n\nWell, you're not a mind reader.  It's not your fault that she doesn't know what she wants, and cannot communicate it to you.\n\nYou've moved on, and are developing a relationship.\n\nYou're NTA for doing so, OP.\n\nRosie is an asshole for her harsh reaction to you for the \"breaking\" of a \"childhood promise\".", "I do believe your best friend never left 8th grade.. there is some severely stunted emotional growth at play here", "NTA, and I see people suggesting Rosie is a closeted lesbian, but another possibility (coming from someone who spent a lot of their life in the same boat), she\u2019s an asexual who doesn\u2019t know asexuality is a thing. Asexuality is seldom talked about, even in LGBT+ spaces, and as such a lot of people just don\u2019t consider that not experiencing romantic or sexual attraction towards ANY gender, is a valid sexuality. If you asked me, before I found out what asexuality was, I would have told you I was straight simply because I didn\u2019t have anything specifically saying I wasn\u2019t. The absence of attraction doesn\u2019t tend to be a part of the sexuality discussion. \n\nIt sounds like you were someone she might have been using to ground herself, using to tell herself she wasn\u2019t alone in her experience, because it is an experience that honestly and truly makes you feel like an outsider in so many aspects of life, whether you\u2019re aware of it or not. I won\u2019t go on a rant, but I think it might be worth doing some research and seeing if this is something that would make sense for her.", "Nta", ".", "I had a friend do this every time I got into a relationship.\nApparently there were feelings for me I was oblivious to.\nDo what you will with that info.", "i dont know how to describe her but are REALLY REALLY sure she is straight?

It is ridiculous for a grown-ass woman to expect her friend to never have a relationship with a man because of something they agreed to when they were 10 years old. Rosie needs therapy.", "chill Rosie it aint that deep", "She could be also envious that Op found a boyfriend before her. People tend to feel threatened when they realize the people they were supposed be in the same sinking ship together sailed off. Like you feel uneasy you have loads of stuff to do but feel better after you see your friend or someone else has even more stuff and in a worse place then you are. I had same issue with my friends not to this extend but similar. They were not in love with me and stopped their passive aggressive comments once they found partners. A friend of my literally said because they didn\u2019t see my partner I must be hallucinating and my SO does not exist haha.", "Luckily for your parents, lol.", "It's not because she might be questioning, that has little to nothing to do with it. It's because she seems to think OP was serious about it, just like she was. \n\nI do it often because of the autism; I take people more literally than they actually wind up being because I don't know how to interpret it any other way. I can't call her an AH for doing something similar just because she may not be autistic like me. It's just not an AH thing to misinterpret something.", "NTA and frankly, there\u2019s no reason to apologize. To expect someone to hold true to something they said when they were a kid or even a teenager is ridiculous and quite childish. As a kid, I told my parents my goal was to be the GM of the Chicago Bulls after college, that\u2019s not something they ever held me to. \n\nYou seem like you\u2019re a great friend and it is very kind you would want to apologize but realize that you\u2019re only excusing Rosie\u2019s behavior by doing that. Which doing that is unfair to both you and her. You\u2019re apologizing for something you shouldn\u2019t be and you\u2019re stopping her from using this moment as an opportunity to grow.", "I'm not sure I agree. If he was her best friend, and she found out he had feeling for her, I imagine she would still want to save that friendship. Assuming it wasn't just some elaborate long-game being played to win her over anyway.", "I had a friend like Rosie in high school. It was always a little strange in the moment, but they came out after we went to (separate) colleges and suddenly a lot more things about our friendship finally made sense to me. \n\nWhat I thought was sibling like in nature was NOT what they intended. What I don't know at this point is how conscious they were about their sexuality when we were closer. Looking back though, it was clear as day that they are queer and so far from straight lol.", "There might be romantic feelings on her side but I'm not as convinced as the others. \nWhy? I understand how she feels. I have a friend like this. Friends for over a decade, went through a lot together, matching friendship tattoos, the whole schtick. \nIn HS we'd talk about going to the same uni and being roommates and I'd look forward to all the fun we were going to have. When things went differently, I was heartbroken, I couldn't see my future anymore. \nIt hurt more than me not getting into the uni I wanted \n\nIt ended up being the best thing for both of us. I saw how codependent I was on her. How when I was a lonely child from a neglectful home I built up friendship as something that would fulfill all those needs. If I could only find it. That's what friendship was in books and on TV after all, a family. \n\nI've had to do a lot of work to unravel those expectations and see that just because my friends don't always put me first (like I'd do for them at that time) that doesn't mean they don't love me. Or that they secretly hate me like I'd convince myself.\n\nAnd yet when she got a boyfriend I was still a bit upset. Not in a way where I'd show it much to her, I'd never do what your friend did, not at that point. \n\nI did try a few guilt trips when I was younger, I'm not proud of it but it's how my family communicated hurt feelings. Assign responsibility to the person who hurt you and try to make them feel that pain. It was awful for everyone involved and when I eventually realized what I was doing (not till uni sadly) I felt really bad about it and apologized. \n\nBut yeah the problem was me and the more I realised it the better our relationship got. By not hanging on too tight we managed to remain close and are still best friends. \n\nAnd you know what? I really like her boyfriend too. At first I felt left behind, hell, sometimes I still do, as I'm still single. It's hard to be the only single friend in friend groups, especially when that one friend who's always been your buddy in singleness finds someone. It makes you think, why not me? What's wrong with me?\n\nThose feelings are normal, but they're not her fault. I now see, that I didn't lose her to him, I gained another friend. By this point, we've all been friends for years and have even gone on trips together which I ended up enjoying as much if not more than the \"just us\" trips. It definitely took time though and I had to work through a lot of the weird stigma around \"third wheeling\".\n\nWhat helps is that when I'm around they're not super lovey dovey and rarely make me feel left out (and even if they do that's my feeling to deal with, not their fault). \nYour friend might just need some time to adjust to her new reality. Eventually she might come around and realise this was the best thing that could happen for your friendship. Codependence is a comfort zone, it stunts your growth and brings toxicity into a relationship. But that doesn't mean it's easy to feel like you've lost that comfort zone.\n\nGive her time and definitely try to make time to still see her one on one when she's ready. When she realises she hasn't lost you to him she might come around to him as well.\n\nOf course if she is actually in love with you and it's not just a codependent friendship with some blurred lines here and there, it will be much harder and you might lose her. You might lose her either way. But that's life and it's definitely not your fault, as long as you don't actually ditch her for the new BF (which is not always an unfounded fear).\n\nSorry this was long, but I felt I could give some perspective on what the friend might be feeling beyond simple romantic feelings.", "You can\u2019t control the way you feel but you can control the way you act.", "Pillow friends?", "Just because one is aromantic and/or asexual doesn't mean one wants to live alone forever."]}
