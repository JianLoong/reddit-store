{"id": 29264, "submission_id": "17bqesy", "title": "AITA for breaking my promise to my best friend by having a bf?", "selftext": "I (24f) have been best friends with (24f) Rosie (fake name) since we were like 10. We are both kind of introverts and had a lot of fun together. We were pretty inseparable, schoolmates from elementary to college. \n\nWe are also both \u201cno boyfriend since birth\u201d. Our college friends would often call us virgin marys but we didn\u2019t give a shit. Now that we\u2019re both grown up adults, the talk about settling down and having a family is being brought up now in our friend group. But it was always same sentiment for Rosie and I, that we don\u2019t see ourselves having men. We\u2019re both straight females but I don\u2019t know, the idea of getting together with a man was not an idea we both entertain since then.\n\nWe would always joke around that we\u2019ll just get rich and live and grow together with our cats. This is always brought up whenever family members from our families ask why we don\u2019t have a man (our families are close and always hang out). Rosie would always tag me on FB posts about single women living together in a mansion. \n\nNow, this year, she\u2019s been assigned to a different state for her job. She said that the place has bad signal so it became difficult for us to communicate online. She got really busy as well and we didn\u2019t find time to update each other anymore. This was also the time that I met Josh (cousin\u2019s new friend). Josh is a funny and caring guy, completely opposite to my shy personality. We\u2019ve hit it off right away and have been officially together for 2 months now. I wanted to share the exciting news to Rosie when I was starting to date Josh so I texted her about it, which was just delivered and never read.\n\nNow she went back this week and was appalled when she read all my texts about Josh. She came to me and said I was a traitor. She said I broke our promise about never getting a man. I asked if she\u2019s drunk coz I believe we were just joking about that stuff. Apparently, she\u2019s serious about it.\n\nI asked my older sister and she said that promise must be really serious for Rosie, but even she finds it ridiculous.\n\nRosie now stopped talking to me. She blocked me on all communications and refused to talk. AITA?\n\n\n\nEdit to update:\nSo she unblocked me on messenger and sent me a message. I asked to talk face to face or at least through call but she said she was not comfortable. I said sorry about not being on the same page as her and for thinking that this promise when we were young was not serious. It was a long message from her which is all about being sorry for calling me a traitor but that I can\u2019t force her to bond with my boyfriend because that\u2019s not her thing. And that I can\u2019t go to her if I get my heart broken because of him. I\u2019m quite shocked with her quite aggressive tone when I didn\u2019t even bring him up n this conversation. I didn\u2019t reply because I don\u2019t know what to say anymore.\n\nI\u2019m sad because I already imagine hanging out with her and my boyfriend, but I guess this is not gonna happen soon\u2026 or ever. I don\u2019t know.", "created_utc": 1697741278, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17bqesy/aita_for_breaking_my_promise_to_my_best_friend_by/", "score": 165, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She needs to get a grip.\n\nGive her time, that's all I can say.", "NTA. She needs to grow up.", "NTA.  Who takes anything they said as a 10 year old seriously?  I never kept my promise to become Batman", ">We\u2019re both straight females\n\nIt is possible that that is not the case, because this sounds a lot like your friend has feelings for you and is hurt you are dating someone.

Also, as a lesbian i really have to wonder if Rosie is gay and hasn't figured it out yet cause this sounds like a LOT of in the closet stories I've heard and seen.", "NTA.  Maybe Rosie is asexual?  You matured and wanted more than platonic friendships and that's totally normal!  Vowing to be celibate your entire life for no reason is an odd promise to make or expect of a friend.  Hopefully she'll think about this situation and still want to be friends even though you broke your vow of celibacy.", "NTA.  You were a naive little girl making a promise you didn't understand and now you are an adult woman.  \"Rosie\" should also understand that.  You just grew up.  I also agree with the others commenting on Rosie's likely other motives here.", "As an exceptionally queer woman myself...that's kinda gay. NTA", "NTA I think Rosie may actually be a lesbian and in love with you. Thinking that you to would be together at some point. It\u2019s very ok and good for you to have a healthy relationship.", "INFO: Does Rosie have other friends aside from you, and vice versa? Like many comments here, she must be having romantic feelings for you.", "NTA- it is kind of weird that your friend is holding you to a verbal agreement that you made while you were kids.", "NTA. It was an immature \"promise\" that shouldn't have been made anyway. I can understand her feeling of betrayal thinking you both would stay single and end up Platonic Life Partners, but she needs to realize that it's pretty normal to shift and change and grow as you age and she needs to allow your friendship to mature.", "NTA. But im preeeetty sure Rosie is in love with you and doesnt realize it or admits it.", "YTA. You made a promise with your best friend, and now you're acting like it's just a joke. It's not about being drunk; it's about trust and keeping your word. You betrayed Rosie by going against what you both agreed on for years. If the promise seemed ridiculous to you, you should have discussed it openly with her instead of just breaking it. It's not about your sister finding it ridiculous; it's about you being a friend who can't be trusted to keep your word.", "Doubling down that Rosie is a lesbian or a child stuck in a child's body.

Rosie has an unrealistic fantasy about your relationship and may have romantic feelings for you. Reach out in friendship, but if she rejects your outreach, cut her loose and get on with your life. You do not need that kind of negativity. Best wishes to you and Josh,", "NTA.

Instead, she feels betrayed. Maybe it\u2019s because she feels like she can\u2019t get a boyfriend so she\u2019s being left behind, she had to move and you\u2019re replacing her, maybe she\u2019s asexual or queer but not into you and feels like you are the same but this shows you\u2019re not, shes in love with you, or some combination of above. No matter what, it\u2019s her deal. You like your boyfriend, people say they\u2019ll love their lives a certain way when they\u2019re kids and don\u2019t live up to it all the time.

It\u2019s great that you found a nice guy, I\u2019m happy for you but I do feel bad for your friend too because I can relate.\n\nSome people just don\u2019t really grow up and are able to hold onto their child mentality and promises. You grew up and moved on and life happened. This didn\u2019t happen for her, she kind of stayed back there and stayed a kid in a way and she felt you abandoned her even though you just evolved. \n\nAnd I do not think she was in love with you! She just wanted a friend or a sister relationship forever without the drama of a man or risk you leaving and starting your own family without her. It\u2019s kind of sad.\n\nBut she blocked you and stopped talking to you which makes me wonder how she could throw away your friendship that easily.", "NTA, but Rosie may not be as straight as you, or even herself, believe.\n\nDoesn't necessarily mean she's into you, she could be aromantic, asexual, or both after all. Really, it just means Rosie genuinely imagined that life with you, either as a friend or as a partner. \n\nI wouldn't say Rosie is an AH either. Sure, *you* weren't being serious, or not as serious as her, but that doesn't automatically mean you're both on the same page. And considering she *genuinely* doesn't imagine her life with a man and thought you were the same, it makes a lot of sense that she was upset and hurt.\n\nPersonally, I'd apologize for not being on the same page (am highly suspected autistic, so I do so a lot) and hurting her feelings, even if it was on accident, and ask if you can talk it out with her.", "NTA, just because your friend is some variation of ace or queer and in denial does not mean you have to follow her example.", "Rosie is a lesbian.", "NTA\n\nRosie needs serious help.\n\nHer fixation on your childhood promise, sharing photos of women who live together in large houses, and the fact she was upset enough to call you a \"traitor\" says she views you in an obsessive way.\n\nYou getting a boyfriend and moving on may be enough to possibly make her grow up and get over her fixation, but I'd advise you to be on the lookout for her when out and about and keep an eye on her social media because her fixation could turn nasty very easily.", "NTA obviously. People grow up and mature and get on with the life naturally and that's how it should be... Don't engrave into stone what you once thought in your teens.\nshe probably like you just did not find a right man who would find his way into her heart. And that's fine... I didn't date a man until I was 29. Doesn't make me a lesbian...just had different priorities at younger age...I think she felt she had this lifestyle she could share with you and not feel as an odd one out and now she is the last one of the friends and family who doesn't have a relationship so she is angry because of that. Don't take it to heart.", ">We\u2019re both straight females\n\nI think one day down the line you'll find out that you were wrong about that.\n\nBut if Rosie is Ace or Bi or questioning or whatever, she's going to have to work through it without insulting your choices.

It seems like you were in a codependent relationship for a very long time and it has warped your perception of adult relationships. The fact that you never allowed yourself to date someone because of a promise you made in highschool doesn't make any sense. It makes me wonder if perhaps your friend is secretly in love with you because I can see no other reason why she wouldn't want you to be in a relationship.\n\nI don't mean to sound cruel because I don't know what your life has been like. But this read like it was written by a 16 year old. If you are 25 and living this situation, you need to put some distance between you and this girl, and focus on yourself.

It's her fault anyways for just thinking you would keep a promise you made when you were literally 10", "NTA... its completely natural that you'd outgrow this promise. As many childhood promises go, this one was good for it's time. It may have even benefited you by allowing you to grow and mature befor getting enmeshed with a romantic partner. \n\nYour friend has issues she needs to work out. I'd give her some space.

Here\u2019s the thing, even if you ended up in a qpr type situation, a platonic life partner situation together, that involves communication like any other partnership. When she moved, were you involved in that decision? She\u2019s not making an effort to communicate with you regularly. It would essentially be like ghosting your partner, or moving away from your partner without discussing it with them.\n\nI\u2019m not going to jump on the \u201cshe\u2019s a lesbian\u201d train that everyone else is. She could be straight. Could be aro ace. But that\u2019s not the part that matters. The part that matters is that if she was expecting you to be platonic life partners, that involves a serious conversation about what that means and the expectations. And if she thought you were life partners/had that discussion already, then she wasn\u2019t holding up her end of that and doesn\u2019t have a leg to stand on being indignant about it.
