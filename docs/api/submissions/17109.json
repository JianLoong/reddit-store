She rarely smoked when we first started dating (maybe one cigarette every other week if we went out someplace), but then she went back to school to get another teaching certification which stressed her out and that caused her to smoke multiple times a day. I remember her apartment smelled awful because her father and brother also smoked constantly, and I didn't want to move in with someone the was going to make my whole place reek of cigarettes. I told her I'd give her a year to quit (she was going to be done with school that summer so she had until the end of the year to go back to her previous usage), otherwise I wouldn't be able to continue dating her. She switched to vaping, which was a fair compromise since it eliminated the main issue (the smell.) We talked about what it would take to quit vaping completely (it was getting more and more difficult to even get the Juul pods she liked) and it was basically \"when I'm pregnant\", well she's pregnant now so the vaping stopped.\n\nAnyway, while I get what you're trying to do, reward your boyfriend for quitting, it just doesn't sound like you care that much of he quits at all. It's more of a \"I bet that you can't do this really difficult task\" and then holding that over his head when he fails. If his smoking is affecting you and your relationship, then let that be the reason he quits. Not to see Taylor Swift in concert, and then taunt him by threatening to go with his sister instead. Just know that he will likely never quit unless he truly wants to, if you're okay with that reality then don't torture him by offering him things for achieving nearly impossible goals. At least encourage him to do something small that is achievable, like reduce consumption. If he smokes a pack a week, maybe see if he can transition to two packs every three weeks. Something small, but much more easily achievable than stopping completely.", "NTA. He agreed to the deal and is now upset that you're sticking to it. Too bad for him.

Hinging rewards onto something like that just doesn't seem smart, and it will only compound how shitty he'll feel if he doesn't manage to quit smoking in time for the concert.

To how it has a greater hold on people than heroin and its borderline impossible to quit, which is just enabling not being committed to the effort. \n\nMost heroin overdoses that aren't suicides happen when someone is trying to get clean, and they relapse, then the combo of taking more because of the sense of failure and guilt plus the lower tolerances of quitting becomes lethal. You see a similar pattern with a type of addiction that might be more relatable to cigarettes which is compulsive eating. They stick to a program, but once they do something that feels like they've failed and they're sad about that, they return to the comfort of indulging in food. It's both a comfort and a sense of self punishment at the same time(just like self cutting/self harm).\n\nBy setting one huge goal and one huge reward like this you're only setting up pitfalls. He's unlikely to succeed 100% if he tries, so you create the cycle explained above. Or you still give the reward at less than 100% success which makes the goal and reward feel arbitrary. Or he's not even trying/being committed to be effort from the start because of the subconscious prediction of those two outfalls from the start. Like even allowing himself to have that expectation to begin with just sets himself up to feel hurt and disappointed so it's easier to manage the emotions if he didn't really try and wasn't expecting to succeed.\n\nThis isn't about who's right or wrong.

Half-heartedly gave it up a couple times then took up again. In the end, I went cold turkey. It sucks but there's no point torturing yourself by trying to \"cut down\" over months. It's not just the chemical you're giving up but also the habit of smoking while driving, after meals, on work break, when feeling stressed, when bored, as an accessory to drinks etc. It's more of a lifestyle change than just shaking a single vice.\n\nMy best advice is to reward good behavior and get him to ask for help with distractions; negative reinforcement is not helpful here. That means offer a reward (even just a hug) when he succeeds instead of taking things away when he fails. The struggle is hourly in those first couple days , so let him know how proud you are that he's trying and when he goes even one day without smoking. If he's about to crack on his own, he needs to speak up so you guys can go for a walk, put a movie on, work out, make a meal, do something he enjoys so he can push through the craving and establish some success in a new pattern. Exercise and novel activities really help. Giving in to smoking once or twice does not mean he has failed and it's all a waste, so don't get super weird if it happens.
