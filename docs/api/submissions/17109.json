She rarely smoked when we first started dating (maybe one cigarette every other week if we went out someplace), but then she went back to school to get another teaching certification which stressed her out and that caused her to smoke multiple times a day. I remember her apartment smelled awful because her father and brother also smoked constantly, and I didn't want to move in with someone the was going to make my whole place reek of cigarettes. I told her I'd give her a year to quit (she was going to be done with school that summer so she had until the end of the year to go back to her previous usage), otherwise I wouldn't be able to continue dating her. She switched to vaping, which was a fair compromise since it eliminated the main issue (the smell.) We talked about what it would take to quit vaping completely (it was getting more and more difficult to even get the Juul pods she liked) and it was basically \"when I'm pregnant\", well she's pregnant now so the vaping stopped.\n\nAnyway, while I get what you're trying to do, reward your boyfriend for quitting, it just doesn't sound like you care that much of he quits at all. It's more of a \"I bet that you can't do this really difficult task\" and then holding that over his head when he fails. If his smoking is affecting you and your relationship, then let that be the reason he quits. Not to see Taylor Swift in concert, and then taunt him by threatening to go with his sister instead. Just know that he will likely never quit unless he truly wants to, if you're okay with that reality then don't torture him by offering him things for achieving nearly impossible goals. At least encourage him to do something small that is achievable, like reduce consumption. If he smokes a pack a week, maybe see if he can transition to two packs every three weeks. Something small, but much more easily achievable than stopping completely.", "NTA. He agreed to the deal and is now upset that you're sticking to it. Too bad for him.

Hinging rewards onto something like that just doesn't seem smart, and it will only compound how shitty he'll feel if he doesn't manage to quit smoking in time for the concert.

To how it has a greater hold on people than heroin and its borderline impossible to quit, which is just enabling not being committed to the effort. \n\nMost heroin overdoses that aren't suicides happen when someone is trying to get clean, and they relapse, then the combo of taking more because of the sense of failure and guilt plus the lower tolerances of quitting becomes lethal. You see a similar pattern with a type of addiction that might be more relatable to cigarettes which is compulsive eating. They stick to a program, but once they do something that feels like they've failed and they're sad about that, they return to the comfort of indulging in food. It's both a comfort and a sense of self punishment at the same time(just like self cutting/self harm).\n\nBy setting one huge goal and one huge reward like this you're only setting up pitfalls. He's unlikely to succeed 100% if he tries, so you create the cycle explained above. Or you still give the reward at less than 100% success which makes the goal and reward feel arbitrary. Or he's not even trying/being committed to be effort from the start because of the subconscious prediction of those two outfalls from the start. Like even allowing himself to have that expectation to begin with just sets himself up to feel hurt and disappointed so it's easier to manage the emotions if he didn't really try and wasn't expecting to succeed.\n\nThis isn't about who's right or wrong.

Overall I disagree, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that obvious. I might be culturally german and more strict with these things tho. But to me this sounds like an unsupportive partner to make deals and let your significant other just back out when they fail. OP is maybe an TA for agreeing to this in the first place, but so did he, enthusiastically. What\u2019s the point of making any goals together if you just give in. Yes, quitting smoking is hard af, nobody is doubting that. But you\u2018ll never be able to quit if you\u2019re so lenient with yourself that you cannot even hold *yourself* accountable for consequences as minor as not going to a concert you\u2019re not even losing money on. The consequences of smoking is death, I understand the struggle but I lack the sympathy. I might agree that future concerts should be up for discussion, but giving in here sets a terrible precedent for any future promises in the relationship. Not that I think she should stay with a chainsmoker to begin with."]}
