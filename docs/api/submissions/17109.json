She rarely smoked when we first started dating (maybe one cigarette every other week if we went out someplace), but then she went back to school to get another teaching certification which stressed her out and that caused her to smoke multiple times a day. I remember her apartment smelled awful because her father and brother also smoked constantly, and I didn't want to move in with someone the was going to make my whole place reek of cigarettes. I told her I'd give her a year to quit (she was going to be done with school that summer so she had until the end of the year to go back to her previous usage), otherwise I wouldn't be able to continue dating her. She switched to vaping, which was a fair compromise since it eliminated the main issue (the smell.) We talked about what it would take to quit vaping completely (it was getting more and more difficult to even get the Juul pods she liked) and it was basically \"when I'm pregnant\", well she's pregnant now so the vaping stopped.\n\nAnyway, while I get what you're trying to do, reward your boyfriend for quitting, it just doesn't sound like you care that much of he quits at all. It's more of a \"I bet that you can't do this really difficult task\" and then holding that over his head when he fails. If his smoking is affecting you and your relationship, then let that be the reason he quits. Not to see Taylor Swift in concert, and then taunt him by threatening to go with his sister instead. Just know that he will likely never quit unless he truly wants to, if you're okay with that reality then don't torture him by offering him things for achieving nearly impossible goals. At least encourage him to do something small that is achievable, like reduce consumption. If he smokes a pack a week, maybe see if he can transition to two packs every three weeks. Something small, but much more easily achievable than stopping completely.", "NTA. He agreed to the deal and is now upset that you're sticking to it. Too bad for him.

Hinging rewards onto something like that just doesn't seem smart, and it will only compound how shitty he'll feel if he doesn't manage to quit smoking in time for the concert.

It's just not a good idea.", "What would be a better way to support someone with an addiction? I\u2019ve googled it and nothing seems to help, so I\u2019m at my wits end. Although that doesn\u2019t make dangling the tickets over his head okay, from what I\u2019m reading", "Shake it off?", ">It\u2019s an addiction that is hard to stop\n\nAbsolutely. One thing OP should look into is whether her boyfriend is stressed about something, and that stress is pushing him to smoke? Not saying that's necessarily the case, but some people do smoke to relieve stress. If she's serious about helping her boyfriend quit, she should find the root of the problem and attack that.", "Was he smoking when you started dating?", "Definitely not being too harsh you gave him plenty of notice, it would be an objective improvement for his health if he stopped. Speaking of that, make sure you are safe from the second hand smoke if he does it so often.", "As an ex smoker, he's just blowing smoke up your butt, hold him accountable for the deal he agreed to. NTA", "You're asking relationship advice from people who mostly have never been in a long-term relationship.  If you decide to play bad cop then you run a serious risk of not being in a long-term relationship for much longer.", "Yes - it\u2019s so hard! Exactly why I think it\u2019s naive of the OP to say they want to quit so she expects they will and stay that way. The truth is that they may be a smoker for the rest of their life and if that is a deal breaker then it\u2019s something that needs to be discussed.\n\nI don\u2019t care about the tickets think, but long term there is no guarantee he will ACTUALLY stop smoking no matter whether he promised or not.", "Yes - so hard! I think the OP stating that she went into the relationship with him saying he wanted to quit shows some nativity. Quitting is hard, people often relapse. There was never any guarantee he would ACTUALLY stop smoking no matter whether he wanted to or not. \n\nI don\u2019t really care about the tickets, I think the whole deal thing is weird, but I think it\u2019s weird that OP seems to just think he can stop smoking and will stay that way so easily", "He has to actually want to quit smoking to do it. I'm a smoker and have quit several times and ended up going back. I'm currently about to give it up again and hopefully for good this time. Like most people with an addiction, it's up to them to quit. I had a friend that quit and took up running to get her mind off of it.", "You have to keep trying.  I went cold Turkey, and then just when drinking, and then just when stressed, and every time you fail, it needs to be a \u201cI\u2019m starting again now\u201d not \u201cI can\u2019t do this\u201d.", "I used chantix first time. Used nicotine gum second time. Third time i quit cold turkey and havent gone back. No matter how you quit you have to actually want to do it for it to work.", "My boyfriend used vaping to quit smoking. He vaped for like a year and slowly lowered the amount of nicotine, and then eventually quit altogether. He was smoking a pack a day and quit because it was too expensive. I didn\u2019t realise how annoying the smoking was and how much it affected our lives until he quit so good luck to your bf!", "Fwiw I couldn\u2019t have done it without an electronic cigarette. But I was really intentional after I switched to taper the nicotine in the juice. So then it\u2019s just the behavioral addiction instead of both at once. \n\nThat said, the juice is distilled in the e-cig and it\u2019s toxic to kids and pets so make sure it\u2019s stored safely and you wash hands really well after loading the e-cig. \n\nQuitline doesn\u2019t like this method. But it\u2019s the only thing that worked for me.", "I quit after 20+ years of smoking with a prescription for Varenicline (Chantix).  It worked like a miracle for me. \n\nBut it doesn't work for everyone. Some people get terrible side effects. I had no side effects at all.", "Smoke weed instead lol. But not nearly as much", "I get it. I dated a smoker. He \u201cquit\u201d by switching to a vape and that was better by far.", "I did read the whole thing. I still don't think it's healthy for their relationship for her to be dangling candy over his head as if he were a child.", "He changed his mind", "Start smoking and then try quitting. Ive watched my mother struggle for almost 2.5 decades trying to quit everything from the patch to gum to addicts meetings. She always found her way back to smoking. Dangling a reward over his head was only going to provide pressure and stress which can only be solved by you guessed it...... smoking.", "Is there something that's causing him a lot of stress in his life? If so, maybe he's smoking to relieve that stress. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he feels that the joy he gets out of smoking is worth the shortened lifespan. Some people see it that way.", "You literally cannot make someone quit something if they don\u2019t want to.", "What you just said is a very great start to support a person with addiction: try to understand. The key is just support, no judgement, no rewards, no pressure. Lust love and understanding.", "There are therapists and doctors who specialize in that subject, so I suggest checking in your area if there is one. From personal experience, sometimes you really do need experts for this kind of thing.\n\nIt was a whole lifestyle change for me, so it meant saying goodbye to my favorite hangout spots (bars), even some friends who couldn't understand why I couldn't \"just *stop* at *one* drink.\" Reading through your replies to my comment, it seems that it'll need to be something similar for your partner. It wasn't a matter of just stopping doing one thing and going on with everything else as usual. When I quit smoking (which was much easier than drinking for me, after two years of doing it), there were intense physical changes. Not as bad as the hell that is alcohol withdrawal, but I did gain weight, feel sluggish, and have really bad headaches for a few weeks. I think counseling will help your partner, because when you're going through all that, no reward in the world will look as good as just one cigarette/one drink.", "It\u2019s very difficult! I gave up smoking 13 years ago and it was the best thing I ever did and also one of the hardest, my husband still smokes and I hate it and we argue over it and I can\u2019t make him quit and he won\u2019t because he\u2019s not ready to quit. We live in Australia and a packet of 30 cigarettes cost $50 and this is a serous financial burden for our family, we both work full time and we have 2 kids and zero savings although I do add extra money fortnightly into my superannuation - this is only equivalent to 1 packet of smokes when realistically he buys at least 3 packs a week and is not going to quit as far as I can see. So ESH here because quitting is really hard and if you have never smoked you can\u2019t understand and hopefully he will want to quit soon.", "\u201cNo matter what happens in life, be good to people. Being good to people is a wonderful legacy to leave behind.\u201d", "That's not really her job though, if he's serious about quitting he needs to seek help from addiction specialists.", "He was, but told me he was trying to quit", "My dad quit cold Turkey after 20+ years by swapping out cigarettes for chewing sunflower seeds.

And then the sunflower seeds were a lot easier to quit than the cigarettes \ud83d\ude02", "No lie, I hosted a friend for a month (was supposed to be 1 week, we caught covid lol), but he had switched to vaping quite a bit beforehand. One night I asked if I could use it bc it was late and I didn't want to go outside. I accidentally quit cigarettes, obviously not right away but by the time he left I had abandoned my pack lol\n\nI tried having a cigarette a couple times shortly after and they tasted SO BAD, I'd quit in the past and starting back up there is a bad taste. But it was like battery acid, I couldn't finish the cigarette and heavily regretting buying a whole pack. I didn't even want one when I was around my boyfriend who both smoked the same cigarettes and was a heavy smoker.", "My husband and I both went on Chantix to quit... it helped him, but I had terrible side effects... I literally woke up each day so depressed that I couldn't get out of bed.", "Even if he just did that! I\u2019d be over the moon happy", "For sure. Vapes get a lot of bad publicity, but at least they don't put all that tar into your lungs. Definitely an improvement, 100%.", "Whether it\u2019s smoking or any other issue, he agreed to the deal.  He hasn\u2019t held up his end.  He can\u2019t now complain and expect her to give in just because. If he really wanted to go to these events, he shouldn\u2019t have said he\u2019d quit in the first place \u2026and tried a different approach", "Then he could have spoken up. Saying \"hey this method doesn\u2019t work to motivate me, but I\u2018d still like to go\" is a valid thing to do. Making promises, breaking them and still expecting her to hold her end of the deal is shitty.", "He\u2019s been doing it since he was a child and most of  his family and friends do it. He\u2019s asked for my help quitting, but I don\u2019t know how. I understand it\u2019s hard, and I can\u2019t webmd him better, but I\u2019m open to all suggestions", "They all smoke at the same time typically, and when he\u2019s not there he says he just feels like he needs it", "He does want to, it\u2019s just hard", "For sure. That's ultimately what needs to happen, though he needs to agree to see a therapist. It can't just be her decision.", "So he lied, he wasn't actually trying to quit, he just wanted to get you off his case about it", "I think you can\u2019t then hold this over him now.

Sure, a change might be nice but if this was a deal breaker for you, you didn\u2019t have to date him.", "I normally lurk but this reminded me of my mom. She did Chantix I believe and quit in a week\u2026.and then it was clear she had a skittles addiction. She be buying big bags of skittles and just eat a handful.

That makes it sound like she's being passive-aggressive about it.", "Thank you! I understand that smoking is bad for you and all that, but you don\u2019t get to make decisions for other people and her trying to force him into going through this process when he\u2019s not ready is not going to help him. The withdrawal is awful, the headaches, the desperately wanting just a little bit of nicotine. He needs to be ready to go through it, and he clearly isn\u2019t. She knew he had this problem when she chose to be with him, and smoking isn\u2019t the kind of problem someone else can fix for you so she\u2019s either gonna have to deal with it, or leave him because that\u2019s really her only options.", "There were shells in his car for AGES!!!
