She rarely smoked when we first started dating (maybe one cigarette every other week if we went out someplace), but then she went back to school to get another teaching certification which stressed her out and that caused her to smoke multiple times a day. I remember her apartment smelled awful because her father and brother also smoked constantly, and I didn't want to move in with someone the was going to make my whole place reek of cigarettes. I told her I'd give her a year to quit (she was going to be done with school that summer so she had until the end of the year to go back to her previous usage), otherwise I wouldn't be able to continue dating her. She switched to vaping, which was a fair compromise since it eliminated the main issue (the smell.) We talked about what it would take to quit vaping completely (it was getting more and more difficult to even get the Juul pods she liked) and it was basically \"when I'm pregnant\", well she's pregnant now so the vaping stopped.\n\nAnyway, while I get what you're trying to do, reward your boyfriend for quitting, it just doesn't sound like you care that much of he quits at all. It's more of a \"I bet that you can't do this really difficult task\" and then holding that over his head when he fails. If his smoking is affecting you and your relationship, then let that be the reason he quits. Not to see Taylor Swift in concert, and then taunt him by threatening to go with his sister instead. Just know that he will likely never quit unless he truly wants to, if you're okay with that reality then don't torture him by offering him things for achieving nearly impossible goals. At least encourage him to do something small that is achievable, like reduce consumption. If he smokes a pack a week, maybe see if he can transition to two packs every three weeks. Something small, but much more easily achievable than stopping completely.", "NTA. He agreed to the deal and is now upset that you're sticking to it. Too bad for him.

Hinging rewards onto something like that just doesn't seem smart, and it will only compound how shitty he'll feel if he doesn't manage to quit smoking in time for the concert.

To how it has a greater hold on people than heroin and its borderline impossible to quit, which is just enabling not being committed to the effort. \n\nMost heroin overdoses that aren't suicides happen when someone is trying to get clean, and they relapse, then the combo of taking more because of the sense of failure and guilt plus the lower tolerances of quitting becomes lethal. You see a similar pattern with a type of addiction that might be more relatable to cigarettes which is compulsive eating. They stick to a program, but once they do something that feels like they've failed and they're sad about that, they return to the comfort of indulging in food. It's both a comfort and a sense of self punishment at the same time(just like self cutting/self harm).\n\nBy setting one huge goal and one huge reward like this you're only setting up pitfalls. He's unlikely to succeed 100% if he tries, so you create the cycle explained above. Or you still give the reward at less than 100% success which makes the goal and reward feel arbitrary. Or he's not even trying/being committed to be effort from the start because of the subconscious prediction of those two outfalls from the start. Like even allowing himself to have that expectation to begin with just sets himself up to feel hurt and disappointed so it's easier to manage the emotions if he didn't really try and wasn't expecting to succeed.\n\nThis isn't about who's right or wrong.

That means offer a reward (even just a hug) when he succeeds instead of taking things away when he fails. The struggle is hourly in those first couple days , so let him know how proud you are that he's trying and when he goes even one day without smoking.

The problem seems to be that neither understand how to quit and its creating animosity between them.   \n\n\nYea you can leave someone whenever you want but it's kind of unfair for the person smoking to keep stringing them along with the promise of quitting. When you genuinely love someone, you want to believe them, and if their SO is actively telling them that they are going to quit or are quitting, then that's unfair to OP. \n\nI will say that with your new reply that yes, the whole ticket scenario did end up being something ugly, though is it controlling? OP said in the post that they are already taking them to one event a year and with that information, we can assume that there are at least some events previous to this in which OP has invited other people to go with them rather than her SO(maybe not because of smoking but is still normal behavior) I'd say it would be controlling if they were depriving their SO of a necessity, something that is their SO's property, or even by threatening to leave if they don't get sober.   \n\n\nThe whole thing about the tickets being OP's property and something they earn at their job means that OP has total control over who they invite. If OP doesn't want to bring their SO, and SO gets mad, then that means SO feels entitled to the tickets. Take my situation for example. My fiance and her family have allowed me to live in their home rent free. They have a couple rules. I can't smoke weed in the house(so I don't, I smoke outside), If I have a job, then I am responsible for buying my own groceries(if I do not, they buy them for me), and some others I can't remember rn but that's the difference between being supportive and a safety net for your loved one without controlling them. I never feel entitled to the support they give me and if it should stop for some reason or another, I would understand and not throw a fit about how it's not fair. If the SO agreed to the terms and still wanted to go, then they could have tried to at least partially fund their own ticket so they can show how they're taking responsibility over their actions and not expecting OP to fold anytime quitting doesn't work out.   \n\n\nThe ticket situation ending with the SO not making any progress can end with OP being supportive, enabling, or both.  \nIf they wanted to be emotionally supportive, they would have told the SO that quitting is hard and takes time, not blame them over not being able to make progress, and continue to love them regardless.  \n\n\nIf OP wanted to enable their SO's behavior, they would have said its ok and given them the ticket anyway, letting them know there are no consequences to their actions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf OP wanted to do both, they would have done both of the above. The problem is that OP is put in a tough situation in which their SO does not have anyone outside of OP to help them quit or talk to about quitting so OP is left with the responsibility of helping them stay accountable. It's a shitty situation and position to be in but OP did what was right when it comes to accountability. The problem is that OP shouldn't be the one to keep him accountable.   \n\n\nIf the SO had a sponsor or a close friend who could help keep them accountable, then OP could focus on just being emotional support, keep giving them the tickets no matter the SO's fluctuation in recovery.

He needs to put in the work himself, and it's exhausting and stressful. What you can do is be there for him for emotional support.

He's probably feeling guilty already for not making progress on quitting, and disinviting him to an event just makes that worse because now he's disappointing you. \n\nI think you have good intentions here, but this isn't the way to handle addiction.

But the one event per year limit for a long as he smokes sounds like you just arbitrarily added that after the fact.  \n\nAlso, if you\u2019ve been taking him to events but now won\u2019t because of smoking, then that\u2019s not a prize for quitting. That\u2019s a punishment for not quitting. If that were effective, there\u2019d be a lot less smokers now.

Find some nicotine quitting program, support group, counseling or whatever and tell him you\u2019ll start taking him again if he goes to one meeting. If he decides it\u2019s not for him or the program doesn\u2019t work, you won\u2019t punish him.

Instead of encouraging him to quit smoking, encourage him to do something that might enable him to quit smoking: enter a nicotine quitting program (they have virtual ones as well as local, try the patch, talk to his doctor about getting a prescription for a medicine that helps like Chantix, joining a support group.

That was over 30 years ago.\n\nAgain, it's REALLY hard to do because it's both a physical and psychological addiction, and smokers are filled with excuses about why they cannot quit. But today there are more supports for quitting than there were when my spouse, parents, sibling and I all quit in the 1980s and 1990s - you can get Nicorette gum without a prescription, and Nicorette helps a lot (back then it was prescription-only so most of us quit without it). \n\nTell him to get some Nicorette and start there. And then with the help of Nicorette he can either go for it cold turkey or reduce his cigarette smoking by one cigarette a day until he gets there, but he CAN do this if he really wants to do it. It's a question of really wanting to do it - does he want his cigarettes more than he wants special event tickets? More than he wants you? More than he wants to be able to breathe without an O2 cannister down the road?\n\nYou are NTA at all for pushing him to quit and tying high-value rewards to meaningful efforts to quit.

But for me to assume that they aren't making an effort would be presumptuous. And honestly, I've worked with clients that I even recommended AGAINST trying to quit at that time. This is because most people use smoking to meet a need. Many use it to cope with stress and anxieties. Some use it as a hobby and they have no other leisure skills. Some people use it to facilitate social interaction, and struggle to do so without it. Etc etc. Until you find other ways to meet the need that smoking is meeting, you are more than likely going to struggle. And none of that is even to mention the physical aspects of addiction and the fact that quitting doesn't just invoke mental discomfort (craving), but for people who have smoked for a long time or smoke a lot, they often get physically sick if they stop too quickly (headaches, nausea, racing heart, etc). \n\nAll of this is to say, that while I feel like you should hold him to the deal he made, and that what you do with your tickets is your choice, I think that if you really want to support him in quitting, y'all should have a talk about drives his smoking in the first place, encourage him to figure out ways to satisfy that drive first, then encourage him to start cutting down slowly. \n\nGood luck to y'all.", "10+ years meaning you knew he was a smoker when you started dating him, if you weren\u2019t okay with it then you shouldn\u2019t have dated him.

Once things got serious, she asked me to quit cigarettes (I smoked spliffs as well, she didn\u2019t mind those at the time). I cold turkeyed that day.

The thing that stuck out to him was pointing out that he smells badly bc of the smoke. He honestly didn't think anyone could smell it bc he smoked outdoors. One of our friends who is kind of blunt pointed it out to him and it really seemed to click. He asked me how I felt about it and I told him the truth: he smells like smoke and I don't like how it stinks up the bed and it makes me less attracted to him and worried about his health, too. Girl his gma died of effing lung cancer, we were there for the whole thing, and that wasn't enough. \n\nAnyway, he's stubborn and not a fan of meds but finally decided to try the patch. It worked really well for him!

He didn't quit, so there is no celebration to be had (by either of you)\n\nYou probably shouldn't try to tie any future events to an attempt to quit smoking unless you are willing to go through this again.\n\nA reward for quitting smoking should be something that you control. For example, if he quits then at the 6 month mark you will start planning to go to X or do Y. Don't make reservations until he actually achieves his goal. That way you are not missing things because of his smoking but you are waiting to do something until he quits.\n\nBefore any of that, though, sit him down for a conversation. Tell him you need to know if he actually wants to quit smoking. You probably shouldn't offer any incentives unless he actually wants to quit smoking. If he doesn't want to quit now, tell him to let you know when he is ready to quit.\n\nAs for methods, I had an ex who used nicotine patches. My grandmother just quit cold turkey. I don't think I know anyone else who quit - or at least I don't know how anyone else quit.", "This is the answer.\n\nMy husband smoked when I met him. I choose to continue the relationship, get more serious, marry and have a child with him, even though he smoked the whole time.  Every time he wanted to quit, I supported him wholeheartedly, I did everything I could to help him, but I never spoke down or condemned him for it. He tried quitting several times, even was successful for 3-4 month blocks but then would get sucked back in. And it was really hard to deal with sometimes, when we had a baby and he would get to go out back from 10-15 minutes while I dealt with diapers, it could feel frustrating (although he was so helpful and supportive in every way, the smoke breaks still irritated me sometimes). But I knew that he was a smokerwhen I met him, I knew lots of people never stop smoking, and that being with him was a choice I made so I didn't try to change it.\n\nAnd then, he finally quit for the last time. He used Zyn pouches for a year or so and then stopped those too. It has been like 5 years at this point. Sometimes he gets a craving, and we talk about it and work through it, because he trusts that I don't think less of him for the addiction. Want to know the thing that really really got him to commit to quitting and never going back? Life insurance. If he could quit for a year, he could get term life insurance for significantly less.

Managed to quit for two months during breastfeeding thanks to a hypnose session, but I still wasn't ready. Then last Christmas (by then 18 years a smoker) I get hit by a pretty bad sinus infection. Only smoke three over the course of a week. By then I am like: it would suck so bad to go back to my 12 a day. So I smoke my last cigarette on NYE, and head to a vape shop on Monday. I ALWAYS wondered what the hell was the point with vaping. But I got great advice from the dude there who was also an ex-smoker, he sold me a $30 e-cig with 10mg nicotine liquid with an actual taste of tobacco, and I still haven't smoked  5 months later. So I am not encouraging anyone to start vaping just for the heck of it, but if you are looking to quit smoking, I don't think there is a better alternative. We don't have great data on the lasting impacts, but at least you are not burning 4000+ cancer-inducing substances into your lungs. The nicotine helped me actually sleep (turns out nicotine depravation induces insomnia, fun!), and I am reducing progressively. If your body is already nicotine-free but you miss the smoking so bad you might actually relapse, I think vaping (0 nicotine) could be a great help. I am on my porch having a beer and throwing my dog the ball, and if it weren't for vaping, I'd be smoking. So it's not perfect, but for somebody who didn't actually mean to quit it's a pretty big win.", "You might want to read the book The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg.
