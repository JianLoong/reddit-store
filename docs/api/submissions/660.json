We've been doing the wedding planning, got places and things picked out, its been going good until we hit this snag. Abby is Jessica's best friend and maid of honor. Both love dogs, they both have dogs. When we started talking about the wedding Jessica told me all about this plan they both had that when each of them got married, they'd have doggy wedding ceremony between their dogs and their future husband's dogs at the same time. I don't have a dog, not a dog guy, so there is no potential for that to happen. I like her dog enough and let her do what she will with him, and I do get him treats and toys sometimes. I thought that would be the last I heard of that.\n\nShe and Abby started to talk about how cute it would be to include both of their dogs in our wedding party. Not my thing, but I have friends and family that have done something similar and I want her to enjoy the day so I said okay thinking they'd just be up at the alter or something like that. Nope. They want their dogs to get \\*married\\* during our wedding. I wasn't too keen on the idea and raised concerns like what would they do with both dogs for the rest of the day? What if the venue we picked doesn't allow pets? We went back and forth and I agreed that they could do their dog ceremony at the end of our ceremony. Couple weeks later Jessica and Abby bring it up again- they want parts of the reception to be dedicated to their dogs \\*friendship\\*. Shit like puppy picture slideshow, a cake for them, dog-friendly favor bags because they want their friends and her family to bring their dogs too.\n\nI told them no and that I already made one compromise on the issue and don't want a bunch of dogs around for our entire wedding and reception and that if they did that, we'd have to find an all-new venue probably. I reminded her that she was near the limit of what she could contribute toward our wedding funds and I'd be paying the rest, and I don't want to pay extra for stuff for a bunch of dogs. They both said that this was really important to them so I told Jessica point blank- We can stick to what we originally agreed to, or she and Abby could have their costly party that allows dogs by themselves and we'd just get married at the courthouse by ourselves.\n\nAbby told Jessica I was being manipulative and making ultimatums and wanted her to go stay at her place until 'OP pulls his head out of his ass'. Jessica didn't go but we're still going back and forth. She still wants things her way and feels I'm being too selfish. I don't think I am because I want an enjoyable wedding and marriage with Jessica- not Jessica and Abby and their pets.

That\u2019s such bizarre overstepping and the fact that your fianc\u00e9e doesn\u2019t see that is really concerning.

And Jessica is talking about taking so much time out of a day celebrating her commitment to spending her life with you to celebrate her friendship with Abby via their dogs. That's...not the point of a wedding? And what about the guests who don't have dogs, are allergic to dogs, or are terrified of dogs? Are they less important guests?\n\nMost of the time, childhood dreams about our weddings don't come true.

I love my dog and I love my best friend but there's no way that my wedding to my partner is about my dog or my best friend. The day is about me and my partner.

Because I've never heard anything this bizarre before. Like if anything, this feels like a dog wedding and you just happen to also be getting married, since there's going to be a sldie show and a bunch of history about the dogs.

I feel like your fiance's friend is sticking her nose into this a little too much. This wedding absolutely isn't about her or her dog. I would understand if you had a dog and your fiance had a dog, but what is this obsession with her friend wanting to have such a big part in this? \n\nI think for this entire \"doggy wedding\" thing to happen on both weddings you would have to even befriend her future husband. What if you don't even like the guy? And why do you have to fund this doggy ceremony? Why doesn't her friend pay for her idea?\n\nI love dogs. All pets, actually.

I would talk to your fianc\u00e9e and  her alone, because it's not her best friends wedding, and let her know that you understand it is important to her that's why you are ok with the dogs being there. As for the other things they want, why don't they throw a dog centric bachelorette party, and that way it's the best friend that wants this that is helping foot the bill. Everyone can invite their dogs and have a grand ole time. But not at your wedding.", "NTA, even if badly expressed, you were pushed to it. Is Abby going to insist on moving in with you as well, since your dogs are now 'married'? I'm half inclined to believe that's the endgame here.\n\nYou need to talk to your fiancee about this, seriously, as befits having identified a major problem in your relationship. This is no longer about the actual logistics of the wedding, it's about whatever is underpinning this bizarre shared delusion with Abby.", "NTA.

Also, most venues for weddings are not willing to accommodate for a dog wedding.  Just think of the amount of shedding and drool and whatever else.  Potential dog hair un the food.  Doggy accidents on the dance floor.  \n\nAlso, wedding receptions often have a band or DJ and they can be loud and unpleasant for dog's hearing.\n\nWho is going to do poop clean up for all this?\n\nI also do the venue maintenance work.

I own and love dogs as much as the next guy but what the hell?", "NTA, but I\u2019d ask Jessica if she really wants have a wedding with me or just a dog wedding, because she can\u2019t have both.

It's not an unreasonable ultimatum to make.", "NTA\n\nSomeone is being manipulative and it\u2019s not you OP. So many comments are trying to point out your failure to compromise when you already agreed to let them include the dogs. Their dog wedding doesn\u2019t need to happen on the same day as your actual wedding. It\u2019s something they can pay for together.", "NTA. This is absolutely bizarre enough I would start rethinking the relationship.", "Nta this is one of the stupidest things I\u2019ve heard for a wedding and it the bar is low", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not a wedding between them, it\u2019s a wedding between the two of you.

Especially after Abby demanded that Jessica leave OP to stay with her over OP not giving in to their dog-wedding taking over the supposed *actual* wedding. Has Abby shown any jealousy over your relationship? Intrusive in other ways?", "NTA. You already seem to understand compromising and it\u2019s about time your fianc\u00e9 learned it as well. Otherwise, your marriage is going to be a not so fun battlefield. This is a great time to reflect on your relationship over the years and see if her unwillingness to compromise has popped up before. Brides can face this tendency to assume the wedding is all about them when it\u2019s both of you. You aren\u2019t being unreasonable in the slightest. I love my dog but even I wouldn\u2019t want her at my wedding lol my husband and I did video a wedding a few weeks back though where they had their dog there and he just followed them around.

It sounds to me like Abby is using the dog issue to muscle her way into making the wedding partially about her.  It really sucks that your fianc\u00e9e is so uncaring about all of this.\nNTA at all, and the fact that you would have to give up your wedding day memory over this is just crazy!

It was a warm summer morning, the chapel had no A/C in 1980, the door was open, and a neighborhood cat wandered in during the ceremony.

Her and her friend are mad in love with each other and their dogs is what we all got from this.", "You are NTA. Honestly, I think what Jessica is demanding is rude and inconsiderate for a number of reasons. Who on earth turns their wedding day over to the dogs? Or their Maid of Honor?\n\nIf Abby and Jessica want to have a dog wedding ceremony they should pool their money together and throw one, invite all their friends with dogs, make doggy party favors and have a great time.  \n\nI have critters, they are members of my family and I treat them as such, but I don't go around forcing them on others because they are the cutest, sweetest fluffballs ever. The last place I would have any of them is at a wedding, as much for my sanity as for theirs. Especially my dogs. \n\nThe thought of having random dogs running around during the ceremony. OMG the potential for disaster...  Are they going to hire a pet sitter to take care of them while they are eating, drinking and dancing?  Or are the dogs invited to sit at the table? Will they hire a professional poop scooper to go around cleaning up the inevitable messes?  Other possibilities: a dog lifts a leg on Jessica's wedding dress, dives through the wedding cake, fights with another dog, knocks over grandma or Aunt Lucy while roughhousing, bites someone just because being in crowds gets it too excited. \n\nTo top it off, Jessica is totally ignoring the guests attending the wedding who may not feel comfortable around dogs for whatever reason.  Allergies, fear of being toppled, or just plain fear of dogs.  My MIL loves dogs but she is unsteady so we have to put our dogs in until she's seated because they will knock her down without even trying. Inconsiderate of Jessica to think everyone wants to be surrounded by dogs at a wedding. \n\nAs for ultimatums, what the hell does Jessica think she's making here? If Abby wants to do this at her wedding and her groom agrees, great! Go for it! But that's not the case here.

Been there, done that, seen it happen to others.\n\nThe decision is Jessica's: is this your wedding or is it Abby's and Jessica's dog's wedding day? Is it about the future of your partnership or about her friendship with Abby? I hope she chooses wisely.
