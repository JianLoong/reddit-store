She just always wants to prove she's better than me at something. Whether it was games on the playground or grades. She always had to prove she was better. This issue revolves around writing, which she didn't like until she saw me like it. \n\nWhen I was a senior in college and she was a freshman, I started a blog. I eventually gained 2K followers and got small brand deals and PR stuff. All throughout HS writing seemed to stress her out, and she then decided to major in English. (of course because I'm in communications) All of a sudden her freshman year of college she decides she loves to write. At the time she said it was because she realized that she was a better writer than she thought because the ideas in her classes challenged her more and interested her. But really, it's because there was almost no structure or formula to how she had to write, anyone can be a good writer when you don't have rules to follow.\n\nAnyway it was convenient that as soon as she saw me getting successful, suddenly she loves writing and it's all she does. She never got into blogging but presented papers at writing events and academic stuff (symposium or conference or whatever). She also got her Master in writing and is about to get a PhD. Suddenly the family pays attention to her work which is again an example of her needing to prove she's better than me. She presented at some big conference last year, was invited back this year, which of course my family things is SO impressive (meanwhile I studied abroad and only got told how nice it was that I had the opportunity). The real joke of it is that she only ever publishes articles and chapters in books, she apparently can't write a book herself. \n\nWe're all in town this weekend for the holiday and she spent a lot of time holed up writing because she has another one of her articles due and instead of seeing it as rude, the family thinks it's cool and are excited. Meanwhile I got another PR deal for a company on my blog and only got told \"that's so nice.\" I'm making more impact in my work, but she gets all the recognition. And all of this started because she can't let me have my one thing that I can be the best at, as soon as she saw me succeeding she had to jump in and find a way to prove that she's better than me. \n\nWhen she came back from her hotel the family were aksing her about her dissertation that she's finally almost done with and ignored my PR deal. She said she's basically done and needs to edit and write acknowledgements. I said I hope she'd acknowledge her jealousy and competitiveness with me as the driving force behind her work. She just laughed and turned away and I said \"no seriously\" and she said \"it wouldn't be true.\" My family is now mad and calling ME jealous and apparently can't see that she only does things to compete with me and can't handle me having attention instead of her. They called me pathetic.

Maybe it started as a competition, but nobody gets a Master's and then a PhD because they are competitive. Are you seriously saying that she has spent past 10 years of her life doing something she hated just because you liked it and did it well enough to be successful at it? Sorry, I don't think so. \n\nMaybe it started that way, but you both have your achievements,which are very different. Yours seems more lifestyle casual and hers seems more academic. The fact that she is writing \"chapters\" seems to indicate so. Also. Please pick up academic books in college. They are filled with multiple authors, who write either chapters or sections. Not many people write academic books in its entirety. \n\nIt sucks that your family can't see your achievements and appreciate it, but doesn't look like your cousins fault. Many families don't understand the blogging as career and can't see it as an achievements. Please have a talk with your family and at the same time self-reflect why your cousin's achievements are bothering you.", "YTA-She\u2019s not the one coming across as immature, jealous and competitive.", "YTA.  There's only one person is this story who is consumed with jealousy and competitiveness, and it's not your cousin.", "YTA. I started out like yeah, yeah, bc it did sound like she jumped on things to kinda copy you, but you\u2019ve taken it waaaay beyond that. She\u2019s not living her life at this point to compete with you, but it kinda sounds like you are. And you are constantly putting down her stuff and talking about how much better you are, but she sounds quite successful? And the family didn\u2019t ignore your PR deal. They just weren\u2019t as impressed with it as you wanted them to be. You sound kinda unhinged. So now I don\u2019t trust your earlier perspective on the situation with growing up.", "YTA - move on with your life and stop comparing your accomplishments to hers.", "YTA.  Look, I grew up with an unfairly gifted, charismatic cousin, too.  But when I reached adulthood, I realized she's not being awesome at everything she tries *at* me.  It's just who she is.  I can either resent that, or I can say, \"wow, congrats!\" and keep the conversation moving.  And if the rest of your family won't *let* the spotlight move on to other people, then maybe just focus on finding other people to spend your time with instead of expecting her to dim her light because you're not getting the appreciation you think you deserve.", "YTA. you are funny. its like you are what you think your cousin is. you did not invent writing.", "YTA She may have chosen writing because it was your thing, but it is obvious she realised quickly she had a real passion and gift for it. If she didn't she would have abandoned it. She has a degree, masters and now a soon to be PHD. She has left competitiveness a long long way down the road far in the past. She is damned good at what she does and her family has a right to be proud of her and that leaves a sour taste in your mouth. At this point you are being petty and jealous. I am the one in our house with a degree in creative writing, but it is my husband who has countless published articles. I am happy for him, not jealous. He worked hard and has a flair for it.", ">she apparently can't write a book herself. \n\nDid you write one? I thought you wrote a blog.\n\n\n>But really, it's because there was almost no structure or formula to how she had to write, anyone can be a good writer when you don't have rules to follow.\n\nThis is nonsense. It's way easier to follow instructions than being a real wordsmith.\n\nYou need to work on your jealousy. Where does your insecurity come from? Do you have unfulfilled dreams to work on?

From an outsider\u2019s  perspective you sound like the competitive and jealous one in this situation, not your cousin.  \n\nYou are both involved in very different areas of writing and have taken your own paths.  You are not in competition with each professionally. \n\nIf you are feeling like your family isn\u2019t giving you the recognition and support you deserve, then explain to them how it makes you feel.  I don\u2019t think can blame your cousin for this, nor should you expect her to change careers to make you feel better.", "INFO - what are some other examples of her being competitive and jealous? \n\nright now, it seems like YTA. i don't think someone would go as far as to get a PhD in writing just to prove their superiority. but either way, more information would be appreciated.", "YTA. It might have been a competition but it sounds like she\u2019s actually excelling in her field and getting a PHD is no joke.

She\u2019s leaving a lasting legacy in writing whether you like it or not. \n\nYou sound petty as hell.", "YTA. Ever think for a second she saw you as a role model and tried to emulate what you have achieved. Your successful and she\u2019s successful your just too immature to share a spotlight with someone.

Can\u2019t have it both ways.", "As someone else said, maybe she did initially get into writing to be competitive. Or maybe she saw your success and thought oh I should give that a shot.\n\nFor the sake of your own happiness I think you need to let go of any jealousy or resentment.\n\nI\u2019m getting g my PhD, and trust me it\u2019s not something anybody does for anyone other than themself. It\u2019s hard, so is a masters. It\u2019s just too much effort to do for the purpose of being spiteful.  Another way to think about things is that there is ALWAYS going to be someone better. In any career there is always somebody better than you. Focusing on that, and not celebrating your own accomplishments will make you miserable. Maybe try talking to your family about feeling under appreciated, that\u2019s valid, but not when your comparing yourself to your cousin.\n\nHell my sister got a masters in business from an Ivy League, I\u2019m getting a PhD in molecular biology at a top school. Have I gotten twinges of jealousy when she was praised and I wasn\u2019t to the same extent? Yes. Do I voice it or let it fester? No. We\u2019re on different paths, her success is hers and mine is mine.", "I\u2019m sorry\u2026are we gatekeeping writing now? I\u2019m a writer and I\u2019m 29.

Go to therapy for your jealousy and maybe be happy for your cousin that\u2019s worked incredibly hard in her field and will be completing her doctorate. Of which you don\u2019t have. You need to do some real soul-searching and inner healing. Wow. YTA.", "YTA. \n\nSo two people can't enjoy writing at the same time? Not to mention, writing a blog and academic writing are *completely* different beasts. Interesting that you say\n\n>anyone can be a good writer when you don't have rules to follow \n\nYet academic writing is incredibly rigorous and structured.

It is possible to be happy for your cousin without feeling threatened by her success.", "YTA. If this is a serious post, it's pretty obvious that the jealous one is you.

You are of a similar age, and making life's discoveries at roughly the same time. Of course you are both going to have milestones and events happening one after the other.

She's clearly doing exciting things and it seems like you're insanely jealous and have held onto this for YEARS while she's move on to much bigger and more meaningful things.

There is no rational reason to assume that, more than a decade out of high school, \u201cshe only does things to compete with me.\u201d\n\nI do understand your annoyance at your family being more impressed with her achievements than yours.

Well, it has been what? 8 years since that happened, and since then she has proven that she is a good writer and has had success in doing so. So what might have started out as a competition has revealed a real talent and career for her. That's great!\n\nThere's nothing in your story about her being jealous. You are the only one that comes across that way. You put her down for not writing a full book, yet you write a blog, which isn't even a chapter of a book. I don't think there is anything wrong with a blog, but I also wouldn't put someone down for writing a paper or chapter of a bigger work. \n\nYou put her down at every opportunity, but also are hurt your family doesn't point out your successes more or celebrate you.

Do you really think every time she accomplishes something she immediately thinks that it'll show you? I'm betting she doesn't.  You are not the main character in her life.  Hell you've made it so that you're not even the main character in your own life.  You're too damn focused on your cousin.  And tearing someone down won't make you shine any brighter.  The fact that you even asked her to take a break from some things is kinda pathetic.  YTA", "No one has to make themselves smaller to make you feel bigger. You'll have to grow.", "Sorry to hear this but you  do kind of sound like an AH.  Being competitive if you don't  rub it in is what is driving her to her awards.  \n\nHere's the thing...to a lot of older people, social media isn't  a real job.  So while I know you put in a ton of work, academic success is FAR more impressive in their eyes.\n\nSo, take a page out of Steven Kings Playbook.   You are likely to grow significantly more revenue than her....let the Financials do the talking.", "It doesn't sound like she was ever jealous of you, even as a child. She was better. Why would she be jealous?\n\nI am sure it was hard watching someone out perform you over and over. Some people are very motivated and thrive when they have a goal.  \n\nI don't know if being better than you was her goal or if her goals were separate from your achievements entirely. It is for sure not the case now and you need to let this go for your own happiness.", "You need help. Seriously. The amount of mental gymnastics you are doing here is fucking Olympic. \n\nThat being said, I doubt a therapist would touch you with a ten foot pole.", "So you were mad as a kid that a participant in a race actually tried to win said race??? You have beef with her because she wanted good grades and got the help she needed to get them?\n\nWere you by chance a gifted student that peaked in high school???", "Damn, you sound so selfish and self absorbed. You want her to put her life on hold so that you can do something something", "Sweet baby jeebus you need a damn therapist. YTA and you become a bigger and bigger AH with every comment you post.", "Who has presented papers at conferences and done so well to be invited back.", "Yeah, in my experience, communications majors are a joke. It\u2019s the easy option jocks and non-serious people go for. OP is just jealous her cousin achieved more academically and professionally. Definitely YTA.", "This needs to be higher up, I was waiting to see this pointed out.", "Oh, I absolutely love my cousin, and my mom and uncle and can shove their little competition as far as we are BOTH concerned. She\u2019s amazing, and I\u2019m proud of her, and I\u2019m totally proud of my things, too.", "Doubt she looks up to OP now\u2026", "Not from her career. I never asked her to stop teaching and stop writing her final. But all the extra presenting and travelling and such is icing on the cake and I feel like it's high time she can finally let me have some icing instead of inhaling it all for herself.", "Well according to her I had nothing to do with her liking writing which I call BS on. Who decides randomly to get into writing like two months after their family member does if they're not just blatantly copying them?", "Let me give an analogy...let's say A is into gaming and becomes one of the top esports people in the country.  B becomes a mediocre orthopedic surgeon.\n\nA is more well known nationally albeit within a niche crowd and makes 2x as much as B.\n\nI will bet the majority of parents of adults will be excited to introduce  their DOCTOR child....and their other child plays games for a living.", "Just an FYI social media isn't my job. I work in PR marketing I do this on the side", "I was going to say that, but I was trying not to open that can of worms. Comm. was a joke major at my top 30 university. It was mainly for the lazy rich kids who already had a job lined up by mom and dad. We had an awesome business/finance program. A lot of the kids that were too lazy or dumb to get into B school ended up being comm majors.", "In higher academia, it's publish or perish. The follow-up of publishing is presenting. They go hand in hand. You were asking her to self sabotage", "This isn't a zero sum game. She has no obligation to dim her own accomplishments to make you look better.", "It\u2019s only a competition because you are making  it one. Stop asking her to let her light dim because you\u2019re too insecure or immature to realize her being successful doesn\u2019t prevent you from being successful too.", "It sounds like she\u2019s an aspiring academic. IT IS LITERALLY HER JOB TO WRITE, PUBLISH, & PRESENT. It\u2019s called scholarship and is required for promotion and tenure. The fact that she\u2019s doing so much before she finishes her phd makes her an appealing candidate for limited tenure track jobs.\n\nAs a fellow academic, I want to tell you that she is NOT MOTIVATED by competing with your blog. This is not the same thing at all. You sound insanely jealous. \n\nI genuinely mean this kindly\u2026seek therapy.", "You are in the weeds on this. What you asked her to do so you could shine is completely unacceptable and frankly kind of nuts. Maybe you just need to do something that warrants accolades or a reason for your family to spoil you with praise. You need to stop wanting high praise for a participation trophy while she is out there actually winning. Life and happiness isn\u2019t a competition.", "OMFg. \n\nReally?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair you are so good that YOU GET ALL THE ATTENTION, be less good so I can get some\u201d is so full of crap, it\u2019s a manure factory. GTFO with that.", "Wow you're sad. \n\nNewsflash - she is better than you, and she's more successful. You're a minor blogger, on the side of a regular PR job, with some minor success. Nothing that amazing. She's getting a doctorate, travels presenting, is highly published (professionally so), and is just being recognised for her commitment and hard work. \n\nShe's not jealous of you, she has no need to be, and her laughing at your ridiculous jealous behaviour is fully deserved.", "Someone who found out that they enjoy writing when it\u2019s less restrictive does that. Stop assuming it\u2019s all about you.", "That's just factually false though.  You were in your 4th year of a 4 year program.  She discovered a love of writing in her freshman year.\n\nThe world doesn't revolve around you.  She's successful in the field.  She must have a genuine passion for it.  \n\nYou sound extraordinarily jealous.  And petty.", "\"Who decides randomly to get into writing like two months after their family member does if they're not just blatantly copying them?\"\n\nLots of people, actually. My daughter started writing after I did. She loved to read and decided to write when I showed her that it was okay and fun to try. It seems to me that you are confusing causation and correlation, OP. The fact that your cousin developed a love of writing two months after you did does not mean your interest directly or even indirectly caused her own. It most certainly doesn't mean that the follow-on years of perseverance and hard work she put into what she learned to love has anything to do with you- your careers have taken completely different paths. \n\nI would strongly recommend you examine your tendency to see everything you do in relation to your cousin with a competent therapist; it truly isn't healthy. Live your life; let your cousin live hers and stop being so jealous. Her life is not about you. YTA.", "And? It was 10 years ago. Move on. You're the only one being stuck in the past. She didnt steal your work or your job. Damn, you're petty.", "Are you American? If so, she might have figured out her passion for writing through the core classes or general electives. \n\nYTA btw", "A lot of people actually. I hated school writing absolutely hated it. A friend told me she liked writing on her own time and I tried that and ended up loving it. All of your comments sound like the only one with a problem is you. It sounds like your cousin tried to give writing another chance MAYBE seeing how much you enjoyed it but as someone else said all this work would not be done out of spite. It\u2019s unfortunate but her accomplishments are worthy of attention not to say yours aren\u2019t but if you are begging for validation as much as you are on here maybe that\u2019s the issue on why no acknowledges you", "Why do you need credit?", "As a published writer, I freaking love it when friends or relatives start working on their own stuff and try to get their thoughts out into the world instead of just sitting on those ideas. Why would someone else's interest or success in the field have a negative impact on me?\n\nThen again, I write because I love it, and I'd write for the rest of my life even if I wasn't sharing my work. Honestly, it sounds like you're more into recognition and back-pats than the work itself, which may be why you can't understand why asking her to chill is so offensive.", "Well considering you're genetically related, yes it is normal to have similar interests and excel at similar activities (Well she excels, you have a barely read blog, but you get my gist)", "So you do blogging on the side, she does academic writing as her career. It\u2019s not that surprising that she\u2019s getting more attention in that case. She\u2019s getting 2 higher education degrees for what she does. Yes blogging is work but surely you can appreciate that in all she\u2019s working harder on her writing career than you are on your blogging.", "Sounded like that was your primary gig.  In any case, unless you are in the news nationally it still seems like a  more 'normal' job.  So maybe not as extreme as what I thought, same effect. \n\nSome people put huge value on academic work, and professional recognition is big.  Some others deride academia.", "As someone who also works in PR, I have to say you are doing a pretty piss poor job at presenting yourself. You come off as jealous, bitter, spiteful and obsessed. It is not very becoming, especially at your big age. \n\nYTA.", "I understand pressure to publish, they told me as much as when I was in college. But she isn't going to literally lose her PhD if she just calms down for a bit. I don't see her as having one less presentation, chapter, whatever as her being in danger of sabotage for herself.", "How dare a college freshman pick a career path! Was op expecting her to check in weekly to ensure that she had nothing in common with OP? Like does she have to have a calendar of OPs life to avoid everything?", "Exactly! My little neighbour dude downstairs started writing little stories when he found out that's what I did for a living at the time. I think maybe he didn't know you could write professionally or maybe he just hadn't tried to show anyone before but all of a sudden a month after I moved in, there he is wanting me to read his stories.", "You\u2019re the jealous one. Not her. She sounds like a disciplined person who works hard to be successful. Also, if you\u2019re that much older than her, why were you in the same classes. As a high school senior I had no classes with freshmen/sophomores.", "Sure, she won\u2019t lose her PhD but she will be slowing down her success and career. Papers, book chapters, presentations are all getting her more well known in her field, which at her level is competitive. It\u2019s just not reasonable for you to ask her to turn away opportunities when they don\u2019t negatively affect you at all", "You're out of your bloody mind. You're beyond an asshole.", "Umm.. look, I'm a science person so failing to publish might not mean losing your PhD, but it'll certainly mean losing grants aka.. your paycheck, your funding to do the research. So I dont know much about the writing feild, but your are litterally asking her to TANK her career", "Why should she have to jeopardize her career?  So you can feel special for 10 minutes?  Find comfort in your own worth. Your jealousy is out of this world. YTA.", "One less chapter or conference paper could be the difference in where she is hired once she has her PhD. Why should she stop doing what she loves so you can shine? I hate to break it to you, but she\u2019s not the over-competetive one here. Stop self-sabotaging and live your damn life", "That\u2019s not how academia works.", "You want her to put her life on hold for your ego. That\u2019s sad", "We weren't in the same classes I was taking them years before. Hence why she knew what grades I had in order to do better.", "Or, you know, she just tried to get the best grade she could, and it was always more than yours. Sounds like you were a B student?", "I don\u2019t understand why you care so much about irrelevant stuff like this?  You\u2019re so bitter.", "Sorry but that makes even less sense. Did you share what grades you got with her? How would she know what grades you got years prior?", "Bs and Cs which is pretty in line with a lot of people in the family, and in fact a lot of people were getting Cs and Ds. She's the one who had to always get straight As. I was the first smart one and then she insisted on doing everything she could to make sure she was better than me even if it was just one percent point. We are the only two who went to college and she's been trying to insure that she is remembered as the ultimate smarter one.", "It was normal for our family to go out to dinner as a big group whenever we got report cards so my freshman year when i did well we were all at dinner and i had my report card with me grades and all."]}
