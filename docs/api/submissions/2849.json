{"id": 2849, "submission_id": "z0dagu", "title": "AITA for pointing out my cousin's jealousy and competitive nature?", "selftext": "I'm 31F cousin is 28F. \n\nShe has always been competitive with me. She just always wants to prove she's better than me at something. Whether it was games on the playground or grades. She always had to prove she was better. This issue revolves around writing, which she didn't like until she saw me like it. \n\nWhen I was a senior in college and she was a freshman, I started a blog. I eventually gained 2K followers and got small brand deals and PR stuff. All throughout HS writing seemed to stress her out, and she then decided to major in English. (of course because I'm in communications) All of a sudden her freshman year of college she decides she loves to write. At the time she said it was because she realized that she was a better writer than she thought because the ideas in her classes challenged her more and interested her. But really, it's because there was almost no structure or formula to how she had to write, anyone can be a good writer when you don't have rules to follow.\n\nAnyway it was convenient that as soon as she saw me getting successful, suddenly she loves writing and it's all she does. She never got into blogging but presented papers at writing events and academic stuff (symposium or conference or whatever). She also got her Master in writing and is about to get a PhD. Suddenly the family pays attention to her work which is again an example of her needing to prove she's better than me. She presented at some big conference last year, was invited back this year, which of course my family things is SO impressive (meanwhile I studied abroad and only got told how nice it was that I had the opportunity). The real joke of it is that she only ever publishes articles and chapters in books, she apparently can't write a book herself. \n\nWe're all in town this weekend for the holiday and she spent a lot of time holed up writing because she has another one of her articles due and instead of seeing it as rude, the family thinks it's cool and are excited. Meanwhile I got another PR deal for a company on my blog and only got told \"that's so nice.\" I'm making more impact in my work, but she gets all the recognition. And all of this started because she can't let me have my one thing that I can be the best at, as soon as she saw me succeeding she had to jump in and find a way to prove that she's better than me. \n\nWhen she came back from her hotel the family were aksing her about her dissertation that she's finally almost done with and ignored my PR deal. She said she's basically done and needs to edit and write acknowledgements. I said I hope she'd acknowledge her jealousy and competitiveness with me as the driving force behind her work. She just laughed and turned away and I said \"no seriously\" and she said \"it wouldn't be true.\" My family is now mad and calling ME jealous and apparently can't see that she only does things to compete with me and can't handle me having attention instead of her. They called me pathetic.

Maybe it started as a competition, but nobody gets a Master's and then a PhD because they are competitive. Are you seriously saying that she has spent past 10 years of her life doing something she hated just because you liked it and did it well enough to be successful at it? Sorry, I don't think so. \n\nMaybe it started that way, but you both have your achievements,which are very different. Yours seems more lifestyle casual and hers seems more academic. The fact that she is writing \"chapters\" seems to indicate so. Also. Please pick up academic books in college. They are filled with multiple authors, who write either chapters or sections. Not many people write academic books in its entirety. \n\nIt sucks that your family can't see your achievements and appreciate it, but doesn't look like your cousins fault. Many families don't understand the blogging as career and can't see it as an achievements.

Look, I grew up with an unfairly gifted, charismatic cousin, too.  But when I reached adulthood, I realized she's not being awesome at everything she tries *at* me.  It's just who she is.  I can either resent that, or I can say, \"wow, congrats!\" and keep the conversation moving.  And if the rest of your family won't *let* the spotlight move on to other people, then maybe just focus on finding other people to spend your time with instead of expecting her to dim her light because you're not getting the appreciation you think you deserve.", "YTA. you are funny. its like you are what you think your cousin is. you did not invent writing.", "YTA She may have chosen writing because it was your thing, but it is obvious she realised quickly she had a real passion and gift for it. If she didn't she would have abandoned it. She has a degree, masters and now a soon to be PHD. She has left competitiveness a long long way down the road far in the past. She is damned good at what she does and her family has a right to be proud of her and that leaves a sour taste in your mouth. At this point you are being petty and jealous.

It's way easier to follow instructions than being a real wordsmith.\n\nYou need to work on your jealousy. Where does your insecurity come from? Do you have unfulfilled dreams to work on?

It might have been a competition but it sounds like she\u2019s actually excelling in her field and getting a PHD is no joke.

It\u2019s hard, so is a masters. It\u2019s just too much effort to do for the purpose of being spiteful.  Another way to think about things is that there is ALWAYS going to be someone better. In any career there is always somebody better than you. Focusing on that, and not celebrating your own accomplishments will make you miserable. Maybe try talking to your family about feeling under appreciated, that\u2019s valid, but not when your comparing yourself to your cousin.\n\nHell my sister got a masters in business from an Ivy League, I\u2019m getting a PhD in molecular biology at a top school.

There is no rational reason to assume that, more than a decade out of high school, \u201cshe only does things to compete with me.\u201d\n\nI do understand your annoyance at your family being more impressed with her achievements than yours.

Well, it has been what? 8 years since that happened, and since then she has proven that she is a good writer and has had success in doing so. So what might have started out as a competition has revealed a real talent and career for her. That's great!\n\nThere's nothing in your story about her being jealous. You are the only one that comes across that way. You put her down for not writing a full book, yet you write a blog, which isn't even a chapter of a book. I don't think there is anything wrong with a blog, but I also wouldn't put someone down for writing a paper or chapter of a bigger work. \n\nYou put her down at every opportunity, but also are hurt your family doesn't point out your successes more or celebrate you.

Just because you started singing two months before her doesn't mean she needs to humble herself because you might have inspired her.\n\nLike, this cousin could be horribly competitive, and she probably is, but OP is so shrouded by her own jealousy that she can't even give a proper account of how the cousin is supposedly one upping her.\n\nI dislike \"one uppers\" immensely, but like...

I didn't like math in early grades, cause to me it was just calculations, in which I sucked (have diagnosed ADHD).

Like, I studied art history and a few years later my younger cousin chose to study architecture - it makes me really happy to think she decided to pick something creative too, and I hope that I helped influence her decision a bit :') I'm not taking credit for it though because she's her own person and it would be incredibly self centered to imagine myself as the central catalyst to all her life choices lmao........", "That was what got me.
