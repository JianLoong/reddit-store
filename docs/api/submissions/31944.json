Parents called the police", "selftext": "After TG break, I (25F) flew back home to TX where I'm working temporarily. My family's in GA. We spend holidays in AL so I had to drive back to GA, to catch my flight back to TX. I almost missed the flight because of Thanksgiving/Sunday traffic, and got back to TX pretty late; very stressful day of travel and running around. Because of this, I was extremely exhausted and decided to crash at my TX guy friend's house, where I park my car during my trips as he drives me to and from the airport. I let my family know when I landed and made it in last night and that was that. My parents don't necessarily know this guy because some guys just aren't worth disclosing to family. We\u2019ve dated before and have known each other for a few years. Well I woke up the next morning around 5am to tell my job I would be taking the day off. I rolled over and went back to sleep. I shut off alarms, and my phone was on silent and I missed a ton of calls from my family between 6am-10am.  My sister called me 25 times, parents called me 30 times each. Left several voicemails. I even had voicemails from TX police dept, and my supervisor that my parents were trying to get in touch with me. When I picked up to ask what was all the commotion about, my parents and sister are all on the phone \"why aren't you answering?! where are you because the police said your car is NOT outside your apartment!!\" I said I'm home safe, and sleeping. She demanded I send her a picture of my car actually outside of my apartment and that I'm not somewhere I \"have no business\". Now my family isn't speaking to me because they are so upset with me for scaring them, and not telling them I was over this guy's house. I have not heard from my parents or sister ever since this happened yesterday morning. My sister is upset with me because \"you didn't even tell anyone you knew anybody out there!\" \"nobody sleeps that hard/late\" \"you need to be more responsive to your phone\". On top of this, it has always bothered my family that I legit will sleep til 9/10am unless I have earlier obligations. I've always been a heavy sleeper and they give me crap about it all the time, although I\u2019ve never been late, am very responsible, and have never lost a job.  I just like sleeping in sometimes.  AITA for sleeping through their calls? for not telling them I was taking the day off to sleep in? They kept saying they thought I was somewhere dead and they were under the impression I didn't know anybody in TX. My mom is stonewalling me bc I guess I didn't disclose beforehand where I was that morning. Am I not entitled to the privacy or my own life or not over sharing every little thing at 25?\r  \nSummary: AITA for not answering the phone? Parents called my job and the police.\r  \nEdit: To all the \u201cwell you should\u2019ve told them you were going to stay at the friend\u2019s house\u201d. Think about all the stuff you did without thinking to alert your parents at 25. When my parents were 25, they didn\u2019t have the cellphones to let their parents know (who are in another state), their whereabouts.

Your parents and sister are insane.\n\nLet's start with one fact: **You are a grown-ass adult!**\n\nEverything else follows from that. You are allowed to sleep in. You are allowed to sleep over at a friend's house. (You are allowed to fuck them if you want!) You are allowed to take the day off at work. You are allowed to not answer your phone. Now, I do get that some people get all panicky after flights, but **you let your family know**. I mean, that was already above and beyond the call of duty.\n\nGiven this story, I have a hunch that your Mom is trying to control you in all sorts of ways. Let me reassure you: You are not the asshole here. And not only that, but you probably need to push back harder on all of the other shit she's pulling. She wouldn't be doing this crazy shit if you had been pushing back against her in the **seven years** since you became a legal adult.", "Wow. Just, wow. Are they all always up in your business like this? Does everyone have each other under a microscope? You told them that you landed safely and made it back, and that was all you really had to do. If my family CALLED MY BOSS to find me, I\u2019d be the one pretty pissed off tbh. \n\nNTA times a million and tell your mom to get therapy if she thinks stonewalling is in some way going to help your relationship. I understand your sister being worried that your car isn\u2019t at your apartment, but wow did she go from 0 to 100. Is there some specific reason we\u2019re missing here that they would be concerned about that? Or are they always jumping to the worst conclusions?\n\nTake some deep breaths, OP. Consider going LC or NC if you feel that you need some space from them.", "NTA. Your family seems very controlling and at the end of the day you\u2019re an adult. You can make your own decisions. If you\u2019re grown enough to make a journey that long you\u2019re grown enough to decide where you sleep. Calling the police because you weren\u2019t home was probably one of the biggest overreactions I\u2019ve seen in a while but then again I\u2019d be concerned if my child travelled a long while and I didn\u2019t hear from them. But that doesn\u2019t excuse their behaviour \u2764\ufe0f", "nta. it was four hours. idk why the cops even gave them the time of day. your family is not being normal concerned family, they\u2019re being creepy controlling invasive family, clearly illustrated by the demands for photos to prove you\u2019re somewhere they approve of you being. in future make sure your family do not have the contact info for your jobs, if you can, they are not people who can be trusted with that kind of access. \n\ndid they even need anything from you, or were they calling you in the early morning just for kicks?", "Things I would stop doing immediately:\n\n* telling your parents where you live. get a PO box.\n* telling your parents where you work. you have a job, you do x. that's enough information.\n* giving your parents any of your friends/lovers/acquaintances numbers\n* answering most of your family's calls\n\nThese people need to be on an information diet immediately. I'm going to be living pretty close to my parents for the first time as an adult, and they are good people who love me and dealt with me being a half day's drive away for 20 years, and I trust that they would not turn up while I was gone and snoop. I am still not giving them a key (I might hide one at their house, now that I'm thinking about it, but that's an emergency grab).\n\nNTA", "NTA - You're an adult, this is insane.\n\n\nFor curiosity's sake, what prompted all this in the first place?

You were out of contact for a few *hours* and they called the police. \n\nThey know you like to sleep late. But they don\u2019t like it so they called the police. \n\nThey know you landed safely, but didn\u2019t respond immediately in the morning so they called the police. \n\nThey called your work!! Who could have told them there were no concerns and they *still* called the police. \n\nAnd your sister thinks it\u2019s totally normal and defending them. I think a communication pause is called for. But you might wanna warn the cops about the barrage of wellness checks coming.", "NTA.\n\nYou're an adult, not a 12 year old that needs their location monitored at all times. Your family sounds really tiresome.", "I knew something was wrong with the dynamic when every single time I do something I wanna do, I feel guilty or that I'm \"gonna get in trouble\".  This is why I don't disclose everything anyway. I try to keep my personal life separate because I'm always scolded for something. I never bring up boys, etc. I'd rather literally wait until the guy has proposed to me than disclose anything too early, allowing room for judgement and control.  They'd blow my phone up to come home whenever I'm at my boyfriend's house. I had a curfew in general at 20-23 years old, etc.  that's when I saved my money and moved the heck out.", "NTA. Do you have any history of past behaviour or medical condition that would cause them to overreact like this? Do you normally respond to texts/calls instantaneously?", "NTA - why on earth were they so desperate to get ahold of you? You returned home safely the night before and you let them know. What if you had been at work? Do they expect you to answer 85 calls while at work?? You are 25 years old. They need to ground the helicopter already. And ffs they called the police and your supervisor? Whoa.", "NTA. And it might be time to have an 'I'm a grown adult and you need to get up off my dick' chat with them. Frankly, I hate the notion that just because my phone rings/my doorbell rings, I have to answer it. No, I don't. And sometimes, a lot of times, I just ignore it. Because I don't wanna talk. Them calling the cops over you not answering for x hours is bullshit and a huge overreaction and you need to blaze them over it. \"You keep doing this shit and I'm going to stop talking to you for a good long while, just because I'm angry. This is not okay. I'm an adult. You knew I got home okay. You don't get to dictate where I go/what I do/who I do it with, so stop. Otherwise I'm going to find a very good reason to change my number and tell the police that any wellness checks from family are bullshit.\"", "Your family needs to get a grip. You didn\u2019t answer your *phone* in the morning, and your parents called the *police* the same day, even though you let them know your plane landed safely the night before. W. T. F.\n\nOh, and they want you to *send them a picture of your car in your driveway!* to prove you *are* home, and not lying! How about, oh, hell no. \n\nAnd now they aren\u2019t talking to you? Hey, don\u2019t threaten you with a good time! NTA\n\nWhen your family wants to reestablish contact-and you know they *will*\u2026 Well, they need to be kept on a strict information diet.", "Your family seem ridiculously needy and also, it seems, moralizing and judgemental?\n\nYou're an adult; you had texted them to let them know you had landed safely; your obligations to them were at an end. The fact that they are checking if your car is outside your apartment (wtaf) is creepy and overstepping. I'd be mocking them for wasting police time, and putting them on a strict information diet for a while.", "NTA\n\n> She demanded I send her a picture of my car actually outside of my apartment and that I'm not somewhere I \"have no business\".\n\nNC. **Yesterday.**", "Uh, NTA. I don't even know why you would call the police because someone didn't answer your message for a couple of hours.", "NTA. I would expect this reaction if it had been days, not hours.", "One time I was talking to Mom on one of those old-timey phones that had cords plugged into the wall. My kitten started play-fighting with the cord and destroyed it, chewed through it, dropping the call. A minute later comes the frantic call on the old-timey answering machine. As I'm rushing out to the old-timey public pay phone down the street to calm her the hell down, the police roll up. She'd called them from several states away. They were amused.", "This is a HUGE overreaction by your family, who sound incredibly overbearing. NTA, you are absolutely entitled to privacy and a life of your own. And there is absolutely nothing wrong about sleeping in until 9 or 10.", "NTA\n\nHold fast to your boundaries. If you want to save a specific greeting to your phone, you might say that if they can't get through, you've probably turned the phone off. Don't let them guilt you. Instead, enjoy their silence as a holiday and don't try to get in touch. \n\nMy mother would give me the silent treatment whenever I was late getting to her house (no cellphone at the time). So once, after two flat tires, she wouldn't talk to me when I finally made it. I said, \"Well, I came to visit, but if you're not going to talk to me, I might as well leave.\" And I did, and didn't answer the phone for the rest of the day. She never did it again.\n\nGood luck.", "> where are you because the police said your car is NOT outside your apartment    \n    \nI find it hard to believe police would have done a drive-by of your apartment complex in the four hour period between 0600 and 1000 for a 25yo woman who had checked in as all good with her family 12 hours beforehand. What's the time difference between the first instance of them looking for you and their claim that they police said the car wasn't at your official residence? How long did they give you to respond before contacting the police, and how long is the period in which they're saying the police found you not to be at home?   \n    \nI would be highly concerned these people have placed a tracker on your car or phone and already knew you weren't at home. Your mother was looking for the photo of your location because she knew you couldn't provide it, to catch you in your lie without having to admit to her stalking.    \n    \nThis whole dynamic sounds really unhealthy, OP; someone should always know where you are in case you do have a problem, so lying to your family isn't great, but their behaviour here is bonkers and wouldn't encourage anyone to be honest. I think the reality is probably even more disturbing than is readily visible and they have spy software on something you own.\n    \nYou're not wrong for being incommunicado for a few hours, but I think you have a much bigger problem here, and you are going to have to find some way of making your family accept that they can't control and intrude on your life to this degree.    \n    \nNTA for the family stuff, but for the record, saying \"some guys just aren't worth disclosing to family\" about someone you stay over with who drives you to and from the airport *is* kind of an asshole thing to say.", "NTA. Your family needs to accept that you are an adult, and you don't cater to their neuroticism. \n\nMy mom didn't call the police on me, but she would always pull the \"If you don't call me constantly, I'll WORRY\" card on me. \n\nI would continue distancing myself from your family.", "nta your family is controlling you are a adult. don't give in to them setup boundaries", "NTA, your family is being super creepy.", "NTA. That was a huge over reaction by your family. You're a grown ass adult. It's none of their business where you sleep or who you sleep with.

This is wild behavior from them.", "NTA, but wow your family sure are.\n\nReduce contact to one scheduled, timed (say 20 minute) call a week. Provide minimal information about your personal life.

Make them agree that they they are to have no contact, period, with your employer or your friends.\n\nAny infraction or other, new kind of intrusion in your life reduces five minutes from the time of the phone call.

I almost missed the flight because of Thanksgiving/Sunday traffic, and got back to TX pretty late; very stressful day of travel and running around. Because of this, I was extremely exhausted and decided to crash at my TX guy friend's house, where I park my car during my trips as he drives me to and from the airport. I let my family know when I landed and made it in last night and that was that. My parents don't necessarily know this guy because some guys just aren't worth disclosing to family. We\u2019ve dated before and have known each other for a few years. Well I woke up the next morning around 5am to tell my job I would be taking the day off. I rolled over and went back to sleep. I shut off alarms, and my phone was on silent and I missed a ton of calls from my family between 6am-10am.  My sister called me 25 times, parents called me 30 times each. Left several voicemails. I even had voicemails from TX police dept, and my supervisor that my parents were trying to get in touch with me. When I picked up to ask what was all the commotion about, my parents and sister are all on the phone \"why aren't you answering?! where are you because the police said your car is NOT outside your apartment!!\" I said I'm home safe, and sleeping. She demanded I send her a picture of my car actually outside of my apartment and that I'm not somewhere I \"have no business\". Now my family isn't speaking to me because they are so upset with me for scaring them, and not telling them I was over this guy's house. I have not heard from my parents or sister ever since this happened yesterday morning. My sister is upset with me because \"you didn't even tell anyone you knew anybody out there!\" \"nobody sleeps that hard/late\" \"you need to be more responsive to your phone\". On top of this, it has always bothered my family that I legit will sleep til 9/10am unless I have earlier obligations. I've always been a heavy sleeper and they give me crap about it all the time, although I\u2019ve never been late, am very responsible, and have never lost a job.  I just like sleeping in sometimes.  AITA for sleeping through their calls? for not telling them I was taking the day off to sleep in? They kept saying they thought I was somewhere dead and they were under the impression I didn't know anybody in TX. My mom is stonewalling me bc I guess I didn't disclose beforehand where I was that morning. Am I not entitled to the privacy or my own life or not over sharing every little thing at 25?\r  \nSummary: AITA for not answering the phone? Parents called my job and the police.\r  \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If I were you, I'd do something like this:\n\n1. Decide not to answer the phone from them in the future. You live in another state. No matter how urgent their emergency is, you can't help from where you are anyway. If they text you, wait a minimum of half an hour to respond, with the goal of stretching that out to an hour or more. Turn off read receipts.\n2. Schedule a time every day to call them. Set an actual timer for 15 or 20 minutes, and when the timer goes off, tell them you have to go. You can eventually dial this down to simply 10 minutes per call, or even less.\n3. Once they've stopped calling you every morning, slowly start transitioning to calling them every other day, then three times a week, two times, and so on. Each time you hang up, tell them the next day you'll call. Eventually you'll hit a point where you're calling a *reasonable amount*.

This kinda behavior, without any valid reason like a history of benders or health problems...kinda only points towards two things:\n\n\n1. Your family seriously nuts. Like, certifiably nuts - schizophrenia, psychosis, paranoia, BPD, all of the above, who knows. This behavior is completely unhinged.\n\n2.

She\u2019s temporarily working in Texas so she doesn\u2019t know her way around all that well and doesn\u2019t have any local family or any friends out their that you\u2019ve met.

You wake up and realize you forgot to ask her something before she left so you give her a quick call at 6AM because she should still be at home getting ready for work.  No answer.  Weird because Western Tomorrow always answers her phone.  She can\u2019t put the damn thing down for two seconds.  Maybe she\u2019s sleeping in a bit.  I\u2019ll call back in 10 minutes.  \n\n\nCall back, no answer.  Weird.  So you text your other daughter.  Hey, did Western Tomorrow mention anything about not having work or something tomorrow, she\u2019s not answered the phone or returned my texts.  Sister says \u201cno, I\u2019ll try her, maybe your phone is messed up\u201d.  Sis texts and calls, no answer.  \n\n\nNow it\u2019s getting to the point that Western should be heading out the door to her job.  You and sis know for a fact that Western never leaves her house without her phone.  But still, no answer, no return text.

But she didn\u2019t mention to anyone at home that she were taking today off.  That\u2019s just so strange.  Now your trying to figure out any possible reason Western would be ignoring a call and text from you and sis.  \n\n\nSo you call boss again and say, \u201chey we can\u2019t get in touch with Western which just isn\u2019t like her and we don\u2019t really know anyone around the area, can you call her and let her know we are trying to reach her.\u201d  Boss calls you back, say \u201chuh, I called her too and didn\u2019t get an answer.  I\u2019ll let you know if I hear from her.\u201d\n\n\nNow you are spinning out.  All those episodes of 20/20, Dateline, 48 Hours are all flooding in.  You remember that the chances of finding a missing person drops tremendously every hour they are missing.

Ma\u2019am we called and left a message for your daughter.  We also checked the parking lot and no car matching hers was found.  We also knocked on the door and got no response.
