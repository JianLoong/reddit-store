I pulled him aside in private so his fighter wouldn\u2019t hear and asked for advice. I said I didn\u2019t want to cause drama. He said he would make a few phone calls and reassured me. \n\nLater that day, my dad called me and said that one of the guys (Jim) called him and asked for me to talk to him. Jim apparently told him that Dan said he wasn\u2019t trying to be sexual. I haven\u2019t had the courage to reach out to Jim. I feel stupid and embarrassed.

Idk I\u2019m closer to his age & it sounds like most on here are much younger so my opinion will probably differ - \nPersonally when someone tells me something like that I was younger and someone would say that to me I just told them something like \u2026.. thanks but you know you are way too old for me & if they respond w/something else I just said things I\u2019m too much for you to handle anyway so nope just keep on moving because I\u2019m not interested. I always tried to keep things light\u2026.. I don\u2019t see a reason to pi$$ someone off unless I have to & I may just need their help w/something one day. \nUsually just letting someone know your not interested then most will move on. If they don\u2019t then you just need to be firmer about it and say look you need to stop because it\u2019s making me feel uncomfortable and I don\u2019t want you to say things like that.

Idk if it\u2019s for attention or they just really don\u2019t know how to react. \nMaybe he was just sees you as close friends and didn\u2019t mean anything by it and was just trying to make you smile or maybe he\u2019s a perv idk but many ppl don\u2019t bother to stop and find out they just create a big issue out of it\u2026\u2026.

Jim is my dad\u2019s coworker. I\u2019m guessing the Ray called Jim (who helps manages the gym) to ask about the situation.

But he makes it a point to only ask me. He asked me only once when my boyfriend was there. \n\nDan has also very obviously stared at my chest. There was also another time when I had to shower at the gym (it has a singular locker room and shower so I locked it and secured a weight). I forgot to bring a new pair of clean clothes so I wore my gym shorts that I only wear if no one is there and I had a jacket on over top. I normally wear leggings and a tank top. He asked for my help when I tried to run out the gym and I felt bad if I said no. He said I needed to stand over top of him and throw a medicine ball at his stomach. We did this repeatedly for about 5 minutes and I was so thankful when it was done but I was terrified that he was looking up them. \n\nHe also would call me his girl and muscle girl but that was the tamest.", "Yeah that's what I thought too.

And as OP pointed out, he said \"your\" and not \"the.\" He was specifically referencing OP's body.\n\nAnd again, intent doesn't matter. It made OP uncomfortable.

In this context, Fanny means butt. He\u2019s talking about her butt.

Don\u2019t comment on other people\u2019s if you\u2019re not trying to send a vibe.", "No it's not. Because most people, do not talk about a girl's ass like that. Normal people, don't just go up to people at the gym and start talking about their asses like that. Not to mention, again it does not matter what his intent was, he ended up sexually harassing her. Intent does not matter when it comes to sexual harassment. If you made someone uncomfortable, you do not get to tell them that what you'd said did not make them uncomfortable. You can try to explain that that was not your intention, but it doesn't erase the end result. When it comes to matters like this, the result is more important than the intention, because someone ended up being hurt. Someone ended up uncomfortable because of your actions in that moment. Which means you need to own up to that, and apologize and try to make it right. Which often times includes not going around them anymore.\nYou do not get to tell somebody that what someone said did not make them uncomfortable. You do not get to make that distinction for anyone but yourself.", "So your dad works at the gym too?", "So he coerced you into STANDING OVER HIS CHEST when you were dressed in a more revealing outfit than usual? He only ever asks you for help, as opposed to the people who actually work there, or people his own age who might be working out, and he's been staring at your chest, making comments about your butt, and generally making you feel uncomfortable. \n\nThis is harassment, he needs to be reported and banned from this gym. \n\nYou are definitely NOT the asshole in this situation. Not at all.", "He\u2019s f\u2019ing disgusting. I hope he gets banned.", "Well that's disgusting.  \n\n\nAlso, who is Jim and why does he want to talk to you? Does he own the gym? Is he a manager? If so, bring up ALLLL of this. If not, it's none of his business and he can butt out.", "Still not appropriate, but less horrifying", "Then yeah, full out harassment and, as an avid gym-goer, I'm sorry you find yourself in this position. It seems that Jim/Ray/dad don't really know how to handle it, either.", "I don't think there is any way to misinterpret the fanny comment. I think you are being lied to about you misinterpreting the situation (and gaslit really). I would do my best to stay away from this guy. In terms of comments to your dad or others -- if you don't want it to be a thing at all, you could try to minimize it by saying \"it was just sort of an uncomfortable moment, but I put it behind me and it doesn't bother me now\" (I would only say the \"it doesn't bother me now\" part if that is really true, but this may be one way to just inform everyone to leave you alone about it while removing any of Jim's social obligations to apologize either).", "Exactly. \n\nUsually in that context people would use the word glutes, especially if they work with trainers or have been lifting and working out for a while. That makes more sense because it focuses specifically on what the workout is targeting. Hamstring, glutes, biceps, etc. Additionally, describing the muscle removes any potential sexual connotation.\n\nUsing fanny is just weird, because it implies that the other person has been looking at your butt or is thinking about it. Even if it wasn't intended to be sexual, the connotations are there. An older man commenting about a younger woman's butt is definitely enough to make someone uncomfortable.", ">but he didn't. He chose to say it's good for 'tightening \\[OP's\\] fanny.' And as OP pointed out, he said \"your\" and not \"the.\" He was specifically referencing OP's body.\n\nOK, let's examine this from a different angle.  OP is a guy.  Old man walks up to him, starts conversation about weights.  Eventually says that leg presses are good for tightening up your butt.  Is the average GUY going to assume that the old man made a sexual comment?\n\nAs I've said before...if anybody bothered to take notice....it's likely \"Dan\" is striking up similar conversations with everybody in the gym...most of them male.  Is he a sexual predator targeting everybody there during their workout?", "Well, it does explain how you and the OP misinterpreted what he said.  Of course leg presses are good for the butt.  Like bench presses are good for arms and chest.   Where you screwed up is in assuming the comment was sexual in nature.  Maybe because \"fanny\" is not a word that is in common use anymore...", ">No it's not. Because most people, do not talk about a girl's ass like that. Normal people, don't just go up to people at the gym and start talking about their asses like that\n\nAgain, he was talking about an exercise...not an ass.", "No he used to go there a lot tho. His coworker Jim and a few others are part of taking care of the gym tho", "He does not own the gym. He and a few other guys help manage the gym but ultimately the county owns it. But about 4 guys do all the work essentially. We come to him with questions or concerns", "My mind went there too.", "I may be misinterpretting the fuck out of it depending on if OP is from the US (comment is about her arse) or the UK (comment is about something else entirely, and FAR more rude)", "You're still arguing in bad faith my dude. OP isn't a guy, and he didn't make those comments to a guy. Your hypotheticals are irrelevant.   \n\n\nIf YOU bothered to take notice of OP's other comments, you would see that this isn't the first time he's been a creep to her.", "It seems that you\u2019re a man, so perhaps you don\u2019t see the problem.  Maybe you\u2019re a little fed up with the #MeToo movement or women\u2019s issues in general; however, as a woman I have no doubt Dan was being a creep.  At the tender age of 14 I  wore a 42DD bra size. You might be interested to know that even at that age I was getting sexually harassed; even having male teachers make comments.  Unfortunately for women, it doesn\u2019t take long to figure out when men are being inappropriate.  Of course, we\u2019re always the AH if we call them out for making \u201cinnocent\u201d or \u201cinnocuous\u201d comments.  This is how women get assaulted, because we\u2019re taught to be polite or ignore unsettling situations because we don\u2019t want to offend the man with whom we\u2019re feeling \u201cskivved out\u201d.", "Uh, no. Op has said that Dan specifically talks to her and asks for her help, even though she doesn\u2019t work there. \n\nHey Dan? Get off the Internet for me. Thanks.", "Dan is welcome to talk to gymbros about their fannies and see where that gets him", "But that's still sexual harassment. That fact does not change just because you changed the gender. That's not the argument you think you're making.\nAnd honestly, if the guy still felt sexually harassed, it would be just as valid. You do not get to make comments on someone else's body when they are not solicited. You do not get to make comments on someone else's body in a gym like that. Especially using specific phrasing. Words do matter. The words you use do have an effect on people whether you want to admit it or not. Words can hurt people. Words can have long-lasting damage on people. That is something you do need to accept, if you want to be a decent person. Which clearly, you are not. Because you are arguing in favor of sexual harassment just because the guy \"didn't mean to\".", "Lol, what? I\u2019m really not sure how I\u2019m misinterpreting anything. He shouldn\u2019t be commenting on her body, either for a sexual reason or not. She didn\u2019t invite his conversation, so it\u2019s irrelevant if he meant it sexually or not. \n\nWhat, do you go around talking about people\u2019s bodies? If you do, you should stop.", "He will specifically mentioned her ass. He could have mentioned that it was good for any other muscle, or even used the medically correct term for her ass, which would be glutes. But no, he specifically used the word Fanny, and talked about her ass.\nIt's disgusting, and it's misogynistic. And so is your defensive him.", "If I come up to you and I start specifically mentioning a part of your body, no matter what the context is, I am in fact speaking about that part of your body. No matter what else we are talking about attached to that subject, I am still talking about that part of your body.\nHe mentioned her ass. Therefore, even though the subject was under the false guys of exercise, he was still talking about her ass. He mentioned that specific part of her body, meaning he was talking about it. That's kind of how that works. You can't argue that fact. If you try to, it shows that You need some serious help. Like some serious deep intense therapy, because no one should be defending this guy this hard. \ud83e\udd26\ud83e\udd26 \nLike seriously, you are showing us way more about you than we ever needed to know by how hard you are going and defending this dude. You seem to be the only one defending him this hard, that should tell you something. That should be a bright flashing light right in your face, that you are wrong.", "It must be the US because a leg press wouldn't tighten up your UK \"fanny.\"", ">If YOU bothered to take notice of OP's other comments, you would see that this isn't the first time he's been a creep to her.\n\nOr, it's not the first time OP made a false assumption about him.  Either is just as likely.", ">It seems that you\u2019re a man, so perhaps you don\u2019t see the problem.

Op has said that Dan specifically talks to her and asks for her help, even though she doesn\u2019t work there.\n\nIs that bad?  I've had lots of people ask me for help at the gym, when I used to go to the gym.  I've never worked for a gym.", "I'm betting Dan does that all the time.  As a former gymbro, I would not be bothered by it. If it occupied my thoughts at all, it would be forgotten before I moved onto the next machine....", ">Lol, what? I\u2019m really not sure how I\u2019m misinterpreting anything. He shouldn\u2019t be commenting on her body, either for a sexual reason or not.\n\nIn context, he was commenting on the workout...or part of the workout.", "Lol, ok man. \n\n  \nI read the post that you deleted about how you identify with Dan because you're about the same age, and it's clear that you identify with this man and don't want to admit he's in the wrong because then you'd have to examine your own habits in how you treat women", "If someone is making you feel creeped out, they don't get to tell you that they're not. If someone is making me feel creeped out by their comments, they do not get to tell me that I have no right to feel creeped out by that. They do not get to tell me how I should or should that feel about it. My feelings in this situation would also matter. OPs feelings matter. They honestly matter a bit more in this situation than dans. Because Dan has made her feel uncomfortable on more than one occasion, and does not seem to understand when to stop. Dan clearly does not understand social cues. So, something needed to be said.\nYou do not get to tell somebody that you did not sexually harass them. You do not get to tell somebody that you did not make them feel uncomfortable or creeped out. You don't get to make that decision. If someone feels harassed or creeped out by you, then it is on you to fix that, and stay away from them. It is on you to take a look at what you were doing that could possibly have made them feel that way. Your intentions are not as important as the end result in matters like this. Your continue argument against that fact, goes to show a lot more about you than it does anyone else. I hope you have the day karma thanks you've earned", "It\u2019s actually called empathy; you know, that thing where you can put yourself into the other person\u2019s shoes?  And your reasoning cuts both ways:  you can\u2019t say that Dan wasn\u2019t being a creep.  Also, the op gives more context in other comments that demonstrate that her reaction wasn\u2019t based on one incident.  My impression is that it seems you\u2019re arguing for argument\u2019s sake.  And while I can\u2019t speak for all women, there is a commonality to experiences of a certain type and if you\u2019ve had one you recognize it.", "I didn't delete anything.   And I clearly stated that I avoid interacting with most young women now.  For this reason.  I would never flirt with, or hit on a young lady in a gym or any other public setting.  But young women often assume I will, just because I'm old and male.  It's an insidious form of discrimination against old people.", "This young woman didn\u2019t assume anything and didn\u2019t even claim she was hit on just that she was uncomfortable with an older man commenting on how working out could give her a tight ass. \n\nWhich is feedback he\u2019s lucky to be receiving as she\u2019s not the only person who would react poorly to a comment like that.", ">But young women often assume I will, just because I'm old and male\n\nYou're only half right. It's not because you're older, it's because you're a man. Women are CONSTANTLY hit on and harassed by men of all ages.", "I use to work at a paramedical clinic in the middle of a lot of retirement housing and dealt with a lot of older gentlemen. There were the sweet ones, the grumpy ones, and the creepy ones. My dad's in his 60s now and honestly pretty awkward but I'm regularly told in private that he's adorable, etc. If you're consistently told that you're creepy, it's not because you're old or ugly, or even because you are male. It's because you're creepy. Women are able to distinguish the difference.", "Maybe it's because of the words that you use. Maybe it's because of the body language you display. Maybe it's because of the looks that you give them. You do have to examine your actions as to figure out why people are creeped out by you. My grandpa is a 70-something-year old man, And when he talks to anyone in public, people don't automatically assume that he's hitting on them, or that he's trying to be creepy. Because his actions, his words, his body language don't display that vibe. They do not give off that kind of feeling. Because he's actually a decent person who treats people with respect. He actually recognizes women as people, who deserve to be treated with respect as well.\nIf you feel like women are automatically assuming you are a creep, then it is on you to figure out why. I would suggest therapy, not social media.", "But nobody ever gave me grief about their false assumptions while I was still young.  So it's not just a man thing.", ">Maybe it's because of the words that you use. Maybe it's because of the body language you display. Maybe it's because of the looks that you give them. You do have to examine your actions as to figure out why people are creeped out by you.\n\nMy behavior has not changed at all in the past 40 years or so.  I had no problem at all in my 20s, 30s and 40s.  Now that I objectively look old, I have to avoid young women as much as possible..  And when I can't help but interact with a young lady, I am POLITE, as I always have been.  I am 100%  certain that is my apparent age and ONLY my apparent age that makes some young ladies feel uncomfortable around me.  Even when I am (ironically) trying to avoid them.  I don't need the hassle.  My girlfriend is 35, smoking hot and very frisky.  I'm not risking that for nothing.  I know I can't replace her easily...", "NTA.  Is Dan the AH?  Maybe.  If he is just clueless (possible) he ought to apologize and then not do it again.  Ray ought to have had a chat with him.  Maybe Jim just wants to let you know that Dan is sorry, learned his lesson, and it won\u2019t happen again.  In this case things should be better.  \nOr Dan is the AH and is lying.   \nAt this point you can choose to talk to Jim or not.  If you do you would be able to find out whether this won\u2019t happen again (and you can go back without worry) or it will happen again (in which case you have to decide what to do).  If you don\u2019t talk to Jim you won\u2019t find out.  \nAsk yourself.  Was you enjoyment you got from the gym (that is before the encounter with dan) greater than the discomfort of talking with Jim about the incident?  If so take the call. If not move on.\n\nEdit: just find your comment on Dan asking you for help.  Really removes the benefit of the doubt for Dan.  \nSorry you had to deal with that.  Hopefully someone set Dan straight.", "Nta. He shouldn't have said anything. But it brought to mind the insurance commercial where after buying a home we turn into our parents. It might be possible he was trying to educate you, not flirt.", "What country are you in. If it\u2019s the UK, I can\u2019t see how it wasn\u2019t sexual. If it was the US, it may not have been sexual, but it wasn\u2019t appropriate. NTA", "Can you clarify roughly where you are? I ask because I am from the UK, and \"fanny\" means vagina. However, I think in the US, it means arse. \n\nTalking about either is not great gym chat, but obviously , one is worse than the other!", "TRUST YOUR GUT!!\nYou are not there to have some old man who could be your grandfather chatting you up about your ass!! \n \nNever disregard your gut instincts!\n\nYou are NOT an asshole!!", "Dan needs to learn not to talk to a stranger about her ass. NTA and you don't owe him a conversation or a phone call.  You have nothing to be embarrassed about.", "INFO:  you mentioned Dan has done other things to male you uncomfortable.  Are those in the comments somewhere?", "Genuine question, what is the connection between the situation and being British?", "You\u2019re joking right? He said it\u2019ll \u201ctighten your fanny,\u201d which may not seem like a big difference from changing the to your, but there is a HUGE difference (especially considering all of Dan\u2019s previous inappropriate behaviour)", "You really wanted to try to tank your karma today, huh?", "OP, always trust your instincts!  And at first chance get a copy of the book, \u201cThe Gift of Fear,\u201d and read it.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019ve been sexually harassed before and reported it to my boss, a man. The harasser, as they always do, denied ill intent and instead placed blame on me. \n\nAs a woman, you\u2019ll be placed in situations where men will try to push your boundaries by disrespecting or dismissing issues you have. Don\u2019t let it slide or have them tell you it\u2019s not a big deal etc. \n\nHe was in the wind and he knows it.", "Why is it much worse for a British person (genuine question, I\u2019m confused at the connection)?", "Fanny means female genitalia in the UK. \n\nWhat Dan said would be identical to \u201ctighten up your vag\u201d", "https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/fanny\n\n> *UK offensive*  \n>a woman's sexual organs", "That's why men get away with this kind of bullshit - women want to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume it was just them misunderstanding.  You don't talk to a 20 something stranger about her \"fanny\" without being completely inappropriate, there's nothing to misunderstand here.", "Before I make my point, I should clarify that I fully agree that what he said was inappropriate even if I give him the benefit of the doubt that he meant it harmlessly, but I\u2019m just not getting the connection here between \u201cyour\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d. Maybe it\u2019s just how I talk and people around me talk, but using \u201cyour\u201d is very common when referencing something even somewhat generically in conversation. Just as the guy you replied to referenced, and even yourself when making the calves example. Just seems weird to get stuck on the common usage of \u201cyour\u201d vs literally everything else that has occurred", "So Dan meant butt? Who calls a Fanny a butt? \n\nI only know the English/Irish definition of Fanny and it\u2019s not butt.", "Fanny is the back in American and the front in British.", "I read the whole story with the British definition in mind.", "That\u2019s what I thought it meant, being the front part, (I\u2019m Canadian) and so I was confused as to how it could be worse, or if there was something happening in the UK relating to increased sexual assaults and attacks in the gym or something. I didn\u2019t realize it meant the butt", "Thanks for the explanation! I assumed it was the front, so I was extremely disgusted by Dans comment. Sorta makes it less inappropriate yet it still it", "The only person allowed to make such comment is an obgyn. The minute someone talks about someone private part it is sexual !!! Your body is none of his concern and you're an adult, they don't need to call your dad - like WTF ?? He just needed to tell the Guy the comment was forbidden, not to let him use lame excuses then call your dad as if you were a Lil girl who didn't understand the situation !!", "Are we sure that the OP is in the US? Because in the UK the fanny isn't the butt, it's the vulva.", "Fanny means butt in the US. It\u2019s never been used in reference to the vagina", "\"Fanny\" is still in common use in Europe and the US. I know multiple people who use it regularly for both definitions. Which can sometimes get complicated. Do you realize that the European meaning is a vagina? That's why they call \"fanny packs\" \"bum bags\" in Britain.  That would be my main reason for thinking he was being sexual and really inappropriate. I'm assuming that's true for multiple people who commented.", "I\u2019m Canadian too, I didn\u2019t realize people in the US use Fanny to refer to butt\u2019s. Dan also meant butt, if that helps.", "Ooh i thought Fanny in a UK sense lol ok not the same. Still none of his business...", "I'm so sorry that happened to you, even at school where you are supposed to be safe.", "I live in Canada, and it\u2019s never been used in reference to a butt where I\u2019m from. It just confusing me right now. \n\nI read the whole story thinking Dan was talking about her vagina.", "I think it only decreases the creep factor by 1%, considering all his other behaviour. Since it\u2019s an older guy giving unsolicited comments on a younger girls body", "I'm Canadian too and I have only ever heard of fanny referring to a butt (at least in North America). Have you people never heard of a fanny pack?", "I\u2019m from the US and never heard Fanny referring to butts", "Weird. Could also be a regional thing too, even though I did say US. But yeah, always meant the booty here", "What part of Canada are you from? It's totally used for butt on the east coast. And central Canada.", "Up to the individual I guess.  I\u2019m a woman of its butt I\u2019d be annoyed and offended, if it was other thing I\u2019d be absolutely disgusted. Even thinking about it makes my skin crawl.", "West coast, but my family is Irish and we lived in an area with lots of English people. \n\nTBH, there\u2019s probably a whole lotta conversations I was baffled by though my life thinking people were talking about vag\u2019s", "I realize I never finished my comment before pressing reply lol, but yeah I agree with you. I still find it inappropriate because of his previous behaviour, and OP doesn\u2019t seem like they have a close relationship with him except for when he forces it at the gym. Like the difference between being hyped up and objectified", "Haha ah yes you're probably right. You must have thought it was very weird that we call \"bum bags\" fanny packs", "Exactly, I used to think it was a bit crass. But like I said, my family is Irish so I was used to crassness."]}
