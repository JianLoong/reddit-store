When it was time for school he over slept and almost missed the bus, I had to wake him up as usual and proceeded to tell him the he needs to stop playing video games so much and start helping out around the house. \n\nTo be fair last year me and his mother went through a divorce that seemed to impact him more than I thought it would. A few months after all of this he started his regular schedule of video games all the time. \n\nToday I went to go get him some snowboarding stuff for ski club that he wanted to try this year but seems to have no interest or appreciation in it or the people helping him get all of his gear. \n\nIn the car on the way to the store I told him all of my thoughts about him being lazy and not being thankful for anything. I told that he needs to start doing chores and needs to stop playing video games all the time and to stop drink soda and eating candy so he can finally start to clear up some of his acne, I was expecting an over the top excuse for anything that I said to him but he just sat still and silent for the rest of the ride and back.\n\n I told him a few extra things on my mind since he was listening, I told him he needs to start to look for a job so he can have a reason to get his license next month and finish learning how to drive.

I have asked him if he wanted to go to therapy or anything but he refused\n\n2. He is perfectly fine in school even achieving high honor roll many times and relatively popular in school from what I\u2019ve heard ( I think since he\u2019s always been good in school we\u2019ve never really done anything special since we didn\u2019t see a reason to because he just kept doing it anyway)\n\n3. He mainly watches whatever anime is and talks to friends for hours everyday from 3 - 11\n\n4. He has mentioned a few times that he wanted to get rid of some of his acne even asking for skin care stuff from his sister and mom\n\n5. I personally don\u2019t think he sees his mom enough he only sees her every other weekend but, I\u2019ve heard he\u2019s going to start going every weekend which is good. But he loves her a lot definitely more than he loves me\n\n6.

It should be earned.", "First and foremost, I\u2019m sorry you, your ex-wife and your son are going through the difficulties associated with a divorce.\n\nThat said, simply giving a bunch of demands to a legal minor/teenager probably will neither convince him to see things your way nor motivate him to be more productive. \n\nIf he\u2019s socially withdrawing, and abstaining from the things he usually enjoys, there\u2019s a good chance he may be suffering from depression. Have you asked him (in a non-confrontational manner) why the drastic changes in his daily activities (e.g. staying up so late, excessive video game use, lack of interest in skiing, etc.)? \n\nBut even in the best of scenarios, asking him if he\u2019d be interested in seeing a therapist to help him sort out all the emotions he undoubtedly must be experiencing as a result of the divorce might still be a good idea. \n\nTeenage years can be confusing enough for adolescents as it is, and when coupled with major life changes like parental divorce, they oftentimes need help learning how to deal with emotions they\u2019ve never experienced before. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he was using games as his escape from the feelings he doesn\u2019t want to think about.\n\n#NTA", "That's normal stuff. You probably let him do too much after the divorce because you worried it would affect him and now he has done too much.\nIt's gonna be good for both of you if he starts having limits. He will soon be grateful for this.", "Look, I'd say NAH because parenting is hard and being a teenager is hard. But I have to go with YTA instead. You thought the silence was your son listening, so you continued to pile it on. Did you stop for one moment to think maybe he was shutting down? Adding more complaints could have only made this worse. \n\nIt's so easy to get frustrated as parents. But we have to remember that the growth our children are going through is exhausting. Not to mention, your son has gone through a lot of life changes this year, coupled with just being a teenager in general. Depression and anxiety could be at play.\n\nHe needs your love, and your guidance. Not your complaints, or frankly, insults (clear your acne, excuse me?) \n\nWe are winging it as parents - there's no handbook. But your hindsight on this one should be clear...you did not handle this one well.", "Yes", "Yup, like he's not *wrong* with his concerns, but just *ow*. The way he laid on to the kid like that.

My guess that if he were married the wife would have said he is just going through a bad phase. This guy resents to actually having to be the parent\u2026", "I am so relieved to see such an important takeaway, so well articulated!\n\nI would be shocked if this kid isn't depressed. To sit there and accept a verbal dress down with no reaction is highly concerning. \n\nSo many people still think of depression as constant crying, but there's much more to it.

You learn how to have good house hygiene when you\u2019re a kid with parents\u2026. Why would you get paid to not be a slob? \n\nWould you expect to pay your kid to brush their teeth?  Probably not\u2026? What\u2019s the difference between brushing teeth and washing your dishes? Both are chores. \nIt\u2019s just the stuff we do as adults to take care of ourselves so we don\u2019t live in filth. \n\nWhy would we want to teach our children to expect payment in order to take care of themselves? \n\n\nIdk, not saying your wrong, just different opinion.", "Strongly agree.

I'm sure that will work out great.", "I'm also not 16, I'm 41 - so I pay myself to clean up after myself (seriously, I give myself an allowance for doing chores).  \n\n\nThe thing about paying your children for chores is it teaches them responsibility and the value of money. They get everything they need, some of what they want - everything else gotta come from their pocket. How do they earn more? do more chores...", "YTA.  Sugar and soda don\u2019t cause acne.

Keep in mind your ex left your ass so maybe learn to keep a wife and a family together first. Make a chore wheel, make consequences, tell him he has to keep his grades up or he has to do all the chores. Also yeah the divorce affected him but you're such a shitty parent that I doubt you fully notice and/or he's just keeping it together because he knows you're useless as a parent.", "Yta. All I read here are your deficiencies as a parent.  Read a book about it or something.", "YTA. Seems like he\u2019s reeling from the split and needs your support not a lecture.

But some of his might be depression. His folks went through a divorce. His parent calls him lazy, and you told him other things on your mind.  Based on your edit your son has a lot going on. He makes good grades, that is not a lazy person.  Now with the ski trip stuff were you fussing at him on your way there, or had you been fussing at him?  Because if the answer is yes, I can understand why he was disinterested.", "At 16 he can set his own alarm- quit waking him up everyday and treating him like at 5 year old. If he\u2019s late- he will have consequences.

He can do this.", "YTA  \n\n\nLike others have said he's dealing with a lot right now and calling him lazy because of it is a recipe for posting \"Why doesn't my son ever want to talk to me\" in a few years.  \n\n\nAnother poster said he might have depression honestly maybe hold out on calling someone for a little while for the depression thing as at that age it can easily go wrong especially if they prescribe stuff. I saw it all the time at that age.  \n\n\n**Firstly apologise!**   \n\n\nYou f\\*\\*\\*ed up and were a bad parent for a bit. You don't have to blame yourself but you do have to acknowledge it if you're ever going to move forward.  \n\n\nTalk to him and ask him what's going on and try to find out what he enjoys doing.  \n\n\nBuying massively expensive stuff because your kid mentioned it is not a good thing its a burden. Your kid is 16 they should have a grasp on what they do and don't like.  \n\n\nThere is a very good chance you've just given him a White Elephant because of an off-hand conversation.  \n\n\nNext, there are things that can help him sleep which don't involve yelling. If you have money to spend on Snowboarding stuff you should be able to afford some smart lights.  \n\n\nPut them in your house and set up a schedule so they dim as time goes on to get him back into a natural sleep schedule.  \n\n\nIf he games on his PC install [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) on there to make it go redder as time goes on and if not to suggest some kind of curfew on video games.  \n\n\nI said \"suggest\" because if you start barking orders then they're going to feel even more like they have no control over their life and you'll make things worse.  \n\n\nThey likely feel like their life is slipping away and they're losing control right now. They use video games as an escape from that.  \n\n\nAs for the acne maybe talk to him about booking a trip to a dermatologist again **stop doing things without asking him first!**  \n\n\nHe's old enough to do a lot of things in a lot of countries. Imagine if someone started just buying things for you you didn't want and demanding you to live your life in a certain way.  \n\n\nGo for a walk with him see some sights see if you can solve these things together.  \n\n\nElse he could very easily try to reach out to other things that aren't video games to supplement what he's lacking *and trust me you don't want that.*", "NTA, but it does sound like you unloaded a lot on him all at once.", "Not to mention having a lot of acne could stem from less energy and motivation to care for oneself which is, yknow\u2026.

Let\u2019s remove what is likely one of the few things that still bring him joy in his life when he\u2019s fucking depressed. Great idea.
