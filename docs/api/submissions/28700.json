We recently \"rescued\" a chameleon from someone who was leaving the country for work for an extended period of time and couldn't bring him. We got his enclosure, lights, misting system, the whole 9 yards for free. He is, uncommonly for a chameleon, very friendly and personable. If his enclosure door is open he will crawl out and come right up to people. He also has the endearing quality of standing up on his hind legs and reaching up with his front claws as if he is a toddler wanting \"uppies\".\n\nSo recently my wife has begun letting him out of his enclosure more and more and often unsupervised. I came upstairs from working in the basement to him standing on one his heat lights. Thankfully he didn't get burned, but he could have. I explained to my wife that he can't be left out unsupervised, we also have a dog and a cat that could try to eat him, he could get stepped on, burn himself, or just otherwise get hurt. She agreed that she would put him away when she was busy. She does MOST of the time, but leaves him out enough that it has become a concern. I have come home from work to find him walking across the floor or just doing random things while she is out in the backyard, in the kitchen, etc. I put him away and remind her that he needs to be put away to protect him.\n\nWell last night I was in my basement working and I hear her crying and saying his name. She didn't put him away, and now she couldn't find him. Thankfully I found him pretty quickly (hiding between his enclosure and the misting pump, happy as a clam). I told her if she left him out unsupervised again, I would be removing him for his own protection. I told her that if she could not be responsible to care for him, somebody else will. She became extremely offended and still won't talk to me.\n\nSo...am I the asshole for telling my wife I would rehome the chameleon for his own protection?", "created_utc": 1697029301, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/175dht9/aita_for_telling_my_wife_i_would_rehome_her/", "score": 308, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If not, then she shouldn\u2019t be ok with continuing to take the chance with him either. Poor little guy!", "NTA. It is an unpleasant situation having to parent your wife like that, but it is the correct one.", "NTA. Your wife is an adult who seems to be otherwise capable of caring for animals. Her love and devotion for an animal does not trump that animal's health and well-being. She lost him, he could have been dead and she had no way of knowing. He deserves better. Should you have to resort to threats with a grown woman? No. Are you doing so because an animals well-being is on the line and that matters more that babying your wife? Yes.\n\nThere is a class of people (not saying your wife is one) who I feel their purported love for animals is actually thinly veiled self interest and they do not actually care for the well-being of animals. They knowingly put animals in dangerous or harmful situations because they personal joy out of the situation (e.g.  encounters between predators like cats with prey like small birds or rodents). They do not want their pets to die or be harmed, but they know there is a large risk and do it anyway because they think it's cute. I am rambling now but in general I am very sad when you see stories of small pets killed in easily preventable accidents. They're just our little buddies who don't know any better, we have to look out for them.", "NTA\n\nYour wife is putting the reptile at risk by doing what she is doing. That isn't being a responsible pet owner. Now if she was watching the reptile while it was out, it would be different. That isn't the case though.", "NTA\n\nIt's not like this is the 1st time", "NTA. Chameleons are one of the more (if not most) fragile reptile pets. Responsible chameleon owners should treat them like they're handling glass, they don't have a lot of the durability that more terrestrial lizard pets do. Not a lot of muscle, thin bones, and VERY delicate protruding eyes. And of all things, they like to live up in branches. Evolution did wonky things with the chameleon.\n\nI understand the infatuation of a new chameleon (I WANT ONE SO BAD, that's why I did so much research!), they have such charisma. But like any good charisma build, very flimsy. Please do re-home chameleon baby if this happens again, for its own sake.", "NTA. shes going to get that lizard hurt or killed because shes lazy", "NTA. you're never an asshole for taking care of an animal and getting them out of a dangerous situation. if she cares about him so much, she should act like it.", "NTA. She can be offended all she wants, because the alternative is basically your wife murdering a chameleon. He deserves better than that.", "I don\u2019t understand the disconnect some pet owners have. I\u2019ve had cats my whole life, they sometimes would get out but thankfully we (mostly) found them. To this day he still will leave the door open or open the garage door when bringing in groceries without telling anyone to lock up the cats (our garage is connected and we leave the door open because one of the litter boxes is in there). We\u2019ve lost cats because of this, he beats himself up about it for sympathy, but continues to do it.\n\nSome people just really shouldn\u2019t have pets.

She's not responsible enough to have this chameleon.

ESH. You aren't her master, you're her husband. Not her daddy. Her husband. Again, not her boss. Her husband. \n\nShe needs to step up and care for this animal the right way. You don't get to punish her like a naughty toddler, dude.", "YTA I know you are trying to protect the chamaeleon but it sounds like it's not the norm and precautions can be taken about heat lamps etc. as much as possible. Let the little guy enjoy his time on earth even if he does meet a sticky end. I'm sure it's much happier than being stuck in a tank or cage. \n\nWe used to let my daughter's minature hamster run about inside the house and would sometimes find her asleep behind the washing machine or in a gap in the skirting boards. She obviously really enjoyed this although my major worry (apart from losing her) was that the rabbit or guinea pig would bite her. Then we moved to an old stone cottage which was NOT mouse-proof anywhere. In other words it was really unsafe as she could easily escape outside or into 1 metre thick stone walls ...\n\nThat poor little hamster. Her quality of life took a nosedive. She used to gnaw and gnaw at her cage until her nose looked bare. We did let her out under close supervision eg on the kitchen table after dinner but it wasn't the same at all. Eventually she died - hamsters don't live long anyway. I felt awful for making her time her so unhappy although I tried my best to get her interesting toys and tunnels and things. She had a beautiful funeral where we all cried buckets.\n\nThe house rabbit used to be loose in the house - she had a cage but didn't like it and slept on the sofa. A jack russell got in the house without me noticing because I was chatting to the owner outside and poor bunny died of fright. A very sad end but BUNNY HAD A HAPPY LIFE. She was given to us because she spent all her time in a cage before and she did loads of binkies the first day she was with us and was allowed to run around the living room.\n\nHappy days are better than longer days imo. But maybe that's me.", "Threatening to re-home him makes it sound like you don't love the chameleon either though. \n\nI don't think you're an AH but I don't see why jumping to removing a pet you both care for is okay either.", "NTA. She is not keeping him safe. She can keep him safe and chooses not to. It would he a huge shame to have to rehome him, but if she refuses to care for him by keeping him safe, then you have no other choice. You too are responsible for his welfare.", "NTA. Your wife is acting like a child. She should step up or get rid of it if she really gives a crap about the chameleon.", "NTA its well knowm you dont let reptiles put unsupervised. I have reptiles too and its reckless and stupid to let something especially a chameleon out unsupervised. This time he was fine but what happens next time? A cat gets into the room and finds a new toy? A dog decides to attack? Its a risk with no reward.", "NTA. You are way more patient than I would be with this. The second time I woulda put my foot down. I would hate for this animal to get hurt or die due to her incompetence.", "NTA. show her how everyone thinks she's an awful pet owner.", "NTA.  Let her pout.  She's putting the little fella in danger again and again.  While she's pouting and not talking to you, tell her that you're serious and will rehome it.  You're not asking her to do something unrealistic.  She's forgetting he's a little reptile, not a cat.", "Chameleons are very particular about care requirements. Leaving the little lizard to free roam just isn't safe for the pet, and is wildly irresponsible, especially when there are other free roaming pets in the house.", "I think this was really well put and I agree completely.", "[deleted]", "Yes sooo fragile even to themselves, my grandpa had a chameleon for a little over a year and slowly passed away after the stress of laying eggs was too much for her </3", "Out of curiosity, since I don't have reptiles but am very interested in them, can you let the more durable terrestrial lizards free roam safely?", "Good thought, but likely wouldn't be a safe idea. Unless the enclosure itself is wildly improper and lacks all enrichment, reptiles and amphibians actually don't NEED to be taken out regularly, and chameleons are SUPER fragile.  The best option here is for it to be better supervised or rehomed, unfortunately. Sorry if I'm coming across badly, BTW. I'm not trying to be condescending at all, I'm just a reptile nerd.", "She is very responsible for the others (1 bearded dragon and 2 Peter's Banded Skinks). She is just infatuated with this chameleon, so she let's him out all the time.", "Nope.", "If she can't or won't take care of it properly what else is he supposed to do, let it die so as to not make a \"weird marriage dynamic\"?", "He's not punishing her. He's just doing what's best for the chameleon.", "Well i mean if he isn't getting cared for (atleast half the time) then it's best for the chameleon to get a new home.", "Yeah, in their natural habitat, which a home is not. Reptile pets should never be left unsupervised in an unsecured area that isn't completely reptileproofed and climate controlled for their needs. If you adequately set up an entire room that way and make sure they can't escape it, sure, let them freely roam in that room, otherwise...", "I did it with my bearded dragon Darth Vader before we got 3 cats and a pitbull mix who are all free roaming.\n\nHe was fine, and the only time I lost him is when he was 6 months old, and he somehow flattened himself out to walk under my bedroom door to greet my parents when they woke up.\n\nNow i keep a towel up against the door to prevent him from doing that.", "Roam freely but always under surveillance. I could let my turtle roam free in my bedroom, but I always needed to block access to under my bed, or behind my dresser where she could get trapped. \n\nThe bigger the lizard, the less hazard of free roaming, imo. I've seen people with free roam iguanas and tegu.", "This is such a weird thing to do for 'infatuation'. Chams are INCREDIBLY delicate. I would be treating it like glass if I was infatuated with it, not letting it free roam. The animal doesn't even benefit from being 'let out!' It needs to remain in its enclosure where it has the proper heating, lighting and humidity. Getting it out is just placing it out in the cold for it to suffer for a bit or at least be uncomfortable. As a reptile keeper I don't get this at all.", "NTA.  You have to do what's best for that animal.  Like you stated, a number of bad things could happen.  How's she going to feel if he gets burned, or the dog eats him?", "Agreed but I don't understand why (assuming they live together, which seems like it from the comment) OP isn't caring for their pet themself? \n\nBoth of them are potentially AHs if they aren't caring for the chameleon.", "To add to this, in their \"natural\" habitat they could also be eatten at any moment. Using natural habitat as an argument for anything is pointless at best.", "Because as most people inferred from the post her leaving the chameleon around where it could be harmed is how she\u2019s not taking care of it. His wife has been letting the chameleon out for extended periods of time without letting OP know. What is OP supposed to do to help take care of it in that way? Watch his wife 24/7 to make sure she\u2019s not letting the chameleon out to wander?", "Yeah but that's part of the environment, him being eaten by a dog or cat is unnatural and avoidable."]}
