We recently \"rescued\" a chameleon from someone who was leaving the country for work for an extended period of time and couldn't bring him. We got his enclosure, lights, misting system, the whole 9 yards for free. He is, uncommonly for a chameleon, very friendly and personable. If his enclosure door is open he will crawl out and come right up to people. He also has the endearing quality of standing up on his hind legs and reaching up with his front claws as if he is a toddler wanting \"uppies\".\n\nSo recently my wife has begun letting him out of his enclosure more and more and often unsupervised. I came upstairs from working in the basement to him standing on one his heat lights. Thankfully he didn't get burned, but he could have. I explained to my wife that he can't be left out unsupervised, we also have a dog and a cat that could try to eat him, he could get stepped on, burn himself, or just otherwise get hurt. She agreed that she would put him away when she was busy. She does MOST of the time, but leaves him out enough that it has become a concern. I have come home from work to find him walking across the floor or just doing random things while she is out in the backyard, in the kitchen, etc. I put him away and remind her that he needs to be put away to protect him.\n\nWell last night I was in my basement working and I hear her crying and saying his name. She didn't put him away, and now she couldn't find him. Thankfully I found him pretty quickly (hiding between his enclosure and the misting pump, happy as a clam). I told her if she left him out unsupervised again, I would be removing him for his own protection. I told her that if she could not be responsible to care for him, somebody else will. She became extremely offended and still won't talk to me.\n\nSo...am I the asshole for telling my wife I would rehome the chameleon for his own protection?", "created_utc": 1697029301, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/175dht9/aita_for_telling_my_wife_i_would_rehome_her/", "score": 1570, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She obviously really enjoyed this although my major worry (apart from losing her) was that the rabbit or guinea pig would bite her. Then we moved to an old stone cottage which was NOT mouse-proof anywhere. In other words it was really unsafe as she could easily escape outside or into 1 metre thick stone walls ...\n\nThat poor little hamster. Her quality of life took a nosedive. She used to gnaw and gnaw at her cage until her nose looked bare. We did let her out under close supervision eg on the kitchen table after dinner but it wasn't the same at all.

She had a beautiful funeral where we all cried buckets.\n\nThe house rabbit used to be loose in the house - she had a cage but didn't like it and slept on the sofa. A jack russell got in the house without me noticing because I was chatting to the owner outside and poor bunny died of fright. A very sad end but BUNNY HAD A HAPPY LIFE.

She can let him out multiple times but always set that timer so she never just forgets about him.  Obviously if she is leaving the house or even the room she should just put him back.  Also, tell her you love her and know she is a good person who cares about animals and you don't want her to put herself in a position where an animal is hurt or killed because of her actions because you know she would feel terrible and never forgive herself.

A bearded dragon or hell even a Leopard Gecko are great starting reptiles. They can be fun and personable and have great personalities, and their enclosures aren't unmanageable.\n\nLarge reptiles are a different story. Their enclosures are pretty much an entire room of your house. Tegus are typically well-tempered, and monitors can be as well. But they are also big enough to seriously injure you (like take pieces of you). The price of these lizards can be attractive ($<40 at a lot of reptile shows for a baby nile or savannah monitor) but what they don't tell you is that small baby will grow up into a 4-6' long velociraptor that exists only to eat, and is very well equipped for that goal.

There was no appeasing it, either you were okay or you had to be demolished.", "I\u2019d probably let my kid\u2019s gecko free roam, but only with direct supervision as (1) her room is messy and too many places for him to hide and (2) fresh gecko shit is rank and I wouldn\u2019t want to have to hunt to find it.", "But she isn\u2019t infatuated. That would be like handling it all the time. \n\nIs she instagramming her \u2018free roam\u2019 chameleon or something because she is neglecting it.", "Ah, OK. Thanks for the information.", "I actually set up his enclosure to be 100% bioactive. Live golden pothos plants, isopods, the whole works. He DOES genuinely seem to want time out of his enclosure though (I know it's strange, ESPECIALLY for a chameleon). I limit his \"uppies\" time to about 10-15 minutes though.", "Thank you for explaining. That makes a lot of sense and I'm sorry you might have to make that hard decision \ud83e\udec2", "I don\u2019t know if this is a middle ground you\u2019d be interested in, but maybe a lock would be a good idea if you do end up finding her doing this again and it takes a while to rehome. Or if you want to use that as a middle ground.", "Maybe some pvc pipe and mesh netting can make him a playpen yo safely hang out in. (With some twine or leather string for him to hang from\u2026. 3 artificial vines and a edible plant should keep him happy. )", "Our girls love them.  Never had a problem with them.", "The first year survival of Nile monitors is fucking abysmal.", ">what they don't tell you is that small baby will grow up into a 4-6' long velociraptor that exists only to eat, and is very well equipped for that goal. If it decides you are on the menu, there isn't much the average person can do about it.\n\nSo much this.  I have giant pythons and one venomous snake, and they are a lot easier to deal with than a tegu or monitor.", "Darth Vader tax pls.", "5 foot?! Thanks for the new nightmare material.", "In defense of the \"letting him out\" part, he DOES seem to genuinely enjoy being out of his enclosure, even if I personally limit it to 10-15 minutes max.", "WOW. That sounds incredible, dude. Sorry if it sounded like I was dissing your setup or suggesting keeping him in all the time, as it does seem like he wants out.  My main point was just in agreement that free- roaming unsupervised is both unnecessary and unsafe. I'd love to try bioactive if I ever get any reptiles besides my sliders! I've got plans in the works for a huge bioactive leachie gecko habitat, though it'll be a LONG time before I'm able to afford that, lol.", "Dude, I say this as someone with a lot of animals and a pet supply store- you are so solid on your care for animals. I know there are people who are probably giving you shit for being \u201ccontrolling\u201d or \u201cmaking unilateral decisions\u201d, but you\u2019re advocating for an animal that can\u2019t speak and honestly would make really dumb choices for itself, as evidenced by sitting on his heat lamp. I cannot fathom why she wouldn\u2019t put him back when she isn\u2019t actively engaging with him. It\u2019s irresponsible.", "They sell Guinea pig playpens (that are zippered mesh tents) that with some stuff inside would make a safe place for your chameleon to hang out in the living room with you.  A pothos plant in there would give him something to snack on /play on.", "Same for Savannahs.", "What?", "Look I'm a former chameleon owner.  I raised 3 different breeds of chameleons for about 12 years.  I don't have any currently because man... they're just a lot of work.\n\nI love chameleons... but you guys are projecting a whole lot of personality onto this chameleon that just isn't there.  It's great that your chameleon tolerates and enjoys being handled.  That part is great, and you're right, most chameleons are skittish at best or aggressive at worst.\n\nThe \"enjoying\" being out of its cage or \"wanting uppies\" is just silly though.  Chameleons don't have emotions like that.  He does the \"uppies\" because he's on the ground, and chameleons are arboreal creatures, and naturally want to climb things.  He stands on his hind legs because he thinks he sees something he can climb.\n\nHe seems to \"enjoy\" being out of his cage for two reasons.  Either his cage is too small or doesn't have enough hiding places, or isn't quite the right temperature or humidity... or he is looking for food or just being territorial by expanding his \"territory\".  He might even be hunting for a female.\n\nAll that said, if your chameleon is healthy there's nothing wrong with letting it free roam, in the proper environment.  I would strongly encourage you to get some large indoor plants or trees, like a ficus or a hibiscus, and let him climb on that instead of across the floor though.  DEFINITELY not unsupervised and definitely not in the presence of CATS though.", "I think you might be anthropomorphizing it. It doesn't know the difference. Changing up the enclosure and adding new climbing opportunities can add the exact same enrichment without putting it outside its temperature gradient.", "Oh and they sell bearded dragon harnesses/leashes on Amazon", "They want a picture of your pet bearded dragon Darth Vader. And i do too!", "Lol, they would like you to share a pic of your pet \ud83d\ude43", "This is a silly take. Some reptiles and other pets enjoy coming out of their cage. Whatever the reverse of anthropomorphism is, I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing.", "It's not anthropomorphizing to say that animals enjoy things, or that they enjoy enriching environments and activities. They do know the difference, otherwise the environment/activity wouldn't be enriching", "How do I post a pic?", "Yeah, the word \"anthropomorphizing\" gets thrown around waaaaay too easily. People use it any time someone suggests that an animal feels anything, or is capable of any level of thought. (Despite the fact that the only reason we have emotions is because we're animals, and we're unique because of how advanced our thought is, not because of being capable of it in the first place.)", "Er, as someone that's been in the animal care industry for 8 years, I disagree, but to each their own. They don't have the brain chemistry to 'enjoy' things. They can be stimulated by new enrichment and a new environment, or they can be stressed by it. But they don't have the brain chemistry for 'enjoy'. And you can offer safer enrichment by changing up their enclosure.\n\nEdit: REPTILES. not all animals. Ya'll, it is a huge disservice to reptiles to treat them as if they are mammals capable of these things. They are not, and we can still appreciate them but we must understand their needs. It is HARMFUL to treat them as if they are mammals.", "you're on the internet. Any way you want, then link it.", "It's exhausting when people reject science for 'but I want to think my pet feels human things :(((' have respect for the animal as it is, don't assign it human emotions it does not have. You can still love your pets and understand that they don't feel the same things we do.", "So i just made an imgur account. Not sure i did it currently but im posting the link.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/KiLhIII", "Animals play, animals have fun. I\u2019m not saying they know what\u2019s it like to be in love or get cheated on or to have anxiety about paying rent. Animals frequently request experiences that they enjoy (like coming out of a cage, playing in the shower, going for walks, etc).", "oh wow, that's a fat boi! Lovely color.", "Some animals do, yes. Corvids are especially known to exhibit play behaviors. I am talking specifically about reptiles, though. Chameleons don't play or have fun, they literally do not have the brain chemistry to do so. They thermoregulate, they explore, they can experience new things and I would even say be curious or interested (in if something is food). But they do not have the receptors in their brains to be happy or excited. \n\nI'm not saying ALL ANIMALS. I am saying REPTILES. People frequently do these animals a HUGE disservice by treating then like mammals that can play or love to be pet or like to come out, like this example. It is HARMFUL to treat them as such.", "Woah. My daughter and I love watching the chameleon at the local pet store, but we never considered it bc they are a high need pet, and I would feel terrible if accidently killed it or injured it. And even if let it out, to do so without supervision ?!?  Wife is in the wrong here.", "NTA you\u2019re thinking of the wee fellows safety!", "NTA", "NTA. That chameleon will thank you.", "Im going to get downvoted for this, but YTA.\n\nYou're not wrong about anything you said, and it seems like you were patient (but also let things escalate) and then you gave your wife an ultimatum like she's a child. Again, you're not WRONG but your timing and delivery was asshole ish.", "Ask her why she likes to let him roam.\n\nAnd work off that. Letting the chameleon out can certainly be bad judgement, but it may not be ill-intended. \n\nTalk to your wife.", "Aren't chameleons like notoriously difficult compared to most other lizards?", "Ya know, I will accept this one. You are absolutely right.", "I mean act like a child be treated like a child. How many times does one have to remind someone adult to adult, until it is dead?", "Act like a child get treated like a child. She was initially treated as an adult but showed she is too incompetent to be entitled to that. Also if she is endangering it then op is right it needs better caretakers.", "I was bringing my cat home from the vet once and a car pulled out right in front of me. Had to slam on the brakes hard. If her pet carrier hadn\u2019t been belted in, it would have hit the windshield.", "That isnt just unsafe for the dog, its unsafe for every human in the car too. Aside from being a huge distraction for the driver.\n\nI only have cats now, but no animal I own will ever be loose in a vehicle. I buckle their kennels in, to be sure.", "As someone who has had a pet related sidegig for 15+ years...this is incredibly true.\n\nLike, depressingly true.", "Technically yes. Practically...sooo messy and a huge PITA. I pet sit and have looked after a few large free roam lizards.\n\nFor one, many reptiles require access to a high heat basking area to digest properly. A small lizard loose in a room is unlikely to spend enough time under the light, or may have too far to travel from food source, hiding source, and basking spot. \n\nLizards arent technically domesticated, and yes they obviously do this \"in the wild\". However, your average pet lizard - any species - is *drastically* less physically fit or \"athletic\" than a wild cousin which has literally been running, climbing, hiding, and hunting for their whole life rather than the scaley equivalent of couch sitting while being fed grapes.\n\nSo, small lizards are out. Big lizards are, firstly, BIG. That means large quantities of food, and also big gross poops. And most of them cant be housetrained reliably. They may also be aggressive during certain points of the year.\n\nAs someone who was once chased by a free-roaming and very large male iguana when I was just trying to ckean up his poop...0/10. Would not recommend.\n\nTBH, anything that gets large enough to free-roam safely...I don't personally feel should be \"pets\", ethically. We just cant meet their needs in a home setting, unless you can build * and maintain* a full on house-sized greenhouse.", "Treat someone like a child, get divorced like a child. She's the breadwinner. Obviously, she's not a child considering she's taking care of her partner. That's what grown-ups do.", "There are, but they arent actually held to any safety standards. So effectiveness is going to be iffy.\n\nIMO, a crash rated kennel thats strapped or locked in is safest. But again, there are no safety standards for kennels. I just feel theres fewer failure points to a crash tested kennel.", "Idk what you read but from the comments I saw op works 2 jobs so she taking care of shit specially not the chameleon. Scrolled through and found exact text: \u201cI do love him. But he is in danger if she continues leaving him out. I work 2 jobs and can't be around 24/7 to make sure she is being responsible with him.\n\nSo I would rather re-home him, losing a pet I do love and care for, but ensuring he is going to a good home and will be well and responsibly kept.\u201d \nSo according to your logic she is just 100% irresponsible child", "Look, most of it is tail.\n\nIs that comforting when its chasing you? Not at all. Lol", "I actually made my beardie a harness out of paracord."]}
