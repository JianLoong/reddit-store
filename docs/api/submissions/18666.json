I am firmly against this whole practice. \n\nAlso you have your own disability, so there's that too.", "NTA. To me your medical and ability status is completely irrelevant. You paid for that specific seat so they absolutely should be asking rather than telling. \n\nWheelchairs don't make people incapable of preplanning. That individual could have also booked a specific seat if they'd planned well enough in advance, I'm sure.", "NTA\n\nYou paid for the seat, you are in no way obligated to give it up, ESPECIALLY if you weren't asked.", "NTA. You're a paying customer who planned ahead for your own needs.", "NTA - Many factors here are not fully clear, but it's really the airlines problem and not yours to accommodate other passengers.\n\nAs for seat... If you paid for A seat in economy, then you can be moved even if you picked a specific one because that's treated more like a preference. Nothing wrong with asking for a  comparable seat! \"Hey, no problem as long as I can have the same (example) aisle seat I chose as I need that.\" You picked it, planned your trip and that's part of the situation you planned for (carryons and access to such). If you have a condition, then that's 100% a factor as well. If you paid for an upgraded seat, such as with more legroom, then you generally get to keep that seat and can insist on a comparable seat. There are regulations around the money an airline has to pay you for not providing a seat you paid for, but when it boils down to it a stewardess can relocate you without your consent. She'll just have to answer to the airline later about it, especially if she forced you into a lower value seat because now the airline is in breach of contract for what you were sold.\n\nI had similar happen where I had paid for an upgraded seat with more leg room. I get some anxiety when in a middle or window seat, so I always go out of my way to ensure I have an aisle seat. Along comes stewardess asking to relocate me to a middle seat so a family could sit together. I said \"no thank you. I paid extra for this seat to be in an aisle seat for my condition. If you have another aisle seat, then I would consider it\" except none were available. They tried to bully me into it and ask about my condition with a snarky tone. I held my ground, told them I am not discussing my medical conditions with them, and asked if they were refusing to provide the exact seat I paid the airline extra for? They gave up and found another solution. I've relocated several times to help other passengers, but I'm not giving up my paid value because another passenger or the airline failed to plan appropriately.", "Airlines oversell, double-book, make seats smaller, charge for everything, and constantly delay flights and lose luggage. Their entire focus is profits at the expense of any customer comfort (and sometimes safety). They accept government subsidies, bailouts etc and breach the conditions without penalty. This is one hundred percent on them and not at all on you. NTA", "NTA. The airline doesn't just get to reassign your seat without your permission. And how tf do they know you didn't need that seat to deal with a disability of your own? That's right, they didn't.", "Being a flight attendant right now has to be one of the toughest jobs, but they STILL need to give good customer service. Airlines treat people like garbage! NTA for sticking up for yourself. You have medical needs, too.", " NTA I would be shocked if your disability act puts the responsibility on clients rather than merchants.

All of this is also impacted by his own health conditions, which is why he paid extra to get the seat. Kindness is a two way street.
