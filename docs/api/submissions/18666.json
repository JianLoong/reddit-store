Nothing wrong with asking for a  comparable seat! \"Hey, no problem as long as I can have the same (example) aisle seat I chose as I need that.\" You picked it, planned your trip and that's part of the situation you planned for (carryons and access to such).

There are regulations around the money an airline has to pay you for not providing a seat you paid for, but when it boils down to it a stewardess can relocate you without your consent. She'll just have to answer to the airline later about it, especially if she forced you into a lower value seat because now the airline is in breach of contract for what you were sold.\n\nI had similar happen where I had paid for an upgraded seat with more leg room.

If you have another aisle seat, then I would consider it\" except none were available. They tried to bully me into it and ask about my condition with a snarky tone. I held my ground, told them I am not discussing my medical conditions with them, and asked if they were refusing to provide the exact seat I paid the airline extra for?

This way you don't have to worry about your own chair being damaged.\n\nAirlines may differ so check but my general advice on plane chair storage if you take your own;\n\nCheck that all bolts etc are tight before going to the airport. Pack a small toolkit and know how to fix minor repairs. Cloth wrap any bits of your chair you don't want scratched. \n\nIf you are checking it with luggage, remove anything detachable by hand like footrests and sideguards, put them in a sturdy bag and have them checked with your chair, including with their own label.

My disabilities were incurred during my 20 year career(100% disabled). Flying is not a right and choosing an upgraded seat that I paid for is also not a right.

I am only 45 years old and my body has been wrecked to the point I am limited in what I can do. I paid for the upgraded seat to accommodate MY disabilities, not sure if you ever have tried to walk with severely swollen knees, lower legs, and ankles...if not let me assure you that it is extremely painful.

In this particular instance we have 2 people with disabilities, I choose to pre-plan to accommodate mine.", "Thank you for that and thank you for your support of veterans.", "Someone said I did it out of spite. That wasn't the case. I had been up since 3am to make it to the airport to make my flight, was treated rudely, and have disabilities that make it very difficult and painful to walk.

IME, folks are really helpful but they are also pretty uncomfortable especially if it involves touching you and you have to be able to explain exactly what you need and how will be easiest to get that done.  \n\nBe really clear about whether you will need the aisle chair to get to your seat and how much help from airline staff you will need getting from your chair to the aisle chair and the aisle chair to your seat and back.  \u201cI don\u2019t need help transferring to and from the seats but I cannot walk down the jetway or the aisle of the plane.

If you use a slideboard, keep that with you.  Be prepared for some air loss in your tires.  (Bring a bike pump and maybe some slime and a patch kit).  \n\nDon\u2019t leave the jetway until you have all the pieces of your chair or an airline representative escorting you to wherever the chair allegedly is.  \n\nMy best flying experiences have all been with southwest - the cabin and airport staff are very helpful, chill and proactive - also they\u2019ve never lost any of my chair stuff or given me anyone else\u2019s.", "Yes, they should have offered compensation. My other guess would be they double booked the seat and either OP or the chair user had to move. I have always had to book a specific seat when arranging a wheelchair flight.\n\nI was aiming to correct the assumption the wheelchair user was at fault through lack of preparation. It takes extra effort to fly with a chair and most users over prepare and leave plenty of time on each end. \n\nPermanent chair users are normally first on/last off but if they need to make a connection, the pilot will ask everyone to sit so the chair user can get off first. Some airports you'll be taken through service corridors which are quieter and save a lot of time. It won't fix a catastrophic delay but if the chair user can go at speed it can be much faster than running! When this happened to us my nephew zoomed off in front in his chair while I had to get a ride on the airport buggy to keep up. \n\nWe'd left several hours in between flights and were stil nearly tanked by some fault.

When you check in, which you can do up to 24 hours before your flight departs, you are assigned one of 120 boarding positions labeled in groups A-C, positions 1-40.  In the boarding area are posts that are labeled with these numbers such that you form two lines. During the boarding process, each of the groups is invited to line up numerically along the posts, and are then processed into the airplane where they will select a seat. People who are labeled \"disabled,\" which includes overweight people, are processed first, then group A, then military members traveling on orders and families with small children, followed by groups B and C.\n\nSo no one would have paid to have the seats I select. The best you can do is pay to have Southwest automatically check you in, which does tend to lower your place in the boarding process. \n\nThe only annoying thing about it is that because check in is determined by your flight time, people who are continuing a flight are prioritized for the second leg, because they check in 24 hours before their first leg.", "Yeah, I was offering an alternate explanation where the wheelchair user wasn't at fault. I had an experience traveling with my >80 yr old grandmother where they didn't hold the connecting flight for us or provide any assistance. I basically ran ahead and explained the situation. So I could absolutely see an airline fucking up with a wheelchair user, despite the wheelchair user's best attempts to get smoothly to their destination.", "Because the person in 1A was likely an airline employee and they like to lookout for their own.", "Most airlines in the USA will book every seat and then deliberately book a few seats twice.  This means that even though people pay to pick their specific seat, there is not guarantee that they will get what they paid for.\n\nIt's also ridiculous that the customer can pay extra for that seat with a couple clicks, but getting reimbursed for that seat can require an hour or longer of sitting on the phone with customer service if you're bumped from that seat.  The airline hopes the customer will give up so they can keep the money, and the customer is not paid for the wasted time.", "Back when I could still fit in one seat, I flew a flight that was heavily overbooked because of weather related cancellations, and had a window seat. Late in the boarding process, a child of about 4 or 5yo was placed in the middle seat between me and the gentleman who had the aisle seat. It was a long and late flight, and after a while she fell asleep with her head on my leg, cuddle up but with her feet against the man's leg. (I've spent a lot of time working with young kids in camps and such, so I didn't really mind.) At some point I looked over and said to the man, something about how his daughter wasn't bothering me, in case it was a concern. That's what I found out that he thought she was my daughter. Instead she had been split up from her parents.", "He's talking about boarding, not check in.", "Yes, was asking about that company you use. Thanks! That's interesting way, never saw no preassigned seats thing.", "Never had this experience with regular companies in Europe but a lot with low-cost. Maybe you're right, it's regional thing", "Can confirm that they look out for their own. My cousin works for Alaska Airlines", "Exactly", "I don't think you can select and pay for seats on Southwest.
