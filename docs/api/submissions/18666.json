If you paid for A seat in economy, then you can be moved even if you picked a specific one because that's treated more like a preference. Nothing wrong with asking for a  comparable seat! \"Hey, no problem as long as I can have the same (example) aisle seat I chose as I need that.\" You picked it, planned your trip and that's part of the situation you planned for (carryons and access to such). If you have a condition, then that's 100% a factor as well. If you paid for an upgraded seat, such as with more legroom, then you generally get to keep that seat and can insist on a comparable seat. There are regulations around the money an airline has to pay you for not providing a seat you paid for, but when it boils down to it a stewardess can relocate you without your consent. She'll just have to answer to the airline later about it, especially if she forced you into a lower value seat because now the airline is in breach of contract for what you were sold.\n\nI had similar happen where I had paid for an upgraded seat with more leg room. I get some anxiety when in a middle or window seat, so I always go out of my way to ensure I have an aisle seat. Along comes stewardess asking to relocate me to a middle seat so a family could sit together. I said \"no thank you. I paid extra for this seat to be in an aisle seat for my condition. If you have another aisle seat, then I would consider it\" except none were available. They tried to bully me into it and ask about my condition with a snarky tone. I held my ground, told them I am not discussing my medical conditions with them, and asked if they were refusing to provide the exact seat I paid the airline extra for?

Both of those things happen a lot.  \n\nTo make it all super fun, some airlines automatically void your (paid) seat selection if you\u2019re in a chair to \u201csimplify\u201d the process of onboarding and offloading.  \n\nMost wheelchair users are pretty conscientious about making sure we are fully compliant because flying is such a logistical nightmare and most airlines are pretty awful to deal with.

If they have to do this then the passengers should be compensated for any inconveniences, and a disabled passenger who paid extra to book specific seats certainly shouldn't be the one bearing the brunt of this.", "I am overweight to the point that I require two airplane seats.
