I've already talked to my husband about everything and he was on board with everything until I reminded him what the plan was gonna be this morning. \n\nHe didn't like the idea of my mom watching our kids (2f & 1m) all four days because he didn't think my mom could handle it, but she's always the one who watches the kids when my husband and I were working. We can't afford daycare or a babysitter so that's out of the question. So I suggested that I can do night classes from 5:30-9pm, since he usually gets off work around 4 or 6. He asked me who was gonna pick the kids up and watch them. I told him that he was gonna do it, since I didn't get out of class till 9 and he got really angry saying that I expected him to pick up our kids from my mom's (30 minutes from our house) after he had a long day at work. I told him it was just a suggestion just to see which one he liked better and he blew up and said that I was stupid for even suggesting something so retarded and that I can go pick up the kids after my class. I started getting upset and yelled that he shouldn't have said that, that it was really mean of him for saying that and he told me that I was being sensitive and to go cry about it. I then asked him what he wanted to do since everything I suggested was bad he then said, he didn't know and told me to figure it out, but when I kept trying to tell him what else we could do he just told me to shut the F up and left. My take on why he got really upset is because usually when he gets off work, dinner and the kids are all done. The kids are showered and I always put them to bed, he goes to the gym after work and sometimes doesn't get back home till 9 but if he gets off from work early he gets home around 6 so once he's home everything is done for him and he just showers, eats and plays his video games. I get it he's tired and he's making all the money so he deserves his time, but I told him that it was only gonna be 4 days out of the week and he said he didn't think it was fair for him to work so hard and not get his own time during those 4 days.

He is programming them with every action he takes.  Your daughter, when older, may subconsciously look for a man who is abusive, since that is the behavior she has seen him model.\n\nI would suggest marriage counseling but from the way you describe your husband, seems unlikely he will participate.
