I (38M) am in a relationship with my girlfriend (35F) and we've been seriously discussing marriage recently. I was married once before, which ended 7 years ago when my ex-wife decided she wanted a different life.\n\nA relevant detail is that I had made my own wedding ring for my previous marriage. It's a beautiful piece and I'm incredibly proud of it. in the past I was proud because it was a symbol of a significant period of my life, now I'm proud of it because it's one of the few nice things I've built with my own hands that I got to keep for myself. When my marriage ended, I stopped wearing the ring, but I still valued it for what it represented to me.\n\nSo, the issue arose when I suggested to my current girlfriend that I would like to use the same ring for our marriage. She was really upset. She's always known about the ring and acknowledged its aesthetic value, but to her, the ring is a symbol of my past relationship with my ex. She's hurt that I would even consider reusing the ring for our potential marriage.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that she still owns her engagement ring from a previous relationship and has been saying she'll sell it since I've known her, but it hasn't happened yet. However, I'm not comparing our situations directly. I do understand her feelings about my ring. The thing is, her reaction was so strong that it took me by surprise.\n\nSo, reddit, AITA for wanting to reuse my handmade wedding ring from my previous marriage?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) No, I'm not still hung up on my ex.
