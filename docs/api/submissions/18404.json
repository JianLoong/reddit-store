I (38M) am in a relationship with my girlfriend (35F) and we've been seriously discussing marriage recently. I was married once before, which ended 7 years ago when my ex-wife decided she wanted a different life.\n\nA relevant detail is that I had made my own wedding ring for my previous marriage. It's a beautiful piece and I'm incredibly proud of it. in the past I was proud because it was a symbol of a significant period of my life, now I'm proud of it because it's one of the few nice things I've built with my own hands that I got to keep for myself. When my marriage ended, I stopped wearing the ring, but I still valued it for what it represented to me.\n\nSo, the issue arose when I suggested to my current girlfriend that I would like to use the same ring for our marriage. She was really upset. She's always known about the ring and acknowledged its aesthetic value, but to her, the ring is a symbol of my past relationship with my ex. She's hurt that I would even consider reusing the ring for our potential marriage.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that she still owns her engagement ring from a previous relationship and has been saying she'll sell it since I've known her, but it hasn't happened yet. However, I'm not comparing our situations directly. I do understand her feelings about my ring. The thing is, her reaction was so strong that it took me by surprise.\n\nSo, reddit, AITA for wanting to reuse my handmade wedding ring from my previous marriage?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) No, I'm not still hung up on my ex. This really is about a thing I made that I personally like.\n\n2)  I can't make a new ring, I don't have the time or the space that I had previously.\n\n3) Even if I could make another, it was not a trivial thing to make.\n\n4) I won't \"just\" be making 2 rings either. it is not feasible\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1685307406, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13uaxt7/aita_for_wanting_to_reuse_my_handmade_wedding_ring/", "score": 278, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And be thankful that you are marrying a woman that can see past your occasional inability to understand a situation.", "YTA - keep the ring, wear it in a different finger but do not by all that\u2019s holy use it as your \u2018new\u2019  wedding ring - that\u2019s unbelievably tacky and an insult to your new wife.", "YTA - That's your ring from another marriage", "YTA, come on, don\u2019t be such a creep.", "YTA. Sorry, dude. You can\u2019t use reason in this discussion. It just won\u2019t work. No, dude, you cannot use that ring again. Just stop it. \n\nConsider saving it to pass on to any children you may have, or another family member.", "I guess I'm overly practical. Had my now husband asked me if he could use a ring from a previous relationship (that he had made, no less), I wouldn't have cared a whit. No skin off my nose as it would have meant no additional ring shopping and no extra money spent.\n\nAs it stands, my husband's ring is a $20 tungsten piece that matches my $20 tungsten piece, and my engagement ring was $50. Practical. Neither of us wear them 24/7 at any rate (my job doesn't allow for it and he has arthritic hands)", "For real. \u201cIt\u2019s not a trivial thing to make\u201d. It\u2019s not a trivial thing to get married either!", "Yeah butt plugs are a pain the the arse to recycle.", "This is in order of importance? Lol", "Man I wish I had an award to give for that one! \ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47", "I like the way you ordered things", "My husband gave me a ring that he used to propose to an ex-girl friend. Didn't care a less about the ring..just wanted to marry him. This is one of the funniest stories we tell our friends and they love it. I am still wearing the same ring and we have been married for decades.", "Wish reddit still gave out free awards.... this for sure deserved the Wholesome award lol", "Oof, you aren't wrong but you are a bit extra. Try to tone it down a bit as your rage is not proportional to what his AH behavior is.", "I recently looked up why the ring is worn on that specific finger. The ancient Egyptians thought there was a vein that ran straight from the heart to that finger. Turns out there is no such direct vein, but it stuck. (It was called the vein of love, I guess people liked that?)", "My father and stepmother reused the diamond from her first marriage's engagement ring. They figured they might as well save money on a new stone. They did get a brand new fitting for it, so it was a new ring with the old stone, completely transformed.", "Yep, exactly this. \u201cHoney, I already put in all this effort on my first wife, I don\u2019t want to do it again for you.\u201d\n\nMajor YTA.", "She\u2019s not projecting meaning onto the ring. The rings literal intended purpose was to symbolize his commitment to his previous wife. He actually made it for that reason. So.. yeah it\u2019s not her projection. Keeping a ring from a previous marriage isn\u2019t the same as repurposing it for a new one.", "You're not the only one who feels this way. He's the one that will be wearing it. And I don't blame him for wanting to wear a ring he made himself and is very proud of over a generic gold band.", "Rule of thumb, the ownership of sex toys goes to the person it was used on regardless of who bought it.\n\nIf my bf/ I bought a dildo to be used on me and then we break up, I get to keep the dildo. Maybe I'll pay him for it if he bought it and wants the money reimbursed. \n\nIf my bf or I bought a butt plug that he wants to be used on him,  he gets to keep it.", "E-MI-LY \u2026", "THIS COMMENT, YES!", "My rage is nothing compared to what his fiance' must be feeling...", "They invented the calendar, so at least they got one thing right !", "I feel like an heirloom used as a wedd8ng ring once is great. The second time it can be switched to the right hand or another finger. \n\nHowever this should always be discussed. My husband got back his mothers ring from his now ex wife. His mom mentioned it was a shame my husband gave it away ( a sibling) because it could have gone to me.  Uh, no, I dont want that cursed thing . I feel the same if it was a ring for him. \n\nA simple discussion is all thats needed and case by case can be easy.", "What you are actually doing is pushing something totally unreasonable on her to set the tone of the relationship.  You shouldn't need the internet to point out why she's upset.  I hope she figures out that at best you have no common sense and at worst you are a domineering bully and she should head for the hills either way.  Oh btw YTA.", "And if it's something he's proud of, he's more likely to wear it... because let's face it, (at least where I'm located) usually only newlywed dudes wear their rings. It's a rare day I actually see anyone around here wearing their rings (usually my office sitting supervisors, but few others). We all do all do a lot of work with our hands around here, and wearing a ring is a hazard. No one wants to risk a finger (or hand!) over a ring.", "How... how do I replace my *penis??*", "I mean... it's *my* dildo, and is only being used on me, so damn right I'm gonna take it with me to every relationship. It comes with me on every first date as my chaperone.", "Do you... not wash them adequately?\n\nIf you do, then why is it gross?", "Remember George Clooney in Burn After Reading? Marched out with his pillow.", "Mine answered to \"Thing 1 and Thing 2\".", "I\u2019d pass so hard on a marriage to someone who wants to use his wedding ring from his previous unsuccessful marriage, just gives me bad vibes and I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable with the ring being connected to his past relationship. It\u2019s like the memory of his ex on his finger 24/7.", "First step: remove", "Penis transplant. Time to level up.", "Name? Lmao", "Oh yeah if it's a person just using their own toys on themselves that's fine, but when it's meant for your partner and you move it from each relation to the next......that's where its gross", "I was referring to the guy buying you the dildo and then taking it back from you to give to his new girlfriend.  \n\nIf it is glass, it can be easily sanitized, so giving a glass dildo to the new girlfriend you bought the old girlfriend who tried it and didn't like it is technically acceptable and awkward.", "Imagine your boyfriend gifting you a pink glass plug, and he wants to take a picture of it in you; scrolling through his phone later, you find a similar picture, except it is his ex.", "Because it has literally touched another person's private parts, and you sometimes cannot trust the person you are with that they clean their toys with the correct products", "Alas, despite my undying love for him, he has not been named. ;)", "Even if it is properly cleaned and sanitised, I would feel very uncomfortable using a toy that was used by his ex. New relationship new toys (within reason ofc, like whips and handcuffs and rope don't need to be replaced but dildos and vibrators do)", "My issue there would not be with the picture.\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't have any issue with the fact of it having been used with someone else, assuming it's been adequately cleaned. \n\nI mean, his *penis* has been used with someone else", "If I didn't trust them to do that, I wouldn't be having sex with them. Certainly not with their toys.", "Might I be so bold as to suggest....Dick?\n\n\ud83e\udd23", "I'd say that's a little on the nose, but that's not one of my erogenous zones. \ud83d\ude02", "Dildo Baggins perhaps?", "\ud83e\udd23"]}
