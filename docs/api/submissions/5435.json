I 21f have been dating my bf 21m for a little over a year and have just moved in together. I have a really good job and own a $35-40,000ish toyota hilux that I use for work while my bf owns a $10,000 at most toyota surf, this information is important to the story. I make significantly more than him.\n\nSo my bf has this big idea that because my truck cost more and is \"cheaper\" to deal with that we should use it 95% of the time and only use his for short distance travels or if I didn't fill mine up which i'm fine with most of the time as this is true and his can be a bit unreliable sometimes. The problem I have is that he insists on using my truck for whatever he wants to do and when I say no he pulls the \"we are a couple and should share everything between us 50/50 blah blah \" card. Recently I found out that he took my truck off-roading through a mutual friend and when he returned it had scratches all up the drivers side and a dent on the front bonnet. I was furious. Our mutual friend said that was trying to see how much the truck could put up with and ended up losing control which lead to him sliding into a bank. He also said that he would speed down a straight and slam the brakes which would lead the truck to spin out.\n\nWhen I got home later that day I blew up at him and demanded that he help pay for the repairs that needed to be done which he refused because he was saving up to make upgrades to his own truck. I left to go to a mates house to cool down and ended up staying the night. When I checked my phone the next morning there were text messages and missed calls from him asking where I was and that he needed MY truck to do something. I refused again and didn't hear from him for the rest of the day. When I got home later that night he said he was sorry and that he wanted to take me out to dinner and that we can take his truck if I liked. I said yes and so we left with me driving his truck. When we were almost at our destination I decided to give him a taste of his own medicine and abruptly put my foot on the brake which lead to his truck stopping quite suddenly. I laughed but when I looked over at him his face was twisted in anger and he yelled at me asking how I could be so stupid and inconsiderate towards his truck...I was stunned. I quietly got out of the truck, called an uber to take me home, packed some things and went to my parents house.\n\nMy mom and his mom and the majority of our friends think he's TA but my dad and some other friends said that I'm TA and should think about how hes feeling and that his truck is a lot older than mine and more prone to breaking which is starting to make me second guess my feelings towards this whole thing. I feel like he's just using me for what I have and to get what he doesn't have.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit: There's a few comments I want to address but I can't be bothered replying to them one by one. \n\n* My truck plays a major role in what I do for work so I can't afford to not have it.\n* He has apologized before for taking my truck without asking me many times before and then trying to sugarcoat it by trying to do something nice for me and I always gave in and continues to use it after I say no or that I need it.\n* Even though I make more than him he still has a well paying job but says that he doesn't want to spend anything unnecessary as he wants to save up to upgrade his truck then sell it on and get a better one. He told me this and we agreed on paying 60/40 for our place although looking back on it he may have gaslight me a little into agreeing.\n*  He does pay for gas but only fills it up to where it was before using it. (I'm still grateful he pays for gas when he uses it)\n* I'm meeting up with his mom in a couple days to talk about a few things but she has already said that whatever I decide she will back me.", "created_utc": 1671791592, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztc6mz/aita_for_doing_the_same_thing_to_my_bf_vehicle/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's going to treat you and your stuff like this (and honestly, probably worse) forever if you stay with him.

My guess is no. Get an estimate for the damage he did to YOUR vehicle and then take him to small claims court. Completely nuke that relationship, because he doesn't care about you, he only cares about what he can get from you, in this situation, your vehicle which is clearly not as important as his baby.
