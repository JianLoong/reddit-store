I think parents forget that when they choose to remarry and take on step-children, their bio kids didn\u2019t make that same choice. Your brother can *choose* a new wife and to father her children and create more children together, but as long as your nephews aren\u2019t rude, they don\u2019t have to feel the same way. It\u2019s kind of ironic that your SIL is mad her chosen family isn\u2019t being respected whilst simultaneously denying the boys their right to choose their own family (and take a single picture).", "There is nothing wrong with the request. There can be other permutations of pictures taken as well.  It\u2019s a single picture, not a lifetime.", "NTA. How does it hurt anyone to have a photo taken at a graduation with just the direct siblings.   \n\n\nThe reality is that STEP children are not blood related and in many cases you dont form strong bonds with them as siblings.", "YTA.\n\nNot your business to jump into the middle of. The boys have their reasons for wanting it, but the stepmom and daughters also have the right to be upset about being excluded", "NTA. At every major event there are tailored photo\u2019s with different family groups. Son alone. Sons together. Sons with step kids and parents from each side. Sons with natural parents. Hell, son with GP\u2019s alone. Etc. etc. This is just really weird thinking, and you are NTA.", "Nta for advocating for him.  Being shamed for his wishes is psychologically damaging", "NTA. In fact, it's a wonderful thing that you're advocating for these boys!\n\nThe three of them have a shared experience that their step- and half-siblings don't have. They have the same two parents. They are similar in age, they started life with both parents together, then experienced divorce, remarriages, step siblings, half siblings, none of which share the same two parents these boys have, or have gone back and forth between the homes of these two parents.\n\nIt makes so much sense that they'd want a picture of the three of them with the two parents that they share. It doesn't diminish all of the other kids, who each have their own two parents. It's sad that mom and dad are so unwilling to recognize these boys as people with their own unique frames of reference and relationships, but instead insist they only be identified as part of the collective blended families.", "NTA I agree with you. It's fine the kids just want one photo with the original 5.", "NTA\n\nI am so sick of people remarrying and thinking it is somehow the CHILD's responsibility to make the family work.  The child did not choose the situation.  As long as they're being reasonably civil, that's all you're entitled to.\n\nWhen people give opinions, I normally say \"mind your own business\", but they are bringing it up to you.", "As the child of divorced parents, this is 100% a perfectly acceptable request. I did the same at my wedding. I also took pictures with my step parents and their children but I wanted a picture of my mum, dad and sister. It was taken discreetly, before I left for the venue. My step parents didn't even bat an eyelid. NTA but your brother and SIL are.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s one photo.

I hate my own parents and hadn't seen or spoken to them in a decade when my sister got married. But when she wanted a picture of all of us together I did it. It's a small ask on a special day and your brother and his ex and their spouses can adult up for a few goddamn pictures their kids will treasure. They're all selfish AHs.", "NTA, and from what I understand, the boys want a picture with only their parent at some point. Nothing has been said about more pictures with their step-parents, step-siblings or half siblings.", "NTA\n\nGeez, I thought they were going to request that people weren't invited or something like that. A simple photo and they are losing their minds? \n\nAll they have to do is take a series of photos - one with the graduate and his father's side - brotehrs, step sibs, half sis  and then one with mom and her other children and finally one of the 5 of them. \n\nLet us know when brother and SIL don't understand why son visits less and less after he graduates.", "NTA at all.

OP never said that the nephew wasn't going to be taking photos with the stepmother and stepsisters. Only that he wanted one photo with his original family. This is not an out of the ordinary request. \n\nSounds to me like stepmother has not been treating these boys as if they are HER family. It seems the expectations have been to cater to her and her daughters' feelings. She seems really selfish and entitled. She's NOT his mom - she's just a step. I have a feeling these boys are going to end up being no contact with the dad soon enough if he doesn't get a clue that his own kids have feelings too, and they are not required to accept this woman as their stepmother, neither are they required to accept these 2 girls as their step siblings.", "Lmao he's literally their blood uncle, of course he can talk and express opinion+ they were talking about that at dinner.", "Exactly how we did it when my son graduated", "Their Mom wants her kids in the picture too.", "No step mother does not bio mo", "NTA\n\nAnyone who thinks your nephew is somehow a douche for wanting a picture of HIS family is the real asshole.

This isn't outrageous at all. At weddings there are big photos with everyone, some with just siblings, some with just bride's parents, some with just groom's, one with grandparents, the bridesmaids, it goes on and on.

Nobody's being excluded, it's just one picture.", "NTA- This was my biggest fear while wedding planning bc my parents are divorced and there is a lot of hate on both sides. They divorced like 20 years ago (I\u2019m 25f) and it\u2019s still tense, plus my dad remarried and it\u2019s all a mess. I requested that they didn\u2019t have to talk or anything but that I wanted a picture with the two of them and then with my dad and stepmom. And you know what? They realized that they had a kid with real, legitimate feelings and put their feelings to the side. So I could have this ONE PICTURE as a gift. \n\nTheir parents should do the same.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nAt my brothers wedding, we had photos taken in every constellation anyone could think of and just because my sibling got a photo without any partners, that does not mean we don't want them in our family.  Same goes for pictures just with pur parents, but without grandparents or only grandparents with the newlyweds. It's one photo, one constellation. They should get over themselves", "NTA. My mom is remarried and we do this all the time. A photo worth just the \u201coriginal\u201d family, a photo with just the step family, and a photo with everyone. Very reasonable and my stepdad does not care. (Fwiw, he and my dad have a good relationship under the circumstances.)\n\nAlso, the son having to \u2018sit his parents down\u2019 so to speak to have such an unserious conversation is a poor reflection on all four parents.", "NTA. It's one photograph. Their reaction  makes it sound like they just asked to put their step siblings up for adoption. Wanting one photo with your biological family is fine.", "I\u2019m a step mum to two kids and have two of my own with my husband.

Half/step sibling's feelings don't take precedence since it isn't their milestone & there will probably be other photos taken of other family dynamics. I loathe parents who berate their kids for reminiscing about the family they used to have.", "NTA.\n\nThe kid just wants a picture with his brothers and his biological parents as a keepsake. \nHow can they be so offended at that? No one is being excluded because no one fits in that category of being the biological children of those specific two parents.", "NTA. Good for you for standing up for your nephews and their totally reasonable request. They did not choose for their parents to get divorced and have blended families. The parents chose that. This is not to say parents should never divorce. It is a totally valid and often necessary choice in everyone\u2019s best interests. But it has consequences. The boys are forced to bear the brunt of most of those consequences. A simple photo is something the parents can suck it up and give them. I think the boys showed great maturity in asking so reasonably and doing it ahead of time to avoid drama on graduation day.\n\nWhat is going to happen if any of them get married? Will they also not get the photos they want then? Coming up with photo combos for my wedding was stressful because my in laws are divorced and we didn\u2019t want drama due to someone feeling left out or slighted. At the same time, my spouse wanted pictures with his original nuclear family. \n\nKeep standing up for your nephews, OP! They need someone reasonable in their corner.", "NTA. Your nephews parente are horribly selfish people. I feel bad for him but glad you spoke up.\nMy daughter has a photo of me, her and my ex in her room, hanging above her bed. My boyfriend was the one who suggested I should frame it for her. Because that's her dad in the photo, that's her proof that she was born out of love and no matter if we got divorced or not..were still her mom and dad. We are her family. I plan for her bday next year to ask him if he and her half sisters want to do a family photo with us so she can have all of her family in one photo. Why? Because its what would make her happy. And her being happy is more important than some awkwardness or sore feelings.", "NTA - it's one photo! they're going to take a zillion different photos that day! and all this is a dry run for other major life events, like weddings and births and on and on. In the scheme of things, this is a very small, reasonable request.", "NTA, but only because you were just trying to settle the argument. And, fhd request is not outrageous. It is just not a kind request. And, for those saying the nuclear family is just the boys and their mom and dad are outrageous. Their nuclear family has expanded. They have new siblings who share dna on both sides. I wouldn't do that to my family even at the boys age because it would destroy my siblings feelings. I still include stepsiblings who are no longer stepsiblings in my life. They love me because they were raised with me. I know some kids can't get over the trauma of divorce, but there is no need to cause trauma to younger kids who love you.", "This is what drives me NUTS about divorced parents. They have a child who THEY bond to each of them as parents and then say they can\u2019t stay married bc an unhappy marriage is bad for the kids but go onto marry again and say the kids will adapt!! It doesn\u2019t matter if the kids are happy as long as the parents get what they want. \n\nSure, divorce needs to happen bc some people shouldn\u2019t be married. That\u2019s fine but THEY need to take responsibility for the family bonding they put their children through. It\u2019s not something they should ignore. \n\nA single picture isn\u2019t out of bounds and their parents are so selfish and narrow minded that it\u2019s ridiculous. I\u2019ve also really hated when people get so bent out of shape if they aren\u2019t included in a family pic with certain members if they are included in the rest of the family pics. It\u2019s so ANNOYING. \n\nIn my family, we take pics of family and friends that are close enough in frame to get photographed. Pics aren\u2019t a statement of who is favored, it\u2019s a statement of who stands still long enough and tries to keep their eyes open when the camera snaps. Imo\n\nNTA", "Snap. It\u2019s over. One picture? It hardly seems criminal.", "Parent's reaction is telling to the overarching constraints that have been placed on this family, stopping them from sharing their true feelings.\n\nI get the vibe that they've felt like they can't make requests as such to their parents in the past and that's the exact reason why they feel the need to have this photo in the first place.\n\nI'd be willing to bet, behind the scenes, these boys have been fed the notion that their original family is gone, despite everyone still being very much alive.

Who can blame them!  in either home , chances are other children are given priority, there are different rules / customs.  It must be dizzying.\n\nAfter 10 years their parents are happy and they are unaware that their 3 eldest children arn't.  Certainly they are resistant to the idea that the 3 sons could have a different experience of the past 10 years than their parents.  \n\nHow dare their children not want step siblings and half sibligns , step parents , etc etc  !", "Why cant they get photo with the 5 of them as requested then just get another picture with everyone else in it!", "NTA. I have a VERY blended family and we do this at every bigger event. My sister got married a couple of years ago.

Grandkids only.  And on and on with different combos.

They want a pic with just their mom & dad & that's ok.  I simply don't understand why anyone is giving them a hard time about this.", "NTA, it's a totally reasonable request and probably pretty common! My parents separated before I was even born, I've literally never known them to be together. I simply have two families - but I still asked for a photo with the two of them and my full-blood sister at my graduation, even though it felt weird, because I have spent my entire life split between two families and just occasionally it is nice to just have the focus on me and who made me, not on who they've chosen after me. I love my half-sisters dearly, as much as my full sister, and I am not unfond of my step-parents, one of whom I consider a parent as much as the actual parent.", "ESH. As someone with hostile older step-siblings who could never get over their father loving my mother, even though my step-siblings and I *were already adults when they met,* it does suck to always be asked to step aside for \"real family\" photos. The first time they didn't do that was at our dad's funeral, which means he never got to live to see us get along. \n\nThat being said, we always did step aside. Because you can't force a relationship where one isn't wanted.
