Your brother can *choose* a new wife and to father her children and create more children together, but as long as your nephews aren\u2019t rude, they don\u2019t have to feel the same way.

The boys have their reasons for wanting it, but the stepmom and daughters also have the right to be upset about being excluded", "NTA. At every major event there are tailored photo\u2019s with different family groups. Son alone. Sons together. Sons with step kids and parents from each side. Sons with natural parents.

In fact, it's a wonderful thing that you're advocating for these boys!\n\nThe three of them have a shared experience that their step- and half-siblings don't have. They have the same two parents. They are similar in age, they started life with both parents together, then experienced divorce, remarriages, step siblings, half siblings, none of which share the same two parents these boys have, or have gone back and forth between the homes of these two parents.\n\nIt makes so much sense that they'd want a picture of the three of them with the two parents that they share. It doesn't diminish all of the other kids, who each have their own two parents. It's sad that mom and dad are so unwilling to recognize these boys as people with their own unique frames of reference and relationships, but instead insist they only be identified as part of the collective blended families.", "NTA I agree with you. It's fine the kids just want one photo with the original 5.", "NTA\n\nI am so sick of people remarrying and thinking it is somehow the CHILD's responsibility to make the family work.  The child did not choose the situation.  As long as they're being reasonably civil, that's all you're entitled to.\n\nWhen people give opinions, I normally say \"mind your own business\", but they are bringing it up to you.", "As the child of divorced parents, this is 100% a perfectly acceptable request. I did the same at my wedding. I also took pictures with my step parents and their children but I wanted a picture of my mum, dad and sister. It was taken discreetly, before I left for the venue. My step parents didn't even bat an eyelid. NTA but your brother and SIL are.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s one photo.

This is not an out of the ordinary request. \n\nSounds to me like stepmother has not been treating these boys as if they are HER family. It seems the expectations have been to cater to her and her daughters' feelings. She seems really selfish and entitled. She's NOT his mom - she's just a step. I have a feeling these boys are going to end up being no contact with the dad soon enough if he doesn't get a clue that his own kids have feelings too, and they are not required to accept this woman as their stepmother, neither are they required to accept these 2 girls as their step siblings.", "Lmao he's literally their blood uncle, of course he can talk and express opinion+ they were talking about that at dinner.", "Exactly how we did it when my son graduated", "Their Mom wants her kids in the picture too.", "No step mother does not bio mo", "NTA\n\nAnyone who thinks your nephew is somehow a douche for wanting a picture of HIS family is the real asshole.

They divorced like 20 years ago (I\u2019m 25f) and it\u2019s still tense, plus my dad remarried and it\u2019s all a mess. I requested that they didn\u2019t have to talk or anything but that I wanted a picture with the two of them and then with my dad and stepmom. And you know what?

Same goes for pictures just with pur parents, but without grandparents or only grandparents with the newlyweds. It's one photo, one constellation. They should get over themselves", "NTA.

Half/step sibling's feelings don't take precedence since it isn't their milestone & there will probably be other photos taken of other family dynamics. I loathe parents who berate their kids for reminiscing about the family they used to have.", "NTA.\n\nThe kid just wants a picture with his brothers and his biological parents as a keepsake. \nHow can they be so offended at that? No one is being excluded because no one fits in that category of being the biological children of those specific two parents.", "NTA. Good for you for standing up for your nephews and their totally reasonable request. They did not choose for their parents to get divorced and have blended families. The parents chose that. This is not to say parents should never divorce. It is a totally valid and often necessary choice in everyone\u2019s best interests. But it has consequences. The boys are forced to bear the brunt of most of those consequences. A simple photo is something the parents can suck it up and give them. I think the boys showed great maturity in asking so reasonably and doing it ahead of time to avoid drama on graduation day.\n\nWhat is going to happen if any of them get married? Will they also not get the photos they want then? Coming up with photo combos for my wedding was stressful because my in laws are divorced and we didn\u2019t want drama due to someone feeling left out or slighted. At the same time, my spouse wanted pictures with his original nuclear family. \n\nKeep standing up for your nephews, OP! They need someone reasonable in their corner.", "NTA. Your nephews parente are horribly selfish people. I feel bad for him but glad you spoke up.\nMy daughter has a photo of me, her and my ex in her room, hanging above her bed. My boyfriend was the one who suggested I should frame it for her. Because that's her dad in the photo, that's her proof that she was born out of love and no matter if we got divorced or not..were still her mom and dad. We are her family. I plan for her bday next year to ask him if he and her half sisters want to do a family photo with us so she can have all of her family in one photo. Why? Because its what would make her happy. And her being happy is more important than some awkwardness or sore feelings.", "NTA - it's one photo! they're going to take a zillion different photos that day! and all this is a dry run for other major life events, like weddings and births and on and on. In the scheme of things, this is a very small, reasonable request.", "NTA, but only because you were just trying to settle the argument. And, fhd request is not outrageous. It is just not a kind request. And, for those saying the nuclear family is just the boys and their mom and dad are outrageous. Their nuclear family has expanded. They have new siblings who share dna on both sides. I wouldn't do that to my family even at the boys age because it would destroy my siblings feelings. I still include stepsiblings who are no longer stepsiblings in my life. They love me because they were raised with me. I know some kids can't get over the trauma of divorce, but there is no need to cause trauma to younger kids who love you.", "This is what drives me NUTS about divorced parents. They have a child who THEY bond to each of them as parents and then say they can\u2019t stay married bc an unhappy marriage is bad for the kids but go onto marry again and say the kids will adapt!! It doesn\u2019t matter if the kids are happy as long as the parents get what they want. \n\nSure, divorce needs to happen bc some people shouldn\u2019t be married. That\u2019s fine but THEY need to take responsibility for the family bonding they put their children through. It\u2019s not something they should ignore. \n\nA single picture isn\u2019t out of bounds and their parents are so selfish and narrow minded that it\u2019s ridiculous. I\u2019ve also really hated when people get so bent out of shape if they aren\u2019t included in a family pic with certain members if they are included in the rest of the family pics. It\u2019s so ANNOYING. \n\nIn my family, we take pics of family and friends that are close enough in frame to get photographed. Pics aren\u2019t a statement of who is favored, it\u2019s a statement of who stands still long enough and tries to keep their eyes open when the camera snaps. Imo\n\nNTA", "Snap. It\u2019s over. One picture? It hardly seems criminal.", "Parent's reaction is telling to the overarching constraints that have been placed on this family, stopping them from sharing their true feelings.\n\nI get the vibe that they've felt like they can't make requests as such to their parents in the past and that's the exact reason why they feel the need to have this photo in the first place.\n\nI'd be willing to bet, behind the scenes, these boys have been fed the notion that their original family is gone, despite everyone still being very much alive.

Who can blame them!  in either home , chances are other children are given priority, there are different rules / customs.  It must be dizzying.\n\nAfter 10 years their parents are happy and they are unaware that their 3 eldest children arn't.

They want a pic with just their mom & dad & that's ok.  I simply don't understand why anyone is giving them a hard time about this.", "NTA, it's a totally reasonable request and probably pretty common! My parents separated before I was even born, I've literally never known them to be together. I simply have two families - but I still asked for a photo with the two of them and my full-blood sister at my graduation, even though it felt weird, because I have spent my entire life split between two families and just occasionally it is nice to just have the focus on me and who made me, not on who they've chosen after me. I love my half-sisters dearly, as much as my full sister, and I am not unfond of my step-parents, one of whom I consider a parent as much as the actual parent.", "ESH. As someone with hostile older step-siblings who could never get over their father loving my mother, even though my step-siblings and I *were already adults when they met,* it does suck to always be asked to step aside for \"real family\" photos. The first time they didn't do that was at our dad's funeral, which means he never got to live to see us get along. \n\nThat being said, we always did step aside. Because you can't force a relationship where one isn't wanted.

It was so hard on us kids when we didn't really care about any of that.. we would have preferred everyone to get along because we wanted to hang with our mom or our dad without pressure of taking sides. The kids didn't choose this. He wants a memento with HIS family. That's a sweet idea and it's sad that dad and step mom can't suck it up. It's a PICTURE!

Some one on one - there is no need for brother and his wife to get bent out of shape - it was a request that should be honored.  Some of my cutest pics for my kids graduations were when they were with only one of their siblings.  I have some with my youngest (she made this a tradition herself) but taking off their caps and putting them on herself and then standing by herself with whomever graduated and taking a pic of that.  I have one with my kids with their father by themselves.  No need for their siblings or me to be in it. Because we had plenty where all of us got to stand with the graduate.  It is their special day.  It is about them. Not siblings or even parents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeems SIL is making this about her and her family and not about the step-son.  That is not cool.", "NTA.

They can deal with doing one with just their kids and each other.  If it helps, I imagine this is a common request! I am a steppatrent and have taken pics at special events with my husband and stepsons mom. Then i get one w stepson and my husband.  Its literally not a big deal. I even have taken pics of my stepson with siblings on moms side and dads side (my son w his dad)  together so that  he will have pics with all his siblings in them.

The solution is to take tons of pictures in every combination possible.

The whole thing blew up (alcohol was a factor I think) The kids do not speak to their dad or his wife anymore and he hasn\u2019t seen his grandkids in over a year.

There is not some weird rule we are missing here...? unless that is the case, you are NTA and I find it really strange their  reaction to such a simple request...", "This is what my half brother did at his wedding. He got photos with his in-laws, his birth parents (my dad and his ex wife), my parents, his fully biological sister, my parents and their other kids, and all of us together. It\u2019s how the events work. You take a variety of photos with different people. NTA- how insecure of them", "NTA at all! Your brother and his wife are total assholes who don\u2019t give a shit how the divorce affects their kids. I only have one photo of my dad and mom and me together when I was 1 year old.

It's a fundamental lack of understanding of what a person or consciousness or being actually even *is*.  They treat living, breathing people that they are responsible for, the same way a small dumb child plays with action figures.\n\nThere really is something about the \"why doesn't my nine year old love my new wife that they found out existed nineteen minutes ago\" that really fucks with my brain.  I just fully genuinely can't understand how someone *doesn't* understand it.", "I suppose I should have been terribly offended at the formal portrait my brother had done of himself, our father, and our nephew.

How dare they enjoy a relationship that is occasionally independent of meeeee.", "Yeah, when graduation was brought up, I thought it was going to be, the steps aren't going to be invited...but this is a photo.

They go through the motions, they don't rustle any feathers. Sometimes they're actually well adjusted and don't mind. But these boys are old enough to remember a time when their family was whole. And it's a time they can't go back to. They are old enough to remember their world splitting apart. They miss the comfort of mom and dad. They miss THEIR normal. They can't into this world this way, let them cross into adulthood with a few memories of their intact family. It's their graduation.

He gets to choose what direction his relationship is about to go. \n\nMy FIL torpedoed his relationship with my SO (his son) over this shit at our wedding.

We\u2019ve been married almost 20 years, and we are still not in good terms with his wife, and his dad did this damage because he didn\u2019t realize it\u2019s not just a photo, it was something he needed emotionally and his dad could not put his needs in front of his girlfriend\u2019s desires.  FIL has missed loads of birthdays, holidays, vacations, updates with his kid and grandkids.
