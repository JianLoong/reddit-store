My brother has two stepdaughter's (younger than his boys) and a daughter with his wife. The boys' mom has also had more children. A few weeks ago the boys asked to speak to my brother and their mom together and made a request that for the graduation (and the graduation of the younger two) that at some point they get a photo of just the five of them, so they could have a photo of just them and their parents and nobody else. My brother and SIL have not shut up about it since. They think it was outrageous and that the boys are terrible for requesting this.

I think parents forget that when they choose to remarry and take on step-children, their bio kids didn\u2019t make that same choice. Your brother can *choose* a new wife and to father her children and create more children together, but as long as your nephews aren\u2019t rude, they don\u2019t have to feel the same way. It\u2019s kind of ironic that your SIL is mad her chosen family isn\u2019t being respected whilst simultaneously denying the boys their right to choose their own family (and take a single picture).", "There is nothing wrong with the request. There can be other permutations of pictures taken as well.  It\u2019s a single picture, not a lifetime.", "NTA. How does it hurt anyone to have a photo taken at a graduation with just the direct siblings.   \n\n\nThe reality is that STEP children are not blood related and in many cases you dont form strong bonds with them as siblings.", "YTA.\n\nNot your business to jump into the middle of. The boys have their reasons for wanting it, but the stepmom and daughters also have the right to be upset about being excluded", "NTA. At every major event there are tailored photo\u2019s with different family groups. Son alone. Sons together. Sons with step kids and parents from each side. Sons with natural parents. Hell, son with GP\u2019s alone. Etc. etc. This is just really weird thinking, and you are NTA.", "Nta for advocating for him.  Being shamed for his wishes is psychologically damaging", "NTA. In fact, it's a wonderful thing that you're advocating for these boys!\n\nThe three of them have a shared experience that their step- and half-siblings don't have. They have the same two parents. They are similar in age, they started life with both parents together, then experienced divorce, remarriages, step siblings, half siblings, none of which share the same two parents these boys have, or have gone back and forth between the homes of these two parents.\n\nIt makes so much sense that they'd want a picture of the three of them with the two parents that they share. It doesn't diminish all of the other kids, who each have their own two parents. It's sad that mom and dad are so unwilling to recognize these boys as people with their own unique frames of reference and relationships, but instead insist they only be identified as part of the collective blended families.", "NTA I agree with you. It's fine the kids just want one photo with the original 5.", "NTA\n\nI am so sick of people remarrying and thinking it is somehow the CHILD's responsibility to make the family work.  The child did not choose the situation.  As long as they're being reasonably civil, that's all your entitled to.  \n\nWhen people give opinion, I normally say \"mind your own business\", but they are bringing it up to you.", "As the child of divorced parents, this is 100% a perfectly acceptable request. I did the same at my wedding. I also took pictures with my step parents and their children but I wanted a picture of my mum, dad and sister. It was taken discreetly, before I left for the venue. My step parents didn't even bat an eyelid. NTA but your brother and SIL are.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s one photo. SIL is overreacting - it would be different if they wanted to exclude them from every photo but this is a perfectly reasonable request.", "NTA. I hate my own parents and hadn't seen or spoken to them in a decade when my sister got married. But when she wanted a picture of all of us together I did it. It's a small ask on a special day and your brother and his ex and their spouses can adult up for a few goddamn pictures their kids will treasure. They're all selfish AHs.", "NTA, and from what I understand, the boys want a picture with only their parent at some point. Nothing has been said about more pictures with their step-parents, step-siblings or half siblings.", "NTA\n\nGeez, I thought they were going to request that people weren't invited or something like that. A simple photo and they are losing their minds? \n\nAll they have to do is take a series of photos - one with the graduate and his father's side - brotehrs, step sibs, half sis  and then one with mom and her other children and finally one of the 5 of them. \n\nLet us know when brother and SIL don't understand why son visits less and less after he graduates.", "NTA at all. If I were the son I would just take a pic with my Mom and biological brothers. I wouldn\u2019t bother including Dad at all but I\u2019m petty like that.", "NTA", "NTA, poor sons, what an earnest and vulnerable request to make, only to have it shut down and ridiculed", "Nta. It sounds like they're so focused on having a perfect blended family that they're pushing away your nephew. They need to sit down and figure out where this is coming from and work on it.", "Just.  One.  Photo.  \n\nThe brother and SIL reaction suggests there is way more to this story than it appears.\n\nOP is fine saying he understands.", "Of course they do. But bringing it up for weeks on end is not a great way to handle it either.", "But they're not being excluded. OP never said that the nephew wasn't going to be taking photos with the stepmother and stepsisters. Only that he wanted one photo with his original family. This is not an out of the ordinary request. \n\nSounds to me like stepmother has not been treating these boys as if they are HER family. It seems the expectations have been to cater to her and her daughters' feelings. She seems really selfish and entitled. She's NOT his mom - she's just a step. I have a feeling these boys are going to end up being no contact with the dad soon enough if he doesn't get a clue that his own kids have feelings too, and they are not required to accept this woman as their stepmother, neither are they required to accept these 2 girls as their step siblings.", "Lmao he's literally their blood uncle, of course he can talk and express opinion+ they were talking about that at dinner.", "Exactly how we did it when my son graduated", "Their Mom wants her kids in the picture too.", "No step mother does not bio mo"]}
