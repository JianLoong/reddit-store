He wasn\u2019t using his brain when he tossed you that softball. I think your reply was pretty funny.", "NTA - he said \"don't abandon your child\" regarding the cat, after having abandoned you as a child. He set it up for you to respond that way. Also he made it clear that he had no intention of coming back? Doesn't sound like he really has a right to be offended", "NTA. Maybe a \u201ctoo soon\u201d, and obviously that was a little dark, but I\u2019m team \u201cabandoned kid\u201d here.\n\nIt\u2019s not like you joked about him trying to sell the cat for heroin or whatever his addition was\u2026", "NTA not sure why he would even consider saying something like that. He has no right to be salty with you. \n\nAlso, please work on your punctuation.", "NTA at all. For the neglect and abandonment he inflicted on you, you've earned the right to that joke and that's minor in comparison. If he didn't want to be the butt of abandonment jokes, he should've done the right thing by not abandoning you during most your life.", "NTA, he\u2019s being salty because he\u2019s has no defense and it was a good one", "I'm going with NAH. \n\n> although we never properly talked about it\n\nThis situation is your sign that you two probably need to talk about it.", "NTA, but im sure he didn't appreciate it.", "I mean it was an asshole thing to say, but most of us probably feel your completely justified in saying it.", "Even though I believe you weren't joking because being abandoned has to hurt, that shit was funny as hell. After about 13 years, he only came back because your grandma needed help ? He's lucky you speak to him it at all.", "ur not the asshole. idc dads should be dads. and ur joke was real so?? yea not the asshole at all", "YTA - Yep, way out of line", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your father is a deadbeat who abandoned you as a child. Hes offended because he feels guilty about his actions. A better idea for a joke would be suing for back pay on child support for all the years he was gone assuming he owes any. That \"joke\" will have him dying.", "Nta. Play stupid games win stupid prizes. He has absolutely no room to talk about abandoning your child. None whatsoever", "He set me up for that one", "I thought so too", "Yeah that\u2019s what I was thinking but idk , I still apologized for upsetting him but he\u2019s still salty", "Probably is too soon I only moved in a couple months ago", "I appreciate that", "Lmao true ,him and I don\u2019t even interact much ,he\u2019s always kind ,and does bare necessity dad things ,but tbh I\u2019m mostly here for my grandma I love her to the moon and back and she\u2019s always been my support so I want to do anything I can to help her bc idk how long she has left", "Damn", "Thank you", "He payed child support the whole time he just went out of his way to avoid me and not contact me in any way", "I mean if he\u2019s gonna pitch straight down the middle, you\u2019re gonna swing. Idk what he was expecting. \n\nAlso as others have pointed out apparently he\u2019s made it clear he never intended to come back? If so, he has no room to talk at all here. He quite literally abandoned his child.", "Def worth apologising and I would avoid saying it again to keep the peace, but he has to understand that you are probably still somewhat hurt by what he has done and it's an awkward situation for everyone involved", "Your fathers a jerk. I don't know how a man can avoid and ignore a child they helped bring into the world. Am not convinced your father care for you any meaningful way. Likely he only reached out to you because he wants you to be a free in-home caretaker for his mom or your grandmother who's in poor health. Don't do that. Save money so you can move out. Associate with people who actually care about you.", "Nta.  Sounds apt.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nMy Dad left when I was a kid, I havnt spoken to him in a loooong time, you are totally fine and I say keep them coming.\n\nGive him hell.\n\nI hope your grandma is ok.", "My dad left for career when I was a baby to follow a professorship in another country, I'm still pissed about it at 40. I'm sure it will come up again for you.", "He told me he only came back because his brother died and was no longer caring for my grandma and he didn\u2019t want to stay but feels like he can\u2019t leave his mom bc she needs help with a lot these days", "Yikes\u2026. honestly he sounds like a piece of work I\u2019m sorry. Definitely NTA though if that somehow already wasn\u2019t clear from almost every other to comment."]}
