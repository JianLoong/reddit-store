If she\u2019s literally doing all of those takes as well Yta.  Truthfully when you snuck in your earning 4 times as much as her it\u2019s making me think Yta\u2026 if she\u2019s still working really hard and contributing I don\u2019t think it warrants sticking her with all the work.", "I\u2019d say talk to your wife, ask her if she thinks you are.

Getting the chores done when you both have outside jobs is both your jobs, not just one person\u2019s. However, there are lots of chores in a household, not just cooking, especially when you have a child. How are all the chores, including cooking, child care, cleaning & everything else, divided? Would your wife say that the two of you spend equal time on chores & that the mental load is evenly divided? If so, you\u2019re not TA. In the meantime, I vote INFO.", "NTA. I\u2019m a chronic migraine sufferer with numerous sensitivities and over 10 IgE-confirmed food allergies ranging from mild to severe. I absolutely adjust what I can eat on a daily basis depending on how I feel, and I use a ton of ingredients and spices that aren\u2019t common in the US to make up for the lack of onion, garlic, butter, etc. I do 100% of the cooking in our household and frankly, it is conflict-inducing when my husband tries to help because he inevitably thinks I\u2019m messing with him when I tell him what is ok or is off limits that day, and he doesn\u2019t know how to use the often expensive \u201calternate\u201d ingredients. Him trying to take a more active role, even if well intentioned, is not something that would benefit either of us. \n\nIf your wife complains, then yes, you should work together to reallocate responsibilities. But it isn\u2019t up to anyone else to insert their judgments into the situation. \n\nThis does give you an opportunity to reassess whether your current breakdown is equitable, however. If you realize she is doing more, I\u2019d suggest finding chores to make your own. For example, because I do all the cooking and kitchen cleaning, my husband takes exclusive responsibility for cleaning the bathrooms and folding/putting away the laundry. I hate both of those chores, so it\u2019s a great distribution of work in my opinion!", "Okay so I\u2019ve read all your responses and I\u2019m totally on board with why it\u2019s not reasonable for you to cook for her. Tbh, if you asked her if she WANTED you to cook for her I think there\u2019s a good chance she\u2019d say no. So I guess NTA for the question. But I do think you should talk to her and ask for her honest opinion on the division of labor and make sure she\u2019s happy with the split. If she is, great! If she\u2019s not, there are tons of household tasks that would not have this issue. She might even appreciate you cooking for yourself more often if it is easier for her to just cook for herself and not for both of you.\n\nIt sounds like your job is super busy and stressful, so it makes sense your brain is dead at the end of the day. But basic things like eating, cleaning your clothes, cleaning your living space, etc are things we ALL have to do for ourselves when we\u2019re living alone, and having a partner doesn\u2019t change the fact that it\u2019s your responsibility to kinda get yourself physically through life. Couples can choose to readjust those responsibilities when it makes sense, which it sounds like you\u2019ve done. But there\u2019s a difference between \u201cmy partner takes on more of this part of our shared load and I do this other part\u201d and \u201cmy partner is the person who is responsible by default for the things I don\u2019t have time to do.\u201d I can\u2019t tell which scenario y\u2019all are in. She would definitely know so you should ask her.\n\nEDIT: After thinking about it more and reframing it in my frame as a coworker dispute rather than an issue with wife, the way your coworker is behaving is really inappropriate and you probably need to speak to your boss about it. And going forward always describe your division of labor as \u201cMy wife does the cooking because of her autoimmune disease. I take on other household tasks that aren\u2019t so dependent on her health.\u201d Everyone is REALLY getting in the weeds on the division of labor thing, myself included, and I think you can head that off by changing the way you speak about it. If you\u2019re not speaking about it this way at work then that could explain your coworkers overreaction, although it is STILL inappropriate.", "NTA as long as the division of chores overall is balanced and you both agree about that.  If your wife has no issue then there isn't one.  Your coworker can butt out.", "NTA. What works for you and your wife won't apply to everyone else's relationship and vice versa.

If your wife thinks it's unfair she does all the cooking, which it sounds like she *needs* and wants to do all the cooking regardless, then that's something you should discuss amongst yourselves. A co-worker who, theoretically knows little about your wife and household dynamic, has no right to get on your case simply because of how they feel things should be done.", "NTA but you're coming off as an entitled jerk, bringing in how much you make.  The reality is that her taking on more house maintenance and cleaning allows you to work long hours.  Her diet could be a pain to learn, but if you can't cook a couple time's a week, you should be helping more with other things like laundry and cleaning.  Very least on weekends you should give your wife child free time.    As you make 4x what your wife makes, could you at least pay for someone to lighten the load? \n\nHave you considered what happens if you ever end up having a special diet due to health issues?  Just remember neither of you have to cook for each other.     If she decides she doesn't want to cook for you in the future,  then that is also her right. Would you be OK with her refusing to cook for you? If you're not, I would reconsider and learn to cook for my partner.", "Nta for not cooking, given how complex her needs are, but maybe there are other areas you can help with?
