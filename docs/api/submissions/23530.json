These are a really big deal for us, it was the biggest ordainment service since 1980s, there were roughly 400 people there, and as a part of it I'm called forward to profess my faith and gain the support of the Church. Formal Commission is a Chaplains version of Ordainment, and I've spent the last year working towards it. Its essentially a public promotion.\r  \n\r  \nMy fiancee (F27) and my family came to watch. Her family were going to come, but they decided against it as they find Church boring and her sister who is unwell gets tired quickly (I completely understood, for many Church is boring). We decided to do a BBQ after the service where we'd catch up and they would congratulate me as we do a weekly dinner with them on Sundays anyway. My fiancee had asked how long the service would be so they could plan, and I said \"roughly an hour and a half I'm not sure\".\r  \n\r  \nThe service went on for two hours.

I told her no, I have to stay until the dismissal. I was also supposed to stay after to go and thank my colleagues and Church at an informal meal, but I didn't because I knew she was upset.

She said it wasn't fair to make her family wait, and that I placed no appreciation or value on their time. I told her that the commissioning was a once in a lifetime event that I'd been planning for months, so it was incredibly important to me, and that I also had no control over the length (the Bishop was in charge of the event.). She asked \"What about my family and their time? Is that not important?\" to which I replied \"Our weekly barbecue with your family is not as important as a once in a lifetime commissioning\". \n\nWe went to the barbecue, but are still arguing about this.\r  \nShe said I don't value time with her family, I told her she's right that I didn't value today's barbecue as much as my commissioning.

It was a long journey and one to be commended. \n\nIm sorry your GF sees so little value in your achievement that she couldn\u2019t be bothered to attend the ceremony and bugged you via text during the ceremony. \n\nA standard, weekly event DOES NOT supersede a once in a lifetime event. Both your GF and her family owe you an apology. \n\nHonestly, this situation would be a deal breaker for me.", "NTA. You told your fianc\u00e9 you weren\u2019t sure when the service would end. When her family set the time for the barbecue, they should have factored in the possibility the service would run long or that you would be delayed greeting people or taking pictures afterward. The main event was the service and the barbecue was the after party. Your fianc\u00e9\u2019s family chose to skip the main event and when you do that you shouldn\u2019t be surprised when you end up waiting for the guest of honor to show up to the after party. Your fianc\u00e9 was being unreasonable.

Wish you had more considerate future in laws.", "NTA and your fiancee acted like one.\nSeems like she felt uncomfortable because her relatives were tired or bored or hungry \u2014 and she let it come first.

You did your best in estimating the service and you can acknowledge that.  At the same time, the BBQ could have taken the same time and finished later than usual.  What may be happening is that your fiance is getting grief from her family and is trying to figure out how she can tell them that \"I spoke to him and he is sorry about what happened\" or some such thing.  What needs some thinking on your part is that (a) fiance somehow does not take at face value what is important to you and make it important to her (b) does not defend you or at least explain the situation to her family that you did your best to estimate the length of the service but it took longer than expected and it is end of story right there.\n\nEngagement that leads to marriage then leads to marriage when despite your best intentions, things won't work out as planned.  Are you going to get this level or even larger level of grief every time your good intentions end up not 100% accurately reflecting what happens in the future?  If yes, time to rethink the fiance.", "NTA OP, you will get some push back though from the anti religious bigots on reddit.  I do not share your beliefs, just that tolerance requires me supporting you having said beliefs.  Not even a close call, this is way more important than a BBQ. And you should have stayed after to see your friends.", "NTA - So the service was only 1/2 hour over your estimate, and your fiancee was pissed? I have a feeling this argument from her is not about the time, but that she does not value or even understand your achievement. (And congratulations on that - fantastic!). This does not make sense to me.", "NTA and you need to reflect long and hard as her reaction is very telling - if you are truthful with yourself you will see she is not the one as she isn\u2019t acting as a true supportive partner", "NTA. As long as you made it clear that you didn't know how long it would take - as it seems you did - then she has nothing to complain about. It was rude to make you feel like you had to leave early.

Calling him is difficult, demanding a time frame for the service for a BBQ feels incredibly selfish to me. The reason 350-400 people were there was to celebrate their family and friends being ordained. It does feel a bit rude to ask a timeframe, and demand adherence to it, when I'm one person out of 400.

Also if people want to talk and congratulate after the service that\u2019s also not a set time. \n\nI do think OP should have thought it through and taken 2-3 hrs to make sure there was time for photos, talk etc. after the service.

You have to get support from your colleagues because your fiance, your future wife, doesn't give you the support you need.

In between those sections the Bishop would address everyone, share stories, or encouragements. \n\nThe Bishop didn't set up the event alone, he was supported by other Bishops, Arch-Bishops, and the Arch-Deacon of our diocese. But regardless they did not, and could not, put a hard time limit on the service. We had to get through everything, and on top of the the Bishop spoke freely. Also, again, in terms of seniority I'm nowhere near that level. I have no right to demand a schedule, and to dictate time to others. I am junior Clergy. \n\nI appreciate the complexity of trying to arrive on time to a BBQ, and I'm definitely regretful for how things played out, but I posted here trying to gauge whether or not I was an AH for staying instead of leaving early when our Church philosophy requires a dismissal from the Bishop to end and officiate ceremonies.", "The family had been told that I wasn't sure how long it would take, but we'd be there after. \n\nAs for whether I should be in a Church or not, you're entitled to that opinion. But its certainly not one we're going to agree on, so I feel like maybe you're coming at this with a major bias.", "To be clear, their daughter is an adult not a child.", "My wife and I have different beliefs and we have been married for over 40 years.  It is called tolerance and having an open mind.", "This has nothing to do with his faith.  He was being promoted and honored at his job and his partner instead of being supportive and proud of him she was upset she was missing a BBQ. \n\nWhat if this was his college graduation and she was mad it took to long would you advise him not to get his master's. \n\nThis has 0 5o do with religion and just an unsupported/selfish partner", "As someone who\u2019s pretty firmly atheist, if I were engaged to someone doing the positive and compassionate work you\u2019re doing I\u2019d support them unreservedly. Your work is rooted in a desire to help others and sounds objectively awesome of you. She doesn\u2019t have to have exactly the same beliefs as you do, but does she have the same values?

Perhaps you can offer OP and his fianc\u00e9e more advice on how to be more tolerant on this matter. I recall as a boy going to night school that oftentimes advice from couples who have been married in the church longer have helped young or soon to be marriages. Personally, I feel like it reads as both are caught between her family and his job, and it may test their relationship without outside intervention. Both seem to have communication issues, mostly regarding compromise. A reasonable compromise would've been for the fianc\u00e9e to inquire about the whole event from OP. It's not like a timeframe, but morseo is a rundown of everything he is responsible for. That way, she could've made the proper judgment call and rescheduled the BBQ or pushed it to late dinnertime (830pm-9pm). Also, it shows she's more invested in what he does, but also she can communicate how important these BBQs are for herself and he can gain a better perspective on how much she wants to be around her family. The inappropriate texting during the event was also something they should address as well in counseling. There's no need for that, trust your partner more, and have patience but also humility and understanding.", "Who clearly isn't as enthralled with the faith as he is, being made 2nd choice to an intangible force probably hurts, but with someone on the same page, OP wouldn't have to worry. If they wanna work on their communication, that's one thing they can do, but again, faith is a huge part of OPs life and not his fianc\u00e9e. Be it religion or a master's degree, if she is not happy or OP is unhappy with how she's handling it, then when does the other shoe drop?", "Thank you my friend \ud83d\ude4f I'm in a really secular country, so this kind of thing wasn't ever a huge consideration for me.", "Oh I asked the Arch-Deacon much earlier on in the piece and he gave the same answer I gave her. \"Last time it took about an hour and a half, but there are more people this time so I'm not sure. It depends on how much speaking Bishop -redacted- does.\" That's what the basis of my response was on. But I asked him for an estimate, not a hard schedule, because there are no hard schedules.", "No, canceling dinner was never an option - and that wasn't my decision :) \n\nI truly wish all the best for you, stay safe out there.", "You are assuming that I agree with your assumption.  It was a BBQ vs a major life event.  It would be like leaving my wife's college graduation to watch a TV show.

I think months of preparation stands a lot more than a short time of waiting. It's not like they've been waiting the whole 3 hours. The ceremony ended up a little later than what you expected.

There seems to be no care towards something that is so important for someone she seemingly cares about.\n\nHonestly, I really would think about this. Doesn't matter if she's great with other things, if she can't/won't celebrate your faith, that's not going to bode well. What you believe makes up your value system, and if she can't share that with you by sitting through one damn service of importance to you, you need to reconsider things. \n\nHell, I can sit through church services for big moments for the ones I love. Because I love them. \n\nThe amount of childrens' plays I have sat through for family that went longer than planned, where I would rather tear my hair out than be there but I suck it up because I care about my sister and her kids.

You're still a young man; remember that physical beauty is fleeting and inner beauty is forever. You need a partner/wife who will show kindness to others when she accompanies you occasionally in your work. Unfortunately, it is not apparent from this message that she is kind to others, other than her own family members. We should judge others on how they treat the cleaning people or the people your organization serves, not only by how we treat our nearest and dearest. The ppl in your ceremony were casual collateral damage for her; their feelings and your own were nothing to her. Perhaps she is immature and a decade from readiness for marriage; more likely, she lacks that inner beauty that you seem to possess. Don't go through with the wedding until you're sure she is kind to strangers.", "Does OP suck bc he left the ppl who drove in to support him high and dry after the ceremony, by cutting out with crass, selfish and immature GF?

Your fianc\u00e9e should be supporting you, celebrating you and be proud of you. \nThis isn\u2019t a spiritual incompatibility, this is your fianc\u00e9e being a selfish, immature AH\n\nAnd massive congratulations OP on your achievements and your care for others."]}
