Next week when the funeral happens is he staying there for another week with his step brother, my husband said because he needs to be there for him. I suggested he video call with his step brother to be there for him, but he said he needs to be there and I'm being unsupportive of him.

The chances of something happening that you need him for are so much more for a full week than just 1-2 days. \n\nI would suggest if you do have a close friend or family member who can come stay with you, and if there are enough direct flights between locations that he could come back easily if something happens, let him go to the funeral itself. But arrange things so he isn\u2019t gone any longer than necessary. (No more than 2 nights)\n\n(Btw- regardless of being nauseous, most doctors would not be cool with you flying after 36 weeks except extreme circumstances.)", "INFO Have you asked him if he'd consider going to the funeral and not staying for a whole week?", "If he was flying quickly in and out, that would be one thing. Flying out when you are 37 weeks and then staying another full week is definitely not the same. Your baby can come at literally any time now. I never made it to 37 weeks with any of mine. \n\nYes, it is a funeral of someone very important to his brother. Yes, he wants to support him. The extended travel plans are not the way to do that right now. \n\nNTA", "NTA because of the plan to go for a WEEK. My water spontaneously broke at home at 37 weeks and my baby came 12 hours later. I had a very uneventful pregnancy.\n\nHe might not understand that he might miss the birth. My husband and I were acting like the due date was agreed upon by the baby, so we sure were surprised and not ready.\n\nIf it were my husband and he was adamant about going, which I do get, I would ask him to only go for the night or two max, and I would have a friend or family member aware of the situation on standby. Anything can happen at this point!", "Info: What's his plan if/when you go into labor? Can he get back within a few hours? Will he be able to forgive himself for missing the birth of his child if he can't get back in time? Will you be able to forgive him?\n\nIt's really terrible timing and I feel for both of you. I think you guys need to sit down together and look at all the possible scenarios and decide what you can and can't live with.", "What about compromising to letting him go but only staying for 2 or 3 days. I mean, he could get on a plane at any time, no?", "NTA. I\u2019m very concerned that everyone is skipping over the fact that you\u2019ll be 37 weeks pregnant when he leaves and he will stay away for a week, making you 38 weeks pregnant. This means you\u2019ll be alone, ready to pop for a week.\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t go on this trip and if he does go, it should be for 1 day. He can pay respects, see the family, and then come home to be with the family he chose to create.", "NTA. Life happens. So it sucks that the funeral is at this point in your pregnancy. If I was your husband, I would struggle with how I could get to the funeral and be back home quickly. But even if I could do it in a single day, I would be concerned about the chance of you going into labor. \n\nBut it\u2019s goes completely into asshole territory with his plan to stay so long. You and the baby are his family, and should always take priority. His siblings (step or not), parents, etc are all behind the people who he chose.", "NTA. You'll be 38 weeks pregnant by the time he gets back? Is anyone proclaiming OP TA actually doing the pregnancy math here? She could literally go into labor at any point during the week he's gonna be gone for.", "NTA - he should go for a day or two however. This is very important for him to attend however a week away with how far along you are is a bit ridiculous. make a back up plan for the birth just in case, but he can always visit after.", "INFO so you are currently 36 weeks, the funereal is next week so you would be 37 weeks and then he would stay a week which would put you at 38 weeks?", "NTA, but only because of how far along you are--\n\nI looked it up and babies can be expected anywhere between 37-42 weeks, but usually 40. \n\nSo, next week-37\n\nStaying for another week-38\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's cutting it dangerously close, and never mind following the due date, babies almost never arrive on that day. \n\nIf he really REALLY insists on attending, he should go for just the 1 day (fly in that morning or the evening before, and fly out that evening or the morning after).", "NTA leaving at 37 weeks is questionable as is because you could go into labor at any point but staying for a week is crazy, if he wanted to spend one night after you got a check from your OBGYN like the day or two prior then okay but a whole week that close to the end??? Just no", "If he were attending the funeral and flying right back, I could understand. But staying for a week when your wife is due to give birth any day is not OK. \nNTA", "That\u2019s crazy.

He\u2019s lost his mind. NTA but he is if he plans to be gone for two weeks in your last 4 weeks of pregnancy.", "I would say going for one or 2 days would be reasonable but not the whole week. \n\nIs there an option that your husband would go for 2 days and return with brother? Changing the scenery might help him too during those first days and you will still have your husband around for help", "I think the compromise is he goes for the funeral but doesn\u2019t stay for the week after. You\u2019re too far along for solo week long trips, regardless the reason. I think people have this perspective that the risk of childbirth is voided by modern medicine and nothing terrible could possibly happen should you go into labor early. I understand your husband wanting to provide support to his stepbrother, so maybe convey that it\u2019s not an either-or situation, it\u2019s a priorities situation. NTA.", "NTA 36 weeks pregnant isn't a joke. I gave birth to my first at 36 weeks (healthy 8lbs!). And the next two were both two weeks early. Yes, everyone is different, but that doesn't make it right for him to not be there for you now.\n\nTaking that into account and considering everything you're going through, not wanting him to go is understandable. I think he should go for the actual funeral, but it's unreasonable for him to stay for more than a couple of days at the most. You and your little one should be his first priority here.", "What do you mean \"in case anything happens\"? You're 9 months pregnant, what will happen is that your child will be born! Does your husband know the math? NTA in the slightest.", "NTA. It is one thing for him to go out for the funeral to lend support, but the week after that is a no go for me. You'll be 38 weeks pregnant, and that's close enough to make anyone nervous.", "I'd say him going to the funeral for 2-3 days would be fair. I'd also line up someone for you to have on call if you need it.", "I was ready to say you're TA until I read the part about about him staying for another week when you're due any day.\n\nNTA. You and his child are his main responsibility. It would be different if he were flying there for the funeral and right back after a day or two. But a whole week? No. That's not cool.", "Info: Can y\u2019all come to a comprise of him going for 2-3 days?\n\nYour concerns are valid, you can deliver birth at anytime and you need support during that time.\n\nHis concerns are valid, he wants to be there for his brother and he should be.\n\nIt\u2019s a touch spot to be in when one life is gone but another one has arrived. Like I want to be happy with this new baby but I must also show some sadness and sympathy for the person that just lost someone.", "NAH\n\nNeither of you are 100% wrong. Him wanting to support his brother is completely valid, but it\u2019s also understandable for you to need his support. 36 weeks is very far along and you never know what could happen. I went to my OB at 37 weeks just for an ultrasound and ended up having my baby that day. \n\nI\u2019d say come to a compromise of him going the day before the funeral and staying until the night of. Then, he\u2019ll only be gone one night and that\u2019s a very small window for something to happen with the baby.", "NAH\n\nYou're so far along that you could go into labor at any moment.  Wanting your husband there is reasonable.\n\nHis family had a death and he's not wrong to want to be there for the funeral.  \n\nYou two need to compromise here.  He does need to be there for family.  So flying out the day before the funeral, and flying back the day after the funeral is a reasonable compromise.  Staying longer than that is unreasonable.", "NTA you could go into labor today. He\u2019s risking missing the birth of his child for this funeral. I get that he wants to be there, flying out for a days or two would have been a more reasonable request. Still a risk, but a more reasonable risk. An entire week past the funeral is way too long at this point in the pregnancy.", "I was so confused why there was so many mixed responses on this, and then I see I'm way early compared to usual.\n\nNAH imo. \n\nYou're 36 weeks pregnant which, if I did my math right, means you're due any day now? Super reasonable why you'd want your partner to be with you for the *birth of your child.*\n\nOn the flip side, he feels the need to support his family in a time of emotional tragedy. No-one's an asshole here, it's just really unfortunate timing.", "You 2 need to compromise. He should go to support his brother but for a few days only, not a week.", "I was leaning towards NAH until I saw that he wants to stay an extra week. That would be when you are 38 weeks pregnant, which I would NOT be comfortable with at all. \n\nDoes he not care about the possibility of missing the birth? \n\nAlso, he needs to understand that pregnant mothers can often need extra physical and emotional support in the days leading up to birth. \n\nHe seems completely focused on supporting them, and is dismissing your needs an concerns.", "NTA. Caveat- he goes to funeral for 48hours with a known flight time as a bailout point just in case. \nMy grandma missed my sister\u2019s birth in the exact same situation (not as bad since it\u2019s grandma and not DAD missing the birth). Born at 37 weeks. My husband used to work out of town and the last month of pregnancy for me, his boss let him work locally so he could leave at a moment\u2019s notice. For the birth of our son, only a 90min drive to get home vs 14hr or plane ride", "NAH. Your baby, your husband's child, could show up at any point. I went into labor at the end of week 36. My mother at 34 & 38 weeks, my friend at 40, 41, & 35  weeks. I missed several family funerals due to not being able to travel, it was miserable. \n\nA compromise would be going for the funeral and coming back the day after IF you have adequate support while he is gone and someone on hand with medical power of attorney should something happen to you and the baby while he's gone. Going and staying a week, is not possible right now due to the baby. Your husband can be upset at the situation but he should not be upset with you. He could set up a meal train or order some meals to go to his step brother's house, as a way to support him while not being able to be there in person. \n\nThe baby can show up at any point in time now. Going and staying for a week is a game of chance. And if you dont' go into labor, your husband sounds like he's going to be mad at you for him staying home and doing the right thing. \n\nI will also say, my partner was pretty taken aback when I went into labor early. They seemed to think the \"40 weeks\" was a certainty no matter how many times I said, it could happen at any point from now until 40 weeks and if it doesn't then we have a problem.", "INFO would you be amenable to him being gone for two or three days rather than a full week? Or do you not want him to go at all?", "Fly, and stay for a whole week? That's an AH move. An acceptable compromise would be to fly out for the funeral one day and come home again the next.\n\nSo, NTA. Husband needs to think of his immediate family responsibilities, which is that you're about to have his baby.", "I get the being there for the funeral part. The staying an extra week to support him? Not so much.\n\nNTA", "NAH I\u2019d be nervous about my partner leaving at this point in the pregnancy, but I also get him wanting to stay and support his step brother. Maybe he could go but not stay a full week? How quickly could he get back if you went into labor?It\u2019s kind of no-win for both of you. If he goes and you have the baby he\u2019ll feel bad but if he stays and you don\u2019t have the baby you might feel bad.", "NAH. Labor can begin at 37 weeks, and he plans to be gone through your 38th week. Can you call your OB and have her explain the possibility of labor starting while he wants to be away? \n\nHaving said that, I think a compromise would be for him to travel to attend the funeral, and return the next day. Of course he wants to support his stepbrother, but you\u2019re about to pop. He must consider you as well.", "NAH. You could go into labour at any moment, but it\u2019s also reasonable that your husband wants to be there to support his step-brother during this awful time. \n\nI know it\u2019s not a perfect solution, but can he fly in just for the day? A week away when you\u2019re full-term is not ok.", "It\u2019s a funeral yes but him staying until you\u2019re 38 weeks is pretty dicey. It\u2019s one thing if he flies in for the funeral and flies out, it\u2019s another to stay an entire week. \n\nNAH because his desires are completely justifiable and understandable. I hope there\u2019s a middle ground here and he can go just for the day/night of the funeral.", "NAH. Is it possible that he leaves ASAP to be with his stepbrother and then comes home a couple of days after the funeral?", "NTA I\u2019m sorry but as far along as you are your husband shouldn\u2019t be leaving you for a week. 1-2 days then I\u2019d say suck it up but not for a week. I understand this is a super sucky situation but a week is just too much at this point.", "NAH\n\nI get both sides here. It\u2019s really inconvenient timing here. You\u2019re really close to giving birth and it\u2019s natural to want your husband there but he\u2019s also possibly grieving and wanting to grieve with his step brother and comfort him. \n\nI think the middle ground would be to let him go the funeral, maybe stay a day and come back ASAP.", "NTA. Staying a week after is the tipping point. \n  Would you be open to the brother staying with you after for a week to get away? Maybe that could be an option?", "I wonder how your husband will feel if he misses the birth of his child because that is something he is clearly willing to roll the dice on. It\u2019s lovely to attend the funeral and show support but he also needs to recognize that it\u2019s a possibility you will give birth while he\u2019s away", "NTA\n\nPart of your spouse\u2019s role at the birth, which nobody likes to think about, is making medical decisions for you and the baby if you become incapacitated. It can happen. A delay getting in contacting him, a missed flight, one or both of you in critical condition? He definitely should not travel. It\u2019s sad, because he loves his brother, but he is responsible for and to you in ways a friend or doula can\u2019t be.", "Soft NAH\n\nI can give a little perspective.\n\nI lost my SIL a few months back.  My brother was a mess and understandably so.  I stayed with him about a week just to make sure he ate, bathed and took care of stuff.\n\nBut, there is nothing saying that I was the only person that could have done so. Compromise and ask if he can stay a couple of days and then have someone else be with the brother. Companionship is important right now.\n\nCompanionship is very important for you too, though. 3 or 4 days away for him and you two find someone willing to be with you step in in case the baby wants to come.\n\nThis is not a time to say \"I am most important\".  This is a time to say, \"or family is in need in two very important ways.  Let's solve this together.\"", "I\u2019d say NTA. I was ESH  before he said he was staying an extra week. A compromise is better maybe like 3 days.", "NTA I had my baby at 37 weeks. That's full term. Your husband needs to be there for you. Yes, his brother needs support, but it doesn't have to be your husband. I don't think I could get past the resentment if my husband made the choices your husband is making.", "NTA.  A quick overnight for the funeral itself might be okay, but a week\u2019s stay is too much when you\u2019re that far along.", "NAH. This is obviously a terrible situation and the timing makes is worse for your husband. I think maybe there could be a compromise like he goes for the funeral and comes right back and there\u2019s a plan in place for what happens if you go into labor while he\u2019s gone.", "I\u2019m torn because you both have very valid arguments but I do think that there is a compromise. I am making the assumption that the step brother lives within 6 hours away by flights and not more than that. I am also making the assumption that if you were to go into labor while he is gone, you\u2019ll have someone there to help you. I think that if you can figure out a way for your husband to go to the funeral, stay one day, and come back that would be the best solution.  I do not think it is reasonable at all for him to stay an extra week. That is ridiculous. \n\nNAH", "I gave birth at 36+1 weeks, so NTA. Maybe a quick trip, just one day to the funeral is ok, but risky.", "Neither is an Asshole, but I suggest a compromisse, where he goes to the funeral, and maybe stays a day or 2 but then returns.\n\nMaybe sb can stay with you a day or 2 just in case.", "I don\u2019t feel comfortable assigning a solid NTA or YTA for this situation because I can see where you both are coming from.  I think him going to the funeral is fine but staying the extra week is not.  Is this perhaps a compromise you both could come to?  I agree that with how far a long you are, he should definitely not be away for long but I do think it\u2019s important he is there to support his brother at the funeral.", "There's no reason why he can't stay 2 days and come home.\nNTA. Hubby has a huge responsibility to be with you. He's being a selfish a hole", "NTA. He can go to the funeral but you\u2019re full term and can give birth any time. There no reason for him to stay a week.", "NTA. I had perfectly normal healthy pregnancies, and both kids were born at 37 weeks. They were perfectly fine and I was lucky to only labor about four hours with each of them.", "NTA. Hmm, he's being unsupportive of his 36 weeks pregnant wife.\n\nIdeally, you'd give birth with 40 weeks, but it's pretty common for labor to start at 38 or even 37 weeks. So he wants to risk missing the birth?\n\nEdit: is it a long flight? maybe he can go for the funeral and stay 2 days? \n\nSince the funeral is next week you'll be at 37 weeks and he wants to stay for a week, so I do think there's a risk of him not being there during birth", "I think what would be fair is to let your husband go for the funeral but have him take the next flight out. That way he can support his step brother but be back with you sooner. I feel like that is a fair compromise. The loss of a loved one is never easy and I think if he has a close relationship to his step brother then that\u2019s very important. \n\nI can\u2019t speak to your pregnancy. Has it been complicated ? Is babe supposed to make it term ? I know you never know- my babe came at 37 weeks, and I had no indication of early labour at all, but i feel like it\u2019s unlikely ?! \n\nI would let him go for the funeral only. Also how long would the flight be ? Can you come back pretty easily or are we talking west to east coast ?", "NAH. I\u2019d compromise and ask him to only go out for a day or two just for the funeral since you are so far along, definitely not for a whole week.", "NAH. I had my baby at 38 weeks so I completely understand wanting him there. But at the same time this is a huge thing, his brother is grieving and I understand him wanting to be there for his family. An extra week is way too long to be gone away from his extremely pregnant wife tho. He should go to the funeral and come  right back, or even stay just a couple of days.", "NAH here. It is a shit situation. But I do think there can be a bit of compromise from your husband on how long he stays, I think he can cut it shorter. I also think you should get the number of a good midwife or doula for support or emergencies during those few days.", "NTA, ~50% of babies are born spontaneously between 38 and 40 weeks so what is he thinking? If he catches anything while travelling he will most likely not be allowed in the hospital with you, and you\u2019ll be giving birth alone. So I would plan for him having a week of \u201csafety buffer\u201d between possible birth (earliest) and getting back in case he gets sick! !", "NTA. Your concerns are valid. I had a relatively easy pregnancy, but when I went to my 37 week appointment, I found out I had to have a c-section during my doctor\u2019s next available surgery slot. You just never know what\u2019s going to happen that late in a pregnancy.", "NTA he can go for 2-3 days. A week is cutting it close but he should go for support.", "NTA, he doesn\u2019t need to spend a week there when you\u2019re going to be close to 38 weeks. \n\nHe could stay for a couple of days and be back in time just in case the baby is early.", "NTA - I had my son at 36 weeks.  My sister who was my support person missed it because she was on a quick trip to visit a friend. She thought since it was 4 weeks to go it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal.  She missed the birth. However your husband might be OK taking the risk of missing the birth. He could go for the funeral and come back after a few days that\u2019s a reasonable plan but going for two weeks is not appropriate when you are this pregnant.", "I'd compromise\n\n\nI dont think its fair for him to have to miss a funeral on the off chance you might go into labor\n\n\nI also dont think its fair for him to leave for weeks when you're close to your due date. That changes the situation. \n\n\n\nI'd say tell him to go for a night. Fly the morning of the funeral, go to the event, stay the night with family, then fly back the next day.\n\n\n\nI think that's a reasonable compromise\n\n\nNAH", "Someone needs to put this in the right perspective to get it through his head. Clearly he thinks his bro needs him more than his pregnant wife.\n\nBut would he feel the same way if someone asked him if staying with his brother for a week is worth possibly missing the birth of his child. Does he want to be there for his brother more than his kid?", "NTA. I see both sides, and I think a fair compromise would be for him to only stay for a few days. The more I think about it, the crazier it is for him to suggest being gone for two weeks, when you're pretty much full term. There's at least a 50% chance you'll have the baby in the next two weeks.", "Nta. Babies can come very early. Mine did. You would be 37 weeks when he flies away and he wants to stay for a week. \nNo that doesn't sound like a very solid plan. He needs to prioritise his wife and kid right now.", "Those saying YTA do you guys even have kids and how many of you were pregnant? \ud83d\ude44 I can't imagine most guys would leave their pregnant wife who is almost full term alone. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Maybe just me. \n\nI think everyone involved is NAH but maybe come up with a compromise (he goes and flies back the same day or within 24 hours. He goes but someone you are close to (parent or sibling etc) comes to stay the entire time.\n\nYou could be fine or you could end up in hospital, lots of variables so just come up with a compromise if you can.", "NTA\n\nAll the Y T A comments are absolutely ridiculous. Two things can be true at once people! Yes you can compromise by saying he goes to the funeral, but the extra week when you could go into labor at literally any moment from today even, is excessive. Seems like this man is already trying to checkout from fatherhood.", "Edit (NAH)  \n\nYou are N-T-A. It is a really crappy situation though. A week is too long with a pregnant wife that\u2019s that far along. \n\nPeople have said it right- he can go and take less time. I\u2019m a future time the step brother will need support too. Maybe invite him to stay at your or suggest another time your husband can go out to see him after the baby is born and you may prearrange help. \n\nIt could be that he knows his step brother could be  in a more suicidal spot and he doesn\u2019t want to worry you. It\u2019s absolutely devastating to lose your partner and everything that could have been. Your husband may likely feel pressure to be extra supportive because of how well your life together is going (hence the week) \n\nIt\u2019s incredibly caring of him to want to support his brother. He sounds like a good man trying to do the right thing. NAH.", "I think he should go, but definitely only for a day or two.

That is unreasonable.", "NTA you\u2019re in the window of it could really be anytime I had my baby shower at 35 weeks and one week later was in the hospital. \nHe just needs to understand, he can be there for his stepbrother but it might be at the risk of missing the birth and not being there for you. A week is just too long at this stage of your pregnancy. That could and probably would hurt your relationship tbh, birth can be traumatic and you need someone to advocate for you. If he goes I would suggest having someone stay with you and prep them on your wishes just in case.", "NTA. seems like Reddit is all for fathers to be involved until the father in question has to actually sacrifice anything. Pregnancy is dangerous.

It's not worth the risk.", "NTA: That's just too close to your due date. He CAN call and video call to be with his step brother.

If this is your first child, I can 100% understand your anxiety about this. \n\nThat said, if you force him to miss the funeral and you don\u2019t have the baby early than he will most likely resent you and you know you will ruin your relationship with his brother going forward. \n\nCheck in with your OB, ask their opinion on your labor.  Mine were pretty adamant that my babies were going nowhere at the 36 week mark, but all bodies are different.\n\n***edited to add, he is a little bit T A H because he should only be going for 2-3 days TOPS at this point in your pregnancy.

And you check with the airline and various flights scheduled during those days to have a plan for him to get back as quickly as possible on the off chance something does happen during his trip.", "Ohh a terrible situation....\n\nAt one end you are at a very late stage of pregnancy and at the other end your husband has an important family engagement which she cannot get out off!!!\n\nYes it is important to remember that losing loved ones or close family member is also a very important occasion....\n\n\nHowever if possible ...can you call your mother or another family member who will help you out during this time... \n\nIf not then there may be a stage when you will have to talk to your husband and say that you need him now...\n\n\nHence NAH !!", "ESH. His brother just lost his SO ofc he has to support him.

His step brother's fiancee died, of course he would want to see him in person, pay his respects and support him, but I do agree a week is too long. You both need to compromise. You're having a baby and need to put your own wants aside and find a way to work together.  \n\nPersonally, a zoom call when there's nothing stopping him from going in person (your pregnancy is not high risk) is an insult. SB lost the love of his life, the person he thought he was going to grow old with, I can't imagine the level of pain he's in. A zoom call would not provide the level of comfort being there in person would, nor would it convey, 'I care about you'. What a zoom call does is convey, 'you're in my thoughts'. It's what you expect from a family member you're not close with and they can't be asked to make the journey.", "NTA, I'm sorry but your new unborn child comes before your stepbrothers fianc\u00e9s funeral everyone saying YTA is TA", "It's impossible to judge without knowing about all the relationships involved.  Was husband close to fiancee?  Do other people need husband's support?  Does husband really need to stay a whole week?  I can't tell, it just seems like something y'all have to discuss.", "NTA and I am shocked and disgusted by these comments. Giving birth is a major medical event no matter how well things go, and it can easily be a life or death situation if there are complications.\n\nThere are so many aspects that people are trivializing that I don't even know where to start. \n\nYour husband needs to start asking some really hard questions like, what happens if he misses the birth? Can you ever forgive him (and can he ever forgive himself?) what if you or the baby die in labor and he misses that? What if there is a medical emergency where you need someone to advocate for you? Why is it okay to leave his pregnant vulnerable wife to give birth alone when he wanted and planned for this child? \n\nI feel deeply for your husband and his step-brother. What happened is horrible and it is completely understandable why he wants to be there. But you could go into labor any second and that means he needs to be with you.", "He can go to the funeral but not stay for so long considering you are so far along.

The world doesn\u2019t stop for the last month of pregnancy, I went camping when I was about as far along as you are! However, a full week + is not reasonable when he has a heavily pregnant wife at home. As much as he wants to paint it as \u201csupport\u201c, in reality it\u2019s a vacation- one that might even eat away at his leave time that he should be taking when the baby is born.

Both are important and being caught between them at the same time creates a difficult situation. You both need to sit down and talk and find a reasonable compromise that meets both of your needs. And, no, a video call in lieu of being present at the funeral is not reasonable, but neither is staying there for a week. Unfortunately, you\u2019re both being unsupportive of each other and the only thing that\u2019ll fix it is open, honest communication and collaboration.", "NTA. What's there to support him for? Nothing happened to him. His stepbrother needs support and obviously you put your pregnant self above him and rightfully expect your husband to, as well. And one whole week? Not even a quick day trip?", "If he was close to her, I understand being adamant about doing, and also to support his stepbrother, but I had my baby 5 weeks early and I feel like that takes precedence. I feel like NAH, since I can see both sides. Maybe a compromise? He can go, but only for the funeral, and changeable tickets just in case?", "NAH. I think others have stated well that the extra time he wants to spend there is too much, but saying he can\u2019t go at all is also unreasonable. I agree with the person who said to check how your cervix is doing, and to make sure you have someone on hand in case labour starts. \n\nI had extremely short labour with my kids but there is a lead up to that\u2026 husband can grab a plane home if it happens the day after the funeral.

It is absolutely understandable that you want him to be close by and he is risking missing the birth if he goes.  The last 2-4 weeks of pregnancy are difficult, uncomfortable and worrying (I\u2019ve had 4 younglings), and with the first, there is added anxiety too.\n\nOne of the few acceptable reasons, imo, to leave a \u2018due any day\u2019 woman is a funeral.

Going sooner rather than later might be an idea, ie, a few days before the funeral and not staying for long after.  Could SBIL come and stay closer to you, find a hotel or AirBNB type place, so your brother can support him but also be with you?", "Wow. He should go to the funeral but to stay a week after when you\u2019re so close to the due date? Hell no! NAH.", "NTA. I would say N A H but the fact that he even wants to go away for two weeks is crazy. My SO didn\u2019t even want to go into work in person after about 36 weeks. \n\nI think there\u2019s two things that people might not understand: \n- the fact that you could give birth ANY TIME at this point, or have complications \n- the absolute dread and fear that mothers, especially first time mothers, have. Imagine you were told that, for the next five weeks, you have a constant and significant chance of being hit by a car. The health risk is off in this analogy, but maybe this helps illustrate the fear. That\u2019s why you NEED the person you most love with you, not a neighbor or a friend or anyone else.", "NTA.

That\u2019s pretty standard for a funeral trip. I understand why you\u2019re concerned though totally legitimate", "ESH. Your pregnancy isn\u2019t high-risk so it\u2019s not unreasonable for your husband to travel for a funeral with a month left until the baby is due. He cannot support his brother through video calls as well as in person. However, I think he should keep his trip to 3-4 days instead of a whole week. A week is excessive when he has an anxious pregnant wife at home.", "Maybe you should have put it on your main so he could comment from his perspective.", "Gentle YTA. Husband does not need to stay a full week for the funeral. Few days at most. To be fair, he escapes negative judgement because he is clearly concerned about his brother. However, you minimised the grief involved by stating a zoom call would be acceptable. That is ridiculous and honestly selfish on your part. I get you are anxious, but your pregnancy is not high risk and this is clearly an extenuating circumstance. \n\nThe one thing I\u2019m picking up on here is that you genuinely don\u2019t seem to care that the fianc\u00e9 of your BIL just died. I get you have other things going on, but some sympathy/empathy wouldn\u2019t go amiss here. Your husband is most likely picking up on this. It makes you comes across as selfish and demanding as opposed to genuinely concerned about your child. \n\nSit down with husband, express your empathy over the situation and come to a compromise about amount of days. If you prevent him from going, he will resent you. Understandably so.", "Do you have anyone else- family or friends- around to help you if needed?", "Yea YTA. Maybe a week is long but the man\u2019s brother just life his fianc\u00e9 and you suggest a video call ?\n\nEdit: NTA. Math has proved me wrong.", "YTA Yes, I see where you might be worried about the timing but it's pretty easily fixed by having changeable tickets. Put yourself in their shoes. The first week after a death is usually a haze. You're not really accepting it, you have lots of unfamiliar things to do, lots of people calling and visiting. That second week is when it starts to get \\*real\\* and, unfortunately, that's when many people start pulling back. Video calls are not the same.", "A hesitant and very soft YTA from me on this one. I can appreciate wanting to have your husband close on the off-chance of something happening, but something HAS happened to his stepbrother in the losing of his fianc\u00e9e so maybe your husband feels honor-bound to address an actual situation rather than being on standby for a hypothetical. It's a bit of a \"damned if you do, damned if you don't\" situation, because if he stays with you and everything you is fine I imagine he will feel guilty for not being there for his brother. Likewise I can imagine if he goes to the funeral and something happens where you need him by your side but he can't be there because he's with his brother, he would feel rubbish.\n\nDo you have other family who could support you if something did happen or would you be completely alone if he went to the funeral?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

These are both important and time-sensitive priorities, and it's hard to navigate big priorities when they clash.\n\nThis is the time for the two of you to work together to find a solution. My suggestion would be let him go but only for a few days, and in the meantime have contingency plans worked out *before* he goes. Make sure you have someone around who can help you if you need it, and look into what it would take to get him an emergency flight home. He needs to make sure he's always by his (charged!) phone while he's gone, and you should have scheduled check-in times with him so he knows what's going on with you, but try not to contact him outside of those times so he can focus on supporting his step-brother when he needs to.", "INFO: Does husband understand that at this point the baby could come at any time?

So uncool. \"Not supportive\" my ass.\n\nPerhaps step brother can come back and stay with you for a week if he needs emotional support in the wake of this tragic loss.

I know the death is terrible and his brother needs support but there\u2019s a reason we cleave from our families and go with our spouses.", "Agreed.38 weeks is a full term baby. Its tough because obviously his step brother will be hurting, but he is very much risking missing the brith of his baby and leaving his wife unsuported. Its not unreasonable to concider his options but also not unreasonable for her not to want him gone. If he really needs to support his step brother and there are no signs of labour (not that there always are) then a few days could be a calculated risk, but a whole week is way too long IMO.\n\nEdit to add: NTA", "Yeah, my husband used to travel for work a lot, including when I was pregnant. At the 36 week mark he had a blackout on his work calendar for travel (which he put on for three months - one month before birth and two months after).

Her husband was away for a business trip and was lucky he was already on his way home when the ambulance came.

Google may not be the best place to get answers, but apparently, pregnancies can last from 37 to 42 weeks and sometimes longer. I feel for the guy, but I think he should stay and video chat for the funeral. What happens if she gives birth while he's at the funeral? He's just gonna feel crummy for either leaving the funeral early and/or missing the birth of his child, which could have been avoidable it may turn into a no-win situation for him if he goes.", "Yeah they really can show up right on that mark. I went into labor the day I was 37 weeks and my son was born 15 hrs after my first contraction (typically it's more like 36-48, especially for a first baby because average is 24-48 hrs of early labor followed by several hours of active labor).", "Also, you never know with labor! One of my friends had her first baby, and it took her 28 hours of labor. Another friend had her first, and she was only in labor for 4 hours.", "Honestly, at 36 weeks she could go into labour at any time now.  It becomes more likely with every passing day at this point.  This late in the game anything can happen.  Dad being so far away that he has to take a flight back is running dangerously close to missing the birth of his child.

But I would caution against going at all.", "NTA. Our daughter was 4 weeks early, first time mom. Do you have family or good friends close by?

There is a middle ground to be found. As monumental as a birth is, the world doesn't stop for that. I'd hope his brother would understand why he can't stay for a week while you are as far along as you are as well. Is he exploring these options or is he just plowing through with the same plan?", "It\u2019s not about other people helping. It\u2019s their first child and what if something happens!", "I have the same question! If you are totally on your own then it makes sense that you wouldn\u2019t want him gone at all, but keep in mind you want might him to leave even less after the baby is born, so maybe now is a better time for him to leave for 2-3 days if you have a support system around you. He deserves to be able to support his family members. But you also deserve to feel safe and supported. Hopefully you can find a compromise!", "Or worse, if she has complications and he isn't there to help her through that, and make medical decisions for her if necessary.", "It's pretty easy to move up your return flight if needed. My wife went into labor several weeks early while I was on the other side of the country for work.

The funeral is next week and then the partner wants to stay for another week. So OP will be 37-38 weeks pregnant during this period. That is a very likely time period to go into labour and the partner will be a flight away. It just seems like they should be a lot more concerned about supporting their pregnant partner than they are.", "This would be my compromise as well.  Go to the funeral but plan to return the next day.  I would then try to schedule some time with my step brother after the baby is born.  It's not as impactful time wise but at least everyone feels supported.  I would also as the husband, try to aid in ways that didn't require me to be there like food delivery, helping with post funeral arrangements etc.", "There is no good option here, someone is going to have to bend and I\u2019ll be damned if I say who it should be.  Both are pretty significant events", "It isn't just him missing the birth or being a breathing coach, it's him not being able to support his wife during and after a major medical event. Partners are basically considered part of the medical team for births. My husband had to provide so much physical support to me after both births. And all of that is just in regards to the physical things. The emotional things are also worth considering. And all of that is assuming everything goes 100% according to plan. Which is not guaranteed, and depending on a variety of factors, not necessarily likely - Black and Latinx people are far more likely to have unplanned c-sections and the maternal mortality rate for Black people is TWICE what it is for white people. \n\nAnd what if something happened to the baby, which can happen even during a healthy pregnancy, and then he never got to meet his baby. Which would be horrible for his wife and him. \n\nThe risks do not outweigh the rewards.

OP, do you have family or friends nearby who could help you while your husband attends the funeral? Instead of his staying for a week after the funeral, which I think is unreasonable, your husband can support his step-brother via video chat or phone calls. I imagine that his step-brother would feel awful if your husband missed the birth of his child; I\u2019m sure your husband would agree that his stepbrother has enough to cope with right now and doesn\u2019t need to feel guilty on top of that.", "Yeah this part. His sibling will understand his situation especially having lost their own partner.\n\nCan he join the funeral via zoom even?", "Seconding this as well.

I know after both my brothers passed away when my other siblings and I spent a week with each of their widows at the 6 month and 1 year anniversary it ment a lot to them.", "My gut is telling me there is more to the story than being there for the step-brother for a week, especially with how mad he has gotten about it.   Does the step brother not have any other family in that area?  There is no reason why husband couldn\u2019t fly in the day before the funeral and fly home right after.", "Are you being for real right now?", "I\u2019ve had siblings and friends go into labor at 35/36 weeks. 37/38 weeks is that much more plausible.

I\u2019m not risking it, and neither should he. NAH", "I don't want to argue with you, but everyone's birth is different. From my very first sign that I might be in labor, to when I gave birth was 6 hours (for my first, my second was only like 2 hours).

I do wonder how far away the funeral is too.", "that's what I was thinking. Go now support his stepbrother then come back the day after the funeral.", "It's not just an early arrival, right in the time frame OPs partner would be away we found my baby was breech and I had unexpected extra appointments which included painful attempts to turn her and then a planned C section booked in before my due date. It's not realistic to expect the last month of pregnancy to exclude any time apart, and I can understand partner not wanting to miss the funeral and support their sibling but a week away is taking the proverbial.", "What happens if there's an emergency situation and she needs advocate of her and the baby. Childbirth isn't risk free even if it's been healthy so far. I don't get why OP's partner doesn't seem to care about her or the baby.", "That could happen.  It's much less likely to happen while he's gone than if he stays another week *after* the funeral.  \n\nI don't think he should go at all.  It's not just the possibility that she'll go into labor and give birth while he's gone.  Lots of things can go wrong during the last few weeks of pregnancy.", "It\u2019s actually +/- 2weeks. She can literally pop while he is at the funeral. Husband is an asshole for not putting his wife and baby first. Maternal mortality rate in the states puts it in 3rd world territory also.", ">but staying for a week and calling his wife unsupportive for not agreeing to it\n\nYeah the extra week is the real issue. If he were to just go for like...a day or two, it'd be less of a risky move. And honestly, even then only I'd only say it was ok if she had a close friend or family member who could stay with her during the time he's gone in case she does go into labor.", "It's honestly not even that crazy to go into labor at 36 weeks. I know plenty of women who have, or needed to be induced between 36/37 due to various reasons (pre-e, low amniotic fluid, etc). \n\nIn general most doctors will tell you past 35 weeks you and your support partner(s) should be sticking super close to home.", "All three of mine were between 37 and 38 weeks! It is absolutely not ok for the husband to be more than a two hour car ride away at this stage of her pregnancy.", "They don\u2019t know, only see movie perfect pregnancies where mom pops at 40 weeks on the dot and it\u2019s easy as pie. Not the trauma dump it can be in reality.", "Me either. My daughters were determined to come early. I can understand OP wanting her husband to be there when she delivers. NTA", "I\u2019ve known many people go into labor at 36-37 weeks. Also according to google 26% of pregnancies go into labor between 36-38 weeks.", "I had to be induced at 37 weeks for high blood pressure.", "My second I was 1 day short of 38 weeks and she was out 6 hours after my first contraction. It was super fast and super scary. I would have had her on my floor had I not had my husband with me", "That's the thing that's getting me the most, and don't get me wrong DEATH SUCKS, but, even assuming hubby & step-bro are super close--he's potentially missing the birth of his child to?? stay a week?? why? Is there no one else to comfort step bro for a week? surely step bro & hubby could understand the need for only a super short visit at most for the funeral at this point?", "this happened to my friend at 35+6. \n\nalso when I was 34 weeks my husband had to travel for work and was not allowed to have his personal phone with him. he got me set up with the Red Cross (he\u2019s military) so that I could get communication to him if something were to happen because realistically at that point something could\u2019ve. I ended up delivering at 37+1.\n\nI\u2019d understand for the funeral definitely he should go but staying extra is absolutely inappropriate in my opinion.", "Nobody say it\u2019s an easy choice. But we are talking about HIS child and HIS wife. Labour goes easily majority of the time, but can also go very wrong. Also in those \u2018east\u2019 time it\u2019s sure not a walk on the park. Having moral support but also someone that can make medical decision with and for you is vital.", "Yep, and 37 weeks is absolutely full-term. I am super tall, over 6 feet and normal weight around 160. The minute I hit 200 pounds I went into labor both times. I will not forget to look on my husband\u2019s face when I told him I officially weighed more than him at the time.", "Yeah, honestly at 36 weeks unless it's absolutely unavoidable, husband should just stay at home with preg wife", "Raises hand. That's what happened to me - I was already being monitored for higher blood pressure but routine visit three days past \"safe to give birth\" and I was in the hospital being induced. OP is at or just past where I was when I had my kid.\n\nI think if he can keep it down to 2 days he should go, but not an entire week.", "Yup 35 weeks I went to an appointment thinking all was good and a day later I'd been induced and had a baby", "That\u2019s what happened to me", "Yep. Had my visit 5 days before I gave birth to my son at 34 weeks due to a placental abruption. No indication that this would happen. I started bleeding and had to rush to the hospital for an emergency C-section. Can\u2019t imagine having done that without my husband there.", "She\u2019s not going, only he is. She said flying is a no for her.", "It would be much different if the roles were reversed, because the husband wouldn't be 36 weeks pregnant. So you're comparison doesn't really work here. I do feel like a compromise can be made though. Regardless, I don't think either parties are unreasonable, so NAH.", "There's two judgement acronyms, so a mod will be flagged if it winds up as the top comment. Not ideal as it makes more work for them, but it won't make the bot choose the wrong judgement.", "The bot only counts the top voted comment and if there are two judgements it is flaired by a human, so no worries either way.", "No it won't. There's more than one judgement acronym, so if it ends up as the top comment, the bot will go flag a moderator to come and work out what the commenter meant. It's not ideal, because it makes more work for the mods, but it won't cause a misjudgement.", "If my partner died and my sibling was about to have a baby, the baby takes priority.", "The desire to stay the extra week is what gives me that impression. Maybe he simply doesn\u2019t understand all the risks and uncertainty of pregnancy at this stage. I\u2019ll allow for that. But when she absolutely could go into labor at any point from now or the time he leaves, but is prioritizing step brother, feels like a lopsided support. I think it\u2019s okay if he goes for a few days and they discuss who can be a backup support. But it seems he\u2019s telling her to deal with it and she has to figure it out on her own. That\u2019s not being a supportive partner and father.", "Thank you I\u2019ll edit", "I understand that anxiety, which is why I say that it can't be a long trip, and there's a big difference between flying from Las Vegas to Utah vs Sydney Australia, you know? But if OP has a good support system and her husband can get back quickly, a funeral is important enough to consider options.", "Or even worse...a complication becomes a tragedy. Death from child birth is still a huge problem.", "Because you were lucky. It often doesn\u2019t play out like that due to many factors outside of people\u2019s control.", "But him going for a day, 2 days max is the best posible solution for an imposible situation, if it was his blood brother rather than his step brother, everyone will be calling her an AH. 2 days max is good enough IF and only if she has someone who can be there for her in that time window, if there's no other family or friends that can be on high alert, then by all means I don't think he should go.", "People jump to the strangest conclusions in here.", "Cool, I'm deft. Maybe google what the word means.", "Damn, y\u2019all people cold asf", "I think this person is talking about how the husband called her unsupportive of him.", "Yeah I gave birth at 37 weeks, by my math he'll be there through 38 or 39.", "I think this is the most reasonable answer so far. It is up to both of you to do the best you can to accommodate both you needs.  A FaceTime call is not an acceptable solution, but an entire week isn\u2019t great either. Make a plan to get him there with a way to get him back sooner, then get a checkup to see where you are and adjust accordingly.", "Me too! 37 weeks, 36 weeks and 32! None of them were interested in waiting until it was convenient and I wasn't high risk for my first 2 either.", "It is when you make a situation about your needs without even expressing some empathy for what the other party is experiencing. That\u2019s what makes it selfish. Generally speaking, it would not be selfish to want him home and even if it was, understandably so during late stage pregnancy. However my point is that she is only considering herself in this situation not the grief of her husband or his brother, or even the late fianc\u00e9.", "Nope. As previously noted. I was wrong.", "Yea math failed me. I hereby retract my YTA", "Seriously. I had severe preeclampsia sudden onset with our second baby. The time from symptoms starting (severe headache, abdominal pain) to emergency c-section was less than 2 hours. And that includes getting our neighbor to watch our oldest, getting to the hospital, and them setting up the OR.", "I am aware that\u2019s possible; hence the ESH and make an emergency plan about him getting back and only going for a few days. This isn\u2019t a I just want to go visit my family just because. This is a member of the family DIED.", "Then they will still have a baby.  What if she has the baby suddenly while he is at work, or while she is at work?  Life has calculated risks and trade offs.  We do the best we can.  This is a tragic event.  If she has other people to support her, let them lean in and provide that to her so he can support his brother.  I do agree a week is excessive and his time away should be shortened.", "Oh no. She gives birth. Like trillions of people before her. You're talking hypotheticals where as someone actually died and she wants him to phone it in.", "Oh, that does change things.", "I think that's a really great INFO to ask op.  Is he looking to leave you ALONE, or is the intent for you to have a trusted friend or family member come stay with you while he is away?", "The... medical professionals??", "Spill out more of his family \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I'm dying.\n\nBut yes I agree with you.", "LOL this is one weird way of saying she's about to have her baby", "It\u2019s also really important to have her husband there as an advocate.  You can\u2019t effectively advocate for yourself in hospital when you\u2019re in a labor, and you need that support person.  To say nothing if she were to god forbid need an emergency c-section or similar.", "I showed up for my weekly appointment at 38.5 weeks and was preeclamptic. They immediately admitted me to start magnesium and constant monitoring that afternoon and began the induction process the next morning.

Baby does not have a calendar in there.", "Thats why I said that she should ask him to go to the funeral and come back the next day", "[removed]", "Yes, 1-2 days would put this very much in NAH territory. It\u2019s the week stay while OP is 38 weeks pregnant and the husband\u2019s apparent unwillingness to see OP\u2019s concerns as valid that make this NTA for me.", "Yeah, once you get to 36 weeks you can easily for in for a check up and find out you need to deliver that day because of some health issue with mom or baby", "Pops at 40 weeks on the dot with a three month old baby with chubby cheeks and big eyes and giggles, as opposed to the wrinkly alien with monkey paws and an ancient sounding wail.", "All my friends either had to get induced or scheduled C so I had no fucking idea and didn\u2019t believe I was actually in labor with my first. I thought there was no way, it\u2019s way too early, it\u2019s just food poisoning. If I had waited 2 hours more I wouldn\u2019t have made it in time. There\u2019s no way in hell I was letting my husband be more than an hour away from our hospital that last month of pregnancy. Especially knowing how serious childbirth can be, it\u2019s not all rainbows and unicorns.", "And healthy pregnancies can turn quickly too! I was medically healthy at 36 weeks. At 38 weeks the preeclampsia showed. By 40 weeks i was at my doctor and things went downhill fast.

Yeah, it's definitely a no-win situation for him if he goes then.", "Exactly! Like my pregnancy was perfectly normal and I still delivered at 37 weeks and one day. That's not even considering the pregnancies that are not perfectly normal. The doctors would not let my aunt go past 36 weeks because she had mono amniotic twins. So they were prepared for them at 24 weeks and had her on bed rest from then until 36 weeks when they delivered with a scheduled C-section because it was as far as they would let her go.
