He's been mostly fed with formula as my BIL's wife was unable to breastfeed due to health issues. My wife has always been criticizing them for \"giving up on natural milk\" and depriving their baby from the benefits of it by going with formula. They've had countless arguments about it and my wife and MIL still think they're in the right.\n\n\nThe real problem was when I discovered that my wife's been breastfeeding their son (her nephew) whenever they drop him over before they go to dr appointments or run tests. My wife and I have a 10 months old son but I didn't know she's been secretly breastfeeding her nephew til I walked in on her doing it.\n\n\nI confronted her on it and she said she was trying to give back to her nephew all the benefits his parents took away from him after thry replaced breastfeeding with formula. I told her this was violating and that I would tell them immediately. She got mad and said I wouldn't dare. Matter of fact, she said that she's doing them a favor by feeding their son and trying to regain his strength and prevent future health issues due to lack of mother's milk. We yelled at each other and I told her again that I would tell them. She started begging me saying she's just trying to help and that she has her nephew's best interest st heart. She said if I tell them they won't ever let her see him so there's a lot at stake here.\n\n\nETA: Her brother and his wife had already brought formula for my wife to use so the whole excuse about the baby not getting fed is unreasonable.", "created_utc": 1667560771, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylw94s/aita_for_wanting_to_tell_my_bil_and_his_wife_that/", "score": 1690, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she has no communicable diseases then I doubt anything can be done with criminal law. The whole situation opens her up to having to expose her medical record to your family.

If she does this to a child that is severely allergic to milk she will kill them because she is in clear need of help and is convinced children are sick if they are not feed what she is doing to your nephew.

I went through consultants, mom groups... month after month of not focusing on *enjoying motherhood* because I'd been conditioned to believe I was a failure for this. Now I completely understand people who choose not to in the first place; it can make you feel like your sole purpose in life is producing milk, and for some that can keep them from actually, you know, being present with their child. Bonding is important for the health of mom and baby, and it doesn't *have* to come through feeding. Your wife is super judgmental, exposing another person's child to potential disease, and possibly interfering with the baby's actual feeding schedule and confusing his little system.

As long as they're fed that's all that matters. I know formula has less health benefits, but having a miserable stressed out parent is probably worse than a less antibody heavy food.\nAs for her bf her nephew ... has she asked the parents if its OK? They may not mind. Just because sil isn't bf doesn't mean she'll be against it. When I was bf formula seemed like so much extra effort, and if the baby crying makes her lactate or she's over producing then why not. Wet nurses were common for centuries. It's how baby's are made to be fed. But only if all parties are OK with it. Maybe as a compromise she could express some for nephew to have in a bottle.\nAs for the comment I saw regarding it being sexual harassment.... seriously? It's a baby being fed. Just because you think books are sexy doesn't make it in any way sexual. It's a meal.

No. Again, before anyone comes at me, i am a huge advocate for BF, but i would NEVER make someone else feel bad for not being able to or choosing not to.

They've had countless arguments about it and my wife and MIL still think they're in the right.\"\n\nTell your wife (and MIL) to STFU and stop mom shaming. We get that enough.\n1. Not everyone can breastfeed (this is more common than people know, thus why we even developed formula.) Formulas have been specifically designed to meet all the nutritional requirements that would be provided by breastmilk.\n2. They have been shaming a woman who is already experiencing increased levels of stress, possibly post partum depression, and may be feeling like a failure for being unable to provide the \"expected\" motherly requirements.i know this from personal experience.

But that is a big \"if\" that the BIL/SIL have the authority to dictate 100%.  \n\nMaybe a teeny tiny Y T A / E S H for OP getting into a yelling match with his wife rather than approaching this with a little more tenderness -- sometimes I can't understand how people get themselves into marriages with people they seem to have so little sympathy for.

Her first reaction to you saying that you would tell her brother was \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d She only started pleading when she realized that strategy wouldn\u2019t work.", "I cannot stress enough, FED is best!!  Be it breast or Formula!!!\nNow, if your wife had asked them and they agreed, or if he had run out of formula , then I Isee no problem\u2026. But because she hasn\u2019t asked..HUGE problem ,  the fact she is sneaking around and doing this,  ick!\nOp NtA, your wife on the other hand\u2026.", "NTA but you need to tell his parents before she makes this baby sick or worse. She could 100% put the child\u2019s life in danger doing this wtf is wrong with people? How could anyone think this is okay? You need to evaluate your life choices and partners and pray to god your BIL and SIL don\u2019t sue you", "NTA. Tell them ASAP", "NTA.\n\nShe knows what she is doing is wrong, otherwise she wouldn't be hiding it and wouldn't have freaked out when you found out.\n\nTell your BIL immediately. Huge violation of trust is happening here.\n\nYou also need to have a very hard talk with your wife about this. She seems to think that her opinion is the only one that matters and that will lead to more issues between the two of you in the future. Say you don't want your child to participate in a contact sport when they are a teen and your wife goes behind your back anyway because \"she knows better\".\n\nNot ok. And she needs to be called out on her abhorrent behaviour.", "NTA. Your wife could potentially have health issues she can transmit through the milk to the baby. She would be LUCKY if they only forbid her from spending time with the baby. She needs to be in therapy, because this is not normal.", "NTA- this is not acceptable. Formula is a perfectly sound way to feed a baby. And your wife is in the wrong here. If this happened with my son and my sister in law (we had babies close in age too), I would have felt equal parts anger, violated, and shamed. None of that is okay. Your wife needs therapy.", "She knows what she\u2019s doing is wrong because otherwise she would have asked or told them she was doing this. Personally I would be angry if my family member was breastfeeding my son without my permission, what if the baby had an allergy? My sisters daughter could only have soy formula, even her own mothers milk was making her sick. Your wife would probably breastfeed if she could but that does not give your wife the right to breastfeed the baby. Also breastfeeding is a deeply bonding action your wife and the baby might be become closer than just nephew and aunt, the LEAST she could do is pump her own milk and still use a bottle but she\u2019s not, she knows this is wrong otherwise why hide it?", "NTA\u2026 you need to tell your BIL/SIL what she is doing immediately. It is a violation of epic proportions, and yes\u2026 they may not allow her around their child for a while(if not forever), but that\u2019s their prerogative and right as parents. \n\nYour wife is under the impression that she\u2019s a \u201cbetter mother\u201d than SIL and therefore thinks she can override that child\u2019s parents. Imagine someone regularly doing something to/with your child behind your back and you not knowing about it. She is also contributing to possible nipple confusion or nephew refusing formula from his actual mother. \n\nYour wife is an adult, and whatever BIL/SIL choose to do, will be the direct consequences of her own shitty actions/decisions.  Maybe also ask yourself why she seems to be trying to alienate your nephew from his actual parents by having this secret bonding/feeding.  This whole situation would be different if she had actual permission from your BIL/SIL. So either your wife is an evil villain who\u2019s trying to parent bond with your nephew.. or she\u2019s a narcissist and honestly what seems like a not so very nice person as well. It seems she didn\u2019t fall far from her maternal tree.\n\nEdited to add more", ">Matter of fact, she said that she's doing them a favor by feeding their son\n\nShe may actually believe this is true, but it is not her call to make.\n\nAnd if she can't be trusted to respect the parents wishes, and refuses to stop, then by all means she shouldn't be able to see the kid any more (at least unsupervised).\n\nYou are NTA for wanting to tell them, but you are getting there for waiting so long to do something and allowing this to continue in the meantime.", "NTA. What your wife is doing is a 1000% wrong. Some may even say assault. Its is without a doubt an abuse of trust and power. If this was mind child I would remove her access ans consult a lawyer.\n\nTell your BIL", "NTA.  Your wife and MIL are wrong for shaming the decisions your inlaws have made regarding their child, and your wife is way out of bounds.  You should never do something with a child behind their parents back unless the parents are in some way harming the child.  They aren't, it's their decision to make.", "Nta. Your wife is disgusting and your nephews parents need to know what has been going on. She has broken their trust in a fundamental way and she knows it or she wouldn\u2019t be begging you to keep the secret.", "NTA and this would seriously make me question my marriage decisions. Can't imagine being married to someone that batshit insane.", "NTA.  She should never do that without consent.", "She knows it\u2019s a complete violation that they wouldn\u2019t agree with but went ahead and did it anyways because she knows best?! \n\nThey\u2019re going to be disgusted but at least with the right person. You keep this quiet and they\u2019ll be disgusted with you both should they ever find out.", "NTA\n\nThis is super weird and a massive violation of trust and boundaries. Tell them.", "Yes!!! My SIL's youngest baby is severely allergic to a protein in dairy. When she breastfed she couldn't eat anything with milk or cheese because her baby would be violently ill. She supplemented with formula whenever she could. Their kid could have an allergy that would restrict mom's diet too much! You don't know and don't NEED to know why they're feeding formula.\n\nEvery time OP's wife brings this up, she is disrespecting those parents. Please know my mom, her brother, and her sister were not breastfed and were only formula fed, and when they were babies they was pet milk and karo syrup. None of them have allergies and my uncle is 6'7\". My dad and his sisters were only breastfed and all 3 of them have severe allergies and asthma. The whole \"breast is best\" is anecdotal at best, and FED IS BEST. PERIOD. Your wife needs to butt out of she wants any relationship at all with them. NTA.", "This\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46 first thing I thought was health concerns. \n\nAdditionally - Babies can develop allergies to foods that you are eating while you are breastfeeding. And then not knowing why your baby has vomiting or diarrhea is even more upsetting. \n\nLastly what a huge violation of trust for everyone involved. And a slap in the face for the mom who would love to breastfeed but can\u2019t. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nShe\u2019s the AH.", "Could they sue her for that, if the child gets it, they find out, and turns out the child could only get it from the OP's wife?", "Agreed, I said in an earlier comment my mom and her siblings were formula fed and back then formula was pet milk and karo syrup. They have no allergies and my uncle is 6'7\"! My dad's side of the family was only breastfed and all of them have severe allergies and asthma. The whole \"breast feeding prevents allergies\" is anecdotal at best. FED is best. Full stop.\n\nOP NTA but your wife sure is. This is not her business.", "lmao what", "If everything was above board there wouldn\u2019t be a problem. However, she never asked. The problem is that is that she is usurping the authority of the parents who know their child best. There are ways to get breast milk if she wanted it. She didn\u2019t.", "I think it\u2019s a violation of boundaries and trust and the parents should be told. That woman is so anti formula she\u2019s willing to secretly breastfeed someone\u2019s baby?! That\u2019s crazy. She\u2019s crazy. \n\nI\u2019m all, \u201cbreast is best!\u201d And I breastfed my children for like two years each. It was a fucking pain in the ass and I was really tempted to go to formula. The problem is so many woman shame others for using formula to the point that these women best themselves up over it. It\u2019s really hard to pump at work so if you have to return to work you\u2019re probably going to use formula. Babies do just fine on formula all the time.", "Is this his wife or something lol", "They haven\u2019t asked her to do it. The baby could also have sensitivities, hence the formula, that the Wife isn\u2019t taking into account. Is she dairy free? Soy free? This could be a risk to the baby, AND it\u2019s a violation of their trust to do this without their permission.", "Mom will obviously and rightfully object or else Ops wife wouldn\u2019t do it in secret?", "I wouldn't want to be in contact with someone who did this behind my back. The rift will be because the wife acted inappropriately and not because you told or the rest of the family became upset. This whole thing is icky, weird and upsetting and they have a right to know. What about other things where the wife \"thinks she's right?\" What might happen then?", "I don\u2019t think this is a good option. What OPs wife did was awful and it was a conscious choice she made, hid and repeated. If OP hides this and it somehow gets out later then he\u2019ll be in the firing zone too. Imagine if someone did something to your child then hid it from you, cause \u2018no harm no foul!\u2019 \n\nNo, the parents deserve to know, and OPs wife deserves the backlash. NTA for telling OP, but you will be if you cover for her. She\u2019s an adult who made a choice, she can deal with her consequences.", "Few things are as insufferable as mommy martyrs. This woman sounds like a real joy. I also couldn't breastfeed because of health issues and I swear these women's only real intention is to make themselves feel better than everyone by making other moms feel like shit.  They usually end up creating super insufferable kids as well.", "He needs to tell them, but there is much more to breast milk than colostrum. However, fed is best and the parents are the only ones who can make this decision.", "If OP keeps it quiet and expects her to stop, she\u2019d probably just try to hide it from OP better. She sounds like a zealot, and there\u2019s no way to verify that she\u2019s stopped.", "I'm not even a mother yet, but I am FURIOUS for this baby's mom. What a complete violation.", "Why must something be \u201cgained\u201d by exposing an obvious wrong doing?", "100% agree. Breastfeeding is wonderful when it works but fed is best.", "It's as simple as this. Should have just asked first.\n\nYour SIL might have even said yes, or agreed to taking some extra frozen milk to be fed via bottle.\n\nBe careful how you tell SIL - she is likely hurting her inside knowing she can't breastfeed. Hearing this might destroy her and your family as you know it.", "My first thought as well.", "Yes! Twin studies show that once you account for confounding factors (mothers educational status, family socioeconomic status, and access to clean water/safe formula) that there are no long term statistically significant differences. There are small short term differences but nothing to break trust over!", "Also what would this do to the bond a child has with their mom? It\u2019s like she\u2019s trying to take over the role of mother, which is unforgivable.", "Right, I'm worried for her baby too. Wife's clearly unwell.", "Sure, but the key to your statement is \"whenever they were around.\" In your instance, it is both culturally appropriate and the parents are *aware*. In this instance it is neither and even if it was culturally appropriate the parents being unaware makes it wrong.", "Yeah, sharing breastmilk is something people have traditionally done for a very long time. But it's supposed to be about sharing- not secretly doing it behind their backs. Lactivists can be really crazy, and OP's wife is off the deep end here.", "Not a sudden change, I would bet she has been doing this all along", "^ this ^\n\nExactly this OP. She\u2019s worried as she knows she is in the wrong but that\u2019s the risk she took. Your nephews parents have the right to know, especially if SIL couldn\u2019t BF due to medical reasons. This is going to explode, and none of it is your fault.\n\nYou need to tell the parents. NTA", "At 8 months old (10months since wife started breastfeeding) any additional benefits to BM vs formula are long gone. The benefits really only extend out to 6months max with most of them gone by 3months. There's essentially no difference between them at this point. So OPs wife's excuse is even weaker.", "Honestly, fed is best. Whatever it takes to have a happy, healthy kiddo and mom.", "It\u2019s not about the milk it\u2019s about consent and boundaries.", "She is not a wet nurse! And even then, wet nurses were appointed by those who could afford them to feed their children. They weren\u2019t just anyone who produces milk. And at this stage in his development, breast milk is not providing any benefits. If the parents had chosen the wife to nurse their child it would be a totally different situation. But they didn\u2019t. They chose to formula feed their child and the wife thinks she knows better than them, so she nurses the baby behind their backs. That is not the same as a wet nurse and you know it.", "Yes a wet nurse is someone a parent or parents INVITE and pay to breastfeed their child because they can't or simply don't want to but still want the marginal benefits of breast milk over formula. This is not that. This is also running the risk of the parents worrying that the child has health issues because he won't drink the formula they give him because he's full from the breast milk.  OPs wife is horrifically overstepping her bounds and there no pretending she's a wet nurse here.", "However, doing it without consent is <assault and battery of a child>\n\nFixed it for you", "There has been no consent obtained. Your opinion is disqualifying.", "What is your area of expertise?", "Agreed! The expression used to be \u201cbreast is best\u201d  it now they say \u201cFED is best\u201d. SIL couldn\u2019t breast feed, don\u2019t judge her for formula feeding her baby. Better fed than dead.", "THIS. \nThere is no real evidence to say that formula produces less healthy adults. It's pretty negligible the difference between formula fed and breast fed.\nThe toxicity of mothers thinking breast is the ONLY way babies get thier nutrition is absurd and downright harmful to everyone else. \nTbh i would personally find it odd another woman breastfeeding my child, my partner thinks it's fine but i don't think i would ever allow it. But that is my opinion.\nOP this is about consent and safety for your nephew. She needs to stop, and be accountable for her actions.", "there is nothing good or helpful about the thought behind doing this. this is a severe violation of boundaries, regardless of what your stance on breastfeeding is. absolutely disgusting behaviour", "There is a reason for the saying, \u201cThe road to hell is paved in good intentions.\u201d \n\nShe knows she is wrong otherwise she wouldn\u2019t be hiding what she is doing.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking! Like if not being allowed to see the nephew is the only repercussion she will be fortunate.", "I would absolutely press charges against anyone who breastfed my child without my knowledge and consent. Your wife is unhinged and needs therapy. YWBTA and an accomplice if you keep your mouth shut. I\u2019m so skeeved out.", "I don\u2019t even know if she means well, to be honest. If it was coming from a good place she would have asked the parents first. Her doing it behind their backs does not have \u201cgood intentions\u201d written on it.", "Absofuckinglutely they could. \n\nYou can sue a consensual partner for giving you a STD. \n\nThe baby\u2019s parents didn\u2019t consent to breastfeeding sessions\u2026 it was forced upon baby in secret. If OP\u2019s wife did pass something on, she would 100% be liable.", "A good point, she would need to stop babysitting before I'd brlieve she stopped BF the kid"]}
