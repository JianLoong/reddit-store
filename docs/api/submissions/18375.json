Like seriously tried to get to the bottom of why she feels she needs to be completely free of body hair at 13?\n\nI understand peer pressure, and keeping up with your friends can play a part but this post is raising some concerning red flags and you need to talk to your child.", "On the one hand, a place that does a full Brazilian for thirteen year olds should be shut down. \n\nOn the other hand you shouldn\u2019t lie to your kid.", "First of all... this stuff is not cheap so she should be participating in the cost of this if she is truly serious about it. Waxing is not permanent removal of hair so she better start saving.\n\nSecondly, she will need to find out on her own that it\u2019s not a fun time. Just start with one area at a time & see how it goes. Unless this has been an ongoing conversation or problem, it sounds like this is more about fitting in than actual concern about body hair. \n\nYou may want to let the salon know about your concerns & little white lie so they don\u2019t blow your cover. \n\nNAH", "Oh, boy, a tough one. Never, ever lie to your kid bcs once they figure it out you'll lose their trust. Your daughter is a young teenager, the worst possible age to lose her trust. Come clean, talk with her why you think She should wait and ask her why she's feeling \"miserable\". There must be something behind her reaction. You meant well, I just dont think this is the way.", "NTA for keeping her privates covered. But lying to her sucks.\n\n\nMaybe check with the salon to see what they say. Perhaps you're not lying about restrictions. I would hope that any reputable salon would refuse to do a Brazilian wax/anything involving genitals on anyone under 18. It just rings too close to child abuse.", "NAH but maybe she doesn\u2019t like how it feels down there and was concerned about that- I know I don\u2019t personally it\u2019s a sensory thing", "She should not be waxed at 13 THERE.  You were correct in that.  However,  honesty is the best policy.  Explain to her she is too young.  Give her other options.  Girls are cruel.  And I mean cruel.  Show her how to safely remove it herself.  How to safely upkeep herself.  Or she will find a way to do it by herself and it could end up hurting her.", "Slight YTA for the lying bit, but understandable that you are looking out for your child. If she's never had it done before, she doesn't really know what she's getting into. A boundary of \"we will start with this and build your tolerance up for more sensitive areas\" would be acceptable, and let them know it's not a hopeless no for years, but rather a stepping stone. Lies come out eventually and can hurt her trust in you. There's always the chance she laments she can't get the full thing done to the waxer and they inform her that it's not a rule, and then you've broken her trust about something she feels is important. If she feels she can't trust you over this, she may not come to you for other things in the future.\n\nIf she's legitimately upset crying over not getting it done though, you should REALLY have a good sit down judgement free conversation about why it's so distressing for her to have body hair. It could be self image, teasing, or sensory issues. Heck, I had a college friend who was experiencing gender dysphoria, and they found that full waxing helped them not feel disgusted about themselves. Sit down and listen. She might be going through something that you haven't realized.", "NTA\n\nWaxes are painful AF. And a full body wax??\nHell no!!!!\n\nIf she went with it, she would regret it\n\nShe's 13.

But you might want to check if she's being teased or bullied, or if she's worried that pubic hair will show when she's swimming. But the reality is, waxing is expensive and if you don't want to pay for that for her, that's ok. She can earn money for a ladyshave if she wants to.", "NTA.  But I'd do it differently.  \n\nTell her that it's very painful and she should see if she likes it first.  So why not start with the legs, and then if she is okay with it then next time she can do more?", "I feel like I've fallen into an insane alternative reality. Why are parents allowing their children to be waxed at all??? What planet do you guys live on? She's 13. Maybe give her one of those at home DIY kits to see if she can stand it. My god she doesn't need to be waxing her WHOLE body at 13. \n\nNTA for not letting her get the whole thing I guess but my god, I can't imagine how many issues she's gonna have as she grows older.", "YTA, you need to talk to her. That strong of a negative reaction indicates she's either trying to be hairless for someone (a boyfriend? a predator?) or that she's worried about hair keeping her from wearing swimsuits. I hope it's the second one and if so you still need to come up with a solution for that together.", "Have a conversation with her. Tell her it\u2019s ok to have preferences but she shouldn\u2019t feel pressured to do it. Ask if anyone said anything\n\nTell her that you felt worried when she was very upset about not getting her private parts waxed. Does her pube area extend past the underwear area? Explain the difference between a bikini wax and brazilian. Pretty sure with a brazilian even your butt crack hair gets waxed, ask her if she understands that, and if there is a reason she would like to remove that hair. NOBODY should be seeing the buttcrack of a 13 year old, even if she\u2019s in the locker room changing she should still have underwear on right? And even if she had to change underwear, pretty sure the butt kind of naturally covers the butt crack hair lol\n\nAnyway, pretty understandable if she wants a bikini wax if her pubic hair is outside the underwear zone. it hurt like a BITCH and will probably deter her from getting the full brazilian. i also recommend buying her a pubic hair trimmer that is a lot safer than shaving!", "NTA. She\u2019s way too young for that. And everyone saying \u201eit\u2019s her body so she should get to choose\u201c- so is getting a piercing or tattoo, and most parents won\u2019t let their 13 year old get one. Also, is it really her choice when she\u2019s been been inundated by messages on social media, porn and teenage boys who\u2019s only experience with women is porn that body hair on a woman is disgusting?\n\nOP, I do think you should have a talk with her about the whole thing. Because her extreme reaction to not getting a full body wax at 13 suggests that something else is going on. It\u2019s obviously not just about \u201eshaving is such a hassle\u201c", "YTA because lying to your teen is a great way to create distrust just as your relationship is getting more complicated, and for not talking with her honestly about why you aren\u2019t on board. Also YTA for not listening to her about why she wants to go full Monty.", "YTA for lying to her. Please talk to her about why she wants to do it - is it because of bullying? Does she just hate it personally? Is it a sensory issue? Could be so many things. \n\nI have hated having body hair for as long as it has existed on me. I have very light skin and very dark hair and my mom wouldn\u2019t let me shave till way too late. It was awful and I definitely got teased. I hated bathing suits because my hair was thick and coarse and even just doing the sides/thighs wasn\u2019t enough because there was like, an obvious lumpiness from pubic hair. I literally stole a razor from my mom\u2019s bathroom closet and shaved everything waist down. Somehow or another it came up and she didn\u2019t just tell me she thought it was weird to want to be hairless, but told her friends and tried to make me feel uncomfortable about it. I didn\u2019t care, it was how I wanted my body to look and feel. I was in middle school, so around your daughter\u2019s age. It wasn\u2019t for boys, it wasn\u2019t for a predator, I wasn\u2019t pressured by anyone else. I just wanted it for me and to feel good about myself. \n\nI got a full body wax (sans arms) for my wedding/honeymoon and it was the best decision, but ended up being too costly to maintain. I decided to splurge a few years back and got laser hair removal and it was so worth it.", "I\u2019d just let her get her arms waxed and let a razor do everything else. If she is a swimmer or in a bathing suit a lot then maybe the bikini line. However you do realize that you have to let hair grow out in order to wax it again right?", "Idk what the rules are where you guys live, but at the salons around me, you actually do have to be at least 16 with parents' permission. I know because I wanted one when I was 17 but ultimately changed my mind because I'm a chicken, and didn't want to pretend my old neighbor was my mom because I didn't want to ask my dad lol.\n\n NTA, if she's never even had a wax, this would not be a fun experience for her. Or the waxing lady who has to do this for a 13-year-old. I'd be uncomfortable if I was asked to do that for my job.", "YTA for lying and wanting to control how your daughter takes care of her body.

I have been a wax specialist for almost 8 years, it's an awesome and confidence building service. That being said, I do think 13 is a little young for a Brazilian wax, and a few of the studios I have worked in do actually require parental consent for under 16. \n\nSlight YTA for shaming her for this just because you don't mind having body hair.", "YTA. My pubic hair made me feel uncomfortable as hell when I was your daughter\u2019s age, especially during the summer.

At 13 she can decide her own grooming standards. You s.just need to discuss it. In addition. Dissuding who is paying for waxing might be prudent.

I started shaving at that age and it had zero to do with anyone sexualizing me or societal pressure - I simply did not like the feeling of body hair from a sensory perspective and it was my choice. If your daughter wants to remove her body hair you should support her in doing so and neutralize it, not sexualize it. If you think she is being influenced or has negative things in her life that you should be concerned about, address them but don\u2019t relate them to her body hair. Like if she\u2019s hanging out with an older guy or older girls and you think that\u2019s influencing her, address it, but don\u2019t make it a battle over body hair. Her negative view of her body hair could be a symptom of a problem, but not the problem itself. And at the end of the day it\u2019s still her choice, so if you don\u2019t want to pay for waxing teach her how to shave or use hair removal cream or epilators.", "Lmaooo sorry to break it to you but your daughter is fucking.

I don't have a problem with teens getting their legs waxed, of course. \n\nI agree that if this is something that her daughter really wants to do, she should talk to her about doing it at home. And of course, I hope she's shown her how to shave as well in case she doesn't end up liking waxing as much as she thinks. \n\nSorry to hear about your friend, that sounds horrible! I've definitely given myself some small cuts, scrapes, and razor burn when I was learning. I think that's part of the process of figuring it out though. A friend of mine on the other hand almost always cuts herself badly, she even cut out a piece of her ankle tattoo once lol. Nothing bad enough for the ER though. Maybe some people really shouldn't be shaving. But I think that's why it's best for her to discuss different options as well. Personally I've never been good with waxing, just can't get the hang of it. My friend who sucks at shaving is a pro though, to each their own.", "She booked an appointment to start slow. Maybe see how daughter does first without committing to a full body wax. The kid has no clue what waxing is like... give her a minute to be able to make a fully informed decision about whether or not she truly wants a full body wax. Based on daughter\u2019s reaction, she\u2019s either not mature enough to understand how to make good decisions (no one said no she couldn\u2019t do waxing) or there\u2019s another issue here that needs to be explored (body dysmorphia)\n\nWhat works for you is not applicable to this person\u2019s daughter.", "If you were paying for it then you didn\u2019t really need your parents approval or permission. If Mom is paying for it, then she gets a say. \n\nI have no issue with personal choices. I have 2 daughters (25 & 27), 1 started waxing in her teens & swears by it, the other one doesn\u2019t. \n\nWithout any other background information all we know is this happened after a conversation with her friend. My kids always needed a better reason to do or want something than \u201cso & so does it, has it, so I want it\u201d\n\neta \u2014 also if kids are not mature enough to get more information & schedule their own appointment then ... they may not be mature enough to make the decision. Daughter could have called salon herself & booked this. So Mom\u2019s lie is not a big deal for me.", "She is 13. Her mother can decide if she wants a stranger waxing her daughters bikini area or not. Mom is actually on the right track starting with smaller areas like legs, armpits, etc. Who the heck takes their 13 year old for a full body wax anyway!! That\u2019s coming up on weirdo territory.", "I mean by that token, it's also silly to act like not itching never happens either, right?", "See my original comment.", "A bikini wax is not what she asked for. She asked for it all off (aka, a Brazilian).", "Again though have that discussion with her daughter. Don\u2019t lie and say the salon won\u2019t allow it. Her daughter is stating that she\u2019s struggling with maintaining her body hair and wants to try something different. The OP\u2019s immediate response was it\u2019ll be painful you shouldn\u2019t do it and then lying about it versus approaching it as a let\u2019s start small and see how you feel. It\u2019s also not like the daughter was asking for laser hair removal. \n\nAlso it seems more likely if maintenance is the issue for her that she\u2019s struggling with something like PCOS than body dysmorphia", "At 13 I wasn\u2019t really allowed to schedule my own appointments that I\u2019d require a ride to *and* waxing under 18 generally requires a parental liability waiver signed once at least if it\u2019s a reputable place. The daughter also brought up that she was struggling to maintain her body hair and wanted to try waxing as an alternative.", "So what? She\u2019s 13 and likely doesn\u2019t understand all the options. She just wants to be hairless and I\u2019m surprised more people aren\u2019t empathetic to that desire given how unsettling puberty can be for young girls. All the more reason for OP to communicate better instead of saying no and lying. She will absolutely find a way to remove the hair with or without permission.", "[deleted]", "Honestly, I think OP made the right choice. She agreed to book an appointment for certain areas. She did not agree to a full body wax... yet. Based on daughter\u2019s reaction she\u2019s not ready for a full body wax. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t waste my time arguing with my daughters if they are not willing to be reasonable & compromise. I would have no problem blaming the salon.", "I\u2019m not unsympathetic. But giving a sexualized beauty treatment to a child is not the answer.", "OP agreed to allow her to have certain areas done. It\u2019s not an all or nothing situation. If daughter doesn\u2019t want to accept those terms, then she doesn\u2019t really want to have waxing. Hair removal is painful & daughter has no clue what she is talking about so let\u2019s start slow & work our way up. Totally reasonable. \n\nIt\u2019s not necessarily a lie. Most salons require parents consent for a full body wax. She\u2019s just not giving it until daughter is 16.", "A classic Brazilian is full removal of pubic hair. They CAN leave a small strip or patch and it still counts but a non modified Brazilian is all the hair", "Nah, a full wax is a full Brazilian. \n\nThe strip means a Brazilian with a landing strip. \n\nThink about that name and what that puts emphasis on.", "And that\u2019s your opinion. I stand by mine. The OP should have had a conversation with their daughter versus immediately being discouraging and lying about it leaving no room for discussion about a full body wax for 3 years. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the daughters reaction was from OP constantly pulling the parent card and not respecting their daughter", "Hair removal is a neutral activity. Its not any more sexualized than being a pubescent human.", "The only person making it sexual is you, lol.", "Stop sexualising hair removal, people who have periods often want hair fully removed for comfort reasons. You're assuming far too much.", "She needs to be honest that she isn\u2019t allowing her to do it. It won\u2019t take her long to learn the truth anyway given this is likely a conversation that all the girls are having.", "If OP\u2019s answer is I am willing to allow my daughter to try this but only these areas, then that\u2019s her answer. She knows her daughter, has her own an opinion & honestly doesn\u2019t need a reason beyond she feels a full body wax may not be appropriate for her daughter. Maybe they go & learn more & it works out great for everyone. \n\nHowever, if daughter cannot except Mom\u2019s terms, then I guess she doesn\u2019t really want waxing. It\u2019s not all or nothing situation.", "How old are you? \n\nAs an older millennial I can absolutely assure you that level of genital hair removal was not a thing prior to the internet and it\u2019s easy availability of hardcore pornography.", "Agreed - I was a total tom boy and not at all interested in relationships but I still shaved my legs, armpits and bikini line for swimming and dance", "I don\u2019t disagree that OP\u2019s daughter should be able to trim her pubic hair herself. It\u2019s entirely possible to get to a hygienic level with scissors as opposed to a Brazilian wax on a 13 year old.", "I\u2019m in my 30s and my mother was sugar waxing long before we were born. She taught me how to wax because we are light skinned with dark hair and I\u2019ve never known \u201cexcess\u201d body hair to be celebrated for girls. Kids are also relentlessly cruel about differences. That\u2019s a reality that I\u2019m glad my parents were honest about.", "Shaved your bikini line. \n\nYou did not have someone apply wax to your labia. That is 100000% unnecessary for a 13 year old.", "Scissors? That sounds unhygienic and unsafe"]}
