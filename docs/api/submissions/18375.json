Like seriously tried to get to the bottom of why she feels she needs to be completely free of body hair at 13?\n\nI understand peer pressure, and keeping up with your friends can play a part but this post is raising some concerning red flags and you need to talk to your child.", "On the one hand, a place that does a full Brazilian for thirteen year olds should be shut down. \n\nOn the other hand you shouldn\u2019t lie to your kid.", "First of all... this stuff is not cheap so she should be participating in the cost of this if she is truly serious about it. Waxing is not permanent removal of hair so she better start saving.\n\nSecondly, she will need to find out on her own that it\u2019s not a fun time. Just start with one area at a time & see how it goes. Unless this has been an ongoing conversation or problem, it sounds like this is more about fitting in than actual concern about body hair. \n\nYou may want to let the salon know about your concerns & little white lie so they don\u2019t blow your cover. \n\nNAH", "Oh, boy, a tough one. Never, ever lie to your kid bcs once they figure it out you'll lose their trust. Your daughter is a young teenager, the worst possible age to lose her trust. Come clean, talk with her why you think She should wait and ask her why she's feeling \"miserable\". There must be something behind her reaction. You meant well, I just dont think this is the way.", "NTA for keeping her privates covered. But lying to her sucks.\n\n\nMaybe check with the salon to see what they say. Perhaps you're not lying about restrictions. I would hope that any reputable salon would refuse to do a Brazilian wax/anything involving genitals on anyone under 18. It just rings too close to child abuse.", "NAH but maybe she doesn\u2019t like how it feels down there and was concerned about that- I know I don\u2019t personally it\u2019s a sensory thing", "She should not be waxed at 13 THERE.  You were correct in that.  However,  honesty is the best policy.  Explain to her she is too young.  Give her other options.  Girls are cruel.  And I mean cruel.  Show her how to safely remove it herself.  How to safely upkeep herself.  Or she will find a way to do it by herself and it could end up hurting her.", "Slight YTA for the lying bit, but understandable that you are looking out for your child. If she's never had it done before, she doesn't really know what she's getting into. A boundary of \"we will start with this and build your tolerance up for more sensitive areas\" would be acceptable, and let them know it's not a hopeless no for years, but rather a stepping stone. Lies come out eventually and can hurt her trust in you. There's always the chance she laments she can't get the full thing done to the waxer and they inform her that it's not a rule, and then you've broken her trust about something she feels is important. If she feels she can't trust you over this, she may not come to you for other things in the future.\n\nIf she's legitimately upset crying over not getting it done though, you should REALLY have a good sit down judgement free conversation about why it's so distressing for her to have body hair. It could be self image, teasing, or sensory issues. Heck, I had a college friend who was experiencing gender dysphoria, and they found that full waxing helped them not feel disgusted about themselves. Sit down and listen. She might be going through something that you haven't realized.", "NTA\n\nWaxes are painful AF. And a full body wax??\nHell no!!!!\n\nIf she went with it, she would regret it\n\nShe's 13.

But you might want to check if she's being teased or bullied, or if she's worried that pubic hair will show when she's swimming. But the reality is, waxing is expensive and if you don't want to pay for that for her, that's ok. She can earn money for a ladyshave if she wants to.", "NTA.  But I'd do it differently.  \n\nTell her that it's very painful and she should see if she likes it first.  So why not start with the legs, and then if she is okay with it then next time she can do more?", "I feel like I've fallen into an insane alternative reality. Why are parents allowing their children to be waxed at all??? What planet do you guys live on? She's 13. Maybe give her one of those at home DIY kits to see if she can stand it. My god she doesn't need to be waxing her WHOLE body at 13. \n\nNTA for not letting her get the whole thing I guess but my god, I can't imagine how many issues she's gonna have as she grows older.", "YTA, you need to talk to her. That strong of a negative reaction indicates she's either trying to be hairless for someone (a boyfriend? a predator?) or that she's worried about hair keeping her from wearing swimsuits. I hope it's the second one and if so you still need to come up with a solution for that together.", "Have a conversation with her. Tell her it\u2019s ok to have preferences but she shouldn\u2019t feel pressured to do it. Ask if anyone said anything\n\nTell her that you felt worried when she was very upset about not getting her private parts waxed. Does her pube area extend past the underwear area? Explain the difference between a bikini wax and brazilian. Pretty sure with a brazilian even your butt crack hair gets waxed, ask her if she understands that, and if there is a reason she would like to remove that hair. NOBODY should be seeing the buttcrack of a 13 year old, even if she\u2019s in the locker room changing she should still have underwear on right? And even if she had to change underwear, pretty sure the butt kind of naturally covers the butt crack hair lol\n\nAnyway, pretty understandable if she wants a bikini wax if her pubic hair is outside the underwear zone. it hurt like a BITCH and will probably deter her from getting the full brazilian. i also recommend buying her a pubic hair trimmer that is a lot safer than shaving!", "NTA. She\u2019s way too young for that. And everyone saying \u201eit\u2019s her body so she should get to choose\u201c- so is getting a piercing or tattoo, and most parents won\u2019t let their 13 year old get one. Also, is it really her choice when she\u2019s been been inundated by messages on social media, porn and teenage boys who\u2019s only experience with women is porn that body hair on a woman is disgusting?\n\nOP, I do think you should have a talk with her about the whole thing. Because her extreme reaction to not getting a full body wax at 13 suggests that something else is going on. It\u2019s obviously not just about \u201eshaving is such a hassle\u201c", "YTA because lying to your teen is a great way to create distrust just as your relationship is getting more complicated, and for not talking with her honestly about why you aren\u2019t on board. Also YTA for not listening to her about why she wants to go full Monty.", "YTA for lying to her. Please talk to her about why she wants to do it - is it because of bullying? Does she just hate it personally? Is it a sensory issue? Could be so many things. \n\nI have hated having body hair for as long as it has existed on me. I have very light skin and very dark hair and my mom wouldn\u2019t let me shave till way too late. It was awful and I definitely got teased. I hated bathing suits because my hair was thick and coarse and even just doing the sides/thighs wasn\u2019t enough because there was like, an obvious lumpiness from pubic hair. I literally stole a razor from my mom\u2019s bathroom closet and shaved everything waist down. Somehow or another it came up and she didn\u2019t just tell me she thought it was weird to want to be hairless, but told her friends and tried to make me feel uncomfortable about it. I didn\u2019t care, it was how I wanted my body to look and feel. I was in middle school, so around your daughter\u2019s age. It wasn\u2019t for boys, it wasn\u2019t for a predator, I wasn\u2019t pressured by anyone else. I just wanted it for me and to feel good about myself. \n\nI got a full body wax (sans arms) for my wedding/honeymoon and it was the best decision, but ended up being too costly to maintain. I decided to splurge a few years back and got laser hair removal and it was so worth it.", "I\u2019d just let her get her arms waxed and let a razor do everything else. If she is a swimmer or in a bathing suit a lot then maybe the bikini line. However you do realize that you have to let hair grow out in order to wax it again right?", "Idk what the rules are where you guys live, but at the salons around me, you actually do have to be at least 16 with parents' permission. I know because I wanted one when I was 17 but ultimately changed my mind because I'm a chicken, and didn't want to pretend my old neighbor was my mom because I didn't want to ask my dad lol.\n\n NTA, if she's never even had a wax, this would not be a fun experience for her. Or the waxing lady who has to do this for a 13-year-old. I'd be uncomfortable if I was asked to do that for my job.", "YTA for lying and wanting to control how your daughter takes care of her body.

I have been a wax specialist for almost 8 years, it's an awesome and confidence building service. That being said, I do think 13 is a little young for a Brazilian wax, and a few of the studios I have worked in do actually require parental consent for under 16. \n\nSlight YTA for shaming her for this just because you don't mind having body hair.", "YTA. My pubic hair made me feel uncomfortable as hell when I was your daughter\u2019s age, especially during the summer.

At 13 she can decide her own grooming standards. You s.just need to discuss it. In addition. Dissuding who is paying for waxing might be prudent.

I started shaving at that age and it had zero to do with anyone sexualizing me or societal pressure - I simply did not like the feeling of body hair from a sensory perspective and it was my choice. If your daughter wants to remove her body hair you should support her in doing so and neutralize it, not sexualize it. If you think she is being influenced or has negative things in her life that you should be concerned about, address them but don\u2019t relate them to her body hair. Like if she\u2019s hanging out with an older guy or older girls and you think that\u2019s influencing her, address it, but don\u2019t make it a battle over body hair. Her negative view of her body hair could be a symptom of a problem, but not the problem itself. And at the end of the day it\u2019s still her choice, so if you don\u2019t want to pay for waxing teach her how to shave or use hair removal cream or epilators.", "Lmaooo sorry to break it to you but your daughter is fucking.
