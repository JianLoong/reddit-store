Waxing is not permanent removal of hair so she better start saving.\n\nSecondly, she will need to find out on her own that it\u2019s not a fun time. Just start with one area at a time & see how it goes. Unless this has been an ongoing conversation or problem, it sounds like this is more about fitting in than actual concern about body hair. \n\nYou may want to let the salon know about your concerns & little white lie so they don\u2019t blow your cover. \n\nNAH", "Oh, boy, a tough one. Never, ever lie to your kid bcs once they figure it out you'll lose their trust. Your daughter is a young teenager, the worst possible age to lose her trust.

You meant well, I just dont think this is the way.", "NTA for keeping her privates covered. But lying to her sucks.\n\n\nMaybe check with the salon to see what they say. Perhaps you're not lying about restrictions. I would hope that any reputable salon would refuse to do a Brazilian wax/anything involving genitals on anyone under 18. It just rings too close to child abuse.", "NAH but maybe she doesn\u2019t like how it feels down there and was concerned about that- I know I don\u2019t personally it\u2019s a sensory thing", "She should not be waxed at 13 THERE.  You were correct in that.  However,  honesty is the best policy.  Explain to her she is too young.  Give her other options.  Girls are cruel.  And I mean cruel.  Show her how to safely remove it herself.  How to safely upkeep herself.  Or she will find a way to do it by herself and it could end up hurting her.", "Slight YTA for the lying bit, but understandable that you are looking out for your child. If she's never had it done before, she doesn't really know what she's getting into. A boundary of \"we will start with this and build your tolerance up for more sensitive areas\" would be acceptable, and let them know it's not a hopeless no for years, but rather a stepping stone. Lies come out eventually and can hurt her trust in you. There's always the chance she laments she can't get the full thing done to the waxer and they inform her that it's not a rule, and then you've broken her trust about something she feels is important. If she feels she can't trust you over this, she may not come to you for other things in the future.\n\nIf she's legitimately upset crying over not getting it done though, you should REALLY have a good sit down judgement free conversation about why it's so distressing for her to have body hair. It could be self image, teasing, or sensory issues. Heck, I had a college friend who was experiencing gender dysphoria, and they found that full waxing helped them not feel disgusted about themselves. Sit down and listen.

But you might want to check if she's being teased or bullied, or if she's worried that pubic hair will show when she's swimming.

But I'd do it differently.  \n\nTell her that it's very painful and she should see if she likes it first.  So why not start with the legs, and then if she is okay with it then next time she can do more?", "I feel like I've fallen into an insane alternative reality. Why are parents allowing their children to be waxed at all??? What planet do you guys live on? She's 13. Maybe give her one of those at home DIY kits to see if she can stand it. My god she doesn't need to be waxing her WHOLE body at 13. \n\nNTA for not letting her get the whole thing I guess but my god, I can't imagine how many issues she's gonna have as she grows older.", "YTA, you need to talk to her. That strong of a negative reaction indicates she's either trying to be hairless for someone (a boyfriend? a predator?) or that she's worried about hair keeping her from wearing swimsuits. I hope it's the second one and if so you still need to come up with a solution for that together.", "Have a conversation with her. Tell her it\u2019s ok to have preferences but she shouldn\u2019t feel pressured to do it. Ask if anyone said anything\n\nTell her that you felt worried when she was very upset about not getting her private parts waxed. Does her pube area extend past the underwear area? Explain the difference between a bikini wax and brazilian. Pretty sure with a brazilian even your butt crack hair gets waxed, ask her if she understands that, and if there is a reason she would like to remove that hair. NOBODY should be seeing the buttcrack of a 13 year old, even if she\u2019s in the locker room changing she should still have underwear on right? And even if she had to change underwear, pretty sure the butt kind of naturally covers the butt crack hair lol\n\nAnyway, pretty understandable if she wants a bikini wax if her pubic hair is outside the underwear zone. it hurt like a BITCH and will probably deter her from getting the full brazilian. i also recommend buying her a pubic hair trimmer that is a lot safer than shaving!", "NTA. She\u2019s way too young for that. And everyone saying \u201eit\u2019s her body so she should get to choose\u201c- so is getting a piercing or tattoo, and most parents won\u2019t let their 13 year old get one. Also, is it really her choice when she\u2019s been been inundated by messages on social media, porn and teenage boys who\u2019s only experience with women is porn that body hair on a woman is disgusting?\n\nOP, I do think you should have a talk with her about the whole thing.

Does she just hate it personally? Is it a sensory issue? Could be so many things. \n\nI have hated having body hair for as long as it has existed on me. I have very light skin and very dark hair and my mom wouldn\u2019t let me shave till way too late. It was awful and I definitely got teased. I hated bathing suits because my hair was thick and coarse and even just doing the sides/thighs wasn\u2019t enough because there was like, an obvious lumpiness from pubic hair. I literally stole a razor from my mom\u2019s bathroom closet and shaved everything waist down. Somehow or another it came up and she didn\u2019t just tell me she thought it was weird to want to be hairless, but told her friends and tried to make me feel uncomfortable about it. I didn\u2019t care, it was how I wanted my body to look and feel. I was in middle school, so around your daughter\u2019s age. It wasn\u2019t for boys, it wasn\u2019t for a predator, I wasn\u2019t pressured by anyone else. I just wanted it for me and to feel good about myself. \n\nI got a full body wax (sans arms) for my wedding/honeymoon and it was the best decision, but ended up being too costly to maintain. I decided to splurge a few years back and got laser hair removal and it was so worth it.", "I\u2019d just let her get her arms waxed and let a razor do everything else. If she is a swimmer or in a bathing suit a lot then maybe the bikini line. However you do realize that you have to let hair grow out in order to wax it again right?", "Idk what the rules are where you guys live, but at the salons around me, you actually do have to be at least 16 with parents' permission. I know because I wanted one when I was 17 but ultimately changed my mind because I'm a chicken, and didn't want to pretend my old neighbor was my mom because I didn't want to ask my dad lol.\n\n NTA, if she's never even had a wax, this would not be a fun experience for her.

If you think she is being influenced or has negative things in her life that you should be concerned about, address them but don\u2019t relate them to her body hair.

Her negative view of her body hair could be a symptom of a problem, but not the problem itself. And at the end of the day it\u2019s still her choice, so if you don\u2019t want to pay for waxing teach her how to shave or use hair removal cream or epilators.", "Lmaooo sorry to break it to you but your daughter is fucking.

Smooth skin = sexy and attractive, hairy skin = not sexy and attractive.", "Never been interested in waxing anything (natural redhead = light body hair) so I never bothered to look at what a Brazilian involved.\n\nAnd now it\u2019s definitely \u201coh fuck NO.\u201d I mean, hey, you want one, you do you, luv. But I think I\u2019m gonna go curl up in the corner for a bit.", "Good lord. It\u2019s not the hair removal part. \n\nIt\u2019s the thirteen year old child getting peer pressured into having a hairless vagina part. \n\nIt\u2019s the parent not wanting her child\u2019s first wax to include her labia and anus part.", "Right? I go through periods where I completely could not be arsed to shave my legs, armpits or genital area. Nobody says boo. \n\nThe one time someone did was because it was a newer boyfriend who was surprised when I *did* shave, because when we started dating it had been like, a month since I\u2019d done it.", "Ingrown hairs suck so badly. And it feels like everyone needs to try all sorts of different approaches before they find the one that works to mitigate them.

Plus doing it with a professional is better than doing it by yourself at 13, even with a mother's help.", "The 13 year doesn\u2019t have the money to\nPay for this", "Really? I feel like pits are the least painful.  My vote is for the skin right above the ankles.\n\nEdit:  Unless we\u2019re talking about my neck hurting from craning to the side for an extended period of time when waxing my armpits lol", "Same, in my case it was a tie with the bikini area in terms of pain and bleeding. And 25 years later, I still hate the girl who lied to me saying bleeding was a great sign \"because no hair is gonna grow back there now\"... LIAR", "I agree. At sixteen we gave all of our daughters the option of laser hair removal. At eighteen the option was vision correction. I spent decades shaving and wearing contacts. It\u2019s not necessary anymore if you\u2019re willing to accept the risk and pain that comes with the procedures. A very lucky generation in some ways and so unlucky in others.", "Absolutely. Laser doesn't hurt one bit and usually you pay over the time it takes to see results (5 or 6 treatments).\n\nMy daughter won 2 free laser hair removals at the bride expo and she gifted me one of them. Did the armpits and was thrilled with the results. I went and did more. It's been over 10 years and I'm still hair free. It's wonderful.", "Laser hair removal (can be) permanent. Personally if you had asked me as a high schooler if I wanted that, I might have said yes. Now I'm older and I'm a gay woman, and leg hair is considered attractive so I'm glad I didn't. I think it's best to work up to more permanent interventions, and then do the permanent ones once you're sure. If she loves waxing and does it consistently, maybe laser. But don't start with laser.", "NOTHING is necessary at that age!", "Bikini line is definitely necessary to address at this age as she will be in her underwear changing in front of other girls her age for gym.

I usually go to someone to get my downstairs done but she\u2019s not long had a baby so I had a go myself at home and I was growing back within two weeks!

Also leads to compulsive pulling in some and that's not good. Get it off in one go.", "For real! Some people in these comments are *twisted*. Wild...", "I'm not saying it's pointless, just that it's not a necessity that a parent must fully pay for to not be neglectful.", "Is it way better for ingrown hairs?

I just shave my pits at this point lol", "But have you had your upper lip threaded?

My family is very pale with very dark hair. Laser fairly ineffective even though we were great candidates on paper. Our hair is mighty.", "I had laser hair removal on legs, underarms and bikini, but it has grown back sparse and wispy. Still worth it because although I still have to shave, I don't do it very often. \n\nOne benefit to me of doing underlaser is that my sweat doesn't seem to smell anymore. :)", "Laser hair removal isn't actually permanent in most people. It can last for a few years though. Electrolysis is actually permanent but more painful.", "True. And if you have a sensitive skin, you can also develop a rash. Still thinking about waxing at some point. I just want it for hygienic reasons, because I simply smell more when I have longer armpit hair. I don't give a shit about my body hair tbh. I rock hairy legs, because hairy legs >>>> making my eczema worse.\n\nWe should accept body hair more btw. I am so tired of people telling me that I should shave my legs because 'it is not feminine' and 'I won't get a bf with my hairy legs'. My exes didn't really care lol.\n\nIt is just weird that it is normalised for kids now to remove all of their body hair... 13 year olds getting whole body waxes???? And why are we complaining about arm hair as well? Arm hair is soft and barely visible on most people... \n\nNTA OP btw. She has no experience and she is also very young", "Or any age!", "Yeah, but at that age in the lower legs is she feels uncomfortable, but that it. Bikini line only if she already has a lot down there and frequents pools with her friends.", "Wait, what? I must be misunderstanding your comment. They\u2019d also be showering and changing their whole outfit including underwear after gym, so they\u2019d see each other completely naked. Also, why would it be a problem for other girls to see her pubic hair (whether it\u2019s just the bikini line or all of it)? I\u2019m very confused", "This is highly dependent on the person. I got ingrowns and super painful razor burn when I used to shave. No issues from waxing.", "Oof. Threading is rough. I can handle waxing everywhere except my bikini area, but threading is too much for me.", "It\u2019s funny, I find threading to be less painful then waxing.", "I wax my own upper lip, idk exactly how threading works but I assume it\u2019s more akin to plucking multiple hairs at once instead of ripping an entire section off at once, which sounds infinitely more painful lol", "I cannot stand getting hair plucked. Waxing is so much easier for me (note- I rarely get it done and tbh rn my legs are weeks level of fuzzy).", "yep, I went through laser a number of times and it should have worked, but it didn't. I have the hair and skin colors where it should have been effective. So frustrating.", "I was a very hairy kid, which caused significant body issues and bullying. Naturally I asked about laser hair removal for my kids, should they want it. I\u2019ve consistently been told once they hit puberty it\u2019s fine. Not finished, but started. I don\u2019t want them to go through what I did", "Really? I have blonde hair at the root so it's worthless on me too. They told me it would work on my chin area and it came back. So mad. Such a waste.  I hate seeing those ads bc I think they're a total lie and rip off.", "I'm not sure, but I heard that some laser treatments might have to be redone for a short time before they finally don't grow back.", "Depends on the machine. Newer machines remove everything for good, after a good number of visits. Certain areas (face) will never be completely hair-free, but they are the smaller and thus cheaper ones.\n\nI currently go once every eight months, to remove  few remaining ones. I think the machines used are Something called... Alexandrite laser machines? Less painful, more successful at what they do.", "I tried sugar waxing on the recommendation of a friend and broke into the most painful rash all over my body.", "God, thank you. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills reading these replies. If OP's daughter has to remove body hair in order to avoid being tormented at school, then that's understandable, but you *have* to accept the fact that doing so is a band-aid over self-hatred. I'm a very hairy Jewish woman who started shaving my legs at age ten and then my arms at age fifteen after some comments, and whose own mother applauded my efforts at hair removal/thought the hair on my lower back was unsightly. She even agreed to take me for a laser hair removal appointment when I was only fourteen - thank goodness I chickened out after having it demonstrated on my arm, and never went back. \n\nIt took years to realize that my desire to remove my body hair was rooted in internalized misogyny and antisemitism/racism. I haven't shaved my arms since 2017 or my legs since 2019, and haven't done my eyebrows since 2021. Maybe that makes me a man-hating feminist caricature or something, but the fact that no one has so much as mentioned getting the kid some therapy or teaching her to defend herself, in addition to temporary hair removal if her life is that difficult with it, really cheeses me off. \"Waxing feels good\" - well, so does peeling the skin off your lips, hit no one is advocating that.", "I feel like I maybe made myself unclear. No thirteen-year-old child should EVER be obligated to do anything to her pubic hair. Yes, even if it shows. Yes, even if she swims. Whether she has a lot or a little, she doesn't need to do anything to it except leave it alone.", "Kids younger than 13 have access to social media and absorb the \u201cnorms\u201d (i hate it, but it\u2019s reality) of having no hair anywhere for women. Usually showering after gym class isnt mandatory or there are ways to change in the shower and hang your stuff right outside so no one sees you butt naked, just in panties (from my experience in school and gyms now as an adult). Hair can escape the panty line or be visible through if you\u2019ve never done anything. So it\u2019s more than likely she\u2019s uncomfy with not fitting the dumb norm, but at the age of 13, I don\u2019t blame her for wanting to fit in and if it\u2019ll do more therapy-inducing trauma to be ridiculed about hairy parts, I dont see why introducing her to shaving (maybe even waxing if she can deal with the pain of just legs) is that bad. I was one hairy child and had armpit hair from the ripe age of 8 and absolutely loathed swim class because my mother just said people are born hairless and some people aren\u2019t. It didnt scar me because social media wasn\u2019t as big at the time but man if I had to endure  bullying for 5+ years to remove my body hair I can\u2019t imagine how insecure I would be about such a normal thing.\n\nEdit to say that I dont think the mum is unreasonable and I dont want to come off rude, but that\u2019s my take on how the 13 y/o is feeling right about now and I think the kid has a point (totally agree with an above comment about having a conversation about why she wants to remove the hair in the forst place)", "13 year olds aren\u2019t getting Pap smears", "You\u2019re being silly. Those are two very different things.", "What girl gets a pap smear that young? I was like 21 when I got my first one.", "Are you seriously comparing paps to Brazilian waxing?? Go touch some grass.", "Yeeep....  thanks laser for fixing my chest and back but then giving me a white beard on my brown skin just to maximize my facial dysphoria and ensuring i can never properly use makeup or lipstick and look feminine.", "Yep", "Yuck! I never had that.", "I don't think there's harm in doing it during puberty, just that more treatments will be necessary than if you wait, and in many cases there are more cost-effective treatments available. Of course if there are severe body image issues, and you have the money for it, you can make that choice for your family. I'm sorry kids were so shitty to you. I wish we didn't have to consider that as a factor and I hope your kids won't experience the same thing.", "Thank you! I shaved for years because I thought body hair was ugly, or men would judge me unattractive. It was a pain in the ass, complete with ingrown hairs, itching, razor nicks. Finally stopped, and you know what? The people I want to have sex with still find me sexy, and more importantly, *so do I* and no more bother with painful and annoying upkeep. I just trim a little \"down there.\" It took me so long to learn to love my body. We should \ud83d\udcaf be teaching young people that. Not pressuring them to conform to painful beauty standards.\n\nETA - peeling the skin off your lips feels good? Wtf?

Leaves them raw and I know I shouldn't do it.\n\nAnd yeah - I do still shave the pits (deodorant lasts longer) and pubic hair (easier cleanup during that time of the month), but at least the \"aesthetic\" ones are no longer in my routine. \ud83d\ude02", "Who is she showing her pubic area to?", "Tell that to the weirdos trying to start chats with me now, lol", "It cost me $150 + tip to wax JUST my armpits and bikini line professionally. It is incredibly expensive to get a FULL. BODY. Wax and waxing only lasts a few weeks before you have to get it done again. And the amount of hair you have does not impact the cost, bozo, so your \"warewolf\" comment is irrelevant.", "And this particular comment thread is focused on someone suggesting laser hair removal as an alternative.
