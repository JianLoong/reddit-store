My biggest triggers are loud noises and babies/children crying. This can make it difficult going out sometimes without my partner (25F) to reassure me. \n\nMy sister (31F) has 5 kids, the youngest being 5 months old and is quiet the crier. My sister makes a habit of making me and my partner a surprise babysitter or visiting without warning first because she knows I don't go out often because of my PTSD so assumes I never have plans. \n\nI love that my sister wants to see me and I love my nieces and nephews, but what I don't love is their screaming and crying- especially in my own home. If it's in her own home, I have no right to complain- but recently I've had an issue with them visiting. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 has put her foot down many of times and has sent them back home with the excuse 'we are busy' and that if they want us to babysit then tell us in advance instead of expecting us to babysit because she wants a spontaneous weekend away with her boyfriend. \n\nYesterday, me and my fianc\u00e9 were going to go and watch a movie at around 10pm (less children at night), then we heard a knock on the door. She peeped out the window and there was my sister, dressed up with 4 kids and a baby in her arms. I answered the door and she asked me if I could take the kids, to which I informed her me and my fianc\u00e9 were going to watch a film. She became angry and shouted 'I'm a full time Mother! I deserve a break sometimes!' Before I could say something my fianc\u00e9 came up behind me and pulled me gently out the way before saying to my sister. 'If you're a full time Mum does that make us full time Mums too? We seem to see your kids more than they see their dad's. Instead of finding a substitute father through us, how about you stop having kids with deadbeats. She has enough to deal with than you playing pass the parcel with your kids every weekend!' Before she slammed the door. \n\nI received a wave of texts from my sister calling my fianc\u00e9 all the names under the sun, I had enough. I told her I no longer want her or the kids in my house, I then received hateful texts from my Mum telling me I crossed the line and my sister deserved a break.

She summed it up neatly and logically. \n\nDon't weaken on her now after that terrific dismissal of an exploitative and entitled sister. Just the idea that she feels she can dump her kids on you without even asking in advance tells us that the first time you accepted this role of free provider of childcare was a gigantic mistake.\n\nAnd who cares about her texts to you?

Never thought i deserved a break as it was my choice. And that's why i made the choice to have only one kid, to raise him well. Alone with quality Time. Well tell your Mum you're helping sis not put an other kid on the way, as it seems that's what she uses free Time for. I think it's Bad for the kid to see how she tries to get rid of them. Kids should be bathed and in bed at that Time.", "NTA- Your gf\u2019s comments seem a little aggressive, but I\u2019m going to guess they are warranted. \n\nSingle mother\u2019s Don\u2019t automatically deserve breaks because they had children.
