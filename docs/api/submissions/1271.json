We talked almost every day texting wise and every few days on the phone. We\u2019d send photos back and forth (nothing lewd just selfies) so I know it wasn\u2019t a catfish. I confided in my best friend that I was getting feelings hard and I was scared I was being led on - this has happened to me before - and I wasn\u2019t sure what to do. I was told to talk with her about it so I did. \n\nI feel more strongly about her than I\u2019ve felt about any other partner I\u2019ve had and it scared me. I wasn\u2019t sure how she was feeling about me and it made me nervous. Last night we had that phone call and I confessed how I was feeling. I was pretty quickly shot down with a \u201cI\u2019m not sure how I feel about you, it\u2019s more platonic than romantic\u201d and the old: \u201cyou\u2019re a really important and special friend to me\u201d pretty much after that I ended the conversation because I was devastated. When we had first started talking I asked her what she was looking for and she told me a lasting relationship, same as I was. I don\u2019t date to date, I date to find someone to be with for a long time. \n\nTo be clear I never got to meet her in person, every time I asked I was pushed off with a \u201cI\u2019m ashamed of where I live\u201d since she lives with her mom. I understand that and I assured her multiple times, I wasn\u2019t trying to date her for where she lived but for who she was. I never really pushed on it either because it a boundary I wanted to respect so it was only brought up maybe once a month. I found out during that phone call that she didn\u2019t want to meet me in person because she didn\u2019t want me to \u201csay the wrong thing\u201d and make her lose interest then I\u2019d get ghosted like the last guy. According to her I didn\u2019t deserve that treatment. \n\nI felt completely led on by her though especially when I found out she did this last year to a guy for six months. This was told me this last night on the phone. They talked everyday, on the phone and texting, she lost feelings pretty much over night - according to her - and ghosted him. Two months later she was all about him again and started texting him again until she lost interest. \n\nThis is why I cut contact, not because I was friend-zoned but because I didn\u2019t want to end up in the same boat as this other guy. I really like her but I don\u2019t think I could handle her breaking my heart even more. So am I the asshole for not sticking around? Because I sure feel like an asshole.\n\nTLDR: She played with a guys feelings before and admitted it to me after friendzoning me, I didn\u2019t stick around and feel like an asshole for not giving her another chance.\n\nEdit: I did forgot to add that while we were talking she initiated most of any flirting, sending couples TikTok videos, and started calling me pet names and things like that.
