{"id": 18993, "submission_id": "140pbdj", "title": "AITA for yelling at my roommate for not sharing ice cream", "selftext": "I live with my sister and her boyfriend, who I will refer to as a roommate. He is my age and was my friend before he met my sister. I often bring home food to share with them, because I like to be able to eat with them and bond. They do not spend a lot of time with me otherwise because I am autistic and tend to be really annoying.   \nAbout three weeks ago, I (24F) bought my roommate (24M) and sister (19) about four gallons of ice cream and toppings for us all to share. I intended for them to take as much as they wanted and while they took a lot more than I had expected, I did not complain. I DID tell them they could have some.   \nBut a few days ago my sister comes to me and explains that our roommate bought ice cream for himself and that neither of us are to eat it, as it is just for him and he is having a bad week, OK, Fine by me, he has every right to get stuff for just himself. It was weird that she brought it up though and it felt kind of targeted to me. I have NEVER taken any food of his at any point. He writes his name on stuff and I don\u2019t touch it, so why the clarity with this ice cream?\n\n  \nHere is where I became angry, and I am thinking I am probably unreasonable and that my anger was a result of my mental issues and not any real slight on me. I need other opinions.   \nthis morning I spot my sister and him eating the ice cream, they don\u2019t say anything to me, and do not make any move to offer me any. I make a sarcastic comment about him not sharing when I shared so much fairly recently. And he replies really in an irritated voice with \u201cI only had one bowl.\u201d   \nthe thing is, it was a CEREAL BOWL sized serving of ice cream, absolutely loaded with toppings like it\u2019s no weigh day at the froyo shop. I don\u2019t know if he had more after that or if my sister ate the rest, but he certainly had more than enough of my ice cream to not be considered an insignificant amount. So him acting like it was such an insignificant share pissed me off. Not only could he not be bothered to share with me, he goes out of his way to tell me he won\u2019t share with anyone, only to share with everyone in the household OTHER THAN ME. And then on top of that, he dismisses what I shared with him as being insignificant.  \nI under stand that she is his girlfriend but he specifically had her tell me he wasn\u2019t sharing this ice cream with ANYBODY, so it feels really shitty that he actually only meant that I specifically could not have any. \n\n  \nI yelled at them I would never share any food with them again.   \nI stormed off and apologized later. He and my sister both agree that I was being unreasonable. I spoke to my mother about it though and she agreed with me that he in the wrong and I should not share food with them anymore.   \n\n\nAm I the asshole for yelling at him when he really did not have any obligation to share with me?", "created_utc": 1685910614, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/140pbdj/aita_for_yelling_at_my_roommate_for_not_sharing/", "score": 120, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just because you offered your food does not obligate anyone else to act reciprocally.\n\nThis sounds like it might be more than about the ice cream - if he was your friend first and now you\u2019re on the outside, you might be feeling hurt and unable to express it. This living situation with you as a third wheel seems to be taking a toll, and maybe you should think about other options if this will continue being hard for you.", "Soft YTA. You were indeed singled out and clearly they are not as considerate and welcoming as you are and you have a right to feel badly.  However, you were rude. You yelled at them when, sadly, they can be as selfish and thoughtless as they wish and selfish and thoughtless they truly are.", "NTA \n\nThey have no issue with eating your food and treats but unwilling to share with you. Stop sharing,  including with your sister\n She can purchase her own stuff.", "OP ESH but let me be clear you suck less than your roommates.\n\nmy only negative thoughts on how you handled things was you getting angry, yelling at them for not sharing ice cream they bought for him (which was serving a personal reason). you also started a fight by giving a sarcastic reminder that they weren't sharing with you (unprovoked, I might add), otherwise you'd have been %100 NTA.\n\nYour roommates sound bad as they were being selfish despite you sharing your food & stuff.  When cooler heads prevail, it might be worthwhile to sit with your sister (without her BF) and explain things from your perspective to her.\n\nTell her how before these events you were happy to share items but are now rethinking this policy due to their conduct.  Tell her that her choice of words came across as accusatory and that you have a hard time seeing it any other way.  Ask her about why it was important that they highlight borders with their food and items (other than the ice cream) with you and depending on this answer, suggest to her about making new house rules for shared & non-shared items.", "You: bought ice cream for everyone. Invited them to share.\n\nHim: Bought ice cream for himself, to get over a rough week.\n\nIf he shares with his gf, then maybe his rough week has gotten better, and he doesnt need all of the ice cream.\n\nIt sounds like you're more upset that he was sending messages through your sister, and not commnicating with you directly. \n\nIt also sounds like you're using food as a method to get them to spend time with you. Real friends don't need to be bribed into spending time with you. I imagine this is a lot ot handle emotionally, and maybe you also miss your friend too.  \n\nMayb it is time to see if this living arrangement is working for your benefit, or it they are stressing you out by making you feel a bit left out.", "YTA. You were profoundly bitter about fucking ice cream. You made YOUR enjoyment of sharing food someone else\u2019s responsibility. Grow up.", "YTA. It's nice of you to share with them, but when you share, people are not always going to share back.  Make a mental note of it, and you don't have to share with them again. If you do share with them again, don't look for anything back from them. Someone else will come along who will share with you.", "Sorry man, YTA. Don\u2019t share with them again though. They were being kinda rude downplaying your generosity while taking full advantage of it, but you can\u2019t give a gift and then expect something in return.", "The emotions are so high, and the stakes are so low. YTA. They don\u2019t owe you anything.", "YTA. You have no more right to your roommate\u2019s food than you do to rummage through their wallet. Well and good that you decided to share your ice cream, but if that meant that they could never have ice cream again without you having a right to it, that doesn\u2019t work.", "I think this is a situation where both are true: you did overreact. But you also should not share food with them anymore.\n\nOn the specific question asked, I guess YTA.", "I'd have to say soft yta. Just keep separate foods and move on from this event. Your mom was right to advice you that, go back and speak to her again if you need more reassurance. You don't have to stop eating meals together just put them together( and buy them) separately.\n\nEdited bc I realized I didn't answer the question, for screaming at both your sister and her bf.. you could also consider thinking of him as that,  her boyfriend and not your roommate", "YTA- You said it yourself, he bought it for himself, and does not have to share. Sure, he maybe should to repay your kindness, but doesn't have to.", "YTA..  you want to share your food with them. That's on you. \nThey dont want to share with you and they don't have to. Your annoying as per you. You have no right to yell and act like a AH", "I am going to say NTA, but I think you picked the wrong thing to argue about.\n\n>I make a sarcastic comment about him not sharing when I shared so much fairly recently.\n\nIf you had really wanted to start some drama with them and see whose being straight with you, then you could have always said, \"I see you changed your mind, (insert sister's bf's name here), and are willing to share now. May I have some?\".\n\nIt would've been so telling to see their response.\n\n>And he replies really in an irritated voice with \u201cI only had one bowl.\u201d\n\nthe thing is, it was a CEREAL BOWL sized serving of ice cream, absolutely loaded with toppings like it\u2019s no weigh day at the froyo shop. I don\u2019t know if he had more after that or if my sister ate the rest, but he certainly had more than enough of my ice cream to not be considered an insignificant amount\n\nI am also confused about this paragraph though which is why I think someone is withholding infromation, whether it be you or your sister. You see, you mentioned buying **4 Gallons** of Ice Cream. Even amongst three people, I am not sure how that would've lasted three weeks or less. I'm assuming you remember how much you ate. If you ate the majority, even if he had one cereal bowl size it shouldn't have made a dent in that amount. I'm assuming that you didn't eat the majority though because you are also mentioning that you don't know how much your sister ate. Thus, I have some theories...\n\nTheory 1: Your sister and her bf threw away a lot of ice cream because they were probably mad that you got so much and that there was probably little space to put much else in the freezer, depending on which type of freezer you have.\n\nTheory 2: Your sister has an eating problem and ate the majority of the ice cream. However, she was embarassed and trying to hide that fact and instead blamed you for the ice cream going missing, when her bf wanted some, which is why she spun a story to you about not sharing the ice cream he specifically got. This would be supported by potential weight gain.\n\nTheory 3: This is part of some overarching plot to kick you out of their place. Have there been other unreasonable behaviors. May also be explained by any weight gain of your sister's.", "YTA. You don't get to share with people and get angry when they don't share back. Then just don't share at all.", "YTA\n\nYou threw a temper tantrum, which you are entirely too old for. You chose to buy ice cream to share, which is great. He bought ice cream for himself after a bad week and didn\u2019t want anyone else eating it, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. He then decided to allow HIS GIRLFRIEND to have some, again nothing wrong with that. He wasn\u2019t obligated to offer you any and you weren\u2019t entitled to any. Making sarcastic comments and having a fit were unneeded responses to that.", "ESH you offered the ice cream to them with no restrictions. It would have been nice for them to do the same but you can't be made that the broke a rule you never put in place. You didn't need to yell at them. Just know that the next time you buy ice cream or anything else don't share.", "YTA you sound like a nightmare to live with", "NTA. i\u2019d take that really personal and be very annoyed also. don\u2019t share your food with these people anymore. they sound like children", "NTA... mom is wise, stop sharing food with them. Get a pen and start labeling your groceries", "NTA\n\nHe is a huge asshole and why tf does your sister let him treat you like that? Why did you apologize?", "NTA please do not buy food to specifically share with them. They should have shared his ice cream with you but were being unkind excluding you.", "Im curious as to why you refer to him as roommate and not your sister\u2019s bf? \n\nESH \n \nYou for expecting or thinking that because you share food everyone needs to do the same. Also for being mad that he shared with his gf. You did overreact out of nowhere. It was his icecream and he can share with who he wants\n\nThem for taking advantage of you buying food and acting like it is insignificant.", "Yta but not by much I do agree tho seems like the best bet is to stop sharing all around tho", "ESH, this is just too much over ice cream. Both of you guys needs to respect each other\u2019s wishes. This level of petty between you guys is immature and unwise considering the amount of people who live in the home together.", "ESH - you shouldn't yell.
