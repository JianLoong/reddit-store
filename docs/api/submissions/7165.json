Her parents punished her presumably because they agree with you. Why do you call them homophobic and why are they now blackballed?", "YTA - hi, lesbian here. When you're that young you make a lot of stupid mistakes, but literally everyone, including you, normally gets the chance to grow up into a well rounded adult. You saying that colleges should know what she said at 17 so they can not let her in. No dude.  A kid should be able to have the chance to grow up and not have their future ruined this early over slurs. If the kid had made more slurs, then yeah you shouldve told the family. But they literally made her volunteer for months. To help her mature and change her mind. Your sister did the right thing. You just showed that you're not that good of a person. You need to grow up, don't throw stones at glass houses. You are not a good ally. A good ally educates a homophobe to change their mind. Quick edit: by the way, you know what's the best way to get someone more entrenched in their way of thinking? By doing immature stuff like this. One day you're gonna mess up at something and I hope that they don't give you a second chance so that maybe you'll have some introspection on how you reacted to your sister and her family", "YTA - I don't support homophobia in the smallest amount myself.  You took this as your own personal conquest when it had absolutely nothing to do with you.  The meme wasn't about you or your cousin.  She was young and dumb.  Sounds like she was given an adequate punishment that involved volunteering her time to show her how her actions effect others.  Who are you to step in and DECLARE the punishment wasn't enough.  You still don't have all of the info and are just reacting.  Also, she's family as well.\n\nMy advise to you is to get that chip off of your shoulder.  It's not going to be easy, but it will help you a lot later in life.  Not every battle is yours to join.  Stay in your lane.", "I\u2019ve read your comments, and my god, you\u2019re unhinged.\n\nYour black-and-white morality and \u201cno redemption\u201d policy will definitely complicate your future life in our society, because most situations are nuanced, and not easily resolved by your \u201coff with her head\u201d attitude. \n\n\rAnd I\u2019m queer, so my perspective on LGBTQ+ matters is more valid, than yours. \n\n\rYTA. Seek help, stop the witch hunt.", "YTA. Like they made her volunteer, took away her phone and more unnamed punishments FOR months.\n\nYou know how you don't change peoples minds? Holding something that they've been punished for, for the rest of their lives. It's not even that you think the punishment wasn't properly served or anything, you think that a 16 year old should not have a future because they did something stupid.\n\nYou literally said it yourself, you think her life should end. Only death can be an adequate punishment in your eyes. Your mindset is disgusting.", "Edited, was previously marked as not enough information\n\n~~Is this a continued pattern of behavior or has she learned?~~\n\n~~Is it intentional bigotry or childish stupidity for the sake of trying to seem \"cool\" or \"funny\"?~~\n\nYTA.\n\n She was punished, and you haven't said that this has continued. You say she \"almost\" got away scott-free, but she faced repercussions. When someone does something wrong, you have to let them grow if they seem capable of it.", "~~I N F O~~: Are they actually homophobic in that they continue to make comments, or was this just something stupid that a 16 year old girl did once?\n\nYTA. She was rightfully punished and you thought she deserved more punishment even though you don't really know if she's had any other homophobic tendencies? Nobody  deserves to have their whole life ruined for a terrible meme they made in their teens.", "YTA  people make mistakes, especially young people.   Most don't deserve to be 'burned to the ground'  for a juvenile mistake.  If she was punished & learned to be a better person, that's the desired result.  No one is perfect.  Remember how you have treated this family next time you make a mistake & want to be forgiven & move on with your life.", "YTA I suspect in the long run the best thing for your cousin and her parents is going to be away from there toxic extended family. \n\nYou should probably get into anger management and a class in mind your own business. Parents handled it. She made a mistake at 17, I would love to see your past.", "YTA\n\nNot sure what the proper term here is, it's related to virtue signaling. But it seems to me that you just wanted your entire family to know how progressive you are. \"Look at me! I don't tolerate bigotry!\"\n\nYour cousin did something stupid when she was 16, and was appropriately punished for it. You don't even know exactly what she did. You have no indication that she is still homophobic (and she might not ever have been.) At this point, I would much rather sit at a table with your cousin than with you. Severe case of moral superiority and self-righteousness here.", "YTA She did something wrong one and a half years ago, which she was punished for by her own parents. You then took it upon yourself to call everyone and have her entire family ostracized? What a spiteful, bitter, bullying thing to do. It was dealt with by her own parents at the time. Of course they deleted the meme, it was offensive and needed taking down. The first thing any one rectifying anything offensive, is to take it down. Your vindictive, hateful behaviour requires therapy.", "Your self-righteousness is off the charts. Not justifying what your cousins did, but my goodness. Grow up. YTA.", "As a member of the LGBT community myself,  I can say that YTA definitely. She was punished. You have shown no proof that she hasn't learned her lesson. It was messed up what she did before, but she learned. If we act as if a mistake as a teen is going to follow them forever, why would anyone want to improve once they've already messed up? If she becomes the biggest ally there is, but she messed up that one time as a dumb kid, should she always be considered a homophobe? What if she comes out in five, ten years as part of the community? Does one mistake completely invalidate her? \n\nTake a chill pill. I read your comments, and they seriously make me crazy. You want to ruin her life over a mistake she's learned from. Grow up.", "YTA. This is such an insane reaction. How could you possibly think this was in any way justified?", "YTA\n\nShe was caught, her parents quickly punished her, she fulfilled the terms of her punishment, and her brother just existed. \n\nI don\u2019t understand how her parents and brother are also homophobes. \n\nHas she not shown remorse or changed behavior? Did her parents excuse her actions?\n\nI could understand giving her the side eye or being guarded around her for a bit but\u2026.this?", "YTA. You're not her parent. She made a horrible choice, and her parents punished her for it for months. Do you think maybe the 17yo learned her lesson and that's why she told you her crime 18 months later? Why do you want to burn her to the ground and kick her out of the family over this?\n\nIf she continues with that attitude, that's one thing, but a one-off event that she was already punished for should be considered part of her record but otherwise inactive history.\n\nEDIT: and why do you slip up and say it's your \"sister's homophobia\" in your 'why you think you may be the \\*sshole' comment? Is this even real?", "wow.. way to teach and promote acceptance by hanging her up a year ANDA  HALF later on. she has been punished. and probably spaced out from those friends because of her punishment via social media.  \n\n\nteenagers move on fast once someone cant be in the \"in\" in all ways possible.  \na group of friends can rlly warp your behavior and thinking at these ages.  \n\n\nyou have absolutely no idea if shes changed or not and just decided to go on some holier than thou crusade.  \n\n\nYTA", "YTA. How are they  Homophobes? They punished her and deleted the stupid meme, what did you wanted? She's 17 and dumb the fact that you have split your family in half only shows how little compassion and forgiveness you all have, if we are not able to forget the stupidity of being young and growing the world is pretty much over. You are an AH and hopefully someday it will be recorded and somebody like you will destroy your life too.", "YTA - I\u2019m saying this as a gay man. Your cousin made a terrible and hateful mistake and has been punished for it already. For you to throw her to the wolves and hang her out to dry with the rest of the family, is inappropriate. People deserve the right to learn from their mistakes and to grow, especially people as young as 17.\n\nUnless she demonstrates continued bigoted behavior, I don\u2019t think this is an appropriate response. This response makes me think there were preexisting issues with this cousin and you struck when the iron was hot to throw her under the bus.\n\nGood for you for standing up for LGBT rights, but it is not your place to be judge jury and executioner regarding your cousins punishment.", "You torched your whole family to punish a 16 year old girl's mistake.\n\nHer parents took it seriously. They just didn't go announcing it. They didn't owe you that information. They parented their child.\n\nYou saying you wouldn't mind if she was dead makes you the bad guy. It's too bad your parents can't make you volunteer and take your phone away.\n\n\nYTA", "YTA whole heartedly! \n\nLife isn\u2019t black and white. She made a mistake and her parents punished her. She presumably learned from her mistake and has not made any homophobic comments since or even before this instance. Teenagers make stupid decisions all the time. \n\nYour not the shining knight you think you are. People are redeemable \n\nAnd that\u2019s coming from someone who\u2019s actually gay.\n\nWe don\u2019t need protecting from a 16 year old who made one misguided snap.", "YTA I'm gay and I hate this virtue signaling shit.", "So.. what did you expect them to do with the homofobic comments? Frame them? How is removing something vile not the best course of action after she's been punished? 18 months ago no less!?\n\nYTA for butting in on something that happened 18 months ago and was in no way about you. \n\nTeenagers sometimes say stupid shit. They should be punished, but not a year and a half later by someone who pries and then spreads the info to others when it didn't involve them to begin with.", "I dislike what your cousin did but she is young and mistakes are made when young. It is unfair to ruin her life within the family over a mistake. In fact it shows a certain level of maturity AND accountability that she owned up to what she did when asked.\n\nI have a brother who is gay and it is difficult when family members, especially cousins, make their little comments. You can see him get hurt, but he takes the opportunity to educate them and love them despite their comments and occasional insults.\n\nI do think tearing apart a family is fair as her parents took the proactive steps to punish her and attempt to correct her behavior.\n\nAt the end of the day, you took what was a private matter for the parents to handle and made it into a gossip headline.\n\nYTA.", "YTA - I believe in facing the consequences of one\u2019s actions\n\nAnd she did\n\nShe messed up, she was punished for it yet you think her entire life should be ruined\n\n\u201cBurned to the ground\u201d\n\nJesus people can make mistakes and then do better in the future\n\nIf we applied your view point most people wouldn\u2019t have a future, we all have done something that someone out there would  consider unforgivable \n\nEven you, I\u2019m sure there is something you have done that to some one, or a group of people, is unforgivable, should you lose your entire future over if?\n\nShe was punished, let it lay\n\nHow is anyone suppose to learn from their mistakes? Grow? Change? Become a better person?\n\nWith people like you around they would  never get the chance \n\nI grew up in an area where causal racism and homophobia was normal everyone did it, I heard it from an early age, so I repeated that stuff, it wasn\u2019t until I was older and I educated myself that I realised I was wrong and I changed \n\nIf I had someone like you around I likely would have never gotten the chance to change and grow and be a better person", "Uh... YTA. I say this as a member of the LGBT\n\nShe did a shitty thing, got caught, her parents punished her, she carried out that punishment... And, what? Has she learned, who's to say. But why tf are her parents and brother also written off? Why is she written off after one mistake (that she atoned for) without being given a chance to see if she's changed?\n\nShe's 18, for fuck's sake, technically still a teenager. People do stupid things. She made gay jokes and used a slur, gross, yeah. She didn't go beat up a gay kid. You had no need to go absolutely nuclear and split the family up over this.", "YTA, how do you expect people to learn and correct their actions when you do not give them space to do so.", "YTA. Holy shit. What puts you in any position to assemble a jury of your cousins to determine how another family deals with their shit? And assuming the cousin's remark wasn't directed AT someone in your family, FFS give some room to let other people learn from mistakes. Perhaps it would have been an opportunity for your cousin who recently came out to share their own experience. \n\nYour entitlement is almost comical... but mainly just AH-ish.", "YTA. the incident happened 18 months ago, she faced consequences and now your bringing it up all over again and trying to destroy her life? \nStay off social media for a while, your addiction has you trying to cancel family members.", "YTA\n\nI'm Pan, I go all ways, and you literally ruined your cousins life after she already was punished for it. You took it upon yourself to be a social justice warrior, when it was already taken care of. Idefk what her parents or brother did either this is extreme as feck.", "OP doesn't even care that they're the AH! All their comments are justifying and making it worse and digging themselves into a deeper hole of AH-ness. Seems like they just want attention tbh.", "Sounds like YTA, I don't condone homophobia but it sounded like she was punished already and I think it's irresponsible to take justice into your own hands especially when we're talking about someone's chances at getting into college.", "YTA \nPeople make dumb mistakes ESPECIALLY young teenagers. She wasn\u2019t bullying anyone specifically and she did get in trouble for it, obviously embarrassed by it that\u2019s why she took so long to CONFIDE in her cousins for her MISTAKES. You\u2019re wrong for this. Life isn\u2019t black and white and you should have taken that time to talk to her and make sure she understand what she did was wrong not crucify her", "Let me get this straight- you & half the family have cancelled this girl AND HER PARENTS WHO PUNISHED HER? AND HER BROTHER WHO DID NOTHING AT ALL?\n\nYTA\n\nIf she gave any indication she hadn't learned what she did was wrong & why it was wrong, you'd have a cause for this grudge. That ain't the case.", "YTA: You and your cousin are young and are going to make stupid mistakes. What she did was horrible and you can choose to hold it against her for the rest of her life. Hopefully she learned from this mistake and has realized what an ah she was. If she has, she is still young enough to be a good person.\n\nSame goes for you. Telling the entire family and destroying not just her, but her parents and brother's relationships with half the family is a super ah move. Her parents aren't homophobes. They punished her, but your actions are punishing them. They have every right to hold it against you for the rest of your life.\n\nHopefully you'll learn about the difference between being right and being effective. This wasn't right.", "> good, she should get burned to the ground over this\n\nOof. I made some ignorant comments in my teen years. As do most teenagers. Because teenagers. This is a *harsh* take. \n\nAppropriate punishment (sounds like her parents addressed it) and learning from the experience (can\u2019t be sure of this based on your side of the story) seem like the best course of action.\n\nIf you want to disassociate with her, fine. If people *ask* what happened, go ahead and share. But to go out of your way to tell everyone about a situation that *appears to already have been addressed*? That\u2019s what plants me on the side of YTA.", "YTA and you\u2019re weird. Please don\u2019t become a cop or teacher.", "\u201cJudge, jury and executioner all rolled into one you are\u201d. \n\nYou\u2019re all kids, your brains aren\u2019t even cooked yet.

Do people not get second chances in your world? She made a mistake at what 17? Did you never make mistakes when you were young? I take it your halo is very well polished! She made a mistake, she was punished and now has lost half of her family over it? Yeah great move from you.", "I\u2019m concerned about all the people who think this is acceptable. She was 17. She did something dumb. Make it a teaching moment. Help her learn. Especially since she\u2019s your family!! But, it sounds like you want her to face permanent consequences and suffer indefinitely for this. Why? This doesn\u2019t teach tolerance. It makes her more likely to hold onto those ignorant views since everyone else has turned their backs. This is not being an ally, this is being a bully.", "What punishment would have made you happy? Clearly, you don't think hers was good enough. Do you think that ostracizing her, her parents, and for some reason, her brother from half of their family for one incident of saying something bad is appropriate? \n\nShe shouldn't have said what she did. I don't think anyone is arguing that. But if you give up on someone after one mistake, which they did pay for, and you have said it was isolated, then you're going to end up very alone on your high horse. You have to give people room to improve themselves. We've all said incredibly stupid things. The point is we learn, grow and usually wish we hadn't. By kicking her out of your family, you're shoving her towards the people you hate so much. YTA.", "YTA. you did that shit for clout.", "YTA.\n\nOh, fuck off with the superficial moral high-ground. \n\nShe got aptly punished and all this does is make her resent the community more.", "Wow! You must be such an amazing person that has never said or done anything wrong. It sounds like her parents took this very seriously. She had no previous history of making these comments and hasn\u2019t done it since. People are allowed to make mistakes.  They can sincerely apologize and move on.  You want a 16 year olds whole life ruined for one bad decision.  You need to get over yourself. Such a massive YTA.", "YTA. I was gonna say N T A or at least E S H but I\u2019ve read your other comments. \n\nYou have no actual info on what she did just a shred of info yet went scorched earth. \n\nYou admit you never heard her ever be homophobic besides this one incident when she was 16/17. \n\nMarking everyone in her immediate family as homophobic cuz they made her delete the snap. \n\nAnd now you\u2019re even talking about how you plan on contacting any colleges she applies to, to basically try and get her blacklisted. \n\nThis all over again one incident as a teenager. You are point blank harassing her now. This isn\u2019t about you trying to protect your other cousin or family. This is you finding someone to persecute IMO.", "YTA. Your cousin seemed to have learned her lesson. While it happened almost two full years ago, you still decided it was your job to take your own version of what you believe justice is into your hands. \n\nYou broke up portions of your family in this. You didn\u2019t have to talk to her if you wanted, but you got others involved to persecute her and her innocent family.", "The amount of hate in you is greater than the amount of \u201chate\u201d in your cousin. YTA. \n\nAt least there\u2019s a possibility hers is a joke or that she doesn\u2019t yet understand the gravity of that word which has been used almost universally by teenagers that are now in their 20s-70s and understand that the word shouldn\u2019t be used.", "YTA, mind your own fucking business, she was a teen, her parents seriously punished her, the world moves on. I hope to God you never make any mistakes in your life.", "YTA.  She made a very stupid mistake and was punished for it.

Not every offence is a hanging offence. \n\nYTA", "YTA, I\u2019m sorry OP. I\u2019m a member of the LGBTQ community also and I totally, 110%, get your righteous fury. I do. But I think deleting the meme also makes it so that it doesn\u2019t get repurposed by other homophobes or continue to do harm outside of what your cousin did, if that makes sense. As someone who\u2019s just fucking tired of seeing shit like that, I\u2019m honestly glad the meme got deleted so that it wasn\u2019t still out there causing harm. Was it probably deleted so that it didn\u2019t put a stain on her reputation? Maybe, but shit on the internet lasts forever if someone is determined enough to dig it back up. \n\nAs for outing that to the entire family\u2026 like most other people are saying in here, it could be that she\u2019s changed. But let\u2019s say she hasn\u2019t. If you want someone to stop being a -phobe of any kind you have to educate them with patience, not fury. And trust me when I say I know that that\u2019s difficult \u2014 I am NOT a patient educator. I don\u2019t have the emotional energy for it.

Look what you are doing and trying to justify. Her parents punished her for her actions and yet you think their lives should also be destroyed because they didn\u2019t punish her hard enough and long enough.

You think that because of something dumb she did as a kid she should be shunned by her family, unable to get into college. Why not go the whole hog and brand her on the face.

All you are teaching her is that her only friendship prospects lay with other homophobes and bigots and she is going to continue the hate onto her future kids. This could have been a teaching moment but you choose to push her towards the people you hate rather than bringing her to the good guys.\n\nI hope you never become a judge, you\u2019d hang people after they served their sentences.", "YTA.  First of all deleting something off the internet does not mean it is gone forever so she still could suffer other repercussions from her actions.  You can't seem to accept that she was punished, and not lightly, for her actions.  Also, anyone who is truly against homophobia would not want any of it on the internet, anywhere.  Having it out there encourages others to post the same sort of stuff.  The fact that you think is should stay up shows this is a personal vendetta against her, not a problem with homophobia.  Burning the entire family over it is unhinged.", "YTA. I\u2019m queer and this is not the way forward. Your cousin did something wrong and was punished for it. She\u2019s done.

They calmly said \"we don't use that word in this family\" and then changed the subject. That was enough that I never did it again and did some real learning about ableism and how to be an ally. Twenty years in and we still have respect and love for each other. It sounds like your cousin was similarly lucky to have a family that would tell her to get her shit together and hold her accountable without writing her off forever. You could learn from them.\n\nThere are two ways to have fewer homophobes in the world, I think the best option is to teach homophobes to be better whenever possible. Even better that the people doing it aren't queer. And yes, I'm queer, and still believe that this was handled appropriately without you putting her on blast. Putting the post back up would just increase the chances that a queer person sees it and is hurt. Not harming the marginalized community you're claiming to protect is like step one of allyship.", "This post reminds me of how grateful I am to have gone through high school during the age of beepers.

Would you become an LGBTQIA+ ally, work to check your privilege, and be more empathetic? Or would you be more likely to say \"Screw you, if you're going to ostracize me then I'm going to double down and ostracize you back\"? I think the latter reaction is more likely, and I think there are a lot of people who have learned to think that way about a number of topics because of an experience like the one you inflicted.\n\nSo not only are YTA, you may have undermined your cousin's ability to become a better person and robbed the world of someone who could have become a real ally.

That is excessive. \n\nYTA, a thousand times.", "So you want her kicked out of her house for doing something stupid? Jeez I would not want to be friends with a person like you at all. I would know not to ever trust you with anything.", "I hope you make a mistake one day and have someone treat you like there is no hope for you to change and grow. People are never the same as they were when they were a teenager. You\u2019re very young and entirely clueless about how the world actually works.", "That isnt how the world works, nor is it how it should.\n\nThere is a reason why even a life sentence is 20 years.\n\nAll punishments end, people can change and making a dumb as fucking joke shouldn't.ruin your entire life. Your scorched earth policy is what is in the wrong here.", "You have never been a parent.  It takes a special type of person to walk away from their children.  Children make mistakes, and it the parents job to teach them what is right and wrong, if you ever have children, and one of them makes a mistake, I hope you wont hold it against them for their rest of their lives.", "I think you should have to carry a copy of this post around to have proof of your inability to believe ppl can redeem themselves\n\nDo you hear how batshit that sounds?", "I say this as a queer woman\u2026wtf is wrong with you? She isn\u2019t out here bullying gay people and making their lives miserable. She made a stupid video and got punished!", "Touch grass", "You are unhinged", "Please correct me if I am wrong, but I am reading this as \"A punishment was served and did not align with my own morals, therefore I need to further punish this person\".\n\nAs you have pointed out in the other comments, you have no recollection of this cousin being a bigot up until now. That being said, who knows who says what behind closed doors but this is the info we have. If anything ESH just because she did make the post, but I can't say that.\n\nYTA. You seem to lack any empathy. The fact that a 16 y/o made a terrible lapse in judgement, that lapse of judgement was wrong and hurt people, but that they were punished pretty much as harshly as you can punish a 16 y/o, and you decided that a second, life-following, and worse punishment needed to happen. YTA because you decided to be a vigilante and take matters into your own hands.\n\nAre you of the opinion that all of those 13 y/o boys screaming slurs at people in a Call of Duty match are truly doing it to be hateful? Are you of the opinion that one cannot learn from and/or adapt to the mistakes of their past? One cannot grow to become a better person, and hell, possibly become an LGBTQ+ ally? Do you not want people to convert from being hateful to accepting of people in these groups?\n\nWhether you meant to or not, it seems like you probably just gave that chunk of the family a reason to be hateful in general now.", "That\u2019s a completely insane punishment for her crime was.", "As a queer person, you are UNHINGED and not an ally. I would legitimately prefer your cousin to you. She did a crappy thing, but she seems to have done the work (volunteering, etc.) to repair that. You on the other hand have gone full nuclear and want to destroy them. You need serious help and to learn that you are in the wrong.", "This is as extreme as the hugely conservative and homophobic guy I used to know that said he\u2019d like to \u201cput all f*****s on an island and blow it up.\u201d \n\nYou gotta let it go. Use this energy for something that actually deserves this much attention.", "No. No they should not have. \n\nWhat the fuck?? You want her to be held \u201caccountable\u201d for what she did, but the punishment doesn\u2019t fit the crime. Your draconian bullshit is the same mindset that cuts people\u2019s hands off for stealing. \n\nSo many actually queer people have weighed in, and I\u2019m one more. You wanna know something HORRIBLE?! I called someone the f-word \u2014 repeatedly. I was 10? or so, in 5th grade, and I genuinely didn\u2019t know what the word meant. (but you know, no excuses!!) My friends said it meant \u201ca bad person\u201d, so I used that word in that way. \n\nDo I deserve permanent exile because of it? \n\nShould I return my Women\u2019s Studies degrees, because I\u2019m now unworthy? What about my job \u2014 should I quit that? Stop working with LGBT youth in desperate need of a role model, because I used a slur as a child? \n\nYour reaction to this is appalling. \n\nYour cousin did something shitty, yeah, but this isn\u2019t an established pattern nor is it being ignored by her parents. It was DEALT WITH. And then you came in and nuked her family life - why? Because you know better than her parents? Fuck that shit.", "YTA - You\u2019re insane", "Let me give you some life advice: fighting hate with hate never works. \n\nYou fight hate with understanding and love. What your cousin did was wrong. Kids are stupid, but people deserve to learn. If they don't nobody would be left, even you.", "Stop trying to ruin your cousins life for something stupid she shared on Snapchat when she was 16 or 17. She was a kid, and got rightfully punished. She even came clean to you and your sister.\n\nUnless you've never made even one mistake in your entire existence, quit actively trying to ruin her life you fucking pinecone.", "Do you not believe in redemption, or allowing people (especially young people) to make mistakes and learn from them?!\n\nGod help you if you make *any* mistake in your life and someone like you is around.  \n\n\nHonestly, this is not ally behavior, and it's not even human behavior.   Take a long look in the mirror and get off your self-righteous horse.", "How about someone CSI you and submit copies of your post and comments and your bullying ways to any colleges and work places you apply so as to protect students and employees from your toxic behaviour?\n\nYou are only 19? Goodness! Stop pretending to be high amd mighty. Even the LGBTQ+ members themselves in the comment section came to the defense of the girl and were not supportive of your actions.\n\nYour actions do not seem to be the result of indignation for the community. It seems to be personal vendetta against your cousin and her family.", "As an 18 year old are you sure you got your age right? These are actions and opinions closer to maybe a 13 year old.", "So you want her life to be ruined, to be absolutely lonely since she won't have friends or family, Then maybe get kicked out of college, being homeless, die and rot in the deepest circle of hell, right?", "Instead of turning this into a lesson you\u2019ve blackballed this person, how will that help society in the long run? Also, why not reply to the multitude of comments from LGBTQ+ people who explain it from their side?", "How does this benefit queer people? Like, materially? Her punishment seemed severe enough that she at least won't do that shit again. \n\nHell for all we know she'll discover she's queer in a few years, and glad that she was given the space to fuck up. You need to really think about why you're being such a cop about a distasteful snapchat -- it's not like your cousin was harassing queer classmates or bullying anyone.", "I never said they did.", "Wait really? Is there a specific subgroup or just random individuals? Because as a catholic myself, though not a practicing one, Catholicism is definitely a subset of Christianity. Though there can be a bias against those who just refer to themselves as Christians, so I could see room for a misunderstanding there.", "He sounds like he has other mental health issues so I\u2019m being kind in my comments. But he needs to grow tf up.", "There are a lot  (A LOT) of Christians who do not believe Catholics are Christian."]}
