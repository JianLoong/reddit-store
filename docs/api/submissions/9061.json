You\u2019re spooky.", "I can understand why you are frustrated, you are 17 and havent really finished growing up yet. Im sure that theres been a lot this year that has messed with you and that theres been a lot of change. You lack context to your sisters experience and thats ok, you are meant to make mistakes at this age, its half the fun of being a new adult.\n\nYour sister had to make a series of big, adult, hard choices, she had to make them alone.. because the other parent of her child refused to be involved.. she didnt have that option, she had to make choices that women 10, 20 years senior struggle with. \n\nHaving access to abortion doesnt mean you have to use it, thats what choice is, your sister didnt want/feel comfortable/believe that abortion was something she could do. Abortion can seem a Logical Choice, but it isnt always, your sister is the only one who could determine is she would get an abortion, and punishing her for her choice is wrong and frankly cruel of you. \n\nYou sister then had to choose between keeping her child, or giving them up.. how do you think that felt? She had to choose between two impossible options, im sure she felt that she was choosing between her future or the childs, can you imagine the guilt and relief she might feel at choosing adoption, the regret and loss from saying goodbye to a child that sat underneath her heart for 10 months? \n\nAfter all of that, she comes home, her body has changed, and is continuing to change.. her body knows it should have a child and her emotions and self are lost in a sea of hormones and impulses and probably pain as she heals and she reaches out to lean on you..\n\nYouve probably had to bear more than is fair for your sister, shes probably trusted you to carry her forward and absord her emotions without really thinking about it. And that is not fair, but young one, Life isnt fair. Sometimes you need to be the one who takes on the burdens of others until they can stand on their own again. Thats what love is. \n\nSo for your question i am going to say ESH, your parents should have made sure their children had access to mental health support as you navigated this challenge. You know you were unkind, even without context you know you were an ass. Go apologise and talk to your sister about how you feel instead of just dumping on her in frustration.

All you had to say was that you were incapable of helping her through her feelings of being traumatized and that she should seek out someone else, probably a professional, to work through these feelings. You didn\u2019t have to invalidate her trauma especially when it\u2019s something you will literally never experience and never have to know.", "Yta, nothing you described was my birth experience.  I cant imagine going in thinking what happened to your sister was a normal expected part of pregnancy.  That sounds incredibly traumatising and she needs help.

Unplanned pregnancy sucks immensely, I'd argue it sucks more the younger it happens. This whole situation sucks, and despite my rating I think everyone here is reacting to this in the only way they can really process it. Including you. But it definitely was an asshole move to tell her you don't feel bad about her situation. You absolutely can feel fed up with the situation, and other commenters are right that your sister needs therapy. It's still callous to be saying \"she shouldn't be whining\". This is a great situation for the old adage of 'if you have nothing nice to say, say nothing'. Tell her you're not comfortable talking about the situation, encourage her to bring this to a therapist and absolutely maintain your boundaries even if your parents try to tell you to talk to her b/c her mental health can't come at the cost of yours. But you don't need to inflict additional pain in what's very possibly going to be the worst time in her life.", "YTA: not because she should be using you as a therapist but because you didn't act with empathy.

That you wish her well and hope she finds someone who can help her accept what happened.  Its also ok to gently remind her if she asks again and suggest she seek out a therapist to help her process it.  \n\n\nIt's not ok to tell her you don't care and its her fault.

As someone with a sister I can't imagine speaking to her that way. I get not wanting to be her therapist, but you could have definitely recommended she gets a real therapist. You ask what maybe you should have said so let me help you \"sis I'm glad you're comfortable opening up to me about this, but it's above my abilities to handle.

Tbh it\u2019s easy for you to have an opinion on this because you weren\u2019t the one who went through it. You\u2019re on the outside looking in. I find it hard to believe that you could be so callous to someone you shared a womb with for 9 months.

You're informed you need surgery, and you agree. During the surgery though, the medication in the anesthesia that keeps you from feeling pain wears off but the paralytic wears off so the surgeons have no idea that you're in pain and that you need more of whatever medication prevents you from feeling pain. So you're rightfully traumatized by the entire thing, and you tell your sister about how the event was traumatizing when you're upset and telling her how much it hurt, but instead of being sympathetic, she tells you she doesn't give a s**t since it was your call to go for the hike and that you shouldn't be whining about something that you did.

The chemical bonds and hormones alone are overwhelming and all encompassing, and it\u2019s not something that anyone can properly prepare a fully grown adult for, so the assumption that being \u201cold enough\u201d at 16 when she can\u2019t do ANYTHING ELSE except give birth without someone else\u2019s help is a big leap. \n\nYou are correct though, brother is not her therapist. She needs to speak to a professional for sure. Brother could have the least bit of empathy, though.", "16 is under the legal age limit for sex for a reason.

Maybe no one wants to listen to you cry either.", "She didn't choose to have a difficult birth, hun. It's been, what, two months? Tell your parents she needs therapy if you are tired, but she went through something so scary; have some compassion.", "She made a choice to have sex, presumably. \n\nSo that means she should not complain about emergency c-section *that she could feel*?? Get a grip dude.", "I hope life goes well for you! It would be a shame if you needed emotional support in the future.", "She\u2019s just been through one of the worst things that can happen to a person.

Try being a human being.", "No, you don\u2019t. \n\nYou don\u2019t care about her, so own it. \n\nPeople who care about their sibling also care if that sibling has to go through health complications and major surgery without any anesthetic. Put yourself in her shoes. Imagine you need abdominal surgery. The anesthetic doesn\u2019t work. They cut into you anyway while you scream in agony. Then no one, not even your twin sibling, gives half a shit about it. \n\nYTA.", "Never ask her for help ever in your life. Never expect anything from her except a shallow relationship. She\u2019ll probably always remember this moment. She\u2019s in pain, emotionally, physically, mentally. She needs support from people who care about her, she needs intensive therapy.

Even if you don't agree with her choices you can at least be empathetic or say \"I think you should talk to a professional because I can't help you - let's go talk to mom and dad about it.\" She felt herself being cut open Imagine feeling a scalpel cutting through your skin and feeling your muscles moved and your insides pulled out. Imagine having surgery on your penis or balls and *you can feel the doctor cutting you open and feel them moving stuff around*. Her choices have nothing to do with the fact that having surgery and feeling everything is a super fucking traumatic experience for anyone. There are cases where people have straight up killed themselves after having surgery where they felt everything.\n\n\n Even if you're sitting there thinking how she made those choices you can make a conscious effort for your twin to be supportive or try to find a way to support her the best you can in a way that you feel comfortable. Take the fact that she had a baby out of it; if she had, had her gallbladder removed or her appendix removed or any other major abdominal surgery and felt everything would you be supportive and more understanding? If the answer is yes then you need to find the best way to support and help her.

She has parents.", "While sure, they can give all the advice they want - it\u2019s still her decision at the end of the day. She made the choice she was comfortable with.

He literally looked at me and said \u201cyou made the choice to have sex, you should be the one to pay the price instead of pawning it off on other people\u201d. Last words we ever spoke. I refused to even be in the same house as him after. And I was quite glad when I\u2019d heard he\u2019d passed.", "It\u2019s not the sex part, it\u2019s the warnings of the parents on what might follow and her stubborn determination to go through with it anyway.

Get off your high horse", "Ok so let\u2019s assume she used protection. The guy ran away as soon as it happened, she chose to stay the course. The parents told her in detail how hard this was going to be and she stayed the course. Pregnancies are risky, they can be lethal - sister stayed her course. But when the consequences come knocking exactly as predicted it\u2019s who-could-have-seen-this-coming-trauma that needs to be dumped on the brother? I still say NTA.", "No, they don\u2019t deserve to suffer, they should have an abortion and chalk it up to lesson learned and move on. The fact that she chose to suffer is her mistake, not the sex. Sure, it\u2019s her life, she can do whatever she wants, but the suffering is self-inflicted. It\u2019s also why the brother is angry.", "Not at all, what bothers me is the determination to refuse abortion despite complications early on and the obvious way the father hightailed.

OP's post makes me feel gross.", "Says the people that are on AITA lol y\u2019all are so childish like you wouldn\u2019t act the same as a 17 year old, fuck off.

It's been ONE month since she had her traumatic medical experience.", "God you\u2019re an asshole", "I'd argue he's an asshole for acting and saying she shouldn't be hurt or traumatized by it, but not an asshole for getting tired of being used as a personal therapist. Her family should get her into therapy though.", "Cool, I was just confused because I saw someone else say the same thing.", "There are problems that require more support than just talking to family. If it was school or friends, yeah talking to her twin brother would be okay because he could relate and had a better understanding on how to react to those problems. But going through a traumatic birth (one that most likely could have killed her), and then giving up her baby for adoption, she needs a professional therapist that is better equipped to talk and understand her emotions than her brother.", "Right, a choice. She chose not to abort. So she deserves to suffer?", "Who\u2019s to say abortion would have been any easier? Seems like this is coming from someone who\u2019s never had to make this choice.", "So youre saying she deserves it.", "I don\u2019t understand why so many people (usually men) practically hate pregnant women.

So sorry that happened to you.", "Well gee, I suppose next time you\u2019re in a car, if you get into an accident, you should hold yourself responsible if you need major surgery and you get inadequate pain relief, and it takes you a while to recover. Cause you know, you were warned people get into car accidents. \n\nGood grief the level of hatred people have for pregnant women is something else.", "Well fuck everybody who goes through something difficult I guess", "Shes not dumping her understandable and undeserved trauma on him. Shes reaching out to her twin brother for support. Supposedly siblings are supposed to love and care about eachother?", "I wouldn't act the same as a 17yr old, most people already have developed empathy at that age , also what do you mean any other aita post? , if the posts are different obviously the response would be different as well", "Right. She\u2019s not even considered physically \u201chealed\u201d for 4 more weeks!", "Not at all, I merely stated that the brother is NTA for finally snapping and not having the emotional bandwith to deal with this.", "Well her brother is only human and reached his limits. He\u2019s angry because she put herself in this position and he\u2019s angry because he loves her. And he too is 17. So everyone here who keeps saying her mistakes and behavior should be forgiven because she\u2019s practically a child needs to remember that her brother is also a child and not equipped for this kind of emotional dumping.", "I agree. But op isnt saying that to her. Hes saying she deserved it and that he doesnt care. Hes frustrated and upset because his sister was hurt and it could have been easily avoided. But it wasnt. And thats his problem and everyone commenting shit like you need to get over\n\n\n\"She shoulda, she coulda\" ok but she didnt. Oh well. You cant go back and change it. You can either be there and support the people you claim to love or admit that its too much for you to care about people when they make the *human* mistake of fucking up.", "No he\u2019s angry because she burdens him with this experience for months now and continues to do so. You\u2019re right, she\u2019s doing this because she\u2019s his sister and he\u2019s all she has, but he\u2019s also right because he is incapable of going through this emotional trauma and it irks him to be pulled into it despite having played no part in it. Not everyone has the emotional bandwith of being a support crutch for 9 months, he clearly has reached his limits. Honestly I try to imagine a scenario where I had to go through this with a sibling for almost a year, it would have completely depleted me and made me snap, too - especially when it was self-inflicted.", "He didn't indicate that she *deserved* it. Just that he's over it and can't listen to it anymore. We only know a fraction of the actual story. I know my sympathy can only go so far and when someone drones on and on and on and on it can get old.\n\nI don't think she should have suffered obviously. But it's not her brothers responsibility to help her with the trauma that the whole family warned her about.\n\nShe made a bad choice. And that sucks, especially having to feel all the pain with no minimal pain killers. But if brother has had enough he has the right to say so. \n\nGonna go with NTA", "From the post, she's only been offloading onto him since the birth? Which was a month ago.  \n\n\nI mean, sure, her offloading would get annoying, but I'm not reading it like he was a support crutch for 9 months?", "Great point, thanks for making me think about it from that perspective. I think op cares a lot but he needs a break for sure. He shouldnt have talked to his sister like that but it sounds like he needs a good while without anyone needing him for anything. You cant get blood from a stone. Im irritated by a lot of shit my little brother does but we dont live together anymore so its easier to give him grace.", "That\u2019s the way I read it, given the backstory provided although I agree that this would be my interpretation."]}
