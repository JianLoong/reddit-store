Giving it to your sister implies you liked it but it didn't fit you..like you would give your sister a shirt and say\" hey here's an ugly shirt..you should wear it!\"", "NTA\n\nOnce she handed it to you, it was yours meaning you could do whatever you wanted with it like regift it. Honestly, if I was your MIL, I would be happier knowing that someone was getting use out of the top I wasn't able to return or exchange rather than it being thrown away.", "NTA.\n\nWhen you give a gift, you give away all rights to that item. MIL sounds like a controlling person if she thinks she can control what you do with a short she gave to you.", "NTA. Once given, the recipient has total say over what happens to a gift. It\u2019s not like she *loaned* you the shirt.", "NTA. Once you give something as a gift you no longer have any claim to it or any say it what happens to it since it is not yours.", "Why would your MIL even know about this?  Was this some \"special\" shirt you were given for this specific event? \n\nNAH. I think the situation is odd but she said it's not a big deal so don't make it into one.", "NTA. It didn't fit you so you gave it to someone else who could wear it, that's better than going into the trash. Plus it's a gift she has no say what you do with a gift.", "NTA", "NTA.", "NAH it was a gift if you wanted to turn it into confetti you can but maybe you could have told her instead of her having to ask", "NTA.

You expressed gratitude. You gave it to someone you care about, who will enjoy it, showing you did indeed consider the shirt to be a valuable gift. Totally NTA!

Your MIL doesn't get to force you to keep a gift that she has no rights to. Glad you could make sure the shirt is being put to good use by giving it to your sister.", "NTA.", "Why would she assume that you would wear the shirt at the dinner?  it seems really odd to presume something like that.", "It's traditional in my family to put gift receipts in with any clothes given (for christmas/birthdays/etc.) in case they don't fit, person doesn't like the material/color. It doesn't matter to me if something I thought might look good isn't to their taste.", "NAH. \n\nI feel like it\u2019s reasonable that, given it doesn\u2019t fit, you would want to find someone else for whom it DOES fit that will enjoy it. Especially your sister, which keeps it in the family.\n\nI also feel like it\u2019s reasonable for MIL to be a bit saddened by it. She\u2019s probably blaming herself for buying the wrong size, but can\u2019t convey that fact to others.\n\nSince MIL wants to drop it, I\u2019d let it go. Just a small bump in the road.", "NTA", "NTA!\n\nNext time she gives you any kind of gift give it back to her straight away still wrapped. When she tries to get mad tell her that you ONLY accept gifts that are actual gifts. Once something is given to a person it is theirs to do with as they choose. As she doesn\u2019t believe that then you\u2019re not comfortable accepting things from her.", "Your MIL is leading a charmed life if this is her biggest concern. A gift is a gift, and whatever the recipient does with said gift is their business.  NTA.", "NTA, It was your shirt and you did not need permission to give it away. At least it is still in the family. :)", "NTA you are her dil not her dolly to dress up.", "I obviously read too much JUSTNOMIL but do you think there is a chance that MIL bought it too small on purpose? And then she wanted you to wear a too small shirt to see her? It's just weird that she is so insistent. NTA", "NTA \n\nShe literally thought that you have to wear the shirt she gave you to a meal with her. That's some serious entitlement.", "Nta.  Some people just aren't happy unless they are causing drama.", "NTA. \n\nI can see both sides. It\u2019s a gift, it\u2019s yours to do with. If you wanted to cut it up & throw it away, you could. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for your MIL to hang onto being upset, but if I were to give someone a gift and found they gave it to someone else soon after, I would be upset & annoyed for a couple minutes. Then I would move on because it was a gift, and trust they are telling me the truth.", "MIL already made it into a big deal.", "NTA. Does she think she has tracking rights on gifts she bestows? Besides, you gave it to your sister, hardly a random stranger. \u201cShe said to tell you \u2018thank you\u2019. She really loves that shirt. It was so thoughtful of you to get it for us.\u201d You should even get your sister to send a thank you note. That would be delicious.", "A gift, once given, is no longer yours. NTA", "Every year when we get home from Christmas with my in-laws, half the items go directly in the Donation pile.  It's now my stuff and I can decide what to do with it, including donation.", "Plot twist: MIL painstakingly sewed an Airtag in the shirt to track OP and is mad her devious scheme isn't working!  /s", "Same in my family, especially for clothes!\n\nIt's so hard to know how something's going to look on you without trying it on first. Even with a plain old t-shirt you can't always assume it'll fit the way you expect it to.\n\nObviously OP didn't get the chance to try it on until after the fact. Unless MIL's some kind of space alien she had to know there was a chance it wouldn't work out.", "NTA. And who on Earth would she expect you to be wearing it to dinner? You probably have other clothes too. She can't predict what you're going to wear.  What if another outfit were more appropriate for the event or even the weather. She was fishing for your gratitude and making herself the center of attention.\n\nShe gave you a gift. You own it. You don't need permission to give it away.", "NTA. If it is yours then you can do what you want with it. If you mistreated the item (I used it to mop up some motor oil then clean my dog's muddy paws) you might be an asshole but you gave it to someone who could use it.", "NTA\n\nOnce it hit your hands it became yours and you are allowed to do with it what you want.", "NTA..this was my Mothers trick, always give gifts that have an invisible string attached as if she would always have a say in what is done with the gift. I finally started responding to all the \u201cwhere is (insert gift from Xmas 6 yrs ago here), with \u201c I threw that trash out the second you turned your back Mom, LOVE YOU!\u201d Mom eventually stopped doing this to me, but did it to my Sisters until she died.", "NTA. Just the fact that she asked you why you weren't wearing the shirt she'd given you was rude.", "NTA\n\nI get where your MIL is coming from, it would hurt to know something you gave to someone was then given to someone else - especially if only a recently gifted item.\n\nSaying that, being basically told you\u2019re a liar and you just hated it isn\u2019t the correct response. She was hurt certainly, but that makes her the AH.", "NTA.  A gift, once given, belongs to the recipient.  MIL gets no say in how it's used or given away.", "What are you losing?  Keep her off balance.", "Same thing happened here. I had a shirt I LOVED but it got holes in it. I was going to fix it but MIL insisted she fix it because \"it's her love language\". \n\nOk. Instead of fixing it she threw it out and bought a new shift that didn't look remotely close to it. Only thing it had in common was that it was navy blue. The shirt I had was tight at the top and baggy/flowy in the abdomen. That was important to me. New shirt was baggy to the point I couldn't wear a bra without it being the main shirt and then it tied up over the stomach and was short. I have a stomach that sticks out so it looked like a broken balloon on me. Like it was trying to highlight my insecurities. \n\nMonth after she bought it and I had never worn it out, my friend tells me her girlfriends transition is at the point where she feels comfortable enough to start wearing woman's clothes. Her girlfriend hates spending money so we thought we'd surprise her by raiding our closets for clothes we didn't mind parting with. My partner mentioned it to his mom and she pulled a few items from her closet for our friend too. \n\nYes I gave her the new shirt. It was fugly on me and it looks great on my friend. She loves it. \n\nMIL went to my friends work while she wore it and put 2 and 2 together :/", "I probably wouldn\u2019t accept gifts from her again. She sounds controlling and exhausting. NTA by a long shot.", "I mean, I absolutely have given my sister ugly things but told her \u201cit will look good on *you* though\u201d because I am a terrible sister.", "People do have different tastes so if I think it's ugly someone else can like it.\nMom is still crazy.", "The only exception to this would be family heirlooms, and it's more of a moral claim than a legal one.  You can do anything you want with great-grandma's ring, but you really should give it to the next generation, provided the next generation won't sell it for drug money.", "I wish my MIL had understood this. She recently passed away and we discovered that she had saved several gifts we gave her so that they could be returned to us after she passed. If she didn't like/want them, I really would have preferred that she pass them on/donate them.", "lol! I would not be surprised anymore.", "Yeah mil wasn't surprised that she wasn't wearing the shirt. She was surprised that she was even at dinner. The tracking stated otherwise.", "NTA.  A gift has served its purpose the second it is opened.  You do not owe your MIL any explanation or special consideration.", "NTA. but don't give away gifts. Gifts are often considered almost sacred to the gift giver and it really hurts when the recipient discards what they thought were perfect gifts.", "NTA - honestly I don\u2019t think you would ever win in this situation. And as the gift giver has she never heard of vouchers?", "Once a gift is given the person receiving the gift  can do as they like with the gift..MIL can pout all she likes. NTA.", "In what universe this is not YTA. You disrespected your MIL for not telling her first. Don't expect to get anything from her from now on", "I'm wondering if it isn't MIL's size, and was hoping OP would return it to her so she could keep it.", "Same here. No matter how many times we say please less gifts we still end up with a tacky door decoration with a scarecrow saying happy fall or some dumb shit like that", "This is truly, without question, *the most* petty behavior I\u2019ve ever heard of. A secret post-death power play. A long con delivery of emotional insult. A check-mate of passive aggression from her literal grave."]}
