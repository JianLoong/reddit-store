Giving it to your sister implies you liked it but it didn't fit you..like you would give your sister a shirt and say\" hey here's an ugly shirt..you should wear it!\"", "NTA\n\nOnce she handed it to you, it was yours meaning you could do whatever you wanted with it like regift it. Honestly, if I was your MIL, I would be happier knowing that someone was getting use out of the top I wasn't able to return or exchange rather than it being thrown away.", "NTA.\n\nWhen you give a gift, you give away all rights to that item. MIL sounds like a controlling person if she thinks she can control what you do with a short she gave to you.", "NTA. Once given, the recipient has total say over what happens to a gift. It\u2019s not like she *loaned* you the shirt.", "NTA. Once you give something as a gift you no longer have any claim to it or any say it what happens to it since it is not yours.", "Why would your MIL even know about this?  Was this some \"special\" shirt you were given for this specific event? \n\nNAH. I think the situation is odd but she said it's not a big deal so don't make it into one.", "NTA. It didn't fit you so you gave it to someone else who could wear it, that's better than going into the trash. Plus it's a gift she has no say what you do with a gift.", "NTA", "NTA.", "NAH it was a gift if you wanted to turn it into confetti you can but maybe you could have told her instead of her having to ask", "NTA.

You expressed gratitude. You gave it to someone you care about, who will enjoy it, showing you did indeed consider the shirt to be a valuable gift. Totally NTA!

Especially your sister, which keeps it in the family.\n\nI also feel like it\u2019s reasonable for MIL to be a bit saddened by it. She\u2019s probably blaming herself for buying the wrong size, but can\u2019t convey that fact to others.\n\nSince MIL wants to drop it, I\u2019d let it go. Just a small bump in the road.", "NTA", "NTA!\n\nNext time she gives you any kind of gift give it back to her straight away still wrapped. When she tries to get mad tell her that you ONLY accept gifts that are actual gifts. Once something is given to a person it is theirs to do with as they choose.

And then she wanted you to wear a too small shirt to see her? It's just weird that she is so insistent.

Some people just aren't happy unless they are causing drama.", "NTA. \n\nI can see both sides. It\u2019s a gift, it\u2019s yours to do with. If you wanted to cut it up & throw it away, you could. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for your MIL to hang onto being upset, but if I were to give someone a gift and found they gave it to someone else soon after, I would be upset & annoyed for a couple minutes. Then I would move on because it was a gift, and trust they are telling me the truth.", "MIL already made it into a big deal.", "NTA. Does she think she has tracking rights on gifts she bestows? Besides, you gave it to your sister, hardly a random stranger. \u201cShe said to tell you \u2018thank you\u2019. She really loves that shirt. It was so thoughtful of you to get it for us.\u201d You should even get your sister to send a thank you note. That would be delicious.", "A gift, once given, is no longer yours.

Even with a plain old t-shirt you can't always assume it'll fit the way you expect it to.\n\nObviously OP didn't get the chance to try it on until after the fact. Unless MIL's some kind of space alien she had to know there was a chance it wouldn't work out."]}
