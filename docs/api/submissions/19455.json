Some people just aren't happy unless they are causing drama.", "NTA. \n\nI can see both sides. It\u2019s a gift, it\u2019s yours to do with. If you wanted to cut it up & throw it away, you could. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for your MIL to hang onto being upset, but if I were to give someone a gift and found they gave it to someone else soon after, I would be upset & annoyed for a couple minutes. Then I would move on because it was a gift, and trust they are telling me the truth.", "MIL already made it into a big deal.", "NTA. Does she think she has tracking rights on gifts she bestows? Besides, you gave it to your sister, hardly a random stranger. \u201cShe said to tell you \u2018thank you\u2019. She really loves that shirt.

Instead of fixing it she threw it out and bought a new shift that didn't look remotely close to it. Only thing it had in common was that it was navy blue. The shirt I had was tight at the top and baggy/flowy in the abdomen. That was important to me. New shirt was baggy to the point I couldn't wear a bra without it being the main shirt and then it tied up over the stomach and was short. I have a stomach that sticks out so it looked like a broken balloon on me. Like it was trying to highlight my insecurities. \n\nMonth after she bought it and I had never worn it out, my friend tells me her girlfriends transition is at the point where she feels comfortable enough to start wearing woman's clothes. Her girlfriend hates spending money so we thought we'd surprise her by raiding our closets for clothes we didn't mind parting with. My partner mentioned it to his mom and she pulled a few items from her closet for our friend too. \n\nYes I gave her the new shirt. It was fugly on me and it looks great on my friend.

She recently passed away and we discovered that she had saved several gifts we gave her so that they could be returned to us after she passed. If she didn't like/want them, I really would have preferred that she pass them on/donate them.", "lol! I would not be surprised anymore.", "Yeah mil wasn't surprised that she wasn't wearing the shirt. She was surprised that she was even at dinner. The tracking stated otherwise.", "NTA.  A gift has served its purpose the second it is opened.  You do not owe your MIL any explanation or special consideration.", "NTA. but don't give away gifts. Gifts are often considered almost sacred to the gift giver and it really hurts when the recipient discards what they thought were perfect gifts.", "NTA - honestly I don\u2019t think you would ever win in this situation.

A check-mate of passive aggression from her literal grave.", "YTA\n\nA present is supposed to be for the person receiving it, not their siblings. I give a gentle YTA because most people when buying gifts would rather you return the gift for one that you can use rather than just pawn it off to a sibling. She spent time and money on a gift she wanted you to appreciate, and instead you gave it to your sister without a second thought. She feels miffed, and rightfully so, in my opinion, because you treated the gift like it was just another object of yours, rather than as a treasured gift from an in-law. That's why she accused you of not liking it.", "NTA. Pretty simple. She gifted it to you and you can decide what to do with it", "NTA -  I can't believe how many Reddit posters deal with this situation!

You're free to do what you want with it. I kinda understand your MIL. If you get along with this lady  I would just assume that she tried really hard to get you something you liked and probably has hurt feelings. If someone nonchalantly told me they gave away my gift that I gave them I would be pretty down too. This is giving her the benefit of the doubt that she actually likes you though", "Info\n\nHas your mil ever made comments about your weight? I only ask because if so maybe she purposely bought the shirt small in an attempt to force you into losing weight to fit in it. I could be wrong but im curious. \n\nRegardless of the answer you're still NTA", "NTA\n\nShe's going to view this and react to it however she does. Be at peace that you did nothing wrong. And just tuck away this bit of insight into your MIL.\n\nIt would be interesting to know how your husband views his mom's behavior.", "YTA, but for different reasons. OP needs mother in law training! First of all you have praise MIL for the wonderful gift, second of all show it off, in this case if it doesn\u2019t fit properly- OP should ask for advise after wearing it. If it doesn\u2019t fit at all then fucking hide it forever or make it disappear and never mention it.

Ah - the strings attached gifts. I know all about those types of things. My MIL wanted my husband and I to 'keep' her mother's couch (it's ugly and like sitting on a brick) but not only that, she didn't want to store them in my sister's garage so we had to pay for a storage shed until we moved into our new house (six months). Not quite the same thing but it's not a gift. It's something she wants you to have because she doesn't want it but also doesn't want to get rid of it. The shirt thing is strange though. Maybe she bought it because SHE liked it and thought if you didn't want to keep it she should've been given first dibs. Odd.", "I just wanna say that I would, 100%, hand my sister a shirt and say \"here's an ugly shirt...you should wear it\". OP is NTA, but that I feel like the interaction you described is on par for sisters.", "This is why I lobbied hard and long to eliminate holiday gift exchanges.  Oh the bags of pure crap we would bring home.  And those bags would sit around for weeks or months coz I couldn't bring myself to deal with it.", "Yikes. This is why we don't buy clothes for other adults. You never need to apologize for passing along clothing that is too small. Especially since it was given without a gift receipt. NTA", "NTA. She not only expected you to wear it to dinner but confronted you because you didn't? I don't even know how to interpret that but it's definitely not right for several reasons.", "My sister has given me gifts and demanded them back literally years later. I don't accept anything from her anymore.", "My mom does this. On my birthday, in March, she gave me two dresses. I had been telling her for months that I hate wearing dresses and had bought some dress pants and dress shirts. She didn\u2019t want me to exchange the items. Ultimately my dad said he\u2019d take me to exchange them and my mom was pissed. The joys of still living with your parents in your 30\u2019s on disability.", "Agreed. I can see her hoping you did, that's in the realm of normal behavior. But:\n\n1. Expecting \n\n2. Being surprised and disappointed \n\n3. Confronting \n\n4. Calling names (liar)\n\nThose are all *absolutely* odd. I have to wonder if she said this in front of other people or took OP off to the side. How did this bizarre interaction go down?", "She bought the wrong size, what was OP supposed to do with a too small shirt? On top of that what is OP supposed to do with a too small shirt that presumably won't be offensive to MIL?", "This was where my mind went as well. Did she want to see OP stuffed into a too small top and uncomfortable at dinner?  Or let her know what size she feels she should be?", "Not every gift is treasured. She tried it, it didn't fit, she gave it away as ashe had every right to do. No one in their right mind expects everyone to keep every single thing they are given as a gift. What was she supposed to do, leave it in her closet for the rest of her life?", "If OP isn't \"allowed\" to give away a shirt that doesn't fit what is she supposed to do with it?", "I am not saying she was in the right, I am saying I get where she is coming from. She didn\u2019t handle it well, as I mentioned, making her the AH. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that she was obviously hurt and I get that.", "Tell her MIL it\u2019s too small, and ask for the receipt so she can get it in her size. It doesn\u2019t have to be treasured, but some semblance of gratitude is usually decorum when receiving gifts from family members. MIL was miffed because her gift was rudely given away.", "NTA. If I was MIL, my reaction would have been to ask if I can replace it with a different size or something similar. Clothes can be a tricky gift though so I\u2019d have avoided it in the first place..", "Buy her a shirt too small as a gift. Next time you see her ask her why she isn\u2019t wearing it.", "oh is this the alexa story again?", "I have read about people in your position who leave the items at their in law's house.  \"Oops.  I forgot to put it in the car.\"", "This is the weird thing, she wasn't a petty person. I think she just thought it was the right thing to do. I just don't get it. There's also a box of all the birthday/Christmas/mother's day cards my husband gave her over the years, as well as things like the invitation to our wedding. Why would he want those? You keep those for your own sentimental reasons, but they're not really sentimental to him.", "NTA. Once something has been gifted to you, it is your property. There is no need to tell anyone what you intend to do with it, nor to seek permission. MIL is being a weirdo. Also, why would she buy you something in the wrong size? Do people not verify sizing before a purchase?"]}
