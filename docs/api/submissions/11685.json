Victoria is notoriously indecisive. Sometimes it can be avoided, others not much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe last big point of contention was 5 years ago, when she got married. People took off work, booked flights, etc...all for her to change her mind just months before the wedding. Both times, there was no emergency or reason to change the date. She just found a better venue and it was still early enough to get deposits back on the original, so she did it. Of course, people were upset. And once again, a lot of people couldn't come to the new date. A few of us tried to tell her to manage her expectations. Victoria just kept saying it was her special day, she could do with it what she wanted. And what's worse is, two friends in our group supported this behavior.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe've had some minor issues where we'll start planning group trips, only for her to back out or want to change everything. We never lose money, but it's still annoying. And still, we resolved this by basically planning everything and telling her where to show up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCut to the next time that's not possible, this year. Victoria is pregnant with her first kid. She helped plan the shower and picked the venue (a friend's house), date, etc. This time we triple checked that this is what she wanted. She said yes. The shower is supposed to be in 2 weeks. Then...she changed her mind. She wanted to change the venue and the date. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce again, several people can't come. And this time, I'm included. My husband and I have an anniversary trip planned. Non-refundable tickets and resort accommodations. We're also going to be somewhere that doesn't allow technology.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVictoria asked me to reschedule and I said I can't, I'm sorry, but I'll send a gift. She got really upset and said she wanted me there. I sympathized but said I had this trip planned for over a year. She then mentioned how many other people can't come. I pointed out maybe it's a sign to keep the shower on the same date, same venue, etc. Especially as our friend is still willing to host. Victoria tried to pull the same old \"it's my special day, you only get one baby shower, etc\". I got fed up and told her that she is well within her rights to change the date, but that it is inconsiderate to constantly do this last minute. I pointed out while she's free to do what she wants, she has to stop getting mad at others for having lives and not dropping everything for her. Victoria began to cry and hung up.\n\nOur friend group is divided. Some think I should've just let her be upset, she'd get over it in time. That it wasn't the place to bring up my issue with her indecisive nature. Others have told me that I did the right thing.

I don\u2019t have \u201cfavorite\u201d things but there\u2019s more of a spectrum of equality involved in that. Rarely do I utilize binary thinking with dilemmas in my life. We don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a neurological issue or a personality quirk or what\u2019s up but it\u2019s obvious to me that the majority of folks aren\u2019t doing this type of thinking to this extent. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I can even help it and eventually decided I didn\u2019t need to.\n\nI came to this epiphany when I experienced someone like Victoria here that was obnoxiously correlating our behaviors together w \u201ctwin flame\u201d vibes attached. They liked me so much because they saw themselves in me but this was far from reciprocal. She was also extremely materialistic and I\u2019m nowhere near this. It was almost like a weird gaslighting thing and rly creeped me out.\n\nI eventually got upset enough to put her on blast because she was an extremely entitled and selfish person that was not reading social queues or body language and her comparisons became insulting. \n\nMaybe she had a similar condition or personality or whatevs but the huge difference is that I don\u2019t use my quirks as an excuse or weapon to inconvenience, harm, exclude, or claim superiority to others and especially not on a regular basis as a go-to. I probably did as a teen more-so but trial and error should likely be done by this stage in life.\n\nMost folk can grasp that they need to compromise with the rest of society rather than beat their own drum and change goal posts for no reason but preference. \n\nThe only thing that got through to this person was giving them a taste of their own medicine AND pointing out that their reaction to said proverbial meds is not UNLIKE everyone\u2019s reaction to them on a regular basis. \n\nMight be somewhat different that this is a friend that you can tolerate and find some endearing qualities but it\u2019s possibly time to maybe parse those out and compare if it\u2019s worth the toil or effort. \n\nPeeps change and sometimes it\u2019s for the worse and the history displayed sounds exhausting and almost a precursor to a major incident where it\u2019s not just a quirk and it\u2019s a safety issue or some other wild negligence. Hopefully not but in my experience it fits the bill. Good luck", "NTA\n\nShe needed to hear that\n\nAnd she needs to keep hearing that", "This isn't about her being indecisive. This is about her changing her mind. That's two different things.\n\nShe makes a decision. Then she decides- no, I've found yet a better thing and I don't care if my decision negatively impacts other people.\n\nThat's not being indecisive. And you're right, she can't get made when she changes her mind and her new decision means people aren't available. That's life.\n\nIt's also nice of you to point this out now cuz if 5-7 years, she's going to be doing this with her child's birthday parties and her kid is going to be wondering when half their friends aren't showing up without understanding that mom changed the date and the location the week before the party so the parents couldn't bring their kids anymore. Maybe she'll learn now. (Probably not. But maybe.)\n\nNTA", "NTA.  She is allowed to change her plans and others are allowed to say that doesn't work for them.

HOWEVER, the rest of us also have our own special days, that we can do with as we please. Don't expect the world to pay homage to your special day and not give similar respect our special days.\n* Again, you can do whatever you want with your special day, but\n\n1. When you are depending upon others to help plan and execute the things you would like to do on your special day, then you also have to work with in their constraints and willingness. They are gifting you their time and efforts; they do not owe you anything and everything you decide you want whenever you want it.\n2. When you are asking others to come share in and celebrate your special day, you have to respect that they are going to the trouble of reserving that time, making arrangements, and spending money toward doing so. If you ask and they do so and THEN you decide to toss at all that they've done to help you celebrate; then (1) you are being incredibly rude and disrespectful of these celebrants and their efforts AND (2) you cannot expect them to make a second effort for your latest whim.\n\n* OK, so your excuse for your wedding and your shower is those are your special days. What is your excuse for all the other times you change your mind at the last minute, for no special reason?\n\nQuestion for some of your friends...

We felt like we\u2019re were presenting a work project to a critical yet unhelpful manager. I told her that in the interest of keeping the friendship; we would never be planning a trip together again.

She's upset because she can't have everything her way. Tell her she gets one more chance, then stop being friends with her if she breaks that chance.\n\nI want to be understanding, but it also pisses me off royally that she makes her indecisive nature everyone else's problem.

I don't know why it's always so surprising to me when people are so selfish and self-centered, but it is. The fact that she just expects everyone to drop everything and accommodate her every time stuff like this happens is just mind-boggling. I'm glad you said something to her. It kinda sucks that it had to be while she's pregnant and probably a little emotional/hormonal because of that, but it needed to be done. Honestly, people should have said something to her sooner. I could not be friends with someone like that, so kudos to you for hanging in there this long.", "She\u2018s a manupulative ass.

Victoria began to cry and hung up.\"\n\nIn the grand scheme of things NTA; I have typed out a possibility for an alternative way to approach the situation. \n\nHow specific would you like the feedback to be? Telling someone to 'stop getting mad' can be interpretted as invalidating their feelings. A different way to handle the situation could be; acknowledge that she's within her rights to change the date and that others are similarly well within their rights to not attend the baby shower. Then she's well within her rights to get mad at others for not attending. Then she has a coice as to how she expresses that anger and who she expresses it to. As long as she knows they may not react favourably if they feel like they're being attacked for simply expressing their side of the situation I.E. \"We've booked this holiday over a year ago and it would be very expensive for us to cancel this late. We cannot afford that and would prefer to go on our holiday.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA lot more nuance than that of course but I hope you get the drift.\n\nEveryeone has a right to express themselves, disagree with each other, and decide whether they want to attend an event or not.
