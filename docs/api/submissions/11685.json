Victoria is notoriously indecisive. Sometimes it can be avoided, others not much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe last big point of contention was 5 years ago, when she got married. People took off work, booked flights, etc...all for her to change her mind just months before the wedding. Both times, there was no emergency or reason to change the date. She just found a better venue and it was still early enough to get deposits back on the original, so she did it. Of course, people were upset. And once again, a lot of people couldn't come to the new date. A few of us tried to tell her to manage her expectations. Victoria just kept saying it was her special day, she could do with it what she wanted. And what's worse is, two friends in our group supported this behavior.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe've had some minor issues where we'll start planning group trips, only for her to back out or want to change everything. We never lose money, but it's still annoying. And still, we resolved this by basically planning everything and telling her where to show up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCut to the next time that's not possible, this year. Victoria is pregnant with her first kid. She helped plan the shower and picked the venue (a friend's house), date, etc. This time we triple checked that this is what she wanted. She said yes. The shower is supposed to be in 2 weeks. Then...she changed her mind. She wanted to change the venue and the date. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce again, several people can't come. And this time, I'm included. My husband and I have an anniversary trip planned. Non-refundable tickets and resort accommodations. We're also going to be somewhere that doesn't allow technology.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVictoria asked me to reschedule and I said I can't, I'm sorry, but I'll send a gift. She got really upset and said she wanted me there. I sympathized but said I had this trip planned for over a year. She then mentioned how many other people can't come. I pointed out maybe it's a sign to keep the shower on the same date, same venue, etc. Especially as our friend is still willing to host. Victoria tried to pull the same old \"it's my special day, you only get one baby shower, etc\". I got fed up and told her that she is well within her rights to change the date, but that it is inconsiderate to constantly do this last minute. I pointed out while she's free to do what she wants, she has to stop getting mad at others for having lives and not dropping everything for her. Victoria began to cry and hung up.\n\nOur friend group is divided. Some think I should've just let her be upset, she'd get over it in time. That it wasn't the place to bring up my issue with her indecisive nature. Others have told me that I did the right thing.

I don\u2019t have \u201cfavorite\u201d things but there\u2019s more of a spectrum of equality involved in that. Rarely do I utilize binary thinking with dilemmas in my life. We don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a neurological issue or a personality quirk or what\u2019s up but it\u2019s obvious to me that the majority of folks aren\u2019t doing this type of thinking to this extent. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I can even help it and eventually decided I didn\u2019t need to.\n\nI came to this epiphany when I experienced someone like Victoria here that was obnoxiously correlating our behaviors together w \u201ctwin flame\u201d vibes attached. They liked me so much because they saw themselves in me but this was far from reciprocal. She was also extremely materialistic and I\u2019m nowhere near this. It was almost like a weird gaslighting thing and rly creeped me out.\n\nI eventually got upset enough to put her on blast because she was an extremely entitled and selfish person that was not reading social queues or body language and her comparisons became insulting. \n\nMaybe she had a similar condition or personality or whatevs but the huge difference is that I don\u2019t use my quirks as an excuse or weapon to inconvenience, harm, exclude, or claim superiority to others and especially not on a regular basis as a go-to. I probably did as a teen more-so but trial and error should likely be done by this stage in life.\n\nMost folk can grasp that they need to compromise with the rest of society rather than beat their own drum and change goal posts for no reason but preference. \n\nThe only thing that got through to this person was giving them a taste of their own medicine AND pointing out that their reaction to said proverbial meds is not UNLIKE everyone\u2019s reaction to them on a regular basis. \n\nMight be somewhat different that this is a friend that you can tolerate and find some endearing qualities but it\u2019s possibly time to maybe parse those out and compare if it\u2019s worth the toil or effort. \n\nPeeps change and sometimes it\u2019s for the worse and the history displayed sounds exhausting and almost a precursor to a major incident where it\u2019s not just a quirk and it\u2019s a safety issue or some other wild negligence. Hopefully not but in my experience it fits the bill. Good luck", "NTA\n\nShe needed to hear that\n\nAnd she needs to keep hearing that", "This isn't about her being indecisive. This is about her changing her mind. That's two different things.\n\nShe makes a decision. Then she decides- no, I've found yet a better thing and I don't care if my decision negatively impacts other people.\n\nThat's not being indecisive. And you're right, she can't get made when she changes her mind and her new decision means people aren't available. That's life.\n\nIt's also nice of you to point this out now cuz if 5-7 years, she's going to be doing this with her child's birthday parties and her kid is going to be wondering when half their friends aren't showing up without understanding that mom changed the date and the location the week before the party so the parents couldn't bring their kids anymore. Maybe she'll learn now. (Probably not. But maybe.)\n\nNTA", "NTA.  She is allowed to change her plans and others are allowed to say that doesn't work for them.

HOWEVER, the rest of us also have our own special days, that we can do with as we please. Don't expect the world to pay homage to your special day and not give similar respect our special days.\n* Again, you can do whatever you want with your special day, but\n\n1. When you are depending upon others to help plan and execute the things you would like to do on your special day, then you also have to work with in their constraints and willingness. They are gifting you their time and efforts; they do not owe you anything and everything you decide you want whenever you want it.\n2. When you are asking others to come share in and celebrate your special day, you have to respect that they are going to the trouble of reserving that time, making arrangements, and spending money toward doing so. If you ask and they do so and THEN you decide to toss at all that they've done to help you celebrate; then (1) you are being incredibly rude and disrespectful of these celebrants and their efforts AND (2) you cannot expect them to make a second effort for your latest whim.\n\n* OK, so your excuse for your wedding and your shower is those are your special days. What is your excuse for all the other times you change your mind at the last minute, for no special reason?\n\nQuestion for some of your friends... When do they believe it IS the right time convey to Victoria how her indecisiveness takes a toll on everyone else and is the reason folks can't/won't accommodate her ever-changing plans?\n\nHope you don't feel guilty in the least. Happy anniversary to you and your husband!", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t even bother with her anymore, I don\u2019t know how you and your friends are still friends with her at this point.", "NTA.  What she is doing is totally inconsiderate.  If I were you, I would never attend any rescheduled event, even if I could.", "NTA. I was the friend who did stuff like this, years ago. It wasn't until some people (that I considered to be close friends) dropped me as a friend because of my behavior that I realized how selfish and self-centered my attitude was.\n\nIf your friend is smart, she'll learn from this and be more aware of how her behavior affects others. If she's stubborn or dumb, you might have to put her friendship in timeout for a while.", "NTA. Never ever change your plans for someone who has a track record of cancelling or rescheduling. That she began to cry and hung up is BS childish behavior. It needed to be said. Maybe it'll give her some insight into why people end up not coming to her events when they finally take place. It's not \"your issue\" with her indecisive nature. It's *her issue* with people not showing up to her rescheduled events.", "NTA. How did this person get so far in life? I'm amazed she still has a husband!", "ESH.\n\nHer for behaving this way, and all of you for enabling it.\n\nYou've been going along with it for five years.  You're allowed to not be friends with people who not only have zero respect for you, but who actively treat you like accessories instead of people, let alone friends.", "Right,  the problem was never going to go away because she has yet to learn what cause & effect mean.", "OP\u2019s friend sounds exhausting and i would\u2019ve distanced myself from a person like that a long time ago. \n\nNTA.", "Can't like this comment enough", "100%  \n\n\nLike, maybe, the 2nd or 3rd she pulled this shit.  \n\n\nOP is NTA.", "Very to the point, exactly what I was thinking of writing almost to the word.", "NTA Victoria sure is ready to defend her right to do what she wants but others' rights to do what they want? \"NO, YOU OWE ME!\"\n\nAnd now for the obligatory joke: Is Victoria by any chance related to a Senegalese moral philosophy professor teaching in Australia?", "Exactly this. She does not seem to be understanding OP's gentle approach so now a taste of her own medicine is in order", "But, but it\u2019s my special day\u2026", "She can and obviously does, she\u2019s surrounded by enablers. Hell, OP was one until recently\n\nTA is 30, she\u2019s not changing, plus she already has her core group trained to enable her so, OP is shitting uphill on this imo", "I love you.\n\nCan you write my speeches?", "Lmao. I would have just said \u201cyes, you\u2019re special day, but not mine, see ya later\u201d too harsh??", "I think she's someone who has no respect for others. People can't drop everything, just so they can accommodate her. If it were me, I would probably do it once, but if it occurs again and again, then I'm out. What I think needs to happen is for everyone to refuse to go out of their way to please her. Including those who can change their plans. It would be a lesson for her that people have lives and things can't always happen as she wants them to. If she's going to change her mind, fine, but she shouldn't be complaining when people can't make it.", "Imagine her children\u2019s lives. Nobody will ever show up to a birthday party", "Yep.", "Or first.", "Upvoted just for the shitting uphill phrase.", "She\u2019s gonna ask her kids to reschedule their birthdays at this rate. Like literally change their birthdays."]}
