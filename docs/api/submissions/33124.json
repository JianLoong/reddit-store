While there there was a kitten that particularly liked me. The grandparents encouraged me to take it home. I was a bit worried at the start as I have an adult cat at home but they kept saying how this kitten loves me and I need to take it home with me. I asked how much they wanted for it and they said nothing and that they want to give away the kittens asap. So I did take the kitten home. \n\nThe next morning I took the kitten to the vet, got him vaccinated and microchipped under my name. But around midday the friend reached out to my sister and said that apparently the kitten was actually wanted by another person (a relative of theirs) who was send some photos of the kittens yesterday and was meant to be a Xmas present for their son. \n\nMy sister gave the friend (who gave me the kitten) my phone number. The friend called me and basically said she is coming over to mine to pick up the kitten. I said no that\u2019s not happening ( I hadn\u2019t spoken with my sister at that point) She then told me that the kitten was actually for an autistic child and that the child is throwing a tantrum because I \u201cruined his Christmas\u201d. I reinstated that I was encouraged to take the kitten home and that it has already been registered under my name paid for vaccinations and put a deposit down for the kitten to get desexed. I asked why cant they pick another kitten since this specific one was taken and the friend said that the family doesn\u2019t like to say no to this child. I said I had to speak to my partner about it and i would let them know. \n\nAt this point i was feeling a bit sad and confused because i felt bad for this child but I also really like the little kitten as well. \n\nI got a text message for the friend\u2019s mum (I think) calling me a bitch and telling me that they are going to lie to the police and tell them that I stole the kitten from the back yard. I answered with \u201cgood luck with that\u201d and blocked the number. \n\nLike I was willing to discuss it further but after calling me names and them saying they will lie to the police pissed me off.\n\nFor any interested the police can\u2019t do anything as it is a civil matter regarding the cat. For the lying the police can do something as I have screenshots of everything proving I didn\u2019t steal the cat and they are lying. \n\nThey now have been harassing my sister and me via texts and phone calls from different numbers. My sister and I just keep ignoring them and blocking the numbers. \n\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1702714576, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18jmov6/aita_for_not_wanting_to_return_the_kitten/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m not unsympathetic to this family, but they aren\u2019t doing the kid any favours.\n\nIn short. If this family wanted the kitten, they should have made it very clear to the kittens former owners. This failure to communicate is not your problem.
