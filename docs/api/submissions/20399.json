I have zero sympathy for your parents, they created this situation, they can deal with it. And what is up with your friends? SO nice of them to offer your parents help, right, since it's so easy and the right thing to do? As if living with someone who STEALS your stuff isn't infuriating and hurtful...wow.", "NTA and definitely don't agree to imprison your sister. Don't be a part of that rights violation. Your sister needs help, but you don't need to be the one to provide it, it needs to be a professional.", "NTA\nYou don\u2019t have an obligation to parent your sister regardless of the context.\nIn addition, this is a disservice to your sister. She needs professional help, not physical and emotional isolation.", "NTA - Do not take responsibility for your sister, this will backfire on you-big time. Without proper counseling/therapy, your sister will not stop. Your parents will blame this on you\u2026you did not monitor her properly in their minds. \n\nTheir lack of parenting should not be your problem. Do not agree to their cockamamie plan.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t even understand what they think this plan would help, apart from her being angry at you instead of them.\n\nShe needs therapy.\n\nMaybe research inpatient facilities that specifically address compulsive theft issues and suggest placing her for a term in there to your parents?", "NTA! You can't help her by imprisoning her, she needs qualified assistance from a trained therapist and possibly medications to help her issue. Kleptomania is an overwhelming urge to steal things. She doesn't have the mental tools to resist the urge and imprisoning her is abuse. If that's their plan, maybe calling CPS might be something to consider?", "Absolutely NTA\nParentification is wrong, especially in a case like this where it's obviously being used to set up the \"responsible\" child for failure along with the avoidance of parental responsibilities.\nYour sister needs help, but it's not on you to change your entire life around to make your parents more comfortable with thier avoidance of the issue", "This is so not, even almost, your problem.\n\nThey should have let her sit her happy ass in jail after she got caught with the jewelry but that ship has sailed. \n\nThey didn't want her to receive legal repercussions, and it is therefore now, their problem. \n\nWhatever they have to do to accomplish that is 100% their responsibility.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I had wondered what sort of assistance they were asking if you and just about died laughing when I saw they wanted you to jail her at your place. Hell no. That's totally ridiculous and also probably not going to work. Just wash your hands of this. There is probably nothing that will work until your sister initiates it now. She is too old to be forced into meaningful therapy now.", "NTA. Your sister needs actual help. Your parents need to provide her with this help. Isolation isn't help; it's an attempt at a temporary solution that will not work. You are not responsible for taking care of someone else's child, especially since Kenzie was already taught by her parents that they will buy her way out of trouble.", "NTA - As you said, you are not a psychologist and she needs one. You are also not her parent.", "NTA   \nYou're not your sisters parent and should have 0 to do with raising/teaching/training her.   \n\n\nStay strong.", "NTA\n\nImprisoning her will not help.\nIt will just make her angry and try to escape.\nYour parents need to get her help for her mental health.  They are responsible for her, you are not.", "NTA - this is probably not going to help her in any way and you don't have to sacrify your time for an issue your parents have refused to see for years. She indeed needs to see a therapist she could really go into huge troubles otherwhise. It's just not your job as a sister to play the therapist during your free time.", "NTA \n\nYour sister doesn't need you what she needs is a professional help.\n\nIf your parents are so ignorant and can't understand what she needs you are in no way bound to look after her. Let ur parents watch her as long as they keep denying the truth.", "NTA\n\nThis is on your parents. Do not let them \"volunteer\" your home, time, and effort to \"fix\" a problem they refused to accept was real.\n\nTheir attitude has negatively impacted your sister. That sucks. It is NOT on you to essentially imprison your sister because your parents are bad at parenting. That won't help anyone.\n\nThey need to take your sister to a psychologist.

The moment she goes back to a normal routine she will be right where she started. A good comparison might be sending an alcoholic to rehab- it's great to be in an alcohol free environment and it will keep you sober, but unless you learn real coping skills while your there, and meet with a counselor or stay in a program when you leave it won't stick.\n\nShe needs a therapist."]}
