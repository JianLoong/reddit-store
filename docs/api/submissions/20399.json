Your parents are responsible for her and they have to find a way to work it out. This is not on you. They\u2019re just trying to shirk their duties onto you because they don\u2019t want to deal with it.  Keep saying no. This is not your problem.", "NTA but your parents sure are AH's.  Your sister desperately needs psychological intervention and they want to shove the problem into your lap.  Stick to your guns and DO NOT let them move her to your place.  Your friends don't know the depth of the problem, and it's not worth trying to educate them.  Just protect yourself.", "If you take on your sister now, your parents will expect you to continue to take her on. They made this mess by not dealing with your sister's issues when they first appeared, now they have to deal with it.  Don't let your parents guilt trip you or threaten to cut you out of the family if you don't help. Stand your ground and make it clear to them that they need to get your sister professional help so that she can live an independent life; you will not be there to clean up her messes when your parents can longer afford to financially, emotionally, or physically. NTA", "NTA. Your parents need to get her in some intensive treatment, not foist her on you. Her problems stem from parental relationships not sibling ones and they need to deal. \n\nLocking her in an empty room may get you charged with imprisonment or endangering. It might be best to back way off until your parents come up with a sane and workable plan.", "She needs an inpatient stay before she steals from the wrong place and gets hurts. You would have to watch her 24/7 and she\u2019s a kid with a serious mental compulsion, not a prisoner. NTA, but your parents need to get their shit straight before she ends up in jail or worse.", "You\u2019re not her jailer. Nor are you her parent / legal guardian. Kenzie is a minor and I could see you getting charged with kidnapping or similar if Kenzie is in lockdown at your place and calls the cops or CPS. Stand your ground. Your parents need to oversee treatment for Kenzie.", "Nta this is unacceptable", "NTA  \nThe main reason is that I don't think you should do tis is because I don't think it would help Kenzie at all. Preventing her from stealing is not tackling the root issue, and you're right, she needs therapy. Your parents are trying to take the easy way out--easy for them, anyway.", "What the parents are proposing is not an approved or effective treatment for kleptomania. Heck, even if Kenzie doesn\u2019t have kleptomania, locking her in an empty room by herself is not going to solve whatever underlying issue exists that is causing her to steal. \n\nOP is right, Kenzie needs to see a therapist and get a diagnosis and treatment for whatever is causing her behavior. And when her friends give her grief for not \u201chelping\u201d her sister, that\u2019s exactly what she should tell them. Doing this will not help Kenzie and may well make her condition worse. She needs appropriate medical care, not a scenario out of a Dr Phil tough love episode.", "NTA! Kenzie doesn\u2019t just need supervision, she needs intense therapy. You didn\u2019t birth her; therefore you have zero responsibility towards her.", "Their lack of parenting should not be your problem.", "NTA! Surely school would be willing to work something out with summer school if she's receiving in-patient or out-patient psychiatric care.", "100% this", "It also won\u2019t be effective, so OP wouldn\u2019t be helping her sister at all.", "  Absolutely NTA Parentification is wrong, especially in a case like this where it's obviously being used to set up the \"responsible\" child for failure along with the avoidance of parental responsibilities.", "100% this", ">and/or attention seeking behaviour. \n\nBased on the parents' request of OP, I'm almost willing to bet money that her problems stem from emotional neglect, and the behaviors are compulsive attention-seeking due to that. If I'm right, their idea will not only not help but will massively backfire and make the behavior worse.", "Yes. I\u2019m not gonna pretend that I know much about kleptomania or it\u2019s proper treatment, but I know enough about mental health to say it isn\u2019t THIS 1940\u2019s shit.", "Bot alert! Stolen comment!", "Bot alert! Comment stolen from u/KiltedPirate", "Bot alert! Stolen comment!", "If you're going to help your sister convincing your parents she needs professional help is the most useful thing you could do here, far more than babysitting her in an empty room. It might be worth talking to Kenzie herself and seeing how she'd feel about therapy, and trying to hook her up with some resources.", "The \u201cwe didn\u2019t raise her that way\u201d mentality is so frustrating to me. My parents didn\u2019t raise me to be anxious and hyper vigilant, but brain chemistry exists separately from morality. You can\u2019t just tell your brain not to produce or react to chemicals because they\u2019re not consistent with your/your family\u2019s morals. \n\nIf you don\u2019t think your parents will be convinced by your concerns about Kenzie\u2019s mental health, look for some testimonials from survivors of \u201cscared straight\u201d programs. Those kinds of setups don\u2019t work and they cause a lot of distress and some really awful life long consequences for the kids who were forced into them. You are absolutely right not to want to be a part of causing that for your sister. If your parents won\u2019t listen to your (correct) opinion of what would help your sister, you can at least opt out of doing a thing that would cause her harm.", "The phrase to use when you call will be \"medical neglect\" because psychological problems are medical problems, and they *are* medically neglecting her. Also, make sure to tell CPS all the details of this plan of theirs and say that you fear they'll find someone else to do it since you have refused. That should get CPS to pay attention.", "Sorry, that's sad. I feel sorry for your sis and for you because you are trying to help her and your parents aren't.", "Have your parents *been* to jail?!?  This doesn\u2019t sound like jail to me. I\u2019ve also never been there but why are we simulating jail and thinking it\u2019s going to be therapeutic?\n\nUh, a couple of my relatives are crackheads and are definitely in a loop where they\u2019ll go to jail for some dumb theft, get out, work construction for crack, more crack, petty theft, jail, construction, crack, theft, jail\u2026..like in trailer park boys. \n\n\u2026. My crackhead cousins don\u2019t mind jail that much? It sucks but don\u2019t go for very long for theft.  Not even jail will scare a person straight from jail.  \n\nThis plan is dumb.  Let them make a dumb fake jail for Kenzie.", "How can you tell? It's a preposterously common comment.", "YES!!! I didn't think of that. I know there's usually a way to get their attention, just couldn't think of any."]}
