Tell her that you want her to know that if she is in trouble you will always be there to listen, even if she got herself into the trouble or it\u2019s from someone responding to her actions.\n\nKleptomania has horrible cycles of stress buildup, compulsive action, and then shame/guilt/self loathing. One of the most powerful things you can do for her when she can\u2019t access therapy is try to short circuit that latter stage. Let there be one person in her life who knows she steals and doesn\u2019t rage at her for it; who treats it as an illness and a symptom. Act like making sure she doesn\u2019t steal is no different to making sure there\u2019s a bucket or a bag for someone with an upset stomach; it\u2019s messy, it\u2019s a big embarrassing for both of us, but it\u2019s not shameful or a commentary on her personality, it\u2019s just something that has to be worked around.

You\u2019re not and they\u2019re not. Don\u2019t let them guilt you into dealing with shit they think is your problem.", "NTA. There\u2019s facilities that can help her. She could get you thrown in jail if she tries that while you\u2019re with her.", "NTA\n\nQuite aside from the fact that you have no obligation to do this - and are therefore quite within your rights to refuse - there are very good reasons why you should not accept this responsibility *even if you were willing.*\n\nYou are not this child's parent or guardian.  You quite simply would not have the authority to discharge this responsibility.  If your sister tells you to go screw, you have literally no legal ability to make her comply.  She could literally call the cops and have you arrested.\n\nYou are not a mental health professional (though your observation of your sister's behaviour before and after an \"incident\" seems very astute; your sister is fortunate that someone in her life is paying attention).  Your sister needs professional help before she ends up with a criminal record.  You are simply not qualified to provide that help.\n\nThe course of action your parents are contemplating is unlikely to help and may exacerbate the problem.  Your sister does not need to be prevented from stealing, she needs to be taught to regulate her stress better.  She does not need to be \"scared straight\": if her thievery is a response to stress, you're just going to trigger more incidents.\n\nYou are this child's sister.  It is not healthy for your relationship with her for you to be stepping into the parental role here.  It is your role to show her understanding and support.  To congratulate her for any progress she makes.  You're her peer, not an authority figure.  Under no circumstances\n\nI think the only real leverage you have with your parents here is their desire to keep all of this on the down-low.  If their main worry is that \"people will talk\" tell them flat-out that if your sister gets arrested, you're going to be telling *everyone* that they refused to get her help.", "90% sure what your parents want you to do is considered abuse imo. Is there any chance she could stay with you and get help from a professional? It might be expensive, especially if they don\u2019t help pay, but she will absolutely be worse off with your parents \u201cmethod\u201d", "NTA. your friend are idiots. Locking her in a room without stuff is both absolutely immoral to begin with and absolutely in no way treatment for a mental issue. She'll be outside at summer school where oh yeah, she can steal, and angry when at home which will make her condition worse and nearly certainly lead to her being kicked out of summer school.\n\nShe needs help, not arbitrary, non helpful punishment cooked up by two idiots in denial. \n\nYou need to call a therapist maybe and have them go and sit down with your parents and explain how people get over kleptomania and explain the average outcome when parents try drastic, unproven and frankly moronic attempts to fix it rather than you know, sitting the damn kid down and trying to find out what is the underlying cause for it.", "Wow your parents are super AH! This has scalated to the point that Kenzie needs profesional help... and you my friend aren\u2019t! You don\u2019t know if the method your parents want to try might increase or decrease her problem.... like your parents need to understand this is long gone away of their hands! I am so sorry they want you now to be a mental health profesional of it", "NTA\n\nThey want you to be the face of the bad person punishing her. They helped this issue get to this point, so they get to be the jailers. They're setting you up to be the baddie in her eyes.", "Ironically this brilliant idea could actually land OP in jail for false imprisonment and kidnapping.  OP's parents are morons.", "Not to mention I'm reasonably sure that what the parents propose is literally illegal.", "Not just that, I'm fairly sure what the parents want here is illegal which is its own slew of problems OP doesn't need.", "Why would she take her in at all?", "Who is going to pay for that if you can\u2019t tell the parents?", "CPS won\u2019t do a single thing about this.", "Why should OP take on the responsibility of raising their 15-year-old sister simply because their parents are refusing to do it? How does that automatically become OP's responsibility, that that is what they should do?", "Many people don't realize that a lot of the time it's actually in your brain. How you were raised doesn't always make a difference.", "OP, this has got to be a hard \"no\" on your part. As you pointed out, you're not a psychologist or a psychiatrist, and Kenzie's problems are way beyond anything you can or should manage. You're NTA for saying no, and you would be if you said yes. This is waaaay out of your lane and too serious to mess with. You're her sibling, not her therapist or her jailer. Don't let you parents push you into becoming either one.\n\nDoes Kenzie have a pediatrician to whom you can talk? Seriously, this is something that Kenzie's physician should know about, and while the physician cannot talk to you about Kenzie without her and/or your parents' consent, *you can alert the physician to the problem.* THAT's where this needs to go - to her doctor and to a referral to an expert, because neither you nor your parents have any kind of expertise in this area. Also, if you report this to her physician, the physician may be able to persuade your parents to take Kenzie to the appropriate therapist.\n\nOf course, your parents will be apopleptic over your disclosing Kenzie's history of theft to her pediatrician. But something has to be done about Kenzie's problem before she steals from someone who won't be bought off by your parents, and then her life really will be a mess for a very long time. Seriously, call her pediatrician and let the doctor know everything you know about Kenzie's history of theft, including your parents paying the jeweler to let her off. All hell will break loose, of course, but that can't be helped - it's your sister's future on the line, and only a skilled professional can solve this one. I wish you all the best.", "Exactly how can CPS make things any worse for Kenzie?  She's headed straight for life as a career criminal if nothing is done, and your parents are determined to do nothing.  This might be Kenzie's last chance to live an actual life.  Don't decide for her that it's not gonna work.  At least give the system a chance to fail for God's sake!", "Also denying Kenzie the ability to leave the house without justification or even a valid diagnosis, is almost definitely illegal.", "Because she might still love her sister and want to help her. As I said, she certainly isn't obligated to.", "Not everyone has to pay out of pocket for health care.", "Oh, which charming country pays for a psychologist and psychiatrist?", "If it was me in the situation, I would not appreciate being strong armed into taking responsibility for a child that's not mine, regardless of blood relation or not. Especially if I had already tried More than once to get them help, or to get them to see what's going on, and I was shut down and told it's not my business and it's not my responsibility. At that point, You've made your choice. And I will make mine.", "For the record, ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy is the official name) is nothing like how it's been depicted in media. It used to be that way in the very beginning, but it hasn't been that way for decades. \n\nYou're put under general anesthesia while it's done for one, so you don't feel it at all. It has been proven to be effective for treatment-resistant depression, which is its most common use case.\n\nSource: Was seriously looking into this when I was really, really depressed. Ended up going for ketamine treatments instead, which actually helped a lot and I'm in a much better place now.\n\nEDIT: Also, [actual source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy) if you want to read up on it.", "Canada..?", "Friend of mine's wife did ECT for depression.\n\nIt worked, but her brain doesn't anymore, not really. \n\nAnyone thinking about doing this: fucking **don't**.", "I have seen people go from catatonic to talkative within a 1/2 hour time frame after ECT. It is highly effective and you're right nothing like it used to be. The voltage is much more controlled and targeted, you're under anaesthesia and a paralytics so you're unaware of what's happening.\n\nThe memory issues in the aftermath are unfortunate but they do tend to get better. If I'm ever super, super severely depressed again and nothing is working, I would genuinely considered ECT if it was offered.", "I live in Alberta and I pay for all psychologists, counselling, psychiatric meds, and occupational therapy. Psychiatry is covered only by physician referral.", "I definitely have to pay for my meds, but therapy is available by making a call to the hotline. They assess and arrange appointments with a therapist.   \nIt's not quite what I expected (too many movies, I imagine) but it's nice having someone to talk to.", "If they did somehow find a free service, which again, you must live in a different part of Canada than I do, the sister would not be able to access it. She\u2019s a minor. She can call the kids help phone by herself and that\u2019s about it.", "I was just suggesting that OP could try to get her sister therapy - 15 is old enough for medical autonomy most places - because I'm concerned that the stealing is a symptom of a much deeper trauma.\n\nI'm not saying it's OPs responsibility, because it's not her child. The simple truth of the matter is that if it comes out in ten or twenty years that Kenzie was doing these things because, for instance, she is being sexually abused, how is OP going to feel, knowing that she didn't try to help her sister? It's a lot of guilt to carry."]}
