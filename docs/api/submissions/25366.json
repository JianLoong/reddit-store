Please.", "If it were that simple to explain the weird custody share, wouldn't OP have done so already?

That\u2019s the number one reason why custody can\u2019t be 50/50 - because the kid has to go to school in one place or the other.\n\nMaybe mom lost out because she did something wrong. Maybe she\u2019s a perfectly good parent who travels a lot for work and therefore can\u2019t have primary custody. Maybe she\u2019s an addict or just got out of jail. Maybe she agreed to to this custody arrangement because dad\u2019s city has better schools. Maybe she got exactly as much custody as she wanted. Maybe she could only afford a terrible lawyer. There are a thousand possibilities.\n\nOP isn\u2019t doing anything wrong by having primary custody, but if he knows that his ex is a good mom and that the custody agreement is about something unrelated to her parenting ability, he should be encouraging a good relationship.", "Me and another poster think this is the same troll from a couple days back.

I agree with the comments of others that a special name for step mom would be more appropriate.", "NTA.", "NTA!! Don't pay attention to the critics.
