This is your failure as a parent. I went through school undiagnosed and could not complete tasks at schools because I simply could not focus. Same goes for homework at home. But I still sat my happy ass down and did what I could to get my shit done. Did I succeed? No it\u2019s nigh impossible to fully focus on a task I didn\u2019t enjoy. But your kids are diagnosed there\u2019s options for you out there to get your kids medicated so they can focus. That and also your kids need to have some discipline.

Do you also give them participation trophies for tying their shoe laces?", "YTA", "Yta because you are bribing your kids to go to school with an activity that sounds like should be for the family, not a reward for going to school. Does she get a trip if she goes to work for three months? What about if she brushes her teeth? If you wanna give out rewards for doing basically nothing, then you should for all your children. \n\nI'm sure they have ADHD. But it seems they know how to work you really well. I have ADHD and I like to think we are quite clever. Thing is though, you are only setting them up for failure. You need to give them the tools to sit in school or have them in a special program to get them the support they need. It is not normal to bribe children to go to school. I'd be annoyed too if my mom did this for my siblings and I didn't get to go on the reward because I never had to be bribed to go to school. You know what's a reward for going to school? Passing onto the next grade with all your friends. \n\nAgain I have ADHD and it's insulting that you use that to excuse you and your children's behavior. Being a liar is not a symptom of ADHD. I was difficult for my parents and teachers but I sure wasn't lying about being sick to get out of school. I did spend a decent amount of time in detention for being disruptive in class or forgetting my homework.

Then 2 weeks from the end of the semester when they realize they are failing, they want to know what I am going to do about it. Because it is MY fault. It is NEVER THEIR fault. Don't get me wrong, I also have plenty of students with ADHD that have been taught plenty of coping skills, and can grow into amazing adults. But parents like this that have turned ADHD into an excuse for their child to do nothing for the rest of their life are the bane of my existence.", "Yta\n\nPerhaps try to take your daughter at a later time.

I have ADHD, diagnosed when I was around 7-8, and it was never remotely ok for me to miss school because I hated it (???). You are permitting and teaching your kids that they don\u2019t have to do things that they don\u2019t want to, regardless if it\u2019s in their best interest, just because they \u201chate it\u201d. That is 1000% setting them up for a hard life in the future and is preventing them from getting into a set schedule (which is needed for kids with ADHD). I\u2019m SO confused by the decision making that is happening in regards to your two young, minor children. It\u2019s not even a situation in which they are able to say \u201cyeah, I\u2019ll drive myself to school today\u201d and then they just skip\u2026.

Part of adulting is that we don\u2019t always get to join the family outings due to adult commitments.", "NTA for not moving the trip to accommodate your eldest. I have a ten year gap with my little sibling, so I totally sympathize with your eldest that it sucks to miss out on fun family stuff because you're at a different point in your life. But missing a day of school would totally undermine the entire message you have been trying to impress on your younger two for the past couple of months. \n\nHowever, you and your husband (with the help of the kids' teachers) need to figure out a better way to accommodate the kids' needs in the classroom and teach the kids strategies to manage their ADHD. You're not setting them up for long term success by just bribing their compliance.", "NTA for the question you asked but you are absolutely the a-hole for failing to properly parent your children. Have you spoken with the school? I\u2019m sure if you talked to them and explained what they are doing then they can make amendments to the rules to try and avoid these fake sick calls. Is the school working with them for their ADHD? Are YOU doing anything to help them? Are they in therapy? This sounds like you are failing your younger children.", "The judgement in this chat\u2026ignoring why you promised the trip, your daughter cannot suggest taking kids out of school for an amusement park because her work schedule is inconvenient. She could ask for a day off or not go. And nothing is stopping her going another day with friends. \n\nI had awful attendance as a kid, I think high 60s was the best you could expect from me. I\u2019m neurodivergent and the school environment made me stressed and exhausted from being overstimulated. Plus the fact that kids can be very mean. Schools do not fit everyone equally and OP do you judge yourself for finding a solution to get your sons into the routine of school. It is so difficult to break the habit of wanting to leave when anything stressful occurs and I bet they will be more likely to make it through the whole day now out of practice.", "NTA because the issue here is your oldest. She needs to just sit down and relax. I mean, come on. If the point is rewarding the younger once for going to school, she is old enough to see that taking them out of school will undermine the whole thing. So stick to your guns.

Yeah, I'm noping out of that discussion.", "NTA its pointless getting the kids to take off school during the week, the whole point of the reward is to get them to GO to school, it would set a bad example, how doesn't a 20yr old get that?? Shes being selfish, go during the weekend, she'll just have to get over it", "NTA You made a deal with your boys to a achieve a goal. They did. Now it's time for you to hold up your end of the deal. Your daughter needs to grow up and accept that not everything in life will work in her favor. She's asking you to take the boys out of school for a day which kind of kills the point. Why doesn't she ask for a day off from work? If they can take a day from school she can take a day from work. It works both ways.", "NTA\n\nLet her be disappointed. She\u2019s allowed to be disappointed that the younger kids get to do something and she can\u2019t go. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to change your plans.

I worked weekends at age 20 and had to miss out on stuff like this as well. It\u2019s called being an adult. You would not be doing your boys any favors calling them out of school and this trip is supposed to be for them, not their sister. If she wants to go that badly, she can ask for a day off work.

Please disregard all comments from people who don't understand your parenting challenges. you are doing great.\n\nRegarding your 20-yr-old - she's being unreasonable and acting like a child. I'm wondering if living at home is making it hard for her to break out of \"teen\" behaviors and fully mature. Might be worth thinking about how to help her \"reset\" a bit more. Not saying kick her out, but sounds like she is having maturity issues and might need some help having space made for her to grow.", "I don't blame your older child.

This is not something that should be causing them to miss school. Your daughters comment of \"skip one day\" pretty much tells me that you just allow it and don't set any boundaries for them.

You are doing them a massive disservice.", "You're N T A for your older daughter, she needs to learn that you will miss events for work and not everything can be accommodated to her schedule.

In my own personal opinion, your are NTA for the question you asked. In the first place, this entire thing is about making sure your kids go to school. As such, taking them out of school to do something not seriously important (doctors visit, family emergency) would be kind of backwards. It sucks for your daughter, but sometimes work just works out that way. I've been there. I would probably apologize but be firm in the facts, and next time try to plan things a little further in advance so she could take that day off.", "NTA and I honestly can\u2019t believe there are people saying you are.

I missed ALOT of family vacations, holidays, etc.  If you are 20 years old, living at home, and your parents are still raising kids, your presence is not required, if you can make it, great, if you can\u2019t, then you can\u2019t, but it\u2019s entirely unreasonable to expect your parents to change plans to accommodate you\u2026cause you\u2019re grown\u2026go to the amusement park with your friends\u2026", "NTA. If she wants to join you, she can take a day off of work for it. What she wants is to join you without having to make any consideration of it.

I don\u2019t know if you discussed the trip with her beforehand - if you didn\u2019t, perhaps in the future, you could do so so she can request time off.

I am in college and am missing a bunch of fundamental skills from different subjects due to missing school. If you cannot reliably get your kids to school you have a few options \n\n1. take them to a therapist to try to figure out the deeper meaning of this. (they should see a therapist either way since adhd is heavily linked to other mental illnesses and social issues.) \n\n2. get them both formally diagnosed (if they are not already) and get a IEP or a 504 plan. (again, this should be done anyway) \n\n3. Consider a school catered to kids with learning disabilities where they are taught specifically how to deal with those issues. \n\nI understand how hard it is to have to get kids who hate school to school, trust me. I was the kid that was having screaming matches, having the blankets ripped off of me, having privileges taken away, etc. IT IS NOT A FUN ROUTINE FOR ANYBODY INVOLVED. I ended up having to repeat years and having significant gaps in my learning. In addition to that, I had to be sent to a therapeutic boarding school due to my school avoidance. I do not want your children to have to endure the same thing. You can also set up a plan for when your kids fake sick to go to the nurse, because if the school is aware they will make sure something is done about it. \n\nFinal thoughts: \n\nit\u2019s hard enough to get small children to do anything, let alone do something they don\u2019t enjoy, so I understand being frustrated with people who are saying Y T A. You need to be a united front with your husband on this issue, as well as you have to take into account that maybe 6 is doing this because he sees 9 doing this and is copying because he sees it working. Although I do not exactly approve of the way you are doing things now, I think some people are being a tad harsh in what they are saying and it\u2019s hard to take advice from someone who is belittling or insulting you. \n\nI will also reply to DMs if you want to speak to me about this.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

In terms of behaviour management and psychological intervention for diagnosis like adhd both would be considered positive reinforcement and you recommend whatever the child will find most rewarding which in this case is clearly a day out.\n\n If anything the day out is far better than the playing video games for longer because its not as regular and so is far less likely to become reliant on. If you're suggesting that its the same time period but a lower reward like video game time no child is going to do anything for the promise that in 3 months they can have an extra 30 minutes on a video game, the motivation is too low. The idea is to get the child regularly doing the thing they are struggling with and then scale the reinforcement  back. A regular treat like additional video games will be much harder to scale back since its daily and even kids without additional needs have problems with video games.\n\n Having a trip at the end of the year for attendance is a very very common thing that schools do. When children have additional needs and things they're struggling with its also very common to introduce these behaviour management tactics more frequently. So this time it was 3 months, next time it will be 6 months and next year they'll work to having the 1 trip with school that everyone does. \n\nAlso I really don't understand the issue that everyone has with 'bribing'.

Go have some kids and then come back and talk", "OK but that wasn't the question (hers or mine), I'm not gonna get into the ins and outs of parenting - I don't have kids so I'm probably not the best person to comment - but the OP asked a specific question that so far no one seems to be answering.", "OK but again that isn't what was asked, rather than repeat the same thing can you actually answer the question? Cos she didn't ask if she was the AH for the trip itself, and neither did I.", "I would say with ADHD the star charts are a hit or a miss and may work better with younger kids than older. Getting to put a sticker on the chart next to my name did release a little dopamine. I can see older kids not caring as much. I do think it is much easier though for those with ADHD inattentive type than ADHD with physical hyperactivity to receive stickers for their name on a chart. Since I have ADHD inattentive type it was easy for me to sit still, be quiet, and me staring off into space/daydreaming lots probably looked like I was paying attention when my mind was somewhere else entirely.", "> Yeah\u2026 that kind of thing often doesn\u2019t help kids or adults who have adhd and lack the \u201creward function\u201d in their brain. I never gave two shits about star charts or progress stickers.\n> \n> \u201cADHD brains do not adapt as easily; they have their own rules of engagement. They are motivated by their search for optimal stimulation, rather than by what others label as important.\n\nMy kid with ADHD in kindergarten noticed the reward chart. Each day you could get a green star, a yellow star or blue star. He managed green all the time (good behavior), got a yellow or two (minor class discipline), and worked towards blue. Blue was a principle referral :-)", "My ADHD brain friggin' loves seeing a nice completed row of stars/checkmarks/stickers/colored boxes. Miss a single day and the whole chart goes out the window. That one flaw in it makes it worthless and I don't want it anymore. \n\nOddly enough I still kind of rely on \"star charts\", sort of -- they keep me from forgetting because right now my little calendar chart is pretty, and as long as I keep up with remembering, it *stays* pretty.", "Okay, I don't know what the hell is wrong with this thread  but you are NTA. My mom stopped taking us on family trips as soon as we were 18, and when the last one (me) turned 18, she would Just travel on Romantic trips with my father. We still do stuff together, go places, but a part of growing up is understanding your parents regain some of their autonomy to make choices that don't involve you...and also, I'm Glad you are not forcing your kids to just endure school and trying to work out better habits and Control trought their own choices...you are a good mom and your Daughter is Just being needy (probably upset for being an adult now, I mean...It does sucks).", "If it\u2019s a pattern then obviously not, you could easily talk to the front office and let them know that they have this pattern and unless they actually look sick they need to stay in school. But obviously if your kids are doing this often they should know this by now", "The kid is six, not sixteen. Attendance is definitely important", "We can get punished for not doing what we are supposed to do, but it isn't the best way to reinforce a behavior.  It only works perfectly if the person has no other options.  Like cheating on our taxes.  We can get in trouble for not doing them correctly, but there are a ton of ways to get around it.  Simply put, punishments teach someone to avoid punishments, but it leaves the strategy in their hands.", "This. I have adhd. The few times I faked sick as a kid my mom implemented the \u201cif you\u2019re too sick for school you need to be resting quietly\u201d rule which made home way more boring than going to school. It\u2019s fine to reward them for a job well done, but not when you exclude another kid who hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. YTA", "I have ADHD and I'm an RN. My kids don't even try any work arounds because they know I can tell the difference between overwhelm and weaseling out and a fake illness vs actual symptoms.\n\nThe wisdom of old age was provided to me along with my middle age diagnosis paperwork I guess.", "Well, it's a bit unusual that people judge everything except the actual question asked.", "that's not what she's asking judgment about, y'all just woke up sanctimonious today.", "Did you miss the part where this entire debate is based around the fact that they stopped having attendance issues?", "From the outside, low demand parenting can look very much like permissive parenting. I have an 11yo on the spectrum. He has alexithymia and struggles with interoception. When he is at school and nears threshold levels of activation he will go to the office and complain of a random illness so he can come home and meltdown in a place he feels safe. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to look at children behaving a certain way and think they\u2019re just being shits but this is rarely the case with kids struggling to survive in world that wasn\u2019t designed for them.  A little kindness, care and compassion goes a long way.  \n\n\u201cKids do well when they can,\u201d and when they can\u2019t, it\u2019s because they are delayed in the development of crucial cognitive skills\u201d - Ross W.

All jobs are bribes by that definition", "Yes, but if you have ADHD, you have more challenges than 90% of the kids. Not everybody is the same.", "I will when you stop trying to use having ADHD as an excuse for bad behavior.", "Honestly it depends on where you live. Where I live it's not required (but it's encouraged) to come get kids from school unless their actively throwing up or have a fever, and they can come back the next day.\nWhere I used to live it was you couldn't get your kid at all unless you signed them out and they had permission from you to let them leave. \nWhere my mom lives with my younger siblings, you absolutely have to get your children if they're seemingly sick, no ifs, ands, or buts. My autistic brother figured this out and makes himself throw up so he can go home, which also means he gets to stay home the next day because of his parishes policy.", "My daughter is almost 9, had zero symptoms, no fever. She told the nurse her bones hurt. I told the nurse it was probably growing pains, and they didn't care. I needed to pick her up regardless. The latest one was stomach pains. No fever again, but they said she needed to be picked up. She just needed to take a big poop, lol. She doesn't go to the nurse very often, she really loves school, so I know she wasn't faking. But they do send them home for anything now.", ">Unless the child is showing Covid symptoms (last time I checked you can't fake a fever)\n\nWhile I think OP is YTA because this is a child discipline problem and the carrot is not the answer here, your premise is very flawed. I'm in Canada and not the US however covid rules are very similar from what I'm aware. School policy here is runny nose, cough, upset stomach, excessive sneezing, or stuffy nose will all get you sent home here for covid symptoms and a stuffy nose and cough are very easy to fake.", "Here\u2019s the thing: the kids don\u2019t have other options. In many countries, kids are required by law to go to school. I remember when I was first grade, I asked my mom why she kept insisting I go to school and she said: \u201cit\u2019s not me insisting, it\u2019s the state.\u201d The kids have to go to school so they shouldn\u2019t be rewarded as if they have a choice.", "\"How did I get here? Where am I? Are you playing with lightning? That's awesome, I want to play with lightning. Oh look, an owl!\"", "ADHD adult here, can confirm.", "Thats my rule too! If your too sick for school, you are too sick for tv, games, going outside, eating anything other than soup and cracker, etc. You find out really quick they arent really sick.", "Oh fuck what have I done", "You need 2 tests 48 hrs apart if they are showing 2 or more of a long list of symptoms or have a fever at my kids school. They can come back earlier if you get a doctors note with another cause for the symptoms.\n\nThe antigen tests are meant to be taken in series- a still negative doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have covid.", "Yup. My asthmatic kid was sent home repeatedly last year because she was coughing.", "It must be a school to school thing. I know at my son's school, they are not automatically sent home. My son has allergies and if that was the case my child would be sent home everyday lol!", "Aren\u2019t you\u2026 behind a screen asking for our opinions? \ud83d\ude02 read the room", "Why did you post here just to argue with everyone? You asked ayta and people chimed in. If you didn\u2019t want other opinions maybe don\u2019t post?", "You know there are people that have it worse off than you but they don\u2019t give in to their kids demands right?", "That's true.  But it sounds like they were being rewarded for not interrupting class and going to the nurse.  In which case, yeah, they could have been punished for doing *that*.  But ultimately she set a really long term goal for a good behavior and seems to have solved the problem for now.  I'm actually shocked that two kids with adhd were able to control their behavior daily for something that far off.  OP may have been doing some poor parenting that led to this, but for this particular choice I don't think she needs to be judged harshly.", "My mom found these VHS tapes at a garage sale that were like 100 hours of various Geology lectures. \n\nIf she suspected I was faking sick, I couldn\u2019t read books or watch tv or anything else. My only options she gave were watching those insanely dry, boring lectures or literally sleeping all day. \n\nMade me never want to skip school again, but some of it actually got retained apparently, because I remembered a lot of random info that was helpful when I had to take a GEO class in college!", "My sister had to provide a doctor's note to handle this situation with my nephew, they were sending him home 3 days a week until my sister could prove its not covid related.", "Definitely is a school to school thing. My child has allergies too and I had to provide a doctors note because they kept sending him home.", "My friend experienced something similar. Her son had allergies and asthma. He had doctors\u2019 notes, meds, etc, and would still get sent home so often that she finally had to hire a lawyer. It was insane. \n\n\nThe poor kid would be in tears, begging not to be sent home because he was falling so far behind due to missing so much school. He wasn\u2019t even using his inhaler because he was afraid the nurse would send him home.", "My child went to school way before covid, he also has ADHD and some mental health issues. The school wasn't inclined to keep him at school when he wanted to come home because he also became more of a challenge if he didn't want to be there and his support team was overworked as it was.", "Issue is the type of job. At mine, I can request days off before the schedule is published, but I don\u2019t get sick/vacation time. I\u2019d have to call in or find someone to cover my shift. And if the daughter calls into work and they see photos of her online not sick, well. There goes the job.\n\nThey could always plan the trip on the weekend, a few weeks in advance. That should essentially keep the kids in school, and also allow daughter enough time to request a day off. Easy solution.", "the alternative is presumably to punish them if they don't go? i don't see how that's any better, the reward and the punishment are both external consequences, and the reward gives everyone a better feeling about the whole thing."]}
