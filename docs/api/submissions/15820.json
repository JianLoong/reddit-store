This is your failure as a parent. I went through school undiagnosed and could not complete tasks at schools because I simply could not focus. Same goes for homework at home. But I still sat my happy ass down and did what I could to get my shit done. Did I succeed? No it\u2019s nigh impossible to fully focus on a task I didn\u2019t enjoy. But your kids are diagnosed there\u2019s options for you out there to get your kids medicated so they can focus. That and also your kids need to have some discipline.

Do you also give them participation trophies for tying their shoe laces?", "YTA", "Yta because you are bribing your kids to go to school with an activity that sounds like should be for the family, not a reward for going to school. Does she get a trip if she goes to work for three months? What about if she brushes her teeth? If you wanna give out rewards for doing basically nothing, then you should for all your children. \n\nI'm sure they have ADHD. But it seems they know how to work you really well. I have ADHD and I like to think we are quite clever. Thing is though, you are only setting them up for failure. You need to give them the tools to sit in school or have them in a special program to get them the support they need. It is not normal to bribe children to go to school. I'd be annoyed too if my mom did this for my siblings and I didn't get to go on the reward because I never had to be bribed to go to school. You know what's a reward for going to school? Passing onto the next grade with all your friends. \n\nAgain I have ADHD and it's insulting that you use that to excuse you and your children's behavior. Being a liar is not a symptom of ADHD. I was difficult for my parents and teachers but I sure wasn't lying about being sick to get out of school. I did spend a decent amount of time in detention for being disruptive in class or forgetting my homework.

Then 2 weeks from the end of the semester when they realize they are failing, they want to know what I am going to do about it. Because it is MY fault. It is NEVER THEIR fault. Don't get me wrong, I also have plenty of students with ADHD that have been taught plenty of coping skills, and can grow into amazing adults. But parents like this that have turned ADHD into an excuse for their child to do nothing for the rest of their life are the bane of my existence.", "Yta\n\nPerhaps try to take your daughter at a later time.

I have ADHD, diagnosed when I was around 7-8, and it was never remotely ok for me to miss school because I hated it (???). You are permitting and teaching your kids that they don\u2019t have to do things that they don\u2019t want to, regardless if it\u2019s in their best interest, just because they \u201chate it\u201d. That is 1000% setting them up for a hard life in the future and is preventing them from getting into a set schedule (which is needed for kids with ADHD). I\u2019m SO confused by the decision making that is happening in regards to your two young, minor children. It\u2019s not even a situation in which they are able to say \u201cyeah, I\u2019ll drive myself to school today\u201d and then they just skip\u2026.

I have a ten year gap with my little sibling, so I totally sympathize with your eldest that it sucks to miss out on fun family stuff because you're at a different point in your life. But missing a day of school would totally undermine the entire message you have been trying to impress on your younger two for the past couple of months. \n\nHowever, you and your husband (with the help of the kids' teachers) need to figure out a better way to accommodate the kids' needs in the classroom and teach the kids strategies to manage their ADHD. You're not setting them up for long term success by just bribing their compliance.", "NTA for the question you asked but you are absolutely the a-hole for failing to properly parent your children. Have you spoken with the school? I\u2019m sure if you talked to them and explained what they are doing then they can make amendments to the rules to try and avoid these fake sick calls. Is the school working with them for their ADHD? Are YOU doing anything to help them? Are they in therapy? This sounds like you are failing your younger children.", "The judgement in this chat\u2026ignoring why you promised the trip, your daughter cannot suggest taking kids out of school for an amusement park because her work schedule is inconvenient. She could ask for a day off or not go. And nothing is stopping her going another day with friends. \n\nI had awful attendance as a kid, I think high 60s was the best you could expect from me. I\u2019m neurodivergent and the school environment made me stressed and exhausted from being overstimulated. Plus the fact that kids can be very mean. Schools do not fit everyone equally and OP do you judge yourself for finding a solution to get your sons into the routine of school. It is so difficult to break the habit of wanting to leave when anything stressful occurs and I bet they will be more likely to make it through the whole day now out of practice.", "NTA because the issue here is your oldest. She needs to just sit down and relax. I mean, come on. If the point is rewarding the younger once for going to school, she is old enough to see that taking them out of school will undermine the whole thing. So stick to your guns.

Yeah, I'm noping out of that discussion.", "NTA its pointless getting the kids to take off school during the week, the whole point of the reward is to get them to GO to school, it would set a bad example, how doesn't a 20yr old get that?? Shes being selfish, go during the weekend, she'll just have to get over it", "NTA You made a deal with your boys to a achieve a goal. They did. Now it's time for you to hold up your end of the deal. Your daughter needs to grow up and accept that not everything in life will work in her favor. She's asking you to take the boys out of school for a day which kind of kills the point. Why doesn't she ask for a day off from work? If they can take a day from school she can take a day from work. It works both ways.", "NTA\n\nLet her be disappointed. She\u2019s allowed to be disappointed that the younger kids get to do something and she can\u2019t go. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to change your plans.

I worked weekends at age 20 and had to miss out on stuff like this as well. It\u2019s called being an adult. You would not be doing your boys any favors calling them out of school and this trip is supposed to be for them, not their sister. If she wants to go that badly, she can ask for a day off work.

Please disregard all comments from people who don't understand your parenting challenges. you are doing great.\n\nRegarding your 20-yr-old - she's being unreasonable and acting like a child. I'm wondering if living at home is making it hard for her to break out of \"teen\" behaviors and fully mature. Might be worth thinking about how to help her \"reset\" a bit more.

This is not something that should be causing them to miss school. Your daughters comment of \"skip one day\" pretty much tells me that you just allow it and don't set any boundaries for them.

You are doing them a massive disservice.", "You're N T A for your older daughter, she needs to learn that you will miss events for work and not everything can be accommodated to her schedule.

In my own personal opinion, your are NTA for the question you asked. In the first place, this entire thing is about making sure your kids go to school. As such, taking them out of school to do something not seriously important (doctors visit, family emergency) would be kind of backwards. It sucks for your daughter, but sometimes work just works out that way. I've been there. I would probably apologize but be firm in the facts, and next time try to plan things a little further in advance so she could take that day off.", "NTA and I honestly can\u2019t believe there are people saying you are.

I missed ALOT of family vacations, holidays, etc.  If you are 20 years old, living at home, and your parents are still raising kids, your presence is not required, if you can make it, great, if you can\u2019t, then you can\u2019t, but it\u2019s entirely unreasonable to expect your parents to change plans to accommodate you\u2026cause you\u2019re grown\u2026go to the amusement park with your friends\u2026", "NTA.

I don\u2019t know if you discussed the trip with her beforehand - if you didn\u2019t, perhaps in the future, you could do so so she can request time off.

I am in college and am missing a bunch of fundamental skills from different subjects due to missing school. If you cannot reliably get your kids to school you have a few options \n\n1. take them to a therapist to try to figure out the deeper meaning of this. (they should see a therapist either way since adhd is heavily linked to other mental illnesses and social issues.) \n\n2. get them both formally diagnosed (if they are not already) and get a IEP or a 504 plan. (again, this should be done anyway) \n\n3. Consider a school catered to kids with learning disabilities where they are taught specifically how to deal with those issues. \n\nI understand how hard it is to have to get kids who hate school to school, trust me. I was the kid that was having screaming matches, having the blankets ripped off of me, having privileges taken away, etc. IT IS NOT A FUN ROUTINE FOR ANYBODY INVOLVED. I ended up having to repeat years and having significant gaps in my learning. In addition to that, I had to be sent to a therapeutic boarding school due to my school avoidance. I do not want your children to have to endure the same thing. You can also set up a plan for when your kids fake sick to go to the nurse, because if the school is aware they will make sure something is done about it. \n\nFinal thoughts: \n\nit\u2019s hard enough to get small children to do anything, let alone do something they don\u2019t enjoy, so I understand being frustrated with people who are saying Y T A. You need to be a united front with your husband on this issue, as well as you have to take into account that maybe 6 is doing this because he sees 9 doing this and is copying because he sees it working. Although I do not exactly approve of the way you are doing things now, I think some people are being a tad harsh in what they are saying and it\u2019s hard to take advice from someone who is belittling or insulting you. \n\nI will also reply to DMs if you want to speak to me about this.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

In terms of behaviour management and psychological intervention for diagnosis like adhd both would be considered positive reinforcement and you recommend whatever the child will find most rewarding which in this case is clearly a day out.\n\n If anything the day out is far better than the playing video games for longer because its not as regular and so is far less likely to become reliant on. If you're suggesting that its the same time period but a lower reward like video game time no child is going to do anything for the promise that in 3 months they can have an extra 30 minutes on a video game, the motivation is too low. The idea is to get the child regularly doing the thing they are struggling with and then scale the reinforcement  back. A regular treat like additional video games will be much harder to scale back since its daily and even kids without additional needs have problems with video games.\n\n Having a trip at the end of the year for attendance is a very very common thing that schools do. When children have additional needs and things they're struggling with its also very common to introduce these behaviour management tactics more frequently. So this time it was 3 months, next time it will be 6 months and next year they'll work to having the 1 trip with school that everyone does. \n\nAlso I really don't understand the issue that everyone has with 'bribing'.

Its like people who say its self defense even if the person \"defending\" themselves caused the situation and was threatening the other person. OP is asking about not changing the day.

You don't think she'd be resentful of the boys getting special treatment like getting to skip school and getting rewarded to go? That impacts whether id rule her the AH. Not giving her the same treatment and refusing to attempt to include her would tell me OP doesn't give a shit about her. I won't call someone who just wants to go with her family an AH. Especially over such a trivial situation where OPs description of events is lacking so much detail. OP gave plenty of detail about her boys but is vague about the person this is supposed to be about. If she didn't want judgement partially based on how they parent their boys, why is that where they were most detailed?\n\nI don't like the language OP used in her post. It tells me a lot about how they coddle their boys and does not do that with her daughter. They said they won't \"give in\" to her daughter asking them to change the date but has no problem caving to allow the boys to skip school and bribes them to go. OPs attitude toward their daughter implies they regularly leave her out. I also don't think the daughter is being an AH just by telling OP she wanted her to move it and telling her the impact it has on her. OP referred to it as whining. I can't take people seriously when they call it that. Its almost always overexaggerated. Usually when I hear someone say it, the person they were referring to was just saying something they didn't like in a normal tone.

That defeats the purpose of asking for advice on something in question. \n\nI think the fair criticisms are the ones that answer the judgement at hand and then can pass secondary judgment in other things should they choose. If the context everyone is judging on has a direct correlation to the Q at hand, then sure. But OP literally could have omitted the schooling part or someone else could have a similar issue without the schooling ADHD issue, where two young kids were promised a day at the amusement park and an older sister is upset bc she works weekends and can't come AITA?", "I had students who would force themselves to throw up to skip. Seen kids as young as five do it if they\u2019re determined enough not to stay the day.", "Hey Im not claiming it, but if you can guarantee without a shadow of a doubt, 100% facts, and not just a general assumption that what OP is saying is false then you should be saying, YTA OP bc you're a liar", "Kids with ADHD work better with a rewards system in place. As a kid with ADHD, I just asked to get stickers for a reward, never got them but other kids did. I wasn't diagnosed so I was just a bad kid who didn't earn my stickers for being good because I should be behaving anyway. \n\nSo I just kept doing my thing. I went to school ok, but I hated it there. I loved learning but the other kids weren't nice and neither were the teachers. I was dealing with adhd and being abused at home. Of cause I acted out in school more then home because I was safe to test boundaries in school.  My acting out was just adhd issues really, rocking back in my chair so I could swing my legs and focus on the lesson. My shouting out answers was just me trying desperately to get the class moving so we could get to the classwork and probably me being impulsive. I was a chatterbox early on, by 9/10 I stopped mostly. \n\nSo yeah, kids need a reward system. I wish I had one. Everyone just focused on my bad stuff rather then my good. Mum was awful for it, the best example was one parents evening. I got 100% on an end of year exam. One of two kids in the entire school, the other kid sat next to me in class. We laughed our asses off about it. My teacher was so excited to tell my mum who didn't react at all. The look on my teachers face said it all when I just shrugged slightly. Mum didn't care. She was focused on that awful 75% I got in French. I was awful at languages, just couldn't grasp them and still can't. It was an average grade and I did well for me. Nope, not good enough for her. All my other classes I got good grades. Then a teacher mentioned something silly and my mum rounded on me, I remember that teacher panicked as well and she knew instantly from my reaction mum was going to beat the crap out of me when I got home. All because of a single stupid comment I'd made in class that week. It wasn't even bad and I remember thinking why would she bring that up? Mum focused on all the negative things and yes, I was an anxious mess. Yes, I was punished for being a bad kid and getting bad grades... French was the only class I didn't get an A in. I had no detentions, no issues with shouting out anymore or rocking back etc. I wasn't sent out of any classed, yet one bad grade and one general comment about something I'd said was all the evidence she needed...", "a reward system \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f literally everyone has been saying that to you.", "Your kids have severe attendance issues at that age? Yup that\u2019s a parenting problem.", "Sounds to me like ADHD isn\u2019t the culprit of bad behavior and that it\u2019s actually the ODD.

Kindergarten through 3rd grade every parent teacher conference I was told my kid is intelligent, funny, delightful to have in class. But she blurted out the answers all the time and talked a lot in class. Every time I asked about ADHD and her teachers said no. 3rd grade teacher I asked the same question, he asked if my kid could go to the book fair so we could talk. He confirmed my suspicion that my kid was ADHD. With his help we got the ball rolling and she improved dramatically behavior wise. \n\nShe's now in high school and told me how those behavior star charts in school were so humiliating, having the whole class know if you're pleasing the teacher or not. So I wouldn't really follow the notion that they're good motivators.", "I was literally thinking the same thing about incentive charts/ token boards. As a special education teacher we use token boards all the time to have kids use positive reinforcement to change behavior. 3 months is a long time and they did it.

Him and his little brother just aren\u2019t attending school at all and I worry about them.", "Mine has gone so extreme as to fake a diabetic coma (she's type 1) in order to get sent home.

Just because it doesn't work for all kids doesn't mean there won't be ones it does work for. \n\nShe had an issue and found a way to make things work with her kids. It's not like she was beating them. The whole issue was attendance at school, pulling them our of school for a day seems somewhat counter productive. Older daughter can book the day off or find coverage. It sucks being an adult sometimes but that's life.", "Yep, and PDA (Pathological Demand Avoidance) shows up with kids with ADHD.  It's hard a lot of times to find what will work, and it changes as well. \n\nThat said, OP, NTA. Your daughter is 20 and sadly this is part of growing up. Adults don't get summer break or get to go to all the fun things that are planned. And that's okay. But it sucks learning that lesson as well. Maybe plan a parent and daughter day when she isn't working, so that she can understand that she's not being purposely excluded, but that it is a part of growing up not to be able to go to everything.", "Why would you put them in a carpet? Wouldn\u2019t that just be harder than not doing that?", "Yeah, I am a late-diagnosed adult with ADHD but when I speak to psychs about the details they are shocked and horrified it didn't get caught because it was so clear and debilitating and my attendance was fucking horrific. No way could my single mother who worked full time with overtime just magically make me attend better, and she did try to seek help. But there are so many people with less severe ADHD who love to go around judging people for whom it's more disabling, because for them it isn't. It drives me up the wall.", "Exactly! I have ADHD as well as my daughter, I was late diagnosed. I didn\u2019t have issues going to school like she does, I get that it affects us differently even though we have similar symptoms a lot of the time.", "Hell, I was a kindergartner and was able to slip out of school during recess.

A 20yo should be able to see how much easier their life is not having the major attention span issues though.", "I absolutely concede that that is a possibility.", "It's not \"bribing\", it's a fun reward that motivates the kids to go to school. This comment section is just a big circle jerk at this point", "Well, what\u2019s the solution then?", "Tell us what the solution is", "So what do you suggest then? \n\nI have tried taking away all privileges including screen time and fun activities or events he was excited about, taking him to DR's and councilors for professional help and an official ADHD diagnosis, getting an IEP in place at the school and making sure the teacher and nurses know when he is trying to get sent home, getting a tutor to help as he was falling behind in reading, talking to him about the consequences of his actions, reminding him of the negatives that happened the previous day so he can edit his behavior for the current day, reading parenting books and taking the advice of everyone i have asked...\n\nThe ONLY thing that has even remotely worked with my 8 year old is a reward system of some kind. \n\nSo tell me again how I and others like me are doing all of this work and are bad parents. What the hell do you want us to do?", "Come on, a 6 and 9 year old with ADHD waited three months to be rewarded?

Girl with adhd here who got zero help beyond being told I was a bad kid/person. It freaking sucked. I had the exact same behaviour and spent more time outside of class then in it. I was smart as well and somehow got good grades but I sure as hell couldn't sit still. One comment I remember was my head teacher telling my mum I'd be brilliant if they could get me to sit still and focus. \n\nI'm trying to get help as an adult, because my mum refused to have an diagnosis put on my record, I'm on a four year wait list as it's too expensive to go private... I could get help in six months if I could afford it... I'm really sad about it.", "I don't know. Being rewarded with extra reading time when I finished my other school work sure worked for me. \nStickers, grades etc. Did nothing for me.\n\nI think it's a matter of finding which reward works for your ADHD child.

You have responded only defensively and have not given any examples of what you think this person should do. Your judgmental comments aren't even about the problem  OP asked about. \n\nI take comments like yours personally because, as a group, parents of ADHD kids are belittled like this on a regular basis.
