This is your failure as a parent. I went through school undiagnosed and could not complete tasks at schools because I simply could not focus. Same goes for homework at home. But I still sat my happy ass down and did what I could to get my shit done. Did I succeed? No it\u2019s nigh impossible to fully focus on a task I didn\u2019t enjoy.

If you wanna give out rewards for doing basically nothing, then you should for all your children. \n\nI'm sure they have ADHD. But it seems they know how to work you really well. I have ADHD and I like to think we are quite clever. Thing is though, you are only setting them up for failure. You need to give them the tools to sit in school or have them in a special program to get them the support they need. It is not normal to bribe children to go to school. I'd be annoyed too if my mom did this for my siblings and I didn't get to go on the reward because I never had to be bribed to go to school. You know what's a reward for going to school? Passing onto the next grade with all your friends. \n\nAgain I have ADHD and it's insulting that you use that to excuse you and your children's behavior. Being a liar is not a symptom of ADHD.

I did spend a decent amount of time in detention for being disruptive in class or forgetting my homework.

Then 2 weeks from the end of the semester when they realize they are failing, they want to know what I am going to do about it. Because it is MY fault. It is NEVER THEIR fault.

That is 1000% setting them up for a hard life in the future and is preventing them from getting into a set schedule (which is needed for kids with ADHD). I\u2019m SO confused by the decision making that is happening in regards to your two young, minor children. It\u2019s not even a situation in which they are able to say \u201cyeah, I\u2019ll drive myself to school today\u201d and then they just skip\u2026.

I have a ten year gap with my little sibling, so I totally sympathize with your eldest that it sucks to miss out on fun family stuff because you're at a different point in your life. But missing a day of school would totally undermine the entire message you have been trying to impress on your younger two for the past couple of months. \n\nHowever, you and your husband (with the help of the kids' teachers) need to figure out a better way to accommodate the kids' needs in the classroom and teach the kids strategies to manage their ADHD. You're not setting them up for long term success by just bribing their compliance.", "NTA for the question you asked but you are absolutely the a-hole for failing to properly parent your children. Have you spoken with the school? I\u2019m sure if you talked to them and explained what they are doing then they can make amendments to the rules to try and avoid these fake sick calls.

She could ask for a day off or not go. And nothing is stopping her going another day with friends. \n\nI had awful attendance as a kid, I think high 60s was the best you could expect from me. I\u2019m neurodivergent and the school environment made me stressed and exhausted from being overstimulated. Plus the fact that kids can be very mean. Schools do not fit everyone equally and OP do you judge yourself for finding a solution to get your sons into the routine of school. It is so difficult to break the habit of wanting to leave when anything stressful occurs and I bet they will be more likely to make it through the whole day now out of practice.", "NTA because the issue here is your oldest. She needs to just sit down and relax. I mean, come on. If the point is rewarding the younger once for going to school, she is old enough to see that taking them out of school will undermine the whole thing. So stick to your guns.

Yeah, I'm noping out of that discussion.", "NTA its pointless getting the kids to take off school during the week, the whole point of the reward is to get them to GO to school, it would set a bad example, how doesn't a 20yr old get that?? Shes being selfish, go during the weekend, she'll just have to get over it", "NTA You made a deal with your boys to a achieve a goal. They did. Now it's time for you to hold up your end of the deal. Your daughter needs to grow up and accept that not everything in life will work in her favor. She's asking you to take the boys out of school for a day which kind of kills the point. Why doesn't she ask for a day off from work? If they can take a day from school she can take a day from work. It works both ways.", "NTA\n\nLet her be disappointed. She\u2019s allowed to be disappointed that the younger kids get to do something and she can\u2019t go. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to change your plans.

I worked weekends at age 20 and had to miss out on stuff like this as well. It\u2019s called being an adult. You would not be doing your boys any favors calling them out of school and this trip is supposed to be for them, not their sister. If she wants to go that badly, she can ask for a day off work.

I'm wondering if living at home is making it hard for her to break out of \"teen\" behaviors and fully mature. Might be worth thinking about how to help her \"reset\" a bit more.

This is not something that should be causing them to miss school. Your daughters comment of \"skip one day\" pretty much tells me that you just allow it and don't set any boundaries for them.

In my own personal opinion, your are NTA for the question you asked. In the first place, this entire thing is about making sure your kids go to school. As such, taking them out of school to do something not seriously important (doctors visit, family emergency) would be kind of backwards. It sucks for your daughter, but sometimes work just works out that way. I've been there.

I don\u2019t know if you discussed the trip with her beforehand - if you didn\u2019t, perhaps in the future, you could do so so she can request time off.

I am in college and am missing a bunch of fundamental skills from different subjects due to missing school. If you cannot reliably get your kids to school you have a few options \n\n1. take them to a therapist to try to figure out the deeper meaning of this. (they should see a therapist either way since adhd is heavily linked to other mental illnesses and social issues.) \n\n2. get them both formally diagnosed (if they are not already) and get a IEP or a 504 plan. (again, this should be done anyway) \n\n3. Consider a school catered to kids with learning disabilities where they are taught specifically how to deal with those issues. \n\nI understand how hard it is to have to get kids who hate school to school, trust me. I was the kid that was having screaming matches, having the blankets ripped off of me, having privileges taken away, etc. IT IS NOT A FUN ROUTINE FOR ANYBODY INVOLVED. I ended up having to repeat years and having significant gaps in my learning. In addition to that, I had to be sent to a therapeutic boarding school due to my school avoidance. I do not want your children to have to endure the same thing. You can also set up a plan for when your kids fake sick to go to the nurse, because if the school is aware they will make sure something is done about it. \n\nFinal thoughts: \n\nit\u2019s hard enough to get small children to do anything, let alone do something they don\u2019t enjoy, so I understand being frustrated with people who are saying Y T A. You need to be a united front with your husband on this issue, as well as you have to take into account that maybe 6 is doing this because he sees 9 doing this and is copying because he sees it working. Although I do not exactly approve of the way you are doing things now, I think some people are being a tad harsh in what they are saying and it\u2019s hard to take advice from someone who is belittling or insulting you. \n\nI will also reply to DMs if you want to speak to me about this.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But in this case once the reward has been given one of two things will happen they will resume attending school without needing another reward but the parent is free to do so or the kids go back the way they were before unless another deal is made. That would in this case make the kid the one in control.

I think at the end of the day it boiled down to how the parent handles the situation and how the kids react.
