He ranted about how worried he was about people seeing him with me and me looking taller (basically the same ol rant). I used to suck it up before but this time I said no. He said he wouldn't attend the funeral then. I was shocked I called him insane to miss the funeral over such reason but he seemed upset and said that I was the insane one for refusing to compromise to make it work.\n\n\nWe had a huge fight and he ended up not going.

Your husband is just inadequate.\n\nTake a look at how he treats you when he isn't tripping over his mental Thing about somehow losing his manliness privileges if people see him being shorter than you.

If your partner won't support you in difficult times over something so vain and ridiculous, you should really consider if the marriage is worth staying in. Your husband decided that his vanity and protecting his own toxic image of masculinity and how others could potentially perceive his manhood if you were taller was more important to him than being there for you in a situation where you needed him to be there as an emotional support.

I doubt I'd ever be able to  forgive this and I would never be able to look at him the same way again. I could never imagine doing something so unkind and unloving to a life partner. If he is so insecure about his height, he should do something about it rather than force you to accommodate his insecurity at every turn.

He was also medicated (as in, self medicated with illegal drugs) and not really mentally 'present' or properly awake during the service, then he left right before the gathering we had afterwards because he was tired, so he went home and fell asleep on the couch. I arrived home some hours later and was locked out of the house because he didn't leave the key where I asked him to. I didn't have pockets on my outfit and I didn't own a purse either so I didn't bring my key (which he obviously knew), calling him didn't do diddly squat because he wouldn't wake up due to whatever he took earlier in the day.
