I chose her specifically because I didn\u2019t expect she\u2019d be the type to do that. Hence why this stung. \n\nAnyways, told her I was upset that she used it, and that she needed to replace it tonight. She fought back, but went out and bought some. \n\nShe came back with the garlic cloves separated and peeled instead of a fresh bulb. In my opinion, there is a difference in how the two taste, and I told her I wanted the actual bulb instead of what she got me. She started complaining but went and bought the bulb, which should have ended things. \n\nI had forgiven her and moved on, but apparently she\u2019s been telling our friends a filtered version of the story to make me look bad and apparently mocking me for it, which obviously hurts.

You are a roommate, not a benevolent despot that your roommates live to serve.

You don\u2019t mention how close a grocery store is to your home, so that means she used up her own gas for these two trips if she drove and her own money if she used public transportation.\n\nI doubt her version of the story is very filtered; she probably told them her roommate forced her to go out to the store, twice!, to replace *garlic*. Most people would find that inconvenient and rude. It\u2019s not like she took an important medication you need, borrowed your clothes, etc.\n\nIf you\u2019re this serious about ingredient usage, then you need to start labeling things with your name on them so they won\u2019t be used against your wishes again.\n\nYTA", "So ... she used a little of your garlic.

I was bothered that she didn\u2019t bother to ask me when it would take a two minute text exchange. She just expected I\u2019d be okay with her using something I bought because we lived together, and didn\u2019t think of how it could inconvenience me if I needed to use garlic that night. To be fair to her, she said she\u2019d replace it, but didn\u2019t give any timeline on when that would be. \n\nAnd some important context: my current roommate knows I had a history of shitty roommates that take advantage of my kindness. I chose her specifically because I didn\u2019t expect she\u2019d be the type to do that. Hence why this stung. \n\nAnyways, told her I was upset that she used it, and that she needed to replace it tonight. She fought back, but went out and bought some. \n\nShe came back with the garlic cloves separated and peeled instead of a fresh bulb. In my opinion, there is a difference in how the two taste, and I told her I wanted the actual bulb instead of what she got me. She started complaining but went and bought the bulb, which should have ended things. \n\nI had forgiven her and moved on, but apparently she\u2019s been telling our friends a filtered version of the story to make me look bad and apparently mocking me for it, which obviously hurts. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the villain here, but everyone else does and I feel alone. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
