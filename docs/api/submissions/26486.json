Sorry this is vague as well I don't want to disclose too much personal life.\nMe and my partner are long distance, during my final year of college I decided to fly out to see my partner for a month. During this month, his mother would not leave us alone. He would tell her the plans we had for dates and she would constantly call interrupt and make my partner leave the date for up to 30 mins at a time to call him and take time away from us. This sounds like I'm jealous until I met his mum. \n\nShe didn't even speak to me apart from a 'hello' and only spoke to my partner directly. She would ask him how MY flight was to Canada, I ended up sitting there in silence during the dinner has every time I opened my mouth I'd get blanked and completely spoken over. Until she turned to me and said. \n\"You realise this is a terrible time to be here for { my partners name }\" and my partner laughed and agreed. These dates I had flown out for had been planned for MONTHS, I had left during my finals of my course to be told this to my face. I sat there completely shocked and excused myself to go to my partners room. I called my friend sobbing that the whole time I was at this house I was completely blanked and overlooked. My partner told me I had overreacted and caused a scene over a 'small comment'. I tried to be the bigger person and the next morning I tried again while me and my partner sat on the couch cuddling she was staring right at me and muttering before again removing my partner and I overheard the conversation. \n\"I think it's a waste of money that you're spending on him to be here\" \nAnd a few nasty comments which made me overly uncomfortable and upset. \n\nAfter going back to my partners place after the weekend visit I couldn't forgive that his whole family had started to make jabs at my course, my career, my looks, me as a person. It's damaged the relationship and since coming back to the uk it causes fights due to my partner constantly taking his family's side in how they treat me.. at this point everyone in his family have made comments about me and I can't stand it I adore and love this man but I cannot move past that he will not defend me.. am I the asshole for feeling uncomfortable?", "created_utc": 1694198611, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16dikbc/aita_for_refusing_to_forgive_my_partners_family/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m sorry but you just got a glimpse into the future with this man. The fact that he won\u2019t stand up for you and dismisses your feelings is a clear indicator that he will never go against anything his mom says or does. You need to decide if he\u2019s worth putting up with his family. It won\u2019t get better if he can\u2019t acknowledge your feelings. I used to have in laws that were similar.

Been there. No marriage does not make it better, so don't even try deluding yourself there.
