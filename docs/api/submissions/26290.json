Drives me fucking NUTS when these antisemetic assholes think they better understand Jewish lineage and cultural adoption and start saying I haven't been targetted with racism because it's a rEliGIon. Props to bringing up the ethnic part half-heartedly at least. Hey! Are you Jewish? Shut the fuck up! Shut up! You don't know what you're saying and wikipedia won't help you.\n\nDEFINITION OF RACISM:\n\nprejudice, discrimination, or antagonism by an individual, community, or institution against a person or people on the basis of their membership in a particular racial or **ethnic** group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized.\n\nY'know, kind of like what you're doing right now, you little antisemite you.", "christ alive, read a jistory book.", "What? Fuck Rally! It's all about the tractor pulls, son!", "You sound pretty racist, my guy. You've more in common with the person that the OP is complaining about than the OP.", "OP is not the racist but your comment is absolutely the wrong way to go about it. Most white trash had nothing to do with most advancements we enjoy let alone achieved the likes of what the Mekong, Indus valley, Ngoro crater, Tigris river, etc peoples did.", "Your lack of understanding of racism has developed over a long career of being terminally online and uneducated. \n\nI encourage you to go outside and experience the real world for once.", "Well your argument was so moronic, I didn't feel like engaging. And do tell, how is a country that has elected a black man to the highest office in the land, twice, white supremacist?", "Racism is literally just treating someone differently based on their race. it\u2019s not about how much \u2018power\u2019 you have. for the love of god you\u2019ve been brainwashed", "Yeah..naw. You can be racist to white people just how you can be racist to blacks.", "You're trying to change what racism means to make it so that \"POC can't be racist to white people\" because that would be nice for you.", "You're right, but good luck convincing people of this.", "you\u2019re right and no one is gonna agree bcs \u201cthat hurts my white feelings\u201d", "If a white person is in China for example and faces racism - who has the power dynamic?", "The \"power dynamic\" argument is so damn dumb.

That\u2019d be an incredibly stupid way of thinking so I\u2019m sorry if you took it that way. \n\nThe same thing goes the other way for what I said. Racists towards non white people can live shitty sad lives without gas furnaces, clothes dryers, traffic lights, modern toilets, colour TV, contraceptive pills, photography, lots of modern medecine, and many other things people heavily rely on. They can also figuratively speaking \u201ceat the fries or don\u2019t eat them\u201d and it\u2019s also fucking annoying to hear racist comments out of them. I didn\u2019t say that in the original comment because it had nothing to do with this situation. This situation wasn\u2019t a white person constantly complaining about things that were made by non-white people.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason to say that all inventions by white people don\u2019t deserve to be credited to white people because the people that came before them weren\u2019t white and contributed, and there\u2019s no reason to say that all inventions by non-white people don\u2019t deserve to be contributed to non-white people because the people that came before them were white and contributed. I wouldn\u2019t attribute the invention of the artificial heart machine to a white person who paved the way for it to happen when a Hispanic person invented it. I wouldn\u2019t attribute the invention of insulin to a non-white person who paved the way for it because a white person invented it.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the wrong way to go about it saying that people are hypocrites for complaining about the inventions of a kind of people and then continuing to enjoy those inventions or creations. That goes for literally anyone. I would say thinking that I should have to clarify that the opposite situation is also true, and that saying white people have done things doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m saying non-white people haven\u2019t done things is the wrong way to go about it. That way of thinking reminds me of the argument racists made saying that the Black Lives Matter movement meant that white lives didn\u2019t matter. Saying a good thing about one group of people in a situation doesn\u2019t mean you automatically hate the other group of people or wouldn\u2019t say the same good thing about them.", "Your comment reeks of racism.", "whole post seems like a racist dogwhistle ngl", ">white trash\n\nPut another color in there, say it again.\n\nI dare you.", "Says \"The Goon Wolf\".

The same way a dude who grows up poor and struggling still has male privilege. Privilege doesn't mean your life is going to be sunshine and roses and free of bad shit, it just means X quality (skin colour, gender, sexual orientation etc) won't make your life harder.\n\nPOC can still be discriminatory to white people, but that's all it is, discrimination.
