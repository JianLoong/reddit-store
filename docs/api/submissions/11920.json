The shower is tomorrow. \n\nI found out today from another coworker that the woman who\u2019s making the food will be charging $20/bowl and they need to be pre-ordered right away so she knows how many to make, and by \u201cI found out today\u201d I mean I literally found out right now at 8pm. Apparently this was decided a few days ago because her family has fallen on some hard times so she decided to make the bowls as a fundraiser. \n\nI have not said yes or no. Honestly I feel a little selfishly annoyed that I have to pre order and pay for food at my own shower, and I don\u2019t even know if I can order this late in the game when I only just found out. I get that it\u2019s rough times right now but I can\u2019t justify $20 for a burrito bowl even if it is for a good cause? If it matters, there will be other food there (it was an appetizer/snack kind of shower other than the bowls). \n\nSo folks of reddit WIBTA if I declined buying the food my coworker made for my shower, or do I suck it up and shell out the $20 (they ARE delicious)\n\nEdit to add: \n1) the coworker is only making bowls for people who pre ordered/prepaid themselves.

You baby shower is supposed to be for the benefit of you and your child. It's not supposed to be a fund raiser for her. Her idea may be the tackiest thing I've heard of this week.", "NTA. Your work is throwing this party to celebrate your incoming baby and she\u2019s capitalizing on it. I\u2019m all for helping the needy but I personally find this very distasteful (despite how tasty the bowls might actually be) especially at $20 a pop. No thanks.", "NTA, it\u2019s YOUR shower You are going to be taking on the expenses of a baby. It sounds like your coworker is trying to profit off of your life milestone.", "NTA, nope, no matter how delicious it is, no matter if i could afford it, i won\u2019t pay when i\u2019m being put in such a spot.", "NTA. NTA, definitely.\n\nI just DON'T UNDERSTAND how people are so comfortable making everything about themselves. This is YOUR baby shower, not a fundraising opportunity for her.\n\nHow can anyone think that it's okay to price each TACO BOWl for $20? It's honestly just embarrassing and tacky. I'm literally embarrassed and I'm not even there lmao.\n\nIf I were you, I would first try to have a mature conversation with her and very clearly tell her that no, you will not be paying $20 per bowl. You mentioned in another comment that there are 10 people coming. Even if she is cooking, $20 per bowl is a crazy amount. Are you ready to shell out $200 on taco bowls?\n\nYou also said that there will be other food, so please reconsider and decide if you even need taco bowls. There are many other places you can get taco bowls if that is a specific food you want.", "NTA. The audacity of her to use your baby shower to benefit herself. Surely coworkers are spending to celebrate you and your baby. She\u2019s double the AH for fundraising on top of that. And potentially gipping you of the gifts your coworkers wanted to buy you not intending to spend double that day. \nThis being decided a couple days ago is gross. Whoever is leading the shower planning should\u2019ve put a hard NO on that.\nIf Coworkers want to do something to help her in her hard times\u2026they do that separately. And by giving her money without her justifying it by selling wayy overpriced burritos bowls. I\u2019m wondering if your coworkers haven\u2019t already done something to help out bc of her behavior or if they already have and she\u2019s double dipping. \n\nAt this point, give her $20 and not eat a burrito bowl. Especially sense she\u2019s so hard up that she would take advantage of your work baby shower and make it about her. And surely she\u2019s bought the ingredients before 8pm tonight. So the short notice is even crappier. \nWow, this chick!", "NTA\n\nYour coworker might be.\n\nIf I'm being honest the only way I'd be cool with this is if the money after cost of ingredients went directly to you to get stuff for the kid.", "INFO: how many people in your office attending this shower?", "She put you in a tough spot, usurping your event, and not giving people notice that she\u2019s only do it for pay in the first place.\n\nShe\u2019s an AH for sure.\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019d be an AH if you didn\u2019t pay (and hence not eat one), but the optics in an office place are going to look bad, particularly since this event is for you. Think less about \u201casshole\u201d and more about \u201cI have to work with these people for how many years?\u201d\n\nNTA, but choose carefully, with consideration of the consequences.", "NTA and if you need an excuse, blame pregnancy nausea", ">If it matters, there will be other food there\n\nYes, this matters. Your coworker is welcome to try and exploit whomever she'd like, but you're NTA for not wanting to go along with it.", "WNBTA and I would share your annoyance but it might be best to just shell out the money, considering you loved the food so much and it's probably best to have as much and different food available for guests.", "This is a situation where you have to decide which one is worse. Paying 20 dollars or the blow back you know she's going to cause in your work environment. NTA", "NAH\n\nWhile I think it's tacky to try to turn someone's baby shower into a personal fundraiser, I can't say it is asshole behavior. I can understand her asking for enough to cover costs, but this is way beyond that. I wouldn't fault you for not buying one especially since this is so last minute and it's YOUR baby shower. I wouldn't buy one either.", "Nta but I do kind of see where your co worker is coming from asking for payment, although  this is a baby shower not a work function your co workers (and some of whom you've said yourself you arnt close to) shouldn't have to pay for the cost of food for others to share, \n\nClose friends sure that's different they love you and are excited for you. \nbut to be honest when its was brought up at work as an idea it was probably decided for the co worker by someone else  that it would be her contribution and not her own choice then fair enough food costs money and your co worker shouldn't have to bear the financial burden because your boss thought it was a good idea.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
