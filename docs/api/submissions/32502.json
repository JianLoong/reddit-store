This incident happened last month and it's still causing issues.\n\nA couple of weeks before Thanksgiving, we got the news that several young nieces and nephews would be coming. The last time my wife and I have seen any of them was when they were still in diapers, so we were excited to see them.\n\nFast forward to a couple of days before Thanksgiving, we get a call from my mother wanting to talk about Thanksgiving dinner. She was telling us how she was planning on introducing my wife and I as friends (\"This is your aunt's friend, \\[name\\]\"). We both looked at each other in discomfort and I asked my mom why and she said \"Well because they're still so young and they don't need any confusion right now.\" \n\nI suggested that she could introduce us properly and if the kids questioned it, she could explain to them later or use the \"I'll tell you when you're older\" thing. My wife and I would've been completely fine with that. But no, she didn't want any middle ground in it, she was sticking to her guns (her actual words). \n\nTHEN she asked us what the big deal was and we told her that we're married, not just friends. My wife added that introducing us as friends would be disrespectful to our marriage and to us. We deserve to be recognized as a couple just like every other couple that was there. We would have to interact with each other differently and act like we're friends when we're clearly much more than that. And the fact that she was *telling* us that she was in fact doing it instead of *asking* us how we felt about it added to our discomfort. This didn't convince her and she was still bent on \"protecting\" the kids. \n\nSo my wife calmly said that if we can't be treated equally, then we wouldn't be coming. I agreed to that and took my wife's side. None of this was said to my mother in a rude way. This made my mother furious. She ranted about how she bought enough food for everyone including us and how she was cooking our favorite sides. I told her that it was all pointless if she was just going to drive an invisible wedge between us the whole time, and that I was sorry but I was taking my wife's side on this. Well...she hung up. \n\nWe had our own Thanksgiving with my wife's family and a LOT of our friends. But since then, my mother has not let it go. Blowing up my phone constantly, guilting me, talking about how everyone asked where my wife and I were - to which she said that we bailed last second. It is December now and she'll mention it at least twice a day. Now I'm starting to think that I was in the wrong and that I should've talked to my wife about it but I didn't know what else to do.

Let\u2019s say for the sake of argument that your mom is carefully balancing wanting to support you and your wife, and also hold the family together amid conservative mindsets. As much as I look down on homophobes, I can understand where family dynamics can get complicated and people do their best to keep it together.\n\nThat being said, your wife is your family, and therefore your mom\u2019s family as well. Her continued behavior of squarely placing the blame on you and refusing to look at how her actions contributed to the problem is deeply concerning.

My parents were going to decide when I was ready to receive that information and the same should be done with your nieces and nephews\u2019 parents; at minimum they should\u2019ve been involved with the conversation instead of demands of \u201cmy way or the high way\u201d that both you and your mom had since it is their children this will effect and who will most likely be dealing with any questions/confusion this revelation causes.", "TA innocent kids don\u2019t need to be exposed to this kind of bull when young", "Oh come on. You know you did the right thing. Are you really gonna let your mom introduce your wife as your \u201croommate\u201d the rest of her life? If you are then yes YTA and your wife deserves better.", "It sure is outlandish but goddammit if bigots won't try to over complicate it.  I came out as trans to my family 3 years ago. My family didn't handle it very well, tried making excuses about explaining things to the kids. That lasted until I pointed out they were going to have a way harder time explaining why I have boobs suddenly.  The final straw was my sisters not bringing my nieces and nephews to my wedding because it was \"too confusing\".  \n\nI had been with my now wife for 13 years at that point. Longer than any of these kids had been alive. They've only known my wife as an Aunt their entire lives, but because it was a lesbian wedding now it was too confusing somehow. They simply just couldn't figure out how to explain why our love was bad now when they always pestered us about marriage and kids before.  Meanwhile, all my friends had a simple 10 minute conversation with their kids and that was the end of it.", "It made me so excited to see you use the term Niblings. I've been using it since I was young and am always trying to get other people to use it, but most people don't even believe that it's a real word despite being so similar to Sibling/siblings. \ud83d\ude05", "My mom had gay & lesbian friends in the 80s and her brother was a gay man. It was never excused or hidden from me, it was just a fact that was either not addressed (because they didn't address same sex couples either) or if questions came up they would explain in ways that were appropriate. Believing in 2023 that children need to be protected from the gays is absolutely bonkers. NTA", "^^^ This is the only answer you need.   100% NTA.  In fact,  you and your wife rock.", "All of this. NTA, OP. Don\u2019t let your mother guilt trip you into letting her treat you and your wife as lesser than.", "This. All this. Your mother, I hate to say, is being outright homophobic. Standing up to homophobia is never an asshole move.\n\nNTA", "Downvoting you for calling it latent. There's nothing latent about it.", "Are we really going to pretend the right-wing is just as accepting as same sex couples? Lol.", "Are all the couples pretending to be friends?", "Spoken like a true straight white man.", "Right? And if the rest of the family agrees with the mom, then it looks like they aren't family anymore", "There is this little story i like to tell. We were invited to the drink before the reception at the the wedding of two guys related to my BIL. My niece was 3 at the time. She asked one of the two guys: \n\n\"so you are a boy and you just married another boy?\"\n\n\"Yes\"\n\nEverybody was expecting a follow up question and there it was:\n\n\"May I eat some crisps?\"", "Ha! As a very gay lady married to another very gay lady, this cracked me UP. (Also, THANK YOU for the clear, inclusive, and deeply loving way of validating and normalizing many kinds of families.)", "i love the term niblings! it makes so much sense and shortens having to say \"nieces and nephews\" every time you want to reference your siblings kids. my phone still doesn't realize its a real word, always trying to correct it to nibblings which makes me feel weird lol it's a real word, i swear!", "Ha, it reminds me of this sketch on a comedy TV show about Indian people living in the UK. \n\nSon: Mum, Dad, do you remember Michael?  \nMother: Of course, he's your best friend! You're always locked in your room together  \nFather: You have such a great friendship. We love Michael!  \nSon: Well, Michael isn't just my friend, he's my boyfriend, we're in love  \nMother: Why are you doing this to us? Why couldn't you find yourself a nice Indian boy???", "True, best to just state the facts and keep it simple", "It is for ignorant people.", "I mean\u2026 yeah. I agree COMPLETELY", "My favorite take on that is on one of those tumblr or whatever screenshots that gets forwarded around.  \"My nephew asked me, 'Uncle Mike? Why don't you have a wife?' I said, 'I'm gay'.  'What's that?' he asked.  I said 'I like boys, not girls.'  He thought about this for a few seconds and asked, 'So how come you don't have a husband?'\"", "She\u2019s not wrong though", "So you're a homophone with LGBQT+ family. How awful for them.", "My daughter felt the same for several years after she learned how babies enter the world! She also watched me struggle mentally after her little brother was born, so she maintained a very firm \"no kids\" position for a few years. She's relaxed about it now and realizes that she adores kids and definitely wants her own, but she's still considering adoption. She's 9 lol.", "I do that sometimes when the kid is about to have a fit. They get so baffled that they forget what annoyed them. All calm and peace.", "So, how do you come out AFTER your family gets to know your partner?  \"Mom, dad?  I have something to say.  You know that girl that I started dating a couple years back and we're a couple and everything?  Yeah, it turns out that she's gay.\"", "I do wish it didn\u2019t have to be such a big thing for people. There is no expectation to come out as hetero. It would be way weird to sit your parents down to tell them you\u2019re straight, but I think it\u2019s equally bizarre that people are made to feel they have to actively declare their sexuality at some point if they are anything but hetero. Needing to make an announcement or proclamation about who you have, or don\u2019t have, sex with is just so strange. Hopefully we\u2019ll see this shift in our lifetimes, which it does feel like is happening within a lot of families and is always encouraging to see and hear about.", "That's similar to what my reaction was, my mom said I was like \"he put WHAT? In WHERE?\" Although I didn't vomit lmfao", "That Is SO God Dam Frigging Hilarious! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "usually, they play the \"close friend\" card... how do you not understand that? You know that you can be in a relationship with someone for years and if you don't tell people, they won't know!!! MIND-BLOWING!!!", "Awww \u2764\ufe0f I love that!", "My daughter and I were having a conversation about her son when he was a baby and if he was gay we would love him anyways. Well, of course, absolutely! So a couple of years later she needed to talk to me. She is gay, and I think that was to see how we felt about it! She had known since she was young but tried to 'change'. Can you imagine? She's a happy confident young woman, and my grandson and his friends have never batted an eye about it. People don't give kids enough credit. They handle things better than a lot of adults.", "Yup all my friends had 1 or 2 siblings, so after we learnt about it, they all took great pleasure in ripping the absolute piss out of me bc I had 5 siblings so my parents had done it far more than their parents...remember not being able to look at them for a few days...it was a difficult time for me...lol", "True, he means he never has to give birth even though he wants to have kids. And you probably mean cis. Being straight has nothing to do with it.", "Knowingly? Sure.\n\nAccidentally, thinking they are something else? While helping daughter clean her room when asked? Nah.", "Why don't I get to identify as straight? Not being facetious.", "You do, but being straight has nothing to do with having kids. People of all orientations can have kids. And I mentioned trans in my comment, so I assumed you were going off that. Trans isn\u2019t an orientation, but straight is. \n\nIf I had said my son was gay, then you being straight would be relevant. As it is, you being straight has nothing to do with the comment I made."]}
