This incident happened last month and it's still causing issues.\n\nA couple of weeks before Thanksgiving, we got the news that several young nieces and nephews would be coming. The last time my wife and I have seen any of them was when they were still in diapers, so we were excited to see them.\n\nFast forward to a couple of days before Thanksgiving, we get a call from my mother wanting to talk about Thanksgiving dinner. She was telling us how she was planning on introducing my wife and I as friends (\"This is your aunt's friend, \\[name\\]\"). We both looked at each other in discomfort and I asked my mom why and she said \"Well because they're still so young and they don't need any confusion right now.\" \n\nI suggested that she could introduce us properly and if the kids questioned it, she could explain to them later or use the \"I'll tell you when you're older\" thing. My wife and I would've been completely fine with that. But no, she didn't want any middle ground in it, she was sticking to her guns (her actual words). \n\nTHEN she asked us what the big deal was and we told her that we're married, not just friends. My wife added that introducing us as friends would be disrespectful to our marriage and to us. We deserve to be recognized as a couple just like every other couple that was there. We would have to interact with each other differently and act like we're friends when we're clearly much more than that. And the fact that she was *telling* us that she was in fact doing it instead of *asking* us how we felt about it added to our discomfort. This didn't convince her and she was still bent on \"protecting\" the kids. \n\nSo my wife calmly said that if we can't be treated equally, then we wouldn't be coming. I agreed to that and took my wife's side. None of this was said to my mother in a rude way. This made my mother furious. She ranted about how she bought enough food for everyone including us and how she was cooking our favorite sides. I told her that it was all pointless if she was just going to drive an invisible wedge between us the whole time, and that I was sorry but I was taking my wife's side on this. Well...she hung up. \n\nWe had our own Thanksgiving with my wife's family and a LOT of our friends. But since then, my mother has not let it go. Blowing up my phone constantly, guilting me, talking about how everyone asked where my wife and I were - to which she said that we bailed last second. It is December now and she'll mention it at least twice a day. Now I'm starting to think that I was in the wrong and that I should've talked to my wife about it but I didn't know what else to do.

Let\u2019s say for the sake of argument that your mom is carefully balancing wanting to support you and your wife, and also hold the family together amid conservative mindsets. As much as I look down on homophobes, I can understand where family dynamics can get complicated and people do their best to keep it together.\n\nThat being said, your wife is your family, and therefore your mom\u2019s family as well. Her continued behavior of squarely placing the blame on you and refusing to look at how her actions contributed to the problem is deeply concerning. I think it\u2019s fair to hypothesize that deep down, your mom knows she did the wrong thing by disrespecting her own family (you and your wife), and chose the coward\u2019s way out with the whole \u201cfriends\u201d thing.
