I\u2019ve gone with her to doctor appointments when her partner couldn\u2019t make it, I\u2019ve helped her out with baby essentials, and I\u2019ve been a shoulder for her to cry on. Our mother isn\u2019t in the picture, so I played the part during her pregnancy. Anytime labor and delivery was brought up I was always included in the plan. She told me multiple times that she was scared to go into labor, and she wanted someone with her who knew what was going on.  \n\nFast forward to Saturday when I get a text from my sister\u2019s partner in our family group chat announcing that my sister given birth. At first I was worried because I thought maybe she had to have an emergency c-section or something since no one called me. Then I read the text that said that my sister had given birth early in the morning after being in labor for sixteen hours. This confused me, but I didn\u2019t say anything. \n\nMy husband and I went to visit my sister in the hospital to see the baby, and bring her dinner. I asked my sister how she was feeling, how was the birth, and all the other things people ask after someone gives birth. After seeing my niece and talking with my sister for a while I asked her if there was a reason she didn\u2019t call me when she went into labor. She told me that she didn\u2019t think of it at the time, \u201ceverything was moving too fast.\u201d I made a joke asking her how being in labor for sixteen hours is too fast to call me. \n\nMy sister\u2019s partner took offense to this. They told me that my sister didn\u2019t have to call me. I told them that if they weren\u2019t going to tell me when my sister was in labor then she shouldn\u2019t have told me that she wanted me at the birth. I was under the impression that I was going to see my niece be born, and it isn\u2019t fair to take that away without a heads up. Things got awkward, so my husband and I left. Later I got a text from my sister\u2019s partner telling me that I need to apologize to my sister because I was out of line. I don\u2019t think I was out of line for asking a question, neither does my husband, but my sister and her partner are making me feel like I\u2019m an asshole.", "created_utc": 1681790949, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12q9u80/aita_for_being_upset_with_my_my_sister_for_not/", "score": 472, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I get that you feel protective/parental/whatever, but this isn\u2019t about *you.* It was your sister giving birth and it went how she wanted. You\u2019re being selfish to try and make it about you", "You brought this up while your sister was still in the hospital?\n\nYou absolutely have the right to feel disappointed but .... you clearly have no consideration for others. Your sister & her new born were the only people that mattered in that room. She just went through 16 hours of labor but you wanted her to be concerned about you? Do you have children? \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nC'mon now, she just gave birth and you're making things about you? Not cool. She had her spouse there, and it seems in the moment for her that was good enough. I can see you are disappointed, but this is one of those situations you should simply let slide. She doesn't need more stress right now, post partum is no joke.", "YTA \n\nSorry but you were out of line on this one. Your sister made a promise, yes, but when the time came, it turned out that she wanted her partner there and that's her choice. 16 hours or 6 minutes, it doesn't matter. Things can seem to go by pretty fast and who are you to judge?\n\nGiving birth is a highly personal, emotional and special time and this was her time to choose who would be there for it. She chose her partner and you need to gracefully bow out. Apologize to her privately and to her partner.", "YTA, in a big way.  Your sisters labor and delivery was not about you, period.  Your role was as a support person, which means being there if she wants you and also being supportive if she decides she does not.\n\nYou are being completely self-absorbed and owe your sister a huge apology.", "YTA. Consent to something can be taken away at any time. She does not need to give you a reason for not having you at the birth. \n\nIt's highly likely her partner was supportive and that she had very supportive nurses. \n\nYou can be disappointed sure you looked forward to this. But in the end it's about the person birthing the baby whether it's a vaginal or C-section who they want there goes. Apologize to your sister. Be happy she and her baby are happy and healthy.", "YTA\n\nMaking her birth giving about you. Common now she doesn't have to call you and based on your response I'm not surprised she didn't. \n\nPerhaps she was scared initially and was happy you were willing to be there for her. Perhaps it all happened way too fast for her and she didn't have the mental capability to call and have you around. \n\nEither way she doesn't need a reason, nor does she owe you an explanation. It's her decision in a time where her life is about to change forever.\n\nIt's not your day.", "YTA. It\u2019s not like she was just at the spa for 16 hours\u2026 she was in labor", "YTA\n\nSad to miss it? Sure. Had a right to be there? No.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t fair to take that away without a heads up\u201d - nope, you\u2019re dreaming. You can wish she\u2019d given you a heads up, but who your sister decided to have at the birth of her child isn\u2019t a question of fairness.\n\nBonus AH points for bringing it up while they were still in the hospital, presumably exhausted and still in pain, and making a moment that should have been about your niece about you.", "YTA. At any time she can change her mind on who is there. It is an intimate moment, and it looks like she wanted to share that with just her partner in the end. Also you should have waited for her to heal before saying how it hurt. She doesn\u2019t need stress. I hope you make it right with her.", "YTA. She obviously wanted you to be a part of this, but in the moment she went into labor, what her body and mind need in the moment -- or the 16 hours of moments-- is all that matters. Why wouldn't you have told her ahead of time that if her needs during labor don't include you, that's just fine? I would have told that to a person I was supporting on, like, day one. Yet, you seem like the kind of person who not only didn't think to tell her that, but actually wants the opposite???? I never would have felt slighted if my sister felt the need to focus on things other than me during labor, no matter how much I'd invested in supporting her. You're being pretty transactional here.", "YTA\nYou should feel glad that both her partner and the hospital made her feel secure enough to not need one more person in that room, where you would be in the way and offer nothing of practical value. \n\nYou should see her needing you there as a sign that something was wrong and her being able to focus on her actual task instead of having you as yet one more worry and distraction as a blessing. \n\nYou should congratulate your sister and the facility and partner who helped her. \n\nInstead you chose a moment when her body chemistry is so fucked up that women literally go postpartum and die to make this about you and your disappointments. \n\nShame on you.", "Bro YTA, it's like you expected something in return for what you got, when you are going through all that pain, you don't say \"No wait stop, call my sister first\"", "YTA. \nYou're not the husband. She didn't choose you to be in there while she gives birth. End of the discussion. And how sweet of you to ask irrelevant questions right after she gave birth and is healing. \ud83e\udd70 \nWhen she went into labour her first thought wasn't \"oh I should call my sister\"\nGrow up. Go apologize to her or you'll lose your sister forever.", "YTA. There\u2019s a time and a place for everything confrontation. And for your confrontation, it was not the right time, or the right place. Moreover, you\u2019re upset over nothing. This is not a reason to be upset with your sister.", "YTA she doesn't owe you anything and it's free to invite to the labor whoever she wants", "YTA, sorry! I do understand your feelings, but as a rule of thumb, when it comes to stuff like this, the mom is allowed to be stingy! Now, don\u2019t take it so personally, and enjoy spoiling sister and baby!", "YTA. I sympathize with you, but she was in labor, she had other priorities. Apologize, take the L and move on to spoiling that baby!", "YTA. Your sister just gave birth.  It wasn't the time or the place to air your rather selfish grievances.", "Soft YTA. Chill. Sometimes these things don't work out, especially in this situation. Also, arranging for a call tree can improve communications in times of urgency.", "YTA - Quit making it about you and be happy for your sister.", "Birth plans go out the window all the time. Once you're in labor, all bets are off, and the stars of the show are mom & baby, not the supporting cast.\n\nYTA", "YTA.\nMaybe when it came down to it, she realized she actually didn\u2019t want her labor to be a spectator sport.\n\nStop making your disappointment their problem. Her labor, her rules and there\u2019s no \u201cunfair\u201d about it.", "Soft YTA. I understand it was disappointing for you to have missed out with no warning, and if she changed her mind before going into labour she probably should have let you know out of courtesy. But if she changed her mind while in labour, there\u2019s nothing to say on it. Either way, it\u2019s her choice and she can change that choice at any time. Try to focus on the fact that both are happy and healthy! It\u2019s a beautiful thing for birth to go well. Apologise and move on with your sister and new niece", "You should be happy that your sister had a safe delivery and that you have a new niece, rather than being upset and disappointed that you weren\u2019t in the room when it happened. You need to get over yourself. Yes, YTA.", "YTA. I get that you were sad and disappointed, I would have been too. But sometimes as an adult, you have to figure out how to manage feelings like that on your own. \n\nLike, what\u2019s the best case scenario you can expect when you bring up something like this? Your sister can\u2019t rewind her birth to include you, so\u2026she feels crappy about it? Why would you want her to feel crappy when she\u2019s just given birth? What do you get out of that?", "NAH\nShe had other prios when she was in labor.\nAnd she has a partner, so I assume he wanted to be the one holding her hand, that's nothing a mother (sister) should do as first choice.\n\nShe could have told you to be in hospital in general, but yeah. She was busy.", "YTA. I am guessing you haven\u2019t been through childbirth yourself. 16 hours of labor is no party, and the focus is a healthy baby and mother and not \u201cis the gang all here?\u201d\n\nYes you might have been your sisters sounding board for all her stressing and planning, but maybe she hadn\u2019t considered what her partner was wanting [yet]. Maybe they just wanted the room to themselves, there\u2019s already so much commotion with all of the hospital staff and doctors. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your feelings are hurt, and you\u2019re allowed to feel that. But sharing that at the hospital was the wrong time. You\u2019re making it about you. Being supportive and helping your sister with baby essentials, and stepping up in place of your mother is all wonderful. It does not entitle you to be in the room, nor should you feel resentment for not getting the call while she was in labor. Plan or no plan. Watch any movie, talk to any parents; the birth plan often goes out the window once you realize it\u2019s go time.\n\nNow: go to the store, go prepare a reheatable meal that your sister and her partner can gobble between delirious naps. (No box meal kits. No one can cook safely with their first newborn screaming \ud83d\ude09)\n\nWhile that\u2019s cooking, write an \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d letter. Explain what you\u2019re feeling, apologize for your lack of tact for the time and way you expressed your disappointment, and congratulate her on her baby.\n\nYou missed a moment. It sucks. it\u2019s gone. No point in letting that be a thorn in anyone\u2019s side. You have a lifetime to be an aunt, so go be a better aunt, than the sister you have been over this moment. There\u2019s still so many glorious baby moments to take in, let go of your ego, and make the apology.", "YTA this was her first kid we both know 16hrs in labor isn\u2019t just sitting around shooting the breeze it\u2019s constant check ins by nurses and doctors pain anxiety and god knows what else she was feeling . Yes she didn\u2019t stop to call you but it didn\u2019t change the fact that they are both healthy. You missed the birth but you have a lifetime with them don\u2019t ruin it because of this. You asked she answered move on", "YTA\n\nOh no, you weren't the main character during the 16 hours your sister was in labor. You seriously made your hospital visit to see your sister's baby about making her feel guilty for not telling you she was in labor. Whew! You sound really self centered and immature.", "I'm sorry? Did you two have a plan that she would call you so you could be there? If I'd labored 16 hours, (and I am grateful that I didn't have to,) the last thing I would have been thinking about is, \"Is my sister OK with this?\" Labor was tiring even though it wasn't a bad experience for me. I wanted a nap and some peace and quiet and a pizza after I woke up. I wasn't focused on  anyone but the baby and my husband, if I'm honest.\n\nI was there when my sister gave birth because we were together when she went into labor and I was her Lamaze partner way back then anyway. Her husband was away in the military. That's the only way I would have expected her to call me.\n\nSo, considering that this was your sister's ***labor,*** YTA. I would not have thought to call you either.", "Yta", "YTA; do you remember what labor is like???? Someone could have come into my room with an airhorn and a neon sign telling me to call someone and I wouldn\u2019t have noticed because I was in so much pain during labor. \n\nConfronting her about it right after she went through 16 hrs of labor, was reeeeeeally shitty no matter how disappointed you felt. I would have kicked a person out if they started saying something like that while I was still in the hospital. Apologize to your sister before you permanently damage your relationship", "YTA. SHE was the one giving birth, so SHE gets to decide who is there and who is notified. That includes changing her mind last minute.", "YTA Her giving birth was not about you. She didn't \"take\" anything away from you, she did what she felt was best for her at the time and that ended up being just having her partner there. You are allowed to be disappointed, it's ok to have feelings, but you never ever should've voiced that to her at all. You 100% owe her an apology. Maybe make them a nice casserole or something and drop it off with a sincere apology for being selfish.", "YTA\n\nI'm sure she told you the truth - things were moving too fast and she didn't think to call.\n\nThe only people who should be at the birth are the people who made the baby, imho.\n\nYou should not have scolded your sister while she was still in the hospital, or ever.  You are grown woman dealing with a girl.  You should have swallowed your hurt feelings, vented to your husband in private and let it go.\n\nI hope you can work things out with your sister.\n\nGood Luck", "YTA.\n\nShe was in labor. After getting to the hospital, she was probably drugged to the gils. Being so young, it's probably her first, so that goes double. \n\nEven if she wasn't drugged up, she was in labor ffs. Probably too much pain to think straight.", "YTA.", "YTA: I been in labour for 3 days before and all that was on my mind was nothing I had to walk walk around if I laid down it was painful. \n\nI couldn\u2019t even focus on tv to watch a show. So the last thing on her mind was you she was fine. \n\nIt\u2019s not a showroom it\u2019s your sister most vulnerable she ever going to be and instead of being supportive you made it about yourself.", "YTA and your self centred attitude is probably the reason why you were not called. Also it's incredibly selfish and narcissistic to scold your sister about this when she's just had a baby! I'm sure that your attitude stole some of the joy from the occasion. Surely you would know how exhausting it is to give birth- why would you do that to your own sister?", "YTA you know, I was with you and understanding your feelings right up until \"it isn't fair to take away me seeing my niece born without heads up\" like what??? Apologize for stressing your sister out *while she was still recovering in the hospital* and do not bring this up again. If there wan an opportunity to discuss your feelings over this, you just destroyed that opportunity forever with your timing. I'm beginning to see why you got left out. Sounds like you would have made the birth about you instead of your sister...kinda like how you just managed to do that without even being invited for the birth.", "YTA\n\nWhy in gods name would you bring that up in hospital after she\u2019s just had a baby?! Are you high?  You could have easily asked a few days after when she\u2019s settled at home but you thought that was the appropriate time? I can only assume (because I don\u2019t know) that you haven\u2019t given birth before because I would hope if you had you would realise how shitty what you did is.\n\nEDIT: just read that you do have kids. That makes this so much worse in my opinion.", "YTA - Your sister does not owe anything to you. Birth can be traumatic or she just wanted her and her partner. I didn't want other family there which offended my mother in law. I just wanted my husband.", ">I made a joke asking her how being in labor for sixteen hours is too fast to call me. \n\nCome on, it clearly wasn't a joke. \n\nYTA", "4 kids, never did I once call my sisters to tell them I was i labor. \n\nAnd I think I know why she did not call you.\nIf you were nit asked on a set call to be there, you would worry and ask for updates... no one need that during  labor.\n\nYTA", "NAH, as much as her birth wasn't about you and all that business, it's reasonable to feel some kind of way about how this went and ask her why she deviated from a plan you guys went over multiple times. Like, idk why people think asking her was inappropriate? It's an entirely valid question when you were such a major part of the game plan and support system leading up to it. If she feels bad now or guilt tripped because you wanted to know basic information, that's her problem, just like your feelings about being left out are yours.", "[deleted]", "NTA.\n\nShe used you. Used your love and support and kindness, and then ignored you.\n\nThen rather than either tell you herself or get her partner to tell you at any time during the 16 hours they had the chance to, they just couldn\u2019t be bothered.\n\nSo now you know where you stand, remember it.\n\nWhen they come crawling to you for help, for babysitting, for advice - ignore them.\n\nThey had ample opportunity to say \u201cHey OP, thank you for everything you have done, but we\u2019ve decided that it is just going to be mom and partner in the room, will let you know when the baby is born\u201d", "I\u2019m gonna say NAH. It doesn\u2019t sound like you badgered her, just asked a question. Here\u2019s the thing, you\u2019re right, 16 hours was absolutely enough time to have someone call you if they wanted to. You didn\u2019t say your sister got upset, you said her partner did. Maybe the partner didn\u2019t want to share the moment and asking in front of them may have put your sis on the spot.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re shocked at this turn of events, and probably hurt which should be 100% understandable. Your sister is very lucky that you would\u2019ve been there for her, so many people don\u2019t have that. Take comfort n your good intentions. I\u2019m hoping this situation doesn\u2019t sting for too long and I hope it doesn\u2019t interfere with your relationship.", "ESH - As others have said the time to bring this up wasn\u2019t at the hospital and she had her husband who has probably more to do with being at the birth than her sister.\n\nThat said, she was happy to lean on you extensively up till that point and so not even getting her partner to let you know she was in Labour or let you know first that the baby was born, was pretty poor behaviour.  You don\u2019t treat someone as a close companion throughout and downgrade them at the last minute to the same as everyone else and not expect them to be hurt and confused.", "NAH: if it's her first child she may have been frantic and it wasn't the first thing on her mind.  And then emotions are running high there is a lot of stress and it feels like you're accusing them even though you weren't. \n\nFor your part it's a reasonable question and it's very sweet that you were disappointed.  I have a big sister who cares for me and it's such a wonderful blessing.  There is no one like a big sister.  Not everyone has a sister who gives a shit and she should appreciate it. \n\nI think you two will make up.  \n\nDo not apologize.  But do sit down and tell her how you feel once she gets home.", "NTA\n\nThe commenters are the ones that are so out of touch with reality, I don't think the sister is an AH either but how are none of you noticing how quick the husband was to take offence? Seems weird to me. Do none of yall have families? OP isn't owed a chance to be in the room but 16 hours went by and the husband didn't even send a text, I wonder why. Something feels off.", "Did your sister ask for your help when she was pregnant? Or may it be the case that you forced yourself on her? \nMaybe that could be the reason why she didn't think  of you or want you around her when she went into labour. Maybe she just wanted that this experience would  be something only about her, her husband and the baby and not a next big-sister-moment.\n\nSoft  N TA because you should not have asked her why you could not be with her shortly after she gave birth. In this Moment everyone should only be happy, that the mother and the Baby are fine and everything went well.\n\n But NTA for feeling hurt and used", "NTA - Pregnancy and birth is a mess. You were excited, she was in labor, and at the moment, its hard to be in control of much of anything. She was probably just trying not to pass out most of the time.

Considering her sister wanted her involved VERY significantly until that point, the first thing that came to my mind was that the partner said to the sister that they didn't want OP there. Which is fine but either of them could have notified her of that before she went into labour (I feel like it's something you plan based on your needs prior to the event - and it's a responsibility for OP as well to be there at any time to support her sister through labour and childbirth). Again, I value communication highly after I was told by others when I was in my 20s that I sucked at communication. I realised that when I started to communicate better that others had less issues with me and I had less issues with them. But again, at her age I sucked at communication. The partner to me was the main issue because of the negativity (if they just said before the labour that it wasn't necessary for OP to be there then it would be a different story, but they didn't so they can't expect to hear nothing from OP after she was so thoroughly invested in being there - maybe it wasn't the best time for OP to bring it up but most people are highly emotional in the heat of the moment). The partner blew up and IMO probably didn't want the sister around. But they're so much younger than OP. So personally I'd let it slide. But I would have felt cut by the whole thing.

My husband was all prepared to be physically supportive, etc... when it came down to it, I wanted to be left alone.  I wanted him to just keep his hands to himself and sit quietly.  I thought I would be okay with having my mom around for labour... ultimately I found it really distracting to have anyone there.  I really just turned inwards and that's what worked for me.  Had my husband or my mom turned around and said, \"But you said you wanted me in the room!\" or \"But you said I would get to hold your hand or rub your back!\" I would have been really infuriated and upset, because the truth is until I was there I didn't KNOW what I wanted or needed, and if people were supporting me through a really intense physical process, they needed to do it in a way that actually helped me instead of in a way that was gratifying to them.
