If you didn't know, then the answer as far as they know is \"no one is home\" (even if you are).", "NTA but I'd tell your mother (and brother) that you will no longer be doing any form of babysitting of the boy if the friend continues to turn up unannounced. The boy will not be allowed in your room or near your stuff.

Unbelievable, I think honestly she's taking advantage of free childcare because your mom is not taking a stand. You can encourage mom to have better boundaries but essentially you can't control the friend or mom's actions, which will continue on so moving out is probably a good idea", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think the issue is that you seem to get a babysitting job without notice. I would lean towards that issue. You really have no right or place to tell your mom's friends when they can come over or what to do. That's her job and she needs to do it. If she won't then confront the friend about her kid. Let her know that if she continues to fail to call to see if it's ok for her kid to come play with you and your brothers stuff and for to see if you have time to hang out with him, then everything toy wise will be off limits including your company.  If she wants you to babysit, then she should schedule that in advance and pay you. Your time and availability should be respected by a simple phone call.  See that's where you can stand up to her and not be an ah.  Know your lane and you will also probably have a better outcome.", "NTA.\n\nAnd your mom actually can do something. She can put her foot down and make it known to this friend her home is not some hangout for her to show up at whenever she wants free babysitting. You could also just get up and leave, stop paying any attention to this kid. Send him to his mom and say you've got plans. Start charging her money if she and your mom insist on you watching him. Fake an illness and get them out of the house. Or something I often find myself suggesting on Reddit; get a good a sprinkler system and make it rain when they show up unannounced.", "NTA but what\u2019s up with your mom saying that \u201cthere is nothing she can do to stop this\u201d and \u201cshe will continue allowing this to happen\u201d. That\u2019s so strange because it sounds like she has zero control over what this person is doing and given your ages, she\u2019s already raised her kids and knows that what you are basically doing is baby sitting for someone who just shows up?\n\nYou\u2019ve made it obvious that it\u2019s an uncomfortable situation so why does it become your responsibility to establish boundaries? If your mother did speak with her, why does she continue to just show up? What dynamics are at play here?", "NTA \n\nget a keyed lock on your room door and either lock your self in and do your own thing go out every time they just arrive unanounced.\n\nBut ultimatly it is probably time to leave home, when you do make it clear to your mum this is the reason you are leaving.", "NTA. Get a lock, lock the door, and leave.  \nOr have some fun with it and become the sort of person who'd be a bad influence on him.  \nBuy some cigarettes and light one up every time she does it. Agree to stop doing it when asked, but do so again five minutes later. Claim you forgot.   \nPorn on all of the walls of your bedroom. Really filthy porn.   \nLoud music with no lyrics other than 'fuck'.   \nWalk around in nothing but a thong, covered in body butter. Say, sorry, you should have let me know you were coming or I wouldn't have put on a 2 hour skin treatment.\n\nPersonally I think leaving is better. If you can jump out of your bedroom window (and remember to take the key) then do that without their knowledge as soon as you notice they're there and you can. It's more fun and has a certain drama to it. Always come home drunk.", "get a lock on your door and go shopping everytime they come. if she tries to dump him on you tell her you will call the police that a child has been abandoned.", "NTA - But it is you mother's call as it is her house and not yours.  But if you get can mom's blessing, when this inconsiderate shows up next time tell her that sorry but you guys aren't accepting visits today and she should have called first to avoid confusion in the future.  That's it, set a boundary with this person and stick to it.", "that is reasonable. you are not a daycare. NTA", "NTA\nBut stop looking after the kid.  Go to your room and protect your own stuff.  When he starts breaking your mothers things she will find a way to tell her friend to stop calling by.", "NTA start charging for your time and she'll stop showing up unannounced", "I just wouldn\u2019t even answer the door anymore tbh.", "Next time she comes over, leave immediately. Make sure your door is locked when you leave. Or stay, but lick yourself in your room and say youre in the middle of helping a friend on your computer. Any excuse to avoid watching her son.", "YWNBTA - when this woman comes over with her child, leave the house, go for a walk, or whatever. You are not responsible for this. And get a lock for your bedroom door, so the the child can\u2019t get to your things.", "NTA but I'm a little confused why you can't just go to your room and not engage with the kid? Tell him you're studying, napping, cleaning...whatever and send him back to his mother.", "It's your mother's house, and she has said she is not going to tell her friend to stop. YTA if you don't respect that. You do get to be clear about your boundaries.  Make it clear that he is not allowed in your room,  and you are not supervising or entertaining him. Tell your mother that you are considering moving out because of this,  and ask for her help in maintaining your boundaries.  But if you can't find a way to live with your mother's boundaries about her house, your option is to move out.", "That's what my brother does. He's a year older than me, and he always just goes to the gym when the kid arrives. I'm usually the one looking after him.", " I would lean towards that issue. You really have no right or place to tell your mom's friends when they can come over or what to do.", "What I said about my mom was a bit paraphrased. She's basically just apathetic about this and doesn't really care if they show up unannounced. I don't know why she still does this after my mom spoke with her about it, but I hope she stops soon.", "Leave when the freeloader arrives  And get a keyed knob lock on your door.\n\nI can't believe your Mom is not supporting you.\n\nNTA", "Just in case it helps your understanding, esp with your mom, I wonder if there's a bit of a generational thing here. I'm 40 and when I was a teen/early 20s it was completely normal to just turn up to friends houses to hang out, whereas by the time I was in my late 20s, the social norms had changed and it was becoming much more expected that you called ahead. Now it is considered rude not to call or text first, especially by younger people, but there are still a lot of older people who go by what was the norm when they were younger. So your mom maybe doesn't see this as being as rude as you do. She also maybe enjoys her friend's company.\n\nThat said, the expectation that you babysit the kid is bs. I think it would be rude to tell her not to come round, especially as your mom doesn't mind, but it would be absolutely fine for you to stop babysitting and to lock your door so kiddo can't get in your room.", "If she\u2019s become apathetic towards the situation unfortunately you are being left with no choice than to confront them and make it known, that you are not appreciative of them just randomly appearing and you prefer they plan ahead and because you have no intentions of continuing to monitor their child. \u2014-Or, you can skip out like your brother does whenever they show up and lastly, you can just move out.", "I was actually thinking of getting a lock on my door.", "Stop thinking, start doing", "Teach the kid some swear words and get yourself labeled as a bad influence- theyll stop comin", "Get a lock on your door and tell the kid to play in your moms room. I bet she\u2019ll change her mind quick", "I'm sorry, but you have tried literally nothing and it looks like you're all out of ideas. No, you would not be the AH for not letting this woman take advantage of you."]}
