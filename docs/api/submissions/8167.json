The problem is that I can hear them clear as day screwing as they are loud. I\u2019ve mentioned a few times saying to Rosie I don\u2019t care what she does in her room but I need her and her girlfriend to keep the noise down as I need to sleep often going to bed early, when they are most active.\n\nThe noise has persisted and I finally snapped. When her girlfriend left, I said to Rosie \u2018keep the fucking noise down.\u2019 My tone was quite angry as I\u2019m pretty annoyed by this now and she started arguing with me. She said that I\u2019ve never asked Charlie to tone it down with a partner and she said I\u2019m being homophobic as I\u2019m targeting her and her girlfriend. I laughed at that and I told her I\u2019m not homophobic and she knows this and that I don\u2019t care if she has sex, but I don\u2019t need to hear it and it\u2019s affecting my sleep.

AITA?\n\nETA: I mentioned this in a comment but Rosie came out when she was 16. I cried tears of happiness as she was so damn miserable and I was so happy to see her finally be her true self. When she turned 18 (legal drinking age), she wanted to go to a gay bar so I went with her. I\u2019ve been to Pride with her before and I\u2019ve always supported her so it\u2019s deeply hurtful that she accuses me of being against her sexuality.\n\nETA 2; Charlie is at her boyfriends place a lot so doesn\u2019t hear the noise as often as me. If she is home, she often wears ear plugs or headphones. It doesn\u2019t bother her as much as she doesn\u2019t need to go to bed early like I do. I think she just doesn\u2019t want to get dragged into it which I don\u2019t blame her for.\n\nETA 3: whilst I absolutely love the people telling me to beat Rosie at her own game by blasting porn, having loud sex and stuff, it won\u2019t happen.

Accusing you of homophobia for refusing to put up with hearing her having loud sex with her girlfriend in her bedroom when you're trying to rest after working a backbreaking 12 hour shift is beyond ludicrous.
