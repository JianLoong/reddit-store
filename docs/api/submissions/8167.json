Both girls still live at home whilst working and attend uni. I\u2019m absolutely delighted that both girls are still here and I don\u2019t think I ask for much in return. All I ask is that they tidy up after themselves, do some chores such as washing up, washing dishes etc. and just chip in for food which I buy. In return, they don\u2019t pay rent, they have free reign of the house, they can have guests over and their partners over as much as they want and can do what they want. I just want my house to be clean as they live in it too. There is only one rule that is non negotiable for me. I don\u2019t mind if the girls make noise, but I do emphasise that I need the noise to be at a reasonable level. I work as a nurse at a hospital snd very frequently do 12 hour shifts starting anywhere from 4-6am so I need my sleep.\n\nI\u2019m having trouble with Rosie lately making an insane amount of noise with her girlfriend. It\u2019s clear to me they are in the honeymoon phase of their relationship. That doesn\u2019t bother me and I\u2019m glad Rosie has met a nice young woman. The problem is that I can hear them clear as day screwing as they are loud. I\u2019ve mentioned a few times saying to Rosie I don\u2019t care what she does in her room but I need her and her girlfriend to keep the noise down as I need to sleep often going to bed early, when they are most active.\n\nThe noise has persisted and I finally snapped. When her girlfriend left, I said to Rosie \u2018keep the fucking noise down.\u2019 My tone was quite angry as I\u2019m pretty annoyed by this now and she started arguing with me. She said that I\u2019ve never asked Charlie to tone it down with a partner and she said I\u2019m being homophobic as I\u2019m targeting her and her girlfriend. I laughed at that and I told her I\u2019m not homophobic and she knows this and that I don\u2019t care if she has sex, but I don\u2019t need to hear it and it\u2019s affecting my sleep. I also said that I\u2019ve never had to listen to her sister being intimate with her boyfriend so the two can\u2019t be measured.\n\nShe said that I don\u2019t understand her, that she\u2019s young and just wanting to have fun, she called me an AH, stormed off in a huff and has taken to avoiding me. AITA?\n\nETA: I mentioned this in a comment but Rosie came out when she was 16. I cried tears of happiness as she was so damn miserable and I was so happy to see her finally be her true self. When she turned 18 (legal drinking age), she wanted to go to a gay bar so I went with her. I\u2019ve been to Pride with her before and I\u2019ve always supported her so it\u2019s deeply hurtful that she accuses me of being against her sexuality.\n\nETA 2; Charlie is at her boyfriends place a lot so doesn\u2019t hear the noise as often as me. If she is home, she often wears ear plugs or headphones. It doesn\u2019t bother her as much as she doesn\u2019t need to go to bed early like I do. I think she just doesn\u2019t want to get dragged into it which I don\u2019t blame her for.\n\nETA 3: whilst I absolutely love the people telling me to beat Rosie at her own game by blasting porn, having loud sex and stuff, it won\u2019t happen. I am single right now and am happy with that.\n\nETA 4: idk if people are reading what I said at the start but I\u2019m the DAD, not mum, DAD.", "created_utc": 1674577976, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10k9i8r/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_keep_the_fucking/", "score": 1088, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Accusing you of homophobia for refusing to put up with hearing her having loud sex with her girlfriend in her bedroom when you're trying to rest after working a backbreaking 12 hour shift is beyond ludicrous.

It's your house and you're already being accommodating enough by allowing her to bring her SO into your home. Many parents would not allow anything close to that. I will say It probably didn't help that you yelled at her though. Maybe reproach the topic when you've cooled down and tell her that it's just the noise not her partner or sexuality that's bothering you. If she still keeps up her BS, be prepared to ban partners from the house and that includes for your other daughter too while while not fair to her will show that you're being equal with rules.", "NTA\n\nFrankly I'm mortified Rosie seems not to care if her *FATHER* can hear her fucking.\n\nUsually kids don't want their parents to have an intimate knowledge of their activities.\n\nWeird - and frankly disgusting - she's trying to use the homophobic claim on you when you're not. It's your house. She's your daughter. It's very reasonable to not want to hear her and her gf's sex noises while you try to sleep.\n\nIdk if talking to her gf is something you're comfortable with, but it might work better to appeal to her than Rosie. And if it does, Rosie will be more apt to listen to her girlfriend than her dad, lol.\n\nGood luck, and I hope Rosie can calm down with the noise.", "NTA\n\n\nShe's being rude and deflecting and it's not cute.", "NTA.\n\nCall a family meeting with both girls and their significant others present.\n\nSay the following: \"As you all know, I need a quiet house to sleep as I have a very demanding job. There has been a lot of noise during my sleep time. I tried addressing it with the individual privately, however it was intoned that I was being unfair for targeting this individual and not everyone. I am rectifying this now. I am asking all of you that if you are having loud sex, please do not do so in the house during the hours of ___ as I will be sleeping and cannot have my sleep disturbed. If you must have sex during these times, please do so at your significant other's house, in a hotel, in your car, or wherever the mood strikes you. Just not in the house. Meeting adjourned.\"", "NTA. I second the advice to interrupt them. Rosie might not care that you can hear them, but her girlfriend might.

Please stop being so loud, or do this elsewhere.\u201d", "NTA and this is just my own petty ramblings here, not exactly suggesting you do this, but does the girlfriend know you can hear her and Rosie? If Rosie hasn't told her, you could talk to the girlfriend about it and if she has any shame she'll get Rosie to quiet down. Or record what you can hear and play it for the both of them later on.

I\u2019m bisexual and this is NOT homophobic. She\u2019s being disrespectful. This would be disrespectful if it were a heterosexual couple as well.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to respond to accusations of homophobia if you are straight, so I think that that\u2019s why she\u2019s saying this. I promise you, as long as this is the whole story, you are not being homophobic.", "NTA\n\nThe audacity of getting a free place to live as an adult in \u201cextra education\u201d with very little rules, and to have loud sex where your dad can hear\u2026.

As a homosexual womn I find it extremely odd that you would accuse a supportive parent of being homophobic for making reasonable demands. She's 21, she shouldn't even be having sex at her childhoodhome at that age. I still live with my parents due to uni and I've never brought another woman home and slept with her. I would feel so ashamed if my parents heard me and my partner in bed and asked me to tone it down even once. The fact that you have asked her to tone it down multiple times is odd as fuck. She's an adult, you shouldn't have to hear your grown ass child have sex when you're trying to sleep. NTA.", "NTA - it\u2019s reasonable to ask them to keep it down.

So, from someone who was also an insufferable gay 20-year-old at one point, here is how you handle this: you tell Rosie (calmly and matter of factly) that you did not consent to being a participant in her exhibitionist scene.  That she is welcome to explore and enjoy her sexuality, but that by forcing you to listen to her and her girlfriend she is making you part of her sex life in a way you are not comfortable with.  Start leaving information about BDSM and kink etiquette outside her bedroom.  Ideally in a place her girlfriend will notice because there's always the possibility that she's unaware that they're being overheard.\n\nIf that doesn't work, it's time to bring in the girlfriend.  Tell *her* that you keep overhearing them.  That should be enough to embarrass her even if it doesn't embarrass Rosie (honestly who wants to be overheard by their partner's dad?), but if not you pull back out the consent line.  That's got like a 98% chance of success due to awkwardness factor alone.  In the meantime, get some good earplugs.", "NTA. Seems like you're a pretty Rad Dad! and all your asking your daughter to do is to be respectful to literally the one rule you stand by. She knew she is in the wrong which is why she lashed out and called you homophobic. Which is 100000% not fair, since you seem so supportive of that. Seems like she might need a dose of reality and have her get her own place..", "NTA. It\u2019s not too much to ask for her to be quite. She is being very rude to you and doesn\u2019t appear to respect you at all. Maybe she should move in with her girlfriend and pay some bills.", "Holy cow, you are NTA. If my husband heard our daughter and her boyfriend going at it, he definitely wouldn't be as nice as you. It's called respect, and clearly your daughter has none of it.", "NTA next time the girlfriend is over just mention that you are glad they are having a good time, but please keep the volume down during private time as you are trying to sleep, and unfortunately at the volume they are enjoying themselves it\u2019s no longer private.

If you don\u2019t want to do this then tell your daughter either she keeps it own or you will have this conversation with her girlfriend.", "NTA it\u2019s a reasonable request", "Thats what happens when you try to be friends with your kids, good luck because you are going to need it", "NTA. Seriously, it's time for her to move out. Apparently growing up is not going to happen until she does.", "NTA. It\u2019s completely reasonable to not want to constantly hear your child having sex lol, especially late at night. It\u2019s obviously not homophobic and that\u2019s mean of her to try to use that word to hurt you tbh", "NTA. I think you should have the same conversation with her partner next time you see her (without the anger).  Let her know that you hear everything they are doing and that 1- you don't want to hear that and  2- it's preventing you from getting much needed sleep.  \nIt sounds pretty clear that her sexuality isn't any part of your complaint.  \nI'd be horrified and mortified if my parents heard me having sex!!!", "NTA. What you are asking is just normal behavior. She is being very immature. And being gay doesn\u2019t mean that she doesn\u2019t have to obey the rules.", "NTA\n\nGoddamn, I could not imagine not immediately dying of embarrassment from my parent telling me to be quieter during sex.", "NTA. You\u2019re asking for some basic respect from her. I can\u2019t imagine doing 12 hour shifts, mostly standing, with little or disturbed sleep. It would be so incredibly exhausting. Boundaries need to be set, as no parent wants to hear their child\u2019s loud sex keeping them up at night!", "NTA and I recommend using an audio recorder app on your phone (there's probably one included by default) next time htey are loudly having sex, then send her the audio recording. She'll probably be mortified and realize how loud she really is.", "ESH. She's being disrespectful, you shouldn't speak to your daughter that way.", "NTA in the big picture, but YTA for not using appropriate tone in that moment.

You need to leave, and you two need to adjust your volume next time.\"\n\nIf it keeps up, I would honestly tell your daughter she can no longer have her partner over after X time of night, since she can't seem to respect the house rules.\n\nIf she has an issue with that, she can move out and have her neighbors filling noise complaints instead.

Maybe the embarrassment of sitting her and the girlfriend down together for a chat would have better results!", "I wonder if it's time to sit them both down at the same time, unsure if that would work. But sometimes the partner will have more respect for the other parent than the actual child does (read: child as in offspring, not age). I know this is a slippery slope and a dangerous game, but it could be a step needed at some point.", "Yea exactly. Maybe start questioning why she wants her dad to hear her having sex.", "If you want a real mood-killer, try \"Weird Al\"", "NTA - if she\u2019s pulling the homophobic card, time to pull the heterosexual homeowner card and blast porn in the living room at 6 AM to wake her up until she gets the message.", "I can't even have sex when my mom is in another room, no matter how quiet we are and if she's for sure sleeping, it's just one of the worst turn-offs for me.
