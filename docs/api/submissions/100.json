It is not \"Halloween Costume Day\", just \"Costume Day\". They sent out an e-mail specifically specifying that they are not using the word \"Halloween\" in order to be inclusive of all that want to dress up in a costume, whether they celebrate/acknowledge Halloween or not. At the preschool they don't acknowledge any holidays of any kind (no Christmas time activities, no Easter stuff, no Passover, etc), so it's not super surprising to me that they chose this language. \n\nTo say this set my husband off is an understatement. He feels that this has gone one step too far in being PC, because this isn't a religious holiday (in his mind) and kids are going to run into Halloween in the real world. Halloween is just a fun time to dress up and get candy. I agree with all of this. We believe in educating our child on different cultures, practices, and holidays so that our child can be a well rounded kid with an understanding that people have different beliefs/do things different ways. He feels that if we are to be accommodating of others and their beliefs, it should go the other way too and the non-Halloween people should respect our choices of celebrating \"Halloween\".\n\nThe issue at hand is now he is having a meeting with the director of the preschool this afternoon and he wants me there to voice my concerns as well. While I do agree with him, our child is only in this preschool for another a year and then moving onto kindergarten elsewhere. I understand his frustration with the language of it, but Halloween/Costume Day is basically over and it just seems like a weird hill to die on. I have a lot of other things to spend my energy on and it's fine with me if he wants to go discuss it but since I don't feel as passionate as him I don't want to be involved.

You can tell him you will go, but only if you are free to express YOUR opinion rather than just mimic his.\n\nPS your husband is wrong.  Tomorrow is All Saint's Day aka All Hallow's Day.  Which makes today All Hallow's Eve aka Hallow E'en.  Saying Halloween is a non-religious holiday is the same as saying Christmas Eve is not religious.  For most people that's true because most people are not religious, but it has a religious background.", "NTA.  Your husband is a complete hypocrite.  He's railing against the school for having a generic \"Costume Day\" on the grounds that it's not a religious day while ignoring the fact that the very name of the holiday, \"Halloween\" has religious connotations.

I had a good friend growing up when I was in elementary school whose parents were Muslim from Africa, and they did not let her celebrate Halloween. It was hard for her. I remember as a kid, I didn't understand. They used the word Halloween in school and I remember judging her family. I was like 10. But I think that if the school had made it more clearer that it's costume day and not Halloween, she would have had a much easier time. She got bullied because she wasn't allowed to participate, even though she wanted to. I didn't bully her but I do remember thinking it was stupid, and part of that was because the school supported the use of the word Halloween. And I thought that if the school supported it, it couldn't be wrong and therefore her family must be wrong. I wish the school had done what your school is doing. I think it would have made her life easier, and she was a good kid and deserved it. And that's just one example, but there are other religions that explicitly ban Halloween participation. Calling it costume day will allow those kids to participate. That's a big deal! Why can't he understand that?\n\nYour husband is explicitly incorrect. They don't do any other holidays, it sounds like they are all about letting the kids celebrate and dress up. There are actual religious and specific cultural backgrounds to Halloween, and that does not include everybody. It's possible that your husband isn't very smart.  Your husband is just wrong. And you need to stand up for what's right.", "NTA:  kindly remind your husband that \"PC\" really just means \"respecting other people\".  there are plenty of people who specifically think halloween is bad.  this lets kids dress up without conflicting with anyone's beliefs.  and causes no harm, whatsoever.", "NTA  \nIt hurts no one if it is called Costume day. Your husband sounds like one of those people who will be horrible if their older.

Decline to go and tell him you have other things to do with his time. Ironically, he is just adding to the odds something like this is fully canceled by creating his own culture war: The Right To Halloween, SPECIFICALLY.\n\nCostume Day isn't \"PC\", it is inclusive. Just as \"Happy Holidays\" is inclusive. Your family can call it Halloween, just as your family can say \"Merry Christmas\", and it isn't an affront to your husband for people to not use the same language as him. I say Happy Holidays because I live in a diverse area and it's easier than saying Merry Christmas to a Jewish person (who happily says thank you, by the way) and then spending the subway ride cringing at myself (self inflicted, totally). Schools use language similarly - to make everyone happy and not deal with bitching like your husband. \n\nThe irony of people saying that they are tired of their language/ideals being policed and so are going to ensure their exact language is used, is not lost on me.", "NTA.\n\n> this isn't a religious holiday (in his mind)\n\nTell him to take it up with the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.

But in 24 hours it\u2019s a moot point for you, and the school won\u2019t likely change.", "NTA\n\nI might roll my eyes at \"costume day,\" but having a meeting with the preschool director about this is embarrassing. I wouldn't want to go if I were you, either.", "NTA \n\nThis is so clearly a case of \u201cpick your battles.\u201d Energy is finite, and I too would resist spending mine on something trivial that, at the end of the day, hurts no one.", "NTA, your husband is so busy feeling self-righteous about this \"on principle\" that he doesn't actually seem to be thinking about the material effects this \"Halloween\" thing will have and if it's worth it. Does he choose other weird hills to die on? It sounds like he cares more about being right than for the actual outcomes of what he advocates for.\n\n>kids are going to run into Halloween in the real world\n\nThis tells me that he fundamentally misunderstands the purpose of \"Costume Day\". It's obviously not to \"keep kids away from Halloween\" - it's to prevent *parents* from making a fuss about Halloween and potentially trying to stop the event, and the event is for the kids to have fun and wear costumes. It's to prevent the teachers from having to deal with that headache. And it's allowing kids who don't celebrate Halloween to not feel left out, and to also enjoy a nice costume day.\n\nIf your husband succeeds in convincing the director that \"Costume Day\" is a bad idea and should be \"Halloween\" explicitly, one of two things will happen:\n\n1. Costume day will be cancelled entirely and a bunch of excited kids will be devastated and disappointed\n2. They'll change it to \"Halloween day\" and then some other set of parents will complain and *then* the day will be cancelled entirely\n\nDoes he want that? Or does he not cares what happens other than winning an argument?\n\n>one step too far in being PC\n\nHm, interesting wording here.

It's a ridiculous hill to die on.\n\nYou and your husband presumably knew the preschool's philosophy upon enrollment. They are not excluding your child from anything.

You can simply do it in your own time.", "If the school doesn't want to celebrate holidays and be inclusive, they shouldn't have \"costume day\" on Halloween.

Your husband is an adult and should be able to handle the meeting on his own. With that being said, if he never asks you for support and is asking you this time, you just have to decide whether it's more important for you to support your husband or avoid an uncomfortable situation. Only you can answer that. It's important for spouses to support each other, even if it's just being there. Maybe you guys can compromise and you can be there at the meeting but he do all the talking.

That does seem just stupid and overly PC. Genuinely curious who would take offense to use of the word Halloween. However, it's really not worth an argument over, in the same way I can't see who would be offended by using it, I really can't see why someone would be offended by not using it. I don't see what the gain is by having this argument.", "NTA\n\nHalloween has its origins in paganism and/or Catholicism, so it would fall under a religious-holiday ban.

That said, if your husband isn\u2019t often impassioned about things like this, then maybe it\u2019s important to support him when he is, even if you find it silly?", "NTA. Your husband is completely right. Halloween has been 100% secularized in this country for more than a century and is not currently a religious holiday in any sense of the word. It is as much a religious holiday as Christmas is a pagan holiday. Many holidays, including Easter and Christmas also have pagan roots. The pagan root of Halloween is Samhain. https://www.history.com/topics/halloween/history-of-halloween#:\\~:text=The%20All%20Saints%27%20Day%20celebration,Eve%20and%2C%20eventually%2C%20Halloween. \n\nI too am offended by ignorance pretending to be \"diversity\" or \"tolerance\". People who run daycares are not known for depth of cultural education and this is one more clear example. However we do not choose our daycare providers for their education, which is part of the reason it is considered an unskilled underpaid job. \n\nThe problem is that we need to pick our battles and calculate cost and benefit. What does your husband want from his \"crusade\"? A re-introduction of the word Halloween? An acknowledgement of ignorance? What might be the cost apart from some wasted time? Will it affect the care of your child or how welcome they are? Will it get him a reputation for being obnoxious or difficult to deal with (not always bad, but still...)? Will it affect relations with other parents? I might go forward with this, but only after thinking through benefits and costs.", "YTA for even agreeing with your husband at all. You guys are completely within your rights to celebrate any holiday you want, any way you want however you are not entitled to tell other people how to or whether to celebrate. If you don't like what the school teaches remove your child from the school. You can teach your child anything you want at home so do that.

And there's multiple religions that applies to. It's not just one tiny group, it's multiple tiny groups. And it's possible that there are kids from those groups in these classes. Calling it costume day means that those kids get to participate with their friends and have a fun day. And none of the philosophy behind it matters. As much as the kids getting to have a fun day.

A pagan down the road can light a bonfire and dance around it to celebrate Samhain, and we\u2019re celebrating different things. Diwali was just last week - Diwali and Samhain aren\u2019t the same festival, just as Diwali and Halloween aren\u2019t the same thing. \n\nIf other religions are celebrating something else at the same time, it doesn\u2019t mean one is derivative of the other.\n\nAnd I think it\u2019s a pretty human psychological need to have religious festivals at certain points of the solar year, to mark the passage of time and accept the way it makes us feel. Plus religious festivals tend to have pretty generic themes, so it\u2019s not surprising there\u2019s overlap", "I moved down to Texas from Philly and joked to my students not to get arrested on mischief night. They had no clue what I was talking about.", "It's more that we have very few pre-Christian records of northwestern Europe at all, and those that we do have were written by Roman generals (who were \\*infamous\\* for making things up to make themselves look good--want more acclaim at home? invent more crazy things to say about the druids!). Everything else was written hundreds of years later, and by Christians, because neither the ancient Celts nor the ancient Norse nor the pre-Christian Saxons had a written literature. So we don't know if the ancient Norse used holly for yule, because we don't know what the ancient Norse did in wintertime pretty much at all. Almost everything we know about the Norse is from the sagas and eddas written in the 1200s by Christians.\n\nSimilarly, Christmas trees. Might ancient non-Christian people have brought trees inside and decorated them? Sure they could have, we can't prove they didn't. But our first documented thing that a modern person would look at and say \"Yep, that's a Christmas tree\" was in the 1600s, by Protestant Christians in Germany. There's nothing tracing it before that besides \"it would sort of make sense that people in the past might have done this.\"\n\nSame thing is true of Samhain. We know what Christian writers, hundreds of years after Christianity became the popular religion of the area, wrote about it. But we have very little idea what it actually was before Christianity, and obviously, a lot changes in more than a hundred years of conquest and Christianization. And a lot of the ideas of \"this was obviously an ancient Celtic/Germanic tradition\" was made up by the Victorians, as part of British nationalism.\n\ntl;dr: the first northwestern European peoples who we know anything significant about regarding specific beliefs were Christians, because their predecessors didn't have a written literary tradition. Everyone before that, all we have is material culture and records by Romans.", "Forbidding Christmas itself is extraordinarily rare outside of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, but it\u2019s actually not that uncommon in some places to forbid certain parts of it (Santa Claus, Christmas trees, Yule logs). And that\u2019s precisely because they\u2019re pagan (or perceived to be pagan\u2014historians largely question the direct lineage from prechristian rites to modern practices of Christmas or for that matter Halloween, but both these types of Christians and most modern pagans believe in that lineage, which is what matters if you\u2019re trying not to offend people), so they keep just the specifically Christian elements. Same for Easter. \n\nI don\u2019t disagree with your larger point, though. Most people aren\u2019t going to assume that you\u2019re taking a religious stance either way with a Halloween party. Heck, most people don\u2019t blink at Christmas parties either.", ">  I can\u2019t imagine most rational people would assume the daycare was taking a religious stance if any kind instead of just doing something fun for the kids.\n\nThe daycare is taking a secular stance, so that religious kids will get to dress up, too."]}
