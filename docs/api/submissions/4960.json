When I got the text I realized that I had not yet ordered their gift. We had been thinking about what to get them for a while (they are quite wealthy and have everything so it\u2019s hard to pick out a gift for them) and landed on a really nice (multi hundred dollar) cast iron pan. They love to cook and eat and don\u2019t have one so we thought it was the perfect gift. We placed the order and the website didn\u2019t give the option to ship it is a gift so I just put my FIL\u2019s name on the shipping info and thought nothing of it. I sent them both a text letting them know to expect the package in the mail. \n\nJump forward to yesterday, we get the text asking about the package they received, I tell them oh that was your Christmas gift- hope you like it. Sorry the surprised got ruined and of course it\u2019s for both of you.  And about an hour later my husband asks me to come into his office and says he just got off the phone with this dad.  His dad told him that his SO (let\u2019s call him Tom) was very upset because his name was not on the gift, and that Tom felt that we sent them the gift as an afterthought when they told us to expect their gift to us in the mail. My SO tried to explain the reasoning behind only one name being on the package and that their text had just been the trigger for us to choose which pan we would get them and get the order in, but that we had put significant thought into the gift.  His dad was adamant that Toms feelings were very hurt and that we needed to call him to smooth things over.  \n\nAs a side note, situations like this have happened in the past, where Toms feelings are hurt and we are asked to apologize.  I\u2019ve never quite felt that sense of \u201coh I\u2019ve really messed up here\u201d when this happened in the past. And I don\u2019t totally think we\u2019ve done something wrong this time around either. But there\u2019s a big part of me that is wondering, AITA?", "created_utc": 1671278834, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zo4yut/aita_for_sending_my_father_in_law_and_his_spouse/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have to ask what were his grievances the prior times that he believes you directed towards him? The way I read this is that FIL and Tom are both males and Tom feels that you do not respect him in the relationship with FIL because of homosexuality, ask yourself if you may have subconsciously been throwing shade his way. Also need more back story, what happened to your husbands mother, how long has FIL and Tom been in a relationship, is the relationship solid or do you feel it is lopsided and that Tom is using FIL?", "NTA I don't think both names should be on the shipping label.

Dad had children possibly from a previous relationship where he was closeted - likely from a generation where being gay was not okay.\n\nTom might be in the same boat. Or, Tom may feel like a bit of an outsider now that he\u2019s the SO in a blended family. Tom just wants to feel included. He is your FIL\u2019s significant other. They live together. The polite thing to do is address things to both of them - for no other reason than to acknowledge they are a couple and both part of the family. \n\nIt\u2019s symbolic, OP. I know it seems silly, but try to remember that there are lots of folks out there who spent most of their lives acting the part of someone they weren\u2019t meant to be. That\u2019s gotta be really really hard. \n\nSend Tom a sincere apology note, say something nice, and try to move forward.

If you can\u2019t do gift wrap, the only decent thing to do is put both names on. I can see why Tom is hurt. You may not have intentionally excluded him, but it was thoughtless.", "If the box it was shipped in was it's \"gift wrapping\", then YTA.  The gift was literally only tagged for your FIL.

If it's not internally gift-wrapped or with a card as enclosure, then the outer shipping label is the only clue people have.  \n\nIdeally you should have put \"FIL & Tom (Xmas gift)\" in the address field so that it was clear, especially if you know that it's a sensitive subject.  \n\nBite the bullet one more time, call Tom and apologise.
