She has such a restricted diet already it probably is extremely unhealthy to be restricting that even further. If she going to do that though she is going to need to figure out how to do that in a healthy manner herself shouldn't be left up to you.", "NTA. So she took a complicated diet and made it even more complicated. Yikes. Is she vegan for ethical reasons or thinking it would help her medical issues? Does she cook for herself then or what does she do? Is she doing anything to figure out how to do combo meals that would work for her then you could add other ingredients to? (that's what my boyfriend and I do)", "Is she on a low fodmop diet? That's a tough diet to follow while vegan. She should consult with a dietician or nutritionist to make sure her diet is balanced.

I also can't have leftover food because it starts to develop the same chemical that's present in alcohol & other aged foods. It's pretty restrictive. I would not expect anyone else to cook or prepare my food for me, TBH it's a massive PITA doing it myself. I prefer a diet high in fresh vegetables (I used to be vegetarian, vegan for a while but that's obviously not viable!). There is one brand of tinned soup that I can have, they do one flavour that doesn't set off my symptoms. I don't generally eat processed food. So I have some insight here.\n\nTBH I that if your wife has such wide ranging food intolerances, she needs to be more realistic, and accept that she needs to spend at least part of her free time preparing & organising food for the week ahead, & probably not add voluntary restrictions to her diet. If she is going to expect/ask you to do some of the food prep, she needs to do the planning of her meals, or accept whatever you give her, & not complain that she doesn't like it, or that it's repetitive. It's not acceptable to dictate to you in this way & then complain it's not enough. And, while you could perhaps eat the same meals together a few times a week - maybe pick a couple that you like - it's not on for her to request that you also live on such a restricted diet. And she needs to come up with a suitable, healthy, affordable protein source.

I would suggest that your wife also CAN NOT eat healthily on a vegan diet. She may need medical assistance - it is possible she has anorexia disguised by orthorexia. That could require therapy. At the very least she needs to consult with an actual nutritionist because potatoes and oats are not enough to live on in the long run.", "NTA.

I earned the most toe curling kiss when I found Pringle kiddie snack packs of BBQ chips; 90mgs of potassium per little cup and my wife's favorite flavor. When her numbers are down around mid range for normal, she gets to have a treat of one of those cups. And it's sexy as heck to see her enjoy it.\nShe'd tell your gal to go see a licensed nutritional specialist,  because fact that she's deliberately vegan and has such restrictions means she's not maintaining a healthy electrolyte balance.

You put in good effort to participate directly and supply her meals. In the end you couldn't keep it up. That is fair. Cooking tasty and filling vegan meals, in addition to your own preferred food, is a lot of work. You should not have to bend over backwards to do this routinely.\n* Presumably you are still supporting her veganism by allowing her to source her own meals, not demanding she eat your food, not shaming her about her choices, etc.  \n\nHere's where you *are* the asshole. \n\n* Refusing to cook for her AT ALL is a passive aggressive attempt to get her to abandon her veganism. If you think it is harming her, address it more appropriately. Have her see a nutritionist. \n* You could easily scale the effort way back, stop making her meals regularly, but still make her something nice once in a while. That much wouldn't kill you.\n* Food sharing with one's partner is an important bonding ritual.

So you eat carbs and we all need them but we also need other nutrients.

A lot of people for low fodmap (for good reason) and forget that they should be checking what they can tolerate every so often.
