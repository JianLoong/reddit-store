She left me as the sole caregiver to 3 of her children while she struggled with alcoholism and drug use due to her depression and PTSD. She illegally took me out of school at 10 yrs old, and for 7 more years, I would not have any education, medical attention, or contact with anyone my mother didn\u2019t approve of. Any contact I had with family was monitored by her. I raised 3 of her children, 2 for virtually their whole life (6/4-year-old). But as of last year, a month before my 17th birthday) my siblings and I were removed from her care and her much more stable and put-together sister has been our guardian since. I cut ties with my mother for about 6 months, and only regained contact with her because she had a baby, and if I want to see the children I raised I have to be civil with her. But I\u2019ve made it very clear my siblings are the only reason she\u2019s tolerated. But as of a few days ago my grandmother was hospitalized and went in for surgery. My mother messaged me seeking comfort because she was worried about her mom but I ignored her. But other people have pointed out that I\u2019m the only person she can spend on emotionally like that. And they expressed how heartless I was for being unwilling to console her. They believe I\u2019m being childish and should move on and forgive her.

NTA of course - but let\u2019s have a chat. \n\nYour mother was horribly abusive, and the fact that you\u2019ve turned okay is a credit to you. It\u2019s hard to shut down that part of our brains that\u2019s conditioned to respond to abuse, so please remember this:\n\n\ud83d\udc9bNo is a complete sentence\n\n\ud83d\udc9cYou don\u2019t owe your mother a single thing, including comfort\n\n\ud83d\udc99Anyone calling you heartless probably has their own motives. \n\nHugs from this random Internet mum!", "NTA. There's a lot of damage done here and people can't just tell you to move on and embrace/console your abuser, particularlyafter such a short time. That's ridiculous. NTA.", "NTA. You are your mother's child. You are not her psychotherapist, co-parent, or shoulder to cry on. You are a child, at least in the eyes of literally everyone else. You had to do a lot of growing up in a very short amount of time, so your mother and others may be under the delusion that you are an adult \n\nYou deserve therapy, education, and a childhood. I suggest you cut your mother off until you can get at least one or two of those things.", "NTA. She was a shitty parent and you don\u2019t owe her anything.", "Oh hell no.\n\nOther people are too quick to pass their judgement, you've been parentified, and neglected your whole life yet you're the one out of line? No.\n\nYou look after yourself, if you don't have the bandwidth or want to be there for your mother then that's 100% valid.\n\nYou can be as selfish as you need to be with your time and headspace.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Forgiveness is touted to be cathartic to the forgiver.   If in the same situation, I find it difficult to think that I would be in any mood to forgive.    The abuse you received for all of those years seem unimaginable to me in today's world.   Where was child services?  May the future hold the peace and success that you deserve.", "NTA. You just take care of yourself, you don\u2019t need to take care of her. Do not let anyone give you any guilt because you shouldn\u2019t have one ounce of guilt for taking care of yourself. It\u2019s a very healthy choice to just leave her alone.", "NTA \n\nRead this as me singing:\n\n\ud83c\udfbc Don't call someone childish - when they're a child!\n\nIf anyone comes at you \"I'm not going to waste time on an adult when the kids need me.\"", "Hell no.

She was grossly negligent in the performance of her parenting duties and parentified you. I see those circumstances as perfect justification for not reaching out to her for several months. I don't think you were heartless at all. In my opinion, the only heartless people are your mother for what she did to her children and the people insisting that you instantly forgive her and be her comfort/therapist.", "NTA", "This ^^^\n\nYou are NTA. You would never be the asshole if you chose not to speak or contact her again for the rest of your life.
