I said it was something my husband and I could talk about.\n\nSecond time we talked baby names and she was more annoyed because she said her husband liked hideous names and didn't appreciate any of the gorgeous choices she liked.

(Biggest joke I got was \"will you name your kids \"China\", \"India\", \"Korea\", etc, because \"they came from you\"... Bet you can guess my name now, but the spelling is a doozy lol)\n\nI purposefully named my son something that wasn't on the \"top 1000 names\" of 2022 when he was born in late February & people either love the name or hate it, there is no in-between. As a clue, my son's name means \"Sea Fortress\" in Welsh & his name is pretty famous. I love the name, my partner loves the name (he wanted our son's name to be Charles after his dad, but that's his middle name now lol) & he couldn't believe I was nerdy enough to give our son his name. \n\nNo one should dictate what you want to name your kid, but people are allowed to disagree with it. Personally, I didn't want a \"John\", \"Robert\", \"Sam\", or any \"normal name\", but I also didn't want a trending \"unconventional\" name like \"River\". \n\nIt's not my kid, I don't get to dictate other parents choices, but if they're naming their kid something super dumb (read a post recently about someone naming their kid \"Cowboy\") or the spelling REALLY doesn't make sense (Cxssxdy - Cassidy), I will step in & say something regarding it, otherwise not my monkey not my circus.\n\nName your kid whatever you are happiest with & don't let anyone tell you to change it without good reason (ie. It's the most popular name & you will have your child being \"Henry K\" with five other Henry's in his class.

Your sister sounds mentally unstable.  I feel bad for her husband, who made the questionable choice of having a child with this woman.  She sounds like a true narcissist.", "NTA. Your sister is projecting and crossing boundaries. The fact that she snooped on your husband\u2019s laptop is incredibly disturbing. I cannot even fathom one of my siblings doing that.", "NTA You tried to as sisters. She and her husband rejected everything you came up with. Lastly she snooped when she shouldn't have and had the nerve to tell you she hated those names. And now she shocked that you don't want to continue this anymore? She needs to find names she and her husband like for their baby and leave you alone when it comes to naming yours.", "NTA.  How entitled do you have to be to think you can name someone else's child? And to violate your privacy by snooping?\n\n And frankly, though I like both yours and your sister's names, I do like yours better.", "NTA. Just because you\u2019re twins doesn\u2019t mean she gets to control what you do. That\u2019s crazy, and refraining from even talking about names seems like the way to go. Is she going to be this controlling and entitled with your child?\n\nUm, I feel like you\u2019re just breezing over the fact that she snooped on your husband\u2019s computer! If you\u2019re not being very direct with her and telling her that is completely unacceptable, then you\u2019re not doing yourself or your family any favors.", "NTA. She snooped through your husbands laptop and thinks she can name your child? Yeah she has some serious boundary issues.", "NTA. Being twins doesn't give her naming rights for your child.\n\nShe has atrocious boundaries and you need to keep your electronics password protected unless you posted the baby names online.\n\nI'd be wary of her, next she'll want identical nurseries or something", "NTA and also wtf. this is so beyond obsessive and strange ...", "NTA.  First, it's not any of her business. \n\n Second I think as a twin your sister has attachment and control issues regarding her relationship with you. She wants you and her to prioritize your sibling relationship over your relationships with your spouses.", "NTA. Has the pregnancy hormones made your sister a little crazy? She gets NO opinion on what you & your hubby decided to name your child. And to snooped on your husband's laptop! Yea, no more baby name talk with the sister.", "NTA. I'm afraid you're sister may have some kind of insecurity about her name and is projecting that onto both your babies. Or alternatively she may want to take some kind of control over something and this is the thing she's decided to try and control. Not really sure.\n\nIt could also be simply shes have a bit of a new mom panic. Some new mothers I've met get into a 'mode' where they feel every decision for their future baby needs to be 'perfect' right down to the name. This has even led some to do things like what you're sister did with the snooping. \n\nPoint being, enforce the no baby name discussion rule, but don't stop discussing other things with your sister. It's possible this whole name thing is just the symptom of other insecurities you're sister might have as a new mother.", "NTA I see you sister trying to persuade you to dress your children in cutesy matchty-matchy outfits in the future. Somethings you need to nip in the bud and trying to control the name of your baby is a good place to start.", "NTA. Your sister has no right to name your baby. Seems like she's scrambling since she can't have any of her \"dream names\" due to her husband vetoing them and is trying to control you instead. It's a HUGE violation of privacy that she looked through your husband's laptop to find your name last, instead of respecting your wishes to keep the name under wraps for now. Hold your ground with the no baby name talk rule.", "Your twin sister seems like she is the one with bad taste. Out of the four people mentioned in the story, she is the sole outlier in terms of absolutely hating suggested baby names.

I feel you!", "Yeah, it happened to my friend when she was pregnant. She and her wife had like five names they had narrowed it down to, all got shit on by different people and left them deflated. Never wanted that to happen. People are less likely to be rude once the baby is here. Usually.", "Seems like that's her idea.", "I think it's more than the pregnancy hormones. I know my sister made some littles notes over the years of baby names. If all of those are names her husband doesn't like then I could see it being a bitter pill for her to swallow. Especially with such different names they like.", "My sister has written notes with names over the years she loved. I wonder if all of those are names her husband vetoed and she's now angry that she doesn't get to use one of those dream names. It could also be some kind of panic too. Especially because she's due soonish and they are no closer to a name.", "That wasn't exactly the question I asked here. You can still talk names and not let someone choose. I ended all talk of baby names with her which I wondered was a little much.", "If that's true then your sister may very well be panicking. Especially if, as you say, she spent so much time focusing on a specific set of \"dream names\". Not knowing anything about her husband, I assume he likely simply didn't like the names. Not sure he'd have vetoed every one if he'd known how long she'd been thinking of some of them. Plus, if this is her first baby, the whole baby name thing could just be a small focus for all of the pent up pregnancy and motherhood stress she's feeling. \n\nDoes you're sister often snoop to you're knowledge or is this thing with your husbands computer out of character for her?", ">She told me the decision needed to be made and our sons would be George (hers) and Henry (mine) and I said no. She got huffy and I told her we needed to stop talking baby names.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back was her trying to name your baby which obviously is not okay. Literally nobody is going to fault you for this and I think you already knew that before you posted. I think you just want people to talk about how out of line your sister is.", "It's out of character for her. We normally do get along well and she's normally not this invasive. But she can be very strong on her opinions which can be an issue sometimes. Nothing like what's going on now.", "In that case then it's likely not just about the baby names. Being strong minded alone probably wouldn't be enough to make her snoop by itself. So it could just be that, with the due date approaching and no name picked out, she's feeling a bit overwhelmed.", "NTA - but don't let her get access to any of your planned names anymore. Otherwise expect her to hijack your favorite name.\n\nOf course, you can always share names that you are 100% certain that you will never use.", "NTA. You need some space from your sister. She is freaking out about being so close to her due date and not having a name. Her going through your husband's computer was really crossing a line. Talk to her less often and whenever she brings up names, tell her you have to go. You don't need to eat her crazy, just because she's dishing it up.", "NTA\n\nThe ONLY reason you should be comparing names is to ensure that you don\u2019t end up with Geoffrey/Jeffrey or Sean/Shaun. That happened in my family (not Geoffrey or Sean but a similar boys name with two identically pronounced versions) - both boys have the same family name, and are just two years apart. Luckily they are only third cousins, but they live close enough to each other and there is only 2 years between them so I am sure their paths will cross at some stage. My cousin\u2019s grandson (the older boy) actually lived in my village whilst the father of the younger boy was also living here. Luckily the younger boy lived with his mother and so was only here at weekends.", "NTA\nYour sister is super controlling! You are the first sane person I have seen on Reddit when it comes to baby names: keep them to yourself and name your baby as you choose.", "NTA.  Your sister has a weird hang-up about this it seems.  Your better off not talking about it like you suggested to her already.", "Nta", "My husband and I fell in love with a name for our youngest, but allowed pressure from both sets of grandparents to get to us, and we changed it. My youngest is now 15 and I still regret it to this day. Ironically, my kid loves that name. (Although they go by a completely different name from either of them that they picked out.) You and your DH should stick with your decisions and tell your sister that she had nothing to do with making the baby so she doesn't get to name it.", "Just checking, is it acceptable to slap a pregnant woman if you are also a pregnant woman? Family dynamics are weird but obviously NTA. She must have some delusion going about how you are going to raise your babies together or something .", "NTA. That is not something you should be doing as sisters. It\u2019s something you are already doing right by choosing with your husband. Ask your sister if she would be willing to name her baby something she and her husband both dislike for YOUR sake. I\u2019d bet real actual money that she would consider the idea an offense.", "NTA.  She should be ashamed of herself for snooping.  And she has no say in your names.  I do have a suggestion that you can pass on to her.  She and her husband should each make a list of 5 names they like.  Then compare the lists.  If there is a name that is on both lists, that's the name they should go with.  If not, then all those names are out and the each make new lists with new names.  Repeat as often as needed.

I'm sure the hospital will be happy to let her fill out the birth certificate for you /s\n\nNTA. Name your kid whatever you want. It sucks for her that she and her husband can't agree (may I suggest r/namenerds?), but that's not your problem and you're not an asshole for telling her you're done talking about it, especially after she violated your privacy by snooping on your husband's computer. (Who does that?!)", "NTA. She acts like a Bernadette.\n\nI don't know whooooo she thinks she is, but she doesn't get to decide what name you choose for your baby. Her husband and she need to get on the same page and leave you and your husband out of it. Sucks to suck, but she does suck.", "NTA", "Who doesn\u2019t have their electronics password protected? Your sister is TA but you already know that, snooping through your husbands computer is beyond the pale. Also she sounds super annoying. Congratulations to the both of you on your upcoming babies though!

If she's trying to be this controlling with you, I can already imagine the hell it's going to be as her child.", "NTA: baby names can be a big deal and people reaction in such a crazy variety of ways. I recommend to everyone just never talk names. My sister had two kids and both time never allowed anyone to discuss, guess or suggest baby names. both of her kids have great names that fit them. My other sister had a baby and was set a names until they met the baby, then suddenly a totally different name was what popped into her head and was chosen. \n\n\nIt's great you sister wants to be so evolved with your future kid but having the boundary of no more name discussion is great and healthy.", "Your sis is unbelievable.  Does she really think you're just going to name your child without your husband's input?  AND she wants to be the one to name your child?  Who cares what names she doesn't like, it's not her kid & she has no say in the matter.  But keep those names private.  I learned that lesson after my first kid.  Everyone is going to have an opinion, & the ONLY opinion that matters are yours & your husband's.  Good luck.  NTA", "NTA.  And WTF is this?! Your sister is delusional on so many levels.  She\u2019s controlling, clearly. I also hate the fact that just because she is having issues with her own husband, she expects you to take issue with your husband and turn on him. For your shared baby. Is she generally this dramatic, self centred and controlling? Also curious - was she born first? In any case, boundaries are required here as she has none. Clearly you do not have the same view ps about your relationship. And the fact that she views your asserting some space over this as not having her back says it all. Boundaries (maybe implicitly here because it sounds like she won\u2019t take it well if you are explicit and it will only be a hassle) and some lesser communication is best here, I think. Wishing you all the best for the rest of your pregnancy, and please take whatever steps you feel you need to keep it peaceful and happy. \n\nAlso, Brynn is such a beautiful name. And I would love for her to go to Wales and say out loud that Brynn is a shitty name.", "NTA\n\nIt's too bad your sister is such a asshole bc it would've been nice for your kids to be close (since they'll biologically half-siblings, it'd be a special thing for them) I really hope she's not one of those people who thinks every modern name is gross and only ultra dated names are acceptable", "NTA. He's your son, the only people who should have a say are you and your husband.

Not as much as the names her husband likes but still they'd never work for her. I won't be talking names with her anymore. Not after this.", "I've had some family members end up being one of multiple kids with the same name in their classes. None of them really liked that which I always took on board. I do admit my taste can be considered trendy. Though I try to find names that are not. I love a unisex nature name and I love something that is new and fresh but not hard to spell.

Still, I think your idea of not talking about it anymore is best, given how she doesn\u2019t want to talk about just her names and has gone all the way to saying she will choose for you also.

Hopefully it will die down. \n\nAnd not that my opinion matters, but if you love Brynn, I have faith in your shortlist :)", "Some people have called me Bryan lol.
