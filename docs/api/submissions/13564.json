My husband and I hadn't got any solid names for our baby at the time (now we know we're also expecting a boy) so I just told her some names I like and she talked about the names she liked that her husband said no to.

I said it was something my husband and I could talk about.\n\nSecond time we talked baby names and she was more annoyed because she said her husband liked hideous names and didn't appreciate any of the gorgeous choices she liked. I suggested an app I'd heard about to her (sort of like Tinder for baby names) and she was like no, that won't work, he doesn't have any taste and only wants trendy ugly names.

(Biggest joke I got was \"will you name your kids \"China\", \"India\", \"Korea\", etc, because \"they came from you\"... Bet you can guess my name now, but the spelling is a doozy lol)\n\nI purposefully named my son something that wasn't on the \"top 1000 names\" of 2022 when he was born in late February & people either love the name or hate it, there is no in-between. As a clue, my son's name means \"Sea Fortress\" in Welsh & his name is pretty famous. I love the name, my partner loves the name (he wanted our son's name to be Charles after his dad, but that's his middle name now lol) & he couldn't believe I was nerdy enough to give our son his name. \n\nNo one should dictate what you want to name your kid, but people are allowed to disagree with it. Personally, I didn't want a \"John\", \"Robert\", \"Sam\", or any \"normal name\", but I also didn't want a trending \"unconventional\" name like \"River\". \n\nIt's not my kid, I don't get to dictate other parents choices, but if they're naming their kid something super dumb (read a post recently about someone naming their kid \"Cowboy\") or the spelling REALLY doesn't make sense (Cxssxdy - Cassidy), I will step in & say something regarding it, otherwise not my monkey not my circus.\n\nName your kid whatever you are happiest with & don't let anyone tell you to change it without good reason (ie. It's the most popular name & you will have your child being \"Henry K\" with five other Henry's in his class.

Your sister sounds mentally unstable.  I feel bad for her husband, who made the questionable choice of having a child with this woman.  She sounds like a true narcissist.", "NTA. Your sister is projecting and crossing boundaries. The fact that she snooped on your husband\u2019s laptop is incredibly disturbing. I cannot even fathom one of my siblings doing that.", "NTA You tried to as sisters. She and her husband rejected everything you came up with. Lastly she snooped when she shouldn't have and had the nerve to tell you she hated those names. And now she shocked that you don't want to continue this anymore? She needs to find names she and her husband like for their baby and leave you alone when it comes to naming yours.", "NTA.  How entitled do you have to be to think you can name someone else's child? And to violate your privacy by snooping?\n\n And frankly, though I like both yours and your sister's names, I do like yours better.", "NTA. Just because you\u2019re twins doesn\u2019t mean she gets to control what you do. That\u2019s crazy, and refraining from even talking about names seems like the way to go. Is she going to be this controlling and entitled with your child?\n\nUm, I feel like you\u2019re just breezing over the fact that she snooped on your husband\u2019s computer! If you\u2019re not being very direct with her and telling her that is completely unacceptable, then you\u2019re not doing yourself or your family any favors.", "NTA. She snooped through your husbands laptop and thinks she can name your child? Yeah she has some serious boundary issues.", "NTA. Being twins doesn't give her naming rights for your child.\n\nShe has atrocious boundaries and you need to keep your electronics password protected unless you posted the baby names online.\n\nI'd be wary of her, next she'll want identical nurseries or something", "NTA and also wtf. this is so beyond obsessive and strange ...", "NTA.  First, it's not any of her business. \n\n Second I think as a twin your sister has attachment and control issues regarding her relationship with you. She wants you and her to prioritize your sibling relationship over your relationships with your spouses.", "NTA. Has the pregnancy hormones made your sister a little crazy? She gets NO opinion on what you & your hubby decided to name your child. And to snooped on your husband's laptop! Yea, no more baby name talk with the sister.", "NTA. I'm afraid you're sister may have some kind of insecurity about her name and is projecting that onto both your babies. Or alternatively she may want to take some kind of control over something and this is the thing she's decided to try and control. Not really sure.\n\nIt could also be simply shes have a bit of a new mom panic. Some new mothers I've met get into a 'mode' where they feel every decision for their future baby needs to be 'perfect' right down to the name. This has even led some to do things like what you're sister did with the snooping. \n\nPoint being, enforce the no baby name discussion rule, but don't stop discussing other things with your sister. It's possible this whole name thing is just the symptom of other insecurities you're sister might have as a new mother.", "NTA I see you sister trying to persuade you to dress your children in cutesy matchty-matchy outfits in the future. Somethings you need to nip in the bud and trying to control the name of your baby is a good place to start.", "NTA. Your sister has no right to name your baby. Seems like she's scrambling since she can't have any of her \"dream names\" due to her husband vetoing them and is trying to control you instead. It's a HUGE violation of privacy that she looked through your husband's laptop to find your name last, instead of respecting your wishes to keep the name under wraps for now. Hold your ground with the no baby name talk rule.", "Your twin sister seems like she is the one with bad taste. Out of the four people mentioned in the story, she is the sole outlier in terms of absolutely hating suggested baby names.

I feel you!", "Yeah, it happened to my friend when she was pregnant. She and her wife had like five names they had narrowed it down to, all got shit on by different people and left them deflated. Never wanted that to happen. People are less likely to be rude once the baby is here. Usually.", "Seems like that's her idea.", "I think it's more than the pregnancy hormones. I know my sister made some littles notes over the years of baby names. If all of those are names her husband doesn't like then I could see it being a bitter pill for her to swallow. Especially with such different names they like.", "My sister has written notes with names over the years she loved. I wonder if all of those are names her husband vetoed and she's now angry that she doesn't get to use one of those dream names. It could also be some kind of panic too. Especially because she's due soonish and they are no closer to a name.", "That wasn't exactly the question I asked here. You can still talk names and not let someone choose. I ended all talk of baby names with her which I wondered was a little much.", "If that's true then your sister may very well be panicking. Especially if, as you say, she spent so much time focusing on a specific set of \"dream names\". Not knowing anything about her husband, I assume he likely simply didn't like the names. Not sure he'd have vetoed every one if he'd known how long she'd been thinking of some of them. Plus, if this is her first baby, the whole baby name thing could just be a small focus for all of the pent up pregnancy and motherhood stress she's feeling. \n\nDoes you're sister often snoop to you're knowledge or is this thing with your husbands computer out of character for her?", ">She told me the decision needed to be made and our sons would be George (hers) and Henry (mine) and I said no. She got huffy and I told her we needed to stop talking baby names.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back was her trying to name your baby which obviously is not okay. Literally nobody is going to fault you for this and I think you already knew that before you posted. I think you just want people to talk about how out of line your sister is.", "It's out of character for her. We normally do get along well and she's normally not this invasive. But she can be very strong on her opinions which can be an issue sometimes. Nothing like what's going on now.", "In that case then it's likely not just about the baby names. Being strong minded alone probably wouldn't be enough to make her snoop by itself. So it could just be that, with the due date approaching and no name picked out, she's feeling a bit overwhelmed.", "NTA - but don't let her get access to any of your planned names anymore. Otherwise expect her to hijack your favorite name.\n\nOf course, you can always share names that you are 100% certain that you will never use.", "NTA. You need some space from your sister. She is freaking out about being so close to her due date and not having a name. Her going through your husband's computer was really crossing a line. Talk to her less often and whenever she brings up names, tell her you have to go. You don't need to eat her crazy, just because she's dishing it up.", "NTA\n\nThe ONLY reason you should be comparing names is to ensure that you don\u2019t end up with Geoffrey/Jeffrey or Sean/Shaun. That happened in my family (not Geoffrey or Sean but a similar boys name with two identically pronounced versions) - both boys have the same family name, and are just two years apart. Luckily they are only third cousins, but they live close enough to each other and there is only 2 years between them so I am sure their paths will cross at some stage. My cousin\u2019s grandson (the older boy) actually lived in my village whilst the father of the younger boy was also living here. Luckily the younger boy lived with his mother and so was only here at weekends.", "NTA\nYour sister is super controlling! You are the first sane person I have seen on Reddit when it comes to baby names: keep them to yourself and name your baby as you choose.", "NTA.  Your sister has a weird hang-up about this it seems.  Your better off not talking about it like you suggested to her already.", "Nta", "My husband and I fell in love with a name for our youngest, but allowed pressure from both sets of grandparents to get to us, and we changed it. My youngest is now 15 and I still regret it to this day. Ironically, my kid loves that name. (Although they go by a completely different name from either of them that they picked out.) You and your DH should stick with your decisions and tell your sister that she had nothing to do with making the baby so she doesn't get to name it.", "Just checking, is it acceptable to slap a pregnant woman if you are also a pregnant woman? Family dynamics are weird but obviously NTA. She must have some delusion going about how you are going to raise your babies together or something .", "NTA. That is not something you should be doing as sisters. It\u2019s something you are already doing right by choosing with your husband. Ask your sister if she would be willing to name her baby something she and her husband both dislike for YOUR sake. I\u2019d bet real actual money that she would consider the idea an offense.", "NTA.  She should be ashamed of herself for snooping.  And she has no say in your names.  I do have a suggestion that you can pass on to her.  She and her husband should each make a list of 5 names they like.  Then compare the lists.  If there is a name that is on both lists, that's the name they should go with.  If not, then all those names are out and the each make new lists with new names.  Repeat as often as needed.

I'm sure the hospital will be happy to let her fill out the birth certificate for you /s\n\nNTA. Name your kid whatever you want. It sucks for her that she and her husband can't agree (may I suggest r/namenerds?), but that's not your problem and you're not an asshole for telling her you're done talking about it, especially after she violated your privacy by snooping on your husband's computer. (Who does that?!)", "NTA. She acts like a Bernadette.\n\nI don't know whooooo she thinks she is, but she doesn't get to decide what name you choose for your baby. Her husband and she need to get on the same page and leave you and your husband out of it. Sucks to suck, but she does suck.", "NTA", "Who doesn\u2019t have their electronics password protected?

If she's trying to be this controlling with you, I can already imagine the hell it's going to be as her child.", "NTA: baby names can be a big deal and people reaction in such a crazy variety of ways. I recommend to everyone just never talk names. My sister had two kids and both time never allowed anyone to discuss, guess or suggest baby names. both of her kids have great names that fit them. My other sister had a baby and was set a names until they met the baby, then suddenly a totally different name was what popped into her head and was chosen. \n\n\nIt's great you sister wants to be so evolved with your future kid but having the boundary of no more name discussion is great and healthy.", "Your sis is unbelievable.  Does she really think you're just going to name your child without your husband's input?  AND she wants to be the one to name your child?  Who cares what names she doesn't like, it's not her kid & she has no say in the matter.  But keep those names private.  I learned that lesson after my first kid.  Everyone is going to have an opinion, & the ONLY opinion that matters are yours & your husband's.  Good luck.  NTA", "NTA.  And WTF is this?! Your sister is delusional on so many levels.  She\u2019s controlling, clearly. I also hate the fact that just because she is having issues with her own husband, she expects you to take issue with your husband and turn on him. For your shared baby. Is she generally this dramatic, self centred and controlling? Also curious - was she born first? In any case, boundaries are required here as she has none. Clearly you do not have the same view ps about your relationship. And the fact that she views your asserting some space over this as not having her back says it all. Boundaries (maybe implicitly here because it sounds like she won\u2019t take it well if you are explicit and it will only be a hassle) and some lesser communication is best here, I think. Wishing you all the best for the rest of your pregnancy, and please take whatever steps you feel you need to keep it peaceful and happy. \n\nAlso, Brynn is such a beautiful name. And I would love for her to go to Wales and say out loud that Brynn is a shitty name.", "NTA\n\nIt's too bad your sister is such a asshole bc it would've been nice for your kids to be close (since they'll biologically half-siblings, it'd be a special thing for them) I really hope she's not one of those people who thinks every modern name is gross and only ultra dated names are acceptable", "NTA. He's your son, the only people who should have a say are you and your husband.

I do admit my taste can be considered trendy. Though I try to find names that are not. I love a unisex nature name and I love something that is new and fresh but not hard to spell.

I guess maybe you can chalk it up to her name being vetoed plus pregnancy hormones.  Still, I think your idea of not talking about it anymore is best, given how she doesn\u2019t want to talk about just her names and has gone all the way to saying she will choose for you also.

Hopefully it will die down. \n\nAnd not that my opinion matters, but if you love Brynn, I have faith in your shortlist :)", "Some people have called me Bryan lol.

Going through your husband\u2019s computer is way over the line. \n\nI suspect she is going to want you to dress your children alike and that the children have to everything together. But of course, she has to decide on outfits and activities because only she has good taste. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour sister, MIL, mother, father, brother, cousin, aunts, uncles, the mailman and strangers on the street DO NOT get to name your baby. That's up to you and your husband. Your sister is way off base, and it doesn't matter that you're twins. That she was snooping on your computer is going too far. Nip this in the bud, OP. No more name discussions, or anything else that is invasive from your sister.", "Well, Henry is actually a beautiful name in my opinion.", "So she's going a \"royal\" with the names?  If it shuts her up..  I'd agree and move on.  Then when the kids born, name it whatever you want\n\nMight want to explain to her, that snooping is disrespectful and she needs to stop", "NTA. HUH??? She told you what your baby\u2019s name would be? As if you\u2019re obligated to follow that?", "If it's because you're sisters, why shouldn't she have YOUR back?\n\nNTA and wow, you lasted longer with her than I would have!", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019re sister is delusional.", "NTA. You should also mention to your sister that your child is not hers. Im betting she sees both kids as hers since you are twins.", "NTA - Wow, can\u2019t believe she had the audacity to name YOUR baby. If I were you, I would go NC.", "I mean she's your twin, but she shouldn't be in charge of you", "NTA\n\nYou will always be sisters but now you both are married with children on the way and she has been replaced.\n\nMaybe that is what she is upset about now. Being replaced and being put first.", "NTA \n\nIf she thinks the names she comes up with a perfect, the names her husband comes up with are awful, and the names you and your husband come up with are awful; It sounds like it may actually be her taste in names that is bad.

Does she like royalty, per chance?\n\nNTA. \n\nShe would not be invited back into my home after the snooping incident. Does she have a positive relationship with your husband? I get the feeling she may resent what she sees as his 'influence' tainting your twin bond.", "NTA, and also my middle name is Brynn and I love it!", "NTA. She would not be back in my house for awhile. She snooped on your husband's computer. Talk about having no boundaries. She also sounds pushy. I would step way back from her  for awhile.  You may be twins but that does not mean you aren't individuals.", "NTA, I loathe discussing baby names for my kids with anyone other then my spouse. \n\nI can't even pinpoint why, but it's extremely irritating. I think partly because I want the decision to stay between me and my husband..and I don't care for other people dominating the conversation or judging our choices. \n\nOP, set your boundary and then enforce it. Don't even entertain the conversation. Hang up, leave, stop answering texts when she brings it up.", "NTA. It\u2019s so weird she\u2019s pressing this. They\u2019re cousins, not siblings. I like both sisters\u2019 names tbh.", "I would consider her name a little more antiquated that others and I think she might have a complex about it considering her husband only likes \"ugly modern\" names.\n\nI think she's projecting about something - can't exactly figure out what it is tho. Just focus on your kid and she can focus on hers. Your kids are cousins, not siblings.", "right, absolutely batshit", "Got to say, I also question how much she actually respect her husband if she\u2019s not even willing to try to compromise a name for THEIR child.

We announced when I was 30 weeks. Next time I probably will only announce I\u2019m pregnant around 30 weeks and names will be kept away from everyone til baby is born.", "Don't disagree but I work where you see a lot of kids names. And some of them make you cringe because you know exactly how much bullying those poor little kids are going to suffer through their school life.", "I \\*loathed\\* being one of the army of Jennifers in GenX.

My sister\u2019s last child was born around Christmas and I teased her that Ebenezer was the perfect name!

When I was talking baby names with my sister she got huffy that I was considering a few family names. She thought I should be considerate of her in case she wanted to use one of the names.   They weren\u2019t a name she had been dead set on forever.   \u201cOh Im totally set on using dads middle name fyi.  If you use it the kids will have the same name\u201d that wouldn\u2019t have bothered me.  But I was supposed to get her approval before I used a name she might want to potentially use in the future.  People are fucking weirdly entitled about shit.", "NTA. Has she always been like this, or is this some kind of reaction to pregnancy? Because your sister sounds very much like a bully.", "NTA.\n\nShe can't even get her husband to agree with the names she likes, so she's bringing a purely marital disagreement out of the relationship to marshal support from her twin because she wants to get more people on her side to retake control. \n\nThe best thing you can do now that you see the extent of your differing views on this is to do exactly what you did - not talk to her about this. \n\nHer snooping was also way out of line, I have to say.", "NTA\n\nLike you told her, you and your hubba are the ones deciding the name.\n\nShe sounds exhausting! Does she usually try to do everything with you and you're more independent?", "NTA. Wut? This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. The audacity of your sister. The auDAcity.", "I'm not sure if I should vote YTA or NTA cause your reaction to learning your sister going through your husband's computer was not enough. Do you understand how f'ed up that is? It's not up to her to decide and she is only asking to name them as only you two cause her husband isn't on board with hers. She is jealous of you being on board with yours. Your husband deserves and apology. And it's your job to have your husband's back. Do better for your own family.", "NTA. Is she the more dominant twin out of the two of you?\n\nIt sounds like she is trying to assert herself because she can\u2019t with her husband so she\u2019s doing it to you. \n\nOP, you need to start setting boundaries with her. For one thing it\u2019s immoral to snoop around someone else\u2019s home and to search for info. It\u2019s another to be so insulting and I would stop contacting her about baby stuff and that includes venting.", "Seems like she doesn\u2019t fully grasp that you are two separate people?

Please don't feel guilty about saying that directly in her face if she ever brings that up again.\n\nAnd bitching on your name is so not cool. I too think Bryn(n) is cute - it's actually traditional a welsh name for boys... but I know Americans like to use it for girls and have therefore decided it's unisex \ud83d\ude02... I am totally not against it (not that it'd matter the slightest if I would be, lol, as long as you like it), and I do think it rolls nice for girls too.

Yes you are twins (I assume identical?), but one has to draw the line somewhere.\n\nAlso, WTF is she sneaking on your husband's computer?!  That is a privacy violation right there.", "Personally I think your sister got the short stick in terms of names. Bernadette is such a horrid name where as Brynn is short, sweet and cute.\n\nNTA - Your sister needs to learn how to compromise with her husband.", "No. Your sister is. You communicated a boundary. Your sister needs to learn to not cross those boundaries.", "For one, Brynn is a far cuter name than Bernadette. Two, it seems like your sister has realized she\u2019s having a baby with a man that she can\u2019t even agree on baby names with and is now feeling the need to ruffle the feathers within your own relationship so she doesn\u2019t feel so alone in her struggles. Honestly, it seems like she has that weird obsession that some twins have on wanting you two to be eerily alike just because y\u2019all are twins. It seems to really be getting under her skin that, although y\u2019all are twins, you manage to find a man that you can agree on things with and her and her man don\u2019t seem to agree on anything besides getting pregnant. You need to set up some serious boundaries with her. It won\u2019t just stop at baby names.

I will be having the mother son dance at his wedding!", "Laser sharp focus, obviously, lol", "Brynn actually doesn't exist in Welsh, someone from the US just decided to add an extra \"n\". There is no female version of the name Bryn in Welsh.\n\nAnd because Bryn is a boys names traditionally, adding and extra \"n\" doesn't make the name female.

Your sister sounds like quite, a lot, and is way overstepping. Lol I don\u2019t understand why she thinks she should have any say over what you name your kid.

And then to go through your things to find the list of names you and your husband agreed on, insult the names, tell you that she already decided what your son will be called, along with hers, and then insult your dad AND your name is all too much.

Don\u2019t like it? Tough, it\u2019s already his name. I heard third hand that one person thought we should have done a variation of the name we used instead but I never heard it directly from them.
