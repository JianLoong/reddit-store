She's due about a month before me. And she's having trouble finding a name for her son with her husband. So she wanted to talk baby names on a few occasions and suggested we could help each other. I said we could talk baby names, sure, but I'd leave finding names for my husband and I. She was fine with that. My husband and I hadn't got any solid names for our baby at the time (now we know we're also expecting a boy) so I just told her some names I like and she talked about the names she liked that her husband said no to. That first time she made some comments about how I should name my baby something so he and his cousin would be closer in names than we ever were as sisters (she's Bernadette after our grandmother and I'm Brynn because my dad thought it was a fun, cute name). I said it was something my husband and I could talk about.\n\nSecond time we talked baby names and she was more annoyed because she said her husband liked hideous names and didn't appreciate any of the gorgeous choices she liked. I suggested an app I'd heard about to her (sort of like Tinder for baby names) and she was like no, that won't work, he doesn't have any taste and only wants trendy ugly names. She wanted me to agree that we'd just name our babies ourselves and I said my husband and I actually had a short list we'd agreed on. She was upset about that and asked how and I told her we liked the same names. She wanted to know the names and I said we were going to keep them quiet so nobody could talk us out of any of them/spoil them for us. She said she'd never do that since we're twins, we clearly will have the same style. I changed the topic and moved onto letting her vent about her troubles.\n\nWhat I didn't know is she snooped and found a digital list my husband had left on his laptop and she hated all of them, which I knew she would. She then decided she was going to take the reigns. She told me the names we had chosen so far were awful, not far off her husband's shitty taste and I told her it's our taste and she needs to learn that hers isn't the only taste in names and she should respect it. She said I was as bad as dad. I told her I loved my name and was happy with what he chose for me. She told me the decision needed to be made and our sons would be George (hers) and Henry (mine) and I said no. She got huffy and I told her we needed to stop talking baby names. To say she was shocked would be an understatement and she asked why. I told her I didn't want to talk baby names with her anymore.

Nta and maybe you need to take some time to rethink your relationship with your sister. She cannot decide over you, she shouldn\u2019t undermine your husband\u2019s input. You are twins but you are still two individuals with their own interests and lives. And that should be respected. Btw, Brynn is a very nice name!", "NTA. I'm someone who picked somewhat old-fashioned/atypical names for our kids, and I purposefully did not talk names with anyone before birth (well, besides my husband of course, since we picked names together as a team). I didn't even find out the sex of the babies. Life is too short to get stressed out by other people's projections, even close family (well, sometimes especially close family).", "NTA .. Why does your Twin think she gets a say in your Baby's name ?", "NTA- You both can name your kids whatever you want, but she doesn't have the right to tell you what to name your kid. Also, I think it's horrible that she snooped through your computer to find the baby name list", "Your child\u2019s name is you and your husbands decision only. I frankly find it hilarious that she thinks she can name your child. Good on you guys for keeping the list secret, I know that I would be thrown for a loop if I heard any opinions about my child\u2019s name before it was solidified. NTA", "NTA. Just because you're twins doesn't mean you have to share everything together. It may have felt like that when you were younger (to either or both of you), but you're your own individual people with your own families. It seems your sister is lacking that understanding and respect for you and any boundaries you may be setting for yourself and your family. May be a tough thing for her to accept, but that's not your responsibility.", "NTA its your kid name it what you want, if your sister doesnt like it tough", "NTA.\n\nShe snooped through your husband's laptop to find the names and then insulted your choices. She needs to mind her own business.", "NTA. Sister has some serious codependency issues with you and is trying to mask it as \"twin\" intuition. She isn't respecting boundaries either.", "Obviously, NTA.\n\nThis is not something you do as sisters... This is something you do within oyur own marriage, with your partner. \n\nIt is unfortunate that she doesn't agree with her husband's name choices, but she has absolutely zero say in yours, despite you being twins.", ">She told me I should have her back and this is something we should be doing as sisters.\n\nSo in her mind, doing this as sisters means she gets to insult your choices and dictate to you what to name your child, and you just obey her?\n\nYou're NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

(Biggest joke I got was \"will you name your kids \"China\", \"India\", \"Korea\", etc, because \"they came from you\"... Bet you can guess my name now, but the spelling is a doozy lol)\n\nI purposefully named my son something that wasn't on the \"top 1000 names\" of 2022 when he was born in late February & people either love the name or hate it, there is no in-between. As a clue, my son's name means \"Sea Fortress\" in Welsh & his name is pretty famous. I love the name, my partner loves the name (he wanted our son's name to be Charles after his dad, but that's his middle name now lol) & he couldn't believe I was nerdy enough to give our son his name. \n\nNo one should dictate what you want to name your kid, but people are allowed to disagree with it. Personally, I didn't want a \"John\", \"Robert\", \"Sam\", or any \"normal name\", but I also didn't want a trending \"unconventional\" name like \"River\". \n\nIt's not my kid, I don't get to dictate other parents choices, but if they're naming their kid something super dumb (read a post recently about someone naming their kid \"Cowboy\") or the spelling REALLY doesn't make sense (Cxssxdy - Cassidy), I will step in & say something regarding it, otherwise not my monkey not my circus.\n\nName your kid whatever you are happiest with & don't let anyone tell you to change it without good reason (ie. It's the most popular name & you will have your child being \"Henry K\" with five other Henry's in his class. This happened with my little cousin when he was born in the year of the \"Aidan\"/\"Aiden\"/\"Aden\"/etc & my aunt wishes she had chosen a different name after realizing this).\n\nBest of luck & congratulations on your little boy!", "wow NTA she sounds insane", "NTA.  Your sister sounds mentally unstable.  I feel bad for her husband, who made the questionable choice of having a child with this woman.  She sounds like a true narcissist.", "NTA. Your sister is projecting and crossing boundaries. The fact that she snooped on your husband\u2019s laptop is incredibly disturbing. I cannot even fathom one of my siblings doing that.", "NTA You tried to as sisters. She and her husband rejected everything you came up with. Lastly she snooped when she shouldn't have and had the nerve to tell you she hated those names. And now she shocked that you don't want to continue this anymore? She needs to find names she and her husband like for their baby and leave you alone when it comes to naming yours.", "NTA.  How entitled do you have to be to think you can name someone else's child? And to violate your privacy by snooping?\n\n And frankly, though I like both yours and your sister's names, I do like yours better.", "NTA. Just because you\u2019re twins doesn\u2019t mean she gets to control what you do. That\u2019s crazy, and refraining from even talking about names seems like the way to go. Is she going to be this controlling and entitled with your child?\n\nUm, I feel like you\u2019re just breezing over the fact that she snooped on your husband\u2019s computer! If you\u2019re not being very direct with her and telling her that is completely unacceptable, then you\u2019re not doing yourself or your family any favors.", "NTA. She snooped through your husbands laptop and thinks she can name your child? Yeah she has some serious boundary issues.", "NTA. Being twins doesn't give her naming rights for your child.\n\nShe has atrocious boundaries and you need to keep your electronics password protected unless you posted the baby names online.\n\nI'd be wary of her, next she'll want identical nurseries or something", "NTA and also wtf. this is so beyond obsessive and strange ...", "NTA.  First, it's not any of her business. \n\n Second I think as a twin your sister has attachment and control issues regarding her relationship with you. She wants you and her to prioritize your sibling relationship over your relationships with your spouses.", "NTA. Has the pregnancy hormones made your sister a little crazy? She gets NO opinion on what you & your hubby decided to name your child. And to snooped on your husband's laptop! Yea, no more baby name talk with the sister.", "NTA. I'm afraid you're sister may have some kind of insecurity about her name and is projecting that onto both your babies. Or alternatively she may want to take some kind of control over something and this is the thing she's decided to try and control. Not really sure.\n\nIt could also be simply shes have a bit of a new mom panic. Some new mothers I've met get into a 'mode' where they feel every decision for their future baby needs to be 'perfect' right down to the name. This has even led some to do things like what you're sister did with the snooping. \n\nPoint being, enforce the no baby name discussion rule, but don't stop discussing other things with your sister. It's possible this whole name thing is just the symptom of other insecurities you're sister might have as a new mother.", "NTA I see you sister trying to persuade you to dress your children in cutesy matchty-matchy outfits in the future. Somethings you need to nip in the bud and trying to control the name of your baby is a good place to start.", "NTA. Your sister has no right to name your baby. Seems like she's scrambling since she can't have any of her \"dream names\" due to her husband vetoing them and is trying to control you instead. It's a HUGE violation of privacy that she looked through your husband's laptop to find your name last, instead of respecting your wishes to keep the name under wraps for now. Hold your ground with the no baby name talk rule.", "Your twin sister seems like she is the one with bad taste. Out of the four people mentioned in the story, she is the sole outlier in terms of absolutely hating suggested baby names. I think regardless of any compromise, it would have to be her way or the highway. Just ignore her until you pick a name, she is being a child. NTA", "YTA for wasting our time with \"AITA for not letting my sister pick my baby's name\".", "NTA She is minding *your* business. It isn\u2019t *up* to her what you name *your* baby boy.\n\nAnd WTF she is *going through your husbands computer???* to find your list of names. Oh, *hell* no, that is beyond the pale.", "Thank you for saying that! I always loved my name.", "Family can be the worst for that stuff. I feel you!", "Yeah, it happened to my friend when she was pregnant. She and her wife had like five names they had narrowed it down to, all got shit on by different people and left them deflated. Never wanted that to happen. People are less likely to be rude once the baby is here. Usually.", "Seems like that's her idea.", "I think it's more than the pregnancy hormones. I know my sister made some littles notes over the years of baby names. If all of those are names her husband doesn't like then I could see it being a bitter pill for her to swallow. Especially with such different names they like.", "My sister has written notes with names over the years she loved. I wonder if all of those are names her husband vetoed and she's now angry that she doesn't get to use one of those dream names. It could also be some kind of panic too. Especially because she's due soonish and they are no closer to a name.", "That wasn't exactly the question I asked here. You can still talk names and not let someone choose. I ended all talk of baby names with her which I wondered was a little much.", "If that's true then your sister may very well be panicking. Especially if, as you say, she spent so much time focusing on a specific set of \"dream names\". Not knowing anything about her husband, I assume he likely simply didn't like the names. Not sure he'd have vetoed every one if he'd known how long she'd been thinking of some of them. Plus, if this is her first baby, the whole baby name thing could just be a small focus for all of the pent up pregnancy and motherhood stress she's feeling. \n\nDoes you're sister often snoop to you're knowledge or is this thing with your husbands computer out of character for her?", ">She told me the decision needed to be made and our sons would be George (hers) and Henry (mine) and I said no. She got huffy and I told her we needed to stop talking baby names.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back was her trying to name your baby which obviously is not okay. Literally nobody is going to fault you for this and I think you already knew that before you posted. I think you just want people to talk about how out of line your sister is.", "It's out of character for her. We normally do get along well and she's normally not this invasive. But she can be very strong on her opinions which can be an issue sometimes. Nothing like what's going on now.", "In that case then it's likely not just about the baby names. Being strong minded alone probably wouldn't be enough to make her snoop by itself. So it could just be that, with the due date approaching and no name picked out, she's feeling a bit overwhelmed."]}
