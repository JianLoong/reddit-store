I hope I\u2019m not TA, but my judgment towards my sister is biased.\n\nBack in 2020, my mom lost her job and I (34F) moved back in with her to pay the bills (I figure she earned it). My work hours are weird, as I work with people overseas from the US, and I work from home, from my computer, generally from the afternoon to about midnight. At the beginning of this year, my sister\u2019s (38F) rent was jacked up, and she couldn\u2019t afford her place anymore. She asked to move back in to our mom\u2019s home so her two kids (9M and 7F) could have space.\n\nTo keep it short, I don\u2019t get along with my sister. But I love my niece and nephew and agreed they could move in with three stipulations:\n\n1. Don\u2019t touch my food, which I labeled.\n\n2. No one touches the room I made my office.\n\n3. As I sleep late, no noise before ten in the morning.\n\nMy sister agreed to these, but it didn\u2019t take long before she started pushing. My food started disappearing. She was complaining about me getting two rooms when her kids had to share. And she would not stop making noise in the morning, saying \u201cthey\u2019re just kids!\u201d when I\u2019d yell at them to keep it down.\n\nIt culminated when I was woken up at eight thirty by the kids screeching outside my door, after I didn\u2019t get to sleep until three because, again, I was working. She told me to get a real job and join the real world, and we had a huge fight.\n\nI couldn\u2019t do it. I told my mom they had to leave. She reluctantly agreed. My sister apparently didn\u2019t realize I was paying the bills, and argued with me a lot. She didn\u2019t think it was serious until she was basically thrown out, and had to move in with our dad, who only has a two bedroom apartment.\n\nShe\u2019s still pissed, and started a fight about it over the holiday. Some of my aunts and uncles said I should have been more tolerant since now she and two kids are sharing one room in dad's apartment, but I'm pissed that I'm paying most of the bills and I wasn't allowed to keep my chips and soda to myself.

You're already trying to help take care of your mom, you are already doing more than you have to. You signed up to take care of *one* other person at your own expense; you do not have to take on more people, especially people who can't respect your boundaries and are blatantly disrespectful towards you.", "NTA She sounds exhausting. It doesn\u2019t seem like you have a good relationship. Letting her stay there may not have been a good idea.", "NTA. She broke the rules. Your family members that disagree can take them in.", "NTA, but with some caveats.\n\nNo noise before 10am is an impossible request for someone with kids. Everything else was perfectly reasonable.\n\nI also wake up at 10am, but could not reasonably expect silence after 8am when most of the rest of my society is awake and going about their jobs. \n\nOn the other hand it sounds like your sister completely ignored your rules **after** she agreed to them. For that reason you get the NTA and avoid ESH. She should have tried to reason with you rather than ignore it and break her agreement with you. But it also sounds like she was desperate because she had just been evicted and has kids seemingly without a partner to help take care.\n\nMaybe get some earplugs and a rumble alarm.

It\u2019s your food! \n\nYour room and office being out of bounds is also no issue. \n\nThe kids making no noise until 10 is literally unachievable. Kids are noisy. Unless you let them laze around on electronics - which is bad! Kids need to burn off that energy. You need ear plugs, white noise machine and to ignore the kids!\n\nYou also should have explained that you were paying the bills hence the two rooms!\n\nYour sisters can\u2019t expect the world to cater for her kids for free!

I never threatened anything.", "I know, but I insulted her too. I started to think my rules were unreasonable.", "It's her children that upset me. They really were being kids, except the last morning, when she was encouraging them to play upstairs outside my room. It's just so frustrating that she refused to make them be quiet in the early mornings.", "I don't think she's a bad mom. Ungrateful guest, yes, but not a bad mom.", "I was afraid they were too restrictive, too, but I need to work late/sleep late. I'm not sure there was another option other than them being quiet in the morning.", "I really thought she did know I was paying the bills. I mean, she knew my mom lost her job and I was paying rent. It may have been a poorly planned idea all around.", "Yeah, okay...", "CHILDREN CAN BE QUIET IF PARENTED CORRECTLY. I\u2019m so sick of people letting children do what they want because they think their children are too stupid or selfish or just some uncontrollable creatures that walk the earth. You just don\u2019t want to parent. Period.", "At ages 9 and 7, children are old enough to understand when to be quiet.", "No, it was my mistake assuming she'd finally act like an adult.", "Don't I wish. None of them live around here. Though I doubt they'd go through with it anyway.", "Very NTA now.\n\nApparently I missed the part where she encouraged them to play outside your room. That erases the ESH argument I had.", "The only rule I found unreasonable was no noise in the morning. They're kids, they have to get ready for school, they're gonna make some noise. You could have gotten some earplugs, a white noise machine, something. The other ones are completely reasonable and not hard to follow. NTA Your sister needs to grow up.", "She did it on purpose to make you upset. Now she is dealing with the consequences.", "You can\u2019t keep kids quiet. Kids are noisy. \n\nBut she encouraged them to play outside your door! That makes her an asshole. \n\nShe could have had them play away from your room and you could use a white noise app on your phone.", "Lol I think a mother who can\u2019t afford her rent and has her kids living in a two bedroom apartment with two other adults meets the definition of bad mom. Especially when she could have been living with you had she just had the sense to agree to your very reasonable stipulations.", "When she started whining about why did you get two rooms, you should have filled her in on the fact that you were paying the bills and needed the office to earn the money that was paying the bills. I'm guessing she thought you'd moved back home with Mom for the same reason she did - to save money.\n\nShe might have taken your rules more seriously had she realized that pulling your chain was not a good idea and could lead to her being kicked out. But then again she sounds very immature, so that might not have done any good.", "Even my kid brother, who was the poster child for ADHD back before they even called it that, was able to internalize rules about noise during the year our dad was on nights. That sucked, but we learned and cooperated.\n\nIt was on our mom to find us opportunities to blow off steam, and she did. When we were at home during dad\u2019s sleep time, she lowered the boom if we made noise in the hallway outside their room or under their bedroom windows. Actively encouraging us to play in the hallway would have been a nonstarter.", "NTA. \n\nThe rules weren\u2019t that hard. Any kid raised with a parent working night shifts KNOWS when to be quiet and why they have to. Even getting up early on weekends (without adult supervision), my siblings and I used to quietly play, watch TV, have some cereal and not wake up our parents.", "Yess that's totally fair. I can't think of another option. Unless the children are quite well behaved and are able to be kept busy until 10am. But the mom needs to make that effort and make sure that happens. Or she could take them for a walk early in the morning or park, but that can be too much", "Yeah idk about that. But nonetheless OP is NTA.", "I'm 100% sure you're correct. She always antagonized me growing up, and this is just more of that.", "Not being able to afford rent can come from different causes. Doesn't necessarily make someone a bad parent because they fell on tough luck.   \nAnd the reasonable stipulations are reasonable to adults, some of them not so much for children. It's quite hard to keep children quiet until 10 am. (now the food, they definitely could have stayed away from the food).", "I think that's why my mom agreed to kick them out. Most of my life, she's ignored the things my sister has done to me, but for the first time she was forced to actually see my sister being awful to me just for the sake of being awful. She was the only who saw what the kids were doing, yelled at them to go downstairs, then yelled at my sister for encouraging them. She knew I couldn't keep on with this with my job and agreed they had to leave.", "Us too, ironically. Though growing up, I was the one who got up early and she was the one who slept late.", "Children much younger than them are expected to be quiet while in school, why couldn't they have played quietly for a couple hours in the morning to respect the rules? It's not unreasonable for a 7 and 9 year old to behave.", "I agree OP is NTA. But I do know that the kids are old enough to understand how to be quiet. Children at age 5 learn to be quiet in school, sometimes even younger. Quiet doesn't mean they have to be completely silent.", "Don't let her move in again. Ever. If she can't respect you, she can't live with you.", "I disagree. If you have two kids and are not financially stable enough to house them on your own, you are a bad parent. Yeah and the stipulations were agreed to by an adult who should have done her part to keep the kids quiet during the agreed upon times. If she wasn\u2019t able to do that then she shouldn\u2019t have agreed to those terms and found somewhere else to live.", "I feel like it depends on the child. Some children are quieter and more well behaved than others. Some other children can be quite energetic so it can be harder to have them not make noise. Probably both parenting and temperament of the child can contribute to it.\n\nFor example you will tell some children to not make noise, but then they would forget at times and make noise and you have to keep reminding them sometimes. Although maybe not at 9 years old.\n\nBut that's a good point about school. Maybe it's just my experience then lool", "My point is that OP put herself in this situation, and that you really can't expect perfect behavior with children. Given OPs sleep schedule, the kids would certainly be out and about while she would be sleeping.", "Yep, really wish I thought of this seven months ago. Stupid me, thinking she'd finally be an adult.", "So parents who had some bad luck and subsequently lose their housing are by default bad parents? Because a lot of people are just one emergency away from falling below the poverty line. You can never have contingencies for everything that can happen unless you are so rich that none of that matters. Even people who planned ahead and have actual emergency funds can have the bad luck to run out of it before the tide turns and they can better themselves again. It does not make them bad parents. (not judging the specific case described here, just replying to the generalisation you made about what constitutes a bad parent).", "I agree, it obviously varies from child to child. My middle son is perfectly content to sit quietly and entertain himself while my youngest is a bouncing ball of energy. The children's mother should be responsible for making sure her children keep the noise at a reasonable level since it was agreed upon before they moved in. Take them outside to play if the weather's nice, turn on the TV in another part of the house at a reasonable volume, or do a craft project. Something. It sounds to me like the mom just didn't want to put in the effort, sadly.", "No. Parents just don\u2019t want to parent. My dad had overnight shift work some weeks and me and my siblings were quiet until we left or we played quietly in our rooms. I had empathy for my father and really wanted him to get some good sleep. EVEN AS A YOUNG CHILD. Stop acting like children are just some out of control creatures who can\u2019t help themselves. They can if parented correctly.", "True. I guess part of it also depends on how light of a sleeper OP is. I could sleep through a tornado, but other people wake up at the slightest sound. So maybe my definition of \"quiet\" would be different than others.", "In what world should someone who is \u201cone emergency away from homelessness or poverty\u201d be in charge of taking care of children? It\u2019s wildly irresponsible and shows a complete lack of foresight. Speaking as a child who grew up \u201c one emergency away\u201d from having my entire life upended, I can tell you it\u2019s not a great feeling.", ">So parents who had some bad luck and subsequently lose their housing are by default bad parents?\n\nAny parent who can't provide the needs of the child is by definition a bad parent.", "Yes it seems like the mom didn't take the sister's requests seriously as she felt the job wasn't a 'real job' for being remote. Which is completely wrong", "It seems like fewer and fewer parents are parenting.", "Ideally in no world, but unfortunately the way our society is being governed, it sadly a reality for a lot of people. And again, even parents who had the foresight to be more financially responsible can still fall on hard enough times that it becomes tough. No one has omnipotence, nor clairvoyance to prevent such situations.", "Are you suggesting anyone who isn't upper middle class shouldn't have children?", "Are you suggesting that people who can\u2019t even afford their rent for the month should have kids that are guaranteed to live paycheck to paycheck?", "63% of the United States *is* living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nSo I'll ask again: Do you think only the top 37% of the country should have children?"]}
