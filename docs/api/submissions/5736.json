My sister apparently didn\u2019t realize I was paying the bills, and argued with me a lot. She didn\u2019t think it was serious until she was basically thrown out, and had to move in with our dad, who only has a two bedroom apartment.\n\nShe\u2019s still pissed, and started a fight about it over the holiday.

That sucked, but we learned and cooperated.\n\nIt was on our mom to find us opportunities to blow off steam, and she did.

I can't think of another option. Unless the children are quite well behaved and are able to be kept busy until 10am. But the mom needs to make that effort and make sure that happens.

It's not unreasonable for a 7 and 9 year old to behave.", "I agree OP is NTA. But I do know that the kids are old enough to understand how to be quiet. Children at age 5 learn to be quiet in school, sometimes even younger. Quiet doesn't mean they have to be completely silent.", "Don't let her move in again. Ever. If she can't respect you, she can't live with you.", "I disagree. If you have two kids and are not financially stable enough to house them on your own, you are a bad parent. Yeah and the stipulations were agreed to by an adult who should have done her part to keep the kids quiet during the agreed upon times. If she wasn\u2019t able to do that then she shouldn\u2019t have agreed to those terms and found somewhere else to live.", "I feel like it depends on the child. Some children are quieter and more well behaved than others. Some other children can be quite energetic so it can be harder to have them not make noise. Probably both parenting and temperament of the child can contribute to it.\n\nFor example you will tell some children to not make noise, but then they would forget at times and make noise and you have to keep reminding them sometimes. Although maybe not at 9 years old.\n\nBut that's a good point about school. Maybe it's just my experience then lool", "My point is that OP put herself in this situation, and that you really can't expect perfect behavior with children.

Stupid me, thinking she'd finally be an adult.", "So parents who had some bad luck and subsequently lose their housing are by default bad parents? Because a lot of people are just one emergency away from falling below the poverty line. You can never have contingencies for everything that can happen unless you are so rich that none of that matters. Even people who planned ahead and have actual emergency funds can have the bad luck to run out of it before the tide turns and they can better themselves again. It does not make them bad parents. (not judging the specific case described here, just replying to the generalisation you made about what constitutes a bad parent).", "I agree, it obviously varies from child to child. My middle son is perfectly content to sit quietly and entertain himself while my youngest is a bouncing ball of energy. The children's mother should be responsible for making sure her children keep the noise at a reasonable level since it was agreed upon before they moved in. Take them outside to play if the weather's nice, turn on the TV in another part of the house at a reasonable volume, or do a craft project. Something. It sounds to me like the mom just didn't want to put in the effort, sadly.", "No. Parents just don\u2019t want to parent. My dad had overnight shift work some weeks and me and my siblings were quiet until we left or we played quietly in our rooms. I had empathy for my father and really wanted him to get some good sleep.

I guess part of it also depends on how light of a sleeper OP is. I could sleep through a tornado, but other people wake up at the slightest sound. So maybe my definition of \"quiet\" would be different than others.", "In what world should someone who is \u201cone emergency away from homelessness or poverty\u201d be in charge of taking care of children?

This happens with every kid who has a parent who works second shift. The kids might need reminders until the new habit is formed, but that just means their mom needs to be a parent and correct the behavior, lower the decibel level, and don't let them hang out outside of OP's door while she sleeps.

It wasn't complete silence just no excessive noise", "Oh no. Hard disagree. Kids can get ready and make a bit of noise that should not be disturbing someone behind a closed door.

Yes. Can it be done? Also yes.", "Yeah, saying \"please keep the noise down in the mornings\" is reasonable, but expecting no noise whatsoever is not.

Start a \"post-high school\" fund for your nibblings. If you are in the US, look into an UGMA/UTMA or a trust. Non-US countries have similar savings for kids to UGMA/UTMA accounts. A simple trust isn't that difficult to set up. Just make sure you have a back-up custodian or trustee that is not someone your sister can't manipulate. Never tell anyone about the money until the kids are of age. Even if it only amounts to a couple thousand each, it will give them a little breathing room when they come of age.
