And if she is telling Ruth those private little things, including details of intimacy up to, but not limited to, size then it stands to reason she will tell Ruth about the trauma and emotions of this novel and it will be a joke that strikes bone. \n\nTrust is earned and your wife is certainly not doing her part to earn it.", "NTA\n\nAnd I know it might seem that Ruth is the biggest AH but she isn't - it's your wife.", "NTA and I would also refuse to go to any more gatherings where Ruth is present. Be ruthless about this.", "NTA.\n\ntrust - so hard to come by but oh, how easily lost...", "NTA. This is not about the novel. This is about your wife\u2019s inability to keep private matters between you to herself. I do believe that you need to sit down with your wife and tell her that you love her but she repeatedly hurt you by betraying your trust to her so called friend. Let her know that since she refuses to protect the sanctity of the privacy in your marriage you will do it for her by no longer sharing information with her. \n\nOP, if I were you I would change the passwords on your computer or set up a secondary password to keep your wife from accessing your account and novel. The next time Ruth makes a disparaging remark at your expense tell her that your wife shared with you that she was born an asshole but the doctors couldn\u2019t find a way to remove her head from her ass in order to fix it. See how much she likes that.", "Looks like both your wife and her friend have big mouths. Listen a solid marriage is built on trust. If you cant trust your wife with secrets then you start to lose intimacy, which is the road to divorce. Get some marriage counseling and talk about your wifes need to gossip about you.", "NTA. Your novel is a deeply personal project based on sensitive experiences. While you initially promised to share it with your wife, her consistent oversharing with a person you're uncomfortable with justifies your change of mind.", "INFO\n\nSo I'm gonna ask the stupid question.....what's going to happen when you publish it?", "NTA. you don't need to let anyone read a rough draft except a professional editor who will care about the book, rather than using the content to gossip and mock the author.", "NTA. Your wife is an insensitive blabbermouth. That size thing is a straight up betrayal. Even if Ruth wasn\u2019t in the picture making things worse, I still wouldn\u2019t show wife the novel.", "NTA - You have the right to keep this private until you're at a point when you're comfortable having other people read your work. First drafts are always cringe and meant for your eyes only. And if your wife can't keep herself from blabbing yours and everyone else's business to her gossipy friend, then why open yourself up to more of that? \n\nNow, I am one to tell my bestie \"everything\" but there are definitely limits to this! Private conversations between you and your partner should stay between you and your partner, not you two plus Ruth over there, especially if she's going to make fun of you for it. Frankly, I'm surprised your wife didn't get angry at Ruth for that kind of behavior, but who am I? NTA", "Ok, I want to say something that isn\u2019t said enough. Yes size matters but only as far as compatibility. You could be too big for one person and not big enough for another. You just have to find the right partner. You clearly have not done that yet. If you\u2019re the joke in your friend group, I hate to tell you but they\u2019re not your friends.

I think of a work in progress or out on submission as what I call a \u201c naked manuscript.\u201d It\u2014and I\u2014are exposed and vulnerable.\n\nIt sounds as if you feel much the same way. Your wife put herself outside a circle of trust. That\u2019s not breaking a promise, not to let her see it. She put herself outside the people who can be trusted regardless of \u201cyou promised,\u201d scolds, guilts, or cutes.

It's actually best not to share what you are writing too soon with anyone but someone who is proofreading for  you, or people in a writing group who look at each other's writing and know how to talk about it thoughtfully and are agreed not to take it outside the group. It does not sound like you can trust your wife with your writing at  all\u2014pretty creepy of her to tell this jerk friend of hers ANYTHING about you when she knows you don't like her, knows she makes fun of you.

Intimate details about your relationship and personal endeavors related to trauma should never be shared with anyone else.", "YTA. Have you told your wife that you don't appreciate her sharing these intimate details? Has there been any conversation about your book being a secret?

There's no info on if she shared even basic info like \"It's about a sensitive subject/his dad\" Wife did nothing wrong and gets yelled at, as well as a \\*permanent\\* consequence?

There are better and clearer ways to get your point across. But your decision to stop sharing what's very personal to you with your wife -- and by extension, her nasty friend -- is totally on the money. Getting to read someone's unpublished work is a freaking privilege, given only to people who will support the author. Wife has abused the privilege. She's cut off.", "NTA.

Despite the longevity of her friendship with Ruth, there is still a need for a boundary where friendship ends and married life begins.\n\nYou have every right to safeguard your novel and its contents from your wife.

You must have skipped over the part where the wife is blabbing to her friend's about *the size of her husband's dick* and others and as a result being mocked for it. This is about a wife that doesn't know not to talk about these things to others and seemingly not caring to change. Good luck, OP, NTA.", "This. I share things my friends tell me with my partner (unless they ask me not to) but there's plenty of things between my partner and I that I have never shared with anyone, nor will I.

Your wife will see it at that point, her friends will hear about it and maybe see it, and the whole rest of the world will have access to it.", "You have a wife problem. You should sort it out. And cut Ruth off. NTA", "NTA But. There are three issues here.\n\n1) Your wife is appalling. She should not be sharing private information with Ruth. This is horrible behaviour and I'm not sure why you put up with it.\n\n2) Ruth is really awful. Why does your wife like her? Does she *enjoy* seeing you humiliated? Really think hard about that. When Ruth makes one of these cracks, does your wife laugh?\n\n3) Letting your wife read your novel - it's not necessary, and it's 100% your choice, but if you plan to publish, all kinds of people will be reading it (including possibly Ruth), and you might want to think about that and how you might handle it (eg using a pen name and keeping your identity secret, having some therapy to get you ready for interviews which will inevitably ask difficult questions, etc).\n\nBut also...I'm a writer, and I can't imagine not wanting my husband to read my work. He is always my first reader, and I value his input so much, and he is always so supportive.

I suspect that talking about your sex life with your partner to friends in great detail isn\u2019t considered an issue by women because most men don\u2019t do it, and I can\u2019t believe that many woman would be comfortable meeting a group of her partner\u2019s male friends if she found out that he had been discussing the size, shape, colour, and smell of her labia, for example, and if one of those friends made a reference to it she would lose her mind. Just writing that scenario sounds totally inconceivable yet that is basically what OP experienced.", "Your wife cannot be trusted. That\u2019s not a marriage.
