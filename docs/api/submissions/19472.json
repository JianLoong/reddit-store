She\u2019s struggled with food all her life, so me saying I\u2019m doing it solely because I don\u2019t like the way my body looks is difficult for her.

I stood my ground and said I won\u2019t keep the calorie scale where she can see it or use it in front of her, but the home workouts and smaller portion sizes are here to stay. She\u2019s been avoiding me since then, but sent me a message saying she\u2019s now trying to find a way to prioritise her mental health while living with me and while she understands she\u2019s just a roommate to me she hopes that I\u2019m a more empathetic, less shitty human being to my actual friends. \n\nThe thing for me is, I don\u2019t think that me losing weight is anybody\u2019s business but mine so this entire situation is just out of whack to me.

She needs to meet you by halfway by accepting that she doesn't get to be the sole determinant of what others do in shared spaces.\n\nIf she can't meet you halfway, then she needs to seek other, private accommodations where she will have sole control over the situation.", "Absolutely NTA.\nHer issues are hers to deal with.", "NTA. Her insecurities are not your responsibility.", "NTA. You've already been more accommodating than most people would be. She's feeling bad because you're doing what she's finding difficult, but she needs to sort her head out. She could be taking inspiration from you, or doing it together to get herself on track.", "Nta \n\nYou are 100% correct. It doesn\u2019t matter why you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing, it doesn\u2019t share anything to anybody else. You\u2019ve offered reasonable accommodations for her, but it\u2019s not your job to manage her triggers or her insecurities or anything about her.", "NTA. There\u2019s a difference between compromise and asking for unreasonable requests, and your roommate is pushing the limit on unreasonable requests. You are not responsible for her reactions regarding her own issues just as she\u2019s not responsible for you deciding to get a bit healthier in a way you choose. I feel she needs to seek help if it\u2019s triggering her that much. Her struggle is not your concern at this point. \n\nJust a friendly reminder: you live there, too, and what you decide to do in your own home (while respecting whatever decisions you agreed to within your lease) are none of her business.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to buy a ticket to her bullshit show. Not your monkeys, not your circus.\n\nIf she presses it, tell her watching her eat less intentionally triggers you, but you\u2019re not demanding she change because you wouldn\u2019t have any right. Same goes for her.", "NTA. You do you.", "NTA. She's certainly feeling judged and inadequate by being careless about your weight while she doesn't act on it.\n\nHave seen it in a couple.

Just because she's having feelings about it doesn't make it your responsibility. You're not doing anything offensive, so she should keep her feelings to herself. It's a part of growing up, learning that the world doesn't revolve around you and your feels. She should talk to someone about why someone else's exercise routine is affecting her so deeply. \n\nAgain, unless you're telling her she needs to partake, or suggesting she eat smaller portions too, or whatever. Then you would suck. But it doesn't sound like that's the case from your story here.", "NTA, I think you are not doing anything wrong.\n\nYou do not imply SHE should do anything about her weight/food, you are just doing your thing.

Hiding the scale is a nice compromise on your part. But you can\u2019t not work out or change your nutrition because it doesn\u2019t make her feel comfortable.

Not yours. This accommodation bullshit is getting out of hand.", "NTA. We are each responsible for our own health.

Who does she think she is? You are showing discipline and self control, which are great traits to have and judging by the sound of it room mate has neither. As far as compromise goes you don't need to have any when it comes to your own body and health, and if anything being around people who are trying to become healthy would help more when following a diet. If you give people like this any kind of control where does it lead to? What happens if you start a better paying job than her? Do you have to watch what you spend money on incase she can't afford the same things? What if you get a boyfriend if she's single? Is he allowed over? Just hypotheticals but similar idea. People these days seem to be far too comfortable trying to dictate what others are doing.\n\nNTA btw", ">while she understands she\u2019s just a roommate to me she hopes that I\u2019m a more empathetic, less shitty human being to my actual friends.\n\n? Do exactly as I say or you have no empathy. NTA.", "You want to lose weight, because you want to be slimmer. You think you will look better slimmer. You want the \"bikini body\".\n\nThat's your choice. It's a perfectly reasonable thing to want to lose a bit of weight to feel more attractive. As long as it doesn't become an eating disorder (and it doesn't sound like you're in any danger of that), then you're free to eat as much, or as little, as you prefer, and to exercise or not as you wish.\n\nI sympathize with your roommate and her insecurity about her body, but she's being an unreasonable asshole. What does she want - she wants you to eat larger portions, so she can feel better about the amount of food she eats? That's a really unhealthy attitude. The amount you eat has nothing to do with her, and she doesn't need to be comparing what she eats to what you eat.\n\nDoing workouts in the living room?  That does rather hog the living space, so I hope and assume that you're being courteous about the times you choose to do your workouts, so you're not excluding her from the shared space. Assuming that you're doing that (so what she's complaining about is your yoga mat or stair step in the corner of the room, rather than your lycra-clad behind jiggling in front of her all the time), then she's being unreasonable again.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
