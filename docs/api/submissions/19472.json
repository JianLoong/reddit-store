If you give people like this any kind of control where does it lead to? What happens if you start a better paying job than her? Do you have to watch what you spend money on incase she can't afford the same things? What if you get a boyfriend if she's single? Is he allowed over? Just hypotheticals but similar idea.

You want the \"bikini body\".\n\nThat's your choice. It's a perfectly reasonable thing to want to lose a bit of weight to feel more attractive. As long as it doesn't become an eating disorder (and it doesn't sound like you're in any danger of that), then you're free to eat as much, or as little, as you prefer, and to exercise or not as you wish.\n\nI sympathize with your roommate and her insecurity about her body, but she's being an unreasonable asshole. What does she want - she wants you to eat larger portions, so she can feel better about the amount of food she eats? That's a really unhealthy attitude. The amount you eat has nothing to do with her, and she doesn't need to be comparing what she eats to what you eat.\n\nDoing workouts in the living room?  That does rather hog the living space, so I hope and assume that you're being courteous about the times you choose to do your workouts, so you're not excluding her from the shared space. Assuming that you're doing that (so what she's complaining about is your yoga mat or stair step in the corner of the room, rather than your lycra-clad behind jiggling in front of her all the time), then she's being unreasonable again.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
