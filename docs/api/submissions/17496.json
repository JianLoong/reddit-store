I was a bit confused and she explained that she heard my sister talking about putting her in a nursing home and she wanted me to take care of my mom by buying her a house and providing for  her. My mom is 59 and has some meatle heath problems that have gotten worse with age but well manage with meds. I still pay the taxes and have the house in my name. \n\nThe issue at hand: I just moved in with my mom after getting a divorce, I took over all the bills and pay for all the groceries. I set my mom down and told her I take one night a week off , were I by all means fall off the face of the universe to unwind and  get ready for my weekend, I work two jobs. I let her know it Thrusday that I like to take off. I leave work around 530 pm and I'll be home at 630 am to get the kids ready . She agreed to this. I also let her know my ex had agreed as well to keep up my night off, so if something happened to reach 0ut to him first. This excludes if someone gets sick hurt or has to go to the hospital. \n\nWell Thrusday is coming up and my mom started asking what my plans are, I told her I don't know yet. She kept pushing so I ask if I needed to not go out, she said no,but she wanted to know place,time , and people I would be with. My mind blanked and I said I'm not 13 years old mom. I don't have to tell you any of that just let you know im safe. \nShe came at me with it's my house my rules, I didn't mean to say hatefully but it came out wrong \"Actually it's my house if you want to get technical\", she got mad at me and truly started to treat me like a child yelling and telling me I'm ungrateful for her helping me out. \n\nI told her on that day I enjoy my privacy, that even once my ex and I were together he didn't know where I was and only know I was safe. She said I'm an ass \"hat\" and that's why me and him are not together. That I was disrespectful to their feeling about my safety.\n\nEdit: My mom has bipolar, she is perfectly capable to watch the kids for a  night. My sister's have been waiting to put her in a nursing home for as long as I can remember because she is not a great house keeper or good with money and it would be easier on their lifes. My mom also know all my partners by name and havw their phone numbers. She is the one who told me I was poly, so those accusing me of sneaking off please don't .

NTA.", "NTA", "So two years ago my friend\u2019s step son had his cell phone on him, but he didn\u2019t say were he was. He was murdered and I worked at the hospital he was sent to. No one knew who this boy was and his locked phone didn\u2019t have an IOC. He died alone at 15 surrounded by strangers. This is one of many reasons you let people know where you are, there are dead zones, battery issues and a myriad of different reasons that as a parent you don\u2019t get anytime to \u201cgo dark\u201d because you have a cell phone.", "YTA. It must be nice to leave ur kids a whole night with someone else. Why do ppl even have kids if they like their own space \ud83d\ude44", "INFO \n\nIf someone gets hurt do you want to ce contacted right after she contacts the ex?", "NTA for saying that but you can demand someone watches your kids every week for.you to disappear. Kids need to go to dads that night if that is how.you both agree to behaving.", "You are NTA for saying it's your house. That's an objective fact.     \nThe rest is debatable. Your mom sounds difficult, and your life sounds difficult, but you're still responsible for your kids, and your mom isn't required to watch them for you.     \nYour mom is definitely an asshole. You and your ex, I'm not sure if your assholes. I would need to know more.", "YTA but only because the house is only yours because your mum is unwell, grandma clearly seen it as her daughters and wanted her to stay in it. \n\nYou deserve your freedom and privacy but wrong thing to throw in your mums face", "I can\u2019t imagine not knowing where my wife is one night a week, every week. No wonder it didn\u2019t work out. That\u2019s insane.", "Bipolar disorder. Her mom has spending issues/managing money issues. It doesn't mean she can't watch children, it just means she has poor spending habits.", "Congratulations! I'm a new mom this year too!", "Folks with bipolar disorder  ( and it's well managed) can be baby sitters just fine.\n\n\nDon't act like it completely disbarrs someone from watching a couple kids once a week.", "Yeah, bizarre. She just takes off and leaves her kids with her bipolar mom and doesn\u2019t tell anyone where she\u2019s at? Wut? \n\nThe only reason she has a house is under the stipulation she takes care of her mom, which is more than paying bills and groceries. It\u2019s doubtful her grandma (who is the one actually paying for her mom\u2019s care) wanted this arrangement. \n\nYTA. Oh, and grow up. You\u2019re 32, not 19.", "Sitters require payment, and 12 hours overnight? She\u2019s looking at a $200/weekly expense. Her mom is saving her a lot of money.", "Also YTA", "It's easier to write a will than set up a trust fund.", "And the got the money to BUY MOM a house. So there's that.", "Is it really? This comment was, though.", "Yeah, it's sus as hell.", "Right? What she goes somewhere else? Does she wake up mom to update locations or just make sure her phone is charged?", "I hear what you are saying, but in many many places in this world, including relatively affluent places like the US and western Europe, a single woman can go missing and not be found alarmingly quickly. And not just for worst case scenarios like kidnapping or murder. Especially if she is dating, having a lifeline of someone knowing where you are and checking in at preset times is a great comfort. A text at 10am and 12am with a simple pre-arranged text and response is a great safety precaution. Especially if she is going back to his place or a hotel.\n\nI know plenty of people who had a bit much and wandered a bit from the bar and weren't able to be helpful as to where they were. When I was in college years ago, we hoped for the best with payphones and waiting. With smart phones and location tracking, this specific issue can be solved passively.\n\nThough not always. Drinking doesn't even have to be a factor. One of my friends was out gift shopping across town, was hit by a car, and his phone was launched from his hand and never found. His girlfriend found him as a John Doe at a hospital by going to the shop and asking around when he didn't show up that night, they saw the accident and she called emergency dispatch and found the hospital.\n\nA simple \"I'll be at THIS bar tonight\" can help both friends and police get to her in the case of over drinking or sudden injury, as if she doesn't show up someone can quickly piece together a timeline. It costs her nothing and grants her and her kids a safety line.", "How do you get a hold of them if you don\u2019t know where they are? People who do that also silence their phones, mind you. The point is they don\u2019t want to be found.\n\nHer mom is right, there\u2019s no way that didn\u2019t have an impact on ex marriage.\n\nGiven OPs other posts on poly subs, it\u2019s worth saying, if your spouse doesn\u2019t know where you are, you\u2019re not Polyamorous, **you\u2019re CHEATING**", "No, that\u2019s a way to reach her. Assuming she answers the phone. Which if she comes into danger then she probably won\u2019t answer soooo\u2026", "I've been poly for ten years, and this is *not* how it's done. When I'm going out for a date night, my partner and kid both know what I'm doing and who I'm with, and that they can contact me for anything.\n\nThis person is being very shady.", "You should know what I mean. What does her being reachable by phone mean if she's already kidnapped in the back of a car or in an alley? The potential kidnappers/assailants likely aren't answering her phone for her.\n\nETA: I know what I'm saying is extreme, but hey \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f anything could happen. I'm not about to have my body not found under any circumstance, whether I need a break or not.", "Yeah but once you have kids you have a responsibility to them to not disappear", "1. You were entrusted to provide a home for your mom, it\u2019s just as much her home as it is yours. \n2. She gave you a boundary and you should give it respect because she doesn\u2019t owe you free child care. \n3. Leave the kids with dad if he is ok with it-or would that affect how much you get in child support.\n4. Pay a babysitter who wouldn\u2019t have the same rules but be warned that\u2019s a $200/weekly habit to have to not respect a boundary.", "The amount of financial abuse from FAMILY is pretty abhorrent too.", "I get you\u2019re an adult and entitled to privacy but I\u2019d rather at least one person know where I\u2019m going and who with so if things go sideways they\u2019d know where to start looking for me. I mean phones die, cars break and lots of psychos running around these days\u2026.", "Yeah, if she is having one night stands then at least someone should know where she is. I hope if she is spending the night at random places she at least tells a friend.", "Right?", "I'm gonna guess mom knows exactly what's up and it probably figured heavily into why OP is divorced.", "I think the mom is capable of living alone OPs grandma just left the house to them so they could take care of mom when they can no longer live alone OP only lives with their mom now because of the divorce", "Just because OP's mother doesn't know where she is does not mean she cannot reach her by phone. Also, the mother was instructed to reach out to the ex first  That's more than adequate coverage.", "Then he's also too far to be an emergency contact. If something terrible is happening, you need to be able to get to your kids RIGHT THEN, not in an hour or two", "Fwiw, OP said mom is bipolar, manages it well, but has spending/money management issues, which tracks with BPD, and is why the house was left to OP.   Perhaps with some stipulation for guaranteed residency for mom.    If that were the case, it would be her mom's place in spirit, while technically being under ownership of OP.\n\nBased on the way I read it, OP was not residing with her mom at the time when she took ownership of the house upon grandma's death.  She moved into her mom's place after her divorce.\n\nI'm gonna go with Y t a for the \"akkschually, this is my house\" remark.  OP moved in with her mom for a cheap place to live after her divorce.  She does have to adhere to mom's \"my house, my rules\" to a certain extent.  Though that's highly subjectuv.", "If op owns the house, which she does. She even pays the taxes and all of the bills.\n\nIt's op's house. Not the mother's.", "Irs one night a week. Calm the fuck down.", "How could mom help if OP died?  Resurrect her?  NTA", "I didn't even had to tell my parents where I'm going since the age of 18. Even after the age of 16 all I had to do is to announce and not asking for permission as long as it was within the country (not USA), I paid for it and it wasn't using drugs while getting pregnant at a caravan park.\nIf she is available in case of emergencies her mom has nothing to do with where OP is and it's unacceptable to say to an adult that 'It' s my house my rules'. Yes she is looking for OP's children 1 night a week. And OP is lookinf for her 6 day and nights a week while working at two jobs and ia willing to do it for a lot of years as long as her mother needs help.\nOP's mom can ask where she's going but OP is not obligated to answer and her mother demanding it was out of line especially the way she did.", "Then they invented cell phones.", "\u201cProfessional sitter?\u201d That\u2019s what people who aren\u2019t reminiscing about their childhood call a \u201cNanny\u201d auntie Em, try again.", "One night every week or did you forget that detail?", "By being prepared for the kids, since the kids will not only need to know their mom died, but also figure out whether custody goes to the ex or to the mom.", "Yeah I think its ok to not tell someone where you are at unless they ask but it seems a bit odd to be so vehement about not telling someone where you are going especially if they are expected to look after children. If they are not going to stalk you or pose a hazard to you giving a general idea worst case means they can in theory contact you in case of emergency if say your phone is flat.\n\nI dunno, feels like they are setting a boundary with their mother and I think its the wrong one to set. But sure I can see some scenarios where it might be overbearing if they are bothered by this sort of thing.", "Doesn't change that op works 2 jobs, pays all the bills and owns the house.\n\nShe deserves her one night a week off.\n\nYes, weekly.", "No, I didn't forget? She works 2 jobs. Takes care of her kids. One night a week is well deserved. Shes not unreachable, she just doesnt disclose her location. You know why? SINGLE MOM, 2 JOBS!!

Where's the dad, is the question you should be asking.", "The kids aren\u2019t going to her mom.", "What does that have to do with where she dies? Jesus.", "You seem to be forgetting that the mother was instructed to reach out to OP's ex first.", "One night off a week sure not go off radar for a night. I realize most people on Reddit are either young or don\u2019t have kids but she doesn\u2019t get to drop off earth every week. And she sure as hell shouldn\u2019t be leaving her children with her mother who cannot live by herself. It is asinine everyone is ignoring so many details to just go she deserves a night off lol."]}
