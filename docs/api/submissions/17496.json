I was a bit confused and she explained that she heard my sister talking about putting her in a nursing home and she wanted me to take care of my mom by buying her a house and providing for  her. My mom is 59 and has some meatle heath problems that have gotten worse with age but well manage with meds. I still pay the taxes and have the house in my name. \n\nThe issue at hand: I just moved in with my mom after getting a divorce, I took over all the bills and pay for all the groceries. I set my mom down and told her I take one night a week off , were I by all means fall off the face of the universe to unwind and  get ready for my weekend, I work two jobs. I let her know it Thrusday that I like to take off. I leave work around 530 pm and I'll be home at 630 am to get the kids ready . She agreed to this. I also let her know my ex had agreed as well to keep up my night off, so if something happened to reach 0ut to him first. This excludes if someone gets sick hurt or has to go to the hospital. \n\nWell Thrusday is coming up and my mom started asking what my plans are, I told her I don't know yet. She kept pushing so I ask if I needed to not go out, she said no,but she wanted to know place,time , and people I would be with. My mind blanked and I said I'm not 13 years old mom. I don't have to tell you any of that just let you know im safe. \nShe came at me with it's my house my rules, I didn't mean to say hatefully but it came out wrong \"Actually it's my house if you want to get technical\", she got mad at me and truly started to treat me like a child yelling and telling me I'm ungrateful for her helping me out. \n\nI told her on that day I enjoy my privacy, that even once my ex and I were together he didn't know where I was and only know I was safe. She said I'm an ass \"hat\" and that's why me and him are not together. That I was disrespectful to their feeling about my safety.\n\nEdit: My mom has bipolar, she is perfectly capable to watch the kids for a  night. My sister's have been waiting to put her in a nursing home for as long as I can remember because she is not a great house keeper or good with money and it would be easier on their lifes. My mom also know all my partners by name and havw their phone numbers. She is the one who told me I was poly, so those accusing me of sneaking off please don't .
