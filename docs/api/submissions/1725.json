Usually it's like a good bottle of wine/booze or a gift certificate for a restaurant.  But it can be cash.  We keep it on the downlow and it works. We do IT services for financial companies. So Thanksgiving weekend is sort of important.  \n\nSo one of my coworkers does not like to pay to trade shifts but has before.  They always complain about how it's not fair that people like me who are unmarried and have no kids get holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas off.  \n\nSorry ma'am but even though I don't have kids I am one. Maybe my parents want to see me too?  So anyways my parents are actually going to Bermuda this Thanksgiving because that's where my sister is and she just had a baby.  I would love to go but I don't have enough vacation time to make it worthwhile.  Instead I have plans with friend. They aren't super important to me. We are just going to eat turkey and watch all the Thanksgiving episodes of Friends. \n\nI mentioned this to another coworker and the other one overheard.  It is her turn to be in the office and on call for the holiday. She couldn't find anyone to cover her shift.  So she basically begged me to cover for her.  I liked my plans so I said no.  She finally offered me money. Well if the Simpsons has taught me anything it's that \"Money can be exchanged for goods and services\". So we haggled and then agreed. She would take my New Year's Eve shift and give me a couple of hundred dollars to cover her from Thursday to Sunday.  Win win I thought. \n\nTwo days later my boss came over and asked me if I wanted to change the schedule as I had agreed. I asked why he was getting involved as we usually just handled it amongst ourselves.  He said that he had gotten a complaint that I extorted money out of a coworker for covering their shift.  He said that while it wasn't against company policy it was frowned upon.  I said that I understood and that no money had changed hands and that no I didn't want to change shifts.  \n\nMy boss was promoted from the ranks so he knew the score. He knows how we trade shifts. So he was cool.  My coworker, not so much.  She started bugging me, saying that she had already told her parents that her family would be coming. And that I was being an asshole for not covering like I said I would.  \n\nI told her that someone has gone to the boss and tattled on our deal so I could not follow through since I could get in trouble.  She said that I could do it for free.  I declined.  She said she would pay me more than we agreed on.  I said no thanks I don't want any trouble.  \n\nSo now she is acting all pissy because I won't work for her and now she is being shut out of the regular shift trading because everyone knows she tried to use the boss to screw me over.  \n\nShe says that I'm an asshole for not following through.

Aaaaaggh.", "Okay yeah no totally true", "NTA. Sometimes you have to work holidays.  It sucks.  Since she went and snitched she lost what little bargaining power she had.

I get you don't like your coworker, it was not smart on your coworker's part to make a deal w/you and then complain, so you're definitely not T A for going back on the deal.

Maybe not, but I think it's an A H move.", "NTA for the reasons the other said.\n\nBut can we talk about the fact that she expects people without their own family to cover holidays?

In my work once you take a shift. It's yours and if you don't show up that's treated as an absence as if it was your own shift.

We are scheduling the first week of Feb now) it's either let's see what your grandparents can do, or I'll try to swap but can't make promises. I'll explain why I want to swap but guilt never comes up (oh you don't have a kid you wouldn't get it). There have been plenty of issues because I couldn't get something off. \n\nAs for holidays, I've worked hard to make sure I'm off Thanksgiving (our big holiday) and work Christmas.

Noone will ever switch with that person again if they cant reciprocate a switch for the other individual.", "I totally agree. There are just some jobs that holidays are just another day. My husband is a tow operator and he has worked or been on call every single holiday since we stated dating. It does suck some times but we are able to make our own little traditions with our children. Also sometimes it's a good excuse to not have to deal with some family members. Also I worked in retail for years and worked every single holiday (prior to kids) as well...it just is what it is \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.

I didn't even know her well, we hadn't spoken about me covering her work(in fact i couldn't coz we were different teams anyway, but the department had rules as to how many could take vacation at the same time and i had mine booked well in advance).\n\nI get pulled into a room by, not my team lead, not my manager, but my managers manager and this woman to swap holidays. He started with \"right, whats this all about you wont swap\". And I had no idea, so I asked, and when it was stated i wouldn't swap holidays i asked again, coz it still wasnt clear what the issue was since i hadnt even been approached in the first place to refuse, who this woman was or why i was there aside from having booked 7 months in advance.\n\nThen he states \"you dont have kids, whats the problem swapping\". So i stopped him there with \"now hang on a minute Paul, YOU dont know ME, WE'VE never actually spoken before. You dont know my family situation, neither does my manager or team lead coz I have a rule never to speak about family in work, ever, so YOU cant tell ME \"You dont have kids\", its true I don't adorn my cubicle with photos and on mondays i dont talk about everything we did for the weekend together, i arrive on time for work, i never leave early, i dont take time off at school term breaks for holidays\". I side eyed the woman next to me, she looked away. \n\nHe had tried to interrupt me several times and then Silence followed. We sat there staring at eachother for at least a minute and a half til he eventually said \"i need to sort this out\" in an irate tone. 10 more seconds of silence and he kicks me out of his office to go back to my desk.\n\nI went by HR instead as it was on the way, just in time for his phone call to come in as im standing there for him to ask over the phone if I have kids or not on my employee profile. To which I gladly shout at the girl holding the phone \"Paul, the company files on me wont have that information either, aside from the fact you are not entitled to ask those questions or access the information as you are not a data controller for it, the company health insurance is crap compared to my partner's plan which they would be listed under, my death in service and pension lists my partner as the beneficiary and there is no mandatory rule that employees must register their children with their employers\". He hung up. \n\nI felt bad for the HR women, but she was mid-tier HR and well capable. I explained in 2 mins flat the conversation I had just had prior to the phone call and asked if I needed a record with them. Went back to my desk. \n\nMy manager came by my desk then! In what i can only assume to be a case of bad timing and asked how I was, is it busy this time of year, always finishing things up for the holidays...yup...hes going there....\"do you have any plans for Christmas\". Normally you continue working, talk to someone beside you, but at this I stopped, turned and looked up at him in disbelief and said \"jesus christ i feel like quitting\" just as the HR woman walked up toy desk behind me. \n\nShed come to follow up and say there was no issue, everything was fine. Til she just arrived at it all over again. Manager tried to walk swiftly away like we'd finished a conversation about work. Now i had to recount THIS conversation at my desk in the office surrounded by coworkers about how i felt intimidated by all levels of management and my privacy violated and how I thought HR was there to fire me when she came to my desk. \n\nNow it was a real fire! Coz at least in my country(good ol EU laws) \"hostile workplace\" and \"constructive dismissal\" can be serious cases. HR woman took the initiative and pulled manager into a useless glass walled meeting room everyone could see and hear and he got strips torn off him. \n\nShe told me everything was ok, there was no issues. I was actually happy, but stunned at this point, so i asked if she was sure just coz the situation was mad itself. She left an 5 mins later im getting calls from my managers manager on my phone, i don't pick up but he rings someone else who tells me to go down, HR is in his office too. I go down and i get an apology for the whole mess, never should have spoken to me, really sorry etc..etc..\n\nI was offered a few extra days off, a company gift card, was there anything in town I wanted to take the family to the company would organise it etc..etc..\n\nIm still stunned, complete shock face, i literally don't know what to say in response to how the whole afternoon has gone so im quiet til i say \"i need to go back to my desk and its nearly home time\". \n\nI took none of the essential payoffs over the next day when HR followed up with me, said my private life was my own, company sponsored trips or special treatment didn't sit well with me. \n\nI cant tell you how much clearance and leeway they all gave me after that, i had a year of essential bliss in my office where noone ever followed up with me for anything, meetings with team lead(who was never involved) went from kpi/stats and tickets/stuff resolved to \"how are you, great to see you, the work is ok...thats all i have, we'll do this again in a month or two\" \n\nAs a side note, coz i never confirmed it, i speak in broad terms about family not specific persons like children. I do not have kids. But i do allow others to interpret things how they will, their assumptions are their own. I also use things like hypotheticals \"if i spend my time with my family...\" Which is not a confirmation that that is what im doing or intend to do.", "This is exactly what I was thinking, but everyone here is going after the coworker on assumption.
