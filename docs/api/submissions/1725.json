Usually it's like a good bottle of wine/booze or a gift certificate for a restaurant.  But it can be cash.  We keep it on the downlow and it works. We do IT services for financial companies. So Thanksgiving weekend is sort of important.  \n\nSo one of my coworkers does not like to pay to trade shifts but has before.  They always complain about how it's not fair that people like me who are unmarried and have no kids get holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas off.  \n\nSorry ma'am but even though I don't have kids I am one. Maybe my parents want to see me too?  So anyways my parents are actually going to Bermuda this Thanksgiving because that's where my sister is and she just had a baby.  I would love to go but I don't have enough vacation time to make it worthwhile.  Instead I have plans with friend. They aren't super important to me. We are just going to eat turkey and watch all the Thanksgiving episodes of Friends. \n\nI mentioned this to another coworker and the other one overheard.  It is her turn to be in the office and on call for the holiday. She couldn't find anyone to cover her shift.  So she basically begged me to cover for her.  I liked my plans so I said no.  She finally offered me money. Well if the Simpsons has taught me anything it's that \"Money can be exchanged for goods and services\". So we haggled and then agreed. She would take my New Year's Eve shift and give me a couple of hundred dollars to cover her from Thursday to Sunday.  Win win I thought. \n\nTwo days later my boss came over and asked me if I wanted to change the schedule as I had agreed. I asked why he was getting involved as we usually just handled it amongst ourselves.  He said that he had gotten a complaint that I extorted money out of a coworker for covering their shift.  He said that while it wasn't against company policy it was frowned upon.  I said that I understood and that no money had changed hands and that no I didn't want to change shifts.  \n\nMy boss was promoted from the ranks so he knew the score. He knows how we trade shifts. So he was cool.  My coworker, not so much.  She started bugging me, saying that she had already told her parents that her family would be coming. And that I was being an asshole for not covering like I said I would.  \n\nI told her that someone has gone to the boss and tattled on our deal so I could not follow through since I could get in trouble.  She said that I could do it for free.  I declined.  She said she would pay me more than we agreed on.  I said no thanks I don't want any trouble.  \n\nSo now she is acting all pissy because I won't work for her and now she is being shut out of the regular shift trading because everyone knows she tried to use the boss to screw me over.  \n\nShe says that I'm an asshole for not following through.
