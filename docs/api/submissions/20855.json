She knew the date and what she was doing or didn't listen to you AT ALL. Either way, that is on her.\n\nI say you need to do two things from here\n\n1. Get ahead of this with mutual friends. I say this because so often people will do things like this and then ride is for more attention, sympathy, etc. I'm not saying call her out in public or on sm, but saying anyone you both  know to find a way to bring it up. Or even better just announce publicly how excited you are about the Festival Job and put the date. GUSH about how great it is, what it does for your career, and how long you've known about it.\n\n2.

The wedding is not about you, and she likely was balancing a bunch of competing considerations around the date.", "NTA. You gave her your availability and she ignored it. Don\u2019t feel guilty. I would NEVER do that to my best friend. I would plan my wedding making SURE she could be there. And then to make you feel guilty about your job? NO. That is not how a friend acts. \n\nFrankly I recommend you start thinking about your life ahead without her eventually.

Crying about them not being able to go despite being told well in advance about that being the one time they couldn't attend? Talk about bad acting. NTA.

Look at what you\u2019ve worked so hard for and accomplished!! I know it hurts what has transpired with your friend and her wedding - but you\u2019ve gotta keep standing up for you. This is so incredibly important- don\u2019t you let anything stand in your way! You did all you could reasonably do to be there for her wedding, the rest is hers to deal with as she will. I do not like her trying to guilt you about it. This has to be a hardline for you. Never light yourself on fire to keep anyone warm. You\u2019re NTA! And if the relationship matters to her, this guilt trip nonsense will be done with. Hopefully there\u2019s a chance to communicate and talk this through, and if not, the season has ended and it\u2019s ok to be grateful for what was. I\u2019m cheering you on!!!", "NTA- She picked today that you.

You should do what you want/need to do, but she needs to be ok with the fact that you won't be there.", "NTA op and maybe you should rescind the offer to do a photoshoot for the dressmaker. If your best friend cares so little about you that she'd schedule her wedding that day why are you going to provide labor to get her discounts for the day she snubbed you", "ESH don't guilt her over your own choice to attend and lose the contract or just decline the invite. Believe it or not there are usually a number of factors that couples need to decide on dates and your professional success shouldn't be one of them!\n\nYou'll need to come to a decision that doesn't offload all responsibility onto the marrying couple. Your hurt feelings aren't their responsibility!", "NTA. you warned her and this plays in to your income. if she\u2019s gonna pick the one day you can\u2019t come she has no right to complain.", "NAH\n\nYou definitely aren't doing anything wrong, you told your friend in advance and she chose the date knowing the consequences. You also have a legitimate reason - it's your livelihood at stake here.\n\nThat being said, your friend might have had other conflicts for the other days - who knows, maybe a family member with a similar problem. Try not to think of it as her purposefully picking one you couldn't go to, because there's likely more going on.", "NTA\n\nShe knew the date was taken for you.

Seems to be done on purpose, especially since she had other options.", "NTA \n\nHere\u2019s my take on it. You both have mutual respect and admiration for each other. She unfortunately screwed up in her planning. Being a bride comes with a lot of pressure and so many moving parts. I don\u2019t think she purposely forgot, it just got misplaced during her decision making. There\u2019s nothing either one of you can do to make both of you happy. You have to work with what you have and go with it. Plan a special day just the two of you. After the wedding/honeymoon have a girls night where she shares wedding memories and you share festival details.", "I'm wondering whether OP was supposed to be photographer at wedding and just didn't know yet.

That was\u2026shortsighted of her. \n\nHave fun at the festival!", "I agree, I've calmed down a bit and I know she didn't choose that date to hurt me, I just feel sad.", "She does however want my boyfriend to DJ the wedding which he was going to do for free but he now feels weird.", "OP didn't try to guilt the bride into changing the date, only bride tried to play the guilt card, not sure how OP sucks here.", "Good.  At least you know you will have some support if bride goes stupid.", "Definitely NTA  there a hundreds of caterers in the world, very few good friends.", "Sadness is 1000% justified. For both of you.", "But friend does need to take responsibility for her own sad feelings instead of trying to blame them on OP and guilt tripping OP for \"picking work over her wedding\". Because the friend \"picked\" wedding logistics over their friendship first.", "NTA. But this actually has nothing to do with you, and you need to realize that. It's her wedding, and she might not have a choice with dates due to the venue or what her fiance wanted. You dont know what it was. \n\nThe fact of the matter is, they were only thinking about what they wanted for their wedding which only has to do with them and only them. It had nothing to do with you. You can't take this personally. \n\nUnfortunately for her, you can't make her wedding. She might have forgotten the dates you couldn't go. But realistically, I'm picking the date that i want, not the one that works for just one individual. Wven if it's my best friend. That's the reality. \n\nHer wedding is not about you, so stop making it seem like it is. Your abandonment issue has nothing to do with her wedding day. You need to let it go. You're disappointed, but its out of your control.", "Way to go in the job.  Congratulations \n\nShe played a stupid game if it was a my friend will choose me over her career or choosing a caterer over you\n\nYour  friend is the AH  for been upset when she knew your priority was sent before she choose her date", "YTA. It\u2019s her wedding.", "NTA! You told her well in advance about your prior engagements. If her and her SO decided to move ahead with that same date that's on them not you. Unless she can pay you with consistent jobs every year like this festival you'd be dumb to pick her over it. It would be different if the festival hadn't set dates yet and she had and she had asked first. But that didn't happen", "Guilt is for when you do something that goes against your values. What you\u2019re feeling is not guilt. You are making a choice to honor yourself, passions, work. Breaking that would go against your values and integrity. \n\nHer booking on that day (if she had multiple options) is her wanting you to go against yourself to show how much you love her or she doesn\u2019t want you there. \n\nEither way, not a friend. \n\nSo proud of you for doing you - go have a great time at the festival and keep the friends who champion you!", "NTA\u2026 you have her a heads up, she chose it anyway.  That was her choice.  Wish her the best on the day of and tell her you can\u2019t wait to hear all about it.  No need to worry more about it.  If you are good friends you will survive missing the wedding and if she is that good of a friend you will eventually forgive her for picking the only date you couldn\u2019t attend.  If you guys don\u2019t move past it then the friendship wasn\u2019t as strong as you thought.", "NTA... A friend wouldn't ask you to blow your career in order to attend her wedding. It's not missing 'a day of work'. This is risking loosing your spot on a career altering oportunity. \n\nI'd not ask her to change her date, i'd just refocus. \"How can I help you get ready for your big day. I may not be able to share it with you, but we can have great memories getting you ready...\"\n\nIf somehow she doesn't accept this change in direction, well then it is all about her, and I'd step back from the close friend stage, and hope that some day in the future a two sided genuine friendship reamerges.", "NTA- you told her one weekend and she picked it", "Your career should not be undermined or jeopardized for the sake of one event, even if it\u2019s a wedding. You have worked hard to establish yourself in your field, and opportunities like Glastonbury are crucial for your growth and professional reputation. It\u2019s unfortunate that your friend doesn\u2019t fully grasp the significance of this.\n\nWhile it\u2019s understandable that she may be upset or disappointed, it\u2019s important for her to recognize the larger context and the sacrifices you\u2019ve made for your career. Ultimately, it\u2019s her decision to choose that date despite knowing the implications it had for you.

My best friend couldn't get leave from the Air Force to come to my wedding, and I was so bummed.

She could have chosen the date when you could be there with her, but she didn't.", "NTA, possibly none because there may be other reasons she chose the date. See if she mentions it and how she reacts that you cannot make it.", "NTA\n\nYou told her in advance that you couldn't go that day. Well in advance of her picking the day.\n\nOdds are you did yourself a favor.\n\nIn America the bridal party is picked way in advance,. It sounds like she didn't ask you to be a bridesmaid. She may have been expecting you to be her photographer.\n\nThe music industry may seem massive, but it's a small network of people.", "NTA at all, and I feel sad for you. That's really hurtful, and it's pretty manipulative of her to cry that you can't come when she willingly chose the ONE day you couldn't be there. I would tell her straight up that you are hurt she chose that day, and to stop acting as though that wasn't 100% her choice.", "NTA She picked it knowing you could not attend. She is telling you how she feels OR she chose the date as best fit for family members. Send her a card and enjoy your day at Glastonbury. Stop feeling guilty.
