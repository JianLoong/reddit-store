I say this because so often people will do things like this and then ride is for more attention, sympathy, etc. I'm not saying call her out in public or on sm, but saying anyone you both  know to find a way to bring it up. Or even better just announce publicly how excited you are about the Festival Job and put the date. GUSH about how great it is, what it does for your career, and how long you've known about it.\n\n2.

This is so incredibly important- don\u2019t you let anything stand in your way! You did all you could reasonably do to be there for her wedding, the rest is hers to deal with as she will. I do not like her trying to guilt you about it. This has to be a hardline for you. Never light yourself on fire to keep anyone warm. You\u2019re NTA!

Believe it or not there are usually a number of factors that couples need to decide on dates and your professional success shouldn't be one of them!\n\nYou'll need to come to a decision that doesn't offload all responsibility onto the marrying couple.

Seems to be done on purpose, especially since she had other options.", "NTA \n\nHere\u2019s my take on it. You both have mutual respect and admiration for each other. She unfortunately screwed up in her planning. Being a bride comes with a lot of pressure and so many moving parts. I don\u2019t think she purposely forgot, it just got misplaced during her decision making. There\u2019s nothing either one of you can do to make both of you happy. You have to work with what you have and go with it. Plan a special day just the two of you. After the wedding/honeymoon have a girls night where she shares wedding memories and you share festival details.", "I'm wondering whether OP was supposed to be photographer at wedding and just didn't know yet.

At least you know you will have some support if bride goes stupid.", "Definitely NTA  there a hundreds of caterers in the world, very few good friends.", "Sadness is 1000% justified. For both of you.", "But friend does need to take responsibility for her own sad feelings instead of trying to blame them on OP and guilt tripping OP for \"picking work over her wedding\". Because the friend \"picked\" wedding logistics over their friendship first.", "NTA. But this actually has nothing to do with you, and you need to realize that. It's her wedding, and she might not have a choice with dates due to the venue or what her fiance wanted. You dont know what it was. \n\nThe fact of the matter is, they were only thinking about what they wanted for their wedding which only has to do with them and only them. It had nothing to do with you. You can't take this personally. \n\nUnfortunately for her, you can't make her wedding. She might have forgotten the dates you couldn't go. But realistically, I'm picking the date that i want, not the one that works for just one individual. Wven if it's my best friend. That's the reality. \n\nHer wedding is not about you, so stop making it seem like it is. Your abandonment issue has nothing to do with her wedding day. You need to let it go. You're disappointed, but its out of your control.", "Way to go in the job.  Congratulations \n\nShe played a stupid game if it was a my friend will choose me over her career or choosing a caterer over you\n\nYour  friend is the AH  for been upset when she knew your priority was sent before she choose her date", "YTA. It\u2019s her wedding.", "NTA! You told her well in advance about your prior engagements. If her and her SO decided to move ahead with that same date that's on them not you. Unless she can pay you with consistent jobs every year like this festival you'd be dumb to pick her over it. It would be different if the festival hadn't set dates yet and she had and she had asked first. But that didn't happen", "Guilt is for when you do something that goes against your values. What you\u2019re feeling is not guilt. You are making a choice to honor yourself, passions, work. Breaking that would go against your values and integrity. \n\nHer booking on that day (if she had multiple options) is her wanting you to go against yourself to show how much you love her or she doesn\u2019t want you there. \n\nEither way, not a friend. \n\nSo proud of you for doing you - go have a great time at the festival and keep the friends who champion you!", "NTA\u2026 you have her a heads up, she chose it anyway.  That was her choice.  Wish her the best on the day of and tell her you can\u2019t wait to hear all about it.  No need to worry more about it.  If you are good friends you will survive missing the wedding and if she is that good of a friend you will eventually forgive her for picking the only date you couldn\u2019t attend.  If you guys don\u2019t move past it then the friendship wasn\u2019t as strong as you thought.", "NTA... A friend wouldn't ask you to blow your career in order to attend her wedding. It's not missing 'a day of work'. This is risking loosing your spot on a career altering oportunity. \n\nI'd not ask her to change her date, i'd just refocus. \"How can I help you get ready for your big day. I may not be able to share it with you, but we can have great memories getting you ready...\"\n\nIf somehow she doesn't accept this change in direction, well then it is all about her, and I'd step back from the close friend stage, and hope that some day in the future a two sided genuine friendship reamerges.", "NTA- you told her one weekend and she picked it", "Your career should not be undermined or jeopardized for the sake of one event, even if it\u2019s a wedding. You have worked hard to establish yourself in your field, and opportunities like Glastonbury are crucial for your growth and professional reputation. It\u2019s unfortunate that your friend doesn\u2019t fully grasp the significance of this.\n\nWhile it\u2019s understandable that she may be upset or disappointed, it\u2019s important for her to recognize the larger context and the sacrifices you\u2019ve made for your career.

Well in advance of her picking the day.\n\nOdds are you did yourself a favor.\n\nIn America the bridal party is picked way in advance,. It sounds like she didn't ask you to be a bridesmaid. She may have been expecting you to be her photographer.\n\nThe music industry may seem massive, but it's a small network of people.", "NTA at all, and I feel sad for you. That's really hurtful, and it's pretty manipulative of her to cry that you can't come when she willingly chose the ONE day you couldn't be there. I would tell her straight up that you are hurt she chose that day, and to stop acting as though that wasn't 100% her choice.", "NTA She picked it knowing you could not attend.

I hung on for longer than I should have as I also have serious abandonment issues. I finally realized that hanging tight to the friendship was doing a disservice to myself and I stepped back. I still talk to her, and we have fun when we occasionally hang out, but don't consider her a best friend or someone I can really count on during difficulties. You know what happened when I did that and respected myself? I met new people who treated me with respect and who actually do support me and are solid friends! It wasn't immediately, but I promise that if you respect yourself enough to honour your career commitment, you are making a choice that will have positive outcomes not only for your career, but in your personal life as well. I mean, I live in Canada and I know about Glastonbury, it is a BIG deal! Having planned a wedding myself, there were definitely different options for caterers, so she could have chosen a different date, you don't have that option to change the date of Glastonbury. Take care of yourself, she obviously isn't taking you into consideration.", "You told her an exact date , you wouldn't be available. \n\nShe chose it and who really cares about her reasons..lets be honest. \nNow shes upset you can't come?!!\nReally?!!\n\nThere are 365 days in a year. You said that day was a nogo.\nYour friend is a selfish person, and you need to forget the guilt and stop blaming yourself for this.\n\nI wish you a happy and beautiful life.\nDon't ever let someone push your boundaries ever!", "NAH she's trying to balance when all her vendors are available and which of those dates where they all are free works for the maximum number of people she loves. There's pretty rarely a perfect solution to all that. You're also trying to work on your career and this is a huge opportunity for you that you should be super excited for. Neither of you are assholes here but I think you (maybe her as well but it doesn't seem like you've said anything about her reaction) are taking her decision too personally.", "NTA. \n\nHowever, you shouldn\u2019t feel dissed by your friend. There may be extenuating circumstances on her end. She may not have understood how serious you were about the Glastonbury event. Follow through on what is important to you, but still be there for your friend in all other ways. \n\nI hate to put this here because you said you have abandonment issues. Sometimes people inadvertently cause others to abandon them simply by doing everything they can to stop that abandonment. They literally go overboard to be freely available to their friends.  That \u201cfreely available\u201d status implies that they place little value on their own time. Your friend may be treating you this way because you have treated yourself this way. In fact, you are even questioning whether YOU are TA in this situation, when your friend kind of is TA. You need to stick up for yourself here. Go to Glastonbury and make yourself proud by doing a fantastic job and, if you remember to do so, post an update with a link to your photos so we can see how great you did.\n\nYou only have yourself in the end. Don\u2019t let yourself down. \n\n\u201cNever depend upon a spouse or a trust fund. You never know when one may run out on you.\u201d", "NAH you both have priorities and on this matter they didn\u2019t converge. Sucks that you won\u2019t be able to attend but have fun at the festival.", "Outside of the AITA stuff. As someone that is also in the gig economy you will miss this wedding and many more. This is the sh*t my coworkers and I talk about all the time. Can't plan anything in advanced because you never know when your next gig is. And even if you plan for something, you somehow magically get a call to work so you have to flake out because, \"you never know when the next gig will be, so gotta do as many while the gettings good\". It sucks, everything's on standby.. for your work...", "NAH. You should choose to do the job but try to overcome the hurt. It sounds like your abandonment issues are magnifying the impact of this. She can\u2019t plan her wedding around you unfortunately.", "Did it ever come to your mind that there were other issued your friend was to take into consideration? Bc now you sound like you are the ONLY one reason for her.", "YTA - you explained what date you couldn't do before, just tell her again, and don't go. That would make it NAH - honestly, she has a lousy of people she needs to prioritise, such as her parents, the groom's parents, brothers & sisters, the venue, etc\n\nDon't take it personally", "NTA", "NTA. She knew that it was an important day for you and she chose THAT specific day for her wedding, she isn\u2019t a good friend.", "NTA, telling her you can\u2019t come is fine. But maybe have a good chat with her about the date that she picked and why? If she really is your friend there should be mutual understanding. Both can feel sad, but there has to be mutual understanding. If this doesn\u2019t happen, that will give you some insight that allows you to readjust your relationship.", "Please if she or anyone says to you \u201cit\u2019s just a job\u201d say to them well it\u2019s just her first wedding and my job pays my bill and I\u2019m making something of myself. She was told before she ever picked the day you wouldn\u2019t be available. She sounds like someone who likes drama and now she can tell everyone you aren\u2019t coming and she gets the attention. You are not wrong for working that day. Don\u2019t let her hurt your career", "NTA. \n\nThe date she picked is a date you can\u2019t make it because of a huge job. She\u2019s not allowed to be upset about that or make you feel guilty. And honestly how good a friend is she if she doesn\u2019t understand what a big opportunity this job is for you?\n\nYou simply can\u2019t make it. It\u2019s not your problem. Don\u2019t beat yourself up over something you have no control over.", "NTA - she either has ADHD or is kind of a dick", "Quit your gig, goto the wedding,get branded as \u201cunreliable\u201d in your field to all the big names, and never work another day.   I\u2019m sure uour friend has it covered /s\n\n\nNta", "You even told her! I mean... what does she expect from you?\n\nYWNBTA even if you hadn't spoken with her about it beforehand. That is a very important job for you. One you like and one that will go away if you \"just can't make it\". Networking is so important in your line of business! Imo you cannot afford to not do it, because you will probably not be asked next year, if you would.\n\nI would recommend talking to her though. Asking her why she picked that date, might help you understand. Who knows, maybe it's the only one her MIL can make it and that is admitably very important. If it's something like \"I liked that one best, you can just cancel that gig\" You should have a long talk about how her day is important, but your life, your career matters, too. Explain to her again why it is so imperative that you work that festival and what you would loose. I hope she will understand if you take the time for a long and calm talk...\n\nEdit: I just read in a comment it actually was \"because she liked that day best\" (because of the caterer). Well that is her choice, if the caterer is that important. The talk about it still stands.", "NTA You can\u2019t jeopardise your career/livelihood for her wedding.", "Nta", "NTA. Did you say, \"I told you the one day I couldn't do it, why did you pick that day?\". I'm sorry you have to cope with this, but don't feel you've done anything wrong. Maybe she genuinely forgot when picking the date, but your work is very important to you and you gave her the information she needed. Don't let her make this your mistake.", "NTA, and i hope you get main stage gig!", "NTA. Your friend should've respected your availability, especially if you told her beforehand. Work comes first sometimes!", "Self-centred idiot (the friend, not you, OP). She just expected you to give up a FABULOUS career opportunity for her, no questions asked. \n\nYou are NTA and obviously you're going to Glastonbury. \n\nI don't think she abandoned you - I genuinely think she assumed you'd be there because the two of you are so close (almost the opposite of abandonment).", "NTA - when I had my wedding I asked the people I would wanted to be there the most which date they prefer. Especially my nephew because he had finals coming up and had to learn a lot. He said, he could probably go a day without learning but I still chose the week after his finals.", "NTA. Perhaps she isn't either and that date is the only one they could make work for the rest of her families etc. And btw, I'm assuming June 29th 2024? since it's June 29th 2023 now?\n\nBut it's a mighty big coincidence. Especially if you were up front about it and let her know this from the start. Might be an unfortunate sign that she does not value your friendship as much as you do, as much as it sucks to realise that. That doesn't mean she doesn't value it at all, just that she values it differently. \n\nOn the one hand, I'd want to talk to her about it. And you probably need to, if only to clear the air. On the other hand, I'd just as soon send her a happy wedding day card or whatever (no gift, though!) and let it go. Let her reach out. And depending on how she reacts, you know where you stand.\n\nGlastonbury is an awesome festival to visit, let alone get the opportunity to cover one of the stages. Friends and family are important, but NEVER let them screw with your career or your money. Take awesome pictures, have lots of fun, go bag some big clients ;-)", "NTA - op should give an update on how this goes. I\u2019m curious why the friend did this", "NTA Don't you dare not do Glastonbury....bc then you'll lose your job, as well as your \"friend\". She isn't your friend, she made that VERY clear, why you're not getting the message, I don't know. She's just trying to ruin your professional life as well before she cuts you off completely out of her life. She's doing that probably bc she's a bad, evil person. Sorry for your abandonment issues, but sometimes it's necessary and good to cut people out of your life.", "Definitely NTA - why should you risk your entire career for one day; especially a day that she knew you could not attend.", "NTA she should be happy for yoj", "Yeah, I don't get that mindset.\n\n\"Here's a list of dates. Any that don't work for you?\"\n\n\"Just that one.\"\n\n\"Okay, I'll pick that one. Wait, why can't you come? Do you not love me?!!?! You should choose ME over your livelihood if you care about me!\"", "You got it... For me it's one of those things that if I chose that day knowing someone said they couldn't go... I wouldn't be mad at that person for not going... I don't think she's wrong to choose that date necessarily bc idk her reasoning, but she shouldn't be mad at op if it was clear there was a very serious reason op couldn't go.", "^This^, 100%. \n\nDon't let her guilt you into still doing a free photoshoot for the dressmaker.\nIf you still genuinely want to do it, go for it (you could even claim it as your wedding gift to her if you want to), but don't let her force you into anything, with \"but you promised me\"s, and, \"weddings are expensive, and this will really help me\"s.\nIt seems that she may not have a high respect for your time and/or profession (if she thought that the choice between her and your job would be easy, and on her side).\n\nDefinitely NTA OP. Take care of yourself, and talk it through with her when you're feeling up to it.", "> I don't know why she had to choose that weekend, but the results of doing so are 100% on her.\n\nHonestly? It was probably a power play. \u201cThe one day you can\u2019t come, eh? The one day I wouldn\u2019t be the center of the universe!? We\u2019ll see about that!\u201d", "I want to point this out because I have rejection sensitivity: she very likely didn't choose the caterer over you.\n\nI get what the other people are saying, and in a \"she doing wrong\" kind of way, they are right.\n\nBut, with the sensitivity, I think it is important for you to hear this. She probably thought she could convince you/ guilt you into sacrificing your well-being for her selfish wants. She probably thought she could have both.\n\nShe likes you, she wanted you at her wedding. She's just a really crap friend who wasn't concerned about *your* feelings.\n\nI don't know if this is a one off, but you might want to consider whether this is a pattern with her. How good of a friend is she to *you*?\n\nI've found myself ignoring wildly awful behaviour from friends because I was so scared of being rejected that I didn't stop to think about whether I actually wanted to be *their* friend. I think it's time to think about this for yourself.\n\nNot saying she's definitely awful and you need to ditch her. There's not enough to get a bigger picture of the friendship. But you do have that picture. Don't forget to look at it every once in a while.", "So the caterer is more important than you. I understand you have abandonment issue, but your friend made it clear where she stood on the friendship. She is perfectly ok not having you there.", "Like, this was the only date on the whole year the caterer was free, or what?", "Agreed. The friend's choice of that date was intentional and she's trying to get OP to choose the wedding over the Glastonbury job.", "In another comment OP said it was the date the caterer the friend wanted could do", "This response truly makes logical sense however with her friend upset so much makes me think otherwsie", "It\u2019s really not, plus the venue had multiple dates available. The friend asked which dates OP could do then picked the one they couldn\u2019t. Why ask if you\u2019re not going to take it into consideration? \n\nI\u2019d agree with N A H if the friend hadn\u2019t asked in the first place. She did, and then got upset because OP won\u2019t jeopardise their career to attend. That makes the friend the AH", "Hope glasto went well for you", "Im so happy to hear this \ud83d\udc9b and so sorry about your friend. It\u2019s a truly horrible feeling. Reassessing what you thought you knew. Feeling like you can\u2019t get perspective. Your feelings are valid.\n\nAs to your friend, did you talk to them to ask why they chose that date? Ask them, was there a good reason for choosing that date over the others? Or were you testing me? Did you want to see if I\u2019d make a huge sacrifice for your wedding? Do you just not care about my career? Or did you just not care about my being at your wedding? \n\nForce her to explain herself, not the other way around. You did nothing wrong. \n\nSometimes people are just really dumb. Weddings are stressful, and the relative importance of various considerations gets easily muddled. I hope that this is a case of someone getting overwhelmed and fucking up. However if your friend refuses to acknowledge the unnecessary stress they caused you I think it\u2019s time to draw some boundaries with them \ud83d\udc9b\n\nI hope you had an absolutely amazing time at Glastonbury. Seriously so happy for you realising your goals, amazing", "Yeah I was thinking the same. It\u2019s still an AH move however you slice it, but very likely not an \u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re there or not\u201d vibe. Much more likely an \u201cI\u2019m so important OF COURSE you will ditch everything else for me\u201d vibe.", "My inner cynic is wondering if the friend is secretly jealous about how successful OP's career is, and they secretly want OP to lose the  Glastonbury job, because it makes them feel inferior to OP. Maybe the friend just likes the idea of OP making a huge personal sacrifice for the sake of their friendship, it would make them (the friend) feel so special and beloved. Either scenario suggests the friend may have a massive inferiority complex. I hope for OP's sake I'm wrong.", "This was my thought in a way, of course she really cares if you attend and is very sad that you can't, but YOU are also very hurt for not being able to attend, (as previously mentioned, and therefore pretty much a set boundary for you.) So I can see both points. Best to just admit you're both upset because you both wanted to be there but can't make it happen. Don't feel bad about not sacrificing your livelihood, if you are good friends hopefully you'll both get over it.", "She might have agreed\u2026 on any other day! \n\nOP needs to reframe for themselves. This is not prioritizing \u2019work\u2019. This is prioritizing a cornerstone of her career, and that\u2019s too big an ask. \n\nHope Glasto is going well.", "It\u2019s Glastonbury weekend, pretty sure lots of guests are going to be annoyed she chose that weekend.", "I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss it. She knew you are busy on this day, if for some reason she didn't have a choice and had to agree to this date, the reasonable thing to do was to call/text you right away explaining things and ask if you could come. Instead of it she just sends you an invite as if there is no problem whatsoever. Think of it: she knew for days, if not weeks, that she picked the only day you had come. She didn't warn you. She keeps acting as if it's not a big deal - because for her it was.\n\nMaybe she didn't want to hurt you per se, but she sure doesn't care about your feelings, your life and your attendance. As other commenters are saying, you need to reevaluate your friendship - does she really count you as a close friend?", "This x1000. Some people never seem to learn the value of a relationship with a true friend. Their loss.", "This! She wants the drama and the ego boost of u choosing her over ur career. But I guarantee she will never do the same for u. If this is more than a one off, no \"friend\" is worth it. Friends, real Ines, respect that ur world doesn't recolve around them.", "Sadness is justified, yes. \nBut being upset OP can't make it is not. The bride knew in advance that if you choose this single date, I won't be able to attend, I can't miss that work thing. \n\nA good friend would say, \"I know I chose this date. It was the date my  favoured catere had open. I'm sad you won't be able to attend but I hope your job goes well, send me a congratulations card and I'll look forward to showing you the pictures of our wedding\" \nNot be upset when they already knew OP couldn't just throw the whole job away for her wedding.", "Could be a far stretch but it is under the realm of possiblity"]}
