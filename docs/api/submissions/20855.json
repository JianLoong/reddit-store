I said the only one I couldnt do would be June 29th because of Glastonbury and how important that job is to me in trying to maintain this relationship and hopefully get to one of the bigger stages in the future.

She could have picked another date but she chose that one.\n\nI feel really heart broken because I love her and I thought she loved me and I have been there for her through the whole wedding thing and even told her I would offer her wedding dress maker a free photoshoot if it would help bring the price of the dress down. \n\nBut now I feel shit because she obviously didn't care if I came or not if she picked the one day I couldn't do without fucking up a huge thing in my career.\n\nI have abandonment issues as well because of my family and it has made me feel that feeling of not being wanted.\n\nI know how stressful weddings are but I would never want a wedding without her there and now I feel so guilty that I can't go and also doubting why she would pick the one day I couldn't and she is upset and cried when I said I couldn't come even though she knew all along I wouldn't be able to without a huge blow to my career.

Her wedding doesn't pay your bills, but the gigs you might get definitely will.\n\nI don't know why she had to choose *that weekend,* but the results of doing so are 100% on her. Don't let her guilt you into doing HER a favor.", "Congrats on the job! That is insanely awesome. \n\nAs for the matter at hand, NTA 1000%. She knew the date and what she was doing or didn't listen to you AT ALL. Either way, that is on her.\n\nI say you need to do two things from here\n\n1. Get ahead of this with mutual friends. I say this because so often people will do things like this and then ride is for more attention, sympathy, etc. I'm not saying call her out in public or on sm, but saying anyone you both  know to find a way to bring it up. Or even better just announce publicly how excited you are about the Festival Job and put the date. GUSH about how great it is, what it does for your career, and how long you've known about it.\n\n2. Enjoy the festival", "NTA. Her wedding does not come before your own livelihood and career opportunities, and especially so when warned prior choosing the date.", "The caterer she liked was available that day I think is the main reason", "NTA. \n\nShe knew what she was doing when she picked that date. Otherwise she wouldn't be trying so hard to guilt you into giving up the festival; instead she would be sad but accepting that her choice of date was a no-go for you.", "NTA she knew and made a choice. I\u2019m guessing she hasn\u2019t given you a good reason for picking that date. If she has a good reason I would n a h but you don\u2019t guilt someone for not being available", "NTA she was aware that this was the one day you couldn\u2019t go and from what you say you let her know long ago, if she understood how big this was for you she would\u2019ve picked a different date, hopefully you manage to work something out though", "NTA\n\nIt was N A H until your friend got upset when you said you couldn\u2019t come.\n\nBut I do think you need to work through your feelings more. You\u2019ve written this as if she *specifically* chose the one date you couldn\u2019t attend as some sort of friendship test, when I\u2019m sure there\u2019s another reason.", "ESH.  They picked a date that worked for them, you can\u2019t make it.  That should be the end of it.  Her guilt-tripping you about not being able to make it is an asshole move, but so are your histrionics about how you must not matter to her at all since she picked the date you couldn\u2019t do.  The wedding is not about you, and she likely was balancing a bunch of competing considerations around the date.", "NTA. You gave her your availability and she ignored it. Don\u2019t feel guilty. I would NEVER do that to my best friend. I would plan my wedding making SURE she could be there. And then to make you feel guilty about your job? NO. That is not how a friend acts. \n\nFrankly I recommend you start thinking about your life ahead without her eventually. She is manipulative and does not have your best interests at heart. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9red flags everywhere.", "NTA. You can't be expected to sabotage your career to attend a wedding. The fact that you even told her in advance that you couldn't do that date makes you even less the asshole. She made the decision to have her wedding on that date, and she isn't entitled to have you show up at her wedding if you can't make it.", "NAH. scheduling conflicts happeb", "NTA.  She could\u2019ve planned her wedding around your schedule.  She knew the dates.", "YTA. She had other reasons to pick that day, as you said. You are not marrying her. You do not have to be there. There is no way for anyone to pick a wedding date that works for everyone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Weddings are very emotional and challenging. If brought up so much for me to plan one. It\u2019s almost impossible to plan something that everyone in your life can attend. There may be a lot of factors at play here that are not personal. It\u2019s worth an in-person conversation in my opinion.", "NTA. There are so many factors that enter into choosing a wedding date and there is often so much going on. I would give her the benefit of the doubt and assume it wasn\u2019t intentional. Don\u2019t throw away a relationship that you cherish.", "INFO had she been planning on your doing her wedding photos?", "NTA\n\nShe can't pick the one day you said you couldn't go to... and then be surprised when you can't go. People with abandonment issues often attract narcissistic people so I wouldn't be surprised if this was just the bride showing her true colors.", "One mutual friend messaged me because she knew I would be feeling bad thankfully", "Thanks for the congratulations it's huge and really hard work but so worth it.", "Then she made the choice of the caterer over you. You have nothing to feel guilty about. This is all on her - NTA.", "I didn't mention to her my feelings about how I felt about not mattering cause i know everything is raw and wanted to process and know I have issues with being left out so this is fair and I am glad I didnt", "Thank you for this. There are dozens of factors when selecting a wedding date and no matter how considerate the bridal couple are, someone will not be able to attend or participate. It's scheduling, not personal.\n\nI'm going to be charitable and also say ESH - OP and bride both are very disappointed but should be handling it better.", "No because I have no photographing friends weddings rule", "It became personal when she tried to emotionally manipulate OP into going and losing this career opportunity. Crying about them not being able to go despite being told well in advance about that being the one time they couldn't attend? Talk about bad acting. NTA. The bride and groom can choose when they want to get married naturally, it's their wedding, but they also can't guilt people into going when those people have prior commitments."]}
