I say this because so often people will do things like this and then ride is for more attention, sympathy, etc. I'm not saying call her out in public or on sm, but saying anyone you both  know to find a way to bring it up. Or even better just announce publicly how excited you are about the Festival Job and put the date. GUSH about how great it is, what it does for your career, and how long you've known about it.\n\n2.

This is so incredibly important- don\u2019t you let anything stand in your way! You did all you could reasonably do to be there for her wedding, the rest is hers to deal with as she will. I do not like her trying to guilt you about it. This has to be a hardline for you. Never light yourself on fire to keep anyone warm. You\u2019re NTA!

Believe it or not there are usually a number of factors that couples need to decide on dates and your professional success shouldn't be one of them!\n\nYou'll need to come to a decision that doesn't offload all responsibility onto the marrying couple.

Seems to be done on purpose, especially since she had other options.", "NTA \n\nHere\u2019s my take on it. You both have mutual respect and admiration for each other. She unfortunately screwed up in her planning. Being a bride comes with a lot of pressure and so many moving parts. I don\u2019t think she purposely forgot, it just got misplaced during her decision making. There\u2019s nothing either one of you can do to make both of you happy. You have to work with what you have and go with it. Plan a special day just the two of you. After the wedding/honeymoon have a girls night where she shares wedding memories and you share festival details.", "I'm wondering whether OP was supposed to be photographer at wedding and just didn't know yet.

At least you know you will have some support if bride goes stupid.", "Definitely NTA  there a hundreds of caterers in the world, very few good friends.", "Sadness is 1000% justified. For both of you.", "But friend does need to take responsibility for her own sad feelings instead of trying to blame them on OP and guilt tripping OP for \"picking work over her wedding\". Because the friend \"picked\" wedding logistics over their friendship first.", "NTA. But this actually has nothing to do with you, and you need to realize that. It's her wedding, and she might not have a choice with dates due to the venue or what her fiance wanted. You dont know what it was. \n\nThe fact of the matter is, they were only thinking about what they wanted for their wedding which only has to do with them and only them. It had nothing to do with you. You can't take this personally. \n\nUnfortunately for her, you can't make her wedding. She might have forgotten the dates you couldn't go. But realistically, I'm picking the date that i want, not the one that works for just one individual. Wven if it's my best friend. That's the reality. \n\nHer wedding is not about you, so stop making it seem like it is. Your abandonment issue has nothing to do with her wedding day. You need to let it go. You're disappointed, but its out of your control.", "Way to go in the job.  Congratulations \n\nShe played a stupid game if it was a my friend will choose me over her career or choosing a caterer over you\n\nYour  friend is the AH  for been upset when she knew your priority was sent before she choose her date", "YTA. It\u2019s her wedding.", "NTA! You told her well in advance about your prior engagements. If her and her SO decided to move ahead with that same date that's on them not you. Unless she can pay you with consistent jobs every year like this festival you'd be dumb to pick her over it. It would be different if the festival hadn't set dates yet and she had and she had asked first. But that didn't happen", "Guilt is for when you do something that goes against your values. What you\u2019re feeling is not guilt. You are making a choice to honor yourself, passions, work. Breaking that would go against your values and integrity. \n\nHer booking on that day (if she had multiple options) is her wanting you to go against yourself to show how much you love her or she doesn\u2019t want you there. \n\nEither way, not a friend. \n\nSo proud of you for doing you - go have a great time at the festival and keep the friends who champion you!", "NTA\u2026 you have her a heads up, she chose it anyway.  That was her choice.  Wish her the best on the day of and tell her you can\u2019t wait to hear all about it.  No need to worry more about it.  If you are good friends you will survive missing the wedding and if she is that good of a friend you will eventually forgive her for picking the only date you couldn\u2019t attend.  If you guys don\u2019t move past it then the friendship wasn\u2019t as strong as you thought.", "NTA... A friend wouldn't ask you to blow your career in order to attend her wedding. It's not missing 'a day of work'. This is risking loosing your spot on a career altering oportunity. \n\nI'd not ask her to change her date, i'd just refocus. \"How can I help you get ready for your big day. I may not be able to share it with you, but we can have great memories getting you ready...\"\n\nIf somehow she doesn't accept this change in direction, well then it is all about her, and I'd step back from the close friend stage, and hope that some day in the future a two sided genuine friendship reamerges.", "NTA- you told her one weekend and she picked it", "Your career should not be undermined or jeopardized for the sake of one event, even if it\u2019s a wedding. You have worked hard to establish yourself in your field, and opportunities like Glastonbury are crucial for your growth and professional reputation. It\u2019s unfortunate that your friend doesn\u2019t fully grasp the significance of this.\n\nWhile it\u2019s understandable that she may be upset or disappointed, it\u2019s important for her to recognize the larger context and the sacrifices you\u2019ve made for your career.

Well in advance of her picking the day.\n\nOdds are you did yourself a favor.\n\nIn America the bridal party is picked way in advance,. It sounds like she didn't ask you to be a bridesmaid. She may have been expecting you to be her photographer.\n\nThe music industry may seem massive, but it's a small network of people.", "NTA at all, and I feel sad for you. That's really hurtful, and it's pretty manipulative of her to cry that you can't come when she willingly chose the ONE day you couldn't be there. I would tell her straight up that you are hurt she chose that day, and to stop acting as though that wasn't 100% her choice.", "NTA She picked it knowing you could not attend.

I hung on for longer than I should have as I also have serious abandonment issues. I finally realized that hanging tight to the friendship was doing a disservice to myself and I stepped back. I still talk to her, and we have fun when we occasionally hang out, but don't consider her a best friend or someone I can really count on during difficulties. You know what happened when I did that and respected myself? I met new people who treated me with respect and who actually do support me and are solid friends! It wasn't immediately, but I promise that if you respect yourself enough to honour your career commitment, you are making a choice that will have positive outcomes not only for your career, but in your personal life as well. I mean, I live in Canada and I know about Glastonbury, it is a BIG deal! Having planned a wedding myself, there were definitely different options for caterers, so she could have chosen a different date, you don't have that option to change the date of Glastonbury. Take care of yourself, she obviously isn't taking you into consideration.", "You told her an exact date , you wouldn't be available. \n\nShe chose it and who really cares about her reasons..lets be honest. \nNow shes upset you can't come?!!\nReally?!!\n\nThere are 365 days in a year. You said that day was a nogo.\nYour friend is a selfish person, and you need to forget the guilt and stop blaming yourself for this.\n\nI wish you a happy and beautiful life.\nDon't ever let someone push your boundaries ever!", "NAH she's trying to balance when all her vendors are available and which of those dates where they all are free works for the maximum number of people she loves. There's pretty rarely a perfect solution to all that. You're also trying to work on your career and this is a huge opportunity for you that you should be super excited for. Neither of you are assholes here but I think you (maybe her as well but it doesn't seem like you've said anything about her reaction) are taking her decision too personally.", "NTA. \n\nHowever, you shouldn\u2019t feel dissed by your friend. There may be extenuating circumstances on her end. She may not have understood how serious you were about the Glastonbury event. Follow through on what is important to you, but still be there for your friend in all other ways. \n\nI hate to put this here because you said you have abandonment issues. Sometimes people inadvertently cause others to abandon them simply by doing everything they can to stop that abandonment. They literally go overboard to be freely available to their friends.  That \u201cfreely available\u201d status implies that they place little value on their own time. Your friend may be treating you this way because you have treated yourself this way. In fact, you are even questioning whether YOU are TA in this situation, when your friend kind of is TA. You need to stick up for yourself here. Go to Glastonbury and make yourself proud by doing a fantastic job and, if you remember to do so, post an update with a link to your photos so we can see how great you did.\n\nYou only have yourself in the end.

My husband picked our wedding day based off of some complex mathematical formula he put together with all the numbers which I don\u2019t really get but it was important to him so that\u2019s the day we got married).
