I say this because so often people will do things like this and then ride is for more attention, sympathy, etc. I'm not saying call her out in public or on sm, but saying anyone you both  know to find a way to bring it up. Or even better just announce publicly how excited you are about the Festival Job and put the date. GUSH about how great it is, what it does for your career, and how long you've known about it.\n\n2.

I would NEVER do that to my best friend. I would plan my wedding making SURE she could be there. And then to make you feel guilty about your job? NO.

This is so incredibly important- don\u2019t you let anything stand in your way! You did all you could reasonably do to be there for her wedding, the rest is hers to deal with as she will. I do not like her trying to guilt you about it. This has to be a hardline for you. Never light yourself on fire to keep anyone warm. You\u2019re NTA!

Seems to be done on purpose, especially since she had other options.", "NTA \n\nHere\u2019s my take on it. You both have mutual respect and admiration for each other. She unfortunately screwed up in her planning. Being a bride comes with a lot of pressure and so many moving parts. I don\u2019t think she purposely forgot, it just got misplaced during her decision making. There\u2019s nothing either one of you can do to make both of you happy. You have to work with what you have and go with it. Plan a special day just the two of you. After the wedding/honeymoon have a girls night where she shares wedding memories and you share festival details.", "I'm wondering whether OP was supposed to be photographer at wedding and just didn't know yet.

Because the friend \"picked\" wedding logistics over their friendship first.", "NTA. But this actually has nothing to do with you, and you need to realize that. It's her wedding, and she might not have a choice with dates due to the venue or what her fiance wanted. You dont know what it was. \n\nThe fact of the matter is, they were only thinking about what they wanted for their wedding which only has to do with them and only them. It had nothing to do with you. You can't take this personally. \n\nUnfortunately for her, you can't make her wedding. She might have forgotten the dates you couldn't go. But realistically, I'm picking the date that i want, not the one that works for just one individual. Wven if it's my best friend. That's the reality. \n\nHer wedding is not about you, so stop making it seem like it is. Your abandonment issue has nothing to do with her wedding day. You need to let it go. You're disappointed, but its out of your control.", "Way to go in the job.  Congratulations \n\nShe played a stupid game if it was a my friend will choose me over her career or choosing a caterer over you\n\nYour  friend is the AH  for been upset when she knew your priority was sent before she choose her date", "YTA. It\u2019s her wedding.", "NTA! You told her well in advance about your prior engagements. If her and her SO decided to move ahead with that same date that's on them not you. Unless she can pay you with consistent jobs every year like this festival you'd be dumb to pick her over it. It would be different if the festival hadn't set dates yet and she had and she had asked first. But that didn't happen", "Guilt is for when you do something that goes against your values. What you\u2019re feeling is not guilt. You are making a choice to honor yourself, passions, work. Breaking that would go against your values and integrity. \n\nHer booking on that day (if she had multiple options) is her wanting you to go against yourself to show how much you love her or she doesn\u2019t want you there. \n\nEither way, not a friend. \n\nSo proud of you for doing you - go have a great time at the festival and keep the friends who champion you!", "NTA\u2026 you have her a heads up, she chose it anyway.  That was her choice.  Wish her the best on the day of and tell her you can\u2019t wait to hear all about it.  No need to worry more about it.  If you are good friends you will survive missing the wedding and if she is that good of a friend you will eventually forgive her for picking the only date you couldn\u2019t attend.  If you guys don\u2019t move past it then the friendship wasn\u2019t as strong as you thought.", "NTA... A friend wouldn't ask you to blow your career in order to attend her wedding. It's not missing 'a day of work'. This is risking loosing your spot on a career altering oportunity. \n\nI'd not ask her to change her date, i'd just refocus. \"How can I help you get ready for your big day. I may not be able to share it with you, but we can have great memories getting you ready...\"\n\nIf somehow she doesn't accept this change in direction, well then it is all about her, and I'd step back from the close friend stage, and hope that some day in the future a two sided genuine friendship reamerges.", "NTA- you told her one weekend and she picked it", "Your career should not be undermined or jeopardized for the sake of one event, even if it\u2019s a wedding. You have worked hard to establish yourself in your field, and opportunities like Glastonbury are crucial for your growth and professional reputation. It\u2019s unfortunate that your friend doesn\u2019t fully grasp the significance of this.\n\nWhile it\u2019s understandable that she may be upset or disappointed, it\u2019s important for her to recognize the larger context and the sacrifices you\u2019ve made for your career.

She may have been expecting you to be her photographer.\n\nThe music industry may seem massive, but it's a small network of people.", "NTA at all, and I feel sad for you. That's really hurtful, and it's pretty manipulative of her to cry that you can't come when she willingly chose the ONE day you couldn't be there. I would tell her straight up that you are hurt she chose that day, and to stop acting as though that wasn't 100% her choice.", "NTA She picked it knowing you could not attend.

I hung on for longer than I should have as I also have serious abandonment issues. I finally realized that hanging tight to the friendship was doing a disservice to myself and I stepped back. I still talk to her, and we have fun when we occasionally hang out, but don't consider her a best friend or someone I can really count on during difficulties. You know what happened when I did that and respected myself? I met new people who treated me with respect and who actually do support me and are solid friends! It wasn't immediately, but I promise that if you respect yourself enough to honour your career commitment, you are making a choice that will have positive outcomes not only for your career, but in your personal life as well. I mean, I live in Canada and I know about Glastonbury, it is a BIG deal! Having planned a wedding myself, there were definitely different options for caterers, so she could have chosen a different date, you don't have that option to change the date of Glastonbury. Take care of yourself, she obviously isn't taking you into consideration.", "You told her an exact date , you wouldn't be available. \n\nShe chose it and who really cares about her reasons..lets be honest. \nNow shes upset you can't come?!!\nReally?!!\n\nThere are 365 days in a year. You said that day was a nogo.\nYour friend is a selfish person, and you need to forget the guilt and stop blaming yourself for this.\n\nI wish you a happy and beautiful life.\nDon't ever let someone push your boundaries ever!", "NAH she's trying to balance when all her vendors are available and which of those dates where they all are free works for the maximum number of people she loves. There's pretty rarely a perfect solution to all that. You're also trying to work on your career and this is a huge opportunity for you that you should be super excited for. Neither of you are assholes here but I think you (maybe her as well but it doesn't seem like you've said anything about her reaction) are taking her decision too personally.", "NTA. \n\nHowever, you shouldn\u2019t feel dissed by your friend. There may be extenuating circumstances on her end. She may not have understood how serious you were about the Glastonbury event.

Sometimes people inadvertently cause others to abandon them simply by doing everything they can to stop that abandonment. They literally go overboard to be freely available to their friends.  That \u201cfreely available\u201d status implies that they place little value on their own time. Your friend may be treating you this way because you have treated yourself this way. In fact, you are even questioning whether YOU are TA in this situation, when your friend kind of is TA. You need to stick up for yourself here. Go to Glastonbury and make yourself proud by doing a fantastic job and, if you remember to do so, post an update with a link to your photos so we can see how great you did.\n\nYou only have yourself in the end.

Iam sure she would love you there.  A talk is in order here.", "Definitely NTA. She asked, you told her which didn't work. Her wedding is a \"one and done.\" Your job/career is not. It's unfortunate you will have to miss the wedding, and it's reasonable you're upset, but in this case, your long term goal has to take precedence. Her being upset at you for something you stated well before a date was chosen is truly unfair.", "NTA But I feel like there\u2019s a part of the story that we\u2019re missing and that is your friend side of the story of why she absolutely had to choose the one date that you were not available? Did you ask her that question?", "NTA - It seems like she may have done that on purpose to make you choose her over your dream. Some people are messed up like that. It is some weird test to see how much you love them or would sacrifice for them. Follow your dream and enjoy it. Don\u2019t feel bad about missing the wedding. The friendship wasn\u2019t what you thought it was and she sounds like she might not be a good person. You\u2019ll make new friends in life, especially as your career blossoms. Enjoy Glastonbury. I hope it leads to bigger and better opportunities.  Good luck.", "NTA, but as a friend who forgets dates allot is she maybe like me and possibly just a brain fart, I try so hard to not forget dates or events but lately with my kids I literally have to write things down or else I really do forget.", "Maybe it's a test, maybe she doesn't actually want you there, either way NTA", "Look. There\u2019s a significantly high chance the marriage isn\u2019t going to last since divorce rates are so high, so there\u2019ll be another wedding for her that you can attend. Silver lining.", "NTA. Regardless of her reasoning for choosing that day but honestly why on earth would she choose that day?? Bizarre. Sorry OP but don\u2019t feel guilty it\u2019s not your fault. She made a bad call.", "This is the shittiest thing your friend could ever do! I know how you must feel. But PLEASE do your dreamwork! She is not paying your bills. I might wonder if she chose that date just to get prove that you are her \"friend\" when you choose to go to her wedding. Just because. But that does not make her a friend at all", "NTA.\n\nAs a freelancer in another business I have had to say no to weddings for the same reasons. My mother once put it like this: nobody else is giving up a significant part of their yearly salary and the risk of not being booked again ever when I was having trouble deciding if I should cancel a gig I was booked for to attend a family member's wedding. I told them I couldn't come and sent them a present. Everybody understood.", "OP \ud83d\uded1\ud83d\uded1\ud83d\uded1\n\nThis is completely frustrating, I'm not marginalizing that.\n\nUntil you speak with her directly You cannot make a judgment, this is so unhealthy for you and is triggering all of your insecurities.\n\nIf she's truly a great friend reach out to her and say I'm so disappointed I can't be there, it feels like you're picking this date over me. Let her tell you why she picked that date, this is her wedding and there could be legitimate reasons such as the parents availability, the venue and yes even the caterer.... Please don't say there are millions of caterers out there, this is the once in a lifetime opportunity to get married and people want what they want.\n\nIt would have been great if she had reached out to you first and said I'm so sorry This is the date that works and it crushes me that you can't be here, but sometimes people don't do the right thing or even realize it until after the fact. She may not realize that she's hurt you at all, if she's truly a great friend take the time to talk about it first. This may not have anything to do with you and she may not have known how to approach you about it.", "Gonna go NAH\n\nSometimes you have to put your career over other things. This looks like one of them.\n\nIt appears that it's still early, why did she pick that date? You mentioned a caterer, so if that's it then that's an okay reason. I would still have picked a different date to have my friend there even if it meant I didn't get the perfect caterer. But it's her wedding and you should be happy for her.", "NTA\u2026 don\u2019t lose this opportunity. OP, you were clear about which date was a red line. The bride can be disappointed, but if she\u2019s truly your best friend, she would have been listening all this time about how important this date and job were\u2026. And if the bride can\u2019t get over it- doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s a very good friend.", "I'm sorry you're so hurt, you seem to really value your friendship. But you're NTA in any way, shape, or form. You told her the one day you weren't available, and for some reason she picked that date. It's unfortunate, but you did nothing wrong here. Good luck with your career and your friendship if you decide to repair it", "NAH.  You were upfront about what you couldn\u2019t do. She needed to pick that date for whatever reason for her wedding. It sucks, but C\u2019est la vie.", "INFO: Has she given any reason for her needing to pick that date?\n\nEDIT: Still would be a NTA vote because even if she really needed that date, you already told her you can't do that because of a huge work opportunity, you told her in advance so she knew the outcome and it is not fair to guilt you for not going.", "NTA\nI would also like to add, that friends come and go. (Unfortunately). I'm not sure how old you are, but from my +45 years of having friends come into & out of my life it seems to  happen about every 5 years or so. \n\nPeople change over time, & drift apart.  I say stick to your growing career, and if she says something to the effect of \" I can't believe you won't be there\" , you could say something like yes it is unfortunate, but I did tell you there was a big opportunity for me, on that day, is there a reason you had to choose it?  \n\nI would also like you to brace for how things in your friendship are going to look after she's married. Assuming you both move past from the wedding date issue, there's a good chance that hanging out with just her could start to be limited. Her life is going in the direction of husband & probably building a family, while you are trying to achieve something you have always dreamed of! \n\nStick to your dreams & career! Who knows, you may strike up a new friendship with someone that shares your passion.", "NTA.  You told her ahead how important to your career this one day was and how you would not be available.  She chose it anyway.  Maybe she couldn't get another date that worked for her.  That doesn't mean it should cost your friendship.

Celebrate at a later time together, maybe a girls' trip somewhere or something or girls' weekend.", "She chose this knowing how important this day is for your career.  She has no right to be mad.  She\u2019s not that good of a friend.\n\nEnjoy the festival! (Although I think it happened already).

And not on 29th.", "NTA, a company like the BBC hiring you to do an event as huge as Glastonbury is not one you pull out of unless something major is happening.

She doesn't seem like a very good friend. She shows you different dates, and the only one you can't do is the one she picks, now she's trying to guilt you into coming on the one day you can't make it... Tell her to drop it. YOU CANT MAKE IT, END OF DISCUSSION. She knew this would be the end result, and her wedding does not trump your livelihood. Just tell her congratulations, and move on.", "I've had to miss 2 weddings because of similar situation. Both of my friends understood when I explained why I could not go.", "NTA", "Never attribute to malice what can be attributed to human stupidity. But you are NTA Op.

Very gently I remind you, this is not all about you.\n\nThat said, she\u2019s guilting you about missing the wedding which is obnoxious and unfair. She doesn\u2019t have to schedule her wedding around you, but you don\u2019t have to schedule work around her.

Unintentionally. Support her through her guilt and remorse about that, then shoot your gig with a clear conscience.", "NTA. You told her you couldn\u2019t do that one day and that\u2019s the one she picked. Your inability to attend now is completely her own fault. Please do not give up your dream, your friend sounds selfish as hell like she did it intentionally to see if you\u2019d choose her over your career. If she was really your best friend she never would have put you in that position.", "NTA. She knew and this move feels like a power trip to see if she can make you choose between a career or her. This is an incredible opportunity and the fact you keep getting called back to do it is incredible. The fact she basically want you to burn the bridge you are building with the BBC shows she isn't a very good friend. A good friend would never have put you in that position and wouldn't be trying to guilt you into possibly permanently stalling out your career.", "NTA. She probably picked that day thinking you would skip Glastonbury so you could be there for her and surprise she wants you to be her photographer.", "Why would you feel guilty?  You TOLD her it was a bad date for you. You did your part.  Look. Hear me out. I know this sounds like a huge blow. But maybe she had so many people in her ear that she vegged and chose the date not remembering y\u2019all\u2019s discussion. It sucks. It\u2019s a hit for both of you. But it\u2019s not the end of the world. You can take photos before the wedding of her in her dress. You can do some exclusive photos of her and her husband after the wedding. You both, if you really mean that much to each other, will come up with a plan to work it out. Will you be there on the big day. Absolutely not. You have a previous engagement that means a lot to you. You mustn\u2019t miss it for the world. She will have several people video taping the wedding. Y\u2019all can watch it together when you get back. Have a nice watch party to celebrate. Honestly. Shit happens. I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t do it intentionally. She is gutted. But is doesn\u2019t have to be the end of a friendship. It doesn\u2019t mean abandonment. It\u2019s just a sad turn of events. If she cares about you she will understand you must be elsewhere. And if you care about her you\u2019ll understand how batshit crazy things get planning a wedding. You literally have 10 people talking to you at once about every detail. Y\u2019all work it out. Don\u2019t be hard on each other. I wish you both all the best.", "NAH, there will be people who can't come on each date your friend picked for their wedding. It's just that everyone has different responsibilities to work and other commitments. It's sad your friend is unconvinced of how it will impact your career to miss the very good job opportunity. It's a real shame but I think you have to go to the festival for your career! You friend has to make peace with their decision on the date picked and that not everyone can make it, it is just tough luck.", "It\u2019s not just work over her big day.

I too, used to struggle with abandonment issues; so much so, that I\u2019d hand on to unhealthy relationships too long. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like she cares much for your career or your goals. I\u2019m just an old broad who\u2019s not into music. I listen to books in my car and house, but even I know about Glastonbury. This year made history. The sun going down on Elton John? The fucking multitude lifting up Lewis Capaldi??? \n\nAnd there you are, with your foot, firmly planted in the BBC\u2019s fricking ground taking pictures? If you were my kid, I\u2019d be bragging my head off about you!!! \n\nSeriously my friend, take a step back. Try to look at your friendship objectively. Are your abandonment issues causing you to hang on to someone best let go of? Only you can answer that question. Otherwise, send a nice gift and critique her wedding pictures later.", "NTA and there's also this to consider: is the friend freaking out because she expects OP to be the photographer? Perhaps for free?", "NTA.  She was well-warned.  There must be a reason the couple chose that date (she didn't choose it alone) and she brushed off your unavailability.  Did you ask out of curiosity? I'd be  disappointed but I dont know their other decision factors.  It is what it is, they did what they had to do, so you do the same and go enjoy Glastonbury.", "NTA", "NTA. She knew that you can't at that day and now she acts all outraged. She for sure thought she could guilt you into still coming, caring only about herself and not about your feelings.", "YTA. Her wedding is not about you.", "Three possibilities.  One, there are other legitimate reasons that that was the only day that would work for the majority of her family, so even though she knew you couldn\u2019t be there she had to choose that date.  That\u2019s legit because she can\u2019t necessarily please everyone.  In that case she should absolutely not expect you to attend.  Second, she chose it because it was best for her and she\u2019s hoping you will go anyway (don\u2019t, you are under no obligation).  Three, she forgot.", "NTA-you wanted to be there for your friend and I think you guys can talk it out I hope it gets better", "NTA OP, stand firm. A wedding is one day, a job is way more important AND you were SO clear!!!", "There is no asshole. You just can't make the wedding because of a work commitment.", "NTA but I need more info on why she picked that date? Did she think that her best friend would choose to go to her wedding over work? Is it a better date than the others? Cheaper? Is it the only date that works for her or anyone else close to her.  We\u2019re missing a lot of the reasons on her side.  Are the other dates in July or August and potentially hotter? Does she know or understand that this job is vital to your career??", "I'd never make my friend choose me and loss of income over a paycheck and such a huge opportunity. Go get that bag sis NTA", "Nah/nta\nGood for you that you recognise that this is a trigger for you, its the critical first step in working through your trauma and healing so you don't have to spend your whole life being triggered. \n\nThere might be a really good reason she picked that date - have you asked?\nMaybe someone else could only do that date and she thought yours was a preference rather than an essential. \nMaybe she has her own issues and needed to make you choose so she felt important. \n\nWhatever her reasons, they're about her rather than you. Ultimately its her day, she gets to choose when it is, and you get to choose whether you go. \n\nNone of that changes the underlying value of your friendship, unless you choose to let it.", "NTA. But please,  please, for your own food,  google \"people pleasing\" and if it's at all possible for you,  consider going to therapy.  I understand feeling guilty in a situation like this, even if a million people tell you that there's nothing to be feeling guilty about.  But you don't have to keep feeling like this. \nAnd remember, your presence at the wedding has little bearing on the success of the wedding,  but your presence at the festival has a huge impact on your career.  She's demanding you sacrifice your career for a little hand-holding during the ceremony.

But she is really upset that I am picking work over her wedding and I can't help but feel guilty.\n\nShe's the asshole. It is not cool to request someone screw up their job for years to come over a wedding. Much less when she was warned. Performative crying is also an asshole tactic. NTA. Don't screw up your job.\n\nShe picked that date because the caterer she liked the most was available that day. Just ignore her.\n\n>She does however want my boyfriend to DJ the wedding which he was going to do for free but he now feels weird.\n\nHaaaaa. No. She's an asshole. She tried to f you over for a caterer and she wants this huge favor. Nope.", "NTA. Your friend made a choice knowing your prior obligations.

I\u2019m sorry you won\u2019t be able to attend your friend\u2019s wedding. She knew your one date and still chose to make it that day. Life happens, she\u2019ll have to adjust. \n\nYou can\u2019t put off this opportunity.

No matter what, kick ass and I want hear alllll about it when we see each other next. I love you not matter what my cherished friend\u201d.", "NTA it sounds like she picked that day to make you chose her instead of your career and blame you for not coming.

It\u2019s unlikely she choose that date to spite you.", "Nobody is the asshole. You will miss your best friends wedding. Don\u2019t read into why she chose that date over the other options.

A wedding day is a big thing though, and there are a multitude of people that have certain dates that can and can't work for them\n\nPoint is, there are lots of variables that go into choosing a date for the wedding and jumping to the conclusion that OP's friend is intentionally trying to hurt OP or isn't a friend is a very typical Reddit leap. OP doesn't need to divorce their friend, they just won't be able to attend the wedding.", "Op already did explain this to her. OP told her BEFORE the date was even picked, so the bride KNEW that if she chose this day, that OP would not be able to go. And the response that OP got, was a bunch of guilt and manipulation into trying to give up the job that they got in order to go to the wedding. \ud83e\udd37\ud83e\udd37 It's in the original post.", "Yes she can hold her wedding whenever she wants, but trying to guilt Opie into missing a job for the wedding, is not okay. That's what makes the bride the ah here.", "The fact that the bride immediately started trying to guilt and manipulate OP into giving up this job in order to go to the wedding though, is massive ah territory, especially considering the bride already knew about this before the date was picked.

She was in the wrong the minute she started trying to manipulate the situation.", "How hard is it to Google next year's Glastonbury Festival dates?\n\n> Glastonbury Festival 2024 will run from Wednesday 26th June to Sunday 30th June.\n\nCongrats on making a fool of yourself.", "Either set of parents availability, venue availability, groom's preference - lots of factors.

I told you before. \n\nI guess you don\u2019t like me anymore. Right?!\u201d", "I think the issue is her reaction. I asked my friends for dates they can\u2019t do next year. it\u2019s really hard to find one everyone can make. Then every venue we looked at only had one or two dates still available. We had to pick one in the end but I\u2019m apologetic to the friends who might not make it and completely understand they won\u2019t be there if they have other commitments!", "It could also be someone closer to her couldn't make the other dates.  Sometimes it is the least bad choice", "My brother got married to only weekend I could have had final uni exams. We got lucky and I only had the Thursday before but I told him a year in advance and he said if I had an exam I could just retake in the summer and not graduate with my friends.", "Exactly, it is literally ONE weekend that OP cannot do. \n\nThere are 360 other days in the year that would have been fine", "It may have been the only date she could get the location and vendors she wanted. Maybe she had multiple people with multiple blackout days?\n\nIt suck\u2019s, but as long as the bride isn\u2019t constantly guilting the OP I can\u2019t see how anyone is the AH here. The bride can be sad she can\u2019t come, but realize there are only so many weekend days a year with good weather.", "Yup. This is it. OP, I'd be returning my friendship completely. She clearly has very little respect for you if she's actually trying to guilt you into going.", "I don\u2019t think it necessarily is \u2018knowing full well\u2019. Yes OPs friend definitely had gotten all the info so they could have been aware it would make OP not be able to go.\n\n\nBut I\u2019ll give OPs friend the benefit of the doubt. planing a big event, especially a wedding is a lot.\nSo many people, so many things to coordinate and keep track off.\n\n\nEntirely possible OPs friend was talking to OP about dates a bit casually maybe weeks before. Heard the date they said they couldn\u2019t. And didn\u2019t make much note of it, as it wasn\u2019t one of their preferred dates they were mainly looking at anyway so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\n\n\nThen later down the line, maybe weeks later when finding a caterer they really like, turns out they can\u2019t any of their first hand picks for dates, they look for any dates that would work. Not really remembering that OP had mentioned a date they wouldn\u2019t be able to attend the wedding.\n\n\nMaybe they should have written it down or something else. But I think there are many scenarios, where OPs friend didn\u2019t remember that there would be a issue for OP with the date.\n\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it wasn\u2019t important to OPs friend to have them at the weddings\npeople mess up big important things when planning their wedding all the time.

We don\u2019t know the availability of caterers locally. \n\nThe reality is there are only so many weekends a year. Even less with nice weather. After Covid, you had a large number of brides who had to postpone their wedding now back planning on top of the normal amount. It used to be recommended you start planning a year out, but I\u2019ve seen the recommendation even longer now. \n\nSo reducing it to \u201ccaterer vs friend\u201d is definitely something I would see on Reddit.  The reality is planning a wedding is coordinating multiple caterers while trying to make sure the date works for all your friends and families. Often times that\u2019s not possible. She\u2019s not an ass for picking a date that doesn\u2019t work for the Op. she\u2019s not an ass for being sad the Op can\u2019t go. She will be an ass if she guilts then OP.", "This behavior is so egregious and disrespectful I would be very surprised if there WASN'T a pattern of behavior...", "AND I assume the friend knows how much she means to OP that she has knows OP would happily be the photographer no questions asked!\n\nI\u2019m really sorry OP - I hope I\u2019m not making any assumptions and that your friend wasn\u2019t using you, but do make sure that you are sticking to your values! If a friend is a true one they will respect that. Personally, I would put a friend before a caterer - you can find another good caterer and will see them for one day, but she should put you above the caterer.\n\nCongratulations on Glastonbury!

I made the choices I had to for the work I needed, for whatever many reasons I have that she may not be aware of. It\u2019s a sad situation. I hope we help each other through the sadness of it and maintain our relationship.\u2019\n\nETA: I think she probably doesn\u2019t understand the full motivations for you working that weekend, and expected it would be an easy sacrifice for you to make. I think the best resolution would be to communicate with love, and explain exactly why this work is important to you, and give her some context, so she doesn\u2019t view it as \u2018she could work literally any other festival, or weekend, but I can\u2019t have decent catering any other weekend\u2019.\n\nHelp her understand. And appreciate that you may not realise the full constraints she\u2019s working under, either; catering sounds like an easy thing to fix, but her event is dependent on the schedules of many other loved ones and family, and all her partner\u2019s loved ones and family, and catering has to somehow fit between all that.

Certainly, the day is very special for them, and hopefully, the new couple will feel celebrated, but there are some things that can't be avoided. A legitimate reason may have come up that required that particular day, or they are being unreasonable.

OP, I understand that you are sad that you will miss the wedding, but you need not feel guilty.", "The \"why\" of how the wedding landed on the same day has lots of reasonable explanations.

I was of course sad she would not be with us, but I chose instead to not make it about me and instead celebrate with her and congratulate her in regards to her reason why. This bride could have done similar."]}
