Spaying also helps prevent pyometra. It\u2019s absolutely not something I would wish on anyone\u2019s pet. I waited to get my cat spayed because we had other pets with more pressing medical needs and she was an indoor cat with no chance of pregnancy. \n\nA week before she was finally scheduled she suddenly stopped moving. We rush her in and they tell us it\u2019s pyometra and she\u2019d need emergency surgery. We were lucky, it happened to be a surgery day at the vet, the vet had just finished the last spay, and the vet agreed to do it despite extremely low survival odds and it being something they wouldn\u2019t normally do (it was a low cost clinic that isn\u2019t fully equipped). Recovery was extremely rough. \n\nIf there had been a different vet or if it had been a different day or even a different time that day or if we had gone to a different vet office my cat would have died. \n\nI just wish when they push spaying to control animal populations that they\u2019d also talk about how important it is *medically*", "NTA.  As the man used to say, neuter and spay is the very best way.  It's not just ovarian cancer that's been prevented -- it's the risks that come with pregnancy, with male dogs going after the female, and all the potential illnesses that contact with other dogs like that can bring.  They're less aggressive, less prone to marking their territory, and less likely to run off chasing sex.", "NTA - As a former veterinary nurse, I wish more people were like you in this way. It's an ugly truth that animals left intact are open to a host of issues than a spayed/neutered one. If you don't plan on breeding, there's no point in keeping them intact. You don't want surprise puppies either.\n\nThere's no way to sugar coat it, and while I would have tried to be more tactful, you were already on the defensive - and rightly so. Not telling someone the truth, or not standing up for your opinions because they might trigger the other person is not responsible.\n\nEDIT a word and a sentence", "Nta. Dog hormones don\u2019t work like human hormones. As far as we know getting spayed doesn\u2019t carry big risks once the dog is grown and cleared by the vet plus it prevents overpopulation that has DEVASTATING consequences. And even if you\u2019re monitoring your dog for possible diseases related to reproductive system (which few people do regularly), it\u2019s imo a disservice to your pet to risk an emergency operation instead of a much less complicated and less risky planned one. Your friend should reflect of their choices related to pet health care.", "what kind of person is against spaying dogs? \n\nNTA", "NTA  -I mean if you spay your dog, then no ovaries and no ovarian cancer. No, your fault he hadn't joined the dots. Yes, there are risks to neutering any animal. But there are also risks to not neutering. (Edit: Your brother started the argument by accusing you of being a bad dog owner). \n\nSore point for me at the moment  as vets refusing to neuter ferrets in UK due to risk of adrenal disease (much lower incidence in UK than US) and ignoring all the consequences of having an entire or chemically neutered animal such as ovarian/uterine or testicular cancer, pyometria, anaemia, behaviourial issues and unwanted baby ferrets. No one can provide a risk odds table.", "NTA\n\nHe said some nasty things to you and you countered that with some facts that were hard to hear.\n\nHas Tim got other issues going on with him?  His reaction is very strong... I'm talking about the the lack of filter when he told you, you were cruel for the dog being spayed rather than his response to when you mentioned how his dog died....\n\nIt's nearly like it's okay for him to say hurtful things but he can't tolerate any retort even if he's in the wrong.\n\nThere also sounds like a bit of enablement going on if Clay commented on Tim's 'living in denial.'  Sounds like Tim needs some other support.", "The truth hurts.  NTA", "NTA. What you said is a fact and people who don\u2019t spay and neuter their pets for absolutely no good reason are the worst", "NTA, mate. There\u2019s a reason neutering and spaying programs for pets exist. \n\nBTW, what kind of dog do you have? Puppy tax please!", "Eh, soft YTA.\n\nYou could have stopped after saying that it prevents ovarian cancer.... That was enough of a hint since that's what his dog died of.", "The science simply isn't that clear-cut. Some studies have shown higher chances of joint problems / other cancers in neutered / spayed dogs. It depends on the breed, the timing, ...", "Def NTA, if you would've let him keep on living in denial he might cause another dog to suffer by doing the same thing to the poor animal.", "NTA he picked on u first by calling u cruel and in a way, u r hopefully preventing him making the same mistake for his next dog by not hiding the ugly truth.\n\nBut we need puppy tax here\u2026photo\u2026or soon everyone will YTA you\u2026doggo phoootooo \ud83d\ude02", "Honestly, YTA. \n\n While Spaying and Neutering is a good practice to help keep the unwanted animal population down (Every year 3.3 million dogs enter shelters and 670,000 are euthanized.)  There are far better ways to handle such a discussion.  Furthermore, without you being an actual vet, or vet tech, you can't specifically say whether or not removal of the organs would have prevented the cancer. Cancer can move, and just because it appears in one organ, doesn't always mean it metastasizes there. IE, it may not have started there.\n\nYou should have stopped with the simple statement of it being done by the shelter before you adopted your dog, and left it at that.  Everything after that point was completely, and utterly uncalled for.", "while spays and neuters are not ALWAYS necessary, they often are for the uneducated owner (like your brother). don\u2019t get an animal if you don\u2019t understand the pros and cons of both sides and timelines of that argument. un-neutered dogs have a risk of developing prostate issues later in life. un-spayed females are at risk of ovarian cancer, mammary tumors, and pyometra. your brother is dumb.

Similar situation where we had prioritised other vet costs before having her fixed. She started having brown spotting, which we took her to the vets to have diagnosed and they insisted it was just a urinary tract infection.In the meantime we kept booking to have her spayed and she kept going back into heat when the appointments came around so it kept getting pushed back.She kept spotting and developed a slight pot belly but seemed lively and normal.I did my own research and read about pyrometra, called the vets and they said absolutely not. Finally after a few frustrating appointments where they just gave her antibiotic injections for the \u201curinary infection\u201d I took her to a different vet who immediately listened took X-rays and urine samples and discovered a massive infection. She was kept overnight and had everything removed the next morning. It was such a huge and nasty infection that they took photos for there own records and said it was only the second cat they had ever treated for pyo. She had a funky haircut and a cone for awhile but recovered quite well. She has some lasting kidney issues after her infection unfortunately, it\u2019s something that we are keeping an eye on.", "Does pyometra affect dogs?

Like a LOT of people.  We have a horrendous stray animal problem because of it.  We also have no animal control.  Our local Humane Society pushes info about it but IMO they need to start putting out stuff correcting this misguided belief.  On top of that, while we do have a \"program\" for low income neutering, finding a vet that takes a voucher and doesnt tack on a bunch of fees is really hard.  It really sucks. \n\nThat's why I have so many cats.  People throw kittens in the field across from me and there's nothing I can do with them.  No place to take them but our \"pound\" which kills them the day they are brought in.  So I keep them.", "Way more people than there should be. I work in veterinary medicine in a somewhat rural area and the amount of people who are against vaccinations and spaying/neutering is shocking. And none of these people are educated.
