Spaying also helps prevent pyometra. It\u2019s absolutely not something I would wish on anyone\u2019s pet.

We rush her in and they tell us it\u2019s pyometra and she\u2019d need emergency surgery. We were lucky, it happened to be a surgery day at the vet, the vet had just finished the last spay, and the vet agreed to do it despite extremely low survival odds and it being something they wouldn\u2019t normally do (it was a low cost clinic that isn\u2019t fully equipped).

It's not just ovarian cancer that's been prevented -- it's the risks that come with pregnancy, with male dogs going after the female, and all the potential illnesses that contact with other dogs like that can bring.  They're less aggressive, less prone to marking their territory, and less likely to run off chasing sex.", "NTA - As a former veterinary nurse, I wish more people were like you in this way.

You don't want surprise puppies either.\n\nThere's no way to sugar coat it, and while I would have tried to be more tactful, you were already on the defensive - and rightly so.
