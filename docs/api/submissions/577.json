I[19F] have begged my parents for any pet, even a fish, all my life and never got one. So, I was incredibly excited when she brought home a (at the time) 1 year old corgi mix named Archie. While we were in the dorm, Archie stayed with her mom for the first 8 months. He was a normal, energetic and happy dog with a goofy smile and floppy ears. He was well socialized with other dogs and people. I promised her I would do anything she needed help with, walks, baths, I even footed some of the costs for toys/supplies. We took him to dog parks, hiking trails, everywhere. Then, Ashley\u2019s bf [20M] brought his pitty mix over to her house for a doggy play date. It was fine at first, then Archie went to sniff, and something changed. He was suddenly aggressive and kept trying to attack the pitty (she was very sweet and calm thankfully) Archie is neutered, but we found out later the girl dog was in heat. Thankfully, everyone made it out okay except Ashley and her bf got a few scratches. Fast forward, we got our own apartment and can\u2019t  take Archie to any of the places we used to, he tried to attack every person/dog he saw. I don\u2019t have experience with training dogs, so I took to YouTube and google. Positive reinforcement worked sometimes, but we weren\u2019t making progress. Ashley went to the vet, got some anti-anxiety pills and last month a vibration collar. Only now, he only behaves for Ashley/when the collar is on. He only acts up around men and bigger dogs, but it seems he\u2019s always acting on a fear response. Now yesterday, Ashley was sick in bed, so me and our third roommate, we\u2019ll call Sarah, took Archie for a late walk after his medication wore off (he\u2019s only been on it for a couple days) he had a major case of the zoomies but was otherwise normal. We took him to the fenced in dog park and he started acting aggressively toward a person walking passed, I gave him the command to stop, he didn\u2019t, I went to leash him and go home and he attacked me. He didn\u2019t draw blood, but I was pretty beat up and had a few bite marks. We went home and told Ashley, and she gave the usual spell of \u201che came from an abusive home, it\u2019s the new medication, it\u2019s your fault for not putting the collar on, etc.\u201d I told her I understand, but don\u2019t feel safe walking him myself anymore until she fixes his behavior, Ashley said I\u2019m going back on my word. Sarah says I had an angry tone last night and now Ashley won\u2019t talk to me.

This is a dangerous situation that will keep getting more dangerous.\n\nThis dog needs professional training.  Not looking some things up on yt.  If this dog is a rescue with a background, it is probably too much for a first time dog owner", "NTA!!!  This dog has major behavioral issues that need to be taken care of and if your safety is at risk, then pupper sitting is a no go!  Imagine walking the dog and it sees a man walking with his child and it gets away from you...thus attacking the man with his child who gets mauled.  You'd be responsible!  Your roommate needs to do more than youtube a few dog tricks.  A behaviorist and some serious training is necessary.", "NTA\n\nThe situation has changed therefor the agreement needs to change. \n\nShe needs to hire a behaviorist.", "NTA but your roommate is. Anyone who has a pet and doesn\u2019t take proper care of it doesn\u2019t deserve to keep it you should report her", "NTA.\n\nThis dog ATTACKED YOU. \n\nYour roommate is very lucky you didn't need to go to hospital. Dog bites are taken very seriously.\n\nAnd I hate people who try to anthropomorphize  why a dog is behaving that way...he came from an abusive home... didn't he stay with her MOM for the first 8 months???\n\nSo, the behavior needs to be addressed by a professional and professional training. If you are going to be taking this dog out, you NEED to know how to use the tools.\n\nFrankly, this dog shouldn't be trusted off leash. He is aggressive and it sounds like neither of you are equipped to handle it.", "NTA\n\nThe dog isn't safe to be around and she needs to see this. He attacked you!! How is she okay with this? She needs to get that dog to a specialist before he does serious damage to someone and she's in a heap of legal trouble for it. Doesn't she realize what could happen?\n\nAlso, this dog should not be in an off leash dog part at all. He is too unstable and so many things could go wrong here.", "NTA. If you choose to bring a dog into your life ultimately it is your responsibility to ensure that the dog has a good life. Correcting negative behaviors is a huge part of assuring a good quality of life for the dog. Even if the dog hadn't attacked you, you had every right to not take care of it BECAUSE IT IS NOT YOUR DOG and any offer to take care of it is a favor you were willing to do. Given these circumstances, you are certainly entitled to no longer do favors for the roommate or the dog, and if your roommate is too cheap or lazy to properly retrain this dog she doesn't deserve to keep the dog.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHe dog attacked you? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy did you not make a police report, and demand that the dog is removed out of your home?", "NAH - The dog needs serious training by a behaviorist, and that means the whole household needs to learn how to handle that training. He also needs to be allowed nowhere near a dog park and never be allowed unleashed in public anymore. So far as walking him in the future, that's a conversation to have with your roommate, but keep in mind that if she's not able to walk him due to illness, injury, or what have you, that means that if you won't even take him out, you're risking accidents in the house.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Quite honestly you wouldn't be the asshole even if you didn't want to live with an aggressive dog.", "NTA\n\nWhat happens if he becomes uncontrollable and  bites someone while in your care; who's responsible, you or dog owner?", "This has happened as well, but it was when she and \u201cSarah\u201d were walking him and another dog was off leash, she just picked Archie up and carried him away, looking back I don\u2019t think she saw the severity of it then either. Thank you so much for the response!", "Yeah, he was in an abusive home before he was returned to the shelter, where she adopted him. I totally agree that I have no idea how to train a dog, but professional training can be very expensive for three college students. I don\u2019t really know why she still refers to his previous owners, because he was perfectly behaved at her moms house. I feel like maybe he should\u2019ve stayed there. Thank you for your input!", "As selfish as this sounds I do love him too, I just wish my roommate would see the severity of the situation and train him. Archie is/was such a sweet dog and I would hate to lose him.", "I'll never understand people who don't train their pets.  Especially aggressive ones!  Tell her that over time the dog has gotten more aggressive and since there has been a lack of training, then you cannot comfortably help care for the pup.  It sucks, but your face is just too pretty for bite marks!", "You're welcome.\n\nDid your roommate ever apologize to you for the attack?\n\nI also think that dog shouldn't live there.\n\nThe best thing for the dog would be rehoming so he could get the help he needs (if he can be helped).", "You are as irresponsible as your roommate - a dog that is attacking people is not a pet for incompetent pet-owners. rehome him fast, or bring him to the shelter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOU and your roommate are responsible when someone else gets hurt, maybe worse. And if YOU are the one walking him while he attacks someone, YOU will face a huge liability that will financially ruin you, and maybe send you to prison. Because you KNOW the dog was dangerous and has a history of attacking people, and STILL are not doing anything to protect people. That's gross negligence at minimum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince you do not care for others, that at least should make you think ablout your own future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe two of you are major AH, change it to ESH.", " She did, and said that he probably didn\u2019t mean it and might\u2019ve thought I was a stranger, which makes sense to me.", "You have a good point. If it was my dog I probably would\u2019ve done what a lot of these comments are suggesting, but I can\u2019t take him to a behavioral specialist because he isn\u2019t my dog, and I hope refusing to take him out myself will help protect others. You definitely are right in I should\u2019ve done something sooner, thank you.", "Um, no. That reason doesn't fly. HE ATTACKED YOU.  The next time that dog attacks someone, is that going to be the response? \"He didn't mean it\"? \n\nFrom your explanation, it sounds like the behavior is escalating.\n\nAt the risk of being extreme, what if the dog attacked a kid at the dog park? \n\nAdmittedly, neither of you are dog trainers and can't afford a professional.\n\nThere is absolutely no shame in saying that this dog is beyond you. Love isn't always enough, unfortunately. But admitting that is actually love.", "You definitely have a point, thanks so much! I\u2019ll try to talk to her in a bit, as this scenario just happened yesterday, but once again thank you, I feel like extremes are kind of needed in this situation, and I\u2019ll definitely be using that last line!"]}
