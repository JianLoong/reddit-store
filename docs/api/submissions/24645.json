She(25) Jill, is huge on alternative medicines and holistic mumbo-jumbo. She won\u2019t even take aspirin and refuses to wear normal deodorant.\nOne of the things she does is put halved onions in the bathroom, as she believes they trap odors and absorb toxins in the air. Sometimes she will even put them in her socks at night while she sleeps. Her general odor and onion practices weren\u2019t a problem back when the two of them had their own place but their apartment flooded so they\u2019ve been staying with me for a while.\n\n\nMy house is a two bedroom which only has one bathroom. Never thought the *one bathroom thing* would be an issue. Boy was I wrong. Jill has laid an onion siege on the bathroom. There\u2019s one on top of the toilet, in the shower, by the sink, and she mentioned putting one in the towel cabinet too.\n\n\nI\u2019ve tried talking to Jack about it and all he said was \u201cyou get used to it, it\u2019s good for your health\u201d. \nHe doesn\u2019t even like onions!\n\n\nI\u2019ve Jill to stop the onion invasion to which she would say something about how \u201cit\u2019s a spiritual thing\u201d or \u201cit doesn\u2019t feel clean to breathe in the house without them\u201d. I even offered to purchase an air purifier, but no dice. I\u2019ve tried throwing them away a but then she would pitch a wobbly and go buy, cut, and replace them. Aside from being gross and weird it\u2019s also expensive and wasteful.\n\n\nFast forward to last Thursday. I had just gotten off work. Jack and Jill were watching a movie in the living room. I decided to make burgers. Went grocery shopping the day before so we were fully stocked. \n\n\nOr so I thought. When I went to grab an onion for the burgers I saw all my onions were gone. That\u2019s when I noticed, the coffee table, book shelf, TV stand, and kitchen table all had cut onions on them!\n\n\nI was livid, about to start yelling, but then I had an idea. I went to the bathroom and grabbed the toilet onion. I cut them up and placed them on her burger and watched as she took a bite. She ate almost the whole thing before she left to use the bathroom, dropping the plate off in the kitchen on the way.\n\n\nJill stepped out of the bathroom and politely asked where the toilet onion was. I didn\u2019t say anything. I just gestured over to the nearly finished burger on her plate. I can\u2019t tell you the shock that spread across her face. She started crying and screaming \u201cyou made me eat POOP ONIONS?! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?\u201d\n\n\nJack came around the corner to see what was going on and upon hearing what I did told me that I\u2019m an asshole and that I went too far. He took her to their bedroom so she could calm down then without saying another word to me they both left with some clothes.\n\n\nThey stayed at a friends place till Sunday morning when they came home.

So I\u2019m going to say ESH because your future DIL is basically stealing from you every time she leaves your cut up onions everywhere, not to mention it\u2019s your house and she needs to respect that you don\u2019t want onions everywhere, your son because he\u2019s not enforcing that it\u2019s not their house and she can\u2019t have onions everywhere, and you because, justified as I feel your actions are, you still went a bit too far in feeding someone the probably contaminated onions.", "NTA", "NTA that's hilarious well played \ud83d\ude02", "ESH While your revenge is funny, all it's going to do is escalate hostility not solve the problem.

Am I to understand she doesn't approve of your brand of seasoning? Don't get more organic than that. Joking aside.. that was a bit far.

Do you have any idea how many poo particles float around the bathroom after you go??? This is beyond disgusting. Wtf is wrong with you?!?\n\nShe may have her issues, I won\u2019t disagree with you there, but you never, *ever* eat food that has been sitting in the bathroom.", "YTA because honestly fecal matter does float through the air when you flush a toilet. It\u2019s why the lid closes. That was nasty. However they (your son and his girlfriend) are the ass for moving in and not respecting your wishes! And now coming back and refusing to speak to you.", "Lol. Definitely NTA. She used food you had bought for her nonsense, so you paid her back in kind.

It's your home not theirs.\nThey need to show respect.", "You may be the asshole but you're also damn hilarious and I salute you!", "Wait OP you may be going about this from the wrong angle. Tell the GF that you thought since she re-purposed the onion first, you were just trying to follow suit by being eco-friendly.

There's absolutely no reason for her to have chopped onions all over YOUR house. Not only is it useless and wasteful, it's stinky. If she wants to put out onions in her own home, fine. This is not her home and she's acting entitled to do whatever she wants there. That's not ok. She used the onions YOU bought and you had enough of the bs. Jill sounds like an anti-science moron and I can't deal with those. You're being very nice for allowing them to stay with you and she should be more respectful of your space. You asked her to stop with the onions and asking once should have been enough for her to stop. You don't get to make your own rules in somebody else's home.

I'm torn.\n\nAs a home cook I am offended by you giving tainted food to a guest.\n\nAs a person with a nose who doesn't want my whole house to smell like onions, I can agree with taking some drastic action.  I think an ultimatum \"you can throw out the onions or you can leave\" would have been better.", "yall got 0 social skills wtf. No do not feed someone food that's been in a bathroom for several days, that borders on child abuse feeding fecal matter to someone. On the other hand man up and tell them it's your house and to stop putting onions everywhere.", "YTA\n\nMight have been N T A or E S H if you used different onions for the food and hid the toilet onions to make her think she ate poop onions but you did something that could make her actually sick when she was trying to help your home, albeit in a completely BS way.

At least it wasn't with an Iranian yoghurt dressing!", "OP needs their own Reddit sub and blog dedicated to the Onion Chronicles.

It's hugely disrespectful. OP's pretty much lost their son to the fruit loop onion idol worshipper, to be honest.
