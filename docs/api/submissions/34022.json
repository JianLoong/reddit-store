{"id": 34022, "submission_id": "18uaof1", "title": "AITA for telling my Mom I wished she died instead of my Dad", "selftext": "I (51f) am the second youngest child of 8. Growing up there was a constant unfairness and favoritism between my siblings from my parents. My sister \u201cCathy\u201d, who I am 18 months apart from, and I would always get the short end of the stick when we were younger. Cathy and I got pulled out of private school and put into public high school so my parents could pay for my older sister\u2019s university. In high school, I participated in many things like ASB and swimming, but my parents never showed up for anything or give us rides to school so we had to walk. When it came time for applying to college, my parents only gave Cathy and I two options: community college or a university that my two older brothers went to. \n\nIn 2015, my dad (82m) was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. When his condition got worse in 2016, I would visit daily. He passed away in late May of 2016. After he passed, the favoritism from my mom got even worse since my dad would normally mitigate it. \n\nFast forward to 2021, my mom (83f) began planning on how her possessions would be dispersed after she passes. She called all of the siblings up to her house so that we could make lists and plan on who received what. Many people wrote lengthy lists that she promised they would receive. I wanted a few sentimental items, photos of my parents, and a specific ring that my mother owns called the \u2018mother\u2019s ring\u2019 that has the birthstones of all of her children. When I gave her my list, she told me that if I wanted the ring, it would be the only thing I would inherit, and beforehand she would remove it\u2019s stones and give them to other siblings. This sparked an emotional argument, as I asked for much less than other people, and she said I didn\u2019t deserve more. We started bringing up things from the past, with me mentioning how she mistreated me, and she completely blew me off. I then tearfully told her I wished she had died instead of our father, because he would have treated his children much more fairly in this situation. This hurt her greatly because she has never recovered from the loss of her husband, and despite her behavior she does love all of her children.\n\nAfter this happened, our relationship was never the same. We didn\u2019t speak for many months and every time I would see her, I would only say hello and goodbye. She hasn\u2019t apologized for what she has done in the past or about the mother\u2019s ring. I do feel like what I said was harsh but I won\u2019t apologize for it since I think someone needed to give her a reality check for how bad she has treated some of the siblings and it was a moment of pent up resentment I held down for many years. \n\nEven now, my mom\u2019s plan is to only give me the mother\u2019s ring with no stones in it and nothing else. \n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1703923666, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18uaof1/aita_for_telling_my_mom_i_wished_she_died_instead/", "score": 769, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sometimes the relationship isn't worth saving and people are not worthy of respect. It can be difficult, especially if they seem like a different person around other siblings or people, but you know your story.You know your history and sometimes if a person in your life is causing you pain or anxiety you simply need to cut them off. Going no contact is difficult especially if you yourself are dutiful and traditional and honorable but the person that you are dealing with needs to earn your respect they need to be worthy of your love and reciprocate it. That's not the case here. Is a ring worth your self respect? This person takes perverse joy in needling you and you're never going to get an acknowledgement of wrongdoing or apology that satisfies you. Your mother has rationalized her position and her actions to a point where you are not going to make her see life from your perspective. Get good with that.

Finally when I was in my 30s we got into an argument and I just unloaded all my emotional pain that I had been holding onto for years.

Look, I get how bad it sucks. I'm the less-favored one in my family, and it took years to stop resenting both my brother and mother for it. But neither of them are going to change, so I can either hang on to all that pain and anger and let it wreck any relationship I might have, or I can accept whatever's offered. You mentioned that your mother loves all her children, and I can understand that. My mother does love me in her own way, and if it's not the way I might prefer to be loved, that's not either of our fault. If you care about your mom at all, then you should seriously consider reaching out to make amends. She's not going to be here all that much longer, after all.

Random question : Is there a specific reason she doesn't want you to have the stones& thinks you don't deserve them  ? Like, does she plan to remove the stones just so  you each have your respective stones ? Or is there a history of you pawning or selling anything of importance? Have you done some bad things in the past that made her lose her trust in you? You don't have to answer and it won't change mine, I'm just trying to get an understanding of why she said you don't deserve them .

Make sure all is documented well.\n\nAnd then contest the will after she passed. Make sure you get the legal share.\n\n\nWhat do your siblings say about all of this?

And even in death?", "I mean technically I have to say ESH but it's NTA in my heart.\n\nI think you were still hoping for the mythical \"closure\". That one day you would say a magical combination of words where it would click for her how awful she was and she would give a meaningful apology and try to give you as much love as possible to make up for the decades she withheld it.\n\nUnfortunately that is so rare we may as well say it never happens. It's harsh but you won't get closure from her and she won't make anything right with the inheritance. Admitting she did anything wrong is likely too psychologically difficult for her so she doubles down that she was right instead.\n\nYour energy would be better spent finding a way to be at peace without her giving you that closure or any inheritance.\n\nIf anything I'd be telling her destroying she ring isn't worth it to just for a last opportunity to mistreat you and she should leave it intact and give it to one of her favourites instead.\n\nI'd find the empty ring too painful.", "ESH. Obviously the life time of favouritism is not ok. \n\nI\u2019m going to be an outlier here and say that I don\u2019t see anything wrong with her removing the stones if each of the stones were intended to go to each child they represented. The way she said that you don\u2019t \u2018deserve\u2019 more was cruel though. If that was her intended plan for the ring then it would be kind to give you something else given your siblings would all be getting other things. \n\nWhile I understand you being upset, especially given the history, it would be very hurtful to be told that your child wished you were dead.", "Ugh. Did anyone else want the same sentimental items? Do you want them more than the ring? Parents sometimes can be weird about inherited jewelry; it\u2019s one of the items with a higher $ value. If one kid is asking for a whole pile of stuff but it\u2019s not really worth anything and another \u201cjust\u201d wants a single item but it\u2019s worth a significant amount it makes sense that it might be in a class by itself. If you only want the ring if intact, I\u2019d tell your mom you don\u2019t want it under those conditions.\n\nAlso: you don\u2019t need to wait until your mom passes to get photos of your parents. Ask to borrow now and make a copy. \n\nInheritance stuff sucks - often destroys families. It helps to remember that it\u2019s just \u201cstuff\u201d, you aren\u2019t \u201cowed\u201d anything (even if others get something!) and relationships are more important. I think in your case it\u2019s the symbolism behind it that hurts. You felt overlooked as a child and you feel overlooked now during estate planning. You can\u2019t change the past, nor can you change how someone else behaves so you should focus on your own behaviour (which you can control!). Accept that she isn\u2019t the mother you wish she was. I think you should let go of the scorecard. Sometimes parents have to make choices about how we spend our money and time that seem \u201cunfair\u201d on the face of things. Sometimes we screw up, but sometimes we have different priorities that don\u2019t revolve around the one kid. Especially if you are a child and comparing yourself to your siblings. You don\u2019t mention whether you had to pay your own way for university or not, but it\u2019s implied you didn\u2019t. And you do say you participated in many extra curriculars which are not cheap. \n\nWould it have been nice to have your parents go to your events? Yes. Do any of the other things strike me as egregious errors and examples of favouritism? Um no. Especially the rides thing. You poor thing, having to walk instead of getting a ride!!! (/s)\n\nMy son complains sometimes about rides too. His sister does some activities where she needs a ride. Meanwhile, his activities are a short walk away. He hates walking home in the dark, so thinks that he should get a ride because \u201cit\u2019s not fair\u201d his sister gets a ride and he doesn\u2019t. Honestly - the fact that he is focussed on the fairness to his sister is completely self centered. She spends a significant portion of her life being active. He prefers non active leisure. He needs the walk, giving him a ride every time would make our schedule that much worse and it\u2019s an expenditure for no real reason. The fact that he could walk is the main reason he was allowed to participate in the activity. It\u2019s not really \u201cfair\u201d that we have to sacrifice our time and money to drive our eldest to this activity either. We choose to do it to enable her to go to the activity. Son could choose to not do activity at all, but he wants us to choose to spend extra time and money because he\u2019s using that as some kind of proof that we love him as much. All the other things we do don\u2019t count, because his sister doesn\u2019t come out ahead. It\u2019s a super unhealthy and toxic way of living.  \n\nUltimately in our case we decided that the reasons to rely on walking as transport far far outweigh his feelings that he shouldn\u2019t because his sister - in completely different circumstances - couldn\u2019t. We\u2019re working on the underlying issue.\n\n I bet if you asked your mom why your parents decided that you should walk she could give reasons why. Perhaps they did prioritize what was best for the family overall rather than what was best for you personally, but even if that\u2019s true - it doesn\u2019t really matter! To me it does sound like you still had a privileged life. You got some private schooling, until it was judged that the additional benefit your sister would get from her university outweighed the additional benefit you got from private school. You did many extra curriculars. Your parents paid for your post secondary and even gave you choices about where to go. You are unhappy about this because you are focussed on what you didn\u2019t get rather than what you did. Life IS unfair. You\u2019ll be a LOT happier if you can let go of your parents\u2019 failings and count your blessings instead.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty harsh to wish death on someone especially to their face. You said that because you wanted to hurt your mom; no matter how she\u2019s treated you - YTA, even if justified, and you should apologize.\n\nTLDR; I\u2019m not convinced you are assessing the favoritism accurately but even if you are, you\u2019ll be happier if you let go of the scorecard. Get a copy of the photos, decide whether you want the ring or the other stuff more, apologize for wishing your mom dead to her face and count your blessings.", "NTA. Treat others how you wish to be treated. Your mother has your entire life showed you that she loves the golden child more than you.

Instead, let everyone wonder why one of her daughters thought so little of her that she chose not to honor her in death.\n\nYou cannot control how she treats you, alive or in death,. However, you can control how you react to her.

That your mom insists in giving you the ring without the stones makes her an AH I think, although I would be curious about how much history happened there and what she means by \u201cyou don\u2019t deserve the stones\u201d; I\u2019m wondering if OP is leaving parts of the story out and how all of that would sound from her perspective.\n\nThe statement about wishing she had died makes OP an AH, no question; and additionally some of OPs \u201cchildhood complaints\u201d sounded quite entitled to me (having had to leave private school to go to public school so that another sibling could study). \n\nWell, money does not grow on trees; many or most kids never get to go to private school to begin with and if a family has to decide to pay a university degree worth of money just for a K to 12 school, then 100% there is more value in putting that same money into a university degree instead of private school. Did they pay for university for you afterwards OP?", "I mean everybody seems pretty much to think that you're nta but I don't really get it. You went to your elderly mom and asked if you could specifically inherit what is probably one of her most high value items that is supposed to be representative of all eight of you siblings. It makes perfect sense why she would give your siblings the birthstone that represents them from the ring. I can understand why that might be upsetting because I'm sure the ring is less valuable that way. However, that doesn't make it an unfair decision. \n\nI'm also not really understanding the allegations of favoritism. Your parents had eight children. I'm sure as time went on they had less money to spread across all eight of your educations. And I'm sure they didn't plan at all entirely in advance. But by your own account they were still able to afford to pay for a portion of your higher education.\n\nSo to me that combined with the fact that you insulted your mom because you might not be getting the inheritance that you want when she has at least seven other people whose inheritance she has to sort out seems really entitled.

When it came time for applying to college, my parents only gave Cathy and I two options: community college or a university that my two older brothers went to. \n\nIn 2015, my dad (82m) was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. When his condition got worse in 2016, I would visit daily. He passed away in late May of 2016. After he passed, the favoritism from my mom got even worse since my dad would normally mitigate it. \n\nFast forward to 2021, my mom (83f) began planning on how her possessions would be dispersed after she passes. She called all of the siblings up to her house so that we could make lists and plan on who received what. Many people wrote lengthy lists that she promised they would receive. I wanted a few sentimental items, photos of my parents, and a specific ring that my mother owns called the \u2018mother\u2019s ring\u2019 that has the birthstones of all of her children. When I gave her my list, she told me that if I wanted the ring, it would be the only thing I would inherit, and beforehand she would remove it\u2019s stones and give them to other siblings. This sparked an emotional argument, as I asked for much less than other people, and she said I didn\u2019t deserve more. We started bringing up things from the past, with me mentioning how she mistreated me, and she completely blew me off. I then tearfully told her I wished she had died instead of our father, because he would have treated his children much more fairly in this situation. This hurt her greatly because she has never recovered from the loss of her husband, and despite her behavior she does love all of her children.\n\nAfter this happened, our relationship was never the same. We didn\u2019t speak for many months and every time I would see her, I would only say hello and goodbye. She hasn\u2019t apologized for what she has done in the past or about the mother\u2019s ring. I do feel like what I said was harsh but I won\u2019t apologize for it since I think someone needed to give her a reality check for how bad she has treated some of the siblings and it was a moment of pent up resentment I held down for many years. \n\nEven now, my mom\u2019s plan is to only give me the mother\u2019s ring with no stones in it and nothing else. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Bringing this up thirty-plus years later is an entirely futile endeavour.\n\nYes, your mother gets to leave her possessions how she wants.

You for saying something pretty heinous even if it was during an emotionally charged moment; your mother (and let's be honest, your dad, too) for having more kids than they could reasonably afford to give the same quality of life. Look, I get it--your parents were raising kids in the 60s and 70s. It was a different time, and your parents' parenting style no doubt changed over the course of 8 kids. The mom your oldest siblings got is not the mom you got. The childhood they had isn't the one you had--this is what happens when parents either have a lot of kids, or there's a huge gap between kids. I'm not saying it's right, it's just what happens, especially to people who were members of Gen X, which it sounds like you are. Their parents were already kind of checked out and emotionally negligent; I can only imagine what having 8 kids would do. \n\nThat being said, while your anger and emotions are justified, telling someone you wish they'd died instead of their partner who did is really cruel. From what you described, I don't think your parents were intentionally unfair to you and your sister--they were probably just burned out and tapped out financially after so many kids. I don't know what your parents did for work, but the 70s and 80s weren't great economic times, so presumably, by the time you were ready for college, they might not have had any money due to economic investments that didn't pan out.  I mean, I think it's nice that your parents were willing to pay for all 8 kids to go to college in the first place, community or otherwise. I realize it may have had strings attached, but it's more than a lot of others got. It's possible they had some kind of alumni deal with the university your brothers went to. Again, I'm presuming and giving the benefit of the doubt, so feel free to correct. \n\nBottom line is, even though your mom was in the wrong when it came to dividing up inheritance, you lost the upper hand when you wished her dead.", "Where did you come up with this?

She\u2019d still be getting \u201cmore\u201d jewelry than her siblings.", "Say yes. Melt the ring down and turn it into something which symbolizes your healing", "Agree with this, but I want to add that the process of dividing up inheritance based on wish lists from the kids individually sounds like a horrible idea. Guaranteed to create conflict and unfair shares. \n\nIf OP has a good relationship with the other siblings maybe they can pull together and piece the ring back together if the mother goes through with the absurd disassembly of it.", "I really hope OP sees this. And I would recommend therapy as well. You'd think OP would have learned life isn't fair by 51 but I guess not. You mentioned money management between siblings but I think retirement is also important to remember here. By the time OP was heading to college the parents were probably much more focused on saving for retirement than they were with the older kids. That in itself is another gift to OP whether she realizes it or not. \n\nIf you have to choose between funding your child's dream school and saving for retirement, pick retirement! Having funds to carry you through your old age will make things a hell of a lot easier on your kids in the future. And the parents still get bonus points for offering to pay for the schools they *could* afford.", "Agree wholeheartedly. NTA. Is a stone-less ring really worth remaining in contact with someone who doesn't value you? I know this is about you and your mother, but I'm curious if your golden siblings stand up for fairness or just go along eith the favoritism?

They sound like two people making tough decisions while trying to parent 8 kids. I get it sucks but there isn't an infinite amount of money to go around. If I had to choose between paying for one child's university and the other's private school, I'd choose university too. Private school isn't necessary to get into a college so it's an unnecessary expense. And I get it sucks that the parents only gave them a couple colleges to choose from for their higher education, but they were still offering to pay and they didn't have to. So much of this sounds like \"you're a bad parent for gifting me what you could instead of exactly what I wanted.\" That's not really fair.", ">Bottom line is, even though your mom was in the wrong when it came to dividing up inheritance\n\nMom wasn't even wrong for that.

They both treated me quite cruelly when I was young and both were encouraged to do so by my mother.  Also my 2 sisters fleeced my mother out of $400,000 through various schemes. I warned my mother about it in the 1970s but she didn\u2019t believe me. I then told her she could do whatever she wants with her money since it\u2019s not mine.

That sounds good too", "Back in the day (1980s) it was rather popular to have a jeweler melt down unwanted gold jewelry into \u201cnugget\u201d pendants.

But you can't go back and change it, so *let it go*.\n\nI suspect the ring OP wants is probably pretty valuable, and that may be why her mother is saying if she wants to be left that, that's the only thing you'll get. But even if her mom was showing favoritism in distribution of her personal possessions to her kids,  that is one aspect of a will where I think people get to make personal decisions that may seem unfair - you can't hack a favorite table or chair in two and give half, some**one**'s got to get it, and that means no one else can, so. This isn't like leaving savings or shares or a family home, which should be split evenly between all kids - this is *things.*", "I didn't necessarily mean she was wrong for dividing it up, just in how she went about it; I think asking people what they want beforehand is just asking for trouble, personally.", "Thank you for the response.
