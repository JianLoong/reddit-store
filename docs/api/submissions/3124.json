Right now it's bday gifts, later a place to stay, financial support, be their retirement plan.\n\n\nThey don't deserve you.", "Totally NTA you should told your parents \"I guess you don't love me since you stopped give presents when I was 10\"\n\nDon't feel bad for ruinng 1 day for your brother when the torture you since your born", "YOU ARE NOT THE ASSHOLE. \nThey have abused you for years and now that you are standing up for yourself they call you an Ah ? Fuck them and go nc", "You should use their logic right back at them and say you're too old to give gifts to family, don't ever expect anything from me again. Edit forgot the NTA.", "NTA and the perfect comeback was \u201cgood to know none of the assholes in my family love me... when you went out to dinner without on me on my birthday!\u201d Tell your family to frack off and never contact you again. Your life will be better without their toxic bs in it. You deserve better & need to work on your self worth.", "NTA. You should have replied their \"you don't do that to the people you love\" with *That's correct. So draw your own conclusion.*", "NTA --- I completely understand that I come from a family where my sister and step-brother got everything and could do no wrong haven't spoken to my mother in at least 20 years and I don't miss her one little bit.", "NTA.  Since they have made zero effort to treat you as a family member, why should you extend the courtesy to them?  Have as little contact or interaction with them as you wish.  You are in no way obligated to partake with anyone who is toxic, your family included.", "NTA\n\nYou treated your brother's birthday the exact way everyone else in your family treated yours.  \n\nCut them all off.  And if they come to your home again, don't open the door.", "Nta, I\u2019m so sorry you have go through this!", "NTA cut them out of your life no one is ever allowed to treat you like this your better of without them If you have the ability move away and never look back \n\nYou deserve better", "Your parents called you an ah for doing to your brothers what they did to you do they have no self awareness? They said you don't do this to people you love but they do it to you this should tell you everything you need to know.\nThey sound like horrible people and fact you tried to make it work even after everything shows you are much better person. I hope despite how hard it may be you do go NC and stay that way as I have a feeling will be best thing you ever do and your life will improve vastly. \nYou need to know you're worth so much more than they want you to think you are so stay strong and I hope you find a wonderful chosen family that see how great you are", "Well first of all: happy belated birthday OP! I really hope you treated yourself to a nice dinner and got yourself a present.\n\nSecondly, NTA. Ignore your shitty \u201cparents\u201d, although I have a hard time calling then that. To be honest, some people shouldn\u2019t have kids because they don\u2019t love them in the way that every child deserves to be loved.\n\nYou deserve to be loved and appreciated OP. Wanted. Cared for. They haven\u2019t done that for you your whole life and for that I am sorry.\n\nFocus on yourself and the people who do care about you, because I promise you are worthy of love and belonging.", "NTA. And the proper response to your parents would have been: \u201cyou are right. You don\u2019t do that to people you love. What does this tell you?\u201c and than shut the door in their faces", "They went out for your birthday and didn't include you? What? How? (And what again!!)\n\nHave you thought about getting another job in another city and simply starting over?'\n\nOf course, you're NTA, but that doesn't really matter in the big picture here. Their treatment of you has made lasting damage and since nobody else cares about your wellbeing, you need to care extra about yourself and set yourself up for success. \n\nCongratulations on your birthday all the way from Denmark! I hope you get to create your own family and include people, who love you in your circle.", "So they told you they pick you up and went to eat without you didn't even call you to come ? How did you found out about it ?\n\nFamily means nothing when the ppl in it are toxic . It sucks when ppl tell you you owe your family respect but you don't owe them shit when they treat you like shit", "\"You domt do that to people you love\" so they are admitting they don't love you then?", "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been made to feel that way. Based off the info solely in the post, protect your boundaries and your peace. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole, you\u2019re just done. I understand the guilt factor, I think society and the way generations past have raised generations present have engraved that idea in us. Kind of like the whole \u201cblood over water\u201d thing. Seems like you\u2019ve tried to voice your feelings and we\u2019re ignored, more on the gas lighted side really.
