And maybe that kid usually gets the shorter end of the stick.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry you were treated this way. I understand as my mom never treated me or my older brother the same as the other siblings. The only suggestion I have for you is when they do things like this in the future tell them you will now be treating your other family members the way they treat you. When it is another family member\u2019s birthday invite friends to go out to dinner. And let them know they will not be showing up on your doorstep to tell you what a piece of crap you are and if they do you will call the police and have them removed. You deserve much more than this and if they are not willing to adjust their way of thinking then you need to cut them out. Family members, like spouses, do not deserve to be abused. :", "Way too late, but NTA.\n\nThey are hypocrites. They expect something from you that they aren't willing to return. When they said \"you don't do that to the people you love\", they implicitly told you they don't love you because they pretty much treated you the same way if not worse.\n\nYou're a punching bag for them at best and an easy victim they can abuse to make themselves feel better it seems. They don't deserve any of your time, care or attention. I recommend blocking their numbers and moving on. They're not good for you and you owe them nothing.", "NTA,  feel no guilt.  They are not for you. You can and should fill your world with people who add joy to your life.  Walk away. Lose their contact info, live your own life with purpose and love.", "Please go complete NC, the best revenge is a life well lived. You will never have the family you truly want and it's time to let go completely. They will never give you the love and affection you crave and will only.keep hurting yourself", "NTA. It seems like ur only welcome when they want something from u, but when want any form of affection ur selfish.  Ditch them, they aren't worth it.", "NTA- You should not feel like an AH. They didn't care for your birthday but your brother's birthday matters? You realise that they want to be treated as a priority while you are not even an option for them. \n\nI don't know how they feel about you but I don't think they love or care for you as much as you do. You need to stop feeling guilty because self preservation and self love is important. Its not selfish. Stop putting them and their feelings over yours. Talk to your friends or a therapist. Clear your head, live for yourself. Surround yourself with people who will love you \n\nLove yourself because your family clearly doesn't.", "NTA why talk to people who treat you bad? Why care about people who treat you bad? It's obvious that the only reason you have any connection is because of blood ties. And that's not enough, to be made to feel bad. You're much more important than that. You're entitled to more then that from the people in your life. Good job OP for seeing the issue and moving forward. Do please check out therapy/counseling for additional help to unpack these kinds of family abuse. That way you don't carry it over to friendships/romantic partners. Continue to make healthy choices.", "> but im some years from give them the benefit of doubt\n\nNope fuck that, they can live with the consequences of their own actions"]}
