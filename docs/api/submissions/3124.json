Start practicing having confidence in yourself and your opinions of your family relationships.

If they start blaming, yelling, guilt tripping then firmly and politely end the conversation.  It\u2019s to your benefit to maintain whatever level of connection you can with your family so just start saying no when you need to and reduce your contact with them gradually until you find a level of contact that you can live with.
