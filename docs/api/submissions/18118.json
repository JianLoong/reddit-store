No harm in pointing that out", "NTA. When my sister died a friend suggested a memorial tattoo. I laughed because my sister *despised* tattoos, why would I memorialize her that way?

You are probably right that he won\u2019t like it and you are kinda giving your sister a chance to remove the tattoo before your dad sees it.", "NTA.   \nIt\u2019s obviously a stupid way to honour your father.", "NTA, if she really expects him to be happy about this \"appreciation\" she needs to have her expectations taken down a few notches!", "YTA.  Why do you need to put your opinion in when it doesn't appear that she asked for it?  She wanted to do something to honor your dad.  It sounds like a really thoughtful gesture.  What are you doing to honor your dad?", "INFO: Was this the first you had heard of the tattoo or did she tell you she was doing it in advance?", "YTA. \n\nIt may be a strange idea, but it was obviously important to her and she didn\u2019t ask for your input so you should have kept your opinions to yourself.", "YTA but not that bad cause you guys are siblings", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
