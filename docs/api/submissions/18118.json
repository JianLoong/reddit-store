No harm in pointing that out", "NTA. When my sister died a friend suggested a memorial tattoo. I laughed because my sister *despised* tattoos, why would I memorialize her that way? And she wasn't even around to see it.", "NTA.\n\nYour dad hates tattoos and your sister in turn, gets a tattoo about your dad. You are probably right that he won\u2019t like it and you are kinda giving your sister a chance to remove the tattoo before your dad sees it.", "NTA.   \nIt\u2019s obviously a stupid way to honour your father.", "NTA, if she really expects him to be happy about this \"appreciation\" she needs to have her expectations taken down a few notches!", "YTA.  Why do you need to put your opinion in when it doesn't appear that she asked for it?  She wanted to do something to honor your dad.  It sounds like a really thoughtful gesture.

She\u2019s probably just defensive because she knows you\u2019re right.", "She is pulling what my oldest pulled on me. I would not allow my daughter to get a tattoo be fore she turned 18 and wasn't a big fan of her getting one at all. Nothing against tattoos. Just thought such a permanent thing should wait til your a bit older and understand the permanence of it. So when she went out at 18 and got her first one, she chose an autism ribbon ( her baby sister has ASD). She thought it would butter me up. It worked a little, I thought it was sweet. It's hard to be mad when it pulls at your heart. Your sister may be crazy like a fox.", "NTA and I say this as someone who has a tattoo very visibly in the back of my neck as an idea to my very alive dad who hates tattoos. Mine was not my first tattoo mind so my father had already come to terms with me having them. If anyone called me an idiot for it I would laugh and say yeah that's half the point.", "Eeew you dirteh...", "NTA  and I say this as someone who also a commemorative tattoo for her tattoo hating father.   \n\nA tattoo should be for the person getting them, whether it\u2019s got meaning, is some random artwork or that Nelson Mandela pun tattoo that lives rent free in my head.    It\u2019s nice to have others approve and admire it, but at the end of the day, I got my tattoos for me, not for anyone else.", "NTA. Your sister is out of touch.", "On her arm? Seriously?\n\nThat's just too much...", "So wait a minute, she didn't even talk to anyone about this beforehand. Please tell me this wasn't a quick decision and that she actually planned and researched the design and artist first. \n\nIt normally takes my bff a month or two before committing to a tattoo and she is covered and usually goes to the same artist (took longer there first time she went to the artist because she wanted to be confident in the artists abilities.", "NTA. I know a girl who did the same. Got a huge tattoo to honour her dad cos she\u2019s very close to him. Her dad hates tattoos so much that she hides them (she has a lot) by wearing long sleeves all the time around him. So she\u2019ll hang out with her dad with this giant tattoo she got for him but he doesn\u2019t know and she won\u2019t tell him cos she knows he\u2019ll go mad and hates tattoos \ud83d\ude02", "NTA, as much as I have a pretty \u201cmind your own business\u201d attitude about other people\u2019s tattoos unless they\u2019re absolutely held down in prison awful. My dad passed a few years ago and he didn\u2019t like tattoos either, people ask me if I\u2019d get anything for him and I always say no for that reason - I loved my dad and we were very close, he\u2019d be mad at me if I got one for him. So I got something thoughtful and funny for my mom instead, who\u2019s come around to tattoos and got her first recently in her 60s", "NTA. She\u2019s just being a tad bit sensitive when she should laugh, too, because it\u2019s funny af.", "nta bc i get it its odd if he hates them, lol but you could've pretended to like it \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA- lf you get a tattoo to honor someone, you should.be prepared that they may not like tattoos or the tattoo itself and deal with the fallout.\n\nThis reminds me of my parents. After they got engaged in the late 70s, my dad decided to make his love for her 'permanent' and get a heart with her name on a sash running through it tattooed on his forearm. (Cliche, I know.) Anyway, my dad did not expect it to hurt so much and he only got the outline. He went and showed my mom, telling her that the artist was super busy so he would go back later to get it colored in and her name on it. My mom looked at the tattoo and looked him in the eyes and said 'I hate tattoos.' My dad never got it finished and they were married for almost 42 years before he died of a heart attack last year. They joked that if my dad had finished the tattoo and gotten her name in the sash, they would have divorced so my dad said my mom 'saved' their relationship by telling him she hated tattoos.", "NTA.  As someone who has multiple tattoos in my 40s and plans on getting more - Getting a tattoo in honor of a living person who doesn't even like tattoos is just weird.  \"I know you hate this thing but I'm honoring you with this thing!\"  It's like knowing a person hates mushrooms, throwing a party in their honor and then serving a bunch of mushroom filled dishes.  Your sister's tattoo is really more self performative than an actual tribute to your dad", "Not tattoo related but I buttered my mum up for letting me keep a free puppy coz I named her \"Hadassah\" which is the Hebrew version of her mother's name (she wanted me to name one of my kids... I was 16 at the time). Bit hard to turn down a sweet little thang with the name she always wanted lol"]}
