Why are you checking your texts on your wedding night?", "ESH\n\nWas your phone somehow powering on, opening her text messages, and forcing you to read them?\n\nYou didn't \"somehow\" wind up paying attention to her instead of your husband, you chose to. And she should have not made it an issue that night, but you should own up to the role your choices played in how your wedding night turned out.", "ESH. The bridesmaid should not have made a scene, you turned it up to 11 by posting her texts on social media. Even if she told you to do it, it brings a bunch of people into drama and makes you both look immature.", "my god, this is so immature. i\u2019m not saying you\u2019re the AH in this situation but please learn how to utilize the block button. you also didn\u2019t include your age but i\u2019m assuming you\u2019re at least in your early or mid twenties? which is entirely too old to be posting your petty drama on social media.", ">For example, my bachelorette party she claimed to need to be home with her kids, but left on a trip to Florida without her kids the same weekend.\n\nThis is irrelevant. If I was going on a trip without my kids, I would probably need to spend the night before with them, too.\n\nAs for the flirting bridesmaid drama, surely you could have just said, \u201cLook, this is a lot and it\u2019s my wedding night. I\u2019m turning my phone off now.\u201d And then just not responded anymore?\n\nHard to know who the asshole is, but I\u2019m going to go with her, because who knows what is and isn\u2019t flirting?", "ESH - **I am assuming your BIL is adult enough to handle the actions of a probably drunk bridesmaid.** The bridesmaid who stormed out was an AH for making a scene. There are better ways of handling this. (Upset bridesmaid could have asked flirting bridesmaid to go the rest room with her with some lame excuse). Your other friend should have minded her own business.  And you threw fuel on the fire for getting into it with her. Repeat after me - BIL is an adult and can handle himself! But I think you are mad about all of her actions leading up to the wedding and this is just the catalyst. As always - taking private beefs to social media is never appropriate.", "YTA. Your friend did not need to make a scene, her behavior was unnecessary, classless and she definitely should have picked another way to address this/another time. But her actions spoke for themselves, you didn\u2019t need to get involved. Period. Especially on your wedding night. You should have put your phone away and enjoyed the night with your husband.", "ESH. It sounds like a lot of drinking followed by a lot of stupidity. Maybe you can have a vow renewal when all of you grow up?", "ESH I pity the new husband the most, he wasn\u2019t even interesting enough on his wedding night. The bride needed the drama at all times, and fighting is higher on her priority list than loving or having a good time. The phone excuses are pale, the kid with a peanut allergy is a good reason to have a phone on, not a good reason to get into it with a bridesmaid. Poor dude.", "YTA, and a drama queen.", "NTA its not your job to get into the middle of a group of grown women's drama  any day of the week let alone your wedding day.", "NTA and sheesh, couldn't she wait till the next day? How annoying.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe was right: She dared you you expose yourself to the world as the Ah you are.

Poor husband.", "NTA", "NTA, she told you to do it. Congrats on getting married!", "NTA.  You posted your friend's tantrum bc she intruded on your wedding night!  What an ungrateful wedding guest.\n\nYour job as Bride does not include refereeing your guests.  Her job as bridesmaid also does not include minding other peoples' business.\n\nI really wish you had had the strength to turn off your phone and enjoy your wedding night.  Sometimes being in touch with other people *all the time* is not a good thing.  Basically, *you* gave your special time with your husband away to a nagging, criticizing person.\n\nThink about it.  You are not obligated to respond to someone immediately just bc they call or text you.", "NTA, honestly. You\u2019re getting a lot of shit, and perhaps you should\u2019ve blocked her right off the bat, but I feel like your wedding day isn\u2019t a day where you are immediately in defense mode. You\u2019re essentially a host, so I can see why you tried to calm shit down.
