I want to be totally clear that his parents haven\u2019t done anything wrong and they\u2019re not bad people. The issue is they live 26 hrs away. They have never meet either of their grandchildren and I have only meet his mom and sister when I was pregnant with our first and met up half way. So they are basically strangers to me as well as complete strangers to the girls. Yet my husband is really pushing to take the trip he hasn\u2019t seen his family in 5 yrs. My refusal comes in with the logistics of it all. Our girls are really big grammas and papas girls on my side they always have been and since we are temporary living with my parents as we wait for our new place the girls are bonding even more to them. So that would be like ripping them away from all they ever known and putting them into unknown territory with a bunch of strangers that are going to try hugging kissing holding them and I know that would make them uncomfortable and it would bother me too I don\u2019t want anyone blood or not to cross my girls boundaries. Beyond that the trip anyone who has ever had to ride in a car with a toddler or a baby knows that would be constant stopping upset babies and just plain frustrating for 26 hrs that\u2019s just a really long time to have them in car seats too. I\u2019ve also entertained the idea of a plane but handling two little ones on a small cramped plane with people who don\u2019t want to hear them seems so great *eye roll* I can\u2019t do the plane though I have extremely sensitive ears due to a hole in my eardrums after having tubes as a kid till 18. Even if we got through the traveling part then comes sleep schedules they\u2019d be all messed up and I don\u2019t like sleeping in random places so why would the girls? With all this in mind I just had another disagreement with the hubby about it again after he brought up \u201cCompromises\u201d one being we meet 1/2 way again still 13 hour trip and another being we stay the summer again they\u2019ll miss my parents that have been with them their whole life. Plus he\u2019s and over the road trucker he\u2019s only home 1 week out of a month or a month in a half so majority of child care is me. He\u2019ll get to leave and have me deal with sleep schedule and I can\u2019t see my gram or papa melt downs that she has now and we live with them at the moment. All of that would be on me in some strangers home. He says and I quote \u201cso what the girls will get it over it\u201d my response was \u201cso will your family\u201d. Also I want to point out that I have told him I\u2019m totally fine with him going down there by himself but he doesn\u2019t want to go alone. So with all this in mind am I?\n \nI want to clarify some things 1st being that I have offered to host their grandparents over the last 2 years in our old place and have offered to host once we settle in our new place they have never taken the offer. \n\n2 I have offered ft so that the babies would at least start to recognize their voices and faces but they haven\u2019t taken that offer either. So this is basically one sided relationship on our end to them.\n\n3 my husband wants us to go down for the whole summer but he would only be there 2-3 weeks out of 2-3 months because the only way to afford this would be for him to work I have offered to do one week but he got offended saying 1 week wasn\u2019t enough so my next offer was 1 week all together and the next month he could take his week alone which he didn\u2019t like either.", "created_utc": 1686459131, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146ktff/aita_for_refusing_to_take_my_girls_to_meet_their/", "score": 74, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I always had to drive the 10 hour trips to visit my husbands family (who hated me) because it was about our kid and our kid forming a relationship with their grandparents. **Trips like these will ALWAYS be inconvenient, they truthfully may never be fun or enjoyable for you**, **but it's about letting your children meet their other grandparents. Its not about you.**\n\nPersonally, **nothing you said would convince me that you shouldn't go, because everything you said is a basic part of life and taking trips.**  Like they suck. Rarely will you EVER even get close to the family trip of your dreams. It may always feel like a hassle and I promise there will ALWAYS be a reason to not want to go, you basically listed why you should never take a trip with a family ever regardless of the reason.\n\nYour parents are not your kids parents, your kids also have another set of grandparents and it will do them MORE of a disservice to not find a way for them to meet each other.\n\nYour kids won't be traumatized because they have their parents there, they will have another set of loving family there that they get to meet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If they would be  -that- upset about leaving their maternal grandparents then there are issues beyond this and it most likely means that they spend more time with your parents than they do their own parents. This is its own issue, but its neither your husbands parents fault, nor your kids fault.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBased on what you are saying, **it feels like that you just don't want to deal with your husbands parents and the trip, which is totally relatable, but it's not about you or what you want, it's about what the kids deserve.**\n\n**Giving a child more family to have**, to be able to become close too, to be able to get to know, **should ALWAYS trump your children being sad because they went on a summer vacation and missed their maternal grandparents.** It will have to happen at some point.\n\n**Don't burn a bridge for your children that they never had a chance to build. Give them the chance to build the bridge and let them make the choice as they get older whether or not they want to keep the bridge.**\n\nThe only question I have is: Is there anything that stops his family from visiting? Health? Finances? Something that may make it harder for them in the long run? If so, then you should do what you can to go to them.\n\n**Ya'll -clearly- have a plan to meet them, at this point it's -you- who are shooting it down.**\n\nIf there's nothing stopping them, then ya'll need to all facetime or talk and figure something out. If they won't come down, but you are -able- to visit them, do it once. Get it out of the way and rip off the band aid. As I said, if later on their paternal grandparents never want to visit, then that will be on them and it'll be up to your children to choose whether to want to be involved in the future, but don't put up a roadblock because it's annoying.\n\n**For all you know they may be on the same fence as you and not wanting to go to a \"strangers\" home, you def don't seem welcoming.**\n\nIf you think the reasons you listed are good enough reasons to not have your children meet their paternal grandparents, then YTA.  \n\n\n  \nEdit: After talking to the OP for the last hour or so back and forth and reading comments I'm going with ESH because it sounds like the entire family is messed up.", "ESH. The logistics of taking two small kids on a long trip is a totally reasonable reason to not take the trip. And the fact that your husband wouldn\u2019t even be there for most of it, another reason to not go. \n\nWhere you\u2019re not quite reasonable is the comment about ripping the babies from the grandparents they know to put them with strangers and they\u2019ll be uncomfortable. You\u2019re going to be uncomfortable with the strangers of your husband\u2019s family, don\u2019t project that on the girls. It is completely reasonable for you to be uncomfortable living in a strangers home without your husband. \n\nHowever, you not wanting to undertake a miserable long car ride, over multiple days, just to stay with strangers is valid. Your husband wants you to: leave your support system, take a ridiculously long drive, stay with his family without him, and handle of the childcare before during and after the trip. \n\nI\u2019m exhausted just trying to plan the logistics of the car trip. Your kids are too small for you to take on a long trip like that. Period. You are the one who will have to do the planning and make it work, and you know yourself and your kids. It\u2019s really, really easy to tell a mom with two kids to take a long trip. You know what isn\u2019t easy? Being the mom taking the kids. \n\nJust think very hard about how much effort his family has made to see you and the girls. Hopefully it will help make your decision easier when you compare what a trip would entail.", "Let me get this straight. You think you\u2019d be ripping your kids from your parents just if you visit your husband\u2019s parents?\n\nYTA. I\u2019d be incredibly upset if I was your husband. He has every right to want his parents to meet your kids.", "YTA - they have 2 sets of grandparents and you\u2019re blocking your husbands parents for no reason.", "Yta. It feels like you are using the logistics of travel as an excuse because you keep harping on the children's bond with your parents, it feels like you see it as some competition and don't want your children to have a relationship with their paternal side. Yes travel with Littles sux. But. They are your husband's children too and you need to be willing to compromise and honour his wishes too. You sound very rigid inflexible and selfish.", "YTA-the kids will not love your parents less if they develop a relationship with the rest of their grandparents.  The travel excuse is just that-an excuse.  You are completely disregarding the feelings of everyone that did not give birth to you.\n\nDo better.", "Wow.  Yes.  YTA.  Like, times 1,000!  Your husband hasn't seen HIS family in 5 years?  HIS children have never met HIS parents, THEIR grandparents?  But you live with YOUR parents and, oh geez they are just SOOOO important and \"how could they be away from them?\"  Meanwhile you're holding your children hostage from their other (and equal) grandparents!  You tear down every (perfectly reasonable) reason to go and see them.  It seems like YOU do not want your children (just to highlight, also your HUSBANDS children) to bond with their grandparents.  You do not want your husband or your kids to have a relationship.  You seem to think that the kids should only ever have your side of the family.  What you are doing is wrong and harmful to your husband, your marriage, and your children.  You need to stop.  Get over the struggles and figure out what way you are going to make it work.  Spend the summer with their grandparents (and to be abundantly clear I mean HIS parents), who will likely be incredibly happy to help.  Your kids will be find being able to meet and bond with THEIR grandparents, they don't need to ONLY bond with yours.  \n\nI cannot believe this is even being asked.  Your husband is an extremely tolerant man because this is ridiculous.  Stop pushing him to lose his family or he will be leaving you so his children can have a relationship with his family (THEIR family) as well.", "Why can't they come to you? They wouldn't be the ones travelling with infants/toddlers?", "YTA   Of course your husband wants to show his children off to his family.  Kids are very adaptable. When my daughters were 1 and 2 years old, we drove 36 hours to go see family. We made a game out of it for the kids.  Experiencing new things is part of learning.", "NTA. OP can\u2019t fly, so driving is the only option. 26 hours there and then a week with the in laws and then 26 hours home. Or staying the whole summer seems crazy. \n\nFirst off, how the hell do these commenters not know a 2 month CANNOT be in the car that long. And before someone questions me fuckin Google it. 2 month old baby cannot be in the car seat more than 2 hours in a 24 hour span. Full stop. \n\nAnd for anyone saying OP is \u201cstopping\u201d the in laws from having a relationship with the grandchildren, why can\u2019t OPs husband facilitate visits? Why can\u2019t he go visit? OP doesn\u2019t have a relationship with the in laws either, and that\u2019s for the husband to facilitate.\n\nSimple solution would be for in-laws to go visit OP. But they haven\u2019t atleast since baby\u2019s have been born so 2 years.\n\nAll these people saying YTA - doesn\u2019t sound like they have kids. Because who in their right mind thinks they should travel 26 hours with a 20 month old and a 2 month old?", "INFO\n\nwhy are the grandparents not coming to visit you guys?", "NTA. Driving 26 hours with a newborn in a car seat is not safe. The recommendation is 2 hours at a time with frequent breaks. That's just not feasible for a long haul trip like that.\n\nBut you have to make room and welcome for them to come visit you at your families house, or seriously consider the plane.  You have to compromise. Going on a plane, with your husband, for a week long trip while he's off work is a good compromise.\n\nYour husband's family is as important to him as yours is to you. Consider how heartbreaking it is for him to be away for so long.", "I was going to say Y T A based on what you said about ripping your children from your grandparents. That's not a good point to make, especially not to justify not visiting family. However I absolutely agree that driving 20+ hours with a toddler and a baby is out of question, as well as staying for months at a place you don't know anyone at, while your husband won't even be there for most of the time. Those are valid concerns. Why don't his parents come visit you instead? Seems like a much better compromise. If they are struggling financially you could offer to help them out with the costs, since if you traveled there you'd have used the money for that anyways. You can still visit them with the kids when they are older, it's just for now! NTA", "Going against the grain here - you are nta - and I\u2019m confused why there are so many downvotes and negative comments.\n\nAll these people saying yeah just go and see them have clearly never spent 26 hours in a car with tiny children. It\u2019s hell. At 2m postpartum mom bodies are still weird too. Often not healed fully with lots of toilet issues, and a 2 month old couldn\u2019t be in the car that long. If baby is breastfeeding they would need to be fed every 2-3 hours which means stopping the car, getting baby out, changing them etc. then you have a toddler on top it it.\n\nThis would realistically have to be spread out over 4 days at 6h a day maximum. Sounds torture.\n\nThe easiest solution is for them to come and visit you - I don\u2019t see why they are not? \n\nThe \u201cthey will miss their grandparentsssss\u201d nonsense is irrelevant, however if the grandparents on the fathers side want to meet the newborn they should have to come to you. \nDad is free to go and see his family alone if he wants to obviously.", "YTA \n\nYou can try and justify it all you want but you\u2019re being unreasonable - it\u2019s your way or no way. \n\nYou haven\u2019t been ever - and your husband hasn\u2019t been in 5 years. Make the effort. Your reasons are just more facts that YTA in this situation.", "You are hella TA. So much yes. \n\nSo selfish. I can\u2019t even.", "I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to spend the entire summer with individuals you are not close with. However, your other reasonings such as \u201cripping them away,\u201d from your parents is a bit ridiculous. Your children can form relationships with their other family and still life and have a bond with yours. \n\nYour an AH for some of the reasonings you gave. Your NTA for not wanting to stay with individuals you have no relationship with without your husband present. The compromise you stay the 2-3weeks there with your husband present and you return home with your children. If your husband doesn\u2019t like it then oh well. He doesn\u2019t have to like it but that\u2019s why it\u2019s called a compromise. I would also encourage you to start making those FaceTime calls yourself to see if you and the girls can bond with his family. If they choose not to engage or make an effort after that then you are justified in not continuing to have a one sided relationship.", "YTA. I can see you arguing in the comments. Why did you post here if you're just going to argue with everybody you aren't the ass hole? Stop being the issue. Everybody's voting YTA because YTA.\n\nIt's these kinds of stories that win over judges in custody court. \"My kids have never been allowed to go see my parents once in their whole lives because of her\" oh lordy lordy, that's gonna be brought up REPEATEDLY.", ">Our girls are really big grammas and papas girls on my side they always   \nhave been and since we are temporary living with my parents as we wait   \nfor our new place the girls are bonding even more to them.

Again you are justifying not taking a plane. I totally understand the not wanting to take the car for 26 hours, but it is doable, not enjoyable but doable. We sometimes have to make sacrifices for family. \n\nI cannot believe I have to say this to an adult with children.  Suck it up! Pick we either go in the car or we go on the plane together or let him take them without you.\n\nI will put it simply, it is not important to you and inconvenient to you so you do not want to go.  Then fine.  Let your husband take them without you. You stay home and he can get on a plane with the children and without you.  I am willing to bet he is willing to do this and tolerate the behaviour.  Plus the other passengers will have to deal with it, even if you are not willing to.\n\nHe has a right to see his family and his family have a right to see his children. I am just sorry that your empathy is low you cannot even understand this. I am willing to bet if it were reversed and you were living with his parents and your parents were 26 hours away... you would be in that care every year if not more than once than a year.", "Wait wait wait, he wants you to bring two kids under two to his parents house 26 hours away and then leave you guys there for the whole summer to go to work as a trucker?? That\u2019s unreasonable. If he is so adamant about going to his family then he needs to take time off work and be there the whole time with you. It\u2019s not fair to expect you to handle two small kids on your own amongst strangers in a new environment when you could be home in a known and relaxing environment for all of you. \n\nAlso, why can\u2019t his family come visit you? He hasn\u2019t seen his family in 5 years, but they also haven\u2019t come to visit in those 5 years. It shouldn\u2019t just be on him, and by extension you and the kids, to travel. Meeting halfway isn\u2019t really a great compromise when it\u2019s still 13 hours in the car. \n\nNTA", "Ooof I\u2019m going to get downvoted here but NTA. I think some of your argument is flawed but probably because you are young and haven\u2019t learned the skills of successful \u201carguing\u201d with your hubby yet.\n\n1st/ I completely understand really not wanting to take your babies to spend the summer with essential strangers. Especially when you\u2019re very close to your family and they are your village helping you raise your kids. Not know how much help you\u2019ll get from the other side is probably very stressful. \n\n2nd/ That road trip sounds like hell. I voted really based on never traveling more than 5 hours with my baby and toddler and hated so much of it. I would also really dislike spending 3 months in a strangers home. I get they are your hubbys family but that is too long!\n\nCompromise with your hubby. If you can afford it, fly!! It\u2019s much easier to fly. Stay 2-3 weeks. Really give your in laws a lot of time with your kids. Be flexible with the schedule and their time. Let them get to know your kids. \n\nQuick tip: you are your child\u2019s boundary. If they don\u2019t want to be held or hugged by a stranger. Take your child\u2019s hand and move them away from that person. Or kneel down and hug them first. Encourage the other person to do them same. Get down on their level, get to know them first. My daughter (3) hugged her paternal aunt for the first time this Christmas and my SIL almost cried she was so happy to be the first person my daughter hugged. This was before MIL and FIL.\n\nYou\u2019re not being unreasonable for having issues with this trip. Yes your hubby deserves time with his family. But not at the expense of your immediate family. Compromise!!", "NTA, 26 hours is far even without children. Grandparents have never met them but oldest is 2 so can't see that they're making an effort. Why should the onus be on you to travel to them? Especially given the lack of existing relationship between you/kids and them.\n\nI'd agree to take them when they're older and invite the grandparents to visit you instead. If you refuse to let them ever go then you would be an asshole, otherwise na.", "Driving 26 hours each way with 2 babies would really suck\u2026 I totally fell you there. people saying that it would be no big deal either have no kids or have never taken their kids on a long road trip.  I\u2019ve done a 15 hour road trip with one extremely well behaved baby and it was rough\u2026 that being said, it\u2019s totally do-able as a worst case scenario.\n\nI guess to me the obvious solution would be to fly your in-laws in.  Also, from what you say it\u2019s weird that your in-laws don\u2019t just come\u2026 if it\u2019s truely a money thing maybe offer to cover half of the cost of the flight or something?  Figure out how much you would pay in gas and offer to contribute that to the cost of flights?\n\nIn conclusion, I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to make the drive, but family is important and I would personally do it if that was the only choice.", "YTA. You are making no effort for your children to have a relationship with your husband\u2019s family. I bet if your parents lived 26 hours away, you would be a lot more accomodating in your views. You were utterly dismissive telling him his family will get over it. \n\nIf your kids never spend time away from your parents, that\u2019s going to cause issues at some point.", "YTA.  Stop being selfish and making excuses.  All of them can be overcome, you just don't want to put it any effort because it's his family and not yours.  What if the situation was reversed and your husband was refusing to travel to see your family, how would you like that?  If you continue to refuse this will become a much bigger issue and could end your marriage due to resentment.", "YTA it's obvious your family means a lot to you. Imagine if your situation was switched and he was the one having a fit to keep you from your parents?", "NTA. Your husband\u2019s parents have made no effort to get to know you, and your husband isn\u2019t willing to be flexible with your suggestion of visiting all together for a week, which is an *entirely* reasonable compromise. \n\nLots of people in this thread overstating the importance and influence of grandparents if you ask me. I only remember one of mine. Sure it would have been nice to know the others but there\u2019s no gaping hole or anything.", "I\u2019m going with NTA here\u2026maybe because I have a baby and understand the logistics of it. I think you have a great compromise and your husband needs to get over it. He can\u2019t expect you to spend months alone with his parents while he is off working. So you go for a week (maybe two if he can get some extra time off) and you are only there while you are both there. I would never expect my husband to hang out with my family for months on end without me.", "NTA. I\u2019m convinced the people saying otherwise did not read the whole post. Also, based off OP\u2019s comments, the grandparents are fully capable of traveling to them but just don\u2019t care enough to. The only thing that does make OP sound like an AH is that the children may be upset at being away from their maternal grandparents. However, it does seem like being away from the grandparents will be rough for OP, who help OP with child care. OP is a mom taking care of her very young children while her husband goes away for long periods of time. Husband wants OP to be with his grandparents for a whole summer, while OP takes care her of young children without the help of anyone. And make no mistake, if husband\u2019s parents have not made any effort to travel or video call, then they won\u2019t make any effort to help OP. She will basically be on her own with two young children while in a strangers\u2019 house. And we don\u2019t know if she may be forced to walk on eggshells at the strangers\u2019 house. The husband is not considerate at all of the responsibility and stress he is thrusting upon her, basically leaving her to fend for herself. OP may seem to have an AH tone in this thread, but take into consideration that she gave birth just two months ago and her husband is stressing her out with his unwavering demands. I too would be upset like OP and it would show in the way I talk. The husband and his grandparents are not compromising at all. OP keeps offering solutions but they\u2019re all rejected. Also, it\u2019s simply unsafe to have a 2-month old in the car for so many hours. I think some people are focusing too much on the one weak reason she stated instead of the multiple, very valid reasons she stated.", "YTA and a massive one at that.. who cares about your parents, they will survive without seeing the kids for a few days and the kids will survive without seeing your parents for a few days.\n\nAll you are doing is making up stupid silly excuses to suit your own agenda, you are nothing but selfish. Your husband even tried comprising by halving the trip but you still are being petty and dismissive.\n\nUltimately I feel sorry that your children were born to someone like you, it\u2019s going to suck being raised by you.", "YTA. They are not strangers. They are his and your kids' family. Stop alienating them.", "NTA I understand him wanting his patent to meet the kids however as his parents are strangers to you and kids and 99.9% of the child care falls on you and he is home maybe 30 days a year. His parents can come to you and stay in a hotel. Tell you absolutely will not stay in a strange place with strangers. If he absolutely insist then tell him that he can get a hotel room for you and the kids and a room for your parents or a airbnb for the duration of your stay", "YTA - so you and your partner met, got married and had kids but you have only met them once?\n\nBut you feel it should all be on them to visit you when you haven\u2019t ever visited them either? \n\nGrow up.", "NTA. I know this is the unpopular opinion but 26 hours with two kids two and younger is insane especially since they want to go by car. And when you have kids that young it's really hard to travel, let alone 26 hours in a car. Why can't his parents come to you? Because they don't want to make that long trip that's why.

Obviously the baby's not going to know the difference but the two-year-old will, well I think you're saying they're 20 months they're almost two.

I want to be totally clear that his parents haven\u2019t done anything wrong and they\u2019re not bad people. The issue is they live 26 hrs away. They have never meet either of their grandchildren and I have only meet his mom and sister when I was pregnant with our first and met up half way. So they are basically strangers to me as well as complete strangers to the girls. Yet my husband is really pushing to take the trip he hasn\u2019t seen his family in 5 yrs. My refusal comes in with the logistics of it all. Our girls are really big grammas and papas girls on my side they always have been and since we are temporary living with my parents as we wait for our new place the girls are bonding even more to them. So that would be like ripping them away from all they ever known and putting them into unknown territory with a bunch of strangers that are going to try hugging kissing holding them and I know that would make them uncomfortable and it would bother me too I don\u2019t want anyone blood or not to cross my girls boundaries. Beyond that the trip anyone who has ever had to ride in a car with a toddler or a baby knows that would be constant stopping upset babies and just plain frustrating for 26 hrs that\u2019s just a really long time to have them in car seats too. I\u2019ve also entertained the idea of a plane but handling two little ones on a small cramped plane with people who don\u2019t want to hear them seems so great *eye roll* I can\u2019t do the plane though I have extremely sensitive ears due to a hole in my eardrums after having tubes as a kid till 18. Even if we got through the traveling part then comes sleep schedules they\u2019d be all messed up and I don\u2019t like sleeping in random places so why would the girls? With all this in mind I just had another disagreement with the hubby about it again after he brought up \u201cCompromises\u201d one being we meet 1/2 way again still 13 hour trip and another being we stay the summer again they\u2019ll miss my parents that have been with them their whole life. Plus he\u2019s and over the road trucker he\u2019s only home 1 week out of a month or a month in a half so majority of child care is me. He\u2019ll get to leave and have me deal with sleep schedule and I can\u2019t see my gram or papa melt downs that she has now and we live with them at the moment. All of that would be on me in some strangers home. He says and I quote \u201cso what the girls will get it over it\u201d my response was \u201cso will your family\u201d. Also I want to point out that I have told him I\u2019m totally fine with him going down there by himself but he doesn\u2019t want to go alone.

That is seriously a stretch that only makes you look petty and\u2026quite frankly reaching.\n\nAnd yes, if you are literally living with your parents, forcing your husband to live with your parents, thus taking full advantage of that situation, the fair response would be that once ever 5 years you put forth the same effort towards your inlaws, your husband has towards his inlaws. \n\nI think after 5 years he\u2019s due.", "2 month olds should not be in the car for 26 hours.\n\nIt makes a lot more logistical sense for the grandparents to visit them.\n\nThat said, Op\u2019s attitude about \u201cripping the kids away from *her* parents\u201d makes her the AH.\n\nYou should understand why it\u2019s important to your husband for your kids to have this relationship.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think Op is unreasonable for not wanting to spend the entire summer, at what is essentially to her, a stranger\u2019s house, without her husband.

Is that the root of it?
