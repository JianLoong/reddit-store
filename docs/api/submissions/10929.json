Moreover depending what state you live in, giving a permission to stay for several months may make kicking them out later significantly harder from legal perspective.", "NTA\n\nDepending on where you live, that can open a whole slew of issues. Squatters' rights are real and if they are present long enough to establish those, it's a huge legal mess to get them tossed off your property. Even though they aren't supposed to be there, if they suffered any sort of injury while on your property, they could sue you. It's also possible that their cooking setup could spark a fire, and where on earth are they toileting? Life knocks us all around eventually, but that doesn't mean we can start camping in strangers' backyards because of it. Plus, think of how long they said they were there before you were aware; all it takes is one party mentioning the nice quiet camp they set up before someone else wants a piece and then you have a community back there instead of a few people...Nope. They can parade their sad story all over Facebook but at the end of the day, they were attempting to live someplace that they had no right to be without permission.", "NTA. Consider also putting up some trail cams.

They move onto your property as squatters without even asking permission and they try to make it viral when you say no and kick them off. They are saying there is no hsopitality, but they never asked for it and you are not a hotel. If you let them stay, I bet there will be more guests sooner than later as they will post how they found a nice place to pitch a tent on your property. They are not 'entitled' to stay and you should not feel guilty. As you noted, you know nothing about them and are a single female. Also, make the rounds of your property more often. They may decide to come back.", "NTA - They stay, have an accident with the cooker and start a fire. Or they get injured on your property then sue you. Not to mention where are they pooping and putting their trash and baby diapers?", "NTA, you can't solve the worlds problems yourself and you definitely don't want the liability and risk of strangers setting up encampments on your property.  Let it go too long, and you could have real legal issues evicting them.\n\nAnyone who says you are heartless is welcome to host homeless encampments on their own property, if they're not willing to do so, then they can shut up.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nif anything you were kind.

It would be nice to help people, but in today's world of unknown dangers and overly litigious people, you can't take a chance. Hopefully the police referred them to an agency for help, in fact I would think the presence of a baby would set off a referral to CPS. I probably would have paid for a few nights in a motel because of the baby, but maybe not, being a soft touch on a personal level can bite you in the tuckus.", "NTA. It sucks that they are in that situation, but they aren't entitled to squat on your property. You nailed the main reason I'd say no; you don't know these people. NTA.", "NTA\n\nIt is not your responsibility to personally step in and save these people. You did not feel safe or comfortable to do so, and that is completely fair. The state of the rental market isn\u2019t your doing.

It is not your responsibility to let these people live on your property. Especially when they didn\u2019t even ask first", "NTA \n\nIt is your property. If anything happens, you will be held liable. You can lose everything you have worked hard for. Not to mention, drugs and child? Nope. Absolutely not.", "NTA\n\nThey were trespassing on your property. Depending on where you live there are laws that say property owners are legally responsible for any injuries people sustain on their property even if those people are there illegally without permission from the owner. You did the right thing by having them escorted off your property so that you are protected.", "NTA.  You don't know who they are, their history or their plans to better their situation.  Additionally, how are they planning to dispose of their trash, and will they take you to court if they are injured?  How are they disposing of their human waste as well?  Your property is not set up to protect you or them.  I agree with them that rent prices, landlords, and the inability to acquire affordable housing to move forward are a crisis.  However, that isn't for you to manage.  There are many ways you can assist the less fortunate that don't involve allowing unknown people to live on your property.", "NTA. I had a client who had big issues with a homeless man living on her property. Do not let people live on your land in tents , you'll regret it", "NTA  You saw the drugs, you live alone, you don't know these people or what they are capable of.

No, the situations aren't exactly the same yet I see some of the same problems: potential tenants' rights, aggressiveness, drugs, etc.", "NTA. They illegally trespassed onto your land as squatters then have the nerve to get upset when you nicely ask them to leave?\n\nHospitality is in knocking on the front door and asking if you can stay in the first place not sneaking around the back.  Even then hospitality is letting someone stay for a night not months on end. Typical that they prioritise a phone plan for facebook and drugs but not say rent or taking care of their child.", "NTA - they should have sought you out 3 weeks ago.", "NTA. They're squatters.", "And if you hadn\u2019t found them before hunting came back in season, they could easily have gotten shot.", "NTA. It's your land. Would it have been nice to let them stay, especially because they have a toddler? Yeah maybe. But it doesn't make you an AH to not want them on your land. It's also possible that more homeless people could join them and if it grows into a larger camp, then it's a big problem. There are also certain places where if you let them stay they can claim some kind of tenants rights.", "NTA\nI have yet to see squatters that take care of anything and don't leave trash behind or destroy the area they live in.\nIt's  a huge liability to have them on your property, and the longer they are there, the harder it is to get them to move on. You Don't know these people or if they have good habits. If something goes wrong, you could be liable.", "NTA.  If this compels them to find a shelter on behalf of their baby, then all the better.  You can\u2019t in good conscience enable a life like that for an infant.", "NTA. You need to do some research on the laws in your state regarding squatters right and adverse possession. If you give these people permission to stay on your land for a long time, they may acquire the legal right to continue living there. You absolutely did the right thing when you evicted them.", "INFO:  How do you know they have been blasting you on facebook. How they even know your name?", "NTA.... It's your property. And they are not your responsibility. At most, maybe give them a couple days to figure something out, then have them booted.", "NTA. I live in an area with a large houseless population, and the camps are a huge problem. Even a single tent with a couple of people accumulates trash, can cause fires, and there is likely a lot of improperly disposed human waste all around. And the longer they are permitted, the bolder they can become. \n\nHomelessness sucks, wish we could do more, but allowing unregulated camps without proper infrastructure (especially long term) is a lot of liability and problems that are hard to stop once they've  been permitted.", "NTA \n\nAnd I LOVE upsetty spaghetti \ud83d\ude02", "NTA - one tent becomes 4 tents, becomes 12 tents...", "NTA\n\nBasically you'd be their landlord.

And, for all of this, you wouldn't be paid a dime.", " NTA. Sneak onto your property while bringing drugs with them. A small dirty child?

It is sad that they are in such a tough spot, especially with a child. But what you did was right. More so, considering your living situation.\n\n2. I don't know where you live but in many states, squatters can gain legal rights on the property after a certain period of time and if certain conditions are met. Again, I'm not sure about the situation where you live but it is better to be safe than sorry.\n\n3.

Does that not grab you folks like a new pair of pliers as being somehow just a little wrong?", "NTA though I am currently homeless with two dogs living in a pretty much broken truck so I understand how they are feeling. There are less and less places for someone to go and feel safe if you are homeless. Shelters and transient homes won't help if you have dogs and they are my babies. Before anyone says we'll just foster them out...would you if you were homeless with kids? \nAs for the drugs, depending on what state they were in. They may have a medical card. And as for illegal stuff, the hardest thing to do being homeless next to finding a way to shower, a place to sleep, renew an id or get a job or home, is be sober. Hubby and I have been sober for years, but when people try to run you over, call you a fat waste of space, or just waking up knowing that the same thing is gonna happen and maybe just maybe you may make enough to get a room. it's extremely hard to not drink or do drugs cause you can't escape physically. \nLike I said I agree with you. If they were gonna pitch a tent, they should have at least asked if it's ok. Of course I'm not saying you should have agreed, but they should have had the decency and respect to ask.  And definitely not blast you on social.media. as for your name, it's called county appraisal district. That's always public unless you are a government official like a cop.\nSorry for the rambling. I haven't really slept since my hubby had a stroke last month and it's now muggy and mosquitos everywhere at night so it sux. Hope this makes sense lol", "I was on their side till the nonsense on social media.\nLook\u2014I was homeless. A few different women gave me a place to stay. I was a 20 year old single woman.

I start out early, and by noon I'm at the final stretch in the back-east corner. Then, I saw *it*.\n\n*It* was a green tent, a gas cooker thingy, a man, woman, baby/toddler, and a little cooler. There was also what looked like a baggy of weed on top of the cooler. The kid was visibly dirty.\n\nNow, I'm a single woman who lives alone. I have no idea who these people are, or what they want, so I go and call the cops. \n\nThe cops come, and the people lay out their story. Evicted a few weeks ago, have been here for about 3 weeks, nowhere to go. They ask the cops to ask me if they can stay. I ask for how long. They say 2-3 months. I say absolutely not.
