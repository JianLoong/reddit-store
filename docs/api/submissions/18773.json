Hinduism is one the most inclusive religion. The religion allows for gay marriage and many other things. If you don't want to support that's fine but don't blame the religion", "NTA because teachers can\u2019t force you to make a public social media statement if you don\u2019t want to. You also aren\u2019t in the school pride club- she can\u2019t mandate you to participate in an optional extracurricular. \n\nHOWEVER, I am curious to know what specific teachings and beliefs in Hinduism are anti-LGBT, I have never heard this before. I\u2019m also Tamil and I would argue that most of the homophobia I see in the Indian community is cultural, not religious.\n\nCan\u2019t speak for Canada, but in the US Tamil people do not face the same kind of inequalities and vitriol that LGBTQIA people do. This is likely why the teacher highlighted only Pride month. \n\nSo while I say NTA- I would suggest you step back and seriously reevaluate why you are uncomfortable with supporting (openly or not) the LGBTQIA community.", "NTA. Gay man here. \n\nLook, I don't think religion is a great reason to not support anybody, and I hope that with time and age you'll learn that as well. That said, if you don't feel comfortable with something, you shouldn't have to do it. There is a halfway point between ally and homophobe, and you're definitely not a homophobe just because you don't want to participate in this particular thing. \n\nThat said, I do hope in time you'll discover that LGBTQ+ people are just like you, we're no different and there's no reason to be \"against\" us.", "NTA\n\nAs a member of the LGBTQ community myself, I think it's so weird they would force you to do this and berate you afterwards if you didn't. Having support is wonderful, but it means nothing if it's fake or forced. And having it posted online with your name could be dangerous for people in strict, religious households. A different activity/exercise for pride month would definitely be better.", "On the one hand, you shouldn't be forced to post anything publicly, especially as a minor. On the other hand, just because your beliefs are religious doesn't mean they can't be homophobic.", "NTA.\n\nForced support is just a theater performance. Real change comes from engaging in conversations.\n\nMy LGBTQ+ friends have said that if they encounter someone who doesn\u2019t agree with their life and partner choice that they just want to be left alone. They want to live their lives. They don\u2019t want a lecture. They don\u2019t want hate language. They would much rather a \u201clive and let live\u201d style attitude. \n\nSounds like you are executing that approach.", "NTA. Your teacher should not be saying that to you, they should be respectful of your decision. And it is totally okay to not want your opinions plastered about on your schools ig, but you need to think about why you\u2019re so uncomfortable about supporting the LGBTQ. \n\nDo some research and look into it, you might not understand the actual topic of LGBTQ, many of my friends were the same as you, horribly against it but once they did their own research they realised it was not such a bad thing. Listening and taking others opinions end up causing our own to form as a mirror of the ones we\u2019ve heard, which might be the case for you as you\u2019re still young and your parents may have extreme views and opinions which fall back on you, make your own opinions and if you still decide to not support then that\u2019s your decision, just don\u2019t be actively homophobic and just accept it as it is. \n\nHowever with the LGBTQ being against your religious beliefs, please delve into this topic. I, myself am a hindu and have very well done some research, there is no reason in our culture or religion to be against supporting or being part of the LGBTQ, our religion is so broad and beautiful same goes for others, just a small example is Vishnu who takes on the form of Mohini a female avatar but she is still vishnu in the form as a female. She went on to love another man but it was still vishnu in the form of Mohini loving that man. Heterosexuality was never a normalcy in the Hindu culture thousands of years ago, there\u2019s so many texts and writings depicting it but are not widely talked about. \n\nBut truly NTA, you don\u2019t deserve to be harassed about this by a teacher.", "I think it's weird that there was no class conversation or educational event or anything, and after that you could have decided whether you want to write a note.\n\nI'm all for supporting pride, but especially when working with teenagers it would make much more sense to use the opportunity for conversation than to pressure students into something they don't want to do.\n\nAnd your reasoning that you don't want friends to see/having to justify yourself in front of them is valid given your age.

I don't agree with you (I'm gay) and I don't really like religion but you're entitled to your own beliefs and opinions.

They can't force you to support it similarly to how they can't force you to practice certain religions. I have a feeling you'll be targeted after this by this teacher  and not get fairly graded etc so you may want to bring this up with the principal the name calling as well and calmly state your side and bring up that if needed you will send it to the superintendent or higher which will get them sweating to take action.

There are millions of religious people that can conciliate their spirituality and embrace LGBTQ community, respect abortion rights or other things.", "I mean, you're not the asshole for not wanting to participate, but you are in fact a homophobe if being queer is against your religion. There are queer hindus. It is in fact possible to reconcile your religion and people's identities. It isn't impossible.", "NTA \n\nI used to be a teacher. I also follow a religion that traditionally teaches that being gay is a sin. However, I believe that LGBT+ people are still people who should be treated with the same equality that heterosexual people receive. It is not okay to discriminate against someone because of their sexuality. \n\nYour teacher's approach was unprofessional and childish. I would have explained to you in a way that you would understand why it is important to respect everyone's differences. It is the job of a teacher to educate a child on topics rather than act accusatory and demonise the child. \n\nLike I said, you are entitled to your personal beliefs, but remember LGBT+ people are still human beings like yourself. Most religions teach the importance of showing compassion and kindness towards others.", "What is again your religion as a Hindu?", "NTA.

I think your teacher is overstepping boundaries.\n\nA more appropriate assignment would be what you have learned about why your school supports pride.

You don\u2019t have to be openly / publicly supportive to be respectful of others.", "NTA but how do you believe in reincarnation but not gay people?", "NTA, but dude I am a hindu as well, and our religion does not have anything against lgbtq community. Here are a few instances that they have been portrayed in hindusim:\n1) LGBTQ community in traditional sanskrit are called the \"Kinnaras\". They are supposed to be a part of the Devasena of Indra (basically they are warriors of the heavnly host)\n\n2) Shikhandi, who is a character from Mahabharata who played a crucial role in the great war. Shikhandi was a transgender, born and reborn many times as female, but decided to change her gender to male so that she could fight in Mahabharata. She was the reason why Arjun was able to kill Bhishma, without whose death there was no way that Pandavas could have won.\n\n3) it is clearly mentioned in Krishna Leela that many saints, rishis and munis (mostly men) visited Vrindavan in the form of gopis (female cowherds) so that they could rejoice in Krishna's presence.\n\n4) one of the most revered forms of Shiva is the Ardhanareshwor, where he is depicted as half male and half female.\n\n5) Kamasutra, the divine book which shows ways to enjoy the Kaamyog part of the grihasta jeevan (worldy pleasures of home/family/couple life) clearly has many depictions of all forms of sexual companionship, I mean the book can make the french blush.\n\nThese are just a few examples of transgenders, gender fluidity, and existance and acceptance of same sex couples that I can think just off of my head in our religion. Not to mention that since this community is given the status of the Heavenly Host, the Devasena, they are given a very revered position in our religion. So your reasoning for not supporting the community for religious reasons because you are a Hindu is crap. You dont want to do so is a separate issue and I won't comment on that. However no one should be forced to post the way your school isnforcing you to, so I don't agree with that.", "YTA. Hindu  here too. You are homophobic. Some Hindu deities are gender fluid. Kama sutra also refers to it.", "INFO: did your teacher actually call you homophobic, or did she explain how you abstaining would look homophobic? It would be the same if someone deliberately abstained from a Tamil support event. They would be making it known that they do not support their fellow classmates of Tamil descent.

It's a teacher's job to explain that to kids.", "Are you sure that it\u2019s bc you\u2019re Hindu and not because you yourself just don\u2019t like gay people?

In the 1960s, prior to the Loving decision in SCOTUS, interracial marriage was illegal in some states. People have had to go to court (in USA) to prevent various forms of forced Christian prayer in schools. In Texas and probably Florida, parents of intersex children and trans children can have difficulty accessing medical care for their kids. Even access to birth control information required the involvement of SCOTUS. \n\nWhere is Canada with respect to gay rights, religious freedom, reproductive freedom? If gay rights are lost in Canada, I assure you that some of the next steps will be damage to non-Christian religions and restrictions on interracial marriage. While you are at it, look up the death of Savita Halappanavar in Ireland in 2012.

People have preferences.  Are LGBTQ+ phobic of other people's opinions or do they just have different preferences?  The labels everyone tries to put on people anymore is getting extreme.

I did not read into the OP not liking gay people, just dedicated to their religion. Which might be a crutch?
