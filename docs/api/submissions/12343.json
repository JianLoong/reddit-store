She explained that they had taken offence and that they thought the name was too similar to their daughter\u2019s name - Olivia\u2026. She explained they were very angry with us and not willing to speak to us at the moment. I was completely shocked and it\u2019s all been very upsetting. \n\nI\u2019ve spoken to my parents and my other sister who are also very confused by their reaction. My sister-in-law has said to them that they might be willing to allow us to use Oliver as a middle name but if we use it as a first name that that will essentially lead to an end of relationship between us and them. \n\nI don\u2019t feel I have to justify or ask permission for naming my son and feel they are being controlling with double standards. They\u2019ve never asked anyone permission for naming their children, nor have any of my other siblings\u2026 We have different last names and there\u2019s nearly 5 years between their Olivia and my Oliver, not to mention we live in different countries.

If you had to base your knowledge of male names on my family you would conclude that there are four, possibly five on planet earth, whereas there are a wide variety of women's names.

Even if Oliver and Olivia aren't family names, they're both fairly common and very few people are going to think you copied.

My sister is Emily May and I have two cousins, one first name Emma and the other middle name Mae. It's almost as if we have common relatives that our parents wanted to honor through their names? Your brother and SIL are being ridiculous AH's, it's honestly just up to you whether or not the relationship is worth changing your son's name.

The fact that the rest of the family is confused over their reaction to this speaks *volumes.*  They're acting pretty entitled to try to require you to change your child's first name.

Grandpa resulted in the same thing, and so did just yelling \"Hey, Uncle!\"  Finally, we figured out yelling \"Grandpa Tom\" or \"Pop\" would get grandpa to respond.  \"Bubba\" or \"Uncle Tom\" would get my dad and yelling \"Smith\" would get just Tom to respond.\n\ntagging u/ShotPsychology9554", "Especially if they have such little value for the relationship that this would be a reason to have a tantrum and cut contact.
