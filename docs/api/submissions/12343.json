She explained that they had taken offence and that they thought the name was too similar to their daughter\u2019s name - Olivia\u2026. She explained they were very angry with us and not willing to speak to us at the moment. I was completely shocked and it\u2019s all been very upsetting. \n\nI\u2019ve spoken to my parents and my other sister who are also very confused by their reaction. My sister-in-law has said to them that they might be willing to allow us to use Oliver as a middle name but if we use it as a first name that that will essentially lead to an end of relationship between us and them. \n\nI don\u2019t feel I have to justify or ask permission for naming my son and feel they are being controlling with double standards.
