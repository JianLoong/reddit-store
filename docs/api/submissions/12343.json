She explained they were very angry with us and not willing to speak to us at the moment. I was completely shocked and it\u2019s all been very upsetting. \n\nI\u2019ve spoken to my parents and my other sister who are also very confused by their reaction. My sister-in-law has said to them that they might be willing to allow us to use Oliver as a middle name but if we use it as a first name that that will essentially lead to an end of relationship between us and them. \n\nI don\u2019t feel I have to justify or ask permission for naming my son and feel they are being controlling with double standards.

How self absorbed can these people be ?  \nMaybe break bread by inviting them over for a movie fest and include all movie/ TV titles with the name Oliver lol. Oliver!, Oliver Twist, Oliver and Company, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, Jamie Olivers food revolution, Jamie Oliver together etc...", "NTA - this is so crazy that it seems that they were looking for a reason to be mad at you.  This is just their convenient, all be it ridiculous, excuse.", "NTA. Let them be mad. It\u2019s their problem. They\u2019re being ridiculous and weirdly possessive of a name they didn\u2019t even use, it\u2019s just similar to their child\u2019s name. They\u2019re gonna have to get over it lol.", "NTA. Can you imagine the sht she puts your poor brother through? You should ship him a bottle.", "NTA\n\nThey're acting so petty! They're not even the same gender. \nJust reading that made me tired. \nIt's not on you, it's on them. They don't get to allow you anything. Don't give in. If they cut contact, they weren't worth your time.", "NTA. Brother must be a very weak man to let his wife walk all over him like that.  I have no doubt whatsoever that SIL is the root of all this.  OP, Keep the name you chose and don\u2019t be bothered by their threat, real or not, of cutting you out as that seems the best and smartest thing to do anyway.  Good riddance.", "nta.  makes me wonder if sis and bil had originally planned to call a son that. maybe they wanted olivia to be oliver.", "That\u2019s my dogs name you can\u2019t use it", "NTA. Wowza, they are being very rude and unfair", "NTA I don't think you're missing out on much of a relationship. There is no reason at all why you should be expected by anyone to change your child's name. You could have named your child Olivia and they still have no say-so what-so-ever in the matter. You didn't choose a damaging name or an embarrassing name, you chose a perfectly good name and they're acting like spoiled bratty children.", "I have 2 cousins with the same unique name (family last name). They are big name and little name. No one in my family thought it was weird", "NTA\n\nMy family had two cousins w/similar names and age difference, it was never an issue for us kids. Fairly positive it wasn't an issue for the parents, but honestly, I have no idea.", "My uncle and his youngest kid have the same name. It is normal even for people who are close to each other. NTA", "NTA, just be thankful that you don't live close by or it would have been an outright war.  I am sure that your SIL is an absolute gem to be around.  LOL  Ignore their asshole selves and enjoy your new baby \"Oliver\".  I love his name!", "Oliver your face", "NTA\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that sometimes it is about timing, and what others perceive. My SIL is a bit of a pill. She is older than my wife, and jealous. Of. Everything. That nearly split apart her family. I am working in a relatively decent career field, with tons of time off, decent pay, benefits etc. Her husband... well they are still on welfare.  Her best job position was working at a day care. \n\nThen one day, wife tells the family she is pregnant. Not a few months later, so is SIL. First is born, and somehow, mysteriously their first carries a name so very similar to ours. Not much different than Oliver and Olivia. Owing to the gender difference as well. My wife had been driving a rather old, decrepit 2 door car - so we replaced it with a nice new Subaru Legacy. SIL doesn't have that kind of money - but come Tax Return Day, she runs out and buys herself a new (to her) car. Then comes child #2 - about 3 years later... and within months of \"Hey - round two is coming!\" SIL is suddenly pregnant again. And again, with similar names.\n\nThis sort of thing has gone on for over a decade now. And it isn't just new things, or children. This happens with vacations (where she has to leave children behind to be able to afford them), other major purchases, even buying a home! With it only stopping when her husband threatened divorce. It was a jealous competition that only she was having. \n\nNow - the point is - weather you notice it or not, other people see coincidences like this. And with enough of them, start drawing conclusions. Right, wrong, or otherwise. By all means, name your children as you see fit. Just keep in mind perceptions, and why people may think what they do. It may be worth trying to have a conversation over where name decisions are coming from.", "NTA. My goodness, how entitled can they be? This is ridiculous. I know so many families where multiple family members have the same name. I share a first name with three other cousins of my generation. (Kind of makes it confusing at family gatherings, but whatever!) And you aren't even talking about the same name - you've got different name, different genders, different ages, and even different country of residence! You definitely did nothing wrong and anyone willing to break off a family relationship over something this silly probably isn't worth having in your family anyway.", "NTA", "NTA  Their attitude is ridiculous and they don't sound worth worrying about whether they go NC or not.  \n\nMy sister and I have partially overlapping names with our first cousins (i.e. one has a first name and the other the same middle name) - no one asked anyone's permission, we are all named after the same people and no one took any offence.   \n\nI know some parents do put a lot of stock in being \"original\" with their names, but Olivia is currently the top female baby name listed on the Social Security (US) page.  So they can hardly complain about it not being unique to them or about someone having a similar name.", "NTA. Your brother and SIL are wildly entitled and immature.", "NTA and no, you do not have to justify or ask another family member for permission on what you name your child/s.\n\nIs this the only time they've acted like entitled juveniles? LOL Getting that worked up over a child's name Olivia and Oliver, which are 2 entirely different names is a bit bizarre.\n\nIf this is how they want to act and treat you and yours, I don't think I'd shed any tears. You have a full life and sounds like the rest of your family is great. Go with that and eventually when they see and hear everyone not catering to them, they'll likely come back around. I sure wouldn't put forth any more effort until I got an apology for outlandish behavior.", "Not the asshole and \"they might be willing to allow\" almost made me fall over laughing. Who do they think they are?", "My sister named my niece Olivia. My brother named his son Oliver. They are a few months apart in age. There is no confusion. The names aren\u2019t too similar.

You're definitely NTA.", "NTA I share my first name with 3 of my cousins. First and middle with one of them. Why anyone would care about something like this is so far beyond me.", "Your brother and his wife are clearly the assholes in this situation. Their response is childish and irrational.", "NTA. They sound ridiculous...", "Oliver it is \u2b50\ufe0f", "YTA, it is weird for cousins to have such similar names. Children within large families deserve to have some self identity. Difficult to do that if relatives are mixing up their names. It comes off intentional that you did this in a weird competition way. It may seem illogical to outsiders but family can hold family to higher standards, which it seems you failed to meet.", "Nta - or what, they cross country borders to come and make you? Get wrecked haha.\n\nWelcome baby Oliver! \ud83e\udd73", "NTA. My husband has a full-brother and a half-brother and they both have daughters with the exact same name/spelling. No one owns a name", "my friend expected a weirder name and is disappointed this felt like clickbait but it means you're NTA lol", "NTA.  They are being adult brats. The only way you can be AH with names if you stole it before their child was born knowing that was what they had picked out.", "NTA I have the same name as one of my cousins (we are not Greek). I like the name, I assume both our mothers liked the name as well. We are 7 years apart, and have different last names. Neither of us use nicknames, no one ever confuses us, no parents ever fought or got made.

Their reaction is so bizarre, like whacky rom-com characters that are there purely for laughs.\n\nThere are several actual name double-ups (not like this Oliver/Olivia nonsense) on both sides of my family, which are managed by using nicknames. It's not that hard.", "I have a very very unique name. Nature based, think something like Ocean. A cousin almost named his kid the exact same name as me (I was already like 13) for some reason because they really liked it but my aunt talked him out of it. Now their girl has a very very beautiful name that similar to autumn. Suits her really well. It would have been pretty weird if they went ahead with it I'm not gonna lie. If it was a common name no one would have cared, we have like 4 girls in the family with the ends of their names or middle names being Anna. Common names are fair play but I do feel unique names should be treated with a bit more caution.
