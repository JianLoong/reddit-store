She explained that they had taken offence and that they thought the name was too similar to their daughter\u2019s name - Olivia\u2026. She explained they were very angry with us and not willing to speak to us at the moment. I was completely shocked and it\u2019s all been very upsetting. \n\nI\u2019ve spoken to my parents and my other sister who are also very confused by their reaction. My sister-in-law has said to them that they might be willing to allow us to use Oliver as a middle name but if we use it as a first name that that will essentially lead to an end of relationship between us and them. \n\nI don\u2019t feel I have to justify or ask permission for naming my son and feel they are being controlling with double standards. They\u2019ve never asked anyone permission for naming their children, nor have any of my other siblings\u2026 We have different last names and there\u2019s nearly 5 years between their Olivia and my Oliver, not to mention we live in different countries.

Sometimes you luck out and it's a slightly different spelling, but mostly it's a guessing game of 'which Kathleen is that? The one that's married to Michael, or the one whose son is Michael? Brigid's niece? Daughter? Ohhhhh, the one who moved to Navan, right.'", "Oliver and Olivia don\u2019t even register as similar in my mind. I am one letter away from a very popular name, and I genuinely never think about how they are similar even when I meet people with that name. It doesn\u2019t register. \n\nNTA", "Nta. Unbelievable: totally Nta  and that's  how they treat a post partum family member and a wee little new nephew.", "NTA Oliver is a great name. Your baby, your choice.", "NTA - And if that's all it takes for them to go no contact, they aren't much of a loss.", "Sounds like they've lost their minds", "NTA. Hubby's grandmother was Olive. He has a cousin named Olivia, and one of the other cousins named her son Oliver. There was no fighting, no complaining, no issues. Your brother and SIL need to get over themselves.", "NTA.\n\nI don't understand parents who think they own a name. Is this a new thing today? In my family, multiple cousins had the same first names because those names were traditional. In your case, your son's name isn't even the same as your niece's. Your brother and SIL's reaction is ridiculous.", "I have a guess. They only have girls? Were maybe hoping for a boy? Wanted the name Oliver but when their kid turned out to be a girl they named it Olivia instead? I think something more is going on here, not that it justifies how absurd they are behaving. You are definitely NTA, but something tells me you haven\u2019t gotten all the information/reasons behind their reactions.", "NTA. When people get that upset about something that shouldn\u2019t even be an issue know that they\u2019re miserable.", "Tell them bye and to shove their so called relationship up their ass.  I can't even believe some people like that even exist. Wtf", "\"Allow,\" lmaooooooooooooooo.\n\nNTA. I hope Olivia hears about this one day and fills her parents in on how few damns she has available for that brand of crazy.", "\u201cThey might be willing to let you use the name\u2026.\u201d  How generous of them.  James and John are family names. I have numerous cousins, on my moms side, named James and John.  No Biggie. They don\u2019t own the name and all it\u2019s derivatives. \n\nNTA.", "It\u2019s the \u201cmight\u201c that pushes it into insanity level entitlement for me.  Seriously, if a family member uttered the words \u201cthey might be willing to allow,\u201d about something like this, I don\u2019t think I would make it to the end of the sentence without my head exploding.    \n\n\nIt would definitely make me dig in.", "Name that boy Oliver Olivier-Olivine", "I read this and started singing Name Police instead of Dream Police \ud83e\udd23 I love it", "My husbands family has 3 Christophers, 2 Davids, 3 Kathys \n\nThese are cousins that live in separate countries. Who tf cares? NTA", "I have 5 Roberts 3 Emilys 2 Peters 2 Richards and twins in the family with similar names who both had boys a month apart and called them henley and harley and theres 2 couples of both an emily and a richard its not that confusing and doesnt bother anyone if anything its slightly funny when you call one of them over for something and all of them appear", "Brother*", "Wait til they realize there's a food called olives too trying to steal the spotlight.  I'm sure they will be very upset that they don't own the letters \"oliv\" in that particular order.", "They're crazy OP! It's a different gendered name for a different gender baby and both names are also incredibly common to boot. \nThey cannot control what you choose to name your baby.", "NTA - tell the his full name is Oliver Olivia Octavius Olive Spencer Rodriguez the Fourth, Grandmaster and Light of the Far North, King of the 7th Sea and Lead Java Programmer, Esquire.", "I was waiting to see the comment. Now if his name was Olivier?! Okay then. NTA.", "My sister named her son Oliver and then she had a daughter two years later and named her Olivia.", "Olivia is literally the number #1 name on many popularity lists, and has been for a couple of years. \n\nI'd say calling it extremely popular is even an understatement. I like the name but once I saw how common it was, we went a different direction for our daughter.", "\"It's so gracious of them to maybe allow me to name my own child. Tell them I might forgive them for their deluded request after my son Oliver has his own son Oliver Junior.\"", "Oh ya me too\n\n\"Allow\" okay well just so you know I died on this hill, buy some flowers and put a gravestone, cause I am never moving off this hill", "Yep. I was one of 4 with my name in multiple classes. My niece is one of 5 in her class with the name same. Pretty much when they call out my first name my automatic reply is \"which one?\" Until they remember to include the first letter of the last name.", "That\u2019s certainly possible, but still doesn\u2019t excuse SIL\u2019s behavior even if that was the case. How was OP supposed to know that the name was \u201coff limits\u201d if it had never been brought up before? As it stands, OP is totally NTA and SIL needs to calm down and let it go.", "It's reminding me of that scene in My Big Fat Greek Wedding where all the cousins were named the same thing. https://www.google.com/search?q=my+big+fat+greek+wedding+introducing+the+family&rlz=1C1RXQR\\_enUS1033US1033&oq=my+big+fat+greek+wedding+introdu&aqs=chrome.0.0i512j69i57j0i22i30l4j0i390l4.4400j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:f15870cd,vid:5JkQvRdvhG8", "Tell them you are changing the name. Don\u2019t tell them you are changing it to Olivier", "Oh, totally. SIL can't claim ownership of the name Oliver. An explanation of why the name might be bringing up bad memories/ feelings doesn't excuse her behavior. Especially since she never communicated the reasoning to OP. And the whole \"Oliver is too close of a name to my daughter Olive\" isn't a good enough reason to try and prevent OP from using the name. They don't live near each other, rarely see each other, and it seems they don't talk very frequently, so why should she care? SIL is making a non-issue into an issue. \n\nAnother thought that just popped into my head.  What if SIL had a super close male family member, like a brother, uncle, dad, grandpa, etc, that had passed away. They didn't have a son to name Oliver after the beloved family member, so they went with Olive for their daughter. SIL is upset because she feels cheated out of getting to have a son named after her family member and had to settle with a daughter. Now her nephew will be a constant reminder of this disappointment. OP wouldn't know about this because it isn't OPs family.", "lol I have 3 female cousins in my state, one in another state, and 2 more in Italy (all first cousins) all  with the same first name...yes it can get a little confusing at family functions, but it's also fun"]}
