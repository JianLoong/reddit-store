I didn\u2019t understand why as it was a short message and didn\u2019t explain anything- just that they were angry about his name. Since they wouldn\u2019t speak to me I rang my sister. She explained that they had taken offence and that they thought the name was too similar to their daughter\u2019s name - Olivia\u2026. She explained they were very angry with us and not willing to speak to us at the moment. I was completely shocked and it\u2019s all been very upsetting. \n\nI\u2019ve spoken to my parents and my other sister who are also very confused by their reaction. My sister-in-law has said to them that they might be willing to allow us to use Oliver as a middle name but if we use it as a first name that that will essentially lead to an end of relationship between us and them. \n\nI don\u2019t feel I have to justify or ask permission for naming my son and feel they are being controlling with double standards. They\u2019ve never asked anyone permission for naming their children, nor have any of my other siblings\u2026 We have different last names and there\u2019s nearly 5 years between their Olivia and my Oliver, not to mention we live in different countries.

That reaction isn\u2019t normal, I can only wonder what their real issue is, it can\u2019t be the name? They\u2019re making demands they have no authority to make and giving ridiculous ultimatums.

They said they might \"allow\" you to use it as a middle name. Since when did you need \"their\" permission to name your own child? Did they ask for permission to name any of their children? I bet the answer is no. Name your children what you feel is right. Congratulations on your new little one.", "NTA. You wouldn't even be the AH is you had used the same name - it wasn't that long ago that people would expect to have cousins with the same name. People would often go by Mary Anne, Mary Jo, etc. because there were no many Marys. Or multiple cousins named John. It's only fairy recently that people have come to expect that the name they choose will be unique in the extended family. But this is merely a similar name, not an identical name.
