However, she returned back from seeing her family over Christmas and pretty soon stopped spending the night in my room. She was sleeping in my brothers room. I asked why and she said she had to work with the light on at night and didn\u2019t want to bother me. I understood and let it go.

The more \"normal\" reaction would be to be happy to have regained some privacy (including the bathroom), but instead you 're all offended.\n4. Why do you treat your brother's room like a shrine? Did your brother pass (if so, my deepest condolences, but you didn't mention anything of that kind)? Otherwise this whole thing doesn't make any sense to me.\n5. Did anyone ask your brother if he's okay with her occupying his room? Will he eventually move back in?\n\nESH except your dad. You seem weird for making this into a problem, and your friend is rude for just taking over a room w/o discussing it beforehand.\n\nEdit: spelling", "INFO Why wasn\u2019t she offered the guest room to begin with?

YTA only if you take it personally.\n\nEdit - additional thought:  Don\u2019t let this breed resentment.  You supported her with your Dad to move in. Are feeling left out now that she wants another room?  You might find your friendship strengthened given a little space.", "NTA if you offered her the guest room. It\u2019s a bit weird that you didn\u2019t offer her the guest room to begin with though, why was that?", "YTA your dad was reluctant but you pressured him into allowing her to come, now you only want her there on your terms.  Get over yourself and let her have her own space and time.", "INFO: has your brother died? You way you're phrased this (e.g. \"preserving his memory\") makes it sound like he's dead but earlier on you say they've moved abroad. Just wanted to clarify.", "Yeah, kinda YTA. Did your dad have a problem with it or just you?", "A very soft for YTA for the mere fact that it sounds like this home has a few open bedrooms and you didn\u2019t offer her her own room to begin with. It makes sense she wanted her own personal space", "YTA\n\nThe sole justification that seems to come up in this comments is that you have a *feeling* that she is \"taking over\" your brother's room, which you are bizarrely possessive of.\n\nFirst, your brother's room is not *your* room.\n\nSecond, your father's house is not *your* house.\n\nThird, what does that even mean - taking over the room? She's staying there because she needs to sleep somewhere. It's not somehow becoming *her room* and in any event it sounds like your brother moved out long ago. Her temporarily staying in his room is not doing anything to your \"memories\" of him.\n\nFourth, surely you know the source of this odd feeling.

It sounds like she is being considerate and a pretty good houseguest.", "YTA. Your brother moved out. Why is it an issue that she uses his room?", "YTA. It's strange that she was not offered the guest room to begin with. Kind of weird having multiple empty rooms available and expecting her to share a room with you. I'm sure she already felt like an imposition asking for help. She was only trying to be polite and move to a room where she would not bother you. All of this could have been avoided if she was given the guest room.", "INFO: What does your dad think?", "Should of been the guest room from the beginning.

You come across quite controlling and territorial.", "YTA   Your brothers room isn't in use and she does still needs to have her own space and some sense of privacy.

I get that brother isnt there but brother would probably  be mad on his return if a random person is in his room without being spoken to first. The preserving his memory thing is weird as heck, it's also not your house. You pressured dad into letting her stay then want her to stay in your room only?\n\nYou keep dodging the question of why she wasn't put straight  into a guest room in the first place. Undergrad  indicates late teens, early 20s? Even if you were ok with sharing, she might want her own space. By that age I definitely would prefer not to be sharing, especially if there's several empty bedrooms.", "Technically if your brother still has his things there and visits its his room and she could've just go to the guest room from the start of moving in I would like to know your dad's opinion about this but I think NTA.

She's not visiting you; she didn't move in to bond with you or live an endless slumber party. Instead, she's living with your family while she establishes herself in a new job in a new city, and saves up some money for her own place.

If you invite someone to stay with you and you have different options to offer where they can sleep and feel most home, you ask them, you don't just assume.\n\nI find it really off-putting how unwelcome you seem, OP. I'd feel really unwelcome with your attitude of her usage of an empty shower no one was using, because you miss your brother. And then you singlehandedly dictate where this guest can and can't sleep, because you miss your brother. \n\nBut in general, I'm truly baffled by this sort of need, that when grown children move out, their rooms turn into sort of shrines that cannot be touched in case the child comes to visit. You take it to the next level with the shower thing, though.", "She never said she was uncomfortable.

And now you\u2019re trying to make it sound like a reasonable assumption, which it\u2019s not.", "How does your dad feel about it? But IMHO you dictating which shower she can use comes across controlling.\n\nI'm also curious, why did you have her move into living in your room in the first place and didn't offer her the guest room? The guest room would've been the most logical room for her.", "So if my assumption is not logical and OP didn't offer the brothers room, than the only other possible situation is that she moved into the brother's room with no conversation with anyone who lives in the home.

And your brother doesn't need to be dead for you not to want someone messing around on his space and his things.\n\nNTA, but you should probably clear the air, she was most likely uncomfortable with having to share a room when there was no need, which might be why you two didn't get along, so just say that you didn't realize how she was feeling about sharing, give the reason why you and your dad made that choice and say that while you understand why she wanted her on space that she shouldn't have done things that way and should have just spoked to you/your dad.", "You not having issues sharing the room doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t. \n\nIt seems like you have some issues with unhealthy attachments/boundaries.

And you seem to be causing a fuss because this friend isn\u2019t establishing the kind of relationship you want, even though the reason for her moving in was not so you could have a replacement sibling. \n\nAre you in therapy?  Because this seems unhealthy, it seems like you\u2019re treating these people as if what you want from them is more important than their own lives.", "Have you explored those feelings? \n\nWhat does taking over signify for you? Is it feeling like then your brother won't come back or triggering feelings of loss? Or is it that you wanted her in your shared space, as that is something you are familiar with, so her \"taking over\" is more about you not controlling her or her not fitting into your expectations of what she should do and how your relationship should be? What emotional soothing does preserving your brother's room give you?\n\nIt seems like you may have some attachment issues, as well as some communication issues.

Friend is your father's guest not yours. Her wish for privacy while working and a room of her own is normal. Her using a different room to work at night is considerate.

What about your mom?", "Where does it say they PRESSURED dad to let her stay? She told him she didn't mind. That's NOT pressuring her dad ffs. Honestly how do people twist things like this?", ">I told him I didn't mind **and it was** ***necessary*** **we helped her in any way we could seeing as she didn't have a dad anymore**\n\nIn the same sentence as the part where OP says she told him she didn't mind. That IS pressuring her dad ffs. Honestly how do people fail at reading comprehension so badly like this?", "Missing her brother whom she was closest to, is hardly an obsession!", "No but wanting to keep his bedroom as a shrine to him is."]}
