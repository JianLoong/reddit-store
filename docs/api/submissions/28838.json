We never really followed it- maybe in the beginning when we first got it because he decided after being out of her life for almost a year when she was 5 that he wanted full custody, the courts basically said yeah right but here\u2019s 40%. She goes over every weekend. As she got older we got looser with it. And we coparented really well together. Between his then gf now wife (Casey 35F), my husband (32M) and Tim we all helped each other. When they worked crazy schedules their daughter (12F) would stay the night at my house, I\u2019d take her to school. I spent so much time with her that she was/is really apart of my family. The relationship between Tim and Casey ended for about a year, during which they relied on us even more. Tim works a government job and had to leave from time to time (once during the holidays so I helped him fly home for 24hrs as a Christmas gift to them). Once they got back together Tim got a hair in his ass about moving to the countryside an hour away because it was \u201csafer\u201d than our city. (It\u2019s meth city out there mind you). I tried to tell him it wasn\u2019t smart because she was getting older and will want to have a social life and that he\u2019ll miss important events like soccer games and such. Well a couple years later- he\u2019s missed many games- missed many weekends- went no contact for about a month- blamed her saying she doesn\u2019t respond (she showed me the texts.)-  Liz had a really stressful month with being super involved in high school clubs, soccer and socializing. Sometimes she feels guilt tripped by Casey and Tim. And gets upset saying she\u2019s a bad daughter for doing what she would be able to do if they stayed in town. She had two performances this month with two different clubs, she had soccer games, practices, (mind you she was gonna quit soccer this year and her dad pressured her to do it- she came up with dance as an alternate sport and he told her it didn\u2019t count as a sport so she continued with soccer) she\u2019s a great dancer and it\u2019s really like it comes to her naturally when she performs- but because Tim decided to selfishly move an hour away did he make any of her performances? Nope. And getting him to even go to her games is hard. He\u2019s a wishy washy dad over the last few years and I\u2019m tired of making excuses for him so I\u2019ve told her not to feel bad for being a normal kid and dads \u201churt feelings\u201d is his own issue because he decided to move away. (He won\u2019t drive to town late, so she\u2019s missed football games, he expects her to get her license and drive to him in the next couple years. at 15.5 she can get a job and she feels like she can\u2019t cuz she has to be gone on the weekends with her dad.) Before I would tell her she has to go because we have the court order and stuff and I can\u2019t keep her from him. But now I refuse to tell her she can\u2019t be a normal kid because her dad has custody of her too.

This is common situation when kids get into high school, which is why many courts allow children to choose at that age.", "NTA.  She is 15 and should have a say with whom she lives, when and where she visits, and on these issues be deferred to unless specifically overruled by court order.   In the US, most courts are required to consider a child's preference in custody issues.  Even though no court has issued a ruling in your case, your choice would likely be validated if the custody issue every came up in court again.", "The child should say all this of this, if it is how she feels, to him.  Putting the ball in his court.  He can make the effort to be a part of her life but it is not right for him to expect for her to give up anything because it is inconvenient for him..also,  by her age, she should be able to legally choose where she wants to spend her time or not.", "You can't unilaterally ignore a custody agreement. That will get you in to legal difficulties.\n\nYou and Tim are free to agree on other arrangements, and that's fine, but you can't just unilaterally decide that she's not going to him this weekend. \n\nThe first thing I would do is find out what the norm is for custody arrangements for children of your daughter's age in your state. How much choice and control do courts usually give the kids?\n\nYou and your daughter have reasonable points - she wants to get a job at the weekends, like other kids. She wants to hang out with her friends, like other kids. And whilst Tim is free to choose where he'd like to live, taking her away from her friends every weekend is sucky.\n\nThe you have a choice - either you can agree other arrangements with Tim privately (that's an agreement he could revoke at any point, but if you're being civilized, he won't), or you can go back to court and ask for the agreement to be adjusted. Given that he's moved away, and she's 15, it wouldn't be unreasonable to have the arrangement changed to something more like one weekend a month plus vacations.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Courts sometimes don\u2019t appreciate a parent not encouraging their child to go on their visits, especially when the reason is just distance and not mistreatment. They aren\u2019t abusing her, they aren\u2019t providing a bad home environment, they just live an hour away which is really not that big of a deal (though that cuts both ways - he should make more effort, this is essentially his selfishness causing the problem!!).  I\u2019d be proactive and go back to court and move to modify the agreement to reflect the reality of the new circumstances. See if you can add language requiring him to facilitate her extracurriculars and handle the transportation for visits. I\u2019d also see if they\u2019ll let you reduce the visitation. This is assuming you can\u2019t find some agreement if you approach it in a more mediation/formal \u201cwe have a problem\u201d sort of way.\n\nBut yeah, I wouldn\u2019t push her if I were in your position.
