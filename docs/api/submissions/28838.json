She goes over every weekend. As she got older we got looser with it. And we coparented really well together. Between his then gf now wife (Casey 35F), my husband (32M) and Tim we all helped each other.

The relationship between Tim and Casey ended for about a year, during which they relied on us even more. Tim works a government job and had to leave from time to time (once during the holidays so I helped him fly home for 24hrs as a Christmas gift to them). Once they got back together Tim got a hair in his ass about moving to the countryside an hour away because it was \u201csafer\u201d than our city. (It\u2019s meth city out there mind you). I tried to tell him it wasn\u2019t smart because she was getting older and will want to have a social life and that he\u2019ll miss important events like soccer games and such. Well a couple years later- he\u2019s missed many games- missed many weekends- went no contact for about a month- blamed her saying she doesn\u2019t respond (she showed me the texts.)-  Liz had a really stressful month with being super involved in high school clubs, soccer and socializing. Sometimes she feels guilt tripped by Casey and Tim. And gets upset saying she\u2019s a bad daughter for doing what she would be able to do if they stayed in town. She had two performances this month with two different clubs, she had soccer games, practices, (mind you she was gonna quit soccer this year and her dad pressured her to do it- she came up with dance as an alternate sport and he told her it didn\u2019t count as a sport so she continued with soccer) she\u2019s a great dancer and it\u2019s really like it comes to her naturally when she performs- but because Tim decided to selfishly move an hour away did he make any of her performances? Nope. And getting him to even go to her games is hard. He\u2019s a wishy washy dad over the last few years and I\u2019m tired of making excuses for him so I\u2019ve told her not to feel bad for being a normal kid and dads \u201churt feelings\u201d is his own issue because he decided to move away. (He won\u2019t drive to town late, so she\u2019s missed football games, he expects her to get her license and drive to him in the next couple years. at 15.5 she can get a job and she feels like she can\u2019t cuz she has to be gone on the weekends with her dad.) Before I would tell her she has to go because we have the court order and stuff and I can\u2019t keep her from him. But now I refuse to tell her she can\u2019t be a normal kid because her dad has custody of her too.

How much choice and control do courts usually give the kids?\n\nYou and your daughter have reasonable points - she wants to get a job at the weekends, like other kids. She wants to hang out with her friends, like other kids. And whilst Tim is free to choose where he'd like to live, taking her away from her friends every weekend is sucky.\n\nThe you have a choice - either you can agree other arrangements with Tim privately (that's an agreement he could revoke at any point, but if you're being civilized, he won't), or you can go back to court and ask for the agreement to be adjusted. Given that he's moved away, and she's 15, it wouldn't be unreasonable to have the arrangement changed to something more like one weekend a month plus vacations.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Courts sometimes don\u2019t appreciate a parent not encouraging their child to go on their visits, especially when the reason is just distance and not mistreatment. They aren\u2019t abusing her, they aren\u2019t providing a bad home environment, they just live an hour away which is really not that big of a deal (though that cuts both ways - he should make more effort, this is essentially his selfishness causing the problem!!).  I\u2019d be proactive and go back to court and move to modify the agreement to reflect the reality of the new circumstances. See if you can add language requiring him to facilitate her extracurriculars and handle the transportation for visits. I\u2019d also see if they\u2019ll let you reduce the visitation. This is assuming you can\u2019t find some agreement if you approach it in a more mediation/formal \u201cwe have a problem\u201d sort of way.\n\nBut yeah, I wouldn\u2019t push her if I were in your position.

Maybe that'll make him realize how controlling and stupid he's being. It's not like you're stopping her from going. Does the custody agreement say it's on you to make all the arrangements? I doubt it.", "NTA. Your daughter is old enough to make her own choices. This includes when and how she has contact with her Dad.

I hope that you've documented all of his missed visits and events. If you haven't, start that lost. Hire a lawyer and go back to court.

If she has games, practices, performances, work etc. on the weekends he has custody then he\u2019s obligated to take her to and from these events. If he\u2019s not, he\u2019s failing his daughter. She\u2019s entitled to a life and his choice to make things difficult isn\u2019t her problem. The responsibility lies with him to handle the increased travel time. \n\nBut talk to a custody attorney and get things modified as needed before she can drive and he thinks he can force something on her. Your daughter seems to have some anxiety already. It\u2019s really unfair of her father to put this on her.", "As someone who went through this as a teen, have her petition to the court for a amendment to the custody agreement. If she petitions, even if the court doesn't intervene, it's documented and he can't take legal action against you.

I don't think that a 15 year old can be forced to go if she doesn't want to.

Throw the hole damn couple in the bin!", "It might be simpler now that she's just 3 years away from being an adult. Courts tend to liste to older children's preferences. \n\nOn another note, I cannot understand why some parents insist on forcing their children to spend time with them when they don't want to. One of my parents did that, made me give up a lot of social opportunities at a time when I was struggling to find my footing in the teenage world. My parent didn't care that I was an introvert and it was already difficult enough for me. They wanted to spend time with me strictly on their terms and schedule. They weren't there when I needed them, but I had to give up everything when they wanted me around. Guess who is very LC with said parent decades later? There were other issues, of course, but this controlling approach to \"relationship building\" was what set the tone.", "I should have put it more clearly in the post- I\u2019m not actively ignoring it- I\u2019m just not strongly enforcing it like I did with her. I would always tell her that that was just how it was because we have a court ordered agreement and that I cannot legally keep her from him. But now I\u2019m giving her more option.

I couldn\u2019t imagine FORCING her to spend time with me. I work long days and I\u2019m thankful when she\u2019s home and wants to watch a movie and have dinner. But if she wants to be with her friends or stays at school late for her club practices or like today staying late to work the carnival, going to the football game then going to homecoming after I would never make her pick time with me over that. These are memories she\u2019s building, she and I have built millions of years worth of memories and we still will but these school/social memories matter.", "Yea, I'm going to say a judge will not see it that way. Even I can see how that could be twisted into parental alienation. You need to go to family court with your daughter and have her ask the judge to change the agreement based on her wishes.", "It's great that you're giving her the choice, and treating her like the seemingly mature teenager she is, NTA. GET THE AGREEMENT AMENDED. You and your ex can enforce/not enforce it as much as you want. If he decides to be petty and hurt you by telling the court that you're keeping her from him, which would be technically true according to your current agreement, then you could get into hot water, and he might end up with more custody. The enforcement isn't the problem, it's that based on some of your other comments I've seen, you don't realize how vitally important it is that you LEGALLY COVER YOUR ASS!", "You need to go back to court and adjust the schedule.", "Yeah, I\u2019d get custody changed legally.  What\u2019s the chances now he has a new baby he\u2019s back in regular contact so he can use your daughter as a free babysitter?", "I see that in your posts in this thread and how he put down her dancing which is a sport btw and which brought her joy! He wants her in his life he shouldn't put her down", "Essay? You need to go to court. He sounds controlling.", "Do not keep trying to do this \"outside of the Courts.\" Get it done properly or you would be the asshole.", "She cannot drive herself until she is 16 and gets her license. Having her drive with only a learner's permit and no sober licensed adult riding shotgun is illegal. Make sure that gets documented too!", "In CA a child aged 14 or older gets a say and the Court must at least consider it. She can often even get her own Court appointed attorney to represent her.\n\nMake sure you have documented his no-showing and ignoring her and make screenshots of all texts."]}
