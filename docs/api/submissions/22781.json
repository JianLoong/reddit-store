I then tore into her for about 2 hours over how she failed me as a parent from my toddler years all the way through that moment in my adulthood.\n\nShe was shocked, but it's been almost 2yrs and I've not heard that phrase from her since. Similar thing happened with my older sister in our teen years. She bullied me horribly but would say to me \"oh I'm so ugly / no one would ever love me\". I told her she'd be ugly and unlovable until she finally recognized her beauty and loved herself instead of seeking validation from people. She hated me in the moment but thanked me about 5yrs later when she finally understood what I meant.\n\nIt sounds harsh, but a lifetime of manipulative BS gave me an incredibly short fuse for nonsense that stops a lot before it gets too squirrelly.", ">Of course, if you dont mind the blow ups or drama, feel free to call things as they are.\n\n\n\nOr....or...

You must be super proud.", "NTA. And idk if you've heard the term, but the autistic community has a specific term for parents who so constantly talk about their kid's autism for pity points and moan about how it's just *so hard* being a parent of an autistic kid (often online to strangers while severely violating their kid's privacy and exposing their most vulnerable moments to the world), basically building their whole personality around the *sacrifice* they're making being a ... parent to their kid:\n\nAutism Warrior Moms(/dads/parents).\n\nNote that this is not about a parent in a moment of exhaustion expressing frustration with dealing with a highly disabled kid, looking for support when overwhelmed, etc. The three defining things are that it's constant, that it's never positive (like they literally never talk about enjoying spending time with their kid unless it's inspiration porn type stuff) and it's usually extremely public/to strangers, not to trusted friends or relatives who would keep it to themselves.\n\nAutism Warrior Moms are often more ableist than even the average random ableist. I've seen ones with kids with extremely low support needs even advocating for a cure for autism. They're the ones who often put their kids through ABA to make them more \"normal\" - ABA being something considered \"conversion therapy for autistic people\" by the community (and especially queer autistics) that has literally caused many autistic people to develop PTSD. Many of them are the ones who bought into the \"bleach enemas\" bullshit to \"help with\"/\"cure\" autism.\n\nTheir entire thing is wearing the experience of parenting their autistic child like a badge of honor for the \"suffering\" they act like they martyr themselves to while utterly ignoring and not caring about how it can be a struggle for their *KID* to BE autistic. Some of them even monetize their kid's experiences (nonconsensually, of course). \n\nMeanwhile, my stance has always been that parenting your kid is the bare minimum, and that since any kid can become disabled at any time, that it's important to accept that that might be part of the bare minimum of your job. Obviously needing time to adjust to that reality is a grace that parent caretakers should be given just as much as any caretaker of a suddenly disabled person, and it's absolutely okay for a parent to struggle with it and need help and support from their loved ones and community. \n\nIt's just that pretending to be a martyr for doing their job, even if it *is* in some way set to \"hard mode\", just because they revel in the attention other people give for feeling sorry for them, and painting themselves as a hero for being... *adjacent* to a disabled person who quite literally has to be in their own head/body 24/7, as opposed to a caretaker who can walk away?\n\nIt just bothers me.\n\nIt decenters the person actually experiencing the epicenter of the struggle, often while actively abusing them. \n\nAnyway, my point here is that she's got some red flags of that just in her post alone, the videoing being the most damning one. I sincerely hope I'm wrong, for her daughter's sake.\n\n(Feel free to ask questions. While this subject can be upsetting to me, I've tried to explain it as carefully and emotionlessly as possible, in the hopes that it'll be more clear to more people how this is harmful. This may also be partially a trauma response \ud83d\ude05, as I've dealt with a lot of truly cruel ableists on the internet who will pick apart the smallest hint of an accusatory tone in my words and use it to claim nothing I said was valid - which they would have said anyway, but it still sticks with you.
