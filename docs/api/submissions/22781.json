You didn't bring it up, she did. You agreed with her self-asessment...she was probably fishing for forgivness or for you to tell her some platitude like \"oh it wasn't that bad\" but you don't owe her that. If she apologizes and you accept her apology maybe things could change...but you have no obligation to do so.", "NTA. She was hoping you would say \u201cthere there\u201d and give her soft pats on the back and forgive her years of torment", "Ok. NTA\n\n- she was *checks math* 21/22 when she bullied you at 13. When she sent the video. This was one year before Freya was born. She should\u2019ve known better, if out of being a mature adult alone\n\n- she should be feeling guilty. That\u2019s a good thing.\n\nBut she was only looking for absolution from you for her shitty behaviour. Shitty behaviour she\u2019s continuing. \n\nShe disregarded your emotions in youth, and almost actively relished in your suffering for clout and laughs with her friends. And Now she\u2019s relishing in her daughter\u2019s autism *for internet clout and laugh with her friends*\n\nOnly forgive her when you want to. If her apology was genuine she would\u2019ve understood this. And if your parents had a semblance of intelligence or care, they\u2019d understand this too.\n\nHome sis just don\u2019t like the consequences of her adult actions.", "NTA, what was she expecting just because you apologize doesn't mean you that the person you are apologizing to forgives you.  The fact your parents and she responded like they did means they aren't really all that sorry because they are still thinking of themselves and not you.", "NTA She is probably only apologizing because she has an autistic child and wants pity from others. You just reassured her the truth. I honestly would go no contact or low contact with my family if they treated me this way. They obviously have no care for your feelings or pain.", "The pain you just put her through is a tiny fraction of what she made you endure.\n\nNTA. She asked a question that she didn't want to hear an honest answer to, and you answered it honestly. Which is an autistic trait she should have seen coming.", "NTA what the hell is wrong with your family", "NTA.\nIf she's hurt you're agreeing with what she's apologizing for, she's saying sorry to make herself feel better.", "NTA", "NTA - She sounds exhausting and you should consider minimizing the time you spend with her. And stop following her on FB.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. She wanted sympathy because now she has a kid with autism and she doens't want to see herself as someone who is mean to autistic people. She was seeking a specific response, being absolved of it just so she feels better about her daughter, not just genuinely apologising. \n\nLikewise what kid doesn't know that filming their sister having a meltdown then sharing it around friends to embarrass her is bad. That's cruel behaviour to any sister, autism was the cause of the meltdown, but recording and sharing it had nothing to do with the autism, the idea that she didnt' know any better is just bullshit.\n\nShe was 22 when she shared that video, 22, and wants to pretend she didn't know any better. A 10yr old would know how embarrassing and awful that was to do to family.", "[deleted]", "YTA \n\nWhen someone is apologizing to you, telling you they feel horrible for what they did, etc., it is not a good idea to say \"you should feel guilty.\" (Unless, of course, you want no relationship with them.)\n\nShe already knows that. She does feel guilty. She was doing her best to make amends. Slapping people when they're trying to apologize leaves them not knowing where to go from there.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She\u2019ll have to work real hard to try and balance it more.  Sorry without acknowledging the work needed is meaningless", "NTA, tell your parents that family is a two way street. She never treated you like family, so why should you see her as such? Has she even apologized? Because admitting that you have been horrible is not an apology.", "Where does OP say she laughed with her friends at her own daughter?", "Did I miss something? What question did she ask OP?", "An admitted presumption, but let\u2019s not pretend that the very many, daily Insta posts about how hard it is to be a mom to a kid with ASD is anything but looking for clout and empathy.\n\nMy wording was mostly to draw a parallel, but all those posts aren\u2019t for the kids sake I guarantee you", "It's an implied question; she was really asking for reassurance/sympathy. Which the OP declined to supply, instead answering with the truth.", "I'm shocked you would accuse a mom of laughing at her own child's autism, with no basis at all, especially when she clearly does not think it's amusing. Some people go on social media looking for support/advice. \n\nWow.", "Not laughing at it, read directly above.\n\n\nAnd it\u2019s not baseless. The red flags are there, and while *i repeat* she\u2019s not laughing at her child, she is laughing with her friends, and she is making the posts for attention. \n\nBy 22 personality starts to set rather well, and her behaviour with the apology is already telling enough. She\u2019s doing it for clout, specially with what OP mentioned about the attitude to the posts and timing thereof", "Yeah. \n\nLaura does sound like she was horrible, but people usually make the worst assumptions. And tbh a \"lot\" has changed around autism in the past ten years, so yeah, it's definitely possible she really did think OP was just a brat. It's also possible she didn't recognize the full extent of autism back then.", "Nta, my brothers tortured me growing up and the oldest has since apologized I forgave him and said honestly it wasn\u2019t all your fault, at no point did the actual adults intervene and you were a kid who was basically being encouraged by our parents. I blame the adults for bullying bc if they nipped it in the bud the first time it wouldnt have been an issue. Your sister should feel bad tho, even if you\u2019re a kid you\u2019re responsible for the actions you take against others edit: I guess I didn\u2019t read the ages, I didn\u2019t realize she was fully grown at that stage. Jesus yeah she\u2019s an awful person for that", "NTA\n\nAnd I think, if you feel up to it, you should tell your parents and your sister exactly how you felt for every instance where your family didn't understand your sensory issue, or every time your sister bullied you.\n\nThe reason I suggest this is so they don't treat Freya the same way.", "NTA. i don't buy the \"i didn't know better\" excuse. she knew what she was doing.", "NTA \n\nand you are treating her like family seeing as your family have never respected or even tried to understand and accommodate you.", "Nta.  She needed to hear it from you how you felt and still feel.  You were borderline abused and I feel for your lousy childhood", "I've found it's always best to agree with those self-pity statements because as soon as you do it once, they drop that tactic. The last time my mom ever tried to pull the \"oh I'm just such a bad mom\" card, I replied: \"ACTUALLY, you were, let's dig into that!\". I then tore into her for about 2 hours over how she failed me as a parent from my toddler years all the way through that moment in my adulthood.\n\nShe was shocked, but it's been almost 2yrs and I've not heard that phrase from her since. Similar thing happened with my older sister in our teen years. She bullied me horribly but would say to me \"oh I'm so ugly / no one would ever love me\". I told her she'd be ugly and unlovable until she finally recognized her beauty and loved herself instead of seeking validation from people. She hated me in the moment but thanked me about 5yrs later when she finally understood what I meant.\n\nIt sounds harsh, but a lifetime of manipulative BS gave me an incredibly short fuse for nonsense that stops a lot before it gets too squirrelly.", ">Of course, if you dont mind the blow ups or drama, feel free to call things as they are.\n\n\n\nOr....or... A Hs should either be honest with their \"apologies\" Or shut up. Op was just fine. But if she wasn't ready to hear that her actions were that bad, then she wasn't ready to apologize. \n\nOp doesn't have to Carter to how her bully feels", "No, people who actually want to own up to their mistake and actually make amends don\u2019t throw tantrums when their VICTIM tells them the truth. The sister was clearly fishing for OP to tell her that she wasn\u2019t horrible and that she\u2019ll be a great mother to an autistic child.\n\nOP doesn\u2019t need to cater to or censor herself for her bully\u2019s feelings.\n\nCongrats for coming down on the side of someone that bullied an autistic child for years and years though. You must be super proud."]}
