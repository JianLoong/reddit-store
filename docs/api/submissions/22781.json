And idk if you've heard the term, but the autistic community has a specific term for parents who so constantly talk about their kid's autism for pity points and moan about how it's just *so hard* being a parent of an autistic kid (often online to strangers while severely violating their kid's privacy and exposing their most vulnerable moments to the world), basically building their whole personality around the *sacrifice* they're making being a ... parent to their kid:\n\nAutism Warrior Moms(/dads/parents).\n\nNote that this is not about a parent in a moment of exhaustion expressing frustration with dealing with a highly disabled kid, looking for support when overwhelmed, etc. The three defining things are that it's constant, that it's never positive (like they literally never talk about enjoying spending time with their kid unless it's inspiration porn type stuff) and it's usually extremely public/to strangers, not to trusted friends or relatives who would keep it to themselves.\n\nAutism Warrior Moms are often more ableist than even the average random ableist. I've seen ones with kids with extremely low support needs even advocating for a cure for autism. They're the ones who often put their kids through ABA to make them more \"normal\" - ABA being something considered \"conversion therapy for autistic people\" by the community (and especially queer autistics) that has literally caused many autistic people to develop PTSD. Many of them are the ones who bought into the \"bleach enemas\" bullshit to \"help with\"/\"cure\" autism.\n\nTheir entire thing is wearing the experience of parenting their autistic child like a badge of honor for the \"suffering\" they act like they martyr themselves to while utterly ignoring and not caring about how it can be a struggle for their *KID* to BE autistic. Some of them even monetize their kid's experiences (nonconsensually, of course). \n\nMeanwhile, my stance has always been that parenting your kid is the bare minimum, and that since any kid can become disabled at any time, that it's important to accept that that might be part of the bare minimum of your job. Obviously needing time to adjust to that reality is a grace that parent caretakers should be given just as much as any caretaker of a suddenly disabled person, and it's absolutely okay for a parent to struggle with it and need help and support from their loved ones and community. \n\nIt's just that pretending to be a martyr for doing their job, even if it *is* in some way set to \"hard mode\", just because they revel in the attention other people give for feeling sorry for them, and painting themselves as a hero for being... *adjacent* to a disabled person who quite literally has to be in their own head/body 24/7, as opposed to a caretaker who can walk away?\n\nIt just bothers me.\n\nIt decenters the person actually experiencing the epicenter of the struggle, often while actively abusing them. \n\nAnyway, my point here is that she's got some red flags of that just in her post alone, the videoing being the most damning one. I sincerely hope I'm wrong, for her daughter's sake.\n\n(Feel free to ask questions. While this subject can be upsetting to me, I've tried to explain it as carefully and emotionlessly as possible, in the hopes that it'll be more clear to more people how this is harmful. This may also be partially a trauma response \ud83d\ude05, as I've dealt with a lot of truly cruel ableists on the internet who will pick apart the smallest hint of an accusatory tone in my words and use it to claim nothing I said was valid - which they would have said anyway, but it still sticks with you.

She had a smartphone in her hand to film OP and share it with her equally shitty friends, so why couldn't she use that same smart phone to educate herself?\n\nOP, you are NTA, and by stepping away from your family you've done yourself the biggest favour possible. Judging by you finding out your niece has autism through a FB post, it seems you've gone low contact with your family; keep it that way. Step further away from all of them, for your own mental health and wellbeing. Your parents joining her in mocking you and then declaring that you're not being 'family' just shows that they are as bad as Laura is.\n\nNTA", "It wasn\u2019t a mistake. She is 9 years older then you so by the time she filmed you she was 21. No appropriate, clear-thinking adult would do that. So yes she has to feel guilty", "NTA and you have every right to agree with her. No one is owed an apology. No one needs to be forgiven. Not unless *you* want to and I don\u2019t blame you the least for not accepting her apology. \n\nAlso, what she did wasn\u2019t a mistake. It was bullying through and through. Your sister was probably your first bully and that\u2019s horrible.\n\nYour family and sister are TA in this situation.", "Don't you dare for one second believe yourself to be in the wrong. She wasn't trying to take accountability. She feels as though having an autistic child is some type of cosmic punishment for how she treated you, now she just wants you to reassure her that it isn't. You're NTA just because you actually did what she wanted to pretend to do. Forgiveness comes with accountability. People who don't understand that don't deserve forgiveness.", "She\u2019s still making the mistakes. I have very little respect for anyone who is all over Facebook talking about how difficult it is to be an \u2018autism parent\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s much more difficult to be an \u2018autism kid\u2019, and these children aren\u2019t GIVING their parents a hard time, they\u2019re HAVING a hard time. I\u2019ve been on both sides of this, and I get that everyone needs to vent, but there are SEN parent support groups for that, not your main facebook feed. At that point you\u2019re just an asshole complaining about your kid doing things they can\u2019t help and would probably rather you didn\u2019t shame or expose them for.\n\nNTA Op", "NTA.\n\nShe was a grown adult making fun of a child and sending videos to her adult friends to make fun of a child.\n\nThat isn't a 'mistake' or 'not knowing better' that was her choosing to actively be cruel to you, a child, because of a disability, that you didn't choose to have, and I would remind her and your parents of that every time they try to force you to accept a non-apology.\n\nThough I wouldn't expect any of them to do better, it sounds like your sister and parents are ableist bullies and that isn't likely to change any time soon.", "NTA, she didn't care until it affected her.", "NTA she wanted you to pacify her and tell her it was all okay & no hard feelings so she could stop feeling guilty. You\u2019re in the right. She should feel bad and she hasn\u2019t even really apologised for her actions!", "NTA\nUhm, but you did? You made her feel miserable- you did treat her like family! (At least the way your parents taught you)", "NTA\n  \nThis is going to he another hard lesson for her.\n  \nI don't know if this applies to all people with autism, or only those with Asperger's, but I've learned (both in studying for my degree and through practical experience) that people with Asperger's don't lie.\n  \nI mean white lies. People that are neurotypical can usually tell when someone is fishing for compliments (like your sister was with her little pity party). In response to that, us \"normies\" will usually try to say something nice to make the person feel better, even if it isn't necessarily true.\n  \nA neurodivergent doesn't pick up on those cues, and will answer honestly, even if it hurts your feelings. \n  \nIt is absolutely not done maliciously, and it's not \"brutal honesty.\" It's their lack of guile. \n  \nShe needs to prepare herself for that, because her daughter will be the same way.", "I've got Asperger's and despite my experiences with it, I'm not a diagnostician. But if this sends your sister over the edge, I'm beginning to suspect that Laura might also be autistic.\n\nAlso, what exactt did she expect you to say? You have no obligation to forgive her!\n\nNTA. And your hypocrite parents might be the worst: they *and* Laura used to mock your struggles, so they didn't treat *you* like family either.", "NTA\n\nI'm autistic as well and went though this stuff with my family. \nYou absolutely should let them know you were hurt back then. \n\nYour feelings didn't matter to them then and they clearly don't matter to them now since your sister is using her daughters diagnosis as her own personality trait. \n\nI would distance myself from these people and try to build a connection with Freya (fun enough, my youngest is named Freyja who is also diagnosed) and try to be her security among the rest of the peacocks in the family.", "Your sister wanted you to tell her that she wasn't horrible, it wasn't that bad, when in reality it was.\n\nYou are never an a$$ for telling the truth.\n\nSister was awful to you growing up, and you have every reason to be cool or distant from her. \n\nYour parents want you to make nice due to \"family\" completely ignoring what you endured as a child.  I think that is mentally unhealthy for any victim.\n\nNTA", "> She said I'm being cold and unforgiving and that people make mistakes, and **she didn\u2019t know any better.**\n\nShe \u201cdidn\u2019t know any better\u201d? At the age of 22 years old- over two decades of life on planet earth as a human being- *she \u201cdidn\u2019t know\u201d that an adult bullying a child was an asshole thing to do?* Bull shit. \n\nYour sister is only sorry because now autism actually affects her and something she cares about. She wants you to forgive her because then she won\u2019t have to acknowledge how horrible of a person she was, and still is. \n\nNTA. You do not owe your bully redemption or feeling better. She needs to come to terms with her cruel actions on her own.", "NTA \n\n\nShe is not a bad person just for how she treated you but also for how she\u2019s treating your daughter. I am having an extremely hard time as an adult dealing with my autism diagnosis. I would be mortified if my parents went around advertising it and bringing it up every conversation. I\u2019m not saying that it should be treated like a taboo, but it\u2019s not your sister\u2019s story to tell, it\u2019s her daughter\u2019s. She\u2019s doing a terrible job dealing with her daughter\u2019s autism and if I were you I would somehow make sure that a therapist or a profession hears about this so she can hear from a profession about how she shouldn\u2019t be acting this way.", ">My parents and Laura would always make fun of or get angry at my traits.  \n>  \n>saying I'm not treating her like family.\n\nconsidering how your family treated you all those years, id say you treated her exactly like family! NTA.", "NTA \n\nShe should be ashamed of herself.  Did she expect you to say it was all ok?  If she wanted that response... Frankly she should have asked someone who didn't have autism who might have lied to her for her feelings.  Totally NTA.  She just understands what she did now.", "NTA Admitting you were an asshole isn't an auto pass to blanket forgiveness. Tell your parents you'd actually have to treat her badly for years to treat her like your family treats family.", "NTA she accepted forgiveness and understanding but she's not getting it so she is upset. Sounds like she still has some growing to do.", "NTA.  She was horrible.  She better toughen up cos she\u2019s gonna get a lot more truth bombs from her daughter.  My son has autism, and having been told as a small child (pre diagnosis) that you should always tell the truth, let me tell you, sometimes it can be hard to hear\u2026..there is no grey, just black and white.", "NTA.\n\nLaura STILL doesn\u2019t get autism. Never tell an autistic person a true statement and get mad when they don\u2019t perform the correct social ritual. They\u2019re not gonna do it. \n\nIt\u2019s extremely funny how this is a textbook autism moment and she\u2019s still too up her own ass to figure it out.", "They're doing the same thing they always do. She said something and you agreed with it. There was social subtext there that she expected you to understand, and yet again you've been told you were rude instead of them realising that you're autistic and that social subtext isn't something you find easy to understand. \n\nNTA", "Technically, if you didn't also agree that she was horrible, you'd have nothing to forgive her for. She stormed out of the room before you could even get to step two, which kind of makes it seem like she's still at least a *bit* horrible. \n\nAnyway, NTA. She doesn't want forgiveness, she wants you to say she wasn't that bad and shouldn't be so hard on herself. She wants denial.", "NTA.

And she's still being horrible. Otherwise she wouldn't have thrown a tantrum at what a fairly typical response I would expect from anyone with autism.\n\nShe's making it all about her and she's really making it look like she's going to be one of those autism moms that cares way more about how they look than about the comfort and well-being of their kid. You would think she would want to foster a relationship between an autistic family member and her autistic child.", "Came to say this and had to scroll too far to find it. The autism subreddits, from what I've seen, don't care for those sorts of people at all.", "This is EXACTLY what I thought of when I read about the sister's posts.

She just wanted a clear conscience.  \n\n\nETA: Not sure if second-level judgements count but NTA.", "Yeah. Being frustrated at OP's behavior and becoming emotional at times? Understandable, forgivable with time. Posting a whole ass video with the intention of bullying the OP on a public platform?? Fuck that, that's some malicious bullshit.", "My grandma would do the whole \"I guess no one loves me. I should just leave then\" deal all the time. Manipulated all of her kids and grandkids with that. She was a lovely woman in a lot of ways, but she could be very dramatic. My mom tried that once on me in front of my kids. I said \"okay. Bye then.\" Never happened again.", "I got you.", "I'm still loving how my stepdad pulled this, \"I guess I was a terrible father then!\" and when I didn't correct him, shocked Pikachu face appeared as it dawned on him that I completely agreed with him.\n\nAnd that man was a terrible father and I was not about to pretend otherwise.", "I'm shocked you find some internet randos commentary on the situation more shocking than the situation itself.\n\nWow."]}
