That's actually a great attitude and it does seem like the most rational thing to do for everyone's wellbeing.

Just visit another day. \n\nYour mom just wants to see both her daughters together which is understandable. But if you aren't comfortable then let her know nicely because i understand you care about them and your daughters health too \nI hope things go better! :)", "NTA.

Stick to your guns on this one.", "NTA Your concerns are valid, I understand why you wouldn\u2019t want to stay in a small house with your child.", "NTA. Your reasoning is completely valid, and the guilt trip is unnecessary. \n\n*Maybe* her intentions are good, but it\u2019s no less manipulative to make it about her. You all literally cannot, and **SHOULD NOT** all stay in the same house with a newborn. RSV, Covid, flu, and all kinds of other bugs are flying around right now, and they can be deadly to an infant (I\u2019m sure you know, you\u2019re a mom). \n\nAnd besides, how does your sister feel about this?! The very last thing I would have wanted immediately postpartum, with stitches up, down, left, and right, would be a cramped house full of too many people and no privacy. Those first few weeks can be tough, and hormones would make me a monster in that situation.\n\nYour mom is just not going to get her way, for the safety and comfort of everyone involved.

All you're doing is looking after the comfort of you and your daughter.", "NTA but it\u2019s obvious your mother isn\u2019t just wanting you to visit, she wants all her kids and grandkids in the same place for a little while, that\u2019s a small ask. Just work with her to find a better plan for it.", "NTA \n\nTheir place is not big enough for all of you to stay at. Staying at in-laws is a wonderful compromise. How far away does sister live?", "NTA\n\nThats literally too many people in a small house regardless of the circumstances. You aren't wrong but for some reasons moms always take offense when kids don't want to stay with them. How does your dad feel about this? maybe he can talk to your mom", "Obviously NTA\nCan you stay for at least a day or two at your mom's for her sake?  There's joy in having everyone together, even if it's cramped and noisy. \n\nYou don't have to, you wouldn't be an AH if you chose not to - but it would be an opportunity to create some special memories that just can't be made when you come \"visit\" for a few hours. And it would bring great joy to your parents.", "NTA. They don't have enough space, and all your reasons are good. You are not cutting contact, just keeping the visits shorter. Perfectly reasonable until the baby is older.", "NTA. I wanna sympathize, but there are some things that moms push that are dickish, not needy. Stick to your plan, it makes total sense and hopefully the new parents appreciate dealing with a little less chaos too!", "NTA. Mom is just trying to get her way and being a guilt-tripping baby about it. If you go there and stay at the house like she says, and someone accidentally brings along COVID for the ride, no one's going to be happy having to deal with a sick newborn who may end up hospitalized. Perhaps that'll change her mind.", "NTA.  Your mom is being ridiculous, why isn\u2019t it ok to stay at the in-laws?  It\u2019s their turn. If the place is too small she should be happy that you have an alternative solution. There aren\u2019t even enough bedrooms for everyone", "NTA. As you say, you have no malicious intent and you're trying to look out for everyone's best interests. It's a shame your mother doesn't see it that way, but you're not to blame for that", "Here is the issue, we live in a small town. The hotels are only open here during the tourist season and close from September to March so a hotel is out of the question. Otherwise I would 100% go with this option.", "Our plan is to stay at my in laws who only live about a half an hour from my parents when we visit during this period. We would still see my parents during this period and spending time with them and my siblings we just wouldn\u2019t be staying under the same roof. I thought this is a good compromise but my mother really wants us to stay under the same roof", "She lives at home with my parents, she currently stays in the small box room but will be moving into the bigger room when she gets further along", "Think about how unfair that feels to her though, her home isn\u2019t good or big enough for you to stay in, but your in laws is. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re actually being unfair, but think about her perspective.", "OP is NTA, and her mother is having a hissy fit about it.  Science says OP is exactly right about this, and the mother needs to calm down and focus on other people's feelings here.  It's not about her and yet she's trying so very very hard to make the new baby and the family's new formation all about her.  She's being very immature and throwing melodrama into what could be a happy family occasion if she just stayed calm and recognized that her adult children make adult choices.  In this case, the choices are kind and reasonable.  No need for all the nonsense about who sleeps where.", "Well her place is actually not big enough for that many people now. Someone is going to need to stay elsewhere or they need to buy a house big enough.", "I see what you are saying and understand how that could be upsetting. I\u2019m just really not sure what is the best compromise here. We would immediately go back to saying there once my sister moves out. I have also floated the idea I\u2019d staying at my grandmothers (my moms mom) as she offered but she doesn\u2019t want that either. Any suggestions you have on how to resolve this would be hugely appreciated \ud83d\ude0a", "Relationships aren\u2019t about science or logic they\u2019re about emotion, and even if he\u2019s making the responsible choice which he is. The emotions she\u2019s having are valid, she wants something, she\u2019s told she can\u2019t have it, and other grandma is getting it. Imagine your parents tell you that you can\u2019t have a cookie but your sibling can. Even if they have a good reason it still hurts right? Same principle here.", "Oh I do agree, I\u2019m simply advocating for a softer stance with mom than a hard no.", "Sorry but I have to disagree.  I'm a grandma who doesn't get as much time with her grandchildren as the other grandparents because I live in a small apartment and they have a big house in a wealthy suburb.  Does that hurt?  Yes.  It hurts like hell, but their family is not mine to control or manipulate.  My child has made his choice about how his child/ren will be raised, and I just turn up and spread the love in any way I can, and we have a good relationship and I get to spend time with my granddaughter at their house.  Because, again, it's not about me, and it hasn't been \"me first\" since my child was born.  In the next generation, it's definitely not about me.", "What about the feelings of everyone else in this situation? The mother's shouldn't trump everything. I am sure OP knows the mom wants them all under the same roof- but if it ends up that everyone is uncomfortable, then is it worth it?", "Could you give an example of this. I\u2019m just not sure what you are suggesting?", "I agree with you, I was just asking OP to consider how emotionally this might hurt his mother and giving reason as to why she feels strongly about it. I\u2019m\nNot advocating he change his behavior, I think he\u2019s making the right decision, I just wanted him to consider his mother\u2019s point of view as it often helps when discussing things with the person.", "Genuine question not trying to be mean, how did you read my analogy about denying somebody a cookie for a good reason, and come out with the takeaway that I\u2019m advocating for OP to change his mind? My only goal was to express to OP not that his mom was upset, but WHY and why his In-laws while a logical solution may feel more like salt in the wound to mom. That\u2019s all. I wanted to improve OP\u2019s chances of a successful talk with their mother by lending* an outside perspective to her emotion\u2019s in a way they perhaps hadn\u2019t looked at it. (Does Reddit have their own autocorrect? I swear my phone\u2019s autocorrect goes hyperactive any time I try to type on this app.)", "Truthfully the more of your comments I read the less I believe there is a softer stance to be had, she\u2019s shot down several compromises already.", "Understood.  I appreciate you bringing that perspective to the question.", "I don't think your question is mean. But you said \"think about how unfair that feels to her\" and then said \"her feelings are valid\" - Your cookie analogy didn't come into play in this at all because I honestly don't see how it correlates to this situation.  IMO You were advocating for OP to change their mind by saying OP should come up with a better plan. There is no better plan- OP has offered several compromises that the mother shut down bc of her feelings but is she considering anyone else's feelings in this situation? Notice OP didn't say anything about anyone else because the pushback seems to only be from the mom. Thats why I asked you- are the mom's feelings the only ones that matter here since you are advocating on the side that OP should try to find a way to make staying at the house work", "When I said a better plan, I was referring to one that didn\u2019t involve giving her counterpart (other grandma) what she wanted. Perhaps that\u2019s postponing the trip a bit to make it a family vacation, perhaps that\u2019s renting an air bnb locally for The Whole family, when I said a better plan I meant a better plan, not his mom\u2019s bad plan.", "I think postponing is the better plan tbh. But I feel like if they only go visit the other grandparents then her mom will be mad. It's just all unfair to OP when the mom could just recognize this is a temp situation. i just find it hard to empathize with the mom when she feels like op is \"doing this to her\"", "NTA. \n\nYour mother is making it all about her.\nThis is a good opportunity for her to grow up a little.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry your mom feels slighted by this, but her house doesn\u2019t have the space to host you all comfortably.", "NTA\n\n> My mother is upset that I\u2019m \u201cdoing this to her\u201d\n\nLet her be upset. This part is why I\u2019m judging her as an asshole - she\u2019s acting like you deciding to not stay in her home when you visit is some kind of harm.\n\nIt\u2019s not.\n\nHer reaction may be manipulative, or it may be anxiety/insecurity (where she\u2019s taking it as a sign you don\u2019t love her/don\u2019t want to spend time etc) but it\u2019s still ridiculous to pressure someone to stay with you.\n\nYour explanation shows that your decision isn\u2019t based on punishment.\n\nAnd I would just flat refuse to kick my parents out of their own bed. (Also I like sleep, and does anyone get sleep with a newborn around? Which honestly, is even more reason why people should be sleeping in actual beds not couches)", "NTA. Your mom is being unreasonable. Draw your boundaries and stick to them. The world does not revolve around her.", "NAH, you want to do what\u2019s best for your family and it\u2019s a good mom\u2019s dream to have their kids and grandkids all together. I think you making the right call though. Having everyone together like that will certainly have a lot of unintended negative/annoying consequences/stress for all involved. Best to prevent all of that.", "NTA, that\u2019s just plain boundaries and needs. Don\u2019t sweat it, definitely not the asshole for not wanting to be woken up at 3:00 am by a baby.", "That's because it literally is not big enough. And at least one child's routine will be negatively affected by the other crying/playing. Mom should know by now that life is not fair. She gets to see her children and grandchildren, and even at the same time. Two of them will merely be sleeping at the home of other relatives. She needs to get over it.\n\nNTA.", "> her home isn\u2019t good or big enough for you to stay in, but your in laws is. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re actually being unfair, but think about her perspective.\n\nNot all perspectives are reasonable.\n\nI wonder how it feels for the in-laws that their son and DIL always stay with her parents.", "Your line of thinking prioritizes the health of your child and the newborn, as well as the mental well being of all the adults. NTA.", "Have you talked to your sister about this? I, for sure, wouldn\u2019t want visitors for several days in a crowded space while I was recuperating after giving birth. I don\u2019t know if you are close but going through nursing, bleeding, sleeplessness & trying to learn how to be a parent combined with extended socializing with not only her parents and you but also her brother-in-law and a toddler frankly sounds awful.", "NTA", "NTA - yeah that doesn\u2019t sound practical to all be staying in one crowded house. Be firm but gentle no we are not staying there.", "Nta", "Nta.  You can do dayvisits with your daughter.", "Your mother doesn't think that maybe your inlaws would like a turn of their grandchild staying with them?\n\nSince you always stay at your parents' normally?", "NAH. You\u2019re thinking rationally and showing you care for everyone\u2019s wellbeing. I don\u2019t think your mom is doing anything wrong. She just wants her family all together and doesn\u2019t seem to be thinking of the reality of what that means. Sometimes emotions get in the way of rational thought. Maybe give her some time. I know when I think with emotions, it is hard to get me to see reason. Then when I work through my emotions, I can see things clearer. I hope your mom comes around.", "NTA", "Actually she's just trying to control the situation.  She also probably hates it more that they will be staying with the inlaws.  \n\nShe will see both daughters together at some point.  However they don't have to be staying over night at the same place for that to happen. So your point is moot.", "Are you going to magically make the house bigger? Keep the toddler from picking up something at day care? How much softer can OP get? She's not staying in Argentina, just 30 minutes away.", "Why shouldn't other grandma have them stay too tho? It sounds like up until now they have always stayed with M.", "Yeah, your mom is just being weird on this one. \n\nYou are not refusing to visit, just not sleeping there. Not really sure why that upsets her. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You are being reasonable. Toddlers are germ-magnets.", "NTA\n\nYou are being sensible and rational.  Your mother is not. You're not doing anything to her other than saving her, you, your baby, your sister, and your sister's baby, from an extremely uncomfortable situation in which the babies will be waking each other, no one will get any sleep, no one will have any privacy, and no one will be comfortable.\n\nGo stay with your in-laws.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't house a family of 4 and they're family too. It's just too crazy with young kids. Not to mention, kids need space! If I agreed that's 8 people in my house with 4 kids and not enough beds. \n\nTrust your instincts on this one. And it's not like anybody is out money cuz you have other solutions.", "Nta just be clear to your mom you could do that in the future, just not so young. Or some other compromise, like an airbnb for everyone to have a bed.", "NTA\nSounds like your mother is a control freak. She's demanding that you and your child have a very comfortable stay so she can have you all under one roof? That's unreasonable. Children come first and in this case both babies would be better off if they were staying in separate houses. Just as a side note, your mother doesn't get to dictate to you about where you stay, you could always suggest you don't visit at all if she's insisting on making everything difficult.", "If you\u2019re seeing them anyway, what difference does your daughters daycare make? It\u2019s up to you, but my family sometimes ends up playing musical beds. It\u2019s not a big deal to us. Soft YTA.", "But she\u2019ll sue the family and baby presumably with her daycare-attending daughter in tow. That part is a lame excuse.", "Sounds like your mom is excited to have her babies together again under one roof. She is not being realistic that her babies have their own babies plus their partners. Squeezing that many adults plus 1 toddler and 1 newborn into a tiny home would not work. I am proud of you OP for looking at the sleeping arrangements and being pragmatic. You are still going to visit your family.  And your  plan to sleep at the in-laws is perfect. No need.pitch a tent in your parents backyard. I think that'll be the only available space left . NTA", "You\u2019re wonderfully considerate of a new mum OP! Props to you for being self aware, that your child is a loud toddler who may or may not adhere to quiet times. You\u2019re avoiding added stress for yourself, your sister and your parents. You\u2019ve clearly really thought this through! \n\nYou are a wonderful human, your compromise is absolutely wonderful and thoughtful. \nIt\u2019s very clear you care deeply for your family and their comfort, but also ensure comfort for your family unit also! \n\nNTA! But have a chat with your mum and explain its not out of malice to stay with the in-laws, it\u2019s to ensure everyone is comfortable and has space. So new bub can rest in those new baby days (we know how sleepy a freshly born baby is!) and your sister can adjust without pressure. You\u2019re ensuring your parents can provide ample support by being well rested also!", "Sometimes, when children don\u2019t live geographically close to their parents, they would like some 1-on-1 time with the parent(s). Always annoyed me that when I made the 2HR drive to see my mother, I would arrive and mom would say: let\u2019s not eat right away. Your sister will be here shortly.", "NTA. You will have to take care of baby. She tired. She is in pain. She needs alone time. Baby needs changed. You will be expected to be at her demanding to watch baby while she does these things. Get diaper. Change, baby.  I've been there, done that. Big no from me", "NTA but in future, don't tell her things lllike this in advance. Just wait till the actual visit then say \"child is not well so I'll stay with in laws\" or \"don't give up your beds, I'll stay in xyz\", rather than giving her months to whinge about it.", "Do what you need for your child. My grandchildren were born 7 months apart, granddaughter and twin grandsons. When my daughter\u2019s family would visit at times it was crazy, 2 babies 4 adults and 2 dogs in a 1,500 square foot house. Many times I would bring the boys home with me to sleep due to different schedules and being light sleepers. I live 20 minutes away, want an issue.", "NTA.

That said, your decision NTA", "NTA", "NTA. Your mother is manipulative.", "NTA. Your suggestion is very sensible. \n\nMy late mum was exactly the same. She only lived an hour from me but every time I visited she\u2019d pester for me to stay overnight, even when I had to be at work by 7am the next day. She had old mattresses stored in the garbage and had plans on how 8 people could sleep in her tiny house. She even tried to put her brother in bed with my dad once! \n\nWhen we went on holiday with mum and dad (as adults) she\u2019d try to get as many of us in the same room as possible, often splitting up married couples and having all the men together and the women together. We always pushed back and she rarely got her way. I got married in a hotel and we were all staying there the following night. She tried to have me sleep with her and my sisters! She thought me quite unreasonable that I\u2019d want to spend my wedding night with my husband!", "NTA. Sounds like your mother might have some control and/or emotional manipulation issues. I imagine she is like this in many other areas, so setting boundaries and staying with your in-laws seems like a solid move.", "NTA. Your mother wants to see all of her family gathered around her, which is understandable, but it just is not practical. Something to consider: the newborn really should not be around many people at all because the immune system will not be developed enough.

Too many individuals under one roof, two < 1 year old's, yeah, that's recipe for disaster.\n\nGet a hotel room, airbnb, whatever you can afford.
