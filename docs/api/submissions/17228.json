I learned my lesson early on about asking her to babysit. She would either tell me yes and cancel at the last minute or get mad at me for asking. \n\nNow, this by itself wouldn't be a huge deal. However, my mother was the kind of mother who would drop us off at our grandparents all the time. Holidays, we would get dropped off the second day off and picked up 3 days before school started. We spend every weekend with them. Grandma would pick us up from school and make us lunch.  And besides that, every time one of us asked her to babysit, she said, \"I already raised my kids. \". Even if we were just asking her to keep an eye on the kid while we hopped to the store. So it really is the hypocrisy that gets me, not her not babysitting. I couldn't care less about that. \n\nSo my sister had her first kid about  4 months ago. We had a family dinner on Friday where everyone got to meet the baby. \n\nSo we were all mingling, and my sister asked mom at one point if she could watch the baby on Friday for one hour so she could pick up her MIL from the airport. My mom started to say her usual sentence, and my brothers and I jumped in and finished the sentence for her and laughed. My brother then offered to watch baby. We thought it was over, but mom was offended and went on a long rant about disrespect.  My sister was confused and said, \" I just thought you might want to bond with your granddaughter,\" to which I said, \"She didn't even raise us. What makes you think she would want to spend time with our kids?\". I admit I was mad. Because she was acting like she was that martyr who never had time  for herself. When she literally never had us and when she did, my older brother and I took care of everything in the house. Including childcare and house stuff.\n\nObviously, my mother got furious, saying that I was ungrateful. My older brother intervened \nAnd said that we weren't ungrateful , but we couldn't ignore the matter of fact.\n\n\nThe fight escalated, and my mother stormed off. \nMy father called us and told us it was entitled to shame mom for not babysitting. \nAre we the assholes?", "created_utc": 1684085418, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hi46p/aita_for_shaming_my_mother_about_not_taking_care/", "score": 967, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're not asking her to take weekends, school breaks etc, you've asked for basic help that any normal parent would be willing to provide. \n\nI see other people's point by saying she's not *required* to babysit her grandkids, but if she was a decent person she would.

NTA. I am sorry for your kids and your nieces/nephews who will not get to experience a great and bonding relationship with at least one of their grandparents since your mother is too selfish to decide those relationships are important to her.

You can\u2019t just pretend they don\u2019t matter until you decide they do matter. It sounds like you and your siblings all got it figured out and she deserved to be called out imo. Maybe it could have been said after she left the room or the gathering to spare her feelings, but I can\u2019t say I wouldn\u2019t have done the same thing in your shoes lmao so I can\u2019t really judge you for not holding your tongue.", "NTA i am 47f and my grandson lives almost 3 hours away.

Because you are salty about your upbringing and maybe salty about the lack of babysitting? IDK. Just all of you saying \"already raised my children\" all together was enough to make your point that she's not the babysitting kind of grandma. Everything after that was just mean.\n\nIf you want to have a serious discussion with her about how you were raised, then pick your time and place, have your points planned out, don't blindside her about it, and KNOW beforehand what you want to accomplish from the discussion. That's a productive way to handle the trauma you're feeling the effects of right now. \n\nSnarky, mean comments said in the moment are assholery. Even though it's an understandable impulse, lashing out (even in a smart-assed/sarcastic way) is an AH move. It's an immature way to handle those very big feelings. That's my opinion. It might feel satisfying in the moment, but it's still not a great way to handle old grievances.\n\nI'd apologize for saying something in an off-handed way that hurt her feelings. I'm not saying it wasn't true, but how she raised you and your siblings is a different discussion. If that's what you want to address, then you went about it in an unproductive way.\n\nEither forgive her or don't. Talk it out or let it go - that's the grown up way to handle it.

I'm not sure OP is as \"over\" the not-babysitting business as claimed.  \n\nAgain, it's true indictment, but does one have to bring up everything that's true?
