I learned my lesson early on about asking her to babysit. She would either tell me yes and cancel at the last minute or get mad at me for asking. \n\nNow, this by itself wouldn't be a huge deal. However, my mother was the kind of mother who would drop us off at our grandparents all the time. Holidays, we would get dropped off the second day off and picked up 3 days before school started. We spend every weekend with them. Grandma would pick us up from school and make us lunch.  And besides that, every time one of us asked her to babysit, she said, \"I already raised my kids. \". Even if we were just asking her to keep an eye on the kid while we hopped to the store. So it really is the hypocrisy that gets me, not her not babysitting. I couldn't care less about that. \n\nSo my sister had her first kid about  4 months ago. We had a family dinner on Friday where everyone got to meet the baby. \n\nSo we were all mingling, and my sister asked mom at one point if she could watch the baby on Friday for one hour so she could pick up her MIL from the airport. My mom started to say her usual sentence, and my brothers and I jumped in and finished the sentence for her and laughed. My brother then offered to watch baby. We thought it was over, but mom was offended and went on a long rant about disrespect.  My sister was confused and said, \" I just thought you might want to bond with your granddaughter,\" to which I said, \"She didn't even raise us. What makes you think she would want to spend time with our kids?\". I admit I was mad. Because she was acting like she was that martyr who never had time  for herself. When she literally never had us and when she did, my older brother and I took care of everything in the house. Including childcare and house stuff.\n\nObviously, my mother got furious, saying that I was ungrateful. My older brother intervened \nAnd said that we weren't ungrateful , but we couldn't ignore the matter of fact.\n\n\nThe fight escalated, and my mother stormed off. \nMy father called us and told us it was entitled to shame mom for not babysitting. \nAre we the assholes?", "created_utc": 1684085418, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hi46p/aita_for_shaming_my_mother_about_not_taking_care/", "score": 267, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's a basic thing. You're not asking her to take weekends, school breaks etc, you've asked for basic help that any normal parent would be willing to provide. \n\nI see other people's point by saying she's not *required* to babysit her grandkids, but if she was a decent person she would. Probably an unpopular opinion but that's how I see it. \n\nWe want to go on about how \"it takes a village\" etc but as soon as grandma doesn't want to babysit, \"it's not her job!\". \n\nPlus the shaming doesn't even seem to be about her not watching the grandkids, it was based off her not watching *her own* kids which is valid.", "Honestly? NTA. I am sorry for your kids and your nieces/nephews who will not get to experience a great and bonding relationship with at least one of their grandparents since your mother is too selfish to decide those relationships are important to her. Maybe she doesn\u2019t like kids (I\u2019d say definitely, but it\u2019s still an assumption) and would rather wait for them to reach adulthood before she considers them worth her time, but that\u2019s not really how life and family works. You can\u2019t just pretend they don\u2019t matter until you decide they do matter. It sounds like you and your siblings all got it figured out and she deserved to be called out imo. Maybe it could have been said after she left the room or the gathering to spare her feelings, but I can\u2019t say I wouldn\u2019t have done the same thing in your shoes lmao so I can\u2019t really judge you for not holding your tongue.", "NTA i am 47f and my grandson lives almost 3 hours away. He was just born and I wish I could see him every weekend! Seriously, my son and DIL would have to tell me to go away if they lived closer. I would babysit whenever they wanted me to. I spent the weekend with them and I got up early and did the morning feedings so they could sleep in. I could not be like your mom. She is the one missing out because grandchildren are the ones we have fun with and spoil. She is lucky she is near hers!! She is missing out for sure!", "I don't know what others will say, but my judgement is NTA. \n\n\nWhat she did to you was called parentification. Adults are not supposed to make their older children take care of the younger ones. You were right. \n\n\nAnd if the words spoken were as you described, you could have been much harsher. Your sister apparently didn't notice how mom reacted to babysitting asks when it wasn't her kids.", "NTA. Your Mum disrespected you by palming you off on your grandparents your whole lives.

Your mom is doing stuff on purpose and if she doesn\u2019t want to watch the kid, just say it instead of making excuses every single time. I would definitely feel in the way if my mom can\u2019t even watch the kid for 1 hour out the year just so I can pick someone up at airport.

Your mom for past nonsense.  And you and your brother for being jerks for no reason.  Regardless of how much your grandparent watched you, neither one of you is entitled to have your mom watch your kids.  The kids are your responsibility.
