I learned my lesson early on about asking her to babysit. She would either tell me yes and cancel at the last minute or get mad at me for asking. \n\nNow, this by itself wouldn't be a huge deal. However, my mother was the kind of mother who would drop us off at our grandparents all the time. Holidays, we would get dropped off the second day off and picked up 3 days before school started. We spend every weekend with them. Grandma would pick us up from school and make us lunch.  And besides that, every time one of us asked her to babysit, she said, \"I already raised my kids. \". Even if we were just asking her to keep an eye on the kid while we hopped to the store. So it really is the hypocrisy that gets me, not her not babysitting. I couldn't care less about that. \n\nSo my sister had her first kid about  4 months ago. We had a family dinner on Friday where everyone got to meet the baby. \n\nSo we were all mingling, and my sister asked mom at one point if she could watch the baby on Friday for one hour so she could pick up her MIL from the airport. My mom started to say her usual sentence, and my brothers and I jumped in and finished the sentence for her and laughed. My brother then offered to watch baby. We thought it was over, but mom was offended and went on a long rant about disrespect.  My sister was confused and said, \" I just thought you might want to bond with your granddaughter,\" to which I said, \"She didn't even raise us. What makes you think she would want to spend time with our kids?\". I admit I was mad. Because she was acting like she was that martyr who never had time  for herself. When she literally never had us and when she did, my older brother and I took care of everything in the house. Including childcare and house stuff.\n\nObviously, my mother got furious, saying that I was ungrateful. My older brother intervened \nAnd said that we weren't ungrateful , but we couldn't ignore the matter of fact.\n\n\nThe fight escalated, and my mother stormed off. \nMy father called us and told us it was entitled to shame mom for not babysitting. \nAre we the assholes?", "created_utc": 1684085418, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hi46p/aita_for_shaming_my_mother_about_not_taking_care/", "score": 3931, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA.

You can\u2019t just pretend they don\u2019t matter until you decide they do matter. It sounds like you and your siblings all got it figured out and she deserved to be called out imo. Maybe it could have been said after she left the room or the gathering to spare her feelings, but I can\u2019t say I wouldn\u2019t have done the same thing in your shoes lmao so I can\u2019t really judge you for not holding your tongue.", "NTA i am 47f and my grandson lives almost 3 hours away.

She would take me to the cemetery where her family was buried and we would sit and talk for hours about her memories of her parents and siblings. My Zedo taught me how to write, read, do math, how to ride a bike, and garden. He stood out in the snow with my cousins and I waiting for the school bus. They did everything for us. But that was both my mom and dad\u2019s choice to have I that way. I can\u2019t even talk about my grandparents without crying and I\u2019m 40. They\u2019ve been gone since 2004/2005.\n\nYou had every right to say what you did. She barely raised you. And it\u2019s sad she doesn\u2019t want the opportunity to bond with her grandchildren. I would feel angry too.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nYour mum can't expect you to appreciate her for things she never does, and for love she never gave. The truth hurts sometimes, but that's not on you.\n\nYour dad sounds like my dad - always enabling the entitled spouse because it's the path of least resistance. Tell him it doesn't end well. My dad is old & sad & stuck with my impatient mum who is only making his dementia symptoms worse by constantly berating him.", "NTA\n\nEither your father is missing the forest for the trees on that argument or he wasn't present and doesn't grasp that the issue is your mother was not an active mother and thus cannot claim to have been one as her reason to not want to babysit. Just say no, but don't play act like you did some duty for your kids and then absolve yourself.", "I honestly think this is a generational thing. I spent soooooooo much time with grandparents. My parents, however, make me feel guilty for asking to babysit. They can almost never do it. My dad acts like he doesn\u2019t know what to do with the kids and I tell him to have them do chores, put out a board game, etc. I was always bored at my grandparents\u2019 house for a whole weekend and they act like they can\u2019t comprehend having kids over for half a day because they\u2019ll have to feed them or entertain them or something. It\u2019s so weird and I\u2019ve heard this from others as well. Boomers are called the \u201cme generation\u201d\u2026No offense boomers, I didn\u2019t make it up.", "I see this a lot with the Boomer generation, and I don't mean that derogatory. But the \"I did my time\" mentality when it comes to children. A lot of churches are having trouble finding daycare volunteers because people my mom and MIL's age won't volunteer, but when they were my age they were putting their kids in the daycare that they're parents' generation volunteered to staff.", "The issue isn't the fact that she's not a hands on grandmother, the argument happened because she tried to make it seem as though she was a hands on mom that watched her kids almost 24/7 instead of supposedly making the older ones watch the rest and sending them off to her parents place when she didn't want to care for them. \n\nThe only reason why the grandmother got mad at the comments was because she knew she was lying to herself naturally, a parent doesn't want to be told off by their children about how bad of a parent they were or just calling them out in their hypocrisy. \n\nShe doesn't have to watch her grandchildren if she doesn't want to Op and their siblings are aware and fine with that. \n\nConsidering she pushed her children on to her parents whether they were ok with it or not is odd when she doesn't want to spend time with her own grandchildren. The passive aggressive comment was well deserved imo.", "Who was talking about shopping?", "Because she has immigrated for a few years. We would tell her but obs the whole picture didn't seep trough.", "And THAT is why you're NTA.  Sometimes, the truth stings.", "It\u2019s definitely understandable to be upset at her getting defensive about not being there for you and your siblings when you were children, but I\u2019m curious why dad never gets asked to babysit either. Why wasnt he there more for you guys as children?\n\nEDIT: After reading some of your comments, it seems your dad was also neglectful. Im sorry you and your siblings had to deal with that! Often times, immature parents deeply struggle with accountability and admitting to their mistakes. I wish I could say therapy or an intervention with her could help her understand, but honestly you and your siblings might be better trying to heal yourselves from trauma your parents caused. \n\nAlso, NTA!", "Huh, okay get it, still NTA, if your mother didn't want to be marked as a villain she shouldn't have act like one for years.", ">With a mom who sounds like she wasn't really into momming.\n\nAnd a dad who sounds like he wasn't really into dadding. He should also have been involved in the care of his children in the evenings, on weekends, and over school breaks.", "I was born because my mom wanted a cute little doll. She decided at 6 months that I wasn\u2019t what she wanted, so she thought she\u2019d try again. Didn\u2019t work that time either, but decided to go for a third so they could get a boy. She had a fourth and \u201cfinally had a kid she enjoyed.\u201d (Direct quote). Mostly because I was old enough to do all the hard work. My sister and I were like the OP and handed off to Grandma as much as possible. My brother was farmed off to my aunt, and I was old enough to raise my youngest brother and hand her back a potty trained kid with manners when I went to college and he was ready to start kindergarten. \n\nIt was a running joke in my extended family that my parents always had to have one child with them at all times or they wouldn\u2019t show up to family functions.", "Thankyou. I appreciate this very much. \nReading comments from others who've dealt with/dealing with similar issues helps me know I'm not the problem, helps the healing a bit", "But if grandma watches the kids at their own house", "Don't be so sure of that.  My mother used to run away from home for the day every day.  She would leave cooking instructions so that his dinner was ready -- he worked his own business and then he worked night shift in a factory and dinner had to be on the table at 2 pm every day.  I babysat for 5 siblings every day in the summer from the time I was 11 and I cooked dinner for my dad, with help from one sister from the time I was 12.  Mom would come in the door 10 minutes before dad was due home, and he had no idea.  Although it's hard to hide dumping your kids off for 3 days.", "YTA. Big time. You are not entitled to her babysitting. Just tell her you hate her and get it over with. Poor you. You were so mistreated.", "YTA- Clearly your mother hated every second of being a mother and doesn't want any more kid time. She'll have been made to feel bad for that every day of her life. I note you neither asked nor shamed your father, how come he gets a pass?", "You didn't shame your mother for not babysitting, you shamed her for not being a mother. You're fully entitled to your opinion on that.\n\nNTA at all.", "NTA\n\nThis sounds similar to my experience as well.\n\nI am sorry about you and your siblings situation", "NTA! My mother is the same! Worse is she expects a constant stream of photos to show off to her friends.", "NTA. She knows darn well what she is doing, she just can\u2019t admit she didn\u2019t love a lot of stuff that comes with mothering or being a grandma.", "NTA. It\u2019s not about the babysitting, it\u2019s about her pretending to be something/someone she isn\u2019t.", "NTA! It\u2019s sounds like it was about time to call mom out on her crap!", "Not the asshole\n\nMy mom is fortunately very involved with my sister's kid but every time she dared to bitch that it was so much work when she helped her I said \"Well you owe her after her she was stuck with your child (me) for over a decade\". She can admit she DOES owe her at least :)", "OMG do we share the same mom?! I just made a somewhat similar post on here about my mom giving the same lines \ud83e\udd23 she constantly hired a revolving door of various babysitters but when we need help babysitting she says \u201cI\u2019m too old for that. My time raising kids are over.\u201d\n\nNTA. But seeing how we share a similar mother, I know it still hurts a little. It\u2019s good to call her out on it to show you guys see who she is by character traits and patterns not by genetic title. Many can birth kids but not everyone can be a mom or a grandma.", "your mom knows who she actually is, she should accept it rather than fight it.\n\nNTA, truth hurts", "Lmao \ud83e\udd23 NTA", "NTA And it sounds like your father was around even less than your mom.", "NTA. Thank you for this. People continue this narrative  because they never get called out for it. \n\nMy niece has three kids with three different guys.\n\nDoesn\u2019t legally have them because she abused one of them. \n\nDoes that stop her from posting pics on Facebook talking about how hard being a mother is?\n\nAnd then my mom gets mad at me when I didn\u2019t want to be around her. \n\nStart calling people out for their bad behavior!", "NTA. Sorry you had to go through your childhood like that.", "I think you should manage your expectations. If she pawned you guys off whenever she could, what makes you think she wants to take care of your kids?   I\u2019m sure she loves them and all that, but she has repeatedly told you she does not want to babysit. What part of that don\u2019t you understand?  Yes it is sad that she doesn\u2019t dote on them like a cookie baking sleepover grandma. But that\u2019s who she is and she hasn\u2019t lied. YTA.", "you told her the truths. and the truths is your parents suck a parenting. you had to raise yourself/ your grandparents hat to raise you. your moms the AH and your dad is wonderfully enabling her. NTA", "NTA\n\nYour mum sucks.", "Lol, NTA. She\u2019s just pissy about being rightfully called out about being a shit mother.\n\nIf she didn\u2019t want to raise kids she could have, I dunno, not had kids? It\u2019s not fair that you all suffered because of her selfishness.", "Maybe her parents asked and wanted the kids though", "Ever consider how many people are pressured by society to have kids and regret it bitterly?", "Women can also be misogynist", "my dad is like you - his dad sucked, the only good thing he ever did for their family was divorce my grandma and move out. he told me a big part of his parenting philosophy was to be the opposite of him. i grew up in a really happy home and i feel so lucky that he\u2019s my dad. i bet your kids feel the same way about you.", "NTA. Surprised you're even wondering.", "NTA. \n\nIf it weren't true, she wouldn't have gotten so mad. People get so pissed when the truth is called out.", "YTA. If you want your kids to get to know their grandparents, then spend time with them, while you are doing the heavy lifting. Don't expect them to babysit.\n\nI feel like she never wanted kids, but is from a generation that was expected to have kids. Also, why is your dad not a part of this equation? Can't he babysit?", "NTA, your mom just experienced the consequences of following advice from this very sub \ud83d\ude02 She doesn't have to care about anyone else or give her time to her family, but she doesn't get to be high-and-mighty when people acknowledge that.", "NTA", "NTA   The truth is the truth.", "NTA and you weren\u2019t shaming her for not babysitting, you were shaming her for claiming to have done all the work when in reality she had fobbed it off onto others.", "NTA. Mom and dad are. \u201cI\u2019ve already raised my kids.\u201d No ma\u2019am. The grandparents raised the kids. If she wants to get angry, she should be angry at herself. The fact that y\u2019all could finish her sentence is sad really. Sometimes the truth hurts. She was offended because she is narcissistic and in her world everything is about her so she is the victim in this. If you want respect, you have to earn it. And she hasn\u2019t. \n\nYou might have been mad but you didn\u2019t say anything that wasn\u2019t true. She may have given birth to y\u2019all, but she has never acted in the true role of a mother. She left that responsibility to her parents who truly already raised their kids. And when y\u2019all were at home, your older brother and you took on the role for the younger siblings and taking care of the house. \n\nYour brother was correct when saying that it wasn\u2019t about being ungrateful but instead not ignoring the facts. Two very separate things. Also, your fathers response was an AH move. The only person acting entitled is your mom. You weren\u2019t \u201cshaming her.\u201d You were simply stating the truth. Sometimes the truth hurts. If your mom wants to be angry and outraged, she should look no further than herself for all the missed opportunities she has had. You were correct in calling out the hypocrisy because one - she didn\u2019t raise you. Your grandparents did; and two- grandparents do typically babysit. Watching the child for an hour and bonding with them is no where near raising them. \n\nIf it was me, I would tell mom and dad to take a hike.", "INFO. Why aren't you blaming your dad for this but only your mom? Why does your dad get off Scott free when it comes to both child rearing duties when you were a kid and babysitting now? Why is only your mom the target? \n\n\nThe misogyny vibe and \"women are natural caregivers and men shouldn't ever be saddled with anything child related\" are strong here. I'm guessing you're a staunch conservative and hand your kids off to your wife too.", "She parentified the eldest of the 4 siblings and actively didn't want them around in her spare time. There's no way this is about \"roles\" at all.", "INFO: was she a stay at home mother or did she work. I spent a lot of holidays with Grandparents because both my parents had jobs.\n\nAlso NTA in this instance.", "Same here. Saw lot of boomers who literally used their parents as childcare but refuses to do the same. Tbh, I don't judge them but I also feel this enables our gen to be \"me\" as well and not coddling them in the \"mother of the year\" narrative. They simply are not!", "Except all of this does involve him. Why is he so completely except from everything?  Why only blame your mom for dumping you when you have two parents?", "So that's fine because he's a man. Got it.", "I\u2019m sorry OP! NTA! I can\u2019t stand parents who act like they did it on their own with zero help when it\u2019s not true.

They never want to spend time with their grandchildren, but I'd never leave my daughter with them either.\n\nBreaking the cycle is hard - well done.", "Okay. So he also get to be exempt for any kind of responsibility in raising OP and his siblings? Nah, OP is a massive hypocrite when it comes to gender and kids.", "If OP wants to focus on the trauma of only their mother and doesn't want to open up about their father, that is their prerogative. It doesn't change how the mother treated those children.\n\nWe don't need to know the entire family history, or about what their father did to know what the mother did was wrong.\n\nOP has only shared part of their story in the hopes of understanding it better, that's all we need to know.", "None of them good reasons,"]}
