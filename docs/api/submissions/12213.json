The homeless shelters kick out whoever's staying with them in the early morning and won't let them back in until it's nighttime again, so many homeless people hang out in our library during the day.  One homeless man approached me soon after I arrived for my shift and asked me for $0.50.  I got my wallet out and was about to give him the $0.50, but then he upped his request to $2.00.\n\nI did have (and could reasonably give away) $2.00, but I absolutely despise when beggars use the [foot in the door technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-in-the-door_technique) on me; the fact they feel so entitled to anyone else's money that they try to act clever and think I won't realize what they're doing pisses me off.  So I closed my wallet and told him never mind, that he wasn't getting anything from me.  He continued to plead for money despite me telling him no multiple times, and eventually I got angry and yelled at him to \"Get out!\"  (I mostly just wanted him to stop harassing me and get out of my face/department, not the building as a whole, but \"Get out!\" was all I could think to say at the time.)  This attracted one of our security guards, who told him to leave the building.\n\nThe man walked out, and as I was explaining to the guard what happened, he walked back in to ask me (seemingly genuinely) why I became so angry at him.  Both the guard and I told him to just leave, without answering his question, and he left for good.  After a little while of reflecting on the situation, I'm thinking that maybe I did actually overreact, particularly because it was over an inconsequential amount of money.  He also can't come back in the building for the rest of the day, so he might be stuck out in the cold and snow until the shelters let him back in tonight (this event happened around 8:20 AM).

Or to that particular homeless man?\n\nI'm not going to judge you without the answer to this question, not as some sort of \"Is this you?/gotcha\" moment, but because I don't know that man.\n\nThe foot in the door thing is annoying, but it happens when people who happen to be homeless are asking for money for a reason. Because they might ask 20 people for 50 cents before one person says yes. But a sandwich costs $2. So they have to get 4 yeses. That's 80 people to ask. They need a warm place to exist in the meantime, so in the mornings, the library is one of few places they can *be*. You know as well as I do that at 8ish in the morning, *most* people at the library are homeless. 80 people makes it noon before they can afford breakfast, doesn't it? And that's *if* they could ask every person. But they can't because they get tossed out on the street if they do. So... dinner time, then. And they can eat 1 sandwich today, and do it all again tomorrow. Or they could ask the person who has already opened a wallet, and *hopefully*, seen them as a person... to give a little bit more.\n\n... If I knew for sure that this person who is homeless was *that* kind of person, then I wouldn't think he's an AH.\n\nOfc, there's another type of \"homeless\" person who often isn't even homeless, and who scams and cons everyone out of money using every trick in the book, so that they can buy booze or drugs or gamble or pay their bills cause they live near an area where people give generously and frequently... and if this individual is *that* type of homeless person, then yep, they are an AH.\n\nSo... I wouldn't know whether to go with n t a or n a h, if I thought you *weren't* an AH ... and I wouldn't know whether to go with y t a or e s h if I thought you *were* an AH... \n\nAnd only you have any perspective on what type of person this man was.\n\nAnd as far as whether or not you are the AH? It depends on your motivations. You said you could reasonably give the $2.\n\nIf the man had approached you and said \"can you spare $2?\" would you have opened your wallet?\n\nIf not, then your choice had nothing to do with the \"foot in the door technique\" and you're being dishonest with yourself.\n\nIf so, then... were you attempting to deliberately punish this man because you assumed he was doing something *inherently wrong and/or harmful*? Or because you thought he was being irritating?\n\nWere you doing what you thought was right? Or taking out your frustration with the world on him?\n\nI looked at your profile to gain some insight, and your other comments left me still unsure.\n\nI'd love to hear the answers to any/all of these questions, and even discuss them/give a judgement based on your answer. But I also recognize that it's probably unnecessary. Either you won't bother to answer them even to yourself (in which case you are probably an AH) or you will. \n\nIf you do answer them to yourself, either you'll decide you were being an AH or you'll decide you weren't... and my opinion likely won't change that either way.\n\nSo I guess \"info\" is the best I can do here. Again, though, I'm open to changing it either way!", "YTA. Sure the foot in the door technique is a bit slimy but you let a man asking you for an extra $1.50 ruin your whole day and make you lose your cool and embarrass yourself.

You can either be part of a system that helps people or part of a system that dehumanizes them. It's your choice. But since you've chosen a library job, you're going to have to make choices like that every single day.  You can either choose to kick people out when they ask you for money too many times, or maybe you could use your energy for good (i.e. coordinate with a local charitable group for them to drop off hygiene kits for you to stash at the desk, and if someone panhandles you, you can give them a hygeine kit instead).", "YTA, mad at a homeless person for trying to beg for cash to survive?

No panhandling on library property. And they mean it. (And it applies to everyone. So even if you\u2019re not homeless, if you find yourself short on change for a vending machine, tough luck.) No causing a disturbance or harassing others. (Again, this applies to all and can protect the homeless population from being harassed.)

Most of them seem perfectly content with being homeless and don't want actual help \n\nSo... I'm retired now (disabled) but I used to work as teacher. Did pharmacy work while I was in school. Now I'm a SAHM, and volunteer at the library.\n\nBut... once upon a time, I was also homeless. It wasn't as bad then as it is now. Without the pandemic precautions in shelters now there was more space. Meal sites could accommodate more people. \n\nIt's... a LOT harder now. But even back then... You cannot get a job if you don't have an address. You cannot get a job if you can't shower. You cannot get a job if you're spending your entire day trying to ... get through the day.\n\nI was lucky. Because I am a woman, I had a place in a shelter. Me and another lady had to share a room. We'd get up at 5am because we had to be out by 7am and there was always a line for the showers.\n\nWe would leave and walk the 3 miles to the nearest meal site (a church that served breakfast at 9:30am). Her husband would meet us there. They'd lost their home when a neighbor ended up setting his own house on fire and it spread to theirs. We'd wait in line for forever then get inside at 9:30. We were put at a table then had to wait until the pastor had led a prayer and told us all how if we prayed enough we'd be okay, and how the hunger in our bellies would go away if we fed our souls... or whatever the sermon was that day... and around 10 am we'd get in line. If we were lucky, front of the line... if you were in the back of the line you were eating lunch, not breakfast.\n\nThen we had a choice to make. My friend and I had already showered because, yknow, shelter. But her husband hadn't. There was a place where people could sit and (if a machine was free) wash clothes, or warm up, or shower. But it was about a 2 hour walk from the meal site. He could go there and get cleaned up so someone might hire him.  We could go job hunting without him.\n\nOr we could try to make it to the site where they serve dinner, a little farther out than the shower site. It was noonish, though, so with a 2.5 hour walk, we'd still have about 2.5 hours to kill before dinner. So job hunt? Cool. Except they didn't have the meal sites and shower sites in commercial districts, so we'd have to walk wayyy out of the way to get near any businesses... or even to go downtown to the welfare office to use the computer lab. If we didn't time it perfectly, and we chose to job hunt, we wouldn't eat again until the next day. Which was fine on days when they had like... pastries and things we could sneak out with us for later... because you had to sneak it out. They'd rather you throw the food on your tray away than allow you to take it out of the building.\n\nOther days we had to forgo the job hunt so we wouldn't end up malnourished.\n\nAfter dinner... usually around 6:30.. we'd head back toward the shelter. Sometimes one of us had scrounged up a couple bucks for something to drink. \n\nI would buy a bottle of water at the gas station near the shelter for $1.67. Me and my friend would split it... I don't drink cause it messes up my stomach, and she couldn't because she was pregnant, but the guys? About 4 of them would pool their money to buy a cheap 6 pack of beer for $1.89. Because then they *all* had something to drink. It was cheaper than water. And then we had to go in, because check-in at the shelter was at 8:30, and if you were a minute late, you lost your spot.\n\nWith less than 2 hours per day to look for work, while starving and exhausted from walking 7+ hours per day... without appropriate interview attire, or an address to put on applications... how long would it take you to find a job?\n\nTook me 2 years. Because I was lucky.\n\nYou're right... *some* people who are homeless are lying. Or they are shitty people. Or they are lazy. \n\nMost aren't.\n\nMost are just people, who've been screwed over through no fault of their own. I'd fled a DV situation. My friends' house had burned down. Another lady at the shelter got evicted because someone new bought the building she lived in. One of the guys was injured in Desert Storm and the VA screwed him over.\n\nEveryone has a story. And every one of those people who are homeless is a *person*. An individual. Not part of some faceless mass of \"homeless people\". \n\nYou don't owe anyone anything. You aren't required to give other people money.  You can't be an AH for refusing to do so.\n\nYou *are* an AH for judging people you don't know, on circumstances outside of their control.\n\nIt sounds like you are biased against a group of people. And when this man asked for more help from someone who was helping him, you assumed he was deceitful rather than grateful. \n\nBut instead of walking away, you yelled and got him thrown out deliberately. Do *you* think that was an AH move?", "YTA for that statement. if you had to sleep on the dangerous streets in extreme temperatures with no way of having a meal and society looking down on you then you would drink alcohol and do drugs too. how do you expect them to get a job when most don\u2019t have   access to clothes, a shower, transportation. be a better person.", "well, you sure showed that geriatric mentally ill guy who lives on the streets who's boss, didn't you", "And I never said that.

The man didn't like the answer so he harassed OP to force an answer change.", "youre missing the point. someone said no, no means no. so you stop after someone says no. NO MEANS NO. just because ive maybe been annyoing in the past doesnt give me the right to bypass someone saying no nor does it justify it. its still wrong. and idk about you but being annyoing is something a child does i tend to stick to myself its not hard to know what is and isnt annoying . so no i usually am not annoying.", "What an ignorant take. Addiction can be a symptom of homelessness.", "It's a library, there's plenty of space that's away from this guy", "i did answer it.", "Your question said \"your workplace\" not \"library\" I answered your question appropriately, referencing my workplace. If I worked in this library I'd just give him the 2 dollars.", "I agree, OP shouldn't be subjected to it. But TA in this specific situation for handling it poorly, and also losing touch with humanity for a second.", "And yet, I expressed you were annoying me but you think you have a right to keep responding. It seems like you're missing the point. Annoying is subjective from person to person, you and OP need to stop pretending like your veiw rules the world. OP came here asking for opinions, I am allowed to give one and it can be different than yours. But I'm not the one repeatedly commenting to someone's who's never initiated anything with them and have made it clear they find annoying. Now I am asking you to leave me alone and not interact with me anymore.", "Those who live or work in cities with high rates of homelessness, experience panhandling every day and it can get aggressive. While most will not say anything or just ask once, there are still those who will be persistent to the point of harassment. There are laws against aggressive panhandling. Though it would be nice if people didn't have to resort to panhandling to subsist. A good safety net is what makes the difference.", "OP didnt \"lose touch with reality\" someone was harassing them after they said no and was pushed to saying get out.... gtfo homeless people arent stupid he knew what he was doing", "no", "Oh so you dont actually agree that no means no when it comes to taking up space or being annoying? Seems like my entire point is proven. You just did what you're saying the other person is wrong for and are refusing to respect me like you think OP should be respected.", "you know you can block me right or not respond......", "I'm aware, you know I don't actually care right, I wanted you to prove my point and you did.", "do you feel better", "YTA\n\nThe consequences to him were much greater. I\u2019d have told security and him your reasoning and clarified you\u2019re fine as long as he stops panhandling in the library. \n\nHe may benefit from your trigger for future. Just ask for \u2018a dollar or whatever you can spare\u2019 instead of switching it up.\n\nI don\u2019t fault you given you reflects on it and it was an honest over reaction in the moment. If you see him again, I\u2019d let him know he\u2019s welcome back and no panhandling inside (maybe include the above tip).", "Soft YTA. It is very common for homeless ppl to use libraries as their stay in place for the day. I think you were well within your right to not give any money to him if you did not want to. He was wrong to harass you but if you had exercised some consideration you could have told him a firm no and warn him that you would have gotten him removed by the securities. Most homeless people back off at this point as they don't want to be in the cold. \n\nHowever, the part which makes you the soft AH is that you changed your mind after he asked for more than 50 cents. It maybe a foot in door technique but he is a beggar for food or something very basic. I think it is an un-compassionate move to retract after having offered the cold and hungry man the 50 cents.", "Is this in Bloomington?", "A homeless man asked my grandson for a cigarette and he pulled out his pack to show he only had two left. He gave Homes the last one. H. Guy then asked if grandson had a dollar. GS patted his pockets, stated he was out for a walk no wallet, no change. Homeless Guy went all thundercloud face and snarls, calling Grandson a fucking asshole.\n\nGrandson grabbed back cigarette and said, \"NOW, I'm a fucking asshole.\"\n\nGrandson asked for my opinion. I told him he's absolutely a fucking asshole...for smoking in the first place. Three people in our family have died in undignified, cruel pain and misery from lung cancer. Genetics, buddy! Genetics.", "ESH.  You should not be giving money to people at your work asking money.  It encourages them to panhandle on the premises.  You also should only keep the money you want to give out in a pocket by itself.  Never let someone see your wallet in a public space.", "NTA you got angry because instead of him trying to do anything productive with himself, like you were at your JOB, he is just asking people for more and more. He can find something to do on the streets. Sorry you were harassed, I have found since living in a big city that the homeless are legit so mean.", "NTA for not giving him money but YTA for your hostility towards \u201cbeggars\u201d he literally didn\u2019t have 50 cents who tf wouldn\u2019t ask for two dollars if they thought they might get it? He\u2019s a human who has to survive. Not some Wall Street scammer. $2 gets you what 1 bag of chips OR a soda??? There\u2019s no rage to be had. Either yes or no it\u2019s that simple. Sad that people like you work in places like libraries which are literally designed for the poor.", "YTA. Especially for the time of year.", "He could have thought about his dignity before harassing someone for money? Like we all have a limit.", "Perfectly put! I was once taking a taxi to catch a flight. I realised that I was a few pounds short of pay in the drop off. No card pay was available. If he had made me go to a cash machine and pay him I would have missed my flight for sure. He was a very modest and low pay driver who gracefully let it go and said \"it's okay, don't worry about it.\" I can never repay him or ever forget the gratitude I felt at that point.   \nHe could have let it go along with being rude or smirking at me - he did not.", "Panhandling the patrons and staff would be a reason.", "Panhandling the patrons and staff would be a reason.", "Yeah okay now you're an asshole.", "Your ignorance and privilege is abhorrent.", "Not all homeless people are addicts.
