{"id": 33734, "submission_id": "18r1jwp", "title": "AITA for holding a grudge against my friend from something she said over the summer?", "selftext": "Over the summer I (22F) went to the beach in my small town with a few friends (all 22F) and one mutual friend. I usually talk alot and I was talking about a guy I was seeing over the summer. I met my friends in high school and we\u2019ve all stayed close throughout the years after. One of my friends got a boyfriend in college and told us they planned on breaking up when they finished. I never really judged her relationship style but I also guessed that they weren\u2019t going to break up because I secretly thought that it was weird to \u2018plan a break up.\u2019 Anyways, we\u2019re talking on the beach about boys and while I\u2019m explaining why I don\u2019t see me and this guy I\u2019m talking to working out long term, my friend with the boyfriend interrupts me and says \u201chave you ever even had a relationship?\u201d And I was taken aback. I\u2019ve had relationships since high school but I didn\u2019t feel like proving my point, just nothing that\u2019s lasted more than a year I guess. I like to consider myself a free spirit my friends just like to hear the drama. Anyways I didn\u2019t know she was CEO of my relationship status and I said \u201cthat was rude\u201d and we quickly changed the subject. But I honestly still think about this because I wish I said something about how her relationship came with an expiration date and she\u2019s overall been really entitled about the whole thing. Now over the holidays I\u2019ve made plans without her I\u2019m not trying to purposely exclude her but I enjoy more time with my single friends. Anyways just wondering if I\u2019m the asshole for kind of giving up on our friendship since we\u2019ve been friends for about 8 years. Thanks!\n\nEdit: I\u2019m just kind of upset about the fact she tried to call me out in a public setting around people who we\u2019re close with, because she has a boyfriend she\u2019s been super judgmental about the guys I talk to. I also have high standards and I won\u2019t settle for any guy that wants to take me out, so it\u2019s annoying feeling belittled like that.
