They did end up divorcing later down the line, and then my dad got lung cancer and moved in with his sister til his death a few years ago.\n\nPoint is, she had her own family and never tried to force a relationship on grown adults. \n\nIt was the same with my dad's mother, she remarried late in life. No one ever insisted we call him Pepere (very French influenced, my great grandparents immigrated), we all called him by his name.\n\nAs for her hysterics over \"never being a mum\" perhaps she should have tried cultivating a friendship instead of a parentship. It's like, you HAVE a mother. You were an adult when he remarried. You don't need a new motherly figure.", "NTA. Anna's tears were just an attempt to manipulate you. Since you were an adult when they got married, Anna needs to understand you most likely won't ever see her as anything more than your dad's wife. If Anna wanted to play mommy, she should have chosen a man with young kids.", "NTA.", "NTA. Youve only known this person for a year (maybe not even that!), thats asking a lot from someone you barely know and who did absolutely nothing on raising you.", "NTA. Starting the night they were married I had to give my step father a hug every night he was home. He had split custody of his kids so he had an apartment to visit them every other week. We barely talk now. I get texts telling me to say happy Father\u2019s Day and I get it, but pushing it never ends well. Kid has to decide, not the adults.", "NTA.  She's not your mum.  And your dad can sulk in the corner as long as he wants to.", "NTA at all. That is just bizarre.", "I'll never forget when I was engaged to my ex. Mom went off on this soliloquoy about things she would answer to and how whatever he wanted to use (including \"hey you\") would be copacetic. I loved her so much for that, and it was hysterically funny as well. \nBeing a step parent isn't all that different from being an in-law. There's no blood there and everyone has to forge their own paths and relationships.\nNTA", "Basic NTA\n\nSo here it kind of depends on your tone. Like the words are fine but you sounded overly harsh about it or mean that could be the problem. That would make you a little A but the step mom should not have put you in that situation. \n\nBut ya adult shouldnt try to force kids / young adults to call them mom or dad when they are step parents. Up to the \"kid\" to decide if they want to.", "NTA. I will say this as much as I have to, my Dad has been remarried for 13 years now. I am 28, I still do not refer to my stepmother as \"Mom\", and she has never asked me to. They gave birth to my half sister whom I love to pieces, and after all this time (met her when I was 13) I consider her to be my 2nd mother (maybe 3rd cuz my auntie has no kids and she's always been there but the point stands.) That relationship took years to solidify and it happened naturally, I couldn't imagine what would've happened had she tried to force it. The fact she can't have kids is very emotionally damaging, but forcing that unto you is just gonna cause more problems.", "NTA.  She is being weird. Not your problem.", "NTA and if your dad truly understands then he wouldn't ask you to call someone else mom just because they're uncomfortable. It's not your job to fill the gap for Anna just because she's married to your dad.", "NTA it\u2019s not keeping peace if it harms you.", "NTA. You were an ADULT when the met.\nAnna needs therapy.", "Your dad is the AH. Just stay away he made his feeling clear.", "I\u2019m all for boundaries. I don\u2019t believe you should call her anything you don\u2019t want to. I will say your post reads like you look at her like she\u2019s mud that got on your shoes.", "NTA. Totally weird to expect a full-grown adult to call you mom. Especially when you already have one.", "Kinda unhinged having the gall to have a tantrum over an adult you met a year ago (when they were 18 at the time) not calling you mom \ud83d\ude2c NTA", "NTA.  What a selfish adult.  What makes a parent is caring about their child and devoting themselves to them.  She can earn being a mom instead of trying to use you for her own satisfaction", "NTA.\n\n\"Because you should feel how I feel because I said so!\"", "Maybe you can call her stepmom\u2026.?", "Not only that, but this an adult person who\u2019s mother is still alive and very much part of her life, so it\u2019s extra weird. NTA", "I wonder if Anna is setting up to be the grandmother from hell. Starting with forcing a mother/daughter relationship with OP.", "It seems pretty obvious that the stepmom wants OP to consider her as mom\u2026", "Totally agree. I lost my mom when I was 24. Though I like my ex mother in law I never called her mom cause it felt strange. Though my current husbands mom I freaking love and happily call her mom. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just that they are totally different people or if it was because I met my ex when my own mom was still alive but either way it is similar and you definitely need to forge relationship however they are comfortable for you.", "Thanks for introducing me to a new word \"slake\", I like it.", "Lol! This is the way", ">In fact I am no longer a child at all.\n\nRight! Telling a 19 yr oof to call you mom/mum is ridiculous!", "Yes it does.  Mum is a name and position.  She can be mum the name but not mum the position.", "The name comes with the position. It is not just given out willy nilly"]}
