Dad meet Anna (46) last year and they got married 6 months ago. I personally had no interest in having a relationship with her and even told her this and she at the time of us meeting accepted that. Anyway it was dad birthday last week and I went over to wish him a happy birthday before heading to school. \n\nDad wasn't up, only Anna was. So I said Anna when dad gets up can you tell him, I'll come over after my classes were over and she said you can call me mum now that me and your dad are married. I was a little taken back, but I said no you will always be Anna and I will never see you as my mum nor call you mum. She started crying and saying she can't have any children and she would like to experience what it's like to have a daughter. I said that's not my problem and I already have a mum and nobody will replace her. She cried some more and since I'm uncomfortable around emotional displays, I just left.\n\nDad said he understands why I said it, but could I please for the sake of keeping the peace call her mum? I refused and now he's not talking to me.

OP if you don\u2019t ever want to call her mum then don\u2019t and that\u2019s fine. Your dad just needs to accept that and so does Anna.", "It's not your responsibility to please Anna. The fact that she married your dad doesn't automatically create a maternL relationship between you two.\n\nIt seems like you treat her with respect, and that should be enough for your father.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nSomething is wrong with this picture.", "NTA\n\nwtf??", "You are not TA. You are blunt and to the point and sometimes snowflakes will get offended over that. Anna (father's wife) was out of line when stating she wants you to call her mum. She has a problem - not you. If she cannot handle not being a mother, then she needs to seek counselling rather than trying to force a relationship on other people, like yourself. Don't be discouraged if people say you are wrong for not indulging her fantasies of playing mum - you are being true to your feelings. Perhaps your dad and his wife can foster or adopt - after counselling of course - to fulfill her needs.", "She is literally not your mother, just your dad's current wife.  Not there for any significant portion of your childhood or any event where you would have needed or wanted your actual mother.\n\nNTA.  she needs to stay in her lane.", "Deserved", "Is there a specific reason why you have no interest in having a relationship with the woman your father loves and who obviously would like to be closer to you?\nShe met your dad last year so she clearly was not the cause of the divorce.\nNot calling her mum is one thing, but being cruel to her seems unnecessary.", "Just be nice to people.  Love others.  No you don\u2019t need to call her mum    But kindness would be a good thing.", "**YTA** \\- Address people by whatever name they prefer.  That has always been correct etiquette.  But just because she wants to be called \"mum\" doesn't mean that she is mum.  No one is asking you to consider her as your mum.", "You\u2019re entitled to feel what you feel, but YTA for how you handled it for sure. You went waaaaay over the top.\n\nA simple \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with that and it\u2019s too soon for us to have that type of relationship at all.\u201d would have been much better.\n\nThey probably would have accepted that with very little issue, and this shows you have a lot of maturing to do.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She should never have asked you to call her mum when you have a mum who is alive and well and in your life but your complete refusal to bother to get to know her in any fashion and how aloof your response was to her emotional distress were pretty harsh. Could have easily told her that you wouldn\u2019t feel right calling her mum because you already have one but that you would love to get to know her and spend time together since she\u2019s so important to your dad. No need to be so dismissive from day one."]}
