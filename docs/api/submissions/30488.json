Anyway it was dad birthday last week and I went over to wish him a happy birthday before heading to school. \n\nDad wasn't up, only Anna was. So I said Anna when dad gets up can you tell him, I'll come over after my classes were over and she said you can call me mum now that me and your dad are married. I was a little taken back, but I said no you will always be Anna and I will never see you as my mum nor call you mum. She started crying and saying she can't have any children and she would like to experience what it's like to have a daughter. I said that's not my problem and I already have a mum and nobody will replace her. She cried some more and since I'm uncomfortable around emotional displays, I just left.\n\nDad said he understands why I said it, but could I please for the sake of keeping the peace call her mum?

You are blunt and to the point and sometimes snowflakes will get offended over that. Anna (father's wife) was out of line when stating she wants you to call her mum. She has a problem - not you. If she cannot handle not being a mother, then she needs to seek counselling rather than trying to force a relationship on other people, like yourself. Don't be discouraged if people say you are wrong for not indulging her fantasies of playing mum - you are being true to your feelings.

She should never have asked you to call her mum when you have a mum who is alive and well and in your life but your complete refusal to bother to get to know her in any fashion and how aloof your response was to her emotional distress were pretty harsh. Could have easily told her that you wouldn\u2019t feel right calling her mum because you already have one but that you would love to get to know her and spend time together since she\u2019s so important to your dad. No need to be so dismissive from day one.", "Nta\u2026 she\u2019s not you mum I could understand her wanting to be called mum if you were little and didn\u2019t have a mum and Anna actually played a part in raising you. You met this woman a year ago when legally (in my country) you are an adult she\u2019s never put a plaster on a scraped knee never mind raised you so she doesn\u2019t get the title mum and your dad is just being a dick not speaking to you coz he wife is throwing a hissy fit", "They could always adopt.", "\"I understand why you didn't do it, but she's really needy, you see? So could you, pretty please, do it? It's probably the reason why she married me, so it would really do me a solid.\"\n\nNTA. Props to his wife for spelling out her neediness like that. It's terribly unhealthy, but sure is amazing to look at.", "NTA..\n\nI really dislike when people pretend to accept a boundary then later feel it's ok to walk all over it. You had explained your feelings to her in the beginning. You are old enough to not need another mom and had explained that to her. It's not your fault that she felt being married to your father would change your feelings on the matter. You are not the ah. But your dad is being foolish thinking he can give you the silent treatment for enforcing a boundary you had set right from the start. If he wants to damage your relationship because of this, then that's on him. You have the right to your feelings and boundaries you set. Don't allow anyone to make you feel guilty for enforcing rules you set. You deserve better from your dad. I'm really sorry you are going through this, but you are NTA \ud83c\udf3b", "If she so desperately needs to be called a mother, she should go adopt a child.", "Sure, I'll also start calling my mom's BF \"Dad\", you know, \"to keep the peace\"", "NTA - for not wanting to call her mom.  Although if you love your dad, I don\u2019t see why you can\u2019t have a relationship with his new wife. You don\u2019t have to see her as your mom to be polite and have a relationship.  Yes she is overstepping by asking you to call her mom.  That needs to be corrected!  But saying you don\u2019t want a relationship with her from the start is incredibly immature.  You want your dad to die alone?  Maybe he shouldn\u2019t accept your SO for no obvious reason.  You will have your own life, is your dad going to stay single for the rest of it to please you?  Grow up.", "nta", "NTA\nThis is a ridiculous ask from  one adult to another. She's overstepping and your father is being an ass. I suppose you could compromise amd start calling your dad by his given name since apparently titles should be taken and given at a whim instead of earned.", "NTA \nThat was a weird thing Anna asked of you, an adult who she was never involved in parenting. But people are weird, asking a weird thing can happen. Anna seems like she\u2019s having a hard time, which is not your responsibility, but still quite sad. Really sorry your dad is acting this way toward you. Hope it resolves with some more talking.", "*<For the sake of peace>*\n\nSuch an entitled, boundary disrespecting, loathsome phrase....\n\nNTA", ">I'm uncomfortable around emotional displays, I just left\n\nAsshole dogwhistle. Really, if first thing when someone show some emotions for you is to run, then really you are asshole. \n\nBut other than that - NTA. It would be different if you were 10 years younger and she did job of your mother. But you were nearly adult when you first met her. Her feelings are valid, but how she tried to use them - not so much. If she want a kid that much she could put adoption as an option for her and your father.", "It all come down to what is more distressful. Call a person mum a couple of times per year and have dad have some happy days or die on your hill to keep that particular sound out of your throat.\nIt is easy for you. You fo not have to live with her but are not willing to compromise fir those 2 times per year you see them. But your integrity is saved. NTA of course. I hope you will be so uncompromising also for requests from less important people.", "NTA if she wants children she can go for adoption. and not a 19year old adult who has a mom", "NTA\n\nAnna needs to get over herself.\n\nShe is not your mum and she is never going to be.", "Nta the audacity of some people is astounding", "Nta he needs to handle his wife.", "NTA", "NTA. You have drawn your line and now it's up to your dad's wife to either accept it or see your nonexistent relationship disappear further from view.\n\nIt confuses the ever-loving hell out of me when people don't realise that if they just acted like a normal, friendly person they'd form a much better relationship with their spouse's children than if they try to force a parental bond.", "NTA", "NTA- Step-mom and Dad are the ATA as a mom and a Step-mom I never understood why Step-parents would insist that their Step-kids call them Mom/Dad.  Good for you that you are not giving in to fulfilling her delusion of being a \"Mom\" to a daughter.  I hope you have a great relationship with your Mom and she understands why you feel this way.", "NTA she is unstable thinking she can force a relationship to that degree. I only have one mom and would never call a partner\u2019s mom with that title. Your dad is weird too. He is willing to cut you out off his life to please his wife. Such weird hill to die on.", "NTA\n\nIn fact, I think it was wrong of her to offer in the first place, you're an adult, your mom is well and you've only known this woman for less than a year, god knows how many times you've met her, and suddenly she wants to be your mom? I understand step parents offering to take such a role in children's life, it's a beautiful gesture and if the kid is willing it will make for an amazing opportunity, especially when the bio parent isn't available for what ever reason, but you're no kid and she's a stranger that married your dad.", "NTA\n\nHe married someone with emotional problems. It's not your job to piece her fragile ego together.", "NTA", "What planet is Anna from that she thinks starting a relationship with your dad when you're almost an adult would in any way translate into you having motherly feelings towards her? Madness.   \nAnd as for your dad, the one who needs to keep the peace is the one who first broke it- Anna. And she can keep that peace by accepting reality and never overstepping your boundaries again.  \nNTA", "NTA for not calling her mum.\n\nMaybe TA for being so rude to the SO of your dad (who he met 2 years after the divorce so there really shouldn't be that much animosity there) and making things so difficult.  \nReally depends on how she is treating you/what else happened but given that she wants you to call her mum, it does not seem like she hates you/was disgusting to you.", "NTA no lol she never mothered you. She entered your life when you were what 17/18 - and a adult. There was no parenting and you have a mother. She's your dads wife and that's it. She wants a kid she can get a surrogate, she can adopt, she can foster.", "\"I am not your wife's surrogate child. In fact I am no longer a child at all. It is not my job to slake whatever unmet emotional needs she may have. It's weird and gross that you both expect that. Perhaps you should consider getting her a puppy.\"", "OP is 19!!\n\nIDK, something about asking an adult child to magically consder you a parental figure after marriage is not only delusional, it veers into creepy.\n\n\"we signed a legal paper after knowing each other for 2-3 years, call me MOMMY\" cue tears. YIKES", "It's even more weird because they're 19yr and not a child. \n\nIt's like asking your 45yr adul child to call some random stranger mom/dad because your 70yr parent decided to get married again. \n\nYou don't know them or have any connections with them. It's just creepy.", "I seriously don't understand why people are so judgy about Opie saying no and giving her boundaries. Like COME ON, HER MOTHER IS ALIVE FOR GOODNESS SAKES!!!!!\n\nShe is Dad's wife not her mother, PERIOD!!!\n\nShe loves Opie's dad, fine, he is an adult and whatever but in no certainty is she obligated to cater to her feelings just for peace's sake.\n\nNTA", "Hahahahaha.....oh wait, YOUR SERIOUS?!\n\nOh please.

That's what I prefer.", "Your just delulu", "Cordial you mean. \n\nIs your form of kindness giving in to her delusions and hurting her own mother, wow that is so not kind", "What compromise? Calling her mom isn't a compromise it's just giving in to what she wants", "I seriously don't understand why people are so judgy about Opie saying no and giving her boundaries.

No problemo.", "Its all about setting expectations, if you call her mom now, she's gonna ask for a glass of milk.  She will start to expect all the mom stuff and the Dad will plead for it and when it doesn't happen? She will still be devastated. It's called \"nipping it in the bud\"", "Sure. Set the expectation. Burn everything NOW becouse no need to wait the escalation later. OP is 19, clearly live somewhere else, go to school, not clear who pays for it and her living. Dad ask: help me live peacefully, call her mum a couple of times when you come.\nAnswer: fu.\nFeedback: thank you for considering my request, fruit of growing distess in a relationship I have to live continuously, not worth of your very occasional distress. You know what, fu too.\n\nHere OP, dad, stepmom show who they are to each other. Result is increasing stiffness in the relationship that will have consequences. So as long as the consequences, which are still very uncertain (but I suppose we all can grossly estimate how things can escalate), are known and a risk assessment of costs and benefits for every subject can be estimated, every subject in the group will deal with them to set proper expectations.\nI just immagine that as long as stepmother is sweet dad will stick to her since he lives with her. Stick to her also mean that possibly OP stiffness will be retaliated somehow, from cold shoulder to cut money (I do not know if OP is jndependent). Anyway it will be eventually painful. So choose your pain carefully. And maybe keep the door open, there is always time to go nuclear later."]}
