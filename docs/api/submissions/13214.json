About three minutes in I feel my suit getting baggier, and I I even notice a piece is falling off. I was disappointed that they were a cheap pair but I kept going. Once we hit rapids it got real though. I felt a sudden rush of cold water and I notice my trunks have been torn clear off by the water. I stood up covering myself with just the last piece. Everyone else, about 15 of her friends and family, started to laugh. I was absolutely horrified, one of my biggest fears is being naked in public, and now I was completely nude with no way to get back. \n\nI can\u2019t tell you how trapped and humiliated I felt. I had to spend the rest of the day with the water up to my shoulders, feeling awkward and embarrassed the whole time. Whenever we were in shallow water I was forced to stand up and walk exposed in front of them. They weren\u2019t prudish either, her friends and parents made jokes and comments on my body as we went. Her young cousins made sure to comment on the shape and size of my junk when I couldn\u2019t cover myself also. \n\nWhen we got back to the beach I had to run covering myself back to my towel. My day was completely ruined. I felt humiliated and angry. When we got back to our room, I was back into clothes trying to forget the day when my girlfriend comes in giggling to herself. She asked me if I liked the new swim trunks, and when I asked what she meant she told me she had ordered a prank dissolving pair in lounge and replaced my other one with it. I was absolutely livid.
