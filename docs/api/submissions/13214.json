She had been planning this trip for a long time and was looking forward to it, especially since I\u2019d get to know them all. \n\nOn the third day we planned to go river floating. When we got there I was looking through my bag before I went to change and couldn\u2019t find my trunks. I instead found a new navy blue pair. When I told her this she replied with \u201coh yeah, that\u2019s the extra one I packed in case you lost yours.\u201d I thought this was thoughtful, I changed into them and we all headed down towards the river. \n\nWe all got into our tubes and started floating off. About three minutes in I feel my suit getting baggier, and I I even notice a piece is falling off. I was disappointed that they were a cheap pair but I kept going. Once we hit rapids it got real though. I felt a sudden rush of cold water and I notice my trunks have been torn clear off by the water. I stood up covering myself with just the last piece. Everyone else, about 15 of her friends and family, started to laugh. I was absolutely horrified, one of my biggest fears is being naked in public, and now I was completely nude with no way to get back. \n\nI can\u2019t tell you how trapped and humiliated I felt. I had to spend the rest of the day with the water up to my shoulders, feeling awkward and embarrassed the whole time. Whenever we were in shallow water I was forced to stand up and walk exposed in front of them. They weren\u2019t prudish either, her friends and parents made jokes and comments on my body as we went. Her young cousins made sure to comment on the shape and size of my junk when I couldn\u2019t cover myself also. \n\nWhen we got back to the beach I had to run covering myself back to my towel. My day was completely ruined. I felt humiliated and angry. When we got back to our room, I was back into clothes trying to forget the day when my girlfriend comes in giggling to herself. She asked me if I liked the new swim trunks, and when I asked what she meant she told me she had ordered a prank dissolving pair in lounge and replaced my other one with it. I was absolutely livid. She had purposefully exposed and violated me because she thought it\u2019d be a good laugh. She even made sure not to pack another pair or a towel. I started yelling and she told me to calm down, saying that it was only a joke.\n\nI left that night, and I didn\u2019t call her the next day. She called screaming at me, acting like I was the one who had wronged her, saying that she had worked hard for this trip and that I was being immature. But I didn\u2019t want to be around someone who would humiliate me, especially considering that her own family and friends would be present. I can understand that I ruined the trip for her, but it feels like her own fault.", "created_utc": 1679821753, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/122gn7q/aita_for_leaving_a_trip_early_because_of_my/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s so awful. Please reconsider this relationship. She does not sound like someone that will make you feel safe and loved.", "NTA\n\nYour gf and the rest of them are big time aholes. I am so angry on your behalf, that is absolutely vile behavior. \n\nI admit that I really dislike pranks to begin with. (I promise I'm really a fun person, but pranks have a tendency to go wrong).

You had every right to react as you didn't and any blowback she caught more than deserved.", "NTA at all and I am so sorry that happened to you. That was a huge violation and deliberately not bringing a spare pair is an added layer of malicious from your (hopefully soon ex)-gf. Please dump her and understand most people are kinder than that and you can trust again", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m all for a good prank, but a good prank is only good when everyone can laugh at it.", "NTA, what the FUCK?! That's awful. Imagine if she'd been the one naked around a bunch of strangers?!  \n\n\nDump her, please. You deserve much better.", "NTA\n\nRun far away from this lady. Literally there's nothing more fucked than knowing your boyfriends biggest fear and PLAYING ON IT FOR FUN. \n\nAlso they straight up sexually harassed you with all the comments and all that..", "NTA\n\nI really hope she is now your ex.

Your gf stole your swimming trunks \ud83d\udea9, humiliated you in front of her peers \ud83d\udea9, and she gaslit you when you were upset with her joke \ud83d\udea9.\n\nA joke is funny when the prankster and the person at the receiving end of the joke are laughing too. You weren't laughing because you were humiliated and embarrassed. Her joke was actually bullying which isn't funny. This should be an instant break-up. Good thing you're not married to each other.", "NTA. What she has done was despicable.", "> I (20M) **had** a girlfriend\n\nGood riddance! NTA.", "NTA. Why would she do something that exposes you to literal bodyshaming like that? A funny prank is mixing someones ketchup with hot sauce. Not exposing there baked body without consent.", "NTA \u2013 especially in a place like Queensland (I don't know where specifically, but I presume it's at one of the major tourist centres), these sorts of pranks are nowhere near \"funny\".

Pranks would be fine if they are just under you two for like 5 min if you both agree on it, not the entire day in public.

Since she is angry at you for leaving though she lacks basic empathy and sees no fault with her actions, I wouldn't be able to continue with the relationship until it was very clear to her how much she hurt you and her actually reflecting on it. A relationship is a team effort but apparently she just sees the I in it.", "NTA\n\nIf you ever meet her again rig her underwear so she runs around naked", "And you are with her why mate?", "NTA and I would break up. The only way this would have been even slightly okay is if she had done this while you were alone or with people she knows you're comfortable with AND if she packed clothes for you to put on, also giving them to you in a way where you wouldn't have to expose yourself to anyone. She however considers a joke to humiliate you and make you severely uncomfortable for hours and also letting her family essentially bully you. Then when you express that she crossed a boundary she screamed at you, made herself the victim and said you were immature. That is really telling of her character and not someone i would personally consider being in a relationship with.", "NTA; divorce\n\nFr tho, op you should dump her. If my significant other put me on purpose in a situation to be exposed in public for many to see, I'd feel the same way. I'd be mortified. Its really telling of her,  you don't do that kind of stuff to someone you care abt. You don't make someone feel vulnerable in a flight situation without consent. I'm really sorry this happened to you. Imo you shouldn't forgive her. I wouldn't be able to move past something like this. And how you described her reaction after? Take the trash out. There will be many more ppl in your life that will show you even basic decency and kindness", "Nta.  For the moment lets put aside your embarrasment, I'm not dismissing your feelings as they are completely valid but they are not the main issue here. You could have easily been charged with indecent exposure and ended up on the sex offenders register.\n\nWhile I know some people will say that wasn't her intention, anyone with half a brain knows that a man naked in public is not going to be well received.
