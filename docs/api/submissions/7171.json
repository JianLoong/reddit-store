However maybe your mom misses you that much that just wants short talk because she enjoys spending any bit of time with you? Do you hang out at all with your mom in a month or so?", "OP needs to flat out tell her that the phone will not be answered before x o'clock, so please respect that.  And then tell her if she doesn't, the phone will be turned off at night.  Does he even want her calling during the day while he is working?  (I assume not.)  If that's the case, then a weekly call in the evening or on the weekend should suffice.  Definitely not daily.", "She has a job", "Taking wont help. I've talked to her many times about this. My brother, who lives with his wife, goes to bed early and my mom used to wake him up while he was sleeping with phone calls everyday. He kept asking her to not call but she forgot or ignored him and continued calling. We kind of have to train her to treat us the way we want to be treated. He stopped taking her calls while sleeping and she stopped calling at night. I wish she would treat us with consideration of her own but talking does nothing. We have to train her like a dog, it makes me feel awful but there is no other effective solution. Maybe I'm an asshole for manipulating my mom like that but if she continues unchecked i would rather not have her in my life at all (obviously this isn't the only issue we have and none have improved by having adult conversations where both parties agree).", "I havw discussed with her many times that i would prefer she doesn't wake me up or that she does so more gently.

The plans could be great plans but they are disrespectful of his saying he has plans.\n\nIf he asks friends over to watch a ball game mom is there serving snacks. Obligating his friends to eat or decline due to disliking or not eating certain foods.\n\nA mom missing her child wants to do what she thinks will make her child feel wanted.\nA mom who has no confidence in her child's ability to think for himself and needs her to think for him is by no means a mom who misses her child.", "I see your edit.\nIf you don't think calling him lazy because he doesn't get up when she says to isn't belittling him.. Then that's on you.", ">However maybe your mom misses you that much\n\nI love how naive the responses are from commentors who clearly have normal, well-adjusted parents of their own.\n\nEveryone else on here with toxic parents is going: yup, it's a control thing. It's about invalidating OP's right to make decisions and stomping all over their boundaries, and keeping doing it until OP accepts it because otherwise they might carry on making other, firmer boundaries in the future.\n\nNot having a go at you, PartyKick. It's just a massively different perspective.", "Explain that you are just as capable of getting up and going to work as she is. \n\nIf you want to be sassy, set an alarm to call her late every night to remind her to get up early for work. If she goes to bed before you, it will annoy her.  I'm not necessarily advocating annoying your mom, but some people don't get a message without being this blunt.", "That\u2019s what I mean. Stop talking to her. If she call you at 8:00 am, don\u2019t talk to her at all that day. If she calls you at 8:30 am the next day, same thing. She gets zero communication with you until she respects your request.\n\nWith my mom it was arranging extended family reunions every time I went home. I moved across the country to escape her tactics. \n\nI detest these gatherings. I begged her to stop. I didn\u2019t even know these people and she was just using me as an excuse. I finally blew up at her and told her I wasn\u2019t visiting her again until her until the relatives were all dead. I quit visiting for a few years. She never tried that again.", "NTA:  But you're dad kinda right, you're being inconsiderate.  In your mon strange mind she's doing something to help you. Instead of having an adult conversation about it you're treating her like someone you don't wanna date.  Just ignore her till she get the hint", "I don\u2019t think calling him to wake him up is belittling him, yes it\u2019s annoying as hell but it is his mom. I just wanted to ask him because sometimes mothers miss their children too", "100% that\u2019s why I wanted to know more details about OP\u2019s relationship with his mother", "I have tried talking to her about this issue many times. Many people have said to talk to her about it but if i thought that would work, i would do it. If talking would help this issue would have been solved over a year ago.", "I disagree. I might have misread, but OP already had multiple conversations with their mother explaining that she does not need nor want to be woken up by their mother. Their mother was aware of this, but decided to continue this behavior not only when OP lived with her, but also when she moved out via phone calls. The implication is that the mother doesn't respect OP's set boundaries despite the multiple times that OP has communicated this boundary. Maybe OP could explain the phone call situation with their mother, but I really highly doubt that OP's mother isn't already aware.", "Not good", "Then your options are annoying her by waking her up or continue to ignore her.\n\nYou cannot force another person to change their behavior. The best you can do is change your response and make peace with it.", "Op mentioned her and her mother haven't had a talk since she moved out. So they never had the conversation regarding the phones calls just the waking up when OP lived there. \n\nSo OP has two options.  Talk to her mom and explain \"mom I won't be answering the phone when you call in the morning because it stresses me out\" or continue to ignore her calls \"until she get the hint\".    Personally I think the latter is the way to handle this situation.", "OP could have the conversation with her mother, and I think it would be better to do that, to at least be able to say to the mother in the future when she continues to call OP \"I already explained why I'm not answering your calls.\" But, I doubt the mother will respect that boundary or change her behavior because she never did when OP lived with their mother. But, I don't think it's inconsiderate for OP stonewall her mother/to *not* have that conversation, because OP has already had that conversation with their mother when OP lived with their mother. She has already had that conversation multiple times, so I don't think it would be inconsiderate for the daughter to not have that conversation again, and again, and again etc.", "Maybe i phrased it oddly but i did say that i do return her calls just not before 11am.

I am so tired of reading about entitled parents pulling petty sh\\*t on their adult kids because they think being a parent has earned them the right. To begin with your dad is NOT neutral in the fight. He is taking your mother's side. Stick to your guns and don't answer. Your an adult living on your own supporting yourself.

After a couple episodes she will see it.", "Im 26", "NTA Your mom is an ass and stupid for not understanding how work can be any hour of the day\n\nI forgot to add - Are you not using Do Not Disturb to silence her calls?

Parents/partners who call/text and expect immediate response are not worried, they just want to control you.
