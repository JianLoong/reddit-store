Your ex has to explain to his child that he can't afford nicer things where as someone else is paying for nicer things for that kids brother. It isn't hard or not understandable... kids get it if you explain it. Parents just don't like explaining they can't provide something they want to provide. \n\nYou sent your kid to school with school supplies... your ex provided zero of those school supplies.... your ex has told you that he was going to attempt to take your son's school supplies to give to his other child who he can't afford supplies for. \n\nIt's tough when kids have to deal with inequality at a young age. It's important that you teach your son humility and generosity but also to stand up for himself as well. You're never gonna be the asshole for not buying some random kid school supplies... but be careful with your son about the messages your son learns about the difference.", "NTA\n\nI feel bad for the girl, she deserves better parents.\n\n The money your ex isn't contributing to your son should be spent on his daughter instead.

He can get a second job.  He can ask family for money.  He can sell some possessions. He can dip into his retirement money.  He can get rid of cable. He can switch to generic brands.  He can learn how to count cards in Vegas. He can start an Etsy store.  \n \nIts 100% true that the kids having unequal stuff will cause problems between them.

Your ex decided to cheat and have another child. It was her mother who decided to abondon her. You don't have to make up for their poor choices.", "NTA\nYour ex isn't \"sad\" for his daughter. He's greedy and jealous. If he cared about her feelings, he'd discourage comparisons between how her mom treats her and how you care for your son. He'd devote some of HIS time, energy and resources to make up for her lack of a second engaged parent. He's got her by herself half the time. How is he showing her the kind of attention and care you're giving your son at the very same time?\n\nHe's got quite the nerve to suggest YOU take over some parental duties for his affair child.

Not your circus, not your illegitimate and neglected monkey.", "NTA. His responsibility to each child doesn't go away no matter how many children he creates. Its a *him* thing - not a *you* thing. He can confuse the issue with what's fair.

He's not a stray dog, after all just watering all the lawns with his random seeds. He created an imbalance and he wants you to accept him doing less so he can focus more on his five-year-old and keep some pocket money. Had he remained in a relationship with you, this would be a shared concern. But, it ain't no more. \n\nSucks for him. Every parent I have ever met knows that kids are an expensive habit to undertake.

Maybe he needs to look into resources available to him.\n\nNTA Is he going to ask you to be her mom next because she doesn't understand why her brother has a mom and she doesn't? Do your parents need to buy her gifts? It's his job to make sure his kid feels loved and cared for, no one else's. If he needs more money, he should be spending his time tracking her mother down, not harassing you.", "NTA. You\u2019re not meant to work out this together. All you should do is take care of your son. His AP\u2019s daughter is not your responsibility. Yea she\u2019s an innocent child but you\u2019re innocent as well.

It's a sad but true fact of life that some children have more than others because their parents are able to give them more than others.\nEach of these kids has one parent.

But that is on him to figure out, not OP. OP provides for her son when he is in her care and the ex-husband provided for their son in his care\u2014he is still obligated to provide that care.", "So she should deprive her kid cause her ex's affair baby is jealous?? Are you serious? So they won't have a relationship... oh, no. Op's son won't be best buds with his dad's affair kid. I'm sure he'd rather have the stuff op provides him with than a relationship with the girl.", "I\u2019d say it\u2019s the father who set up his daughter and son for a lifetime of family drama. OPs dealing with a shitty ex and situation. Hence NTA", "There is no point made about sharing in the post. The ex wants OP to buy stuff for his child too which she doesn\u2019t have to do. She doesn\u2019t have to deprive her son of things and opportunities just because his half sibling can\u2019t have those things. When they make about the same amount of money and OP is the one buying things for her son then the ex should have money to spend on his daughter. If he is nit spending on his son, doesn\u2019t have enough for her daughter, where is his money going? His money management issues are not OP\u2019s to solve."]}
