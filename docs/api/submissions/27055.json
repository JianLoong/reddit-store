Your ex has to explain to his child that he can't afford nicer things where as someone else is paying for nicer things for that kids brother. It isn't hard or not understandable... kids get it if you explain it. Parents just don't like explaining they can't provide something they want to provide. \n\nYou sent your kid to school with school supplies... your ex provided zero of those school supplies.... your ex has told you that he was going to attempt to take your son's school supplies to give to his other child who he can't afford supplies for. \n\nIt's tough when kids have to deal with inequality at a young age. It's important that you teach your son humility and generosity but also to stand up for himself as well. You're never gonna be the asshole for not buying some random kid school supplies... but be careful with your son about the messages your son learns about the difference.", "NTA\n\nI feel bad for the girl, she deserves better parents.\n\n The money your ex isn't contributing to your son should be spent on his daughter instead.

He can get a second job.  He can ask family for money.  He can sell some possessions. He can dip into his retirement money.  He can get rid of cable. He can switch to generic brands.  He can learn how to count cards in Vegas. He can start an Etsy store.  \n \nIts 100% true that the kids having unequal stuff will cause problems between them.

He's greedy and jealous. If he cared about her feelings, he'd discourage comparisons between how her mom treats her and how you care for your son. He'd devote some of HIS time, energy and resources to make up for her lack of a second engaged parent. He's got her by herself half the time. How is he showing her the kind of attention and care you're giving your son at the very same time?\n\nHe's got quite the nerve to suggest YOU take over some parental duties for his affair child.

He's not a stray dog, after all just watering all the lawns with his random seeds. He created an imbalance and he wants you to accept him doing less so he can focus more on his five-year-old and keep some pocket money. Had he remained in a relationship with you, this would be a shared concern. But, it ain't no more. \n\nSucks for him. Every parent I have ever met knows that kids are an expensive habit to undertake.

Maybe he needs to look into resources available to him.\n\nNTA Is he going to ask you to be her mom next because she doesn't understand why her brother has a mom and she doesn't? Do your parents need to buy her gifts? It's his job to make sure his kid feels loved and cared for, no one else's. If he needs more money, he should be spending his time tracking her mother down, not harassing you.", "NTA. You\u2019re not meant to work out this together. All you should do is take care of your son. His AP\u2019s daughter is not your responsibility. Yea she\u2019s an innocent child but you\u2019re innocent as well.

It's a sad but true fact of life that some children have more than others because their parents are able to give them more than others.\nEach of these kids has one parent.

Likely the boy also has grandmas or other maternal relatives in this country whereas the little girl doesn\u2019t. Grandparents are often the source of toys and gifts and dad needs to get his family and his girl\u2019s family involved if he needs help. Most grandmas roll happily kick in for gymnastics class or whatever. \n\nNote:,I find it somewhat hard to believe that a five year old is so discerning as to understand comparative backpack \u201cquality.\u201d A cheap Pokemon or whatever Barbie backpack from Target is going to make a little girl quite delighted, she\u2019s not typically going to know or care that her brother has one from REI or Nike that cost more. School supplies go to school and stay there so how is she allegedly comparing his pencils and markers to hers? Mom had to drag them over to dad\u2019s house first to make sure she saw them?\n\n\nKindergarteners in any case don\u2019t need the same supplies as third graders so that makes that pretty easy to explain. You get what you get and the teacher has extra stuff. It\u2019s not a big deal unless somebody is making it a big deal. \n\nFive year olds also typically don\u2019t need or want to do the same kind and amount of extracurriculars as an 8 year old. How does the KID know her brother is getting to do more? Dad complaining about it? He\u2019s looking for trouble. \n\nSibling rivalry is a thing every family endures and has to deal with, younger kids always think the older one is getting more of everything and wanting to do the same and get the same, and you have to explain to them that he is older and you get other things, your time will come. \n\nDad seems to have the problem and as much glee OP is having in gloating that her son has better things than his sister etc it\u2019s not likely that situation is going to change based on her contributing anything. \n\nLittle sis - and more to the point, her father- will have to accept at some point that she has one parent and one income and his ex wife isn\u2019t going to fill that gap regardless of the guilt trip. He gets two children and she only gets one, and with that privilege of rss as using a second child  comes a greater financial burden. He may also be the nicer and more fun parent or something else that evens things out. \n\nHe can always rent out a room or move his girlfriend in and then he\u2019ll have more cash if it\u2019s really such a problem in the future, but kindergarten seems kind of early to be worrying. \n\nHe must have known his daughter\u2019s mom\u2019s name at some point snd known where she was from. During her pregnancy and childbirth at the hospital he never saw her passport, driver\u2019s license? Her mom never called or sent a text or email from the UK? People don\u2019t just disappear. \n\nGetting in contact with her or her family via social media etc might be a way to get a few hundred bucks from time to time to bump up the little girl\u2019s wardrobe /dance class etc needs.", "No, her son is due his fair share from his father as the courts have adjudicated. SHe's ensuring nothing. The courts took all the factors in account.", "Let him get creative with his finances without dumping on OP. Not her problem. He should not get another dime from her for his other child.", "The courts took that into consideration when allotting CS , or no CS in this case.\n\nThis is not punishment for infractions, it is a complete lack of responsibility to his other child on the part of OP. If ex does choose to have 4 kids, per your example, he can hardly go whining to OP to try to make her subsidize all his spawn. Let someone else more closely connected to those kids care about them, not their father's ex wife."]}
