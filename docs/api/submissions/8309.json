Follow the track she took in this:\n\n-\"I'm coming and bringing sibling's child.\" Establishes the baseline for what she wants.\n\n-You tell her \"sorry mom, we aren't inviting the family, just school friends. Our reason is so we don't have to worry about inviting everyone.\" You reasonably decline her request, and provide your reasoning.\n\n-she begins trying to negotiate, searching for a loophole to get what she wants. When told no, she declares she is simply going to do it. By this point the request has turned into a demand.\n\n-you say no, more assertively.\n\n-with bargaining *and* demanding having failed, she drops the pretense and gets angry.\n\nIt's a classic manipulation tactic. She wanted something and you said no, so since she didn't care about your choice, she started trying to find loopholes like the Jurassic Park raptors testing the fences. When her increasingly unrealistic ideas failed, she got angry and lashed out. That's meant to make you feel bad and give in just to soothe the conflict she stirred up.", "NTA\n\nYour child is 6, unless he's regularly interacting with these relatives, he's not going to miss their participation.
