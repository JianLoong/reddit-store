But those few that did feel the need to call attention to my speech impediment achieved nothing except sapping my confidence, thereby making future presentations tangibly worse because I was now nervous, embarrassed and self conscious and struggling to make eye contact and speak up. Strangely I didn't develop the sudden ability to correctly make the sound because they decided to make a big deal of it. Instead they did the exact opposite of what a teacher should do.

It's very much like when I was younger, I always did a click sound after a c or k sound. The impact of the sensory issue had a lasting affect which resulted in the incorrect pronunciation of the sound.", "Yeah, just when the question is whether the teacher should mark them down, I don't think the reason for the mispronunciation matters. Either the teacher can gently help the kid explore avenues to change it or they can do nothing. By sixteen anyone who has a speech impediment is well aware of it anyway and probably has already done what they could to change it.\n\n(I also went to speech therapy for the \"th\" sound but my problem was just that I thought it was another way of saying \"f\" (like \"ph\") so once corrected it wasn't an issue or really worth the speech therapy.)", "It does hurt them.  They just don't realize it.\n\nI grew up with this issue.  My tongue is too big for my mouth and my facial  muscles required a few surgeries.  Several years of speech therapy.\n\nI get treated like I am a lesser   I am not allowed to interact with customers at my job.  I had a hard time getting a job due to my impediment.  OP thinks nobody can tell the difference much but they can.  I guess they have more polite people on their social circle. \n\nI got mocked and bullied.  People don't like talking to me, either.\n\nEmployers judge, interviewers judge, other people judge.  I heard one person said that I must have grew up in a trash can.\n\nAnd I am waaaay older than OP.  I have been dealing with this for over 40 years of my life.", "Eh, at that age in my English Language classes we were marked down for mispronounced words during presentations, the same way we would be marked down for misspelling of words in written assignments. (This was in England.) \n\nI just tried to Google the current syllabus and it seems to be relatively the same now. I wonder what allowances would be made for OP in this situation, for example someone with anxiety would be allowed to present privately but would still need to present or be marked down. Hmmm."]}
