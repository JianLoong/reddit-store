Your teacher is way out of line, and I recommend having your parents advocate for you through school administration.\nYour teacher should not be deducting marks for something non-academic, and unrelated to the class material being taught.\n\nETA You hit the nail on the head when you commented about her need to reconsider teaching a diverse group of students. She may be fine teaching a homogenous group of neurological kids (doubtful, but maybe), but she does not have the right toolkit to manage a classroom that includes neurodiversity of any sort.", "NTA, but I have to ask: do you have an IEP? If you have a documented condition that requires accommodation and she is denying it, report her.", "NTA. As an English teacher, she has no right to mark you down unless you\u2019re also spelling the words incorrectly - what you\u2019re describing should be treated similarly to a speech impediment, which you wouldn\u2019t punish a student for having.\n\nIt also sounds like this teacher doesn\u2019t understand sensory sensitivities - if it\u2019s something documented you could get written accommodation for, it could be helpful now and w other difficult teachers in the future. Good luck!!", "I had a student a few years ago who came in wearing his button down shirt inside out, I took one look at him, sent him in the hallway, and said, \"the tag is bothering you.\" He said yes. I went to my desk and got my seam-ripper and sent him to the bathroom. He would rather endure kids making fun of him than feeling the tag. Any time he had a new shirt after that he would come to me and ask for the seam-ripper. The struggle is real. \n\nThe teacher should have been more understanding and supportive. Her reaction confuses me. I can understand her asking but to call your explanation ridiculous? I know you're nearing the end of high school, but your parents and you could look into getting a 504 plan. The accommodation would be that you can't be penalized for anything related to your sensory issues (like points off on an oral presentation). Then you wouldn't have to explain, you could just tell the teacher she should have received a copy of your 504 plan.\n\nNTA", "INFO: do you have a documented condition?

One of the MOST noticeable things about the Irish accent is the use of T instead of TH. \n\nBut honestly, your teacher is a jerk, you should be able to say you have a neurological reason, and have them leave you alone without having to give any specifics.", "NTA, and if she actually takes points away then\u2026consider bringing this situation to a guidance counselor/dean/higher authority", "NTA your pronunciation isn't hurting anyone and her being so judgemental about sensory issues is a terrible thing for a teacher.

Otherwise perhaps a guidance counselor or something.", "NTA\n\nTell your parents and have them email the admin with your conversation.\n\nTeachers do this about and at times they even skip over kids IEP out of arrogance. Thankfully you\u2019re strong in self and can handle it (kudos), but other kids may not. Report please (mom of a kid with needs).\n\nIn addition, the teacher can make your life and grading harder. You don\u2019t deserve that animosity on you.", "NTA. Either way people can understand what you're telling them, so whether it sounds like \"the\" or \"d\" or \"t\" it does not matter.

I can maybe understand the teacher may have wanted you to speak more clearly considering you were doing a presentation, but it\u2019s really such a minor issue. Everyone could understand you fine and she clearly was not interested in trying to understand your sensory issue better, as a teacher should do (in my opinion).", "NTA. I don\u2019t believe you are acting entitled. If you have a diagnosis or IEP, then her reaction and docking your grade should be reported. Even if you don\u2019t have a diagnosis or IEP, she is not correct in lowering your grade.

It's neurological. Think of it this way: is there something that makes you cringe? Like a sound (knife on a plate or something similar), the feeling of a certain type of thing on your skin (wet socks on your feet for example)? Just something that is so fucking ick to you so you avoid it. That's a sensory issue. Neurodivergent people have these issues with a ton of things that don't bother others, and not just that, the feeling you get from whatever it is is super magnified, so you avoid it at all costs. The feeling can make you nauseated or irrationally angry and it is often painful too. It's just part of your life and you accommodate it and hope others around you do to, like any other kind of disability. It can't be fixed, only lived with as well as possible.\n\nThis is the everyday life of autistic people, ppl with ADHD or Sensory disorders. It's my life and my parents did their best to modify my \"behavior\" thru ass beatings and gaslighting and verbal abuse. Unfortunately many parents go this route."]}
