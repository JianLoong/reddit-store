The teacher laughed and from that day in came up with an entirely new way to teach her students how to spell because that incident made her realize that words sound differently to each student.\n\nEdit to add judgement: NTA", "NTA. I had speech therapy as a kid for this exact issue. It\u2019s a disability and teacher is an ass.", "NTA She should never have asked you about this in the first place! My niece has a hard time with the th and pronunciation. My sister tried everything to help her and tried to get her into speech therapy but they refused because she did not have 3 letters that she mispronounced. Except, that she does. She also has a hard time with l and r. She is 13 and extremely hard to understand when she talks. Everyone has to ask her to repeat stuff constantly and it sounds like she has a mouth full of marbles. The word three is said tree, the word the is duh. She literally cannot help this and has had no professional help because THE SCHOOL refused to help her or acknowledge the problem. I would feel so bad if someone brought this up to her like that. It is in no way her choice or fault.", "NTA, well done for standing up for yourself. You need to tell your parents so they can take this teacher to task because she is being discriminatory towards you.\n\nWithout going into detail I had a similar incident when I was a kid with a maths teacher, it was humiliating and I didn't handle myself as well as you, but I did tell my parents and my mum took him to task (he actually ran from the classroom because she scared him) and spoke to the principal about it all and I was never treated differently again.", "NTA. Let me get this straight. A valid and medical reason to mispronounce words is entitled? No matter the reason, mispronouncing things is not an entitlement problem. Why is she taking this personally? She's a teacher! How horrible for a teacher to be so self focused and immature!", "As unfair as it might be, and as much as your teacher\u2019s approach was horrendous, I am concerned that this speech habit will cause you problems going forward. When you are sitting in a job interview, you are judged on a lot of things and a speech impediment isn\u2019t going to help you. First impressions are huge. I would recommend dealing with the underlying issue as this will affect you long term.", "I had to admit I was struggling to understand why this would be problem for OP when I know people who speak like this just as part of their accent. NTA the teacher is being weirdly strict.\n\nBased on other comments OP has made, maybe in the future another option to the accent reason they should say \"I have a speech impediment and have worked with a Speech therapist for 2 years and nothing more can be done about it\"", "Spot on! College admissions and prospective employers will all hear the difference and few, if any, will bother to ask if it\u2019s an issue.", "OP is neurodiverse to with sensory issues. And you are seriously tell her \u201cyou should consider how badly this reflects on you when thinking about whether you should move past this.\u201d How do you you suggests OP moves past the physiology of her brain? A brain transplant? \n\nYou\u2019re view is very ableist. You think it\u2019s not okay to have a neurodiverse brain and therefore it\u2019s okay to discriminate against neurodivergent people because they should get over themselves and act neurotypical for your comfort.\n\nAnd being neurodivergent doesn\u2019t mean OP doesn\u2019t know her pronunciation is different and it also doesn\u2019t mean she has low IQ. Your suggestion \u201cyou may literally be incapable of understanding\u201d is demeaning and again ableist.", "Hearing it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a problem. It\u2019s an \u201caccent\u201d even if not for the usual reason. I work in communications, accents aren\u2019t an issue when the content is intelligible.", ">'its not my issue if you get bent out of shape, maybe you shouldn't be a teacher'.\n\nI would say that OP's response was pretty spot on (though obviously you've paraphrased). If someone's actions make them unfit for a role *that* is the kind of behaviour that should get them fired. Not the person pointing it out.", "But WHY is it such an issue? I don't have sensory issues, but I can't say the R sound correctly (in my native language). It's a physical issue, no amount of speech therapy is going to help - I'd actually have to have minor surgery on my mouth to be able to say it correctly. Should I also have to cut up my mouth because by not doing so I'm being complacent and not 'pushing myself' enough?", "Probably said I'll give you detention, but either didn't follow through (I had a teacher who did that constantly) or the letter hasn't been sent home because now in days detention has to be scheduled with the parents so there is someone to pick them up (that's why lunch detentions are more common now)", "lol, so she can talk to me however she wants and belittle me for answering a question she asked but as soon as i stand up for myself i\u2019m the bad guy? i don\u2019t care lmao.  if you\u2019re not going to attempt to be understanding towards neurodivergence and the symptoms that go along with it i don\u2019t want you as my boss.  gladly find a new job bc people like that should not be in positions of authority.", "Yeah, what about Thomas! Oh, wait...", "I don't think this teacher has exhibited any behavior that would warrant them being fired- her job is to assess her students english skills, and that is what she has done. If OP had a recognised disability that the school was aware of, then the teacher would certainly be aware of that. Evidently OP does not, or the teacher would not have asked.\n\nAnd regardless of whether you think OP is in the right or not, she is a student. The correct course of action would have been to bite her tongue (presuming that doesn't 'give her the ick' too), and speak to her parent/guardian about what happened. Instead, she decided to tackle it herself, talking back to her teacher. At that point, it really didn't matter if she was right or wrong- she was questioning her teacher's authority. If her teacher allowed her to get away with this without disciplining her, she would be setting a dangerous precedent to her and all of her peers- her classes would be more likely to be disrupted, and the end result would be that her students would suffer.", "It is a hurdle though and something you will be judged for as an adult in a professional setting.  Is it fair? No but it is life and if it's something that is preventable or fixable it could be worth it. And maybe it's not fixable but then atleast you know. \n\n\nSomeone used an example of the word teeth. By your own post you either say teet or teed and neither  of those sound like the actual word you're trying to say. Same tmwith though (tough sounds more like toe)", "If OP is happy to go through life triggered by the idea  of \u201cth\u201d on their tongue, it\u2019s noting to me, was just tinking it might be wort looking into.", "She's not right for what she did and her minimizing your issues, BUT you've got to find a happy medium of being assertive whilst not saying something that can backfire on you. \n\nI'm neurodivergent myself, simply giving realistic advice.", "What\u2019s your diagnosis if you\u2019re alleging ableism?", "It's not really that weird. Think about languages like French that don't have those sounds in them at all, so people never learn to make them. Most people with a French accent do what OP does, but it doesn't bother you because you expect it.", "Eye contact is in most English rubrics for speeches though?", "Even cultural diversity would be a factor here. Eye contact doesn't mean the same thing to everyone.", "Yeah that's the thing, correcting pronunciation is part of English Language lessons. Teacher was right to ask in private and not in front of the class, but it wasn't right to challenge that reason with the kid.

Not be combative with a literal child.\n\n\nNTA", ">her job is to assess her students english skills,\n\nPenalising a student for a speech impediment is discriminatory, not an indicator of OPs English skills. \n\nAnd the idea that authority can never be questioned? That way lies madness (or at the very least, authoritarian dictatorships).\n\n>The correct course of action would have been to bite her tongue (presuming that doesn't 'give her the ick' too),\n\nThis is massively facetious.

The French and Irish accents are especially challenging for me. My last boss was Irish and I just nodded my way through meetings. \n\n\n\n\n\nTotally agree that this does seem like a change that makes sense when you consider other accents. I hadn\u2019t considered it fully.", "This is comparable to docking someone's PE grade because they broke their leg last week and can't currently participate.", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. Some people are not able to do the things necessary to get an A in a subject, no matter how hard they try. It might be better to get them into an ungraded system, but that doesn\u2019t provide the external measure of ability that grades are supposed to be used for. It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t get an A on something and can\u2019t do it. Pretending you can with an A creates the problem that people expect you to have abilities and knowledge you don\u2019t have.", "If the grade is based on performance in the race, an alternate activity could be assigned to students physically unable to run.\n\nLikewise, if the student giving the presentation was unable to present due to a disability, they could be given an alternate assignment. At some point though, we have to admit that a student who is, for example, mute and unable to use assistive speaking devices and who has anxiety about public performance of any kind and who is not able to make eye contact, cannot be given an A for a speech they were not able to perform in a public speaking class. That sucks, but life is fundamentally unfair.", "As someone with sensory issues, no amount of therapy can fix the physical reaction my body has to some textures or feelings.", "It's high school English.  Not debate.  It is a core subject required by law to be taken by every student.  Their grade should not depend on their ability to enunciate in an way and accent the teacher prefers.  The grade should be based on the conveyed grasp of the material, not how they pronounce something.  Just like ESL high school students shouldn't have points docked because they have an accent and can't clearly pronounce certain sounds because those don't exist in their native language.  Taking points off for that is just bigoted - nothing to do with lacking in knowledge.", "Okay but what does someone's ability to make a particular sound have to do with their ability to give a good oral presentation? If OP has given a good, clear, well put together presentation who cares if she's very slightly mispronounced a few words? Marking her down on that wouldn't provide an external measure of her ability in that class, it would provide an external measure of her ability to conform to her teachers idea of 'normal'. \n\nI have verbal dyspraxia, I didn't speak coherently until the age of 7 and then only with A LOT of speech therapy. I still have problems with particular sounds and th sounds are my biggest struggle. Like OP I usually pronounce a th more like a d and like OP I've found 90% of people either don't notice or don't comment. It certainly doesn't impede anyone's ability to understand me.\n\nBack in the days when I had to give oral presentations in school and university most of my teachers focused on the quality of my work and presentation, not my slightly odd pronunciations. But those few that did feel the need to call attention to my speech impediment achieved nothing except sapping my confidence, thereby making future presentations tangibly worse because I was now nervous, embarrassed and self conscious and struggling to make eye contact and speak up. Strangely I didn't develop the sudden ability to correctly make the sound because they decided to make a big deal of it. Instead they did the exact opposite of what a teacher should do. Instead of building my confidence and guiding me to improve in areas where I could they made me measurably worse at public speaking. I'm in my late 20s now and I'm only just getting to the place where I can stand speaking in front of people.\n\nI'm not saying teachers shouldn't grade on ability, but the focus should be on things that actually matter, not perfectly harmless quirks and differences. OP is right, if this teacher's aim is to produce cookie cutter robots who all perform a task well in exactly the same way, rather than a diverse group of young people who know how to play to their strengths then she shouldn't be teaching.", "OP is neurodiverse. They pronounce one phoneme differently. It does not affect their understanding of or ability to present the material. They are not failing to perform. They are being penalised for what they are.\n\nIn the analogy I made, OP's \"alternative assignment\" is that they speak as they normally would and the teacher stops being an dismissive, ableist AH *because that is the appropriate accommodation to make*.", "Right! I'm a foreign language teacher, and when students give presentations I do expect them to look toward the audience rather than stare at their notes or their slides the whole time, because that shows they're speaking, not reading. But I would never expect them to make actual eye contact with anyone. As a teacher, you can grade on various aspects of public speaking while also allowing for neurodiversity and just different speaking styles.", "No, because even if your presentation skills are only mediocre, that doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t able to transmit information at all. Probably someone exactly like you but able to pronounce words more clearly would be able to communicate a bit better, but you\u2019re probably able to do a good job.", "It's an English class. Correct punctuation should be a given. It may not be necessary to the grade in history class, but in English, it should be expected even if it's not explicitly stated. \n\nPersonally, I think her parents did a disservice by not getting her either speech therapy or sensory therapy when they found out why she didn't like saying them. Therapy could help her to manage saying \"th\" words without feeling sick. I'm also surprised that no other teacher before now said anything.\n\nIt's a good thing English isn't a tonal language.", "Teacher is an AH I agree. But for the cute accent that the French have, it\u2019s not so great when they have to say third. Trust me, my husband is French Canadian and a lot of people think he\u2019s talking about \ud83d\udca9 in circumstances where both can apply. \n\nStill OP is NTA.", "This is a very ableist view. Some neurotypical people need to accept neurodiverse people exist instead of forcing neurodiverse people to not be themselves and acting like neurotypicals want them to act.", "French Canadian tongue twister:  after he tasted Thuringer on Thursday he had to turd for the third time.", "Neurodiverse people are going to suffer brcause they do have an impediment in that they are different.its not ableist,its just reality that if op could mitigate her condition,she will have a lot easier time in life.", "OP is brushing off speech therapy and CBT to address their underlying issues in feeling sick/anxious when having to speak, though. You\u2019re comparing apples to oranges.", "I think it could be problematic if they have to speak to people with TH in their names. It could come off insulting to people who aren\u2019t familiar with OP to be called Deresa or Timody.", "That\u2019s fine, each teacher or institution can have its own criteria to some degree.", "While some words have several acceptable pronunciations, that doesn\u2019t mean any and every possible variant is correct. For example, pronouncing the word \u201cbag\u201d as if it was spelled b-l-a-r-g would be incorrect everywhere.", "A presentation is a form of communication.\n\nDifferent people have different abilities when it comes to communication. Part of communication depends on the audience\u2019s abilities as well.\n\nIt\u2019s okay not to be able to communicate with perfect accuracy, but the point is to be effective.", "Yes, grading performance IS ableist. It literally is supposed to measure ability.", "Thanks for pointing this out! I was thinking the same. It\u2019s a very ableist view indeed.", "Neurodivergent people only suffer if others make them suffer (in regards to OP\u2019s context). OP isn\u2019t able to change the physiology of her brain, just like a person with one leg isn\u2019t able to grow a second one."]}
