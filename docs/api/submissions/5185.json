OP is completely understandable, she just sounds like she has a very mild and limited accent. It doesn't matter that her tongue can do the action and her brain is the body part that can't handle making the sound. She shouldn't need to be making herself gag and feel like vomiting just because her completely understandable speech makes other people mildly surprised because they expect it to sound slightly different. All the teacher needs to do to accommodate this student's brain that tortures her for making one particular sound is... absolutely nothing. Instead, the teacher is going out of her way to call attention to it, demanding an explanation like she's owed one, calling the student a liar, and threatening to grade her down for not being built the same as the other students and not being willing to suffer serious discomfort to APPEAR the same. She's not the same, and it hurts no one to just let her be herself comfortably. The teacher is making her life more difficult solely because she has this disability, and that's really ablist and horrid.", "Sensory issues. Not anxiety.", "It's absolutely horrible. It's inaccurate and offensive as hell.", "The whole section where you're going \"dis and dat\". Where I'm from that's typically used to mock two groups of people - BIPOC and Disabled people. It's thankfully faded more out of use as I've grown up, but it was used a lot when I was a kid to disparage BIPOC in a mostly white town.", "Their sensory issues are causing extreme anxiety for them, though. Did you read how they wrote about their fear of saying th words? OP would benefit from CBT to manage the way they handle their issues.", "They developed a fear *because* it is a sensory issue with physical symptoms. That's a rational fear, not something that can be therapied away. Using \"th\" makes them feel nauseous, fluorescent lights give them a headache - anyone rational would develop aversions to those circumstances.\n\nNow maybe they would benefit from talking to an expert in sensory issues to see if there's any approach that would help, but that's not your call, and it's certainly not an anxiety problem.", "HoH here. Quirky pronunciation does hurt people. Especially if they fail to understand what your saying. It limits you a ton especially the 'th' sound in English. I say that as someone who when tired or talking fast turns 'r' into 'w' and 'th' into 'f'. Therapy, speech or otherwise is a good idea to fix this.", "I actually mostly agree with you, but I just want to point out that it's absolutely not rational to have a fear of such a basic thing as how to make a commonly used sound. We don't have to think about stuff in terms of rational or irrational in this case, what matters is her experience. And right now her anxiety and her aversion is extremely high. Experiencing fear because you _might_ be exposed to one of your sensory triggers is something you do actually have to manage in the world when you have a sensory issue that's that common. Unfortunately we live in a world that isn't built for nerdivergent folks.\n\nI understand why people think she might need to see an SLP or an OT but I don't think that's the type of therapy she would benefit most rum in this case, but just normal psychotherapy because it's the distress that needs to be addressed. And it sounds like it hasn't at all, which means that like a lot of girls, she's getting ignored and lost in the system. Things are getting better, but not that long ago, we were something like 10 times more likely to recognize boys who might be autistic or have ADHD than girls, just as an example of how underserved neurodivergent girls are.\n\nIt sucks that she has to go through a formal process, but the sooner she starts it the better. Making sure she has a diagnosis and documentation will likely hugely benefit her if she decides to go to college.", "You cannot get rid of sensory issues. Im touch averse for this reason and the feeling makes me not like touching so when people touch me,I do feel uncomfortable. Theres no way for me to get rid of this,I cant just \"get used\" to touching. People should probably not touch people without asking if its ok. It is very awkward. I feel pretty uncomfortable for awhile after too.", "Yeah, except this is exactly the same level of life impact as having a lisp. \n\n...You do know that a lisp can be generally be helped in speech therapy, too, don't you? Why does one resolveable pronunciation difference get a pass from you, while OP's does not?\n\nThe question is always whether the solution is worse than the problem. That's something that only OP can decide for herself.", "That\u2019s not how occupational therapy works. It doesn\u2019t \u201ccure\u201d you of being neurodivergent, it helps you find ways of managing your symptoms (such as using an alternative pronunciation if a sound is difficult or uncomfortable, for example)"]}
