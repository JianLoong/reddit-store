You and your husband are amazing people for taking care of her like shes your own!\nYour family is a package-deal, ALL kids included. All they have to do, is accept that. \nNTA", "NTA. I don't understand your family. If anyone in my family brought along a random child (let alone extended family) they would be included as one of our own. That's just what you do.", "You're not wrong. You're an amazing person and mother to your 10 year old and the rest. Please don't change. You're exactly who she needs on her team, and an incredible role model to all 4. Your parents should take note - and be proud. Since they won't, I'm proud of you! \n\nNTA. Could not possibly be.", "NTA your family is. That\u2019s horrible that they don\u2019t except her. She\u2019s a child that obviously needs a family that cares about her no matter what in her life and they can\u2019t accept that that\u2019s on them.", "NTA.  Parenting is about so much more than making a baby through sex.   You clearly think of this kid as your own.  Kudos to you for insisting your family treat them as such or not have access to any of your kids.", "NTA\n\nYour family are really vile and disgusting. Your 10 year old is not just your SIL, she is one of your kids. I am so glad that you stood up for her because it seems she might really need that love and support she gets from you.\n\nPeople that could treat an innocent and dear little child like that really do my head in. I don't know what their problem is but whatever it is, it is vicious and who knows where and when they might turn on any of your children.", "NTA not they are taking themselves out of the picture and if they want to see the grandkids they can come over and sleep on your couch whilst all your kids get to sleep in beds.", "NTA. did your grandparents have these values? Not to be religious, but what religion says, let's not have compassion for others.", "NTA. Stick to your guns OP! Your parents are acting terribly and I agree with everyone saying that people like that are better off out of your kids lives anyway.", "Uh, they don\u2019t need to have anything to do with any of your kids. There\u2019s no law that requires you to see bio family a certain number of times a year. Family is who you choose it to be and you\u2019ve made it clear this child is your child. Either they respect the decision that you have made or they don\u2019t get to see you.", "No, they don't need to have to do anything with her. \n\nThey also don't need to do anything with your bio kids either.", "Well aren't they good people.  NTA", "NTA.  They are doing this to themselves.  Sounds like you are a great and loving parent.  You told them the deal, it's up to them.", "Then they don't need to have anything to do with you either since they are rejecting those who you love. What a weird boundary.", "They don't need to have anything to do with you either then. No matter what they say, she is family. Not just biologically, because she is your husband's sister, but because she is also your chosen family. Technically even, she is an aunt to your kids.  Anyway that you choose to define \"family\" she is a part of yours. \n\nYour husband isn't biologically your family either, would they treat him poorly because of that? You were blessed with what I assume are beautiful and awesome children, but if you weren't and you had adopted a child, would that child be any less family?\n\nAnyone who thinks a piece of paper is what makes a family doesn't need to be around yours.\n\nAnd honestly, thank you for being a great parent. Thank you for taking her in, and treating her with the same love you treat the rest of your kids. She is so lucky to have you in her corner.", "Would they change their stance if you do legally adopt her( I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s an option)? Or are they hung up on the biologically part?", "Your children don't need an extended family which will teach them by every word or action that it's OK to treat kids differently. Whatever they'll say to them, things like \"but we'll always like you because you're our blood\" won't take, them seeing one of their siblings treated as a Cinderella will. You're 100% correct as a parent saying \"everyone or no one\".\n\nAlso, it's not you taking away their family (you're willing to go). It's the extended family which doesn't want to accept your kids. It's on them.", "I'm sure you don't want your kids to learn that crappy behavior should be acceptable just because \"family\". You insisting that your daughter be invited AND made to feel welcome tells me that you know your parents well. If they cave and invite her, but treat her poorly, your kids will see that and take note.", "You didn't take away anything, OP. You set a reasonable boundary and THEY have opted out because THEY are not getting their way.\n\nThis is entirely on them. If they really cannot bring themselves to be nice to a 10 year old girl, they're not fit to be around your other children. \nThat's their choice. All of this is their choice.\n\nAll they had to do was treat a 10 YEAR OLD GIRL with dignity and respect, and have both failed and refused to do so. \n\nYou need to consider if you want people who can bully a child around your children at all. I certainly wouldn't. They're not good enough.", "You are not taking them away. Your family is making the choice to forego a relationship with their grandchildren because they don\u2019t want the 10yo at their home. This was their decision not yours. If they really loved and wanted to see their grandchildren they wouldn\u2019t let this stop their visit. Thank you for not punishing the 10 yo because she isn\u2019t your biological child. You\u2019re doing a good job protecting her from unfair treatment.", "Ensure they know in advance that any direct or passive-aggressive comments or criticisms of your 10-year-old family member will result in immediate expulsion from your home. However, if you doubt they will follow this instruction, it may be better not to try.\n\nBTW, I'm the honorary grandma to three little boys next door. They get greetings, words of praise, listened to, and gifts for birthdays, Christmas, and whenever I find something they'd like.", "It still kind of sounds like your family is racist.  I'm sorry.  You sound like a wonderful person.", "THIS, 10000X THIS!", "But she is your husband\u2019s sister as in the share at least one parent. I don\u2019t think your parents understand what biological means. \n\nAs for being a bad parent, you being a great parent and protecting that little girl. Also tell them what a good example you are by teaching your kids that anyone can be an a hole such as a family member. Tell them your kids don\u2019t need to be exposed by the hate they are showing a literal child.", "family is family, you dont need paper to be family. Glad she has a SIL like you in her life. In my culture its VERY common to have situations like this..and no one bats an eyelid, no one ever says anything, its accepted that the 'adopted' child is part of the family, and treated the same by everyone", "PLEASE keep her away from your parents. They will only exacerbate her fears.", "If that's the case, then I wouldn't send her to sleepaway camps no matter what age she is. You say \"wait till 12\". I'd say, wait forever\n\nAlthough, I've never agreed with the existence of sleep away camps. So I'm a little biased there"]}
