Don't let them guilt you, or make you doubt yourself. You said yourself that she's your daughter, and even if she's not 'technically'. Stand your ground, your kids will remember you being in their corner.  And honestly neither you nor your kids need to be around people who get so caught up on things like blood relations", "NTA.

Children aren't stupid, just inexperienced - she'd figure out real quick what's going on and then your family would have succeeded in making you party to excluding her.  I'm glad you shut this down.\n\nAt its core this is about common decency anyway.  I can't fathom excluding a child like that, it's just mean spirited.  \n\nJust in general - there's a response further down about it being because she's not legally / biologically your child.  So then if there was an adoption they'd feel differently?  If that's the case how very, very petty.", "NTA!  Protect your 10 year old!  She is already getting bounced back and forth.

You're an awesome mom.", "Wow this is so wrong of your family. \n\nSlightly different situation, but I live about 3000 miles from my family and have a step daughter.
