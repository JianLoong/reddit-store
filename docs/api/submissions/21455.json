That would be a line that I wouldn't let someone cross back from personally.", "NTA. As someone who is mixed race but some people can\u2019t tell I can tell you your family is 100% racist because they DO know. You don\u2019t have to be completely obviously mixed/POC to be the victim of racism from family members who know you\u2019re mixed, keep protecting that young girl. \n\nI agree with the people who say to continue staying away, they could easily pretend to let her in but then subtly racially abuse her in ways she\u2019ll feel but you won\u2019t notice or be around for. \n\nKeep being the safe haven she needs", "Ah, here we have the actual root reason your parents are being ugly. They ought to be publicly called out for it. \n\nInfo: do you have relationship with your other relatives?", "Man, I'm so sorry, this had to hurt so much.  As a Mama, I can't imagine having to explain this to my kids. For the record, you're definitely NTA, but mostly this just makes my heart hurt. You're absolutely doing the right thing protecting your kid, but I can't imagine how much this would hurt.", "What would happen if OP had married a man who had kids? Would they treat her stepchildren this way too?", ">This just doesn't make any kind of sense. What if your husband had an adult sister, they wouldn't let her come to Christmas?\n\nI agree too, she would be welcome regardless if she was adult or child. but if she was adult, she would not get a present under the Xmas tree :) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "I don't understand people like this. I grew up in care (mainly with my aunt) and lots of people went down this route of 'not your actual child'. My grandma however, has her daughters' step grandchild visit, has my aunts godchildren visit. I'd take my partners' cousins children I babysit if she was still here now. If you're a child, you get a special batch of your favourite  cake and a present. That's just how it is. \nWe don't even say in laws in our family now. Once you're married you're  all family.", "**And if I were you I wouldn\u2019t visit even after you have legal custody**", "My neighbor across the street is our surrogate grandma. My MIL lives on the opposite corner of the country from us and cannot visit often, FIL is 6 hours away. My parents are deceased. Ms J got a card & grocery store $4 bouquet of flowers from us for mother's day and she cried happy tears. Her relationship with her DIL is difficult to describe it kindly. She loves my kids, and they love her. I grew up with similar neighbors and I still think about Ms Joan often. I learned a lot from her. My kids bring her joy, and a side of grandparent angst because she sees their wild ways from her windows lol.", "Tell them no visit and why in front of the kids, show niece you got her back and make sure the other kids learn that you don\u2019t put up with mistreating others", " **I were you I wouldn\u2019t visit even after you have legal custody**", "Yeah, I think this is a Lilo and Stitch moment. Ohana means family and family means no one gets left behind. NTA and your parents have some thinking to do if they want to see their grandchildren."]}
