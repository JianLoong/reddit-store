I didn\u2019t want it to seem like I was pitying him, so after some small talk, I asked, \u201cso, what are you doing for thanksgiving?!\u201d  He said he was going to heat up some Turkey and gravy with a can of corn.

He didn\u2019t say anything, but I told him he could call friends or family to let them know where he\u2019d be.   He followed me home and we had a really nice evening. We played a few board games and he went home.  Again, I\u2019m not religious, but while he was with us that evening, he said (paraphrasing), \u201cRight after I said no at the deli, a little voice told me I should have said yes.

I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s physically possible, but he said he could feel himself slipping away and he was okay with it. Then, when he met us, it reminded him that there was still more to life. \n\nCharlie was awesome. He taught my girls how to fish with me and told me some crazy war stories. I miss him every day. \n\nAnd now, in our neighborhood group on Facebook, I put out a post every holiday inviting people to dinner if they\u2019re alone, disabled, or just don\u2019t want to cook.
