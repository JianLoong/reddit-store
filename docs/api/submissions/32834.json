He requested to the office desk if he could have an Indian or Asian doctor (FWIW my family is White ). The staff said they would see what they could do.  \nMy sister in law said did you really just say that. And my father said look it up they have to have the best scores to get into medical school. I told my sister in law to just let it go, he has had a tough day. Sister in law grabs my brother and they leave.  \nWhen my father and I get back home, sister in law is FURIOUS and told everyone what happened. However, I thought she would be mad at my dad but instead she is mad at me for enabling and encouraging his racism. She told me that I should be teaching my dad not to be racist, that having preferring Asian and Indian over Black and Hispanic. I am like first of all he prefers them to over White doctors as well so stop lying to people over what he said.   \nI am like would you call a woman that requests a female gynecologist to be sexist?

I told her I don\u2019t care about the race of my doctor but my dad is old just let him do what he wants.  \nIt was all really tense afterwards. Even the kids could sense things weren\u2019t okay.

A woman who practices martial arts and is training for the olympics is going to come in bruised a lot, and she doesn't want the police called every time she does. A gay man has different concerns about sex than a heterosexual man, and no one wants to be judged for their preferences.\n\nIt would be easier to process what someone might be alergic to if you are familiar with their culture's common spices.

Like, A LOT - as proven by surveys within the last decade that say, despite no known actual differences in pain tolerance, 2/3rds of doctors believe that Black women have a higher pain tolerance than white women. I had a fight with a med student just a few weeks ago because he didn't believe that women could feel pain when having an IUD inserted (a widely known incredibly painful procedure) and because he didn't have a cervix that's been hurt before, he didn't believe it had nerve endings (?!?). There's no morality test to get into med school, but there fucking should be. \n\nThere is a direct line - causation, not correlation- for why Black women die FOUR times as often as white women when giving birth. That outcome doesn't change given different economic circumstances - just look at how Serena Williams was treated when she gave birth.", "We should be working to fix that, but that kind of work (to change culture and attitudes) takes time.

Pre-covid, he was on a vent for 5 weeks with maybe 6 consecutive hours breathing unassisted. 6 is being generous. Once the doctors decided that he had a slim chance of getting back to a quality of life my friend would have wanted, the family decided to stop life saving measures. He was doped up, the vent removed, and all nutrition and IVs ceased. It took a little over a week for him to die, and I was by his side for hours every day making sure he wasn't alone. It is the most singularly traumatic experience I've ever had in 30 years on this earth and the fact that he could not have died quickly and at peace but instead either slowly suffocated as his body was unable to continue breathing unaided or starved to death.... if I come to such a choice, I want to go quickly.
