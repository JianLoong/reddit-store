My wife, son and I were all invited and even asked to be in the wedding party. As soon as dates were finalized, we let them know we wouldn't be able to make it. My sister is furious with me, and we have been fighting about this for months, culminating in her calling me a selfish asshole and saying if I don't come she'll never speak to me again.\n\nMy parents want me to come to my sister's wedding very badly and want my son to be ring bearer. They said it's okay if my wife and I don't want to be a bridesmaid and groomsman, but we still have to come. They even said they would do all the child-minding at the ceremony and reception so we can relax more. My mom, especially, is very angry with me for being so stubborn. She said she agrees the date choice is less than ideal, but she says I'm acting like a child about it.\n\nMy wife and I do not want to wake up in a hotel on Christmas Eve. We don't want to spend the night before Christmas Eve driving with an exhausted screaming toddler in the backseat. We don't want to start the holiday already feeling worn-out. We want to be able to prepare for our holiday celebration at home and finish all the little last minute stuff and not be stressed out.\n\nThis is only our son's third Christmas, and the novelty of it hasn't worn off yet. We still do the matching PJs and all the little traditions that we know he will eventually outgrow. Christmas is my wife's favorite holiday. We decorated the hell out of this house, and we have elaborate meals planned on Christmas Eve and Christmas that she is very much looking forward to preparing and I know she doesn't want to start off the hectic two days already tired from a hectic wedding celebration.\n\nI acknowledge my sister's position that this wedding is once in a lifetime and very important, but she chose that day, and that's on her. We want to celebrate Christmas without distractions. That should be our decision. But are we assholes for that decision?", "created_utc": 1669068573, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1bx20/aita_for_prioritizing_something_that_happens/", "score": 347, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She said she agrees the date choice is less than ideal, but she says I'm acting like a child about it.\n\nMy wife and I do not want to wake up in a hotel on Christmas Eve. We don't want to spend the night before Christmas Eve driving with an exhausted screaming toddler in the backseat. We don't want to start the holiday already feeling worn-out. We want to be able to prepare for our holiday celebration at home and finish all the little last minute stuff and not be stressed out.\n\nThis is only our son's third Christmas, and the novelty of it hasn't worn off yet. We still do the matching PJs and all the little traditions that we know he will eventually outgrow. Christmas is my wife's favorite holiday.

Asshat.", "What kind of wife asks her husband to skip his sister's wedding?\n\nI would have gone to my sister in laws wedding even if it was on Christmas day because he loves her and I love him (I also love her, but that's just extra).", "Why your wife can't prioritise your family over her one time?", "Isn\u2019t Christmas about spending time with family? Is your sister and parents not family anymore?", "Your wife sounds horrible to be honest.", "If your wife was any kind of decent wife/human she wouldn\u2019t make you choose. I can\u2019t even begin to imagine asking my husband to choose between my selfish wants and his sister\u2019s once in a lifetime event. I know he would choose me, but the point is I would never put him in that position. His family is now my family as well.", "How do you know that? Have you suggested it? At this point it wouldn't hurt.", "3 hours is nothing and shouldn\u2019t affect Christmas festivities. \n\nWhy not just say it - Whipped as hell and unwilling to step up for your sister. Definitely YTA if you don\u2019t go to wedding.", "You are right.  Thank you.  This is the first time I have ever gotten sucked into one of these. Walking back to my corner.", "It\u2019s a three hour drive. Can you not just drive home after the reception? I doubt your toddler will be screaming for three hours on a car ride after such an action-packed day.", "Toddlers happily wake up at 6am. You could be home by mid morning. You\u2019re being very dramatic about this 3 hours drive.", "I understand wanting to keep with traditions but why not just suck it up this year? Go to the wedding, stay in a hotel that night, drive home in the morning on the 24th, and do all your Chrismas Eve activities when you get home in the late morning/early afternoon? \n\nAn alternative to the included breakfast at the hotel, go to a restaurant that serves a nice breakfast on the way home.\n\nYou would be TA if you end up not going to your sister's wedding just because Christmas Eve is the next day.", "Three hours is not all morning.  Have an extra nice breakfast on the 26th - Boxing Day.  I think you don't want to go to the wedding.  I do believe you will regret this.  I would give anything to spend time with my brother, who died before Christmas.", "Look you clearly don\u2019t want to go to the wedding. You are just using Christmas as a handy excuse. There is no doubt that if you really wanted to attend it you would make it work.  And I suspect were it your wife\u2019s sister she would want to go. Just own it and move on.", "I\u2019ve never seen someone more selfish than you. Although it seems your wife would even outdo you.", "If your wife can\u2019t handle either getting home late on December 23rd or getting home before noon on Christmas Eve so that you can attend your sisters wedding she is a selfish AH.", "So what\u2019s the problem? You made your decision. Just go no contact like planned and move on. You can\u2019t complain about them not liking you after this. Y\u2019all made your choices", "You know what? Christmas is my favorite holiday and very special to me. My husband is an emergency medicine physician and I rarely get to spend an actual Christmas Day with him (this will be our 13th one). I learned very quickly that Christmas can happen when we\u2019re able to be together and that that\u2019s okay. If felt weird for years but I\u2019ve learned to deal with it\u2026because I\u2019m capable of comprehending that the world does not revolve around me. You and your wife are acting like you\u2019re the center of the universe. You have every right to make this decision but be prepared for the damage you\u2019ll cause to your relationships.

Obviously that is your choice, but yes, it does make you and your wife both sound like entitled assholes. Especially considering all of the accommodations that your parents are seemingly willing to offer you in order for you and your wife to simply attend. It's not even like you won't be able to still do the traditions that you wish, you just might be a bit tired. Who isn't tired by Christmas? Stop being so damned entitled.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMassive, massive YTA", "If you go forward with this, I hope she is the ONLY important person to you because your family will disown you and they would not be wrong in doing so.\n\nNAH but when your family cuts you off, you don't get to be mad at them about it because it is your choice that will lead to it happening.", "Does your wife realize that the event celebrated at Christmas really took place in summertime?  The early church moved it to coincidence with a pagean holiday - so basically its a made up date that can (& does) get celebrated on different dates since 12/25 doesnt always work for everyone.  Its not the date, but the gathering of family/loved ones that actually matter", "Your wife seems kinda fragile tbh", "Your wife sounds about as mature as your toddler. Is she going to throw a tantrum or be too cranky for Santa because she has to go to a wedding two days before Christmas?", "But she could have this exact same holiday on the 26th. It's not like it has to be on the full moon or something.", "You know you\u2019re an adult with agency, right? And that it\u2019s legal to celebrate Christmas even after the 25th? I promise you won\u2019t get in trouble with Santa if you postpone.", "What are you on? There wasn't a question at all and you are trying to create an argument with OP not the other way round.", "That wasn't a question? They said my wife is getting coal, and I added the information that her stocking will be too full of some absolutely badass goodies. What's the question?", "Also the wedding isn\u2019t even on Christmas.  He can still have his happy Christmas.  He just doesn\u2019t want to be inconvenienced.  That really puts it over the edge for me.  The post isn\u2019t wedding vs Christmas.  It\u2019s wedding and a tiresome Christmas or Christmas exactly how we want.", "It matters to my wife.", "The wild part here is no one is even asking them to skip the holiday.. just attend an event on a Friday night in December.", "Am I supposed to understand this chemistry analogy you've created?", "Bruss it's not that big a deal", "Sister is the AH here for choosing that date and I'll die on that hill.", "A controlling one!  We see who wears the pants in the house!  YTA!", "Why should she?", "She's an incredible wife. The food she makes is divine. She's fun and adventurous. She's an amazing mom. She's a truly incredible person.", "They want us there for the wedding and reception.

I'm whipped.", "Celebrate Orthodox Christmas for a year!", "You're arguing with literally everyone that doesn't have your point of view. It's annoying. You've made up your mind, ergo, you didn't come here looking for judgment whether you're TA. You came here looking for confirmation and to argue when you didn't get it. YTA", "Then have fun being cut off by your sister because of your pettiness", "No, that's just a way for me to revise for my exam. But now you understand it tho. You're welcome bro <3, happy to help.", "It is for me. If OP knew the pain of losing a sister he'd understand me too. He'd understand the countless nights I spend thinking about all the time I should've spent with her, the times I drank my grief away and eased the pain with drugs.

We don\u2019t want you to grow up with close familial bonds where you exhibit compassion, love, and support one another\u2026we want you to learn to be self centered and prioritize yourself!\u201d\n\nYou do realize this is the type of message this behavior sends to your children?", "Because she's not an asshole? \n\nLike the *minimum* requirement for not being an asshole is to occasionally make compromises or small sacrifices for the benefit of people you care about.", "It's a one time family event. If this event is important for you, I think she definitely be an asshole if she don't consider this event over Christmas. But you seem to don't care about your sister.", "Who wants to isolate you from your family. Or are you really so selfish that you can\u2019t spend a few hours in the car with your son on Christmas Eve? \n\nYTA. There\u2019s reasonable compromises and you haven\u2019t tried a single one. You sound like you\u2019re itching to cut your family out, so I have to ask, what\u2019s the normal family dynamic? Are you the golden child?", "Offer the ceremony as a compromise. Better than nothing and they get all the family photos.", "Does your wife care about your relationship with your family enough to make this compromise this one year that btw your child won\u2019t even remember? I mean if it\u2019s so important to them for you to be there then this all should have been brought up with you before firm plans were made on the wedding imho so there\u2019s that but I don\u2019t see why you can\u2019t say to your family now that \u201cyou either get us for the ceremony or not at all\u201d at least? Btw this comes from someone who tries to avoid all family events haha.\n\nEdit to add judgement of NTA. Nobody is entitled to people attending their wedding especially around holidays or destination weddings (I had a destination wedding and wasn\u2019t upset when people couldn\u2019t attend) but also 3 hours isn\u2019t a terrible drive to me personally since that\u2019s how far my husband and I have to drive (6 hours total) to visit our families around the holidays and I would worry about feeling regret when it was doable and skipping it.", "Not at all. Whipped is how I would describe someone who is inflexible and unwilling to attend a once in a lifetime event for a family member due to irrational spousal influence.", "I'm not arguing. I asked if I was an asshole, not what my wife should get for Christmas, lol.", "That's her choice.", "But you didn't help me.", "I think op will be ok. Are you projecting your own issues onto op?", "_You_ can fill the stockings with diamonds and ps5s if you want, but I think JeepersCreepers was suggesting that your wife (and more likely both of you) will be on _Santa's_ naughty list, regardless.", "you are arguing, you are NOT accepting that people think yta, and being an overall a in the comments"]}
