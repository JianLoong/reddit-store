God forbid your dad gets drunk at the wedding or the reception then all you will remember is that moment.  We invited my father in law to our wedding. He showed up dressed like he was going fishing to our formal hindu wedding and showed up an hour late for our Christian ceramony ( we didn't wait for him, he was only in formal pictures). My husband was pissed and it soured the day for him. \n\nI would suggest meeting your dad for coffee and explaining your fears, concerns and why this decision is the right one. I would even say \"dad I don't want my husband's family judging you if something happens\"", "NTA, you are never wrong for not letting things go from the past. These people want to be trauma gatekeepers, if they decide you should let it go, then you should. Who the hell do they think they are?? Nahh these people sounds toxic and your parents as well.\n\nYou removed your father and everything was blissfull, doesnt that say enough to go NC for the rest of your life? Your mom sucks as well and is a big enabler, she doesnt do consequences except when it comes to you. Choose yourself OP and F these immature people", "NTA. Weddings should never be about healing toxic relationships.", "NTA \ud83d\udcaf\n\nIT'S **YOUR** WEDDING!!!", "NTA your mother was wrong for insisting you invite your father - why do people think it's a good idea to repair a longstanding, toxic relationship on a very public day? If your father wanted to fix things he would have started well before now, things don't magically go away. I think you should uninvite your father, let your mother know her bad decisions with men are not yours and enjoy your day. You deserve to have a wonderful wedding without all this drama. And I'm curious- are your parents still married?", "NTA! Your wedding is a day for your and your spouse. NOT for propping up some lie about what a picture perfect family you come from.  Politely tell those that are giving you a hard time about your dad to pound sand. That you have made a final decision and if the persist hang up or leave the discussion.  Congratulations on your wedding.", "Sounds like daddy dear is on a bender again so there is no talking to him before he gets to the other side", "NTA nobody gets to dictate what you do on your wedding day.", "Call his bluff.  Agree that he's uninvited.  Tell them what he did, and consider uninviting any more that cause problems over it!\n\nYou don't owe him anything for him being a person who had sex 22 years ago.", "NTA, make sure that on the day of the wedding, whoever is manning the doors know that your father is not invited and not to be let in. I wouldn't put it past him to show up uninvited.", "NTA: and hire security for your wedding so that if your dad comes and causes a scene he can be SWIFTLY removed.", "YTA. For even considering his attendance after such display of contempt for you.", "NTA. Go NC with him. He will only bring your headaches and heartbreaks.", "NTA", "NTA It's not the past if he keeps repeating the same behavior. It's better that he is not invited, otherwise he would probably just make another scene.", "The ones who are saying you are wrong for holding on to the past were probably not there in your past to know how bad it was.  Don't listen to those people.  Only listen to your heart.  Do what's best for your peace of mind.  NTA.  Your dad & the people siding with him are all AH's.  And the fact that your mom is defending your dad is not ok.  Mom was there, she knows the hurt he caused, she should have your back."]}
