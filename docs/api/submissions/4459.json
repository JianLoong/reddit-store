{"id": 4459, "submission_id": "ziq7ba", "title": "AITA for telling my mom that my stepdad won\u2019t be considered grandpa to my kids", "selftext": "Throwaway, for privacy. \nMy parents got divorced when I was young, and my mother rekindled an old relationship with her childhood friend when I was 8, we\u2019ll call him Micheal for this story. I\u2019ve never thought of him as an extra parent, just a pleasant man that makes my mom happy. However he\u2019s technically been my stepfather for 20 years. I\u2019m 28 F and pregnant with me and my husbands first child. \n\nMy mom is over the moon with excitement about her first grandchild, and is all over my pregnancy. While she generally respects all the boundaries and \u201crules\u201d my husband and I are setting it\u2019s clear she has some expectations as well. Recently the conversation of grandparent-names came up. My mom stated that we needed to find another word for grandpa for Micheal, since my own father would be primary grandpa. I looked at her a bit confused, and told her that her husband wasn\u2019t going to be my child\u2019s grandfather. \n\nI explained that while I find Micheal to be a really enjoyable person, he does not hold a parental role in my life and therefore won\u2019t with my kids. They will be allowed to babysit, and I am somewhat safe with him being around my child, but that is it. Micheal isn\u2019t going to be babysitting our child alone, and his relationship with our child will be through my mom. My mom stated that I needed to use him as more than that, and as her husband he had the right to be grandpa to my kids. \n\nI tried explaining to my mom that if they split up, or if she was to pass, I probably wouldn\u2019t stay in contact with Micheal. That simply isn\u2019t the nature of my relationship to him. Micheal has never tried to force the parental role, but I know he always wished I would have let him in more. \n\nMy mom is flipping out calling me cruel, selfish, and saying I\u2019m robbing my children of love. Micheal hasn\u2019t really said anything but I know he\u2019s a bit disappointed. I have told my mom, that Micheal is more than welcome in my child\u2019s life he just isn\u2019t going to be \u201cgrandpa\u201d. My father is currently single, but if he were to marry someone they also wouldn\u2019t automatically become \u201cgrandma\u201d. However my mom won\u2019t listen and continue to curse me out for this choice. My husband is fully supporting me, but my moms words are starting to get to me. So, AITA?\n\nEDIT: because I\u2019ve already seen this being brought up. I have a complicated relationship to my mother. She is a hard woman to be close to, which is also reflected in her relationship with Micheal. They aren\u2019t the most stable people and their access to our child wont be unlimited.\n\nEDIT 2: As many of you have pointed out, it\u2019s not really about the name. I wouldn\u2019t stop my child from calling him something else, but I\u2019m realizing now I don\u2019t care about the name Micheal is called, I care about their relationship. I don\u2019t fully trust my mother nor Micheal, and I\u2019ll be looking into alternative ways they might both have a relationship with my child.\n\nEDIT 3: Many people ask what my issue with my mother and Micheal is. They had major relationship issues for the first 10 years of their relationship, where they\u2019d break up a couple times a month in dramatic ways. My mother was also abusive to me as a child, and because Micheal wasn\u2019t a parental figure, he just passively watched. I\u2019m realizing my issue isn\u2019t with the name Micheal is called, it\u2019s with their access to my child.", "created_utc": 1670762015, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ziq7ba/aita_for_telling_my_mom_that_my_stepdad_wont_be/", "score": 622, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like, I don't know if you have any siblings, but say if you had a sister and she got married, her spouse would be your child's uncle, right? Why is it different with parents? People enter a family through marriages and it's a sign of respect to not then go around and have each one of them prove to you that their relationship is stable and that they're good with your kid and this and that before you honor them with the title of aunt/uncle or whatever. I don't know. I have had aunts and uncles through marriage who were more quiet and reserved or who were real assholes, but who I still considered aunts and uncles. Idk if this is a cultural thing or something? And it's definitely weirder with a parent than it is with other family remarrying. But gatekeeping the term just feels a bit weird. Gatekeeping what sort of relationship they have, absolutely valid with any family members, blood related or not. But gatekeeping the term \"grandpa\"?

I have so many \u201cuncles\u201d in my family that were friends to my parents because they were around so much. I couldn\u2019t simply call them by their real names. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that they\u2019re not related to me. As well, I have a grandmother who is not my grandmother, but has been in my life as long as all the other \u201creal \u201cgrandparents have been and I love her as much. The name or the relationship to you does not matter if your child loves them and wants to be around them. You don\u2019t have the right to control the way that they see them. At the end of the day when they see old people who they call their grandparents, they are going to wonder why the \u201cother\u201d person is not called something similar. In actuality, you are making the issue more complex by not allowing him to be called something because your child will inherently wonder why. Kids are very intuitive. Don\u2019t cause an issue where there is none. I understand, your relationship with them was not well, but your child\u2019s relationship with them could very well be what changes your opinion of them. Give them that chance or don\u2019t, but don\u2019t be surprised when your kid inherently brings up demons through questioning what just doesn\u2019t make sense.

That last sentence is important.", "You don\u2019t have to have a title to have a relationship. He could be an uncle or grandma\u2019s friend or an acquaintance and still have a relationship with the child.", "yeah, her first post was pretty vague but the updates really help explain her perspective on why she doesn\u2019t want Michael and her mother to have a certain type of relationship with the baby", "That doesn't mean anything.", "None of those things mean he is a father to her.", "No, he actually didn\u2019t. They didn\u2019t move in together before I was in my teens, because they didn\u2019t want to impose him in my life. He was around, but he was never a parent, and he never directly tried to be.", "A step parent who actually wants a relationship with their step child on that child's terms is pretty damn rare to begin with. Plenty of people seem to marry single parents either with the intention of becoming the child's new parent (no matter how the kid feels) or without caring at all for the kids - or occasionally, like my (now ex)step father, because they want to abuse the kids. Few are willing to nurture a relationship on their step kid's timeline and without pushing boundaries. That's basically the only way to be a step parent without being an asshole.", "We have multiple other babysitting arrangements set up. Their time with baby won't be for our benefit. We are not using them as free babysitters, we're exploring if they're gonna be a positive influence in our child's life.", "This has been pointed out to be repeatedly. I also don\u2019t fully trust my mom, and you\u2019re right I maybe wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable leaving my child with them without supervision. As another redditor suggested, we might need to consider LC/NC. At least until our child is old enough to communicate with us fully.", "See my updates please", "She's ok with her child having a relationship with the abuser but not the bystander?", "But then she also says he's a nice guy.... I'm confused", "yeah, she left out a lot originally but the updates really help explain her perspective more", "what", "I mean, did you see the edit? She stated that he never stepped up to help her when her mother was abusive. I wouldn't really want a relationship with someone like this too, I just don't really understand why she still contacts them so for me is ESH", "Op was abused as child and her mother's husband didn't do anything to stop it. It's that kind of thing you push in the back of your mind until it explodes. For me OP wouldn't let any of them have access to her child.", "I wanted to add that it works for us, I consider them my full blooded sisters and not my half sisters! They just have a different mother", "No, I'm saying that given what we know about him, that he was pretty shit as a step father. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day, so he probably did some things that weren't awful - he didn't rape her and torture her like my step father did to me, for instance.", "Grandma's friend? They've been married for 20 years. That's disrespectful to be honest. The mom already started the conversation by saying OP's dad would be the primary grandpa and she just wanted to know what her husband's nickname should be. It sounds like they were already in agreement about her husband's role and OP just dug the knife in for no reason.", "Sure. But OP is specifically denying him a title when having one makes a lot of sense. Does her mom need to earn the grandma title before she's allowed to use it? Michael has been married to grandma for 20 years and will be acting as a grandpa as soon as this baby is born. OP is going out if her way to hinder the relationship before it even has a chance to start.", "My step mum is my daughters grandmother, it does mean something. Blood doesn\u2019t automatically make family.", "It sounds like he was a nice man who really cares about how you felt about things. You just seem spiteful. You don't want your child to have an extra person who loves them? That's super weird.", "So it sounds like he respected your boundaries because he knew you already had a dad and he couldn\u2019t replace him?\nYta. Call him Pappy or something.", "[deleted]", "I don't think there's anything wrong with not wanting a relationship with your step kid tbh. Kids aren't owed anything by anyone except their parents. And different couples have different agreements regarding children. Some may agree that the step parent has no responsibilities or duties towards the kid and as long as both parties in the couple agree then that's that. My own relationship with my step dad was like that where neither of us cared much for the other but accepted the other because of my mum, it took maybe 6 years for us to consider each other family.\n\nWhat bothers me the most is when people reject step parents that want a relationship with them so the step parents back off and then they're upset the step parent doesn't want a relationship with them anymore", ">they're gonna be a positive influence in our child's life.\n\nQuit while you're ahead. You are doing this to deliberately hurt your mother and her husband, your step-father. You are the asshole.", "That's even more YTA", "Sounds like she's thinking of going no contact with both.", "She said he was pleasant and makes her (abusive) mother happy, and that she finds him to be an enjoyable person she does have any relationship with.", "go read her updates - the mother was abusive and Michael did nothing to stop it, so why does he deserve some sort of rights to this child?", "She probably have been trying to relink her relationship with her mother. But in this instance once again the mother was abusive towards her. Denial is a powerful tool specially when you wanted to have a normal relationship with your mother.", "Yes because him being a \"pleasant and enjoyable person who is allowed to be around the child screams he is a horrible human. What happened to you and this person is nothing alike", "My fam used to call my gay uncles bf his \u201cfriend\u201d.  It\u2019s so disrespectful", "I was giving examples of how title does not affect the relationship. But a nickname would suit if she wants, but I see where she is coming from.", "I understand but it\u2019s her choice.", "And neither does marriage. Not everyone is blessed.", "My parents had shared custody and I spend the majority of my teen years at my actual fathers house. He genuinely only has the role of my mothers partner in my life.", "I think it's a dick move to marry a single parent without having a good and healthy relationship with their kids.\n\nSee what bothers me is when step parents get so butthurt that their step child doesn't immediately warm up to them that they completely shut down and stop trying to have a relationship at all with the kid.", "But a lack of title and a concerted effort to make sure the kid knows Michael does *not* have a title is sure to affect the relationship. I don't know how saying he's not a real grandpa doesn't affect the relationship.", "Agreed. But a bad choice. She's projecting her own shit onto a child who won't understand and complicating things for no reason while insulting both Michael and her mother. She's free to do that but it doesn't absolve her of the consequences of that choice.", "It usually is a choice whether or not to be an asshole.", "Yeah and that petty choice can make her an AH.", "Ok so then, what's the han on letting him have a nickname,? Honestly, you're just taking away what could be a loving, safe person for your kids. I have a step mom that was NEVER a mom to me, and my kids have a name for her, and they are the only grandkids she'll ever have. I didn't (don't) have a wonderful relationship with her either, but seeing her love on my kids greatly improved it. You can at least let him close a nickname and see what happens before automatically cutting him off.", "He will know Michael but just won\u2019t have a grandpa title.", "100% agree with you. My hubby's step-dad is Poppa to our kids even though he married my hubby's mum after he had moved out at 19. Never a parent role. But wow he is a great Poppa. So much fun, and a wonderful person for the kids. He never had kids of his own, so no biological grandkids, but he comes to every event, offers to babysit, plays like a big goofy kid himself. The kids love him, and he loves them."]}
