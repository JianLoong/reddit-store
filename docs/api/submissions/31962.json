Your husband rightly feels betrayed by that.\n\nGrandma's secret fund was a thing people did when women didn't have options. At this point, being the bigger earner, you are simply hiding things from your husband.", "YTA, good for you having the fund, you can finally use it for the divorce AND give him half plus alimony. He has such a horrible partner in you.", "NTA - Every one needs a \"Grammy\u2019s Secret Fund\" I always called it an FU fund. Boss wants you to sleep with him FU, partner gets violent FU. etc. \n\nThe fact that he blew his gasket means you both need to calm down and talk about this. Frankly I am worried that now that the fund is known about it will be drained for non emergencies. That trip thats just a bit to expensive, that car thats just a bit out of the price range the remodel that you only kinda wanted.", "Incredibly easy YTA.", "NAH - is you having a secret account being paranoid, very likely, but at the same time you've seen first hand that you never really need it untill you absolutely do need it, so I can't blame you for that.\n\nYour husband is understandably feeling very betrayed by what you've done. I think any person in his position would feel the same considering you've been together 15 years and it seems like you don't trust him because you have a secret fund.\n\nFrankly I think you both need to sit down and have a conversation about this like adults. Tell him your side, the history with your Grammy and your mum.", "NTA. It was the money you earned and you can do whatever you want with that money. Having a Grammy secret fund is very sensible.", "YTA for hiding money from your husband.\nYou yourself even referred to it as a \u201csecret\u201d fund.\nSecrets are lies of omission and have no place in a loving marriage.\nYour friend is a moron if she didn\u2019t insist the accounts be joint and access to credit in her own name.\nIt\u2019s wonderful that you want to help her, but you should have discussed it with your husband.", "Yeah.\r  \nThat was secret\r  \nIt should have been between you and your friend.\r  \nLike a loan for later.", "YTA \nCan\u2019t trust your husband.", "YTA\n\nI get why you did it, but it came at the cost of compromising the trust in your relationship.\n\nHim learning this about you will make him question everything else he feels he already knows or doesn\u2019t know about you.\n\nYou\u2019d feel the same way if he had a secret fund you knew nothing about and was giving away to his friends", "I think NAH\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong by keeping this money just in case. If everyone could predict when a partner was going to turn out to be abusive later there wouldn't be a problem with domestic violence, so keeping an emergency fund is not a bad idea.\n\nHowever I also can't really blame your husband for being upset. I'm confused why you kept the money secret but then told him so readily where it came from when you helped your friend out. If you felt it no longer needed to be separate you could have had that conversation with your husband as a better time\n\nThis just seems like poor communication more than anything else", "How could you transfer it to her account if she didn't have her name on any?", "YTA.

I think you're being a little na\u00efve not to have expected some blowback about your choices.\n\nHe feels betrayed because you didn't trust him and he feels that he would have done some things differently had he known the truth. To back it up, you've made a major financial decision without consulting him in any way, so, once again he feels that he's unimportant. \n\nI should make it clear that I think you're perfectly entitled to help your lifelong friend, what's money for if not to help those whom you love? I like the fact that you've told her not to worry about re-paying it either. That makes it a true gift and takes the stress away from [her.at](http://her.at) a time when stress had become a mountain for her. It's your money, and your choice. But if I was married to you, while I would have supported your decision and your right to make it, I would have been very pissed off about the lack of trust and the deceit. \n\nI think you need to take some time to explain why you've behaved as you have and to acknowledge his hurt feelings. This is a man who's loved and trusted you for most of his adult life - finding out that you've misled him over a fundamental part of the relationship may well have hit him similarly to finding you in bed with someone else. \n\nYTA", "Depends on your marriage.

Weird but true, she told me at one point she wanted a secret fund for her own, when we were having huge troubles in our marriage, and i agreed. We have absolutely zero secrets and every decision over let's say $ 200 is a joint decision.\n\nSo, yes, in my eyes you are very majorly TA. I'd call this a major breach of trust, hiding those funds.

YTA. I get where you\u2019re coming from with the \u201cgranny fund\u201d. My mother also advised for it. I disagreed. I chose to marry and trust my wife. You broke his trust.

Between your grandmother, mother, and now best friend. For you, every instance of the ending of a relationship was justification of having a hidden account. You then have to ask yourself, do you trust your partner at all? If you trusted him, telling him about the account doesn\u2019t give him the money. If your name is the only name on the account, then you\u2019re the only person with access to the money. \n\nAlso, changing times between Grammy and 2023. My grandmother was born in 1924 in backwoods Mississippi, and her desire for my mom was to have a career. She never wanted it to happen but if my mom\u2019s spouse died or left, she wanted my mom to be able to support herself. I believe that was Grammy\u2019s thinking.

How you did it is seriously crappy IMO. \n\nYTA.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m not 100% being overly critical about the trust issues. I trust only two people on this earth.

And not because you need it, but because you don't trust your husband.", "YTA basically for 15 years you've had one foot out the door and literally banking on your marriage to fail while all this time your husband has been all in I really feel bad for your husband because of the level of distrust that you have shown", "NTA. The point of having a secret fund is that it's secret.  Plus, it's yours.", "I understand the reason why you had a secret account. First husband screwed me over like your friend's husband. That being said, your secret money should have stayed a secret or not been one to begin with. You telling him this news after so many years is similar to someone who got away with cheating, ended the cheating relationship and sometime later, to feel better, tells their spouse. You lied to your husband for several years, trust broken. Your lie may have likely affected financial decisions made within the marriage for the entire marriage. You excluded your husband from at least one major financial decision. Had you, from the beginning agreed to a shared together account for the household and separate personal accounts your husband wouldn't have a reason to have strong feelings ie hurt, betrayed, uncertain of your comment, angry etc. \nWhile he would have needed to have someone to talk with after your revelations everyone shouldn't be involved.

You did what your mother had done that kept her afloat when her marriage crumbled. It gave you security that you probably felt you needed from your childhood trauma and coaching on how that trauma should be dealt with. \n\nYes it was a secret you kept but you say you never went through financial hardship. In the end, your friend isn\u2019t on the street and I have seen far too many women screwed over by men to think that isn\u2019t the most important thing.", "NTA\n\nTrust is important in a marriage, sure, but the reality is that sometimes, it's better to be safe rather than sorry, and that it doesn't matter how much trust you have in your spouse, everyone should have some sort of personal emergency fund. \n\nDV is a huge issue in most societies, so being prepared for the worst is essential. It's basically a form of insurance. You're a good friend OP.", "NTA it\u2019s your money.", "YTA\nIt\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Because all you\u2019ve done by hiding money is saying \u201cI have no faith in you and in this marriage\u201d.  \n\nThe thing is, you could have just told him about this account but not have his name on it and he has 0 access to it. You both could have set up backup accounts \u201cjust in case\u201d where you both agree to some set amount and the rest goes into the joint account.

Accept a job you had rather not because you needed the money or send your kid to something lesser than youd want because the alternative was too dear? \n\nNow in an equal relationship that fine. You both sacrifice and live with it. You however kept a different calculator and shared only in part leaving him to pick up the difference.

If your husband is upset simply because you helped someone with your own funds, that would be unreasonable.

She's floored - only the luckiest people on the planet have cars gifted to them. The abuser even sets it up so her favorite song is playing when she sits in the driver's seat for the first time, and she's overwhelmed with joy. So romantic!

Obviously, open communication is what a relationship should strive for. \n\nBut given the amount of DV specifically against women, how hard it can be for them to escape those situations, I do not blame OP for keeping it a secret or think she should have to share that info. \n\nThe way DV survivors who don't have a fund like this escape is by NOT letting their abuser know. Not even giving the slightest indication that they're planning their exit. They use hidden burner phones, they try to save up enough cash and hide it away. And that's hard if you have no financial access or aren't allowed to work. The abuse escalates if the abuser finds these things. \n\nHonestly, having this precautious backup account would make it significantly easier. OP could up and leave immediately if she needed to, instead of biding her time with her abuser and hoping it doesn't escalate. \n\nThe husband can feel betrayed, but instead of being hurt at the thought that she'd ever think he'd abuse her, he said it was money they could've used essentially with the \"i wouldn't have stressed so much if I knew you had this money\" line. I think that's what leaves a sour taste in my mouth about it. And then telling his family, what else was that going to do other than get them to harass her over it?", "BS. You\u2019re talking about cases with rational adults. If you have a DV instance, it really wouldn\u2019t be hard to force the victim to sign over the money or power to control the account. \n\nHonestly, it was great advice from the grandmother that helped her mother and now her friend.", "Uhhhhh if they end up abusive and know about it, you might as well not have it.", "Right. It\u2019s not even that complicated to set up. My wife and I have a joint bank account and our own bank accounts.

That's where those secret accounts are for, for escaping abusive assholes.", "When a person becomes abusive they will steal your identity papers, cards, get the passwords to your accounts and change them.

This is for men and women. Women can go and drain a joint account, just as easily as a man.\n\nI agree, she shouldn't have kept the fact that she has a safety account secret from her husband. But I think they should both have safety accounts with sole access.\n\nIn the event of a divorce, yes those accounts are declared too. But there could be months or years of living expenses & lawyers fees until that point. Not to mention, like I said, escaping a dangerous situation.\n\n**Edit:** PSA: if your partner/spouse is the only one named on critical accounts, please please think about the fact that you would not be able to access those accounts in the event that they die or become incapacitated in some way. And if you're not married, you wouldn't even have a right to what's in the accounts. You could lose everything. It's not just about breaking up or someone becoming abusive.", ">So everyone should have a secret bank account just in case their marriage doesn't work out?\n\nTo be fair, if this was a common and widely accepted practice, then people would just assume everyone has such account, and there would be no blowback from \"discovering\" it.\n\nI would absolutely love if it was the case, but I'm a big opponent of merging everything during marriage in general.

Victims come in all kinds. Abusers aren\u2019t as easy to spot as we\u2019d like them to be and they don\u2019t reveal themselves  conveniently. They are deceptive and manipulative people.

He came from China, his eyes bright and full of hope, thinking Canada would be the Land of Milk and Honey, as they say. As he lived here over the 20 years (I met him in his first year of living in Canada.), he became disenchanted with Canada and turned towards communist China. He idol worships their president, Xi Jin-Ping.

Both of us earn money and we are comfortable financially\" I would see no problem with that either. Financial autonomy is important and healthy.\n\n\"Isolated from their support network\" is a huge fkn stretch.
