At this point, being the bigger earner, you are simply hiding things from your husband.", "YTA, good for you having the fund, you can finally use it for the divorce AND give him half plus alimony. He has such a horrible partner in you.", "NTA - Every one needs a \"Grammy\u2019s Secret Fund\" I always called it an FU fund. Boss wants you to sleep with him FU, partner gets violent FU. etc. \n\nThe fact that he blew his gasket means you both need to calm down and talk about this. Frankly I am worried that now that the fund is known about it will be drained for non emergencies. That trip thats just a bit to expensive, that car thats just a bit out of the price range the remodel that you only kinda wanted.", "Incredibly easy YTA.", "NAH - is you having a secret account being paranoid, very likely, but at the same time you've seen first hand that you never really need it untill you absolutely do need it, so I can't blame you for that.\n\nYour husband is understandably feeling very betrayed by what you've done. I think any person in his position would feel the same considering you've been together 15 years and it seems like you don't trust him because you have a secret fund.\n\nFrankly I think you both need to sit down and have a conversation about this like adults. Tell him your side, the history with your Grammy and your mum.", "NTA. It was the money you earned and you can do whatever you want with that money.

If everyone could predict when a partner was going to turn out to be abusive later there wouldn't be a problem with domestic violence, so keeping an emergency fund is not a bad idea.\n\nHowever I also can't really blame your husband for being upset. I'm confused why you kept the money secret but then told him so readily where it came from when you helped your friend out.

I think you're being a little na\u00efve not to have expected some blowback about your choices.\n\nHe feels betrayed because you didn't trust him and he feels that he would have done some things differently had he known the truth. To back it up, you've made a major financial decision without consulting him in any way, so, once again he feels that he's unimportant. \n\nI should make it clear that I think you're perfectly entitled to help your lifelong friend, what's money for if not to help those whom you love? I like the fact that you've told her not to worry about re-paying it either. That makes it a true gift and takes the stress away from [her.at](http://her.at) a time when stress had become a mountain for her. It's your money, and your choice. But if I was married to you, while I would have supported your decision and your right to make it, I would have been very pissed off about the lack of trust and the deceit. \n\nI think you need to take some time to explain why you've behaved as you have and to acknowledge his hurt feelings. This is a man who's loved and trusted you for most of his adult life - finding out that you've misled him over a fundamental part of the relationship may well have hit him similarly to finding you in bed with someone else. \n\nYTA", "Depends on your marriage.

YTA. I get where you\u2019re coming from with the \u201cgranny fund\u201d. My mother also advised for it. I disagreed. I chose to marry and trust my wife. You broke his trust.

Between your grandmother, mother, and now best friend. For you, every instance of the ending of a relationship was justification of having a hidden account. You then have to ask yourself, do you trust your partner at all? If you trusted him, telling him about the account doesn\u2019t give him the money. If your name is the only name on the account, then you\u2019re the only person with access to the money. \n\nAlso, changing times between Grammy and 2023. My grandmother was born in 1924 in backwoods Mississippi, and her desire for my mom was to have a career.

The point of having a secret fund is that it's secret.  Plus, it's yours.", "I understand the reason why you had a secret account. First husband screwed me over like your friend's husband. That being said, your secret money should have stayed a secret or not been one to begin with. You telling him this news after so many years is similar to someone who got away with cheating, ended the cheating relationship and sometime later, to feel better, tells their spouse. You lied to your husband for several years, trust broken. Your lie may have likely affected financial decisions made within the marriage for the entire marriage. You excluded your husband from at least one major financial decision. Had you, from the beginning agreed to a shared together account for the household and separate personal accounts your husband wouldn't have a reason to have strong feelings ie hurt, betrayed, uncertain of your comment, angry etc. \nWhile he would have needed to have someone to talk with after your revelations everyone shouldn't be involved.

In the end, your friend isn\u2019t on the street and I have seen far too many women screwed over by men to think that isn\u2019t the most important thing.", "NTA\n\nTrust is important in a marriage, sure, but the reality is that sometimes, it's better to be safe rather than sorry, and that it doesn't matter how much trust you have in your spouse, everyone should have some sort of personal emergency fund. \n\nDV is a huge issue in most societies, so being prepared for the worst is essential. It's basically a form of insurance. You're a good friend OP.", "NTA it\u2019s your money.", "YTA\nIt\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy. The fund is a decent idea but I don\u2019t see why you couldn\u2019t tell him and made it an absolute need if you feel strongly about it.", "YTA for having a secret account. It's a betrayal of trust. I think if you explained the family reason for why you learned to always have a separate account \"just in case\" he'd understand. \n\nMy partner and I have been together over a decade and we don't have any joint bank accounts. We operate on a \"we love and trust each other and we are together because we love each other and there is nothing that forces us to stay together such as finances or a house etc\". \n\nI don't care what my partner spends her money on.

You both could have set up backup accounts \u201cjust in case\u201d where you both agree to some set amount and the rest goes into the joint account.

How can you be surprised your husband is upset?", "NTA \n\n1. You are paying your part of the bills and retirement. \n\n2. One should always have a fund for a rainy day. My dad had one that my mother didn\u2019t know about when the recession hit. It got us through without losing our home. That fund is not for him. All spouses should have their own money.", "^^^ 100% this. I know it\u2019s unpopular, but as a woman I have to agree. A secret fund and zero financial communication? I\u2019d hit the roof, too, if my husband pulled this on me.\n\nSorry OP, I get your heart was in the right place for your friend, but good lord, your marital communication needs work. \n\nOne of my friends literally just divorced her husband because he went out and bought a 40k truck without consulting her first. Big expenditures like that absolutely need to be run by your partner. \n\nThe problem isn\u2019t that you had a separate account, separate funds, or that you wanted to give your friend a helping hand\u2014it\u2019s the fact you didn\u2019t tell him about either of those things beforehand and then casually revealed it to him mid conversation like it was no big deal. Dropping an anvil on his head would\u2019ve been kinder.", "Clearly the concept of \u2018Grandmas Secret Fund\u2019 is still a useful one. If the best friend had had one then OP wouldn\u2019t have had to loan her the money.", "Hell, she could still have the fund. Just let him know about it. This isn't some money stashed into a mattress he could steal. Have a separate bank account he doesn't have access to. It's the same concept, just you know, don't hide $15k from your husband??", "I'll add another unpopular opinion. She said that the friend's husband was wonderful at the beggining but he also convinced her to put his name only everywhere. How does that make sense? Maybe he wasn't so wonderful after all?\nAlso, you can have bank account on your name WITHOUT hiding it. Me and my husband have separate bank accounts but we know exactly how much money the other person has. \nI also think that having a marriage based on lies and doing things behind your partner's back is not worth it. If you are scared simply stay single. YTA", "I swear reddit loves siding with women in these situations. But reverse the roles and a man would be a giant ah if he was hiding money and giving it away without even speaking to his wife. \n\nWhat really ticks me off is how OP's husband has done absolutely nothing to warrant this secret fund.", "Trying to find a different pov here, i genuinely don\u2019t think she\u2019s TA for not telling him. Assuming that she\u2019s the one that worked for it, why does he care about what she spends/ saves it on if it doesn\u2019t involve infidelity?", "Just because that was the right decision for you doesn't mean it's the right thing to do. Depending where you are there might be very little support for someone leaving an abusive relationship and although it would be jarring for a partner to discover, having some money separate is a smart backup plan to have for a lot of people\n\nAlso sounds like she's been saving it since we'll before then I don't think that counts as shared assets", "How is getting someone elses opinion abuse again?  When that is exactly what OP is doing on Reddit.? Explain please.", "If you are married isn\u2019t all money shared finances?", "She said she put more money into their retirement and pays most of the bills since she makes more. So\nI\u2019m assuming it\u2019s not affecting him when it doesn\u2019t affect them finacially", "I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have no problems maintaining a healthy relationship lol.", "lol !!!!!!! Clearly you don't understand what it means when you marry someone. Whether you like it or not, marriage is a financial partnership. Spending FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS without speaking to your spouse is 100% against the rules.", "That\u2019s where you are wrong.  Any money made during the marriage is marital property.", "Entitled? They are married, when I think of marriage I think I wouldn't plan an escape unless I needed to, so she is either incompetent or malicious. It's only her money after him If they divorce otherwise this woman is just throwing their money away trying to bandaid her friends issue rather than help her solve it all behind her boyfriends back and I say boyfriend because this guy isn't her husband or partner she clearly doesn't trust him enough for that.", "Well it very much dependent if HE is allowed HIS assets to be not shared and put in a secret account or they had a shared expenses and assets approach. Marriage is not hiding in case is a team sharing choices.", "Now reverse the gender and reimagine your vitriol.", "Typical. OP's only getting a pass cause she's a female. If a dude had been secretly hiding money from his wife with the purpose of preventing his wife from getting any of it and then giving money to someone without speaking to his wife..... Oh man would he be getting fuckin ripped. \n\nBut nope... OP's a female so she's allowed to \"plan for something that may happen\".... And since she makes more... it's \"her money\".... \n\nReverse the roles..... A dude is the breadwinner in the family and has been secretly socking away money for the entire marriage.... For no reason other than his family said he should. Then, dude gives away $15,000 to his friend without even speaking to his wife.... He gonna get a pass???", "So everyone should have a secret bank account just in case their marriage doesn't work out? \n\nNot only is it absolutely ridiculous to bank on your marriage ending poorly.... In most states.... Hiding funds during a divorce is illegal.", "Not to disagree but I'd also agree if the man had a secret emergency fund. I see it as a sort of insurance. Many people get into a relationship with a seemingly kind and trustworthy partner, but then get put into an abusive situation. In reality, DV can happen quickly, especially if one partner is put into a vulnerable spot, ie. losing their job, being pregnant or falling into any sort of health issue, etc. People can become abusive after years, and we see it all the time in this sub.", "Right? Reddit also goes crazy when men ask for paternity tests when the woman has shown no hints of being unfaithful. \u201cYou should trust her! Why did you have a kid if you don\u2019t trust her! She\u2019s done nothing wrong!\u201d\n\nbut I guess squirreling money away in secret from a man who\u2019s shown no hints at being abusive and there are no huge problematic issues for 15 years is totally ok and encouraged. I could say the same to OP. \u201cWhy did you marry him if you thought he\u2019d fuck you over? You should trust him! He\u2019s done nothing wrong!\u201d\n\nHeck plenty of couples have separate accounts that they have sole control of, there was no need for the deception. It\u2019s typically a \u201cfun money\u201d account but Op could just have easily used it as her emergency fund as well.", "The fact she didn't tell him is my big problem with her choices. The savings choices he's made, possibly even the job he's worked at, were all predicated upon the assumption that this was all the money they had between them. Their existence may have changed his behaviour. Also, if she's lied to me about the finances, has she lied to me elsewhere? Trust is so precious. \n\nAnyway, that's my reasoning. I enjoyed your thoughtful and polite contribution.", "Because in most - though not all - marriages, people don\u2019t have separate finances to the degree of having accounts each other don\u2019t know about, and when they do it\u2019s typically still been agreed upon that they\u2019ll do that. \n\nMy wife is currently semi-unemployed (her place of work closed abruptly and she immediately got a part time job but hasn\u2019t found anything full time) and I\u2019m making the vast majority of our money right now, but that doesn\u2019t mean I get to make the vast majority of my financial decisions. \n\nPeople who are stay at home parents, as the most common example, should still have an equal say in financial decisions for their families, and if their spouses hid money from them and then gave away thousands without consulting them at all, most people on this sub would recognize that that wasn\u2019t okay - and I suspect that\u2019s because the genders would most likely be flipped.", "If she added any money made while they were married, half that money is his.", "Depends where you live, really, and on any preexisting arrangements. I\u2019m not a lawyer, so I can\u2019t speak to the legal scope of marital assets, but if the partners have an agreement that x money goes into shared finances and they each get x in \u201cpocket money\u201d or \u201cfun money\u201d, whatever you call it, then personally I don\u2019t see an issue with what each partner uses that money for being their own problem. In my marriage, we pool our salaries but take a small equal cut for personal spending. I know my husband saves a portion of his away in a personal account I can\u2019t see or touch, I do the same (we\u2019re also in Japan where joint accounts don\u2019t exist, lol), and I don\u2019t care what he spends it on or saves for, outside of things that would hurt our marriage (hypothetically, a stripper or something).", "Not affecting isn\u2019t the same as not disclosing, though. My husband and I do fine - we pool finances and take a small pre-agreed upon cut for personal savings/spending each month. However, if either of us found out the other had been withholding an extra portion of their salary in order to funnel that into a secret account, we\u2019d be pretty pissed. If it was out of the pre-agreed amount, then there\u2019s no issue.", "I don't know what kind of relationship you are in, but in mine, my partner can save up for whatever they want, as long as it's their money. If they want to give money to friends to help, it's entirely their choice, as long as it doesn't impact my life. I'm not there to parent my partner.", "100% !!!!\n\nIf a man did this, people would be absolutely freaking out.", "everyone should have a list of divorce lawyers on speed call too lol. \u201cNo honey our marriage is fine but you know\u2026 just in case\u201d /s", "Not to mention simply letting her husband know she was giving the money away could have avoided half of this. OP doesn't need permission, but it sure is nice for your spouse to know what's going on.", "But it\u2019s personal EMERGENCY savings for if the situation went bad. OP\u2019s friend is the exact example of why this sort of thing is needed. \n\nIf it goes bad, and he knows of it then he can try and run everything into the ground financially to try and control that money too. It\u2019s why it\u2019s a secret.", "Aaaah ok\u00e9. We just pile the money and if someone wants to spend it on something fun we just discuss if it goes above a certain value. We both know what can and can\u2019t be missed so it works perfect. But I guess this is a good way too. This way you can save some cash to buy something bigger. \n\nIf you go out to eat with a friend do you spend that money?", "Yeah, it depends on the relationship and the laws. My husband and I each have our own account, plus a joint account for bills. We get paid into our own accounts and we pay money into the joint account. But we don\u2019t police each others spending from the separate accounts. Now, I don\u2019t have $15k in my personal account but if I saved up money in there he wouldn\u2019t know, and if I then gave away that money he would not know if I told him. \n\nThat said, if I saved up $15k and then gave it away without discussing it with him, he would be pretty upset. And I definitely see why, that\u2019s not what I think of a good partnership and I wouldn\u2019t do it.", "That\u2019s you. I have a rainy day found my fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t know about. I personally know he has one too. One should always have funds to yourself that it something happens to your spouse or your spouse does something stupid. \n\nEverything doesn\u2019t have to be shared. Yes finances should be pooled for retirement, bills and more. Then whatever you do with your extra is on you. Wether that\u2019s saving or splurging.", "I'm in one where we don't HIDE things from each other... You know... Cause where I come from, a marriage is about this thing called TRUST.... What she\u2019s doing shows a complete lack of openness and honesty, which, of course, are two of the pillars of a healthy relationship. \n\nBottom line.... Feel free to save your money. Just don't keep it from your spouse. And when you're married..... You don't give away money without SPEAKING to your spouse..... You sit down and talk about it. You're not looking for permission, you're simply \"keeping your partner in the loop\".", "Fair enough! Cultural too, I reckon. I\u2019m married to a Japanese man, and it\u2019s really common here for the wife to hold all the money and give hubby handouts \ud83e\udd23 even if he\u2019s the sole earner. \n\nYup, in our case personal money is for anything \u201cnon-essential\u201d that we want for ourselves. That includes going out with friends, new clothes that aren\u2019t strictly necessary (we\u2019ll draw from shared finances to buy a replacement work shirt, or winter boots etc), fun items/hobby things, and some snack foods etc that aren\u2019t shared.

I\u2019d definitely be kinda shocked myself; probably more impressed he managed to accumulate that much though, lol. Still, wouldn\u2019t be able to argue with it if it was his own money. I actually kinda had this situation when my husband put a down payment on a motorbike. Was initially stunned and then frantic thinking he intended to pay for the remaining loan/gas etc with household funds, but he had budgeted for it being paid from his monthly cut. Worked fine!", "Yeah that\u2019s\u2026exactly the same as me? Aha\u2026  Pooled for household, plus our own cut we can spend or save. We aren\u2019t aware of what the other uses their personal share on, besides what we openly show each other."]}
