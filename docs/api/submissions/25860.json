Depending on your relationship, she's just setting herself up for regret later on.

The reception is of course not possible but maybe, an hour long ceremony can be something she can manage?", "No one is an AH here.\n\nYour daughter want's her Mum to attend the biggest day of her life.

Is it possible that her AH behavior could be stemming from the additional stress of her worrying about her mother post-accident?

They don't take long, aren't loud and she will probably be glad she didn't miss it a year from how.\n\nBut please try to give everyone a little grace.

Have your wife if she's comfortable wear them during the ceremony. The reception will be too stimulating I expect but this is my best advice.\n\nNot trying to guilt trip you, but you may only get one chance to see her get married. Its nice to know she values your presence at least but shes upset that her mother wont get to see her on her big day. Its part of many brides dreams to have their mum and dad in attendance.", "NTA, you daughter is upset that her mom won't be at the wedding and it's okay to feel that way. It's not okay though for her to not understand that it isn't practical for her mother to make it in her current condition.

I do realize how extremely difficult that would be but this is an extreme situation, truly extenuating circumstances. \n\nI can't imagine being your partner and missing my child's big (hopefully once in a lifetime) event, and I can't imagine being your daughter and not having my mom present.

It\u2019s understandable that your daughter is disappointed that her mom can\u2019t be there. And I\u2019m sure your wife is disappointed that she can\u2019t be there. But given the situation, the need for precautions is not just something your wife wants, it\u2019s something she needs. Your daughter is taking her disappointment too far and is being selfish. She\u2019s going to regret the decision to uninvite you in the long run I think. You might appeal to her through family or even her fianc\u00e9. It seems unreasonable to make this kind of stand given your wife\u2019s medical situation.", "NTA. WTF does she expect, her mother to be suffering for the whole thing?

Does she have some secret will to cause her mom a bunch of pain or is she that ignorant and needs to read up on how brain injuries work and how serious they are?!\nEither way, your daughter is being petulant and self centered.\nGlad Wifey is safely healing.", "NTA. Concussions are really serious and you absolutely cannot push yourself during the first little bit without severely compromising your healing. \n\nHas your wife spoken to a doctor about attending the wedding? Maybe if you approach this from a medical standpoint your daughter will be more understanding.", "Why not have her Mom help her get ready with her bridesmaids and maybe catch the ceremony and then go stay in a hotel room on the mountain for everything else? Mom and daughter can have some 1:1 time but miss all the party noises.", "INFO: what has the doctor advised? My understanding is that failing to rest post-concussion can set recovery way way back.\n\nCould you do a small/private mini ceremony with her mom before the actual ceremony?", "NTA! You hit the nail on the head- your daughter is being extremely selfish here.", "Is she in rehab or the hospital? \nIf she has been discharged to be home without any limitations seems likely she can attend. Ask your wife her thoughts and ask her physicians for what they would recommend. Tell the venue the situation and see if they could provide a quiet space for her to retire to if she get overwhelmed or uncomfortable. Most reception venues provide the bride with a private space to freshen up and rest. Your wife could use that. Generally,  the wedding ceremony is a peaceful affair; afterwards take her back to rehab after the wedding.  In my family, we have had a few folks with stories and we worked with the healthcare providers to greenlight their safe level of participation. Very often physicians encourage getting family reintroduced to family and social activities.  It can be beneficial for the patient.", "Watch it on FaceTime", "Sunday night.", "That sounds good in theory. But from the mom's point of view, that's a lot of hoops to jump through to be somewhere in pain and miserable and feeling uncomfortable. Not dancing or happy or able to really participate like she intended, being super conscious of the cast, the wheelchair, the giant ear muffs, the sunglasses, the pain... She'd probably have an awful time. Why would she want her mom to be miserable? Then, the daughter would probably complain about how miserable her parents looked and how it ruined her night anyway. Also, if the precautions somehow weren't enough and they tried to leave early, the daughter would probably guilt them as if they were never there at all. It's just a lose-lose situation all around for the parents. I would want to spare my mom pain above anything, and that makes the daughter selfish. I hope the mom feels better soon.

My wife also can\u2019t drive right now so if she leaves right after I need to leave right after. \n\nThe designation is not good for a wheelchair, it\u2019s a mountain wedding.  There are a lot of reason it just is a bad idea. That\u2019s why a FaceTime call was our best solution.", "Maybe I'm a crazy person, but this seems to be a case of the daughter \"wanting things to go right for her special day\" and the wife \"needing to avoid unnecessary stress.\"\n\nSurely the moral burden rests with the Person A wanting Person B to compromise on Person B's needs. \n\nI mean, I get that weddings are important because we have decided they are big days, but if the marriage is a good one, the mom can be around for like, the rest of their life.", "I can't imagine being your partner and missing my child's big (hopefully once in a lifetime) event, and I can't imagine being your daughter and not having my mom present.

Did you read that the wedding is this coming Sunday on a damn MOUNTAIN???? That's way too much for the wife in the wheelchair. Her health should matter the most. The only one who sucks is the daughter. They're trying to compromise, and she is not only telling her mom she can't watch the wedding in a way that's best for her but also disinviting OP altogether if he doesn't drag his injured wife up a damn mountain for her.
