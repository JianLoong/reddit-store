Have your wife if she's comfortable wear them during the ceremony. The reception will be too stimulating I expect but this is my best advice.\n\nNot trying to guilt trip you, but you may only get one chance to see her get married. Its nice to know she values your presence at least but shes upset that her mother wont get to see her on her big day. Its part of many brides dreams to have their mum and dad in attendance.", "NTA, you daughter is upset that her mom won't be at the wedding and it's okay to feel that way. It's not okay though for her to not understand that it isn't practical for her mother to make it in her current condition.

I do realize how extremely difficult that would be but this is an extreme situation, truly extenuating circumstances. \n\nI can't imagine being your partner and missing my child's big (hopefully once in a lifetime) event, and I can't imagine being your daughter and not having my mom present.

It\u2019s understandable that your daughter is disappointed that her mom can\u2019t be there. And I\u2019m sure your wife is disappointed that she can\u2019t be there. But given the situation, the need for precautions is not just something your wife wants, it\u2019s something she needs. Your daughter is taking her disappointment too far and is being selfish.

Concussions are really serious and you absolutely cannot push yourself during the first little bit without severely compromising your healing. \n\nHas your wife spoken to a doctor about attending the wedding?

You hit the nail on the head- your daughter is being extremely selfish here.", "Is she in rehab or the hospital? \nIf she has been discharged to be home without any limitations seems likely she can attend. Ask your wife her thoughts and ask her physicians for what they would recommend. Tell the venue the situation and see if they could provide a quiet space for her to retire to if she get overwhelmed or uncomfortable. Most reception venues provide the bride with a private space to freshen up and rest. Your wife could use that. Generally,  the wedding ceremony is a peaceful affair; afterwards take her back to rehab after the wedding.  In my family, we have had a few folks with stories and we worked with the healthcare providers to greenlight their safe level of participation. Very often physicians encourage getting family reintroduced to family and social activities.  It can be beneficial for the patient.", "Watch it on FaceTime", "Sunday night.", "That sounds good in theory. But from the mom's point of view, that's a lot of hoops to jump through to be somewhere in pain and miserable and feeling uncomfortable. Not dancing or happy or able to really participate like she intended, being super conscious of the cast, the wheelchair, the giant ear muffs, the sunglasses, the pain... She'd probably have an awful time. Why would she want her mom to be miserable? Then, the daughter would probably complain about how miserable her parents looked and how it ruined her night anyway. Also, if the precautions somehow weren't enough and they tried to leave early, the daughter would probably guilt them as if they were never there at all. It's just a lose-lose situation all around for the parents. I would want to spare my mom pain above anything, and that makes the daughter selfish. I hope the mom feels better soon.

Imagine a professional cameraman walking through the ceremony, with all that video going back to her mom at home in full 1080 resolution and crisp sound.

VERRRRYYYY long story short, I was grieving a boyfriend that passed a month before my sisters wedding, and we had broken up about 12 years prior (high school sweethearts, broke up, tried to get back together and never worked until last year, finally was working out, then boom he ded\u201d. We had broken up over my sister\u2019s *first* wedding years prior but he was supposed to come to the 2nd one since we made up, so.. I hope it makes sense how convoluted the feelings around all this are.\n\nIt was the most horrendous time of my life and I am still heavily struggling. But I was still there for my sister. I ended up getting altitude poisoning cause my dress was too tight (I have never had a problem with altitude so it was definitely the dress/extreme stress/suppressing grief). I threw up in front of everyone after pictures (I was MOH), I threw up during speeches so I missed mine, but I\u2019m still proud of myself that even though it sucks my own memory of my sisters wedding is mostly pain and struggle for me, but she had a beautiful night, our friends and family had a wonderful time, and it was all SOOOOOOOOOO worth it at the end. I don\u2019t care how much I suffered. I cared how much my sister enjoyed this beautiful day of hers and her new husbands. \n\nSorry to ramble.. I guess my point is just, there are almost ALWAYS going to be exceptions to weddings and issues.\n\nI don\u2019t remember what my point was, I\u2019m sorry.. I\u2019m just gonna leave this cause I guess I needed to vent and I spent a long time typing this out hah. Everyone needs different things.

There will be enough family members to help with the mother and if the mother gets too upset they can Wheel her off to the side.\n\nSo since he thinks FaceTime is the best way to go then he can stay with his wife and support her on the FaceTime call.\n\nI hope the daughter tries her very best to make arrangements for her mother since the dad doesn\u2019t want to.

Even if some accommodations are made, like dimmer lights, it seems unreasonable to assume that people aren't going to cheer at a wedding, music isn't going to be played loudly, no cameras are going to have flash, etc. Add in the mountain wedding AND the broken leg, and I just don't think it's feasible. \n\nOP, you are NTA.

I have several friends who held their ceremony at a nursing home or in a hospital so a close family member could be there. \n\nIf I\u2019m being charitable, I suspect that the daughter is in denial about how serious her mom\u2019s injuries were.

I have a vision impairment that acts up under certain lighting and brain conditions and people always have an incredibly hard time understanding or remembering because they can't SEE the injury (unless I make a huge mistake like trying to put a glass down on the counter and putting it down a foot away in midair instead, which has happened when it is bad). It's not great or empathetic that people have such a hard time grasping invisible injuries, but it is very very human and I would say the majority of people have this issue, including very smart people.

They aren\u2019t protecting her they are banning her because of her disability. I have been to weddings where grandma was in a wheelchair and not slightly with it but they were included in everything Even in the pictures. That to me shows love.

I think banning her from the wedding is mean and I think the husband is being mean to not even try something that will allow his wife to witness hopefully this once in a lifetime experience.\n\nI personally know how important it is for mothers to be with their daughters at their wedding. She was in an accident it\u2019s not her fault. there are ways to include her in the wedding and make it a good experience for all. If there\u2019s going to be a lot of family there that understand the situation I\u2019m sure that husband and other family members could be by her side and if things get to be too much they can take her outside until she\u2019s able to be with them.\n\nI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m going with YTA. There are ways to adjust especially for the mother. I would be sick if I was banned from my daughters wedding because of some thing that I could not control.

If she\u2019s willing to put up with her mother and possible problems then I think the husband should also be willing to help out. Banning her from the wedding is mean and cruel. Watching it on FaceTime is not the same as being there she can\u2019t participate in the cake cutting in the dinner and the dancing and all that. Not being able to experience the reception and the ceremony is just wrong.And making her stay at home watching it on the TV Because she is disabled is just plain mean. You all made this decision without even discussing it with the mother. That\u2019s just cruel\n\nThis also means she\u2019s going to be left out of the wedding pictures the thought of that just makes me cry I can\u2019t even imagine how mother would feel.

While both can be disabling, they are dealt with very differently. In the chronic phase, an injury is more or less stable (stable in the sense that it does not progress markedly on its own nor can it be improved much through treatment); in this phase, it is possible to work through various options to accomplish things such as participation in weddings, because while the person with the disability may need accommodations, the disability is not at risk of becoming worse as long as the accommodations are provided.\nIn the acute phase, injuries are both volatile and at risk of rapid or permanent worsening; this means that people with acute injuries must be extremely careful, because any overexertion can lead to permanent damages.\n\nDo you understand this distinction?\n\nThe mother has an acute injury to her brain. If she is allowed to rest and recuperate unimpeded, she may recover ENTIRELY. That is, no or little permanent damage. Do you really believe that she should risk permanent disability?
