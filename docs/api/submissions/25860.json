Have your wife if she's comfortable wear them during the ceremony. The reception will be too stimulating I expect but this is my best advice.\n\nNot trying to guilt trip you, but you may only get one chance to see her get married. Its nice to know she values your presence at least but shes upset that her mother wont get to see her on her big day.

It's not okay though for her to not understand that it isn't practical for her mother to make it in her current condition.

I do realize how extremely difficult that would be but this is an extreme situation, truly extenuating circumstances. \n\nI can't imagine being your partner and missing my child's big (hopefully once in a lifetime) event, and I can't imagine being your daughter and not having my mom present.

Mom and daughter can have some 1:1 time but miss all the party noises.", "INFO: what has the doctor advised?

You hit the nail on the head- your daughter is being extremely selfish here.", "Is she in rehab or the hospital? \nIf she has been discharged to be home without any limitations seems likely she can attend. Ask your wife her thoughts and ask her physicians for what they would recommend. Tell the venue the situation and see if they could provide a quiet space for her to retire to if she get overwhelmed or uncomfortable. Most reception venues provide the bride with a private space to freshen up and rest. Your wife could use that. Generally,  the wedding ceremony is a peaceful affair; afterwards take her back to rehab after the wedding.  In my family, we have had a few folks with stories and we worked with the healthcare providers to greenlight their safe level of participation. Very often physicians encourage getting family reintroduced to family and social activities.  It can be beneficial for the patient.", "Watch it on FaceTime", "Sunday night.", "That sounds good in theory. But from the mom's point of view, that's a lot of hoops to jump through to be somewhere in pain and miserable and feeling uncomfortable. Not dancing or happy or able to really participate like she intended, being super conscious of the cast, the wheelchair, the giant ear muffs, the sunglasses, the pain... She'd probably have an awful time. Why would she want her mom to be miserable? Then, the daughter would probably complain about how miserable her parents looked and how it ruined her night anyway. Also, if the precautions somehow weren't enough and they tried to leave early, the daughter would probably guilt them as if they were never there at all. It's just a lose-lose situation all around for the parents. I would want to spare my mom pain above anything, and that makes the daughter selfish. I hope the mom feels better soon.

I have to say, try not to be too hard on your daughter.  She\u2019s probably extremely stressed about the wedding, upset about your wife\u2019s accident, and now she doesn\u2019t think that either of her parents will be at her wedding.  \n\nIs the entire wedding and reception outside and up a mountain?  Will your daughter get ready somewhere else, or will she have a room where she\u2019ll get dressed?  Is there somewhere your wife can rest before and after the ceremony?  \n\nAs a disabled mum with physical disabilities, complex-PTSD, a heart condition and severe anxiety, I get very overwhelmed and suffer with sensory overload, so I sympathise with your wife.  That said, I would have to be literally tied to a hospital bed before I\u2019d miss my daughter\u2019s wedding.  \n\nIf you can\u2019t hire a wheelchair with off-road wheels, and if your wife can\u2019t take anti-nausea meds/painkillers, wear dark glasses and noise cancelling earbuds, then being there for the getting ready/seeing your daughter in her dress, and playing some part in the day, would be the next best thing.  There has to be some middle ground here.", "As a professional in the wedding industry I really think this is the best option.

This is something I would suggest if I was the planner in this situation.", "Does Doctor know it\u2019s on a mountain? Could the higher altitude affect her in a bad way? I\u2019d get as much info and advice from the doc as possible and relay it to your daughter. \n\nAt this point, FaceTime seems like the healthiest and easiest compromise. Other than doing a legal ceremony just for parents *at home*, there\u2019s not a lot of options here.", "could they get married in a tiny ceremony the day before so they are legally already married? for my part - having my mom at my wedding was the second most important thing to actually getting married. none of the other stuff mattered as much.", "I understands beautiful, but your wife\u2019s health needs to come first", "Mother's Blessing\n\nOnce the bride and groom are in front of the officiant, the officiant can read a Mother's  Blessing before starting the ceremony.\n\nOP can help Mom write the blessing due to her need for brain rest right now.\n\nThe daughter needs to wake up to the consequences of what she's insisting on. It's not respectful that she would pressure her Mom to do something that will set back her recovery and could cripple her for life. \n\nNO is a word that works. Be firm. Protect your wife. Make sure she gets the rest she needs at home.\n\nHopefully, Mom will be able to attend a renewal of vows in a year or two.", "Thank you!

The \"disabilty-friendly option\" is the one he suggested. His wife stays home and watches the exchange of vows on her computer, where she can control the brightness and sound. Even a brief visit to the wedding--whatever the price--could significantly set back her recovery.

While you can make her concussion disappear, could people help transport her briefly? Maybe to see her daughter before she goes down the aisle?
