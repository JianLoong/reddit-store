Have your wife if she's comfortable wear them during the ceremony.

Ask your wife her thoughts and ask her physicians for what they would recommend. Tell the venue the situation and see if they could provide a quiet space for her to retire to if she get overwhelmed or uncomfortable. Most reception venues provide the bride with a private space to freshen up and rest. Your wife could use that. Generally,  the wedding ceremony is a peaceful affair; afterwards take her back to rehab after the wedding.  In my family, we have had a few folks with stories and we worked with the healthcare providers to greenlight their safe level of participation.

Not dancing or happy or able to really participate like she intended, being super conscious of the cast, the wheelchair, the giant ear muffs, the sunglasses, the pain... She'd probably have an awful time. Why would she want her mom to be miserable? Then, the daughter would probably complain about how miserable her parents looked and how it ruined her night anyway. Also, if the precautions somehow weren't enough and they tried to leave early, the daughter would probably guilt them as if they were never there at all. It's just a lose-lose situation all around for the parents. I would want to spare my mom pain above anything, and that makes the daughter selfish. I hope the mom feels better soon.

VERRRRYYYY long story short, I was grieving a boyfriend that passed a month before my sisters wedding, and we had broken up about 12 years prior (high school sweethearts, broke up, tried to get back together and never worked until last year, finally was working out, then boom he ded\u201d.

I threw up in front of everyone after pictures (I was MOH), I threw up during speeches so I missed mine, but I\u2019m still proud of myself that even though it sucks my own memory of my sisters wedding is mostly pain and struggle for me, but she had a beautiful night, our friends and family had a wonderful time, and it was all SOOOOOOOOOO worth it at the end. I don\u2019t care how much I suffered. I cared how much my sister enjoyed this beautiful day of hers and her new husbands. \n\nSorry to ramble..

I have several friends who held their ceremony at a nursing home or in a hospital so a close family member could be there. \n\nIf I\u2019m being charitable, I suspect that the daughter is in denial about how serious her mom\u2019s injuries were.

I have a vision impairment that acts up under certain lighting and brain conditions and people always have an incredibly hard time understanding or remembering because they can't SEE the injury (unless I make a huge mistake like trying to put a glass down on the counter and putting it down a foot away in midair instead, which has happened when it is bad). It's not great or empathetic that people have such a hard time grasping invisible injuries, but it is very very human and I would say the majority of people have this issue, including very smart people.

It's not ok, it's not rational or logical and I do think she'll look back at this reaction with regret, but in the meantime I hope they can come to a solution together. By it's very nature, this sub encourages black and white thinking but when you're dealing with highly emotional situations that involved people you love and want to, you know, keep in your life, it's not as simple as going, \"you're wrong, I'm right, deal with it\" even when it's completely true! That's what makes this so hard. \n\nI feel absolutely awful for mom (who is probably really upset that she can't come), daughter (reasons state above) and OP, who is catching strays for literally just trying to protect his wife's health.

Throwing a tantrum because your mother won\u2019t risk lifelong disability due to a car wreck is a level of narcissistic immaturity that, if I were the fianc\u00e9, would seriously make me reconsider if she\u2019s adult enough to be in a relationship let alone married.", "You would be ok with putting a loved one with a traumatic brain injury in an Uber for a jolting, twisting ride back down a mountain by themselves?

You might have to financially push the wedding 2-3 years into the future.  It would make more sense to have a small ceremony before OR a moderate get together after her mom was well than it would be to postpone the wedding.  A week out (for my wedding at least) most people would have to cancel hotels and flights, potentially without refund.\n\nI get the sentiment, but really a wedding is like a freight train.

So anybody who has a disability should not be at weddings even their own child\u2019s wedding? Is it because they\u2019re afraid they might not do the right thing? They aren\u2019t protecting her they are banning her because of her disability. I have been to weddings where grandma was in a wheelchair and not slightly with it but they were included in everything Even in the pictures. That to me shows love. If FaceTime is the best then mom and dad should use FaceTime for the wedding seems fair to me. They could make it work if they wanted to but the family doesn\u2019t wanna be bothered.

Only you can answer if being in the right makes that okay with you.  \n\nTo your actual question, calling her selfish may have been warranted, but it certainly didn\u2019t help the situation. It does seem like there is no safe way for your wife to attend, but I can see how offering simply FaceTime as an alternative to having the support of your mother at your wedding could be extremely hurtful. I get you\u2019re going through a lot with your wife and probably didn\u2019t have the bandwidth to think of some better solutions.

A letter from the state medical board? Do 9 out of 10 dentists have to agree, or only 4 out of 5?", "Maybe read the whole fucking comment before you say something.", "Well one compromise would be that someone is always with the wife in a wheelchair and if things get too tough on her they could just quietly move her away. I think banning her from the wedding is mean and I think the husband is being mean to not even try something that will allow his wife to witness hopefully this once in a lifetime experience.\n\nI personally know how important it is for mothers to be with their daughters at their wedding. She was in an accident it\u2019s not her fault. there are ways to include her in the wedding and make it a good experience for all. If there\u2019s going to be a lot of family there that understand the situation I\u2019m sure that husband and other family members could be by her side and if things get to be too much they can take her outside until she\u2019s able to be with them.\n\nI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m going with YTA. There are ways to adjust especially for the mother. I would be sick if I was banned from my daughters wedding because of some thing that I could not control. I guess that\u2019s why you ban people with health issues and people who don\u2019t behave the way they want them to because of her illness.\n\nI applaud your daughter for sticking with her mother. If she\u2019s willing to put up with her mother and possible problems then I think the husband should also be willing to help out. Banning her from the wedding is mean and cruel. Watching it on FaceTime is not the same as being there she can\u2019t participate in the cake cutting in the dinner and the dancing and all that. Not being able to experience the reception and the ceremony is just wrong.And making her stay at home watching it on the TV Because she is disabled is just plain mean. You all made this decision without even discussing it with the mother. That\u2019s just cruel\n\nThis also means she\u2019s going to be left out of the wedding pictures the thought of that just makes me cry I can\u2019t even imagine how mother would feel. Has anybody even discussed this with the mother and daughter or are they just making decisions based on how everybody else feels.\n\nI\u2019m glad your daughter loves her mother so much that she\u2019s willing to put up with her disability at her wedding.
