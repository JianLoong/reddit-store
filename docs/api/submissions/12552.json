They are still young enough to need more regular supervision.  \n\nI\u2019d sit down with the ex and step dad and explain that the sitter does much more that watch the kids and that they need more supervision than step dad can provide, even WFH.  Say you\u2019d be willing to revisit the subject in 2 years when the kids are 12 and 10.\n\nInfo(for my own curiosity -no judgement):why do all of you live under one roof?", "So to me it sounds like multiple things are going on in OPs head. \n1. You can\u2019t reduce the hours of a nanny and expect them to stay on. It\u2019s kind of all or nothing because they need gainful employment. So that would mean giving up this guy and finding a new babysitter if a part time babysitter was still needed.  \n2. The only way I see a conflict of interest is if you have a problem with how step dad and or your ex parent the children. You can\u2019t tell your coparent how to parent, but that also might mean you don\u2019t want to relinquish daily child care to them. \n3. The step father will still be working from home? So he won\u2019t actually be babysitting the kids. I mean they might not need *that much* at 8 and 10, but they\u2019ve had someone in their lives actually being attentive to them for those hours and that seems like it would change. The babysitter might be making snacks, helping with homework, doing little activities with them and I think that\u2019s valuable. \n\nI have a hard time saying that OP is  an AH\u2026but I think you will have to compromise. And the only compromise I can think of right now is asking your babysitter to reduce his hours and you pay for it yourself. If he can\u2019t, you\u2019ll have to find a new sitter. \n\nNAH", "You are not the asshole, child care is more important than money, and if it is safe to spend the amount you already are on a babysitter that you trust, why should anyone have a problem with that?

Creepy.", "If it was a 43 year old woman that was a career nanny would you say the same thing?  Eight year olds are capable of bathing themselves, but need to be told.  He is probably just making sure the kid gets in the shower.", "Where does it say he bathes them? It says he makes sure they're bathed. My youngest is 7 and if he's told it's bath time he takes one.", "With an 8-year-old, the sitter is more likely to be just making sure the kid takes a bath, doesn\u2019t get hurt in the process, and gets done in reasonable time, than to be actively washing. However, he has been with the family long enough to have been present for the stages when the boys needed actual bathing. This is\u2026not that big a deal.", "I laughed so hard at that. \"Some guy named Dave. Also we live together and have for years\"", "I was going to say something but every-time Reddit gets weirdos doing crazy shit with kids and I mention red flags everyone downvotes me.", "So true. Its bizarre", "They have the top floor and I have the bottom. I do not see them a lot.", "[deleted]", "This right here", "OP said he will if they move out. All 5 of them live together", "All of them live in the same house together, so parenting time is probably non existent.", "An 8 and 10yr old shouldn\u2019t need much supervision, especially if it\u2019s only for a couple of hours.", "She said after school so there MIGHT only be an hour till the stepdad is off work. Or maybe his schedule is more flexible\u2026either way, he\u2019ll be home and there\u2019s no need for a nanny/babysitter to pay for", "I agree. The sitter helps more than just doing child care. Dave may be the step dad but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s good with kids, and since he WFH they won\u2019t have his full attention. Plus, good sitters are really hard to find. Letting him go would be my final option.", ">why should anyone have a problem with that?\n\nBecause you're charging them, rather than have the child stay with someone who is also clearly trusted, their stepdad.\n\n>Plus, what would the kids think?\n\nThat the babysitter isn't needed.", "This logic makes literally no sense.", "I felt like that part was the only thing that makes sense here. I'm guessing with the babysitter he has some agency over how his kids are raised, but with the stepdad he would have none.", "The age comment made me laugh. Wow. What is with this guy?", "I'm the sole parent of my child. I'm afraid to say that even extended family who have been in my kid's life since the sonogram would become back bench if I had a partner willing to step in, let alone a babysitter I'm paying. This is a massive ego-fight and nothing has to do with the kids. It's disgusting. OP You know YTA. Deal with your partner moving on. Step seems like an amazing guy. Maybe get to know him.", "And if they don't need to pay childcare they can probably move out and you will finally have to deal with the fact that your relationship with your wife is over. It's scary, but it's time my man.", "You know what would help you save some money? Letting go of the expensive babysitter...", "Cheaper than an insanely expensive babysitter? This whole situation seems insane.", "Op, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re getting the hint. They want him to babysit, or you pay 100% for childcare so they can save up TO MOVE OUT. I highly doubt the new husband wants to live with you, and I don\u2019t blame him, and not for the obvious reasons like you being the ex husband", "So do you know the step-dad well? Or did she just move a random guy in?", "If you all had money to burn, I believe you would not be living with someone you don't even want to acknowledge. So, maybe not paying a babysitter just for spite would be for the best.", "In that case you should be fine with their stepdad \u201cbabysitting\u201d when your kids are on their side of the house and you can pay for the babysitter when your kids are on your side of the house.", "In that case, your ex & Dave can tell the babysitter that his services are no longer required for the time that the kids are with their step dad.", "Do you even hear yourself?", "Then they don\u2019t have to use creepy old man as a baby sitter because bio dad has \u201cissues\u201d\nLetting go of his ex wife.\n\nYTA OP.  Grow the f up, accept you\u2019re divorced, put on your big boy pants, and move on and out.", "Jesus Christ dude. You are such a moron.  What does that have to do with the comment?", "Living together has nothing to do with it...all that means is that it's even easier to divide up the time in a convenient way. You could split the time any number of ways (some exactly even, some not): MWF/TuTh, 3pm-5pm/5pm-7pm, even days/odd days, every other week, etc.\n\nThe fact that you have decided that \"obviously that's not going to work\" makes it clear that you aren't interested in seriously considering a compromise.\n\nAnd I wasn't proposing that the sitter take a pay cut, I was suggesting that you maintain the same hourly rate for fewer hours. It's extremely common for sitters to have to work for more than one family to get all the hours they want, especially as kids get older and don't need the same level of supervision. \n\nAnd if the sitter is only willing to work for you if you maintain the number of hours, then you are getting close to the point of losing them anyway... Your kids are at an age where they are likely to start getting involved in after-school activities, lessening their need for a full-time babysitter.\n\nI get that you feel like the sitter is family (and I'm not going to deny that they may have an affectionate and loving relationship with your kids), but this is still a job for them. And one of their employers has decided that she no longer needs their services.", "Info how do you expect to stop them? All she has to do is talk to the sitter and explain she doesn\u2019t need to employ him during her half of the custody time", "You want to keep the babysitter then you pay for it, she wants her husband to look after them and he wants to as he WFH so she shouldn\u2019t have to pay for the babysitter, if you didn\u2019t all live together you would be paying his full fee anyway or is it you can\u2019t afford the babysitter without you ex paying half?", "If I was your ex, you just wouldn't be getting babysitter money. If what I do on my side of the house is my business, the babysitter would no longer be allowed on my side and I wouldn't pay for what he did on your side.", "You seem weirdly defensive of your kids\u2019 nanny\u2026you sure nothing\u2019s going on there?", "What, is the third in a thruple or something? What is the attachment to a babysitter?\n\nYTA for not budging on this, their stepfather can watch them for free. It's your babysitter who needs a new gig.", "Obviously? No. It\u2019s not obvious. It makes no difference that you live together.\n\nWhat is obvious is that you have no interest in compromising. You only care about making your exs life as difficult as possible. You\u2019re a stupid irrational person.  That is abundantly clear and obvious.", "> But specifically in this case he'd be taking over the babysitter duties\n\nThat's like saying a mom that goes on maternity leave is taking over the babysitter duties lol.\n\nThe babysitter is no longer needed and OP is clearly being a 5 star clinger to his ex and is threatened by \"some guy named dave\".", "You don't have a clue about this. You don't know what his job is or the demands. And the kids are 8 and 10. Not toddlers. They should be fully capable of entertaining themselves while an adult is nearby for supervision. \n\nMy kids get off the bus when I have about an hour of work left. I plan my day to be mostly done before they get home. Then they usually play at the park, with neighbor kids, etc as I finish up. By 11 I was babysitting kids.", "WFH for a decade here with kids the same age. It's hard trying to split your attention, but focus on work at the same time. It's a skillset that needs to be developed over time. If this new dad can do it from the start and continue to keep it up, then that's pretty rare. Somehow when the word home comes in, people think work is easy.", "Yes but you\u2019ve said the reason you live together is because it\u2019s cheaper.  So wouldn\u2019t having Dave watch his step kids give you and your ex wife more financial freedom and independence?  Unless Dave has done something to prove him incompetent of watching the kids or mistreats them, I don\u2019t understand why this is an issue.", "You don't get to decide the childcare arrangements your ex decides works best for her during her 50% of the custody time. You can keep the babysitter for you portion of the time, but your ex should decide what she wants to do for her time. \n\nYTA", "Yes but you also have a 3rd adult living in the home", "Nobody thinks like that. Because most people aren\u2019t that stupid.\n\nPeople who have half a brain would instead say \u201cwhy pay sitter when a parent is available to watch the kids\u201d\n\nAgain, you have to not be a complete moron to understand this reasoning so good luck.", "From now on, when I see someone post that their ex-wife got remarried, I\u2019m going to automatically think it is to \u201csome guy named Dave.\u201d", "It's one thing to make sure a kid is bathed, it's a whole other problem when a non-related adult is bathing an 8 year old.\n\nUnless that 8 year old is developmentally delayed in some way, why aren't they bathing themselves? Why is the babysitter doing it?", "My take was that the babysitter was watching the kids after school. It\u2019s one thing to tell an 8 year old to take a shower before bed, but why is an 8 year old taking his shower before dinner? The day\u2019s not close to being over. Or does OP keep the sitter working after dinner, too?", "I think you're in the serious minority on what constitutes a \"modern family dynamic\"", "Split families that do not get along living together is just a bad idea overall.", "So op gets to just demand who lives in a house they all share? Op is the only one that wants the sitter so he should pay for it. OP won\u2019t move out because that involves letting his ex have the house, presumably she won\u2019t move out for the same reason\u2026 it\u2019s a stalemate and not really related to the sitter issue.", "Thanks", "Wrong", "I understand your point, but the text states the fact that the children love their babysitter, so they would miss him. And about charging them money, it is understandable that the stepdad wouldn\u2019t cost money, but it is OP\u2019s children too. Both parents have agreed with this babysitter, OP doesn\u2019t need to change his parenting plan that was agreed upon just because his ex wanted. I hope I worded that correctly.", "Why? Just curious", "How many parents do an 8 year old and 10 year old need in one house?  Based on his description of the sitter, 4 I guess?", "Just some guy named Dave.", "Seems like the other two are clinging by refusing to move out?  Also, the stepdad isn't going to do the same job - he's wfh.  At best he's going to occasionally check on the kids to make sure they're ok.  The babysitter is constantly with the kids, and also does housework.", "> give your ex wife more financial freedom and independence? \n\nThat's the problem for OP.", "But Dave is WFH. So he\u2019s not really watching the kids, helping with homework, cleaning the common areas, etc.  Dave is still working. Keep the nanny", "I wanna believe that's a typo and he means to say that the babysitter makes sure the 8 year old is bathed.", "OP has never said the sitter physically bathes his kids, only that they make sure the kids have bathed", "Even a related adult shouldn't bathe an 8 year old", "It might depend on when adults are home from work. Idk about you but I sometimes work until 11pm. Again I'm not saying something fucked up *can't* be going on, this whole situation is a little strange overall...  But I wouldn't assume abuse if he'd said his babysitter was a woman. And I don't think anyone else would either. \n\nAgain, not saying terrible shit *can't* be afoot- but after reading this a few times I'm really not getting the impression that anything inappropriate is going on. As for when showers are convenient -- when I had roommates (we had one shower 5 people here) I had my kid shower after school a lot so that the bathroom was free for the other working adults with varying schedules.", "Lol, lkr?  Some people are so open minded their brains fall the fuck out.", "Of course not I forgot to put the /s at the end of it to show I was being sarcastic", "No, not wrong.

But, only OP wants to go with the option that costs money. So, if that's the option they go with, he should foot the bill.", "So invite the sitter to join in on family stuff sometimes.", "> You are not the asshole, child care is more important than money, and if it is safe to spend the amount you already are on a babysitter that you trust\n\nThis is just OP's opinion. I seriously doubt the wife and step dad feel the same way.", "Okay but how long have you all actually been living together and have you known him?", "> Seems like the other two are clinging by refusing to move out\n\nOP has said they only live together because of financial necessity. A necessity that probably won't exist if they don't have to pay this sitter", "We're not clinging to anything.\n\nWhy would we move out to a smaller place but pay more in rent? We live in a rent controlled house for  $2300 a month. Similar houses are renting for $4000.", "For that kid's sake, I really freaking hope so.", "I helped my kids wash their hair and scrub sometimes at that age. We live near the beach and sand is really hard to get out. Also, they liked that I could make the washcloth more bubbly than they could. It's odd to me that a parent helping a child bathe is sexualized. Other cultures share bathing responsibilities and nobody bats an eye. The beginning of Totoro the movie, when the dad and kids are bathing for example, creeps some Americans out. There's nothing wrong with it in Japanese culture.", "Right? My daughter was around that age when she wanted nothing to do with me when it came to anything washroom related.", "True, but it's even worse when the adult isn't a relative. If it's a parent, it could be something sinister, or it could be them spoiling and babying the kid by not making them do anything for themselves and being the type of people who raise lazy, useless adults who can barely wipe their own butts and need Mommy and Daddy to do everything for them.\n\nWhen it's someone else, however, even if it is indeed completely innocent, it's still suspicious as fuck from the outside.", "> Why would we move out to a smaller place but pay more in rent\n\nSo they don't have an awkward 3rd wheel ex hanging around.", "Why don\u2019t you move out then Op.", "No no no. Not \"we\" move out. The question is why don't YOU move out?", "I never spoke about sexualization, i think that at 8 a kid should know how to bathe themselves.\n\nIt's more a matter of independence for me", "Especially when it\u2019s a 43-year-old dude, unfortunately."]}
