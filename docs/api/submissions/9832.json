There has never been any sort of romantic or sexual connection between us. Ever.\n\nQuick context: He is an emotionally stunted, codependent mess with a victim complex and only just recently started therapy for some pretty heavy trauma he's been carrying around since his childhood. \n\nRelated context: He is a seemingly nice guy and will always help when asked and he's quick to offer help and other things when he sees an opportunity, and never without a \"No problem, don't worry about it.\" But then, when HE needs a favor or something that I'm not real feeling up to, he immediately reminds me of all the nice things he's done for me. He's guilt tripped me several times and it's lead me to decline any and every offer he's tried to make in the past couple years because I know what he'll eventually do when he wants something.\n\n\nEDIT to add: I accepted these offers because I was unaware of what he was doing at the time. It was only through that process that I learned that he was using his favors as a sort of currency. I WOULD return those favors when he reminded me of \"all the nice things\" he's done for me, but once I realized what he was doing, I stopped accepting anything further.\n\nSo now I've finally found my own place and I'm moving this weekend. Whenever I mention anything about moving things up to my new house, he offers to help. I politely decline, he presses, I keep declining, and he usually ends with a \"Well it's an open offer so just let me know.\" I have not let him help me with any of it so far because I really, really do not want to help him (and I know he'll try to rope me into it anyway). I've been holding his hand for so long and I'm exhausted. I believe he needs to find his own help that isn't his convenient roommate with a vehicle (he doesn't have a car). \n\nI feel like I'm just exercising my boundaries but I still feel like a bit of a shithead for it.

You\u2019ve been operating under impression that relationships are not reciprocal, that you were SHOCKED to find out people return favors. You\u2019re also unable to have a direct conversation with a human you\u2019ve known for YEARS. \u201cRoommate, thanks for offering, but I would rather handle it myself. I won\u2019t be around to help you move out later on, so I\u2019d feel badly about it.\u201d When he brings it up again, \u201chey thanks, but we\u2019ve discussed that topic.\u201d Change subject.\n\nI\u2019m gonna say YTA because your roommate isn\u2019t the only one stunted in this situation.", "What's the difference between codependent and dependent? Can an individual person be \"codependent\" or is that term just for multiple people who are toxically dependent on each other? I've had a hard time trying to define what codependency is as a trait in an individual person but as far as I can tell he fits it to a T... Only I'm not codependent on him in return. Is that just simply called dependency?", "I accepted these offers because I was unaware of what he was doing at the time.

It's nice when there's reciprocation but it's not nice when someone expects everything they do is for future favors.", "Codependent people sacrifice everything for a relationship. They don't make demands. They just keep taking care of other people and set their own needs aside. They are enablers and will do anything to maintain the peace.", "Did he do nice things for you, regardless?", "It is not something we can comment on without seeing to be honest.\n\nI personally have too much pride to call in favours but it doesn't mean I can't identify a parasite. There's a growing trend of people who think it is acceptable to take and take, hiding behind the belief that if people were actually nice they wouldn't expect anything in return.", "That also sounds like him... He's a very twisted up knot of trauma responses and exhibits symptoms of many different \"disorders\". Living with him has been just shy of a nightmare only because I've known him for so long, I know WHY he is the way he is, so I can't blame him really. He just hasn't been doing what he needs to do to get better (until just a couple weeks ago when I started moving my stuff out, he finally had his first therapy session. Hope he sticks with it.) It's the main reason I'm moving really.", "Well, sort of? Like he sometimes brings snacks or desserts home from work (grocery store) and leaves a note that says \"Have some\" so like, that's nice, but I also didn't ask him to. If I partake of anything he brings home, I'll bring home something to share in return the next time I'm out. But if I don't want to reciprocate, then I don't take any. \n\nI also don't ASK him to do anything for me. The few times I ever did need help, I returned the favor. I needed a ride to the store one time after a surgery (he drove, in my car, as he doesn't have a vehicle), and I've given him rides to work a few times in return. I know how and when to return gestures, but I also don't think I should be obligated to return favors I didn't ask for in the first place when I know from experience they'll be used against me later.", "It's not doing something nice if there are strings attached and the person always uses the \"favors\" to cash in on future demands.", "Codependent people do not keep tabs on what they do for other people so they can \"collect\".

Please!", "I dont think thats a good definition of codependency. Codependent are dependent.\nCodependent people arent emotionless beings just sacrificing everything for a relationship. Like with anything there is a range, some will be manipulative and others wont.\n\nThey are depending more on their partner or friend than is usual. That means they are more likely to be jealous or scared that they cant control their partner. Feeling like the person they are dependent on has all the control and they have none. If they are only addressing that through indirect means then all thats left is manipulation.", "How did you read what they wrote and say \u201cthat sounds like my roommate?\u201d It sounds like nothing you described.
