There has never been any sort of romantic or sexual connection between us. Ever.\n\nQuick context: He is an emotionally stunted, codependent mess with a victim complex and only just recently started therapy for some pretty heavy trauma he's been carrying around since his childhood. \n\nRelated context: He is a seemingly nice guy and will always help when asked and he's quick to offer help and other things when he sees an opportunity, and never without a \"No problem, don't worry about it.\" But then, when HE needs a favor or something that I'm not real feeling up to, he immediately reminds me of all the nice things he's done for me. He's guilt tripped me several times and it's lead me to decline any and every offer he's tried to make in the past couple years because I know what he'll eventually do when he wants something.\n\n\nEDIT to add: I accepted these offers because I was unaware of what he was doing at the time. It was only through that process that I learned that he was using his favors as a sort of currency. I WOULD return those favors when he reminded me of \"all the nice things\" he's done for me, but once I realized what he was doing, I stopped accepting anything further.\n\nSo now I've finally found my own place and I'm moving this weekend. Whenever I mention anything about moving things up to my new house, he offers to help. I politely decline, he presses, I keep declining, and he usually ends with a \"Well it's an open offer so just let me know.\" I have not let him help me with any of it so far because I really, really do not want to help him (and I know he'll try to rope me into it anyway). I've been holding his hand for so long and I'm exhausted. I believe he needs to find his own help that isn't his convenient roommate with a vehicle (he doesn't have a car). \n\nI feel like I'm just exercising my boundaries but I still feel like a bit of a shithead for it.

You\u2019ve been operating under impression that relationships are not reciprocal, that you were SHOCKED to find out people return favors. You\u2019re also unable to have a direct conversation with a human you\u2019ve known for YEARS. \u201cRoommate, thanks for offering, but I would rather handle it myself. I won\u2019t be around to help you move out later on, so I\u2019d feel badly about it.\u201d When he brings it up again, \u201chey thanks, but we\u2019ve discussed that topic.\u201d Change subject.\n\nI\u2019m gonna say YTA because your roommate isn\u2019t the only one stunted in this situation.", "What's the difference between codependent and dependent? Can an individual person be \"codependent\" or is that term just for multiple people who are toxically dependent on each other? I've had a hard time trying to define what codependency is as a trait in an individual person but as far as I can tell he fits it to a T... Only I'm not codependent on him in return. Is that just simply called dependency?", "I accepted these offers because I was unaware of what he was doing at the time.

It's nice when there's reciprocation but it's not nice when someone expects everything they do is for future favors.", "Codependent people sacrifice everything for a relationship. They don't make demands. They just keep taking care of other people and set their own needs aside. They are enablers and will do anything to maintain the peace.", "Did he do nice things for you, regardless?", "It is not something we can comment on without seeing to be honest.\n\nI personally have too much pride to call in favours but it doesn't mean I can't identify a parasite. There's a growing trend of people who think it is acceptable to take and take, hiding behind the belief that if people were actually nice they wouldn't expect anything in return.", "That also sounds like him... He's a very twisted up knot of trauma responses and exhibits symptoms of many different \"disorders\". Living with him has been just shy of a nightmare only because I've known him for so long, I know WHY he is the way he is, so I can't blame him really. He just hasn't been doing what he needs to do to get better (until just a couple weeks ago when I started moving my stuff out, he finally had his first therapy session. Hope he sticks with it.) It's the main reason I'm moving really.", "Well, sort of? Like he sometimes brings snacks or desserts home from work (grocery store) and leaves a note that says \"Have some\" so like, that's nice, but I also didn't ask him to. If I partake of anything he brings home, I'll bring home something to share in return the next time I'm out. But if I don't want to reciprocate, then I don't take any. \n\nI also don't ASK him to do anything for me. The few times I ever did need help, I returned the favor. I needed a ride to the store one time after a surgery (he drove, in my car, as he doesn't have a vehicle), and I've given him rides to work a few times in return. I know how and when to return gestures, but I also don't think I should be obligated to return favors I didn't ask for in the first place when I know from experience they'll be used against me later.", "It's not doing something nice if there are strings attached and the person always uses the \"favors\" to cash in on future demands.", "Codependent people do not keep tabs on what they do for other people so they can \"collect\".

Please!", "I dont think thats a good definition of codependency. Codependent are dependent.\nCodependent people arent emotionless beings just sacrificing everything for a relationship. Like with anything there is a range, some will be manipulative and others wont.\n\nThey are depending more on their partner or friend than is usual. That means they are more likely to be jealous or scared that they cant control their partner. Feeling like the person they are dependent on has all the control and they have none. If they are only addressing that through indirect means then all thats left is manipulation.", "How did you read what they wrote and say \u201cthat sounds like my roommate?\u201d It sounds like nothing you described.

So entitled.", "A lot of women are raised with the idea that they have to keep people around them happy, that they are the peacemakers and people-pleasers.\n\nThat gets confused with not having healthy boundaries.\n\nIT IS OK TO SAY NO, and it is ok for someone to not be happy with you. Not everybody has to like you, and not everybody has to be happy with your decisions.\n\nYour flatmate is an emotional leech. *It is common sense and self-preservation to draw firm boundaries.* You are doing the right thing.\n\nNTA", "He does not. I'm not going to tell him until he's settled somewhere else. Honestly though, he's not a threat to me.

He has had a bond with you for years and now you're leaving. He may find himself escalating to keep his access to you open. Just be careful.", "He doesn\u2019t fit it. What you have just described is prohibitive for him being codependent. Why are you making this *such* a thing?", "Friendship isn't transactional.\n\nIt took me a lot longer than you did to realise people in my life were holding 'favours' they did for me as power over me.\n\n(Also, another warning sign is if you've thanked them more than twice and they still expect you to be grateful, but that's another story...)\n\nCut him out and look after yourself.

Absolutely worth the cost to not have a headache of trying to get everything packed/loaded/moved. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for not wanting his help, but you would be if you accepted it knowing how he uses his help as transactional.\n\nETA: some people use these favors as a way to keep you in their life and control you in a way.  Evaluate how much you actually want his friendship in your life.", "There is nothing wrong with a friendship running its course and ending. Are you planning to hang out with him in the future? Are you willing to leave that opening for him to guilt you for something? Guilt you into helping him because you left him vulnerable now and look what steps he's making to improve doesn't that mean you should spend time with him. \n\nSee where this is going?", "NTA, but be more direct. Say \u201cI have moving covered, and I\u2019d prefer to do this all on my own.\u201d The next time he brings it up, ask: \u201cI\u2019ve already said no. Why aren\u2019t you respecting my no?\u201d It\u2019s okay to set boundaries and point out when he\u2019s crossed them.", "I wonder why, though, such a roommate has to mention favors done for OP. Like, I\u2019ve had roommates, tons of them. There\u2019s a social contract for humans sharing a space: don\u2019t eat my stuff, use the candle when you poop, etc. This is, like, basic manners. This is Kindergarten consideration.\n\nWhat grinds my gears are teenagers and libertarians on this sub crying, \u201cnoOOoOoo, don\u2019t do ANYTHING you don\u2019t ever wanna do!!!\u201d My friend, adulthood is a long line of doing things you don\u2019t wanna do: taxes, calling customer service, making small talk with your boyfriend\u2019s stupid MAGA colleague at his company holiday party. \n\nBut you know what? It makes the world go \u2018round. It means that I take care of you, and you take care of me. When a roommate was too exhausted to do her shopping, hey, np, use some of my eggs and butter. He gets stuck out of town on a gig? Yeah, sure, I\u2019ll go start your car for a bit so the battery doesn\u2019t die. Can you imagine if, at some point later, she refused to let me use a cup of sugar, \u201cbecause it\u2019s not like I owe you anything?\u201d If he refused to help me bring some groceries upstairs, because it\u2019s so RUDE I expect him to do something just because I helped him earlier that year?\n\nFrom the original post, it seems OP resents her roommate in exactly the same way. It makes me think that the roommate brings up past favors because, otherwise, OP would never offer to help.", "Put salient details in edits. Your posts complains about returning favors you\u2019ve ACCEPTED. Why would I go hunting for information that contradicts your own statement, ie he mentions offers that weren\u2019t accepted. \n\nAnyway, you\u2019re spending so much time feeling bad about a person you\u2019re not even going to talk to anymore, you\u2019ve come to internet strangers for validation.", "If someone offers you a cookie out of nowhere and you accept, are you indebted to them for an equal favor back in the future? No, because they OFFERED, you didn\u2019t ASK. Him offering under the pretense that it\u2019s a free gesture and then guilting her later for something else is manipulative and it\u2019s not what friends do. He\u2019s shown enough of this behavior in the past that she knows what to expect from his offer of help packing. And he continues to ask after she\u2019s turned him down. They both are clearly aware that the other knows what the situation is but he thinks he can wear her down so he can get help in the future that\u2019s why he keeps asking. Must be exhausting for OP just trying to keep the peace.", "You can blame him though. We are not responsible for becoming traumatized and developing abusive behaviors in response. But we are responsible for realizing that and doing something about it."]}
