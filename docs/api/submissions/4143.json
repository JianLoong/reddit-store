I do however see the behavior as abusive though because husband is making decisions that significantly affect the wife\u2019s work, well-being, and comfort in her home. Everyone deserves to have agency over themselves and their home environment. Husband told wife what was going to happen in her home. He forced her into a situation she didn\u2019t want to be in.
