This story is very strange. \n\nOP also says she doesn't know why they would pull the kids out of school... but if they have to drive 4 hrs round trip plus loading and unloading time, it might make sense that they could figure they wouldn't be back in time to get the kids", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
