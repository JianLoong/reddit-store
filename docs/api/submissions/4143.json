I immediately told him hell no, as today was my biggest annual meeting with one of our biggest clients, who is a local chain of retailers. I am the associate director the partnership between our companys and so I would have to help give a presentation. However, he kept telling me that they had just told him they were coming over. I finally relented but told him that the kids would need to be quiet and could not be upstairs. \n\nAnyways, today swings around and I go to get ready. My daughter locks her room so that the kids can't get in. Inside, she has a gaming setup worth over $2000 of gifts and stuff she has saved up from waitresses. I also locked my doors after I got my lunch. At about 1, they arrived over. I was in the middle of my meeting at this point. While, about 20 minutes later I hear 2 steps of small footsteps run up the stairs. They immediately start trying to get into my daughter's room (which is right next to my office). I immediately started texting and calling my husband but he didn't respond. About 5 minutes later, I excused myself to the restroom, just as the kids went into my daughter's room. I kicked them downstairs and told them not to come back. \n\nA little later, after I got back to my meeting I could hear the kids screaming from downstairs. Again, I text my husband and nothing happens. It stayed that way until 4:45 when my meeting was finished. I then went down to my husbands office and just let loose. Among other things I called him a \"little fucking pussy\". I then grabbed my daughter and took her to my parents house where I will be staying the night. I honestly feel if I am on the edge of divorce.\n\nThis post may be a mess because I am still worked up?\n\nEdit: I am going to sleep for the night. Tomorrow morning I am gonna get my laptop from the house. Will check in on her setup and all my other stuff. I am gonna stay at my parents house for a few days. I am definitely gonna talk to therapists and reflect.
