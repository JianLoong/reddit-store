I immediately told him hell no, as today was my biggest annual meeting with one of our biggest clients, who is a local chain of retailers. I am the associate director the partnership between our companys and so I would have to help give a presentation. However, he kept telling me that they had just told him they were coming over. I finally relented but told him that the kids would need to be quiet and could not be upstairs. \n\nAnyways, today swings around and I go to get ready. My daughter locks her room so that the kids can't get in. Inside, she has a gaming setup worth over $2000 of gifts and stuff she has saved up from waitresses. I also locked my doors after I got my lunch. At about 1, they arrived over. I was in the middle of my meeting at this point. While, about 20 minutes later I hear 2 steps of small footsteps run up the stairs. They immediately start trying to get into my daughter's room (which is right next to my office). I immediately started texting and calling my husband but he didn't respond. About 5 minutes later, I excused myself to the restroom, just as the kids went into my daughter's room. I kicked them downstairs and told them not to come back. \n\nA little later, after I got back to my meeting I could hear the kids screaming from downstairs. Again, I text my husband and nothing happens. It stayed that way until 4:45 when my meeting was finished. I then went down to my husbands office and just let loose. Among other things I called him a \"little fucking pussy\". I then grabbed my daughter and took her to my parents house where I will be staying the night.

It sounds like your husband was also working.\n\n\nYour NTA, I\u2019m just curious on why they needed to come over", "NTA. Holy Shit. Interfering with your partners work is borderline abusive. Divorce and take everything.", "That\u2019s exactly the problem. He didn\u2019t do anything. He allowed his family to visit despite knowing his wife had an important meeting.

Divorce seems a bit much, unless he routinely does this. But obviously he didn't stand up to his brother and didn't do anything to help, and that's pretty shitty.", "Everyone is AH. You should have said no and stuck to it. Your husband is an AH for not respecting you or your job. Your in laws are AH for coming over when they know you both are working and not parenting their child.", "Seems pretty fake. It\u2019s a work day\u2026.why weren\u2019t your in laws working?

Why were their kids not in school?", "ESH, your husband should have cancelled the visit, and you could have handled it better.", "Esh \n\nIt was probably quite annoying and yes, he should grow a pair and tell his family no. \n\nBut you \u201cletting loose\u201d with insults, going to your parents house and thinking of divorce is a very extreme reaction", "ESH. Husband should have ensured the fam didn't behave as they did, but name calling and wanting a divorce is overboard unless there's something else you haven't divulged. If that's all it takes for you to use abusive language and think about a divorce, I'd be happy to see you go were I in husband's position.", "YTA.  You took it too far when you snapped.  Now you\u2019re talking divorce over this one incident?  If so, there\u2019s something wrong with you.  If not, and there\u2019s a history of having a bad marriage then you need to figure that out but YTA in this situation due to your abusive over reaction.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
