This went on for a couple months through the engagement. After one phone argument, I was so angry and hurt that I didn't even have the words to say goodbye, so I just hung up on him. I deliberated about whether or not to invite him and his wife to the wedding, but decided that it was petty to withhold an invitation. I mailed it to them, but it came back because I didn't have their correct address, so I stopped by their place to drop off the invitation personally.\n\nMy brother texted me about 20 minutes after I left and asked if we could get some lunch together, which we did the next day and he started the conversation by telling me how I'd hurt his feelings in the past couple months, including hanging up on him. I agreed that I had acted badly and apologized for everything. He said that he hadn't expected me to apologize. He was just going to lay out his side and demand an apology, which I was going to refuse to give and then he was going to walk out and leave me there alone. Instead, we had a big clearing the air conversation over lunch and parted ways in a very good place. With him saying he missed me and sharing a big bear hug. As I pulled out of the parking lot, I saw him sitting in his car on his phone.\n\nOn the drive home, my phone chimed a couple notifications and when I got home and checked it, my brother had texted me. It was an angry text with a demand that I apologize to his wife for three things.\n1. Hanging up on him.\n2. Showing up unannounced at their condo. Since SIL's own family wasn't allowed to come over without calling first. And this was the second time I had done this. (The first time was to drop off a birthday card for him.)\n3. Calling her drama.\nAnd that if I didn't apologize to her, my brother was cutting me out of his life for good and I would not be allowed to have anything to do with them again.\n\nSo I responded to this apology demand saying that I absolutely WOULD apologize to her for showing up unannounced, because even though we had grown up with an open door to family policy, I only wish they had communicated how they felt about this earlier. However, I refused to apologize to her for hanging up on my own brother because it was between me and him and I had apologized to him and that should have been enough for her. I also refused to apologize for calling her drama, because if he brought her into the conversation, it was his responsibility to clear up any misunderstanding.\n\nHis response was \"Bye Felicia.\"", "created_utc": 1678390174, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11n1a2v/aita_for_refusing_to_apologize_to_my_sil/", "score": 289, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I believe your refusal for not offering an apology for her being \u201cdrama\u201d speaks for itself when she/brother demanded one. Sadly, our loved ones can be completely manipulated by their significant other and believe they\u2019re acting chivalrous when blindly defending them without any real and legitimate reason(s). They will unfortunately learn the hard way that instead of alienating those family members who disagree with them will only leave them alone in the end. They\u2019ll become completely dependent upon their significant other which will make them feel more alone than ever because they know you have no one else to turn to for support.

Weddings are stressful, and have an unfortunate tendency to bring out the worst in people involved. It's a tale as old as time. Lots of people have stories about the friend/family/loved one who they are no longer speaking to as a result of bad behavior leading up to and/or during the wedding. Judging from this (very one-sided, I should add) description of the situation, this sounds salvageable to me. You just need to get over your pride.

As you mentioned, they should have clarified their preference not to have unannounced guests prior to getting upset with you. That's not fair. And it was really an AH move on your brother's part to suggest lunch with the intention of using it as an opportunity to blow up at you and cause more drama. \n\nAlso - \"Bye Felicia\"? What is this, 2016????\n\nIt sounds to me like there is crappy behavior on both sides. It would be far better to let it go and try to forge a path forward than holding on to it at this point.

To that end, I think it's generally good advice, without getting hung up on the specifics of this question, to break out of the mindset of who has done what and therefore \"deserves\" or \"owes\" an apology. Life is not that black and white. Life is not something you can approach like an accountant.

Given that these event happened years ago, some of this advice isn't going to work. I was operating under the assumption that this was an ongoing issue, not one which has been resolved. I'm still going to post this response, but I think it's a little misleading to frame this question as if it's happening now, not 5 years ago.
