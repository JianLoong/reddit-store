My sister in law got married 3 months ago and had a celebration lunch 2 weeks after. There we met her new in-laws, but we never connected or exchanged more than \u2018hello, how are you, good bye\u2019. So they\u2019re practically strangers. They didn\u2019t interact at all with my kid.\n\nNow comes my kid\u2019s birthday and my sister in law says that her in-laws will be in town so they would come to the birthday lunch as well. I didn\u2019t feel like having strangers in the house for that special day, my kid didn\u2019t want them around so I told my sister in law that she and her husband are welcome to come but her in-laws can find something else to do for 3 hours.\n\nSo here\u2019s what my sister in law decided to do. She came and brought over her son, left him for the day to spend time and play with my kid. Then she said to her mom and her brother (not my husband)to join her, her husband and her in-laws for a morning coffee. The morning coffee turned into lunch, which turned into no one showing up for my kid. Around 5 pm I tell my husband to call her and tell her to pick up her kid, I was done babysitting him.\n\nShe comes(alone) and sees we didn\u2019t cut the cake so she says come on, let\u2019s sing and cut it. My kid didn\u2019t want to, she wanted to leave it for later to do it just with her dad and me. The sister in law kept at it, her son said he wants to try the cake so reluctantly we sang \u2018happy birthday\u2019 and we cut it. They had a slice and left (I also gave them a piece of cake to take with them for the in-laws).\n\nMy husband and I decided to do at least something special for the day(I won\u2019t say how sad my girl was) so we went bowling (first time for my kid). While in the car, my brother in law send me a message saying that after the outing he had he was sleepy and went to bed and now he is up and wants to come over to give the gift to my kid. I tell him we\u2019re not home. While we\u2019re bowling, my mother in law calls my husband (it was around 7pm by now) and says she wants to pass by to give my husband a sweet she had prepared. I blow up and tell my husband no one is welcomed anymore, we\u2019ll go home and rest so we can be up for the New Year\u2019s fireworks.\n\nSo, long story short, because I didn\u2019t invite the in-laws of my sister in law to my kid\u2019s birthday party, no one showed up. Cherry on the cake is that I\u2019ve been told that I\u2019m the a\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* for making my sister in law choose between my kid and her in-laws. Or for not celebrating the birthday another day.\n\nSo, who\u2019s the a\\*\\*\\*\\* here? Also, for the past 4 days my sister in law keeps on asking to meet(which she never did before), which I gently refuse cause I\u2019m not ready to see her yet.

NO means NO end of.\n\nYour NTA for not inviting perfect strangers to a 7year olds birthday, your SIL sucks for being such a pathetic brat and knowingly inviting everyone for coffee on your child's birthday. Your husband needs to talk to his family and tell them that how they treated your daughter was horrible and frankly pathetic and they should apologise, but don't expect one to come.", "NTA\n\nAnyone who blew off my kids' birthday party would be someone I didn't speak to for months. They showed that your kid is at the bottom of their priorities, so they are now at the bottom of yours. They don't get to come over, they don't get to blame you for their cruelty, and they don't get to act like they didn't do this to your child because they wanted to punish you. And people who hurt children to punish their parents are monsters who shouldn't be around the child they just hurt.", "NTA ur husband should address the issue.
