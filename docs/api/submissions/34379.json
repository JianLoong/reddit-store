My sister in law got married 3 months ago and had a celebration lunch 2 weeks after. There we met her new in-laws, but we never connected or exchanged more than \u2018hello, how are you, good bye\u2019. So they\u2019re practically strangers. They didn\u2019t interact at all with my kid.\n\nNow comes my kid\u2019s birthday and my sister in law says that her in-laws will be in town so they would come to the birthday lunch as well. I didn\u2019t feel like having strangers in the house for that special day, my kid didn\u2019t want them around so I told my sister in law that she and her husband are welcome to come but her in-laws can find something else to do for 3 hours.\n\nSo here\u2019s what my sister in law decided to do. She came and brought over her son, left him for the day to spend time and play with my kid. Then she said to her mom and her brother (not my husband)to join her, her husband and her in-laws for a morning coffee. The morning coffee turned into lunch, which turned into no one showing up for my kid. Around 5 pm I tell my husband to call her and tell her to pick up her kid, I was done babysitting him.\n\nShe comes(alone) and sees we didn\u2019t cut the cake so she says come on, let\u2019s sing and cut it. My kid didn\u2019t want to, she wanted to leave it for later to do it just with her dad and me. The sister in law kept at it, her son said he wants to try the cake so reluctantly we sang \u2018happy birthday\u2019 and we cut it. They had a slice and left (I also gave them a piece of cake to take with them for the in-laws).\n\nMy husband and I decided to do at least something special for the day(I won\u2019t say how sad my girl was) so we went bowling (first time for my kid). While in the car, my brother in law send me a message saying that after the outing he had he was sleepy and went to bed and now he is up and wants to come over to give the gift to my kid. I tell him we\u2019re not home. While we\u2019re bowling, my mother in law calls my husband (it was around 7pm by now) and says she wants to pass by to give my husband a sweet she had prepared. I blow up and tell my husband no one is welcomed anymore, we\u2019ll go home and rest so we can be up for the New Year\u2019s fireworks.\n\nSo, long story short, because I didn\u2019t invite the in-laws of my sister in law to my kid\u2019s birthday party, no one showed up. Cherry on the cake is that I\u2019ve been told that I\u2019m the a\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* for making my sister in law choose between my kid and her in-laws. Or for not celebrating the birthday another day.\n\nSo, who\u2019s the a\\*\\*\\*\\* here?

This might seem a small thing but to a CHILD it will not be and should never be shown as acceptable because all you do is then show your child they did something wrong and don't deserve to be loved. That even if you say you did something, they don't love them anyway because they were the ones made to suffer. This can and will affect your entire child's outlook on life and relationships. Can and will set them up to expect this to be normal and get into an abusive relationship because this is all they know. How many posts have you read on here.

You could invite them along to some things but not have a high expectation that they come so if they do its a bonus (as long as they don't act entitled) but if they don't, it's no skin off anyone's nose.", "I had to scroll all the way to the end to see someone asking the same question I had- why the hell would you not just let the visiting relatives come to the party. Yes, I realize they are only tangentially related to you but what kind of example does it set?  In my home, and at all of my gatherings extra people are always welcome. Two people I had never met were here for thanksgiving. If you act hurt and put out about petty things, your kids will be the same. IMO you ruined your own kids birthday by being exclusionary rather than welcoming. You are teaching your daughter that\u2019s the right way to be. Everyone else was acting like petty assholes too, no doubt, but think about what kind of person you want your kid to be. Show generosity. Show flexibility. Show how to rise above the petty antics of the other family members. You will be rewarded with a child who isn\u2019t petty, rigid and self centered, but open and. compassionate.", "[deleted]", "I\u2019m just curious how awful it would have been to just include two more people?  Are they just awful people or rude or mean to your child?  Would it have made that much difference?  It would have been the easiest solution and polite so wonder what was behind it?  Kinda ESH at this point.", "What kind of person was you FIL? Would he have been ok with his wife and kids being cruel to his grandchild on their birthday just to please some grown adults? If he was a good guy, I\u2019d ask exactly that question to MIL. Regardless, MIL & SIL both need a time out. I\u2019d let them know you\u2019ll be taking a two month break from them so you can readjust your expectations to this newly revealed viscous streak of theirs, that is ok with using children as weapons. You\u2019ll contact them again after & see if you can rebuild the relationship under these new expectations.", "All I hear is you continuing to defend those who were CALCULATED and CRUEL to your daughter. Your daughter didn\u2019t want to cut the cake because she was rightfully hurt and upset. Did you do what she wanted? Or were someone else\u2019s feelings more important. Oh, that\u2019s right! You did put your nephew before your daughter.  SMH \n \nEVERYTHING your SIL did was CALCULATED right down to cutting the cake even when everyone knew your daughter was hurt. Your Nephew is not the birthday boy nor were his feelings crushed. YOU need to be better for your daughter. If your husband has such a WEAK BACKBONE that he accepted that total BS of an excuse from his mother, YOU have to SPEAK UP and make sure he\u2019s not putting his mother\u2019s feelings before his immediate family (YOU and DAUGHTER). If you continue to allow these people to be in your daughter\u2019s life and nothing changes, she\u2019s going to move to the other end of the country to get away from ALL OF YOU. I\u2019m speaking from first-hand experience here. DO BETTER. Stern words to the family is a slap on the wrist for something so cruel. AT LEAST go NC with the SIL. She\u2019s SO TOXIC. It will be all YOUR FAULT if you continue to allow this behavior. I know it\u2019s your husband\u2019s family, but he\u2019s already shown he\u2019s SOFT.", "I wouldn\u2019t hold the grudge the above poster is suggesting but I definitely wouldn\u2019t have her around until she\u2019s willing to own up to what she did. Same with your MIL. And the person they owe the apology to is your daughter, not you. If they can\u2019t do that then why would they be welcome in any capacity other than what is comfortable for your daughter?\n\nThe only concern I actually have outside of your daughter is for your nephew. If there weren\u2019t other children involved it would be very easy to tell SIL to gtfo. \n\nDefinitely go see your family next year.", "It wasn\u2019t so much that cutting the cake would be rude to her cousin. Your SIL forced the party to be canceled and therefore would have deprived her son of cake. That\u2019s how it should be interpreted.", "Why would you want strangers at your daughters birthday party?", "May I ask why?  \n\nI would NEVER assume I can crash a party that involved my SIL's family because they are HER family.  And while, yes, you are supposed to be congenial and what not to extended family across the aisle as it were, that does NOT include this kind of invitation.", "Exactly that. I saw no good exit in the given situation and chose to not hurt another child as well, knowing that it wouldn\u2019t fix my child\u2019s pain. But yes, I showed my child that I\u2019m a people pleaser - something I knew but it was never over my daughter\u2019s feelings. So yes, there\u2019s work to be done here.", "And now that you know, I would limit the interaction for the benefit of your child.  When SIL pops out a baby, her kid will be favored over yours because they are the golden grandbaby. And FWIW, your kids will know.  \n\nBelieve me, mine did.", "That's the part that really bugs me.  So SIL's in-laws are in town, and the only one of her nuclear family she leaves out is her son, aka her new husband's stepson.  Like...if a family visit was so important, why did she ditch her own kid?", "Oh please, you weren\u2019t in shock. You don\u2019t know how to enforce boundaries yet. You should learn.", "But do you realize that you did the same thing that your MIL did? You felt bad about someone else so you put that other person above your daughter. Your MIL thought that she had to be welcoming to her new in-law's so she also put them above your daughter.\n\nI'm not saying this to make you feel bad about yourself, but I saw you downplaying your people-pleasing tendencies in another comment by saying \"but it's so hard to change\" and it made me a bit mad because I feel really sorry for your daughter.\n\nSo I hope this situation was enough for you to open your eyes and decide to work hard on yourself for your daughter's sake, otherwise her heartbreak was for nothing and you'll be kind of a hypocrite for judging your MIL but acting just like her.", "Did the sister force her mother at gunpoint ?", "Your husband sucks.", "Omg SIL is vile! Narcissist doesn\u2019t even begin to describe her! If she purposely took all those petty nasty actions to deliberately ruin a child\u2019s party, I can\u2019t even imagine what spiteful maneuvering she\u2019ll do in the future when he nose gets out of joint again. \n\nYou know not to watch her child again, right? Have excuses ready!", "There's already a son by the golden SIL.....", "Which is going to imply that when she has a baby with her new husband that that kid (and the subsequent ones) will be the golden children and her eldest child will be relegated to the 'not real family' pile.  Poor kid.", "And your KID.", "I understand that, but you send the message, then, that your relationship with your in-laws is more important than your daughter's well-being and her sense of being valued.  Unlike you, she doesn't choose this relationship where your in-laws don't even have the good sense to to excuse themselves after a few hours of morning tea to celebrate their granddaughter.  I mean, how many hours do your in-laws really need to talk to their daughter's in-laws?  Is someone dying?", "What was their response? Did they apologize with a promise to do better? Or was it all just excuses for their poor behavior?", "My sons birthday is also on NYE and just turned 8 and we have a family party on the day and every year they come. Its not to much to ask for an hour during the day for some cake.", "Yup, OP was just the babysitter for the day.", "I feel for the nephew as well. By the looks of things, he was shunted to OPs so SIL and FAMILY could meet up with the new family. What the fuck is nephew? Chopped liver?", "Yes please do. It's so sad for the kids when people can't attend because they are away during the festive season, let alone family wilfully choosing other events over their birthday celebrations.", "Just keep the party just for her friends. No in laws!!!  What is your husband's response to all of this?", "I'd suggest doing it the weekend after her birthday when folks are back in town.  The last day of school can sometimes be lightly attended, especially in the early grades, as families leave early for the holidays.  There's also just a LOT happening that week before Christmas.", "I think the vile thing here is they hurt your child not to offend in-laws of in-laws. They played games just to spite you through your child. Your daughter did nothing wrong. All was adult decisions. Your in laws showed utter disregard to your daughter which was visible with cake cutting.", "This is exactly what I always wanted to avoid - her friends not being able to show up so that\u2019s why we made a tradition each year to celebrate at lunchtime with family. I never could have imagined them not showing up.", "This here.  OP\u2019s MIL chose her daughter\u2019s in-laws over her prior commitment to her granddaughter because \u201cthey are family?!\u201d  OP, you\u2019ve been told your daughter has less \u201cfamily\u201d standing than SIL\u2019s in-laws.  What more do you need to know?", "\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f"]}
