Instead of biology he will say biOH-Lojjy. Philosophy he will say fillow-soffy. For years I\u2019ve told him it annoys me but he says no the root word is bio and philo so it should be pronounced like he does, not like all of academia does.\n\nI was telling him about a friend at work and he changed the pronunciation of that name to its \u201ccorrect\u201d form. From VJ to \u201cvih-jaye\u201d. I said that\u2019s not his name and he said yes it is, he must be using a nickname at work.\n\nHe pronounces the word bikini as Biggini. I told him I particularly hate this and he insists that it\u2019s correct in his accent and I told him his accent isn\u2019t in any other words but he just doubles down and refuses to budge and says I should just deal with it.\n\nIt\u2019s been 5 years. It\u2019s become so that if I get frustrated he will say he\u2019s hurt by my reaction rather than change how he pronounces basic things. He always defends in two ways 1) the rest of the world is wrong and he is right 2) it\u2019s hurtful that I\u2019m annoyed.\n\nI might be the asshole here- I lost my shit today and called him a controlling piece of shit for refusing to acknowledging that someone\u2019s NAME can be the way they pronounce it and not what he thinks is right or regional and he said he\u2019s hurt and is huffy. He says I have temper issues.\n\nHe does this about everything like he won\u2019t close the lid of the toilet when he flushed because he doesn\u2019t believe particles fly everywhere\u2019s and won\u2019t believe the research.  \n\nAm I overthinking it?? Am I being insane?\n\nEDIT: Every comment is mentioning breaking up.  I\u2019m not gonna break up over pronunciation obviously, just looking for perspective\n\nEDIT 2: we both have the same country, race and accent. English is our second language but we are natively fluent\n\nEDIT 3: there are now way too many comments for me to ever read so I am abandoning this post. But thanks so much for your emotional labor,  insights, and shared frustration of mispronunciation. I\u2019ve opted to apologize to my boyfriend and will try to be less frustrated even if he chooses to mispronounce things, because it\u2019s not a worthy subject to fight over, and because he is considerate of almost all my other needs. \n\nI will remind him to be more flexible in a relationship and remind myself to let small things not snowball. **Getting him to pronounce bikini right IS a hill I will die on unfortunately**, but biology can go to hell I guess.

There is an objectively right way to say it in Chinese and what I actually think it is, vs. what many people might pronounce it as. If I heard someone else pronounce my last name I'd probably be like \"oh it's Xiang, not Zang\" (referring to a different person). A lot of people with foreign names navigate the same thing. Similarly, I use a culturally French name as my Western name and it tends to be anglicised (think Vivienne -> Vivian).
