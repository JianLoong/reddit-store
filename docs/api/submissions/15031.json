We are getting by alright, but we are in no way wealthy, just better off than most. I take care of most of the finances for us because Sam doesn't like to talk about money. Every time I try to bring up our finances, Sam shuts down or she gets easily agitated. She is like this because her family used to fight over money a lot and she doesn't want that for us. As a result, I have to watch our finances and it's hard because she doesn't want to communicate this with me.\n\nI've been managing our finances and I've noticed that we haven't been able to save as much as we'd like (we are saving for a trip in Florida). We have an outstanding bill that needs to be paid (the internet) and that will put us back a bit, but not by a heck of a whole lot.\n\nSam invited her coworkers over to our house yesterday while I was out with my family. One of her coworkers (Daniella) was also there. Daniella's boyfriend passed away recently and she has been struggling to take care of her and her kids. Sam decided to give Daniella $110 as she felt bad for her situation.\n\nI came home a few hours after everyone left and Sam told me what she did. Sam thought I would've been very proud of her but I was furious and she could see it. I tried very hard not to lose my temper, but then Sam said \"it is my money and it's my money to give\" this really set me off and I said \"excuse me, but this is, our money. We pooled our expenses together. I don't mind it if you gave her some of our coupons, a $20 or some of the gift cards we have, but $110, what the fuck is wrong with you?!\" Sam explained that $110 wasn't a lot of money and that's when I told her that because of her action, we are no longer saving money. She then got mad going into different directions and she said things like: money isn't that important; well if you only worked in a better job; ask your family for money.\n\nSam left for her parents place. She's tried calling me a few times this morning, but truthfullyI don't have it in me right now to talk to her without being mad. Am I wrong though? I understand she was trying to do the right thing, but what really upsets me about this is that she didn't even talk to me about this before giving Daniella the $110. It makes me feel like she doesn't see me as a partner.\n\nEdit: I realize I didn't add this in and I apologize. The money came from our joint account.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: This has gotten a lot of replies and I appreciate everyone taking the time to write their opinions.

I suggest the latter since she's usually unwilling to communicate about finances.", "ESH. Your reaction is the problem. It was too much. Swearing at her and yelling was not okay.

You two are on completely different pages in two completely different books. \n\nAnd that's exactly how you both need to handle this topic: separately. Stop pooling. Have separate accounts. Split the bills. You handle your obligations your way, and she will handle hers her way.  If you guys can't get THAT to work for you two, then you guys shouldn't be living together. \n\nYou both owe each other an apology.

Telling her WTF were you thinking is not the correct way to respond to this. Maybe what she did was irresponsible but it shows me that she has a big heart, something you don't seem to have.

You are doing too much over 110 dollars when you yourself said you guys are doing OK. Sam tho also sucks for her unwillingness to discuss these things.

Make clear arrangements about who pays for what so you can decide what you do with your remaining money. \n\nShe decided to give a friend who just lost a partner some money to help them along; I think that\u2019s pretty nice and considering her financial past, I\u2019d assume that was a big step for her (maybe not and actually quite unimportant to this thread). Considering you\u2019re saving for a trip, this probably seemed more of a \u201cnet good\u201d to her.\n\nShe got triggered, but that\u2019s on her.

The amount of money means nothing, because everyone makes different amounts and values money differently...but she doesn't put value on money like you do, and since you've never talked about it (granted, because she doesn't want to) you have different expectations for what the money means. I wouldn't spend money out of a joint account without talking to my wife if we had never discussed what that account was for, but when it comes to **moral things** I'd also never think twice about giving money away from our joint account as long as it were something that I knew my wife would be OK with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut that's just it - you two aren't connected.

Another option is you figure out a time every week, or every month, to go over your budget and talk about money. Not you lecturing her or yelling at her, but tracking the money going in and out of your account. Try just 20-30 minutes, focused on the issue, and then close the page on it whether you're done or not. It's like money exposure therapy.

Would OP have agreed to give Daniella a generous sum if Sam had asked first? Considering how upset he got over not being able to save toward the Florida trip, I suspect not. This may be why Sam is so hesitant to discuss financial matters with him. She's moved by human matters, he's moved by material ones.

And it's definitely a bad sign that he's THIS angry over such a small sum that wasn't earmarked for anything critical.\n\nAs a side note, I would also consider a friend and their kids not starving to death more important than saving for a luxury like a holiday.

And in this day and age it really doesn't take much to be better than most. Most people don't even have $400 in savings. So if you have $400 in savings and 400 in the account you're already doing better the most. But it doesn't mean you got money to give. And I'm not going to lie I or my wife would be incredibly mad if either one of us just give $110 out of our bank account without asking the other person. Help my wife and I call each other for making $100 purchase that's outside of our normal purchases. It's a joint bank account it's both of our Monies. Me or my wife would absolutely be yelling at the other for doing something so blatantly disrespectful to the other.

Leaving someone else to handle all the finances and not wanting to talk about when they have managed some balancing act, and then being callous about it saying \"it's my money that I gave away, get a better job or borrow from your parents\" when you have a joint account is not mature behavior.

He's completely justified in getting angry. He's explained he's tried various times to communicate with her about it. But she just completely refuses to. So he's stressed about how to continue, and instead of asking him for his opinion or including him in her decision. She chose to just make a decision about THEIR finances on her own. He's completely right in getting angry that way. She's been completely uncooperative, and he's right for him to feel as though she doesn't see him as a partner. It doesn't seem like it.

Have income come to 1 account, put some in a savings account for emergencies, and each partner gets equal spending money based on the surplus after paying off expenses like the credit card they use for groceries or have a budget for household expenses (although that can lead to fights on what's an individual vs household expense).", "Uhh my finances are combined and my fianc\u00e9e would NOT need to run something like this by me.

He can\u2019t talk to her about finances like an adult, she doesn\u2019t care to be informed about finances, they\u2019re behind on bills which negatively impacts their financial future, and then she goes and makes a financial decision which impacts the both of them without consulting him and then says it\u2019s her money. Well if it\u2019s her money why isn\u2019t she informing herself on what that money is supposed to go towards? Then when he loses his shit she suddenly questions his job and tells him to borrow money.\n\nShe refuses to take accountability on multiple occasions and it seems like it would be emotionally draining to have to deal with that. \n\nI see at least like 10 red flags there alone. Losing his temper like that is not cool but how else do you communicate to someone who actively refuses to take part in that type of conversation.\n\nDo you see how the whole situation could just fuck with a person mentally? Im curious since you want to label everyone as abusive\u2026 what\u2019s your ideal response to that situation? I\u2019m genuinely curious. No hate or beef.  \n\nTake into account she refuses to take part in discussions and decisions about long term finances and has a weird individualistic mindset about how she spends money when it impacts both of them", "if the roles were reversed, I'd 100% believe you'd be saying this was financial abuse on his part and her still seething about what he did is 100% justified."]}
