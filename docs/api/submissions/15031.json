We are getting by alright, but we are in no way wealthy, just better off than most. I take care of most of the finances for us because Sam doesn't like to talk about money. Every time I try to bring up our finances, Sam shuts down or she gets easily agitated. She is like this because her family used to fight over money a lot and she doesn't want that for us. As a result, I have to watch our finances and it's hard because she doesn't want to communicate this with me.\n\nI've been managing our finances and I've noticed that we haven't been able to save as much as we'd like (we are saving for a trip in Florida). We have an outstanding bill that needs to be paid (the internet) and that will put us back a bit, but not by a heck of a whole lot.\n\nSam invited her coworkers over to our house yesterday while I was out with my family. One of her coworkers (Daniella) was also there. Daniella's boyfriend passed away recently and she has been struggling to take care of her and her kids. Sam decided to give Daniella $110 as she felt bad for her situation.\n\nI came home a few hours after everyone left and Sam told me what she did. Sam thought I would've been very proud of her but I was furious and she could see it. I tried very hard not to lose my temper, but then Sam said \"it is my money and it's my money to give\" this really set me off and I said \"excuse me, but this is, our money. We pooled our expenses together. I don't mind it if you gave her some of our coupons, a $20 or some of the gift cards we have, but $110, what the fuck is wrong with you?!\" Sam explained that $110 wasn't a lot of money and that's when I told her that because of her action, we are no longer saving money. She then got mad going into different directions and she said things like: money isn't that important; well if you only worked in a better job; ask your family for money.\n\nSam left for her parents place. She's tried calling me a few times this morning, but truthfullyI don't have it in me right now to talk to her without being mad. Am I wrong though? I understand she was trying to do the right thing, but what really upsets me about this is that she didn't even talk to me about this before giving Daniella the $110. It makes me feel like she doesn't see me as a partner.\n\nEdit: I realize I didn't add this in and I apologize. The money came from our joint account.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: This has gotten a lot of replies and I appreciate everyone taking the time to write their opinions.

I suggest the latter since she's usually unwilling to communicate about finances.", "ESH. Your reaction is the problem. It was too much. Swearing at her and yelling was not okay.

If they had separate accounts, then yes it's her money, bit with a joint account - mine is now ours. \nOP since you have a joint account, maybe establish a limit of how much either of you can spend without discussing with the other.

You two are on completely different pages in two completely different books. \n\nAnd that's exactly how you both need to handle this topic: separately. Stop pooling. Have separate accounts. Split the bills. You handle your obligations your way, and she will handle hers her way.  If you guys can't get THAT to work for you two, then you guys shouldn't be living together. \n\nYou both owe each other an apology.

Telling her WTF were you thinking is not the correct way to respond to this. Maybe what she did was irresponsible but it shows me that she has a big heart, something you don't seem to have.

You are doing too much over 110 dollars when you yourself said you guys are doing OK. Sam tho also sucks for her unwillingness to discuss these things.

Make clear arrangements about who pays for what so you can decide what you do with your remaining money. \n\nShe decided to give a friend who just lost a partner some money to help them along; I think that\u2019s pretty nice and considering her financial past, I\u2019d assume that was a big step for her (maybe not and actually quite unimportant to this thread). Considering you\u2019re saving for a trip, this probably seemed more of a \u201cnet good\u201d to her.\n\nShe got triggered, but that\u2019s on her.

Sure, okay, that tracks.", "Yeah. I have dated a girl like her and I get where op is coming from.   It\u2019s easy to say \u2018you should talk about it\u2019 but some people really do shut down so much it\u2019s impossible.  They really stick their head in the sand and even if you \u2018talk\u2019, it\u2019s in one ear and out the other.   God I feel for op cause she is being super irresponsible.

He didn\u2019t have a measured convo about his concern or his feelings that she is being irresponsible financially, etc. he immediately exploded at her. \n\nI\u2019ve seen this countless times, OP is playing the victim and being indignant and self righteous about what she said, while completely minimizing and almost assuredly leaving out some ugly shit he said.", "Plus, the later \"explanation\" that \"$110 wasn't a lot of money\" adds to it the very reasonable concern that this could be a recurring thing, not a one time thing. It'd be one thing if she acknowledged it as a lot of money, and said that it was only because of the seriousness of the other person's situation, but the approach she took instead means it wouldn't be at all surprising to see her buy things for a similar amount or give away a similar amount without much thought in the future. \n\nThis isn't just about the direct $110, it's about the entire attitude to do with spending and money, and is a *huge* incompatibility in the relationship if they can't get it resolved.\n\nAnd yes, she's right: financial issues are a huge source of relationship strife and breakups/divorces, but the solution to that isn't to just refuse to discuss it at all.\n\nI'm heavily leaning NTA here.", "Depends on your perspective of \"afford\". To Sam, it seems they could afford it because they had at least that much in their account. To OP, they can't afford it because that amount stopped their savings. \n\nThe deeper issue for me is that Sam refused to share until now that this is how she views finances because she refuses to talk about it and makes OP be in charge of all finances. I do agree that since she defacto put OP in charge, there's really no scenario she should have given away money without conferring with OP first on if they could afford it.", "But they *could* afford it. The $110 Sam gave away was the money they were going to save that month toward their Florida trip, according to OP.

And spending money stays in their own account.\n\nWith them figuring out the best way for the two of them to handle things like groceries and household expenses.", "I don't know what he means by well off, but elsewhere, he said that she took $110 from their joint account, and they have $60 left.  I'd raise an eyebrow if my partner gave someone money from a joint account, but if they gave someone over half of the money in our joint account, I'd probably be shaking, myself.

If you continued talking after she did that, she'd start scream-sobbing at you about how you're abusing her and bullying her and why are you screaming she did nothing wrong even if you were speaking in a totally normal tone of voice.\n\nThere's a reason she's lost contact with almost everyone that she had been friends with at some point and it's because inevitably she'd do something and that would happen again.\n\n\"Talking it out\" only works if both parties are approaching the topic in good faith, unfortunately, so often the people who need it most are completely immune to it.", "Have you considered a career in writing fiction?
