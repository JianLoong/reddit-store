We are getting by alright, but we are in no way wealthy, just better off than most. I take care of most of the finances for us because Sam doesn't like to talk about money. Every time I try to bring up our finances, Sam shuts down or she gets easily agitated. She is like this because her family used to fight over money a lot and she doesn't want that for us. As a result, I have to watch our finances and it's hard because she doesn't want to communicate this with me.\n\nI've been managing our finances and I've noticed that we haven't been able to save as much as we'd like (we are saving for a trip in Florida). We have an outstanding bill that needs to be paid (the internet) and that will put us back a bit, but not by a heck of a whole lot.\n\nSam invited her coworkers over to our house yesterday while I was out with my family. One of her coworkers (Daniella) was also there. Daniella's boyfriend passed away recently and she has been struggling to take care of her and her kids. Sam decided to give Daniella $110 as she felt bad for her situation.\n\nI came home a few hours after everyone left and Sam told me what she did. Sam thought I would've been very proud of her but I was furious and she could see it. I tried very hard not to lose my temper, but then Sam said \"it is my money and it's my money to give\" this really set me off and I said \"excuse me, but this is, our money. We pooled our expenses together. I don't mind it if you gave her some of our coupons, a $20 or some of the gift cards we have, but $110, what the fuck is wrong with you?!\" Sam explained that $110 wasn't a lot of money and that's when I told her that because of her action, we are no longer saving money. She then got mad going into different directions and she said things like: money isn't that important; well if you only worked in a better job; ask your family for money.\n\nSam left for her parents place. She's tried calling me a few times this morning, but truthfullyI don't have it in me right now to talk to her without being mad. Am I wrong though? I understand she was trying to do the right thing, but what really upsets me about this is that she didn't even talk to me about this before giving Daniella the $110. It makes me feel like she doesn't see me as a partner.\n\nEdit: I realize I didn't add this in and I apologize. The money came from our joint account.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: This has gotten a lot of replies and I appreciate everyone taking the time to write their opinions. I will look into updating after I've spoken with Sam tonight.", "created_utc": 1681745037, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pl6m7/aita_for_shouting_at_my_girlfriend_for_giving/", "score": 142, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even for a donation, if the amount is large enough to dip into your savings that should be a joint decision.

Reason being my gf didn\u2019t earn any money at that time (student without student loan) and the thought of budgeting my money made her stress out.

Yes, she was trying to do a kind thing but joint decisions matter when you have joint finances. \n\nYour feelings about it are valid, but the way you reacted and spoke to her wasn't cool and quite frankly, is toxic. Communicate how you feel without indicating that there's something wrong with her. Set expectations and boundaries regarding money and spending, or choose to revert back to non-combined finances. I suggest the latter since she's usually unwilling to communicate about finances.", "ESH. Your reaction is the problem. It was too much. Swearing at her and yelling was not okay.  But, she should have asked. She has to learn to communicate about money. You are both in the wrong.", "Esh\n\nShe is the way she is.  If you dont like it dont date her.

That way she has her own money that she can give to whoever without a fight between you guys.", "NTA but you should separate your finances.

I would recommend seeing a couples counselor to help assist with this.", "I see you both at issue here: 1. OP losing it that he is yelling and shaking in anger is not good. That loss of control is something to think about. \n2. GF not talking about finances is not helpful, or productive. And I speak from experience. My anxiety makes it hard for me to sit down and work on budgets with my husband, but therapy has helped. \n3. If they had separate accounts, then yes it's her money, bit with a joint account - mine is now ours. \nOP since you have a joint account, maybe establish a limit of how much either of you can spend without discussing with the other. But you need to keep calm.", "ESH. But this is what happens when you don't communicate about something as important as money.Willy-nilly spending is the proverbial opposite to any fixed budget that has goals. You two are about are about as opposite as it gets: you believing in the importance of fiscal responsibility and goals,  and your gf thinks money isn't important. You two are on completely different pages in two completely different books. \n\nAnd that's exactly how you both need to handle this topic: separately. Stop pooling. Have separate accounts. Split the bills. You handle your obligations your way, and she will handle hers her way.  If you guys can't get THAT to work for you two, then you guys shouldn't be living together. \n\nYou both owe each other an apology. But your anger runs deeper than this incident, and that's something you probably need to sort out.", "ESH for the way you reacted. Telling her WTF were you thinking is not the correct way to respond to this. Maybe what she did was irresponsible but it shows me that she has a big heart, something you don't seem to have. If this becomes a pattern then you should address it, but I think you overreacted in this case.", "You sound like you lost your cool. YTA", "Esh. You are doing too much over 110 dollars when you yourself said you guys are doing OK. Sam tho also sucks for her unwillingness to discuss these things. Instead of being a rational adult she's letting history repeat itself and allowing finances to interfere like they did with her parents. I wonder if your anger stems more from her refusal  to step up than her giving money tbh.", "You\u2019re both assholes here. \n\nI empathize with her about having trouble talking about finances, but that is crucial to a functioning relationship- especially when you\u2019re pooling your money together. I suggest you move away from that if you plan to stay together and want to avoid financial strife like that. Make clear arrangements about who pays for what so you can decide what you do with your remaining money. \n\nShe decided to give a friend who just lost a partner some money to help them along; I think that\u2019s pretty nice and considering her financial past, I\u2019d assume that was a big step for her (maybe not and actually quite unimportant to this thread). Considering you\u2019re saving for a trip, this probably seemed more of a \u201cnet good\u201d to her.\n\nShe got triggered, but that\u2019s on her. Putting blame on you and saying you need to work more/ ask family for money is out of line.", "I\u2019m going to break from the pack and say YTA.\n\nYou majorly overreacted. She very clearly has trauma around discussing finances and you went OFF on her. No wonder she doesn\u2019t want to talk to you about it. \n\nShould she have discussed it with you since she took it from a joint account? Absolutely. Is she irresponsible and terrible and an asshole for giving her friend who is struggling after the death of her husband $100? Absolutely not.\n\nGrow up and stop yelling at your girlfriend and shaking from anger. Everyone is different, but personally I would leave you for that alone. You\u2019re doing absolutely nothing to make her feel comfortable discussing finances with you, you\u2019re only confirming her trauma.", "You do all the budgeting but do you budget expendable - spend how you want - money?

I do think that if you guys are struggling she should mention it to you as something she is planning to do, but I still don't think a partner should have say in the other's personal money. Your girlfriend did a nice thing for someone in need.\n\nEDIT: After seeing your edit I go with NTA then since it was from the joint account.

Yeah, but keep in mind what it took for him to snap. Which is beyond what it takes most people. He kept his cool as long as possible\u2014 and he rightfully snapped after she pushed the right button.

Or is she planning on doing what a lot of people do and pretend to put out her resume when all she\u2019s really doing is sitting at home doing nothing and relying on you? Cause this one is extremely extremely common. \n- She told YOU to ask YOUR family for financial support, why can\u2019t she ask her own?\n\nOP, financials are one of the things that can and will break a relationship, and your girlfriend is *choosing* to break yours by being so flippant about money.

Finances need to be discussed in a relationship but she wants to hide her head in the sand. She doesnt want to talk about it because of her past but what she is doing is going to repeat it.
