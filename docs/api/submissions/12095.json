They need to get their address figured out and the carrier needs to know that the mail is going to the wrong place. Nothing will ever get fixed if you just keep handing the mail off to them.\n\nIf you aren't able to catch your carrrier in person, consider leaving a note inside the box saying \"Jones family only, Smith family no longer here.\" By now the carrier should know who lives where, but also they may assume you have some sort of side deal planned to take care of any wrong mail and are keeping it on purpose. If I don't get things back, I assume they were delivered correctly.", "If in the United States, on every piece of their mail write \"Not at this address\" and put it back in the mail. Let the post office deal with it. Your neighbors have had enough time to update their address. NTA", "I don\u2019t understand why this wasn\u2019t done right when the woman started being snarky.", "My childhood mailman has done this for me for years. My mom no longer owns our childhood home but my ex wife lives next door and my sister down the street. I have changed my address and updated my address most places but I still occasionally get an odd piece of mail to my moms old house or the exwife. When he sees that he delivers it to my sisters house down the street so she can give it to me, or if he sees me in the neighborhood he\u2019ll flag me down and hand it to me. He\u2019s been doing it for years", "In the US, that's a felony.", "We rotate between 2 where I live", "Thanks!", "Only if you do so in between when the sender puts the item in the mail and when the USPS puts it into a mailbox.  There are no obligations on the end recipient.", "Wrong.\n\nYou're not obligated to return to the post office, but it's a federal crime to destroy mail. You don't have to go out of your way to return it. You can keep it in a pile for the recipient or mark return to sender, but you can't throw it away.", "NTA. This is something to solve with your post office. Let them know the situation and that their mail should no longer be delivered to you. In your mailbox, put a sticky note that says mail for (your names) only. Don't let this woman run your life. Your husband is being unsupportive, because no one is asking him to do the mail delivery and insult collection.", "I had to move because of renovations being done to the place where I was living. It only changed my address by one number. And, the postal worker keeps putting my mail in my old mailbox that I no longer have access to,  thinking it's a typo. \nThis will be happening for awhile, especially if you have a mailman who has had this route for many years. Call your local post office and tell them these people no longer live there, that might stop some of the mail. Then mark everything else you get \"return to sender\". This will force your neighbor to deal with it. Nta", "They should have paid for mail forwarding. It's what we did  we moved.\n\nWith our current home the previous owners did not. And just like this post we eventually got sick of passing the mail to our neighbours (who are friends with the old owners). Last month I started just returning it to sender. Grown ass adults get to deal with their own concequences.", "NTA- Put a note on the door/mailbox for the postman/deliveries 'Mail for OP & OP's Partner only. Mail for Mrs & Mr Misogynist to number X'. Mark anything that gets through 'No longer at this address' and stick it back in the mail.", "The only mail you need to deliver to them is a change of addressed card from the post office (even thought it\u2019s super easy to do online)", "You are NTA. If your husband wants to run mail to them, let him, but don\u2019t ever do it again yourself. Just leave it in a single pile somewhere and if he doesn\u2019t take it to them, you throw it away every Sunday. \nI moved into my house in 2021, and I still get mail for at least 4 people who lived here at some point previously. I throw 99% of it away, but I did get something that looked important once, and I actually tracked down the local relative of the people who sold the house to us, and they came and it up. They were super grateful because it was important, but that is the only time I would ever do that. I don\u2019t even write return to sender anymore. I just throw it away.", "NTA. I had to tell my mail carrier directly they don't live here. This was after taking a pile to the post office and explaining. It takes them two minutes to do a forwarding mail request. Not your problem.", "NTA write \u201creturn to sender no longer lives here\u201d put at post office and the places will get the point and ask for change of address", "If you're in the USA, just draw a line across it saying RTS and raise the red flag or put in the outgoing mail box. The companies will stop sending mail.", "Nope.  This happened to me for a while when our mailman just somehow started switching up the mail in the boxes.  I would get neighbor\u2019s mail and they would get mine.  They would keep my packages and pretend they hadn\u2019t received them so I started writing \u201creturn to sender\u201d on all of their mail (including bills) until the post office finally sorted it out.  It took me making a very large fuss over a very expensive package before it was sorted out.  When I finally received the package, it was ripped open and my name and address were scratched off of the box.  So I don\u2019t even feel the least bit bad.   NTA.", "NTA . Write return to sender. No longer at this address and put in mailbox. If there is a barcode on front black it out with marker or the mail might still come back to you.", "Can you just put a note on your porch or mailbox for the delivery guy saying all mail for *name* should go to number xx or it will be returned to sender.", "To be fair, I once moved next door to my previous flat. It was really difficult to get our address changed with banks etc because when I filled in the forms only the street number was different so I guess that the clerical staff did not notice and assumed that our address was already updated on their records. I  had to eventually phone each institution.  The next time I moved it was to a different street but with nearly the same name, from King Edward Avenue to King Edward Road. This time when I filled in the forms I used a highlighter on the difference.", "To be fair, I once moved next door to my previous flat.

In most countries it's illegal to hold, open or dispose of other people's mail, but you can send it back to the post office, who can open it and return to the people who posted it in the first place.", "We had a similar issue here. We bought this house and the previous owners had gone through an acrimonious divorce and run up insane amounts of debt, then left no forwarding address. For a few weeks he would turn up intermittently to collect the mail but it soon stopped and I'd literally got boxes full. \n\nWe got fed up and started marking it 'not known at this address' but being debts, the companies clearly didn't believe it and the letters got more and more frequent and intimidating - like they'd have 'urgent' and 'final demand' stamped on the envelopes. We asked the postman to stop delivering but he said he couldn't.\n\nTook years to resolve, we had bailiffs arriving and everything. I was permanently terrified of arriving home and finding they'd got in and cleared the house!", "Put a box outside your front door with 'contents discarded after 10 days' written on the front. Dump all their mail in it. Tell them it's their job to come get it. Leave the packages next to it. Then use it. \n\nNTA.", "I got a former tenant's mail for 10 years, even after I read their obituary in the paper. After the first couple of years sending it back, I just threw it away.", "I taped a note in my old mailbox that listed the people actually living there and in large font put 'return all else to sender' because that post office was mostly useless.

They\u2019re probably like score, we no longer have to walk to the mailbox!", "After going through this with a previous resident for several years, I got tired of sending mail back to sender and just shredded/burned their obvious junk mail. Still got junk mail even after reading their obit in the paper 10 years later. Good luck prosecuting me for that."]}
