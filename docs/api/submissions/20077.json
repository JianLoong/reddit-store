That is if your parents were waiting for you to return. \n\nMost folks enjoy a happy drunk, which your fianc\u00e9 was. But he caused you to drive home while tired & emotionally upset which is never a good combination while driving.

It is understandable that you got upset in that situation. You had agreed on a specific time to leave, and it seems like your fianc\u00e9 did not respect that agreement. Being the designated driver, it is also important for you to prioritize your own well-being and ensure a safe drive home. \n\nHis reaction and continued silence after the incident is concerning. It would be beneficial for the two of you to have a calm and open conversation about what happened, how it made you feel, and how you can prevent similar situations in the future. Communication and understanding are key in maintaining a healthy relationship.", "NTA - I dont think anyone handled this situation perfectly. It also isnt worth arguing over. \n\nYeah, leaving a party when youve had a few can be hard sometimes and he was behaving like a drunk idiot when he got to the car. But overall, you really werent an AH \u2026 but it likely could have been handled differently.", "NTA. He definitely owes you an apology and unfortunately this feels like a red flag...if he isn't quick to take accountability, show he recognizes his role in this and commit to it being better in the future this is a bad sign.", "NTA  \n\n\nIf you had a plan to leave at @ 1030 but it's almost an hour and half later and you still aren't out the door that isn't you being impatient.

Tell him he can stay and take uber home", "ESH\n\nYou get that he won't have any time to socialize during his own wedding, right? Like you guys will be essential on stage, not interacting a ton or really catching up. This was his night to have fun and catch up with friends he hasn't seen in a LONG time. And while he was absolutely disrespectful of your time and energy, I think your expectation were also not realistic.\n\nThis would have been a good situation to get a hotel so he could party however long he wanted with old friends, and you could go crash at the hotel. Your dogs will be fine overnight.", "NTA, If he can't see what he did wrong, call the wedding off and save yourself a lot of grief in the future. This is how he will always settle disagreements. \n\nBTW, if you want to leave at 10:30 Pm, that is not the time to start saying your good'byes.", "NTA. This situation probably called for more forethought than you gave it but, in the moment, he was the AH. If he knew the reception started at 6:30, and you had to drive an hour and a half to get home, and he was going to want a lot of time to catch up with people, it would've been wiser for him to say \"Let's make arrangements with your parents and get a hotel so we don't have to drive home that night.\" But it sounds like as soon as he heard you were going to be the DD he decided that gave him cart blanche to do whatever he wanted because you were the only one who would be inconvenienced. He ignored your concerns, he acted irresponsibly while you were driving, and he still hasn't apologized to you. I think you need to demand an apology at this point or, if he won't give you one, tell him that is the last time you go anywhere with him if he's drinking and next time he can find his own way home.", "YTA OP.\n\nSuck it up and let your fiance speak to people he hasn't seen for 15 years, I'm sure you could cope with getting a little less sleep just this once for your future husband, surely?", "NTA you agreed on a time to leave.

It\u2019s unreasonable to not let your fianc\u00e9 talk to people he hasn\u2019t seen in years.  You should have napped in the car if you couldn\u2019t handle seeing him enjoy himself.   \n\nYou know on your wedding night in three weeks you won\u2019t let your fianc\u00e9 ruin your reception by talking to all his friends during it and neglecting you, the bride, the only person whose feelings, wants and needs matter.  \n\nHopefully everyone leaves your reception after just one hour because they didn\u2019t actually plan well for the night and get a hotel or find an overnight dog sitter.

You're not wrong for being annoyed about it but try and recognize that he's contributing to people feeling good about your upcoming wedding and giving good vibes that people will look forward to and carry over to your special day. Neither of you are wrong and this is an easy fix - talk about it calmly and move on to your wedding day, these things happen and it is more important that you both talk about it calmly and rationally without letting anger and emotion dictate the conversation. \n\nHe may have held you up getting home but I'm betting the people he talked to that night are already looking forward to your special day.

Isn\u2019t your wedding exactly the time to get drunk and have a party with old friends?\n\nNot at any wedding I've been to.

But I mean I could see both sides to that. We can\u2019t get in the weeds on that though cuz we don\u2019t know the OP or her fianc\u00e9, so it\u2019s hard to tell if that\u2019s being used to manipulate or if someone truly is being just not thoughtful. And I can get why the OP would feel it was that, because everyone\u2019s time is important. If you tell someone you\u2019ll be home around 10:30 pm, and they\u2019re baby sitting your kid, or your dog\u2026you should be back at 10:30 pm or at least give them a courtesy call that you\u2019re gonna be running late.", "\n**OP stop *editing* your responses.** Your first reply, to which I responded below, was very petulant and bratty.

You editing your post to make you look better later, just makes me question the entire authenticity of this post. \n\n\n~~Yes.

Because how you're describing me is exactly how you behaved lol. \n\nI'm not sure you should be posting on Reddit if you're so fragile that you can't handle someone joining in the discussion and not agreeing with you. \n\nYou seem like someone who's more timid in real life so you need to snap like a little dog on the internet to feel heard/get your point across. \n\nDon't worry I won't reply to you anymore. \n\nI wouldn't want to hurt your feelings :(", "That's part of the one-sidedness of AITA.", "> OP stop editing your responses\n\nI'm 90% sure I saw this comment a little while ago, and OP claimed to have **never** raised their voice.", "You\u2019re totally right. I try really hard to stay in the middle perspective for everything. I think I am being electively stubborn over this situation because of all the wedding planning stress over the past two months. It has been handled 100% by me as my MOH ditched me. Not only am I dealing with wedding stress but like, SO so so much more. So. Much. More. I really don\u2019t want to get into the details, but put it this way. Everyone in our lives who are aware of all the details are wondering how I have not had a nervous breakdown yet, and I\u2019m really starting to wonder the same. \n\nSo being that he knows that I am in a pretty fragile state, it just felt kinda extra crappy to yell at me.", "To be clear, I only edited one response. Which I acknowledge started off bratty. I apologize for not making my edit clear to the rest of the thread, I am replying on my phone which makes those edits challenging. I also apologize for being snarky when you were trying to advise. \n\nLet it be known to all that in one of my above comments I was snarky and then adjusted my response because I was rude. That has been the only comment edited.", "True", "Well they\u2019re saying they have raised their voice in past arguments, not during this one.

No harm no foul.", "He will provide his input when asked, but is not personally owning any responsibilities with wedding planning. Don\u2019t get me wrong, he has been supportive. But I own and facilitate all conversations with vendors, guests, bridal party, etc.", "If you were angry at him for leaving 10 minutes late, then maybe I would agree with him. An hour and a half is obscene. Especially as the DD, you have the right to complain. His behavior is concerning.", "NTA", "The issue here is not he took extra-time to chat but the fact he yelled at her while she was driving.

This is why NTA.", "It wasn't 15 minutes, it was an hour and a half after the 4th attempt to leave, aka 90 minutes. She was driving, and it was a long drive back. Your advice to the woman in this relationship is to apologize because he's \"social?\" And if she doesn't, she's not ready for marriage? She didn't go full silent mode, the guy who likes to talk, Mr. Social, did. I think you think telling her she's not wrong for being upset is you thinking you are being fair and balanced. Maybe, if it were the 1960s. \n\nIn this story, the man in the relationship, the person who wanted to drink and not drive, leaving that to her, is also the one who refused to leave in a timely manner. Ready for marriage means respecting your wife, and this issue is definitively not insignificant. He failed that basic test. I hope she takes a hard look at this before they marry because him walking all over her is not likely to improve over time.", "Except he freaked out on her in the car and kept trying to yell at her. Understandable that it takes a little extra time to get out of a wedding especially when you have your own wedding coming up, but not understandable to flip out at your partner for wanting to leave when it\u2019s 1.5 hours past your agreed leaving time and they\u2019ve been patient for almost that entire time.

Drunks typically lose track of time and behave emotionally; that doesn't make him a bad person.  OP needs to sit down with him and explain exactly what she's upset about.

If you have another view and advice present it to the OP, no need to try to challenge mine. We aren\u2019t debating. \n\nAnd in the very *least* the redditor sounds unhinged.

You told \"both of them.\" My point was there is one who is more culpable because the underlying issue is that he believes what he is doing is more important than her time primarily because he's having fun. That is the issue, his lack of respect for her and her time, and that isn't alcohol. That's  a belief system illustrated clearly by his silent response the next day. He thinks what he did was fine. \n\nHis apology without recognition and comprehension will not fix it. And if she apologizes, she is accepting her \"less than him\" role in their partnership. This is a pivotal moment in their power dynamics, particularly for her as a woman. Is she less than him? It wasn't 15 minutes; it was 90, and then she had a long way to drive. Somehow, he thinks he's entitled to be that person who takes more. You think he is entitled, too, if you think both people apologizing is equal. It's not. It was a very one-sided situation.", "But, like, I was within my reaction limits of expressing my frustration? I called him twice after 10 minutes because I know how he is when he drinks and was hoping to keep him on task.
