The side effects have been devastating and I've been unable to work.  My disability benefits were wrongfully stopped after my last assessment, despite multiple letters of support from doctors, and I'm currently gathering evidence for the appeal.  This means I don't have any money.  My OD is already maxxed out.  I cut my food intake down to two meals a day, then one.  I have used food banks but they can be a nightmare and take a long time to access as here in the UK you need a referral from someone like a doctor and it can take a while to get an appointment.  \n\nAll of this is just to demonstrate that I cannot afford to waste a penny.  On the 29th it was my birthday.  I got a call from my elderly uncle to say that he had sent me a birthday card.  He said don't get excited, it's just a card, there's no money in it as he can't afford to send any.  I thanked him, said it's fine and that I appreciate the thought.  But then he said he was calling to let me know he'd forgotten to put a stamp on it so I would have to pay the postage when it got here.  I told him not to worry but inside I did feel my heart sink, wondering how much it would cost.\n\nI got a card from Royal Mail saying they have an item for me on which postage wasn't paid and I need to pay.  I was shocked to see they were charging \u00a35.  I never thought it would be that much.  I decided not to collect it as I just can't afford to effectively spend \u00a35 buying my own birthday card.  \n\nThis morning my uncle called to ask if I'd received it.  I told him they wanted \u00a35 for the postage and I couldn't afford that, so i would just leave it.  I thanked him again for sending it though.  He got angry and upset that I wouldn't pay to receive it, and acted like I was rejecting the card and rejecting him.  I explained that he knows my situation and that I just don't have \u00a35 right now.  When he again insisted on me receiving the card because he \"sent it with love,\" I said that he could pay the \u00a35 charge for it to be released to me.  He refused, saying he's a pensioner and on a limited income.  I said I'm on no income at all right now.\n\nHe got quiet and ended the call.  Just now his wife phoned me and had a right go at me.  She said I'm ungrateful for not accepting the card, and manipulative for giving a \"sob story\" about why i can't pay for it.  She said I have an \"absolute cheek for asking Uncle A for money\" meaning asking him to pay the \u00a35 to release the card, and if my grandparents were alive they'd be ashamed at how selfish and inconsiderate I have turned out to be.  She said he spent time picking out a special card and they won't send me anything in future.  I didn't even bother arguing and just hung up.\n\nI don't feel like I'm TA for not accepting the card but maybe I am for telling him I wouldn't accept the card.  Looking back maybe I should have just pretended I received it?  Or am I really TA for not paying for it?
