I work hard to afford the things that I want. I\u2019m not very pretty but I am well put together and many of my friends compliment me on my outfit or other things I\u2019m proud of. It\u2019s a hobby I enjoy.\n\nMy husband S (27M) has always been my biggest supporter. He would listen to me and he\u2019s always surprising me with gifts of things that I\u2019ve been talking about or what I\u2019ve expressed interest in. I\u2019m always appreciative of his incredibly thoughtful gifts and I love them.\n\nA friend of S contacted me and told me that I should stop being materialistic and making my husband buy things for me. She said he complained about it a lot. I didn\u2019t want to accuse S without proof and I looked through his phone. We have open phones but I\u2019ve never wanted to look thru his before. I found countless messages of him calling me vain, materialistic, obsessed with my looks, picky. He also commented that I\u2019m not even pretty enough to be that obsessed with myself Debra times. He was complaining to friends, acquaintances, and people who barely know me. It was so hurtful that I cried for hours. \n\nBut I love my husband and I don\u2019t want him to think I\u2019m vain or materialistic. I gave away what I could and resolved to stop purchasing things and stop talking to him about them.\n\nS gave me a perfume discovery set because I had recently gained an interest in perfume. I thanked him but said I didn\u2019t need it.\n\nHe was confused and asked what was wrong with it. I told him that it was a lovely gift but I didn\u2019t need more perfume. I said I didn\u2019t want to be materialistic or vain. S said that he had seen my textbook on perfume and that I had bookmarked things and he knew that I was interested in it. He was teary eyed and kept asking what was wrong with his gift and why I didn\u2019t like it. He has been very distressed since.

I knew that was bullshit, that you wouldn't do that. So I decided to check your phone. Only to discover you tell your friends all the time how vain and materialistic I am, even that I'm not attractive enough to have such hobbies. I am still trying to decide if this relationship can be salvaged, but you should know that what you said about me had changed how I think and feel about the hobbies I used to enjoy, and you as my husband. You are not the man I thought you were, and I am humiliated that you badmouth me to so many people you know, not to mention mocking my looks behind my back. Certainly I do not want any further gifts from you. Frankly, I question whether I want you in my life at all. If you want to give me a gift, pack a bag and get out.\"", "NTA \u201cdistressed\u201d my ass. Frankly you should just tell him to look at his phone if he asks you why you don\u2019t want his gifts. Probably you are above his level (in personality, character and appearance) so he was disparaging you to people to try to make himself better by bringing you down while also keeping people away from you (those that could take you from him in his petty mind). The terrible thing is that he probably does actually like your hobbies/interests as not only is it feminine but it enables him to give you things, in his mind, in exchange for affection, to secure it, as he doesn\u2019t offer much else. So he\u2019s distressed as without things he can\u2019t offer a personality or something else to make him worth a relationship. \n\nIt\u2019s probably not true to my harsh take, but guys who get into relationships with women they \u2018hate\u2019 for their \u2018vanity and materialism\u2019 while enabling it (gifts/listening/encouraging it) tend to not be worth the time.", "NTA. Okay, Sis. Now you need to have the VERY open conversation.\n\nShow him the text from S. Then, ask him to open his phone and show him ALL of his messages. Tell him that it is unconscionable that he would say these things to everyone without ever once expressing it to you. Its devestatingly hurtful - especially after he's been so encouraging towards you. In fact, I'd screen shot his messages at this point and send them to yourself... just a small samplong. Show them to him and tell him only after S called you to call you out on your behavior did you look through his phone...\n\nHonestly Sis? I'd be absolutely devestated, too, and I have a thick skin. Its the two facedness and how far and wide he spread his nastiness that is so devestating. Its bad enough that he said you aren't good looking (its one thing to know in our hearts we aren't the most attractive but to hear it from our spouse...) but to discover he's saying it to other people is SO incredibly hurtful.\n\nI'm SO sorry... fundamentally, the backstabbing snake is who he is as a person. I'm so very sorry.", "NTA. What your husband has been saying behind your back actually shocks me as a married man of 16 years. I could never fathom even thinking something like about my wife let alone messaging so many people those thoughts.\n\nSomething is very wrong with your marriage and it needs the help of a counsellor.", "NTA, tell him what his friend told you and that you have visually verified what he was saying. \n\nSince he thinks you\u2019re vain, materialistic, and not that pretty, tell him a paper bag to hide your looks, might have been a more appropriate gift. \n\nYour husband trash talks about you. You probably read a portion of what he actually tells others. Either he has low self esteem, so he\u2019s tearing you down, or he\u2019s trying to break you down.", "NTA. But I really think you need to have a discussion with him about what his friend said, and that because of that statement you looked through his phone and tell him what you read. That if that is what he thinks of you, you don't need or want him to buy you those things. But he should really explain himself, and if he's either lying to his friend and complaining about a thing he actually enjoys doing, or if he is lying to you about enjoying treating you to these things but actually disliking it, or if the line is somewhere in the middle.", "NTA. First of all, he\u2019s not your biggest supporter, he\u2019s a two faced coward. He was cheering you to your face while tearing you down with others. \n\nSecond, unless you\u2019re falling behind with bills, failing to pay mortgage, putting behind more important expenses, such as healthcare or education, jeopardizing your job, legal status or personal relationships, you\u2019re fine. I bet he has hobbies on his own that cost some money, but I guess they\u2019re \u201cbeyond criticism\u201d. \n\nFinally, don\u2019t you dare downgrade yourself for this hypocritical idiot. You\u2019re hobbies and interests are valid and you don\u2019t have to throw them away because he doesn\u2019t approve. Get that make up back and kick his ass out.", "Well, NTA for reacting to what you saw but this isn't the approach that is going to heal your marriage. You're going to need to tell him about the phone call and about what you read. I'm going to take a wild guess here and say he was spinning false tales for attention but you won't know until you talk it out.\n\nIf it turns out that he actually loves your hobbies and was just spouting bullshit to look tough to his friends? He owes you a tremendous apology and total open access to his phone. \n\nIf it turns out that he really doesn't respect or admire you he owes you a separation.", "The only thing you did wrong was get rid of your things and try to make yourself less of who you are to appease him. \n\nHe's TA for being dishonest and two-faced all this time.", "this can\u2019t be real, right? NTA either way, but i\u2019m just flabbergasted that you\u2019re even considering that you might be the problem if this actually happened.\n\nyou have a *textbook* on perfume? that\u2019s not vanity, that\u2019s a profound interest and hobby.\n\nit\u2019s speaks to a man\u2019s character when he is attracted to women with very well-kept appearances but then belittles them for the time and effort that goes into it. there is absolutely no excuse for him to talk about you the way he did. it\u2019s very confusing that he acts supportive and listens to you talk about these things only to turn around and talk badly about you to others. that must be so devastating.", "NTA, but why are you accepting your husband\u2019s disdain for your hobbies and the fact he\u2019s running you down to everyone and anyone? It doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s ever said anything to you directly about how he feels. Keep your hobbies and ditch your husband. At the very least, you need to initiate a conversation around why he is doing this.", "NTA. Tell him what you know. Let him know you are aware that he trash talks you to friends, relatives and strangers.  I would immediately require counseling", "He is distressed because he has an idea that you\u2019re aware. Absolutely nta. Go grab a coffee and have a breather but you definitely need a sit down conversation about this", "NTA. Why are you protecting his feelings? I know you\u2019re scared and devastated and it\u2019s hard to be angry right now- but you deserve an explanation and one hell of an apology. \n\nAlso- S\u2019s friend is definitely trying to start shit. Is she jealous of your relationship? Was there ever anything between S and this person, cuz she KNEW what she was doing, and I\u2019m guessing she knew you wouldn\u2019t confront him over it and that she wouldn\u2019t be called out for it. Please prove her wrong and confront him.\n\nPlease please PLEASE confront him and have the tough convo. You deserve so much better, and I think you know that. \n\nIf he\u2019s \u201cdistressed\u201d it\u2019s because he suspects you know that he\u2019s been talking shit about you. Baby girl. You deserve better than a husband who says ANYTHING like \u201cshe\u2019s not even pretty enough\u201d. You\u2019re owed an explanation here.", "My wife and I have an agreement that we don\u2019t air our \u201cdirty laundry\u201d to others.  Prevents a lot of pain.  This is something you need to talk to him about.", "He wasn\u2019t being honest with you and now you\u2019re not being honest with him. Please talk to him and air this all out.", "NTA what's that about when a person shows you who they are, believe them?\n\nYour husband apparently thinks you're so vain and materialistic that it's worth telling the neighborhood. He apparently doesn't have any real respect for you yet he buys you things from the hobbies you enjoy to placate you. It's hard to tell if he's doing this out of guilt or if he just doesn't respect you period.\n\nTell him the truth, that you've been through his phone, seen what he's said about you to other people, and that he's really damaged your relationship by not coming to you with any concerns or irritations but instead gossiping about you to everyone who would listen. I'd be following that up with a demand that he explain himself and that he attend some marriage counseling with you if he's determined to save this relationship, because you're extremely hurt and can't look at him the same way now.", "Tell him what you saw, what an asshole talking like that behind your back.", "You need to confront him, your own husband said you're not good looking enough to care about how you look. he's the ahole. \n\nDo not let that pathetic Too Faced no good dude break your confidence.", "NTA\n\nHowever, you shouldn't change for him. You should communicate with him.\n\nI think you need marriage counseling. This kind of prolonged and frequent criticism of you makes me think that he's in the process of pulling out of the marriage emotionally, creating emotional distance from you and would eventually end up making himself emotionally available to another woman who he'd fall in love with.\n\nBecause from what he said, he doesn't like you at all. He may still love you, but he doesn't like you.\n\n>Sam: I want to ask for your daughter's hand.\n\n>Anderson: You mean you want to marry her, Sam?\n\n>Sam: Yes, sir.\n\n>Anderson: Why?\n\n>Sam: Sir?\n\n>Anderson: Why do you want to marry her?\n\n>Sam: Well, I...I love her, Mr. Anderson.\n\n>Anderson: Well, that's not good enough, Sam.\n\n>Sam: I beg your pardon?\n\n>Anderson: Do you like her?\n\n>Sam: Well, I just said I...\n\n>Anderson: No, you said you loved her. There's some difference between loving and liking. When I married Jennie's mother, I didn't love her. I liked her. I liked her a whole lot. I liked Martha for at least three years after we married. And then one day it dawned on me I loved her. I still do. I still do. You see, Sam, when you love a woman without liking her, a night can be long and cold, and contempt comes up with the sun. Do you understand all this I'm telling you?", "NTA although rejecting the gift without any explanation will put an additional stress on your relationship. You need to be completely open and honest with him - the text from the friend, you looking at his phone and everything you read that he said about you. He needs an opportunity to explain although I can\u2019t imagine there is an explanation in the world that could explain his behaviour. Unless you talk this out, you will never trust what he says to you again. That\u2019s no way to live. It also concerns me that you are so willing to change who you are in response to his cruel comments about you.", "Nope.  That's just how I am too. Complain behind my back once and I take it straight to heart. You won't ever have to deal with me in that capacity again.  Keep your gifts, keep your help, keep your pitiful reasons.", "LOL. Debra times. I love that autocorrect. Like Debra is known for repeating herself so much it has become a cliche.", "NTA but please don\u2019t change who you are for a man. No man is worth that, even if that man is your husband. Don\u2019t stop loving perfumes and make up and beauty products because of a man.\n\nI\u2019ve changed myself for a man before and it sucked. Please please don\u2019t let him change who you are.\n\nAnd tell him why you\u2019re upset.", "your husband should be your biggest supporter. i am so sorry. this is unforgivable to me and something i would divorce over as he has humiliated you to friends and family. he sucks", "Wait wait, your partner in life is trashing you to everyone and YOU want to change so he has a better opinion of you? Oh sweetheart you deserve better", "NTA for refusing the gift to make a point but you are being an asshole to yourself. Please don't change and squash yourself into a box for a man that clearly doesn't respect you, these are things that you like to do and make you feel good about yourself. This made me so sad to read because clearly it's affected your self esteem when you say that you're 'not very pretty', it's awful that he even said that you weren't 'pretty enough' for these things! How cruel! I bet you view him as very attractive even when he's probably very average looking because you love him? He should feel the same about you, I bet you are very beautiful and even more so because you take care of yourself. Again, please never change yourself and what you like to do for anyone because at the end of the day, you are the only person that has to exist inside yourself and other peoples (even our partners) opinions truly do not matter at all. Please bring these conversations up to him, let him know you went on his phone because of a comment made to you by a friend of his. If he feels comfortable enough to slag you off to everyone who will listen then he should feel comfortable enough to have it brought up to him, what he's said is disgusting and you can't let him get away with it. Honestly I'd consider taking some time apart for how disrespectful he's been to you but I do understand that you love him, it's a tragic twist of life when the ones we love hurt us, we go back to them for validation when really the only person you need to validate yourself is you. Please respect yourself and stand up for yourself against this poor excuse for a man", "YTA to yourself for not confronting your husband and changing your interests cause he\u2019s an ass. You need to confront him and actually communicate to work through this instead of just trying to move past it by conforming", "YTA for changing yourself for this asshole.

He can't be telling EVERYONE else that he has a problem with it and can't/don't tell you, and puts up a pretense of supporting you while also complaining about it.\n\nhe said you aren't pretty enough to be so focused on yourself? That is so hurtful. And it sounds so deceptive. You need him to say which person is the real face of his, the one you see or the one who complains to every one else.", "Your husband, the one person in the whole freaking world who is supposed to have your back no matter what, has been stabbing you in it for gods know how long. Jeez. Get pissed. You're NTA. A doormat, but NTA.

Unless he knows you went thru his phone his distress might be from thinking someone told you what he said. But honestly, what a dick! And the chick that alerted you?

But more than that, instead of confronting him and telling him to f- off, you\u2019re actively changing yourself for him as though his opinion matters more than yours. \n\nYou need to get a handle on your self esteem and have a serious talk about whether you want to be in a relationship with someone who consistently stabs you in the back while he smiles sweetly to your face.", "Every woman I've dated cared about skin care, fashion, makeup and other things considered feminine and I never thought or considered them all be vain or materialistic. If anything, I appreciated the effort they put into looking and feeling good and actually I find a woman's feminity very attractive.\n\nI feel like something else is going on with your husband because why would he buy you the items you like but talk bad about it behind your back? If he really did want to buy you those things he wouldn't. I'm guessing he's just going along with the comments that others are saying but not really believing them.", "NTA.

It could be a really productive conversation if you are both willing to set aside ego and have a deep heart to heart. He could understand what you gain from self care and you can hear how he has felt a lack of connection to that mode of self care and how it may be confusing for him.

I work hard to afford the things that I want. I\u2019m not very pretty but I am well put together and many of my friends compliment me on my outfit or other things I\u2019m proud of. It\u2019s a hobby I enjoy.\n\nMy husband S (27M) has always been my biggest supporter. He would listen to me and he\u2019s always surprising me with gifts of things that I\u2019ve been talking about or what I\u2019ve expressed interest in. I\u2019m always appreciative of his incredibly thoughtful gifts and I love them.\n\nA friend of S contacted me and told me that I should stop being materialistic and making my husband buy things for me. She said he complained about it a lot. I didn\u2019t want to accuse S without proof and I looked through his phone. We have open phones but I\u2019ve never wanted to look thru his before. I found countless messages of him calling me vain, materialistic, obsessed with my looks, picky. He also commented that I\u2019m not even pretty enough to be that obsessed with myself Debra times. He was complaining to friends, acquaintances, and people who barely know me. It was so hurtful that I cried for hours. \n\nBut I love my husband and I don\u2019t want him to think I\u2019m vain or materialistic. I gave away what I could and resolved to stop purchasing things and stop talking to him about them.\n\nS gave me a perfume discovery set because I had recently gained an interest in perfume. I thanked him but said I didn\u2019t need it.\n\nHe was confused and asked what was wrong with it. I told him that it was a lovely gift but I didn\u2019t need more perfume. I said I didn\u2019t want to be materialistic or vain. S said that he had seen my textbook on perfume and that I had bookmarked things and he knew that I was interested in it. He was teary eyed and kept asking what was wrong with his gift and why I didn\u2019t like it. He has been very distressed since. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It sounds like you are interested in fashion, make-up, etc. and have no expectation that your husband should fund that.  Yet he apparently thought he should.

He cannot have it both ways (be hurt by you not accepting his gift, but talks badly about you and your hobby), he needs to make a decision but he can't do that without knowing what's going on.

But it sounds like you are afraid to and also afraid you\u2019ll lose him. He did something incredibly painful & broke all trust. You need to talk to him about it! Big hug to you.", "Tell him the truth. Either you have an honest marriage or you can both keep on keeping secrets and eventually you'll break up.", "NTA.

Enough for them to feel comfortable talking shit about you. It\u2019s like they gave their opinion of you and instead of him standing up for you he cowardly agreed.

If you haven't clearly communicated with him face-to-face, that's definitely a big mistake.\r  \n\r  \nIn fact, your husband might not genuinely dislike your fashionable dressing and attention to attire. He might just enjoy undermining you in front of others, so changing yourself to please him might backfire.

He cannot continue being two faced and you need to hold him accountable and not yourself for being who you are.", "NTA. It makes me so sad that you are changing yourself for him.

Or tell him to ask his friend why.", "NTA.  His comments make it sound like he doesn't like you and telling people you're not pretty is a low fucking blow.

This is the person who is supposed to love you unconditionally. Do I joke about my husband\u2019s idiosyncrasies sometimes to my friends? Sure. But it\u2019s light hearted and never truly disparaging. That\u2019s not this. His words made you stop pursuing something that makes you happy and is trashing you for attention or some kind of weird satisfaction.

And you deserve better than him.", "Tell him the truth", "NTA. It worries me that your first instinct is to change yourself rather than accept that your husband is not the person you thought he was. If the roles were switched and you were in his position would you have done the same? Is there a world i which you would have shown such disloyalty and deceitfulness? Probably not. \n\nYou deserve a sincere apology at the very very least. You deserve to have an explanation, even if that explanation reveals that he is an unworthy partner. \n\nYou are not materialistic. He\u2019s got issues.

Tell him about what his friend said and how hurtful you find that he complained to friends without having a mature discussion without you about what was bothering him.", "NTA. There is reason you can\u2019t look at the messages again (OP wrote this elsewhere in the comments). It\u2019s because those messages reveal that the man you thought you knew, the one he pretended to be, is not the man he actually is.\n\nI\u2019m very sorry, OP. I don\u2019t know if I would ever be able to get past this while staying in the relationship, myself. If you think you can, I recommend couples therapy as a starting point. You may learn more about him and his rationalizations. But you will need to take what he says with a grain of salt going forward. He is not trustworthy and has been pretending. For what purpose? Could be infidelity. Could just be that he is mean spirited but able to put on a mask. Could be something else entirely.\n\nI doubt everyone sees you as not pretty. You may be less conventionally attractive but there are people who will find you stunning. The fact that he talks about you that way behind your back may be why you feel this way about yourself. You may have been seeing through his lies without realizing it.\n\nThe right person is out there. As others have said, there is no way to avoid pain right now. But if you move on you will eventually find new joy and the old pain will just be memory.\n\nYou deserve so much better. Maybe from him if you think that is possible, but definitely from someone. I can tell from the way that you write that you are a beautiful soul. You will find someone worthy of you - whether a new, reformed S or, if you move on, someone who would never do you like this. I am so very sorry for the suffering his strange actions have caused.", "NTA. Based on what you have written your self esteem is horrible.

How have you changed? \n\nAnd please OP start therapy.\n\nYour husband is definitely TA here but you would be TA to yourself if you don't start treating yourself better and girl go get your stuff, taking care of yourself and feeling good about yourself is better vain nor materiali7.", "Your husband is a bouble face AH\n\nThe mask he puts on when he is with you, is the mask he takes off when he is with his friends\n\nI find this upsetting\n\nNTA", "You haven't said much about your husband other than this lie.  Is it possible he is a narcissist?  They often run down their spouse to others to gain attention and sympathy.   They can be very kind to the spouse to gather the adulation or they can gaslight and demean. Whether he is or not a narcissist there is definitely something wrong here with how he is communicating with you and others.\n\nMarriage and love require trust and right now he does not have your trust.  Only open discussion can help you to determine what is happening in his head and possibly a marriage counselor.", "NTA.", "Absolutely not even the tiniest bit. You are NTA and I'm so so sorry you had to read those remarks from your own husband. My heart broke for you reading those. It's one thing to vent, it's a whole other thing what he did. You need to confront him about this whole thing and don't allow him to turn in on you, you've done nothing wrong. I would be heart broken if my partner said those things about me especially about my looks, that would really hurt. There is absolutely nothing wrong with taking care of yourself and this comes from someone who doesn't wear makeup unless I go out. You also shouldn't change who you are just to make him happy, that will eventually turn into other feelings that won't be good for you. Go back to being yourself and if you are not open to divorce I'd recommend counselling for you both but personally I don't think I could move past the hurt and backstabbing from the man who's meant to love me. I also believe his friend has said this to you to cause issues and feel she has her own motives. Again, I'm so so sorry you're going through this.", "NTA. I\u2019m SO sorry you\u2019re going through this. But please, don\u2019t ever change what you enjoy for someone who doesn\u2019t  even respect you.

But I should warn you - as someone who also looked at my ex\u2019s phone and found something devastating - proceed with caution. We also had an open phone policy, that is, until I discovered his lies. Long story short, he divorced me. \n\nPlease accept a virtual hug from someone who was in the same spot.

This isn't about you being \"vain\" or \"materialistic.\" When a partner badmouths you to everyone like this, while pretending everything is ok to your face, it's a symptom of a much bigger problem. I think he has lost feelings a long time ago, has likely been pursuing other women, and this is really just the tip of the iceberg. He is two-faced, and that takes a lot of practice. The fact that he can lie to your face so easily while expressing his true feelings to everyone else means that he has a whole inner world that he is concealing from you. I hate to say it, but I think the whole relationship is over, and has been over for some time.", "Oh hunny, I\u2019m sorry this happened to you.

It explains why he cannot comprehend why you would reject a gift he is so sure you'd appreciate.  Right or wrong, he senses that your rejection has nothing to do with the gift, but with who you would've had to thank for it.\n\nTo convince him otherwise, you'll have to point to the stuff you no longer have (cuz you gave it away) and the supplies you no longer order (presumably a bank statement or credit-card statement will support that).  \n\nAs to who is an AH, Husband wins that prize hands down.  He might've taken his relationship-damaging thoughts in private to a confidant, clergy or counselor.  Instead, he shopped his complaints around to anyone he thought might listen.\n\nIts a very cold consolation, but I think that rules out an affair with the talkative female friend.

He is gifting you these items and then turning right around and complaining to his friends. These gifts provide him with conversational fodder. To me, **it seems like he enjoys the attention he's getting from his friends, acquaintances, and anyone else who will listen**. You just happen to be collateral damage in his need for attention.

Preparations to either demand couples counseling and therapy, or to ultimately separate. Take screenshots of these messages and send them to yourself (I know in a comment you mention it was hard to read, but this who your husband truly is).

This behavior is divorce-level breech of trust! Tell him exactly what you have told us and demand that he join you in marriage counseling. And if he refuses, see an attorney. I'm serious. He isn't worthy of you, and if he behaves like this, he's not worth your devotion.", "Why are you trying to please him? He's the one in the wrong here.\n\nYou're just being yourself and he's the one talking badly about you to other people and saying he doesn't find you attractive.", "You\u2019re not getting it, OP. You are not the problem here. Your husband has been trash talking you all over town for trying to be the best version of yourself, while pretending to encourage you. He has been lying to you. \n\nIf you were as vain and materialistic as he says, you wouldn\u2019t be here talking about how you would give up everything to keep this man who pretends to be so wonderful while trash talking about you to all your friends. \n\nYou do not owe it to him to make yourself less than. You do not owe it to him to sacrifice your happiness and self esteem. \n\nYou deserve better treatment than that. You need to confront him about what his friend told you, and you need to confront him about all of the hateful things he\u2019s said about you to other people. \n\nIf you\u2019re too much for him, you need to find someone who is enough for you. You are not the one who needs to change. \n\nYou are NTA", ">I will definitely tell him that I know how he feels about me and that I\u2019m working on not being materialistic, vain, and shallow. I just wanted to work on it more until I could show more progress because all I\u2019ve done is gotten rid of the bulk of my collection and not bought anything.\n\nPresenting a put-together look isn't vain and materialistic in and of itself. It's ok for you to have a hobby focused on makeup, etc. You really need to stop looking at yourself for the solution to this issue and realize your man is the one who needs to set this right. Just because he made these nasty statements doesn't make them true. I ask you, do you truly believe yourself to be vain or are you simply accepting his words as your truth?", "Imagine that your partner is really into beautiful cars. He likes to work on them in his spare time. He reads magazines about cars, he does research on the history and science of cars, he loves to take his favourites to car shows and is so happy to discuss his cars with other enthusiasts. He saves for and buys special car-care products to make them shine. You give him gifts of fancy car-care products. You ride around with him, take pics of him and his cars. You are a big supporter of his hobby, tell him that you love how he values his machines. \n\nBut behind his back, you tell all your friends and work colleagues how dumb and materialistic and vain he is for pouring his time and money and pride into his pathetic cars, that don't even look that good. You tell them how embarrassed you are by his stupid hobby. Everyone in your life knows what an idiot your husband is for caring so much about something so shallow. They think you're such a good person for putting up with his ridiculous fascination and wasteful spending. \n\nWould you do that? If he found out how you speak behind his back, should he shamefully sell off his beloved cars and never speak of them again? Hell no!\n\nDon't cringe into a sadder and less vibrant version of yourself because of his ugly, vicious words and actions.", "Honestly rather than \"working on not being materialistic, vain, and shallow\" you need to work on your self-esteem and self-worth. You're so blinded by your love/adoration of him that you can't see that he's the problem not you.", "This response makes me so sad for you . This poor man has take an axe to your self esteem and you think you're the one in the wrong.", "My heart broke for you just reading this!  Please know that you are worth a far better man!", "Sweetheart, no. You are focusing on the wrong thing. You aren't vain and materialistic for liking nice things. Your husband is an insane asshole for buying you things and pretending to be supportive while slagging you off behind your back to anyone who will listen.

There is something terribly wrong with your husband.", "You don't need to work on reducing your personality. \n\n'Show more progress' is he your Dad, your boss or your teacher? You don't have to prove yourself to him. He is the problem here and you should really start appreciating yourself more. He betrayed you in the worst way possible - not only does he complain about you behind your back, he is doing this whilst smiling to your face and stimulating what he apparently dislikes, plus mocking you and your appearance as well. He is extremely two faced and obviously cannot be trusted whatsoever - you don't do this kind of stuff to someone you love. \n\nINFO: do you happen to have a better career/make more money than him?", "you are studying a science. skincare is a science too. fashion and makeup are artistry. please don\u2019t distance yourself from your passions because someone else doesn\u2019t approve.\n\nthat book sounds really interesting. i\u2019m putting it on my wishlist!", "You are an intelligent woman. What would you tell your best friend if she told you what you have just shared with us?", "Edit: NTA\n\nIt sounds like a very interesting book! I'm a nerdy woman not interested in makeup and fragrance. I use both as little as I need to so I'm \"professionally presentable\". I'm also not much into fashion. To be fair, I'm often very confused by it all. I admire women like you who put effort into being nicely put together! You're not shallow and materialistic for enjoying beauty. I would love to have a knowledgeable and stylish friend like you to advise me \ud83d\ude42 And to discuss the ***science*** of it all, what a treat! \ud83e\udd29 Please, please, please don't change who you are, you are great! \u2764\n\nOP, I don't think your husband is interested in your happiness. From what he's saying to people behind your back, I don't think he likes you as a person. Sadly, there are many men who are perfectly able to criticise a woman's looks and personality while enjoying in all benefits that a relationship brings.\n\nYou do know that you being stylish contributes to his social status, don't you? This is why he buys you things, because you make him look good! It's incredibly shitty of him to complain about something that you do that benefits him. It's even more shitty to do it behind your back. I'm enraged by his hypocrisy and betrayal!\n\nI was in relationships like that and it left a trauma. I understand why you're questioning yourself. I still don't see logic in men pointing out what is unattractive about me in one sentence and talking about sex with me in another. Interesting contradiction, isn't it? What I was doing wrong all my life was to accept that behaviour and try to change myself. I should have said to them to find someone they like better and just move on. Please don't waste your life like that!\n\nNow onto practical steps. I know it hurts to see those messages in his phone again, but please take screenshots of them. You need a proof, because he'll try to make you feel guilty or crazy for his shitty behaviour. If you don't feel comfortable accepting his gifts then don't (I understand why you wouldn't, they're not given with love). But please don't stop doing what you enjoy because of him! A true partner would bring up issues openly and work together to find solutions that benefit both of you. He's not a true partner, unfortunately. He's supposed to have your back, not stab it!", "Please stop making excuses for him. He said horrible things about you. When people show you who they are\u2026.. believe them", "I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this, OP. You definitely need to talk to him though. \n\nOn another note, I wanted to recommend a book for you if you\u2019re interested in perfume. It\u2019s called Jitterbug Perfume by Tom Robbins. It\u2019s fiction, and might be a fun read for you as you\u2019re also processing all of this with your husband. I learned a lot about perfume that I\u2019d never known, also.", "You seem like a smart woman. Why are you making excuses for him?\nIf you have come to this platform to seek advice/judgement you do realise deep down what happened was so wrong. Then why are you still defending this sad excuse of a man?\n\nIt's understandable that it's very difficult to accept it but it did happen, you saw it yourself. Anything beyond outrage, hurt, heartbreak would be an injustice towards yourself. \n\nNTA. Also please don't stop doing what makes you happy. I can bet every pretty penny that your hobbies were one the major reasons he chose you/fell for you. Don't ever change for anyone.\n\nEDIT: Also, you guys need counselling. Marriage and individual both.", "Therapy or even talking to you were real ways to get his emotions in check.", "Sweetheart! Don't hold yourself in such low opinion. Even if you're not a model you get compliments and take pride in your appearance. That is not Vain, vanity is making him cut costs or work extra to support your makeup habits,  vain is not working because you wanna be a beauty vlogger no matter the consequences ( nothing wrong with beauty vlogging but if your doing it to mostly make and watch videos of yourself or if it's not a sustainable career of its own and you're pretending it is) \n\nThe person you trusted most has been your worst bully and that is inexcusable. He might look fine on the outside but inside he is trash ment to be left on the streets and you're amazing beautiful and deserve the world, or bare minimum a partner you can trust to not talk shit about you behind your back like mean girls", "No no no no no. You do not have to change anything about yourself except learning to love yourself more.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with you. **You deserve to be loved just as you are.**\n\n*He* needs to change. *He* needs to stop talking shit about people he claims to love. *He\u2019s* the one with the problem, not you.", "Nothing you have written here makes you sound the slightest bit vain. \n\nThat your husband trash talked you to multiple people makes it sound like he is NOT your biggest supporter. In fact, it makes it sound like he actually doesn\u2019t like you very much.\n\nAnd I question the motives of the woman who contacted you to let you know the things that your husband has been saying about you.  Because if your retelling of what she said is accurate, there is no way that she was trying to do YOU a favor-it sounds like she\u2019s trying to drive a wedge between you and your husband or chase you off. \n\nAnd when you tell your husband, you know the things he\u2019s been saying about you-and you should absolutely 100% tell him that you know the things he\u2019s been saying about you-you should also let him know how you found out he\u2019s been seeing these things.\n\nYou are so NTA", "Stop that! *You* have done nothing wrong! In one fell swoop some mysterious person has knocked the confidence right out of you and that's not right! It will now be easier for your husband, and others, to treat you like crap because now you are full of self doubt.\n\nLet me give you a piece of advice I read awhile back: don't worry about what other people think of you, it's none of your business. Now, go wash your face, and polish that spine, sweetie...you have business to take care of!", "Show him the text from his work wife. That's what she is.\nAnd tell him you read his texts and confirmed how he really feels about you. I don't know how you could spend another second around someone like him.\nYou are NTA at all.", "You\u2019re not vain or materialistic because you like beauty, fashion, and skincare and YOU DONT NEED TO WORK ON ANYTHING. He is being a jerk. That\u2019s it. He\u2019s not being honest with you and he\u2019s making fun of you behind your back. You don\u2019t need to change yourself because there is nothing wrong with your hobbies.", "My girl NO NO NO. You do not need to \u201cwork\u201d on anything except communicating to your asshat husband what you\u2019ve found out about him and his asshat ways. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t in therapy, please find a counselor. You don\u2019t have the support you thought you did, and you need it now more than ever. \n\nYOU DID NOT MESS UP HERE. Obvs NTA but don\u2019t be one to yourself by trying to shrink who you are into whatever bullshit box you think he wants you in.", "Noooooo hunny-- you need to tell him straight up that you've seen what he says about you to other people. You tell him that it was hurtful beyond belief, that never in a million years would you say such things about him to others so what gives him the audacity to treat you that way??\n\nI get you love him OP, but this behavior is insanely concerning. I have an aunt who went through something like this, except her husband went around telling anyone that'll listen that he was going to divorce her. She didn't have a clue there was even a problem in their marriage until someone at his work told her what he was saying. And apparently it was said long before she even met his coworkers, so she ended up feeling like their first impression when meeting her was \"well, she won't be around long\". Really really messed her up & took her another 3 or 4 years to figure out the husband was a narcissist & she divorced his ass. \n\nNot saying that your husband will do the same, but the similarities of telling everyone around the spouse the information that the spouse themselves should've been told privately is alarming. Stand firm with your husband on this issue, don't cave in to his horseshit, demand the answers you seek from him & DONT. LET. UP.  Swear to God OP, if I gotta witness one more Redditor update a post with complete submission to their SO's vile behavior ONE MORE DAMN TIME", "You need couples counseling. You for thinking you need to change and him for being two face about his feelings", "ESH. Something doesn\u2019t add up here. You\u2019re eloquent in your post and seem to have a rational grasp on your interests and hobbies. You presented the situation in a way that suggests that you *know* your husband is in the wrong and yet your responses have all been martyring and self-deprecating.\n\nSelling your clothes and makeup because of this makes no sense at all. Nor does you pleading that you\u2019ll change to be \u2018less-vain.\u2019 Either you\u2019re trying to punish your husband in a passive-aggressive manner, or you\u2019re trying to humble yourself to prove to your husband that you\u2019re worthy. Look up codependency.\n\nYour description of your husband makes him sound like a nasty, backstabbing, a-hole. Yet on multiple posts where people are backing you and your choices, you\u2019re defending him and making him out to be some pious Adonis. \n\nChanging your interests, hobbies or appearance to suit this man won\u2019t make him respect you.\n\nEdit: grammar", "WTF?
