I told them they didn\u2019t have any proof that I was ungrateful and unappreciative for what I had, except for my parents word which wasn\u2019t much. I also asked why they never came to a single one of my \u201cbirthday parties\u201d, why I went to a much shittier school, and why I spent so much time in my room when they came to visit(something I really didn\u2019t mention in my first post; they wanted me upstairs in my room for about 75% of all visits because they said they were \u201cembarrassed\u201d by me). I also had my sister vouch for me, saying they only wanted a golden child.\n\nAbout half of them believe me now, some still can\u2019t decide who\u2019s in the right, and some are saying that it\u2019s reasonable to want a perfect child and that kids are nuisances and that my parents were 100% in the right. \n\nI also determined that my sister had to know something was off. I told her that it would be a bit before I trusted her 100% again. She agreed (seemed surprised when I said it though).\n\nI\u2019ve looked into therapy as well and my first appointment is in two weeks. Currently, I still have an urge to call my parents because I  don\u2019t want to lose them, in case they change their minds. Something else in my head is telling me not to though. One of my close friends even told me that I should sue my parents, and that their wife\u2019s brother worked for a really good firm and that they could help me hire them. I don\u2019t really think the neglect was that serious for a lawsuit however.\n\nI also wanted to say thank you to all the people who reassured me I wasn\u2019t in the wrong and also gave me advice.

It's not. There's a term called \"Stockholm Syndrome\".\n\n***It is supposed to result from a rather specific set of circumstances, namely the power imbalances contained in hostage-taking, kidnapping, and abusive relationships.***\n\nTherefore, it is difficult to find a large number of people who experience Stockholm syndrome to conduct studies with any sort of power. ***In this situation, your parents have been inflicting mental/emotional torture & OP is wrongly thinking it's love attaching more to them thinking they'll change.***\n\nI was told a phrase: ***\"I'm looking in a freezer for a hot drink\". Can never get the warmth & affection from parents as never had the inclination & won't ever be able to. Yet, still keep hoping against hope.*** It took years to get to this point unlike a broken leg, that can be mended in an expected amount of time through surgery or a cast. ***In this situation, there's no definitive time to heal.  It may take time away to detach & heal.***\n\nSpace & time away from their acidic toxicity will allow a positive perspective of you & negative of them.

I am amazed how much kids want to believe the lie parents are good or will change. I had a kid whose mom would literally chain her to the bed for 12+ hours a day. when we first started therapy she said if she was just better her mom would not have to chain her up. This kid was good just shoplifted some food because her mom did not buy food. \nI am sorry they treated you like that. You did not deserve this. What your parents did was abuse.", "I wouldn\u2019t talk to my parents again, I think your height is just fine.", "You should think strongly about going no contact now. Your parents are getting older and will have health problems sooner or later. They are self centered and will be fine using you when they need help. Care giving is hard and can be very expensive. Don't let your parents treat you badly your whole life and then expect you to give up your time, effort and money for them later.", "Definitely go no contact with the parental units.  They sound toxic AF.", "I totally agree with this response. They are awful parents, just awful. How can you do that to a child? Go no contact you do not owe them anything when in their old age they come to you to be looked after, say no.", "^^^ yes agreed. I get the desire to have parents, but we need to go where we are wanted. Hanging onto people who treat you poorly and with contempt is way worse than not having anyone at all. I'm sorry, OP. You deserve so much better.", "Great way of framing it!!!", "I think it would be best for OP not to contact their parents at LEAST until they have a therapist on their team. It is not a good idea right now.", "They didn\u2019t want a perfect child, they wanted a performance piece so that they\u2019d get compliments and social standing.

You\u2019ll just be hurting yourself.", "Well if they only hurt you, why would you want to return to that.\n\nEmotions are irrational. Your emotions are ignoring the rational part of that entire statement. They don\u2019t care that someone\u2019s hurting you because you really want their approval. But the rational part of you just has to keep telling the emotional side of you you will never be good enough for them. They\u2019ve made that quite clear. It\u2019s hard to become wanted when you were originally unwanted\n\nKeep forging forward and building a good life for yourself. Then while this isn\u2019t technically any of your sisters doing, you really might want to separate contact with her or drop it to as minimal as possible. She will always be a link to your parents, and she honestly doesn\u2019t seem to have much empathy for the position you were put in.", "I call bs that ur sister didn't know she was favored.

It's not serious like that.  It may be serious for your *heart* and mental health, but it's not a legal matter.  What would you even say to the judge?  \"My sister got 10 presents and I got my favorite meal!\"  The judge will have nothing to grasp onto, it's a loser case.  There are no laws to govern \"equal treatment\" for each kid.  It's legal to have a favorite kid, and blatantly show it.\n\nBut you know that.\n\nWhat ISN'T a loser case is your own sense of self-preservation.  You are right to send the email, to defend your good name in a sense, and you are right to go no-contact or low-contact if that's what you need to finally feel OK in the world.\n\nNTA.
