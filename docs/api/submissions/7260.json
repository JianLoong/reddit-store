I told them they didn\u2019t have any proof that I was ungrateful and unappreciative for what I had, except for my parents word which wasn\u2019t much. I also asked why they never came to a single one of my \u201cbirthday parties\u201d, why I went to a much shittier school, and why I spent so much time in my room when they came to visit(something I really didn\u2019t mention in my first post; they wanted me upstairs in my room for about 75% of all visits because they said they were \u201cembarrassed\u201d by me). I also had my sister vouch for me, saying they only wanted a golden child.\n\nAbout half of them believe me now, some still can\u2019t decide who\u2019s in the right, and some are saying that it\u2019s reasonable to want a perfect child and that kids are nuisances and that my parents were 100% in the right. \n\nI also determined that my sister had to know something was off. I told her that it would be a bit before I trusted her 100% again. She agreed (seemed surprised when I said it though).\n\nI\u2019ve looked into therapy as well and my first appointment is in two weeks. Currently, I still have an urge to call my parents because I  don\u2019t want to lose them, in case they change their minds. Something else in my head is telling me not to though. One of my close friends even told me that I should sue my parents, and that their wife\u2019s brother worked for a really good firm and that they could help me hire them. I don\u2019t really think the neglect was that serious for a lawsuit however.\n\nI also wanted to say thank you to all the people who reassured me I wasn\u2019t in the wrong and also gave me advice. Have a nice day to anybody reading this.", "created_utc": 1673641559, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10b4jmw/update_to_aita_for_telling_my_parents_off_for/", "score": 605, "replies": [">some are saying that it\u2019s reasonable to want a perfect child and that kids are nuisances and that my parents were 100% in the right. \n\nThen don't have kids if they are nuisance. OP you're NTA here in any way. Your sister has your back. Go low/no contact with your parents if you can.", "Good to see this update, OP! Good luck moving forward and I hope things go well :))", "OP, I would totally go no contact with them. They admitted that they never actually wanted you. So give them what they want. You are no longer their child, they will never hear from you again.", "Wishing you the best OP. Glad you're going to get some therapy too. \ud83d\udc9c", "You are worth all the good things in life. So stop chasing after  those who do not deserve  you and build you own family. Good luck", "Do Not contact them.\n\nAt the very least don\u2019t do so until you are in a Much better place both emotionally and mentally.\n\nFor now the source of poison is cut of. Don\u2019t go back until you have healed and build an immunity to it.", "I just need you to know that the family members who are saying all this is fine and dandy are totally fucked as well.\n\nAnd this stranger is mad proud of you for breaking free!", "And who wants a perfect child anyway?\n\nNobody's perfect. If you think someone is, then you're probably blind or ignorant to their faults.", "Those people should never have had kids.", "I had a baby last year and so many people act like normal baby stuff is \"bad behavior\". Like dude she's growing mouth bones. I would be in a bad mood too.", "I'd cry too if I couldn't walk and was sitting in my own poop. Babies are actually pretty rational.", "> Kids are nuisances and that my parents were 100% in the right.\n\nGuess we know which relatives are dying alone in nursing homes. Please block all of them, none of them add anything good to your life, only anxiety and stress.", "Definitely not in the wrong, they say they never wanted a son, I say give them that wish and cut them off permanently keep them out of your life, they are toxic, abusive, and you don't deserve that treatment. Anyone who takes up their view needs to be cut off as well. Your parents aren't going to change, they will continue to make you miserable if you allow them to. I'm glad you're getting therapy to help you heal, just please, please don't let them back in to hurt you.", "Going NC with parents is hard for most even when they have been treated like shit for years. So happy you are getting into therapy. Please resist the urge to make contact until you have at least a few sessions under your belt. You\u2019ll likely find that in that time you\u2019ll realize your life is better without them in it. Find your chosen family and give your love and attention to those who deserve it.", "\u201cCurrently, I still have an urge to call my parents because I don\u2019t want to lose them, in case they change their minds.\u201d \n\nThis sentence broke my heart. OP I wish you nothing but the best and hope you can heal from what these horrible people have done to you.", "OP let them call you if they want to apologise and salvage a relationship.", "NTA, did you send this same info to your parents?  You should.  It would be telling to see their reaction to all the crap they made you go through, now stinking in front of everyone\u2019s eyes.", "Best of luck to you OP.  At least some of those people have made their true selves known, and now you know you don't need to give them another minute of your time.", "Sending hugs and well wishes!!\n\nI'm so proud of you!!", "You have a nice day too OP, I love how you handled this. I know your pain brother in a way way smaller version than this but I was about to cuss this person out and you did it do so gracefully asking to speak to your parents class. You\u2019ve got class OP and I would listen to your gut instincts and  not call your parents either. Hopefully they will regret their behavior and come around.", "> One of my close friends even told me that I should sue my parents, and that their wife\u2019s brother worked for a really good firm and that they could help me hire them.\n\nAnd that friend is an idiot, don't listen to him.\n\n>  I don\u2019t really think the neglect was that serious for a lawsuit however.\n\nEven when the neglect is serious, it is almost impossible to sue for that. You seem like a smart person.", "OP I believe the relationship will likely never improve and your parents will not see the error of thier ways if you never hold them accountable for how they mistreated you all those years.  IF you continue to allow them to be in your Life while they talk down about you, nothing will change.  \n\nYears from now, when you are living your best Life, shitty people will always come back because they need something from you, whether that is validation, money or a kidney, you can decide then if that is something you want when the dynamic of the familial relationship is in your favor.  \n\nOn the brighter side, OP you may not see it presently, but someday in the future you might get to put them into a crappy retirement home.  Godspeed.  Sorry your parents suck.", "I think it is normal to want your child to be happy healthy well have friends and be successful.   However,  when they are not, the appropriate response is to help them overcome any challenges, not hide the child away.", "Especially since they aren't actually able to verbally communicate what is wrong. I mean imagine having a massive issue that you can't do anything about and you can't tell the people who can help you sort it out because you can't talk to them.", "You once we're in a bad mood because of that actually xD", "OP please go no contact with your parents. The voice in your head telling you not to is the voice every neglected child has, because all they want is the one thing they never got, a parents acceptance. Every child yearns for that and every child deserves that.\n\nI know from experience though that when you allow yourself to accept and grieve for the fact that unfortunately you will never get what you seek and move on your life and mental health will become so much better. \n\nI wish you the best.", "NTA - PLEASE go No Contact with your parents. They will hurt you again and again and again. It took me 58 years to realize it, don't make my mistake, have a healthy life!", "My one year old says a couple things. Like Mama, up and no. And Bluey lol. She cries, mostly because she needs something and can't tell me what it is. Only gets super loud if she's tired. Being tired makes me grumpy too", "NTA\n\nYou've been raised in a weird, abnormal situation. Sorry, but you aren't fully aware of what normal is. You've told repeatedly this is normal. It's not. There's a term called \"Stockholm Syndrome\".\n\n***It is supposed to result from a rather specific set of circumstances, namely the power imbalances contained in hostage-taking, kidnapping, and abusive relationships.*** \n\nTherefore, it is difficult to find a large number of people who experience Stockholm syndrome to conduct studies with any sort of power. ***In this situation, your parents have been inflicting mental/emotional torture & OP is wrongly thinking it's love attaching more to them thinking they'll change.***\n\nI was told a phrase: ***\"I'm looking in a freezer for a hot drink\". Can never get the warmth & affection from parents as never had the inclination & won't ever be able to. Yet, still keep hoping against hope.*** It took years to get to this point unlike a broken leg, that can be mended in an expected amount of time through surgery or a cast. ***In this situation, there's no definitive time to heal.  It may take time away to detach & heal.***\n\nSpace & time will allow self-esteem to grow, become more self-reliant & allow one their independence & be happy at peace. They've been torturing being a reflection of them. ***Whoever didn't believe, don't need them, didn't help before so wash hands of them.***", "I really don't think you have a case to sue them so tell your friend to let that go, but you really should just go no contact. I understand acutely how much you want a relationship with parents, but you need to look at the fact that these people went out of their way to abuse you your entire childhood. The vision you have of wanting parents is reasonable, but they are not the people you are looking for.", "Indeed, people who talk like this are people you don't need to spend any time on anymore.", "I happen to get cranky when I have to grow mouth bones. And I have the option to take them out, I just don't want to.\n\nWisdom teeth suck.", "You *were* in a bad mood!", "Is it weird that mine can't talk yet but makes a very specific mouth noise when she wants food?", "I got cranky bc one of my wisdom teeth decided to grow in horizontally and I can't afford to get them removed. I completely empathize with babies. Mouth bones are so bad.", "Or, as they get closer to their first birthday, they try to communicate the best they can through babbling and we can\u2019t understand it.", "Your family is screwed up so I see where your parents get their ideas from.  Just go no contact for your own health.  I doubt they will ever come around.  Just tell them that they are an embarrassment as parents.", "Nope, those are hungry cues. Good job picking up on that!"]}
