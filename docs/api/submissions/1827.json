{"id": 1827, "submission_id": "ypwwpr", "title": "AITA for calling my GF sexist, kicking her out and causing her to get fired?", "selftext": "Okay, so I am not a native English speaker, so please have patience.\n\nEarlier this week I (33M) got a cold. Not the panini one, I got tested, just a regular cold. I usually got these once every 1-2 years and I always do the same the same - I sleep for a day or two and then I am as good as new. So when I got one on Sunday I did spend the Sunday sleeping. My (now ex) gf (24F) called me on Sunday and asked for me to work from my place as I have a cool home office setup a comfortable chair and extra monitors. I agreed, but I told her I was still not feeling good, so I would (probably) be sleeping the whole day on Monday, and would probably not be in a mood for anything, so she should not disturb me. She said \"I would take care of you\" to which I responded that I am more than capable of doing that myself, and all I wanted was to not be disturbed. She agreed.\nOn Monday she came, I let her in, greeted her and went back to sleep. She tried to talk to me, but I excused myself, telling her that I do not feel good and I wanted to sleep. So she started working. Now, her job was some sort of tech support, but sorta high level. She does not have much to do, unless some other support has a problem that they cannot solve, then she has to. Or something like that, I am not really sure. So GF does not usually have much to do, but when she has - she has to react immediately. Naturally she had a lot of free time that day and probably had some ideas to spend a lot of it with me, but all I was doing was sleeping, so she got annoyed. She proceed to wake me up a few times, tried to talk to me, or tried to baby me about my medicines. I explained to her that I am not taking medicines for a stupid cold and that cold heals in half a week with medicines and 3 days without. At some point she get really annoyed that I ignored her and started whining how I do not feel that bad, if I had I would have had medicines and so on and so on. I snapped back and asked her if she had come to my place to argue or to work. She said that she wanted to spend time with me, but I was being a lazy asshole with my \"manflu\". I cut her and asked \"Mine what?\". It escalated to a short argument, and I called her sexist and to get the hell out of my place. She argued that she was like 40 mins from home and she is \"on the clock\". Honestly I had had enough of her, so I told her that I don't care and to leave and never call me again.\n\nWell, she did, and berated me. Apparently she had a case while walking towards my place, couldn't help on time and got fired. I guess she was already under the radar, but I didn't bother to ask. I just answered \"I told you to never call me again\" and hung up.", "created_utc": 1667937860, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ypwwpr/aita_for_calling_my_gf_sexist_kicking_her_out_and/", "score": 109, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She didn\u2019t respect your boundaries. If she got fired over this then it\u2019s likely there have been other issues at work. So you didn\u2019t get her fired she got herself fired. \n\nThe only mistake you made was letting her come over. You knew you needed to sleep so you should have just told her no.", "NTA - She invaded your home, harassed and insulted you instead of working when you were doing her a favour. Your reaction was reasonable and the fact she got fired is unfortunately but ultimately a consequence of her actions.", "NTA\n\nYou set reasonable boundaries. Not sure why she was saying you were acting that way because you are a man. When I get the kind of cold you have, I just want to be left alone in bed - don't feel social and there really is no medicine that helps a virus except hot tea helps make me feel better.\n\nI doubt very much that she got fired because of ONE infraction. No one gets fired for one error. And she could have handled it proactively in most work situations by calling her supervisor and explaining there was an emergency and she would be off line for 45 minutes and if \"time was of the essence\" why did she walk home - she could have called an UBER and been home in 5 minutes or so - if you can walk it in 40 minutes you are pretty damn close by car.", "NTA. you told her your conditions for her working at your place, and she violated them. If her job was in such a fragile position, she should have had a more solid plan or left you alone, like you asked. Also, she might be lying to you about being fired.", "NTA.  You set boundaries, re-iterated those boundaries, told her exactly how the day was going to go, what you didn't want to happen, and she ignored all of that, several times.  I don't know how much clearer you could have made it.  As far as the others saying you are an AH for not knowing what she does, you do.  She is an upper level tech support that gets rollover tickets from lower levels that they can't handle.  No, you don't know her exact duties but is that really a problem?  Did you exhibit some AH behavior and short tempered responses, yes... but that comes with the territory of being sick.  She was under some weird delusion that she knew what was best for you and could take care of you, despite you telling her exactly what you needed.", "NTA rest is best for a cold and she wouldn't let you have it. And yes, man flu is very sexist. I'm sure she would have been justifiably upset if you'd made a crack about her being on her period or something. You weren't obliged to let her stay at yours, where she was hindering your recovery by not letting you rest.", "NTA, you could have let her stay finish, but eh you were sick and she was being a jerk. She learned a lesson that day at least. Glad you're out of that toxic relationship. She'll learn and move on. She was probably already on thin ice if she got fired over one infraction, she shouldn't have started an argument while at work. You still allowed her to come over while you were sick and just asked not to be bothered while she sleeps. If she wanted to \"help\" you it should have waited til after she was off. You might've felt better by then that some soup or cuddles would have helped by then, but now she doesn't get to know.", "NTA. You told her ahead of time that you would be resting all day and she ignored that and bothered you consistently. That shows a lack of regard for boundaries, and even if she wanted to help she should have taken no for an answer. It wasn't great of you to throw her out while she's on the clock, BUT it also sounds like she was bothering you and not really working while at your apartment either, so that's on her. \n\nAlso man-flu is sexist and stupid. There was no call for her to toss that in there.", "NTA. I absolutely hate if someone tries to get me to do something when I have cold. Like, let me sleep, f off with medicine, it's not needed. Your gf sounds exhausting honestly", "NTA\n\nYou set your boundary with her about what you need to feel better and she didn't listen.\n\nFrom her side, she was trying to take care of you by asking about medicines (etc). She got frustrated at your refusal to let her help. Is this the first time you've been sick while you've been together? Maybe she was trying to show up for you but wasn't going about it the right way.\n\nIt's her responsibility to be on call and she was too busy trying to hang out with/take care of you so that's on her.", "ESH Your girlfriend annoyed you when you were sick so you broke up with her? Sounds like it was not a solid relationship\u2026", "ESH. \n\nSounds to me like you guys weren't a good couple, fought over nothing, and are probably better off without each other now.", "NTA. It's pretty insulting to have somebody confirm repeatedly that they understand the parameters of  using your home office and your boundary when you are not feeling well who then proceeds to completely disregard those parameters and boundaries. I'm really terribly sorry that she behaved that way. I think it's very apparent that you guys were not a good match for a long-term relationship. I hope you feel better very quickly and more so good luck in finding somebody who is a respectful and supportive partner.", "Why were you dating her? You two sound completely incompatible. I\u2019m not calling you the AH, but you sound like a really unpleasant person to be around, if I\u2019m honest.", "Y\u2019all both just sound toxic and age difference is probably a factor. Both of y\u2019all are assholes. You are because she was just trying to help and you got mad at her. She is because she is bothering you while you were sick sleeping. Should this have caused a break up? Not at all. Both sound immature.\n\nEspecially you because you caused her to get fired by allowing her to work from your home then kicking her out mid shift.", "ESH\n\nIt sounds like you've broken up over this, so there's not much to say, other than yes, she was an asshole to keep harassing you when you told her you'd be sleeping and to leave you alone. You could've given her one more warning... \"if you come in here one more time, I'm kicking you out. Do your job or leave.\" \n\nIt doesn't sound like you'll miss her much.", "First off, what's a \"panini one\"?\n\nI get it, you are sick and grumpy.  How long have you been dating? has she seen you sick before?\n\nHonestly, she acted like an ass after you told her she come come over, but not to bother you. She had no right to get pissy because she couldn't spend time with you, but honestly, you guys sound like you didn't like each other much anyway, so no loss when it comes to the relationship. I do think that you over reacted if this was the first time she has been insensitive, and to force her out knowing she might lose her job was really unkind.\n\nESH.", "Imagine taking advice from mostly teenagers", "People in this sub just want confirmation bias served.  What a joke.", "ESH. She was too insistent on \"helping\" and should have left you alone, but you didn't need to kick her out in that manner. It sounds like you had a large tantrum on her. At 33 I would expect more maturity than that when reacting to someone calling you a name. Most people have been insulted and don't resort to screaming matches.", "YTA. On many levels. You do t even know what she does \ud83e\udd23 I bet she\u2019s told you a dozen times and you nod and say \u201cgreat\u201d and pay no attention.  That attitude permeates your entire post. \n\nIt\u2019s not your fault she was fired and you had no obligation to let her stay in your apartment, but you are almost certainly an AH.", "NTA for the specific situation, though I thought it was a bit harsh. But dude - so much drama and toxicity in your relationship. It seems you both are better of without each other anyway.", "Eh. Your not feeling well but both of you are kinda immature. You\u2019re sick. You don\u2019t feel good. I get it. She\u2019s needy and clingy. In all honesty it was probably best you break up bc what would you get every time you get sick? This treatment.
