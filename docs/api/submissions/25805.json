I wasn't sure about it because my sister is known to take advantage of me being her older brother. But I ultimately agreed because I figured I would just set boundaries. She was impossible to work with, pushed my boundaries, and I was working on it a lot longer than intended because of how much she wanted done and how detailed she was about everything. It took 2 weeks of me doing a few hours every day for her to be okay with it.

So she decided on the name Birdie for her daughter. Cool. She told me I'd need to fix the name in the nursery and I told her no, she'll have to find someone else to fix the name in the nursery because I won't be doing that again. She said it will look off if done by someone else and I told her it was not my problem.\n\nShe yelled at me and then she tried to get my wife to change my mind.

This might make me an ass because it might be weird in the future for my niece to see the old name she has never used instead of her actual name.

In this case, you picked a great friend who is now your wife, and unfortunately you're stuck with your sister.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is a piece of work.", "NTA.

Her next stop is probably your parents, but good that your wife has your back.", "NTA. Your sister sounds like the one who is being petty. She wanted free labor and she should be happy with what she got.", "Definitely NTA. You've already gone above and beyond. Something something choosey beggars?", "NTA. Of course not.", "NTA, and you have a good wife there. Your sister is ridiculously entitled, thinking she can waste your time like that.", "NTA. You've just been bullied. Notice the subtle escalation of reasoning. From \"I'd need to fix the name....\" to \"...look off if done by someone else...\" to \"...I'm being a dick....\" She has shifted the entire problem to your fault. Then she goes for the ultimate \"...daughter doesn't deserve....\" Oh the guilt-trip. Followed it all up with nice projection, \"....me to be petty over our issues.\"\n\nSo you're the problem, future niece deserves better, and you're just petty.
