I guess only the cats really know.", "I named my cat Cat. It was easy to remember.", "Blew my mind when I realized that. And I saw her in SVU well before Doctor Who, but I didn't make the connection that was her when I started watching Doctor Who.\n\nThen I saw some SVU rerun she was on and I was like HOLY SHIT", "I was going to say, Maybe his sister's favorite movie is Hope Floats and she named her after Birdie. haha", "only appropriate nickname for Elizabeth is Lizard Breath", "Bee is a slightly weird but totally cute nickname. Birdie is a cool nickname too but kinda crazy as a given name, though obviously that is way different if somebody was an adult choosing it as opposed to a small child that was forced to have it.\n\nI have a super simple and common (male) name so I am not sure if the majority of people know how to spell Beatrice since sometimes stuff a bunch of people do not know how to spell will surprise you.", "That would be so cute.", "Busy naming her child Cricket is totally cool with me but otherwise, uh, awkward unless that child becomes a famous painter or naturalist\n\nA billion times more normal than trying to name your child a charactern though", "I know a woman from Northern Ireland that goes by \"Birdie.\" Her real name is Bridget. \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "Yeah and I think in badminton there's a thing called a \"birdie\"!

If it\u2019s a shortened name or nickname that is accepted by the child, fine. Your Irish lady still has also the option of using Bridget, if she wants too.

When I told my parents that's what I wanted to go with they were both surprised; they didn't have an issue with the fact I want to change it, but they both questioned why I'd pick such an \"old lady name.\"", "Nothing beats being Kanye West\u2019s child and having North as a first name."]}
