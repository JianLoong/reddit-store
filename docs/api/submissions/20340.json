Recently, Jill and I have been trying to hangout more, but it's usually at their place while the kids are there. I love her kids, but it means that when I am there they are always hanging onto us and trying to get our attention and we can't really have the full conversation we would like to. When I am there and Marv is there as well, he usually is posted on the couch with his phone doing whatever while Jill and I talk and hangout with the kids. Finally, we decided to plan one day a month where her and I can escape for a few hours so she can have truly adult time. Keep in mind that after his retail shifts, Marv will at least twice a week go hangout with his coworkers at their place or out at a bar.\n\nWell, the first day of our scheduled escape comes up and he is throwing a FIT about it. He knew it was happening, and that it meant he would have to be watching the kids for 3 hours, but still he is in meltdown over it. How it's not fair that she can just \"abandon\" the kids with him, and what if an emergency happens, that she just wants to leave the house so she can get hit on, and so on. He is saying that if we want to go anywhere, we have to take the kids. He even said \"take them to Chucky Cheese, they'll be preoccupied and you can have your adult talk\". Going to somewhere like that is a literal nightmare for me as I do not have nor want kids, but it's also not doing Jill any 'favors\" as the kids will need to be supervised anyway, and they'll be touring us around showing us everything they are doing. Very cute and I love it, but that's not the goal of the day.\n\nAnyway, I show up and we quickly get her into my car and we go the the bar that is within view of their backyard. It was close enough for her to be able to get home in 45 seconds if there was an emergency, but we got to have our much needed adult time. Now he's wigging out, saying I'm an asshole and that I am banned from being over there because I am trying to split up their marriage. Little does he know her and I talked a lot about ways that they can grow in their relationship and get some happiness.\n\nAnyway, was I an asshole for picking her up? With there being the insecurity issue in him, I do feel bad that he was experiencing that and I am left wondering if it was the wrong thing to do.\n\nFor some info: They have been married for 13 years, there has never been an instance of infidelity on either side, and if Jill were to flirt with someone while we were out I would absolutely be pissed off at her and give her an earful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:** Thank you all for your input - I feel better knowing that I didn't further the issue in their relationship and will be showing her these comments so far so that she can see just how off putting his behavior is. It tends to be hard when you've been married for so long to step back and see the behavior for what it is when it's clouded by a lot of 'context'.

I\u2019ll say it louder for those in the back: WATCHING CHILDREN THAT HE HELPED CREATE IS NOT BABYSITTING!! And if he is uncomfortable watching his own children, then in my head that means he should be doing in MORE, not less, so he can GET comfortable with taking care of his own children.\n\n3.

Either he\u2019s just straight up wants nothing to do with the kids, going so far as to suggest you take them to CHUCKY CHEESE, so he doesn\u2019t have to watch them (which speaks to the fact that he needs to be left alone with the kids MORE OFTEN), or he just doesn\u2019t like his wife upsetting the cushy gig he\u2019s got going, where he works, but has no other responsibility besides that. Whichever option it is, it doesn\u2019t bode well for her, and there needs to be some serious boundaries on her part if she doesn\u2019t want to slowly waste away, constantly pouring from an empty cup that no one else takes the time to refill.", "NTA.

Your friend needs to drop the dead weight. \n\nPeople who get married and have kids then act surprised when they have to contribute to said marriage and kids are truly some of the worst humanity has to offer.", "I went through this, and it got rough...  Friend of mine had a young child and a baby, around 2yrs. In the time she was with her bf (the father of the baby) she didnt go anywhere, was home all day with the baby and thats it. He worked and also hung out with friends, she just had a couple friends, incl me that would come over sometimes.\n\nBefore meeting him, she was my girls nite out buddy...we were total goofball, always went to places where there was always a bunch of people we knew, and wed get out on the dancefloor and be silly af, doing the sprinkler or the runningman, like we were total idiots. Theres no man ever who was like..wow thats hot LOL we were just out having all the fun.\n\nSo when she told me she really missed being able to just go out, have some fun, wanted a nite out I was like eff yeah lets goooo!!!! Her bf said all sorts of things familiar to what your friends hubby did.  When he brought up the whole meeting other guys thing, both of us were like..wtf? We literally had a reputation for taking girls nite to a whole nother levelo, nothing we did was in any effort to be attractive, and we didnt even notice anyone else, just super focused on having fun. And he knew this.\n\nSo yeah, I ended up kidnapping her, we were gone about 3-4hrs, and this was after the kids were in bed, so he didnt even have anything to do, just be in the house. But he called and texted her nonstop the entire nite, getting increasingly aggressive.  In the moment she was like eff him, but when it was time to go home, she was stressing hard and worried. To the point I promised to come in with her, and yeah he was threatening to take the kids and leave the country since she wants to wild out and not be a mom, hed have his mom take care of the kids.\n\nShe was a pretty quick thinker and right away gave her kids passport / birth certs to a family member, cause within a couple days, he blew up at her at he couldnt find it. Thats when she knew he was serious..and very freaked out.\n\nAnyway, long story cut short, in the end, found out when he was out, he was having his fun, and was fuming at the idea she wanted to go out to have the same kind of fun he was.  And yes, he was dead serious about leaving the country with the kids to take to his mom to take care of, then go off and live his own life...pretty much just to hurt my friend.  She got out, with both her kids, and he ended up getting deported for other reasons anyway. \n\nBig long story to say....that is very concerning behavior, and I reallly hope your friend sees it for what it is. Thats not love, thats not caring, thats not concern, thats incredibly selfish and gross and downright scary.", "NTA - he is controlling and insecure.", "Nta. Your the amazing kind of friend everyone needs. And he gets to hang out with his coworkers twice a week and he is complaining about her going out once a month? I say next time he goes she calls every five minutes because \u201chow can he abandon his children that way\u201d if he shuts his phone off have her drive over to the bar with the kids and say it\u2019s her turn for a break and then you can meet her at a different bar and have fun. Her husband is ridiculous. What is he going to do in case of an emergency? He is going to act like a parent and take care of it. If he doesn\u2019t know what to do at all it should be a wake up call that he needs to be more involved", "Nta.

His ass better get used to it! Keep doing this.\n\nAlso, small suggestion. When you're there with her and just the children...when I was growing up, we were taught to go play in our room/rooms. Being underfoot when adults were spending time talking was not where we needed to be. (A suggestion for your friend. Spending time playing in their room while you visit sometimes won't hurt them. She has a right to suggest they go play.)\n\nHer husband will either suck it up and get over it...or he can cry like a baby. Not her problem.\n\nHe gets time away, so should she.\n\nIf he doesn't trust her...has he been untrustworthy?\n\nAlso? Major red flag with him trying to ban you from their house.
