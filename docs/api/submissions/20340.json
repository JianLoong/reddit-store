{"id": 20340, "submission_id": "14gdwnl", "title": "AITA for 'kidnapping' my friend and leaving her husband with the kids?", "selftext": "We're all 35, and my (f) friend Jill and her husband Marv have 2 kids (6 and 11).\n\nJill works from home and Marv works at a retail job down the road. Recently, Jill and I have been trying to hangout more, but it's usually at their place while the kids are there. I love her kids, but it means that when I am there they are always hanging onto us and trying to get our attention and we can't really have the full conversation we would like to. When I am there and Marv is there as well, he usually is posted on the couch with his phone doing whatever while Jill and I talk and hangout with the kids. Finally, we decided to plan one day a month where her and I can escape for a few hours so she can have truly adult time. Keep in mind that after his retail shifts, Marv will at least twice a week go hangout with his coworkers at their place or out at a bar.\n\nWell, the first day of our scheduled escape comes up and he is throwing a FIT about it. He knew it was happening, and that it meant he would have to be watching the kids for 3 hours, but still he is in meltdown over it. How it's not fair that she can just \"abandon\" the kids with him, and what if an emergency happens, that she just wants to leave the house so she can get hit on, and so on. He is saying that if we want to go anywhere, we have to take the kids. He even said \"take them to Chucky Cheese, they'll be preoccupied and you can have your adult talk\". Going to somewhere like that is a literal nightmare for me as I do not have nor want kids, but it's also not doing Jill any 'favors\" as the kids will need to be supervised anyway, and they'll be touring us around showing us everything they are doing. Very cute and I love it, but that's not the goal of the day.\n\nAnyway, I show up and we quickly get her into my car and we go the the bar that is within view of their backyard. It was close enough for her to be able to get home in 45 seconds if there was an emergency, but we got to have our much needed adult time. Now he's wigging out, saying I'm an asshole and that I am banned from being over there because I am trying to split up their marriage. Little does he know her and I talked a lot about ways that they can grow in their relationship and get some happiness.\n\nAnyway, was I an asshole for picking her up? With there being the insecurity issue in him, I do feel bad that he was experiencing that and I am left wondering if it was the wrong thing to do.\n\nFor some info: They have been married for 13 years, there has never been an instance of infidelity on either side, and if Jill were to flirt with someone while we were out I would absolutely be pissed off at her and give her an earful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:** Thank you all for your input - I feel better knowing that I didn't further the issue in their relationship and will be showing her these comments so far so that she can see just how off putting his behavior is. It tends to be hard when you've been married for so long to step back and see the behavior for what it is when it's clouded by a lot of 'context'.

It's time for his wife to tell him the same about his twice a week get outs. He should stay at home with kids or take them with him", "NTA. He is equally a parent to the children and it's totally fair to expect him to be a parent on his own for a few hours. Jill should get just as much \"kid free\" social time as he does!", "Three hours watching three kids. Tell him now he knows how his wife feels every day, 24 hours a day,  365 days a year.", "NTA, but Marv sure is.", "NTA - it sounds like she is a single mother with 4 kids at home!!!  Hubs needs to grow up and learn to parent his own kids for a few hours by himself.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t about you at all, but she needs to deal with his attempts to control her behavior. 3 hours with his own kids is not unreasonable. He\u2019s a parent, not a baby sitter.", "NTA. In fact, I would encourage my friend to leave an entitled, controlling person like Marv. I'd rather be divorced and live with someone who doesn't respect or trust me in any basic way.", "NTA - Her husband sucks", "NTA Marv seems to not understand that he\u2019s a parent and Jill is not \u201cthe parent\u201d. Jill should not have let him get into a sense of entitlement where he can treat her like this. Just awful.", "NTA. A 6 and 11 year old for 3 hours?  That's not a huge tall task for an adult that's been around kids.   Is he worried your going to seduce her and break them up?", "NTA. If Marv is that insecure after 13 years of faithful marriage that Jill can\u2019t go enjoy a girls\u2019 night out without thinking she\u2019ll cheat on him, then he needs therapy. If Marv is so inept after 11 years of fatherhood that 3 hours alone with the kids is too much for him, then he needs parenting classes. Those two things make Marv the asshole, but what really bothers me is his cavalier use of the word \u201cabandon.\u201d There aren\u2019t many things I can think of that are more manipulative than accusing a dedicated mother of abandoning her children to have three hours (once a month) to enjoy some relaxation outside the fishbowl of parenting. Honestly, it\u2019s a disgusting thing to say and do to one\u2019s partner. But then, unilaterally banning her friend from her home because his wife ignored his attempts at manipulating her into submission and isolation\u2026 that\u2019s beyond asshole status. That\u2019s some red-flag controlling behavior.", "NTA but your friends husband is", "NTA - He is being a baby.  Seriously - having the kids by himself for three hours is beyond his abilities?  Sorry, but if the father of the children thinks he cannot handle an emergency with his own kids during a three hour time span, he is an AH.
