My twin boys John and Jack\n(11) and my daughter Jane (9). Fake names of course.\n\nMy boys always had a strong sibling bond. They are inseparable, have the same interests and hobby's and are doing everything together. I love to see this but it has a nasty side effect. Their little sister gets often left out by them. Sometimes they offered her to join them but most of the time I had to remind them them that they have a sister and should include her. They always claim that they don't like doing, boring girl stuff, with her. I encouraged them to do the things she likes too and to switch between the stuff they like. But they refused to listen to me and started to shut out their sister completely. This is going on since three months. I started withholding pocket money and family activities. My husband was hesitant at first but I convinced him. Whenever the boys do something without Jane, I take her to the movies or to mini golf and ,boring, girl stuff. It was hurtful to do this fun activities without my sons but it is exactly what they do to their little sister. I tried to talk to them and to explain this but they refuse to listen to me. In the opposite, they started to be actively hostile towards their sister. They ridicule her hobbies, say mean stuff when she walks past them and push her away when she tries to talk to them.\n\nYesterday morning we sat at the Christmas tree and gave Jane her Christmas gifts. When the boys asked me for their gifts I told them that we don't have any presents for them. They thought I was kidding at first but when they realized that I was serious they froze. I told them that they will get presents once they start to treat their sister like a family member. They didn't say anything and went to their room. They only come out when their dad forces them to eat something.\n\nI feel horrible but at the same time I am so angry at my sons. My daughter is beyond sad. She asked me yesterday why her brothers hate her so much. My husband thinks I am an AH for playing favorites and ,thanked, me for ruining Christmas. But I will not stand by and watch as Jane gets bullied by her own brothers\n\nAITA?\n\nThe comments here from male teenagers are exactly the reason why I want my sons to spend time with their sister.

Yes, parenting is hard, really hard. But you don\u2019t teach love and sharing with punitive actions. Find yourself some parenting resources (counseling, classes, books, family therapy) and get some help to turn this around by coming from a place of love and encouragement. Once you and your husband get some help, then declare a blank slate and start over with your approach to your children.

It's totally normal for older brothers to only play occasionally with sisters. I was the oldest and only occasionally wanted to play with the younger brothers. They were only a year apart and often played together, leaving out the younger sister. \n\nYou have tried to force a relationship and also monetize it.  \"Be nice to your sister to get pocket money and gifts\" fosters resentment of her and the parents. If it works at all, it will be performative and fake, not a real closeness.\n\nIf you want your kids to do more together, it's your job to think up fun family things. \n\nYou've seriously messed up your family dynamics.

I agree with the commenter that your parenting strategy is: The beatings will continue until morale improves.\n\nThey don\u2019t want to do girl stuff. That is normal. Forcing the boys to include your daughter is not going to get your sons to like her more, in fact, quite the opposite. \n\nWhen your sons turn 18, move out, and you NEVER hear from them again - this is the moment your sons made the decision. \n\nI see you being completely dismissive and not taking in this feedback.\n\nKnow that your sons are already planning to cut you out of their lives.

Why was that not enough for you? My older brothers didn\u2019t always let me do things with them, and sometimes I felt left out.

They don't need to do everything together all the time. \n\nTime and attention from their mother and Christmas gifts shouldn't be dependent on them playing with their little sister and including her in everything.  \n\nYou could've used these mini golf and movie trips as family enrichment time to try to develop better relationships with the kids. Now, it has become a source of resentment that they aim at little sister. \n\nAnd no Christmas gifts over this nonsense?

YTA. This did not start out as \"bullying\". Not including their younger sister 100% of the time is not remotely \"bullying\". The mean comments and physically (?) pushing her away when she tries to interact should absolutely be addressed, but like pretty much everyone else here is saying - you basically created this situation, and I personally think there's a difference between bullying and \"siblings aren't always nice to each other\" anyway. \n\nWould it be nice if they included their sister more? Of course. But punishing to the extreme, and trying to force the issue is not the way to make that happen. You owe an apology to ALL of the kids.", "YTA. Siblings don\u2019t all have to play together. If they don\u2019t like the same things forcing them to do her stuff 1/2 time is just going to, and did, create animosity.

Boys and girls at that age typically have different interests and trying to force your sons to do everything with their sister is a bad idea. Shitting on them at Christmas is even worse.

Of course 11 year old boys don't want to do the same things as their sister all the time. They wouldn't want to do the same thing as a 9 year old brother either.

Your family comes together by the tree for a day of togetherness and bonding\u2026and you tell your sons nope, you\u2019re not wanted here. This could have been a great morning for sibling bonding (sharing new toys, picking out gifts for each other, being excited for each other), but now that\u2019s not an option. \n\nThey can watch their sister open all her presents signifying the interests they were punished for not enjoying, while they get nothing because their interests and wants were never important here.

So now you have associated punishment with the sister (which has been pointed out over and over) and what you wanted was for them to, on their own WANT to be with the sister. Tell me how you think associating hurtful actions will plant the seed of wanting to be inclusive? And you also just showed your daughter that you will side with her regardless of what is going on. Does her sister really WANT to play with the brothers or does she just want a friend around to do things with as she sees the brothers have? Does she really think they hate her or is this an idea you have planted in her head by saying that if they truly loved her they would include her? Did you plant the seed in her mind? I\u2019m thinking if you really sit down and think about it, in your quest to make the dynamic duo a trio, did you unintentionally put your fears and wants into their heads?

Misbehavior could be things like saying derogatory things about the outing or being disrespectful or cursing. Whatever it is. The consequences will be more powerful if the kids choose the consequences and you refer back to the contract. \n\nThen you set the example by leading and  going on these outings. Go to the ones your boys pick that you don't want. Go to the one that dad picks that you don't want. Show them how to behave by your own example. The family should do an outing together with the parents leading on a regular basis. Then your boys can also do things without their sister.

Another time, they gave me a frozen jelly bean, and i hurt my jaw... gosh they were tyrants, but my parents knew that i was a girl and my brothers didn't want to play barbies or dress up with me and me being included in the boys rough housing was also not a good thing, so my mum got me in activities with kids my age and I had a social circle and my mum would do things with me when my brother's hung out and would sometimes take the 3 of us on mutually enjoyable activities every weekend and each one of us would get a turn to pick the activity that week so it was an equal chance, and as we got older we bonded... we started hanging out as we got older and interests aligned. So congratulations. \n\nYou have officially broken any chance of your sons ever getting along with your daughter... instead of understanding that as brothers and, most importantly, twins, they would want their own space and at 11 they are growing and developing their own identities going into the teenage phase and instead of understanding that they are boys who are going into the awkward phase of life where they don't want their little sister around, you instead completely overlooked their feelings and punished them, made them feel like their feelings and wants don't matter. \n\nThey are 11 year old kids... they are little people with big feelings, and instead of letting them be siblings, you punished them in the most horrible way possible and ruined the most magical and happiest time in the world, most importantly you ruined the biggest relationship between a mother and her sons.\n\nSo, YTA... and I hope your daughter is willing to take care of you in your old age because if it's your boys, I see a nursing home in your future.", "YTA\n\nHoly smokes. You are killing any possible relationship between the kids. You are the reason why it has gotten to this stage. It will only get worse from here.

In their preteen minds this is going to turn into \"It's Jane's fault that we didnt get christmas gifts\" and \"mom loves Jane more than us\"\n\nIf you've got family dynamics that have gotten this messed up, PLEASE get family therapy. withholding spending money and gifts is not going to solve this. you have to work to figure out what is getting in the way of their bonding and how to help them be more connected. read some books about sibling rivalry and especially about twins with other siblings.  the twin bond is SO STRONG that it is very hard for other siblings to feel included. and in the preteen years kids are encouraged to think of things in very gendered ways and police each other's gender-coded experiences and hobbies so there is a lot of messaging that they should be pushing away friends or family members of a different gender, and judging each other (especially boys) if they do or like anything coded for a different gender than the one they are assigned. also, i understand you dont want jane to feel excluded but she shouldnt have to be included every time, as long as they arent mean about it. it's ok for them to want to do their own thing. likewise she should get to do her own thing sometimes too, like maybe having friends over without her brothers bothering them. \n\nmy recommendation (beyond therapy) is to have activities where you split the twins up to do different things, so that each one gets time with their sister without their brother there. ideally the other twin would be doing something else fun with the other parent so that no one is missing out-- it's just a chance for bonding time without the twin bond in competition. the bonus benefit here is the other twin gets special one on one time with the other parent. example: you, jack, and jane go mini golfing while your husband and john go bowling or out to john's favorite restaurant. then another time you john and jane do something and jack and your husband do something. then rotate so you are the one doing one on one time.", "Welp, that was an effective way to blow up your family.

It put them to the point they thought every woman was like the mother and they lost many relationships because of it. After therapy and pissing on her grave together(she died 2007). I can say they both are at a better place and they both still hate their sister because how mommy dearest pulled the favorite card. \nTheir therapists don't blame them for hating the sister and doesn't push either of them to make amends with the sister due to the childhood trauma flashbacks with her that could trigger them to relapse to drugs or alcohol. \nNo use in apologizing to them now, you done got them set up for hate for females, trust issues, and love bomb the first real relationship that they get because they don't know true love just the way to get away from home.", "YTA, and the worst part is, its only going to get worse for your daughter.", "Yta enough has been said on why.

I wonder how they treat people at school", "YTA YTA YTA. Get off your high horse. Siblings are supposed to be like that. At that age a 2 year gap is significant. They don't have the same interests and it's nothing to do with gender norms. It's the fact that your boys are mentally in a different space than their sister. To them, she's an annoying girl into baby things. You can't force a relationship, even if they're blood. You're punishing them by spoiling the girl. You're gonna end up with 2 resentful boys and 1 spoiled entitled brat who thinks just because her brothers shut her out then she can get whatever she wants.\n\nYou don't sound like you do any individualized activities with each of your *3* kids. I bet you mostly take your precious daughter out way more than the boys and the boys usually have to do things in tandem with each other.\n\nStop it. Give each kid individual attention. Then give the whole family quality time. You're the reason for the divide and you are sustaining it with your crap actions.", "Yta. You're handling all this terribly as is your husband. No you don't get kids nothing for Christmas and he should have found out what they were getting and stepped in. Get to family counselling You're making this situation worse and worse", "YTA. Not sure why you're calling out teen boy commenters, but I can assure you I'm a middle aged mother of 3. They are boys going into puberty and don't want a kid sister around all the time, it can be very normal. Ofcourse I'd encourage them to do things with her and try to do family things all together to help them bond, but what you did is the EXACT opposite. You treated them like they were nothing and that she was the queen of the house. No wonder they turned hostile instead of disinterested.  You drove a giant wedge between your kids, and a huge one between your boys and their parents. I feel sorry for them, they are kids for Christ sake. You're horrible and your husband is no better.  I seriously hope this is click bait..", "YTA\n\nWTH is wrong with you?!?!?!\n\nYOU created the entire hostile relationship they now have. You did. Not them. You have this fantasy in your head that your children will all get along and play happy games together and frolic in the moonlight with fireflies and giggle together. \nStop it. Stop! You are making them HATE each other. \n\n1) Twins DO have a special bond. You got lucky that they get along so well. Be Happy about that. \n\n2) Younger sisters are annoying ( speaking as a younger sister myself...I know)\n\n3) Them including her SOMETIMES is exactly what should be happening. They don't HAVE to include her in everything. She needs to find her OWN friends/play by herself/do what SHE likes. The only time I played with my 2 older brothers was when they needed a third person for a game. I was not mentally scarred by this. Yeah, it kinda sucked ...but I didn't depend on them for fun. \n\n4) You showing favoritism to your daughter is why they were bullying her. They're JEALOUS, and feel like you like her more. \n\nI hope you BEG those boys to forgive you. And I also hope they take their time to do so.", "YTA. I\u2019m nowhere near being a teenage boy so drop that as an excuse to justify your behavior. I\u2019m a mom with two college aged sons three years apart. They didn\u2019t get along well until the last few years because their interests were so different. Forcing your kids to be best friends is not productive and punishing the older two by ruining their Christmas probably ruined their relationship with you for years to come. Stop favoring your daughter. Let her have her own friends. You can attempt to mend things but they will never forget this.", "YTA. What are you doing here if you're going to see all feedback as teenage boys and dismiss it all? Did you just want to be right? Be validated? Grow up and accept the simple fact that you are the one creating these problems. You're being controlling, overcompensating, and now driving an even BIGGER wedge in between them. Just stop. Be an equally loving parent and stop hurting your boys.", "OMG, YTA. You\u2019re the worst bully in the family, and you\u2019ve ensured your sons will hate you and their sister. Honestly, how could your brain tell you this was good parenting? Do you make them call you \u201cMommy, dearest\u201d? This is the kind of thing that keeps therapists in business. You\u2019d better apologize to your sons and fix this right away. (That means getting them the gifts they should have gotten on Christmas.)", "So, I'm a 29 year old woman, not a male teenager... I definitely think YTA. I almost gasped aloud when I read this. Your whole family is upset and you can't seem to understand that it's because of you and not your sons.\n\nOF COURSE your 11-year-old boys are going to exclude their 9-year-old sister. They're entering the difficult pre-teen years and playing with a 9-year-old girl is the ultimate uncool thing in their eyes. The more you try to push them, the more distance you'll create between them and the more you'll make those boys resent their sister. You're hurting all three of your kids here.\n\nAlso, to sum up, you stole Christmas from two 11-year-old boys for behaving like typical boys of that age. Unless you left out some pretty crucial details about their actions, everything you described of them sounds pretty standard for boys who don't want to play with their little sister, not AT ALL the kind of behaviour you'd punish by excluding them from getting Christmas gifts. You've given them a memory they'll carry with them forever, and that's NOT something to be proud of. I hope you feel ashamed of yourself. Apologise to those kids and hold a do-over Christmas day for them with actual presents.", "YTA, massive one, too.\n\n There are 2 years between my little brother and me, I could not stand that child until we were older teens. Didn't mean I didn't love him, didn't I wouldn't beat people up that picked on him, what it did mean was that I didn't want to hang out with my little brother, even if he wanted to hang out with his big  sister. We got closer as older teens because we weren't forced together as kids. All you're gonna do is make your sons hate their sister.", "YTA. It's Christmas. Christmas is supposed to be a time off uncomplicated joy for kids, and you've just taken that away from your sons forever, because they'll never quite be able to trust that you'll do good things for them ever again.

You've got a lot of work to do to heal your relationship with your sons before they can work on their relationship with their sister.", "Well I'm not a male teenager. I'm a 34yo woman who grew up as the oldest of four kids. And I'm also saying YTA. Siblings don't always need to do everything together. And being forced to do the boring stuff with your younger sibling sucks. I also hated it when my mom pawned my youngest sister on us, snarling to \"include her too\". Include her how? She was literally 3yo. It's not a \"boys\" thing, it's a perfectly natural older sibling thing. You're being sexist towards your sons. And yes, women can be sexist towards men too. Anyway yeah, congratulations on ruining christmas. And your relationship with your sons. See you here in 7 years when you'll write a post about not understanding why they went NC with you.", "I am struggling to wrap my head around how you sincerely believe that denying Christmas presents to your sons is somehow going to convince them to  include their sister in their activities.\n\nYou are perpetuating the Golden Child and Scapegoat dynamic in your own family.  Look it up if you don\u2019t believe me.  Your \u201cprecious daughter\u201d is so special and perfect and left out of everything with them, and your response is to punish them for being normal 11-year-old boys who, surprise surprise, don\u2019t want to spend every moment with their little sister.\n\nYikes.\n\nBy your own admission, they would sometimes include her in their activities.  THAT\u2019S A WIN, LADY!  Seriously, are you an only chid?  I ask because in every multi-child family that I have known throughout my life, siblings do not choose to do EVERYTHING with their siblings.  The fact that you believe that your sons should let your daughter tag along with every single activity that they do makes me think you have zero personal experience with sibling dynamics.\n\nYou crush your sons every time you punish them for not including their sister.  Mom takes Lil Sis to mini golf?  \u201cMom hates us and only loves Sis.\u201d  Mom takes Sis to movies? \u201cMom hates us and only loves Sis.\u201d\n\nMom doesn\u2019t give us any presents at all for Christmas because she believes we are awful people for not including Sis in everything?  \u201cMOM HATES US AND ONLY LOVES SIS!!!!!\u201d\n\nOf COURSE the twins resent their sister!  Their own mother makes them feel terrible for not doing everything Little Miss Perfect wants to do!  \n\nInstead of being happy when they do include their sister, you focus on being angry when they don\u2019t.  Instead of explaining to your daughter that her brothers like to do \u201cbrother things\u201d and that she needs to think of ways to entertain herself when that happens, you punish the boys and make things between the siblings SO MUCH WORSE!\n\nPlease PLEASE consider counseling for yourself to figure out why you seem to always pick the Nuclear Option when handling what should be normal sibling behavior. Parenting classes would be a great thing to start, too, to work on undoing the damage you have done.\n\nYour husband must be appalled at how you ruined Christmas for the entire family.  Even your daughter had to witness you being cruel to her brothers, and you used HER as your excuse!  That has GOT to mess with her head!\n\nYou are in jeopardy of losing your family, and that is not hyperbole.  If your husband is viewing this latest act of cruelty as a final straw, no one could blame him for considering divorce as a way to get the children into a loving, safe home.  \n\nYTA and I really hope that you get the help you so desperately need.", "YTA, So you are actively making them hate their sister. You are making her the golden child. 11 year old boys and 9 year old girls are not interested in much of the same things. You need to find things that they like that intersect and concentrate on those thing for them to do together. There is nothing wrong with them doing separate things also. So say daughter likes making slime, your boys like to play mario but all of them like to decorate cookies so now you have commonground so they can do together and stuff they can do apart. That is healthy.", "YTA. Im a women. And I didn't want my younger brother doing things with my friends. I do not understand why parents have multiple children and want them to all get along?

Not a teenage boy here, in fact I am a mom with twin boys who are 9. \n\nOne) Twins have a bond that non-twins will never understand. I watch in awe of my children and know they love each other more than me, their mother, and I am glad they have each other. \n\nTwo) They are 11 and she is 9. There is a huge difference in that age. To us adults it is only 2 years but at that age just 1 year is huge. My kids are totally different from 7 to 8 in likes, behavior and more. \n\nThree) forcing siblings to play together is always a terrible idea. It makes them hate each other. My mother forced to me to pay with my younger brother and until he reached an age where we liked some of the same stuff it did not go well. \n\nFour) No presents? Withholding allowance? Really? Do you know who they blame? Your daughter. Not you. \n\nFive) You just showed your sons that you love their daughter more. You just showed them you don't love them. \n\nI am always in shock at how some parents have favorites and treat the other kids terribly. You have 3 children. Not 1. Apologize to your sons. Tell them you made a mistake because you didn't realize how far you were going. Explain to your daughter they don't hate her but misplaced their anger on her. Give your kids their presents and give them a break. Hope they don't remember this their enter life.", "Yta your parenting is bad and you are raising dysfunctional children. They hate Jane because you are making them hate her. You need to step back and realize what you are doing isn\u2019t work. \n\nSounds like you should talk to a professional", "YTA, your twins and daughter are almost as far apart as my sister and I. when I was 11 and she was 8 we drifted apart a bit, I was more interested in Lego, minecraft, star wars, while she was still into stuffed animals and barbies. She wanted to do everything with me and I thought she was an annoying baby. it's perfectly normal for siblings' relationships to fluctuate as they age and hit developmental milestones, my sister and I drifted apart as I hit puberty and then as I evened out a bit hormonally she hit puberty, but once she hit about 15ish we got closer again. we play video games together pretty often and I was the first person she came out as Bi to. \n\nIt's not cool that your sons are mocking her interests and are being cruel to her, but you did kinda set it up. if it's anything like when my sister and I were around that age they think she's a bit of a baby, or they just don't have the same interests as her. bc you're forcing them to hang out with her they resent her. \n\nTo fix this I would recommend getting your sons their Xmas presents, and taking them out for a dinner at a place they choose. I would apologize for the no presents at Xmas, and explain *why* you did it, that you don't want Jane to feel left out, but in trying to make sure she was happy you made them sad. rn they probably feel like you hate their guts, and that's really hard on a kid. it's going to be hard to earn their trust back and fix things, it might be a good idea for everyone to talk with a therapist. you've screwed up, and you need to fix it.", "YTA and this will backfire BIG TIME. They are not going to think \"Let's be nice to Jane\", they're going to think \"We didn't get a single Christmas present because of Jane - and this is just a good reason to HATE JANE\".\n\nIf your sons are bullies, they clearly learned it from you. You're supposed to remedy that by demonstrating empathy,  not by horrible petty \"revenge\".", "I am a mother in my 40's, as a qualifier for this comment. YTA\n\nSo many parents can't differentiate between what their preference is, and what the rule should be for their kids. You don't set rules so that they follow  your every whim like robots. You set rules for their safety and the safety of others, to set them up for success, and their overall physical and mental health. Just because you would prefer they play more with their sister doesn't mean they're doing anything wrong only inviting her some of the time. It's perfectly understandable that children a couple of years apart and with different interests are not going to want to be together all the time. That's not bullying- that's setting healthy boundaries and allocating different chunks of time to fill different needs.\n\nObviously, you don't understand what bullying is. Having two brothers who are kind to you, and sometimes voluntarily spend time with you, but also like to spend time on their own is not bullying. The bullying started in response to your dictatorship, when you constantly made their sister the focal point of their anger at your treatment of them. Bullying is when a parent who has clearly screwed up can't admit it, and doesn't care anywhere near as much about mending the relationship between her kids and between her and her partner as much as she cares about being told she's right and obeyed without question. I mean, stop and look at your reactions here. If you truly believe that all of these people telling you that you're wrong are children, then as the adult you either ignore it or you address them the way an adult addresses children. Not you, though- you clapped back and insulted children because you couldn't come up with good justification for your actions.\n\nThey were already treating her like a family member. They stopped because of you. It sound like they cared about he in a normal way for their age before you stepped in. They stopped because of you. I don't know if you were just so traumatizingly unpopular in your own childhood that  any scenario which brings those feelings back causes you to lash out with a revenge-fantasy-hammer against the children who triggered you.  I don't know if you just always want a free babysitter, and are mad they don't do it every single day. I don't know if you just secretly hate your boys and were looking for an excuse to subjugate and hurt them.\n\nWhat I do know is you are about to tear your family apart with the belligerent ignorance with which you approach this situation, and given this last stunt, it may already be too late. You took the wrong approach with this, and when it didn't work you decided just to make your kids miserable in the hopes they'd eventually go through the motions just to stop the constant punishments.\n\nWhat's going to happen is your husband is going to see he has to make a choice between protecting his sons from your emotional and mental abuse and staying with you, and he will divorce you. Your sons will go to court with a laundry list of the ways in which you played favorites, were cruel to them over nothing, and damaged their mental health, and if the judge is smart their father will get full custody and you'll get supervised visitation. Then you will maybe be left with a daughter who will make her own life miserable because you have taught her to bully and strong-arm her way into friendship groups, and it's going to make her a bully with no social skills, and ex-husband who tells your whole friendship circle he had to leave you because you were abusing the kids mentally, and two sons who at 11 are smart enough to know know wrong you are, and who rightfully hate you for how you treated them.  Merry Christmas", "YTA. From an outsider perspective, you\u2019re definitely playing favourites with your daughter, and it\u2019s not doing her or your sons any favors.\n\nBoys and girls are socialized to have different interests. Forcing your sons to play with Barbie dolls will likely breed resentment at the very least, or open them up to bullying at the worst. \n\nInstead, allow them to play their own games regularly, but try to find some gender neutral things they can do together on weekends or in the evenings. Things like board games, swimming, badminton, frisbee, etc. \n\nI have a younger brother, and while my mum made us get along with each other, she never dictated what we did. Sometimes we just played separately in the same physical space. But over time, we did start absorbing each others interests naturally. My brother would play with my plushies, while I enjoyed building his model cars. \n\nYou can guide them, but you cannot force them or punish them. The way you did is just going to breed resentment for you and for their sister", "YTA\n>The comments here from male teenagers are exactly the reason why I want my sons to spend time with their sister. I don\u2019t want them to be like you.\n\nLady, I'm 55 and raised 3 well adjusted and solid adults, 2 sons and a daughter. All you've done is ensure that your sons will want little to do with either you or your daughter as they grow older. You should apologize to all 3 of them and then try to fix this mess you've made.", "YTA, this is NOT how you go about trying to get your kids to form a bond. They are going to resent their sister so much more from this stunt you pulled. Congratulations on driving that wedge deeper", "Adding on to all the YTA, you say that when the boys don't want to do things with their sister you take her out and spoil her. Have you ever done that with either of the boys individually? They may be twins, but they are individuals, and the only individual time you give is to your daughter. Do you ever ask her to join in their activities, or are they the only ones required to sacrifice their leisure time?\n\nSo, you alienate the boys, treat them as one person, punish them by spending solo time with their sister, then don't even get them Christmas presents. They likely feel like an add on to the mother-daughter relationship and not worthy, and understandably very resentful. \n\nYour children ALL deserve your time. If you want good, caring, family bonds from them you need to model this behaviour, show them that they are all worthy of your time and the sharing of family experiences. You might find that if you show them that they are loved and appreciated they may want to bond more. \n\nLike breeds like and you are showing your children that you have a clear favourite and its not your boys. It's not sufficient to say 'they are twins and have each other', they still need you, for a.little time to themselves. When they feel appreciated and loved in their family relationships they will be able to show the same with their sister. The problem is NOT with them. This resentment is of your own making and you have the perfect opportunity to change this.\n\nIf you have a home printer then make up 2 vouchers now, one for each boy, with their individual likes and on each give them a fixed date that you will be taking them to an activity that they love followed by a shopping trip to wherever suits their INDIVIDUAL preferences. You should not take the boys together, take them for ice cream, out everything on this voucher and follow through\n\n\nTell them you'd prefer they spent more time with sis but understand its difficult with the different things all 3 like, but that you'll make a new family rule to sit down once a month and plan a trip/activity (even just a lunch out) with all your kids individually. They get to choose amd it goes on the family calendar. Then, as a family you book 1 activity per month that they all like. Trampoline parks and a hotdog is great, it's easy, they're all around the same age so would enjoy it.\n\nEnjoy this time with ALL your kids because if tou don't change something the only one coming back to visit at Christmas in a few very short years will be your daughter.\n\nEdit to add if you feel you need to then print.out a single voucher for your daughter with one specified event (getting nails done for example depending on age, but absolutely make the heroes of the vouchers the experiences you will offer the boys and make theirs multiple trips to try and recover ypur lost time wirh them and the loss of trust).", "YTA - Those boys will hate their sister forever because of you.", "YTA. Older siblings don't always want to spend time with younger siblings, but instead of finding ways to bring them together naturally, you tried to force it, then when that didn't work, blatantly played favorites. It's wrong that your sons bully and exclude their sister, but you set the standard when you began bullying and excluding them, they just followed your bad example.\n\nWhile your daughter is asking you why her brothers hate her, did it occur to you to wonder if your sons are asking or have asked their father why you hate them?", "YTA \n\nI am an adult twin. My brother and I are closer than I can describe. We live in seperate cities, but we are in touch every single day.  We have a bond. \n\nSo do your son's.\n\nYou say that your boys  'claim' they don't like doing girly stuff. It's not a claim, they don't like it, and you have decided to invalidate their feelings. \n\nYou say that your children used to play together when they had mutual interests. That's how relationships work.\n\nYou finish by saying that every male opinion offered here is invalid because they grew up a bullies apparently. \n\nSo, your son's opinions don't matter, your husband's opinion doesn't matter, any males opinion is invalid because they are males? Does it ever cross your mind that we could actually be right? \n\nAll you have done is elevate your daughter's wants above everything else, and create a wedge between her and your son's that might never be repaired.\n\nYour only hope to correct this it to apologise to your son's for what you did to them, and then apologise to your daughter for making her brother's feel bad about being with her.\n\nIf you love your kids, you have some bridges to build. Stop acting unilaterally against your son's, and against the beat interests of your poor daughter.", "So, let's summarize your post. \"My kids got along fine until I started trying to force them to do things they didn't want to do, centered around one sibling. Now, they actively bully and hate on that sibling. I have since tripled down on punishing them centered around the third sibling, deliberately depriving them from the affection of us, their parents and treating them like outsiders in their own family. They now act like the outsiders I treat them as. What could I be doing wrong?\"\n\nYou do realize that siblings don't need to be the best of friends all throughout their years, especially as they start to become teenagers and get distracted by their own stuff right?

He resented me, and I spent the whole time KNOWING how much he resented me for it. Of course it meant that whatever we were forced to do was no fun for either of us. And all I could feel was embarrassed that he was only doing this under duress. \n\nIt took some time but we bonded naturally. There comes a time when that just happens, and you can look back on your arguments and when he only saw you as a bother with laughter. We are middle aged now and you'd never guess in a million years that he barely tolerated me when I was 9 and he was 11. We are buds, and would drop anything to help one another. \n\nIt would never have happened if my mom had done what you have done.

Two of them are the same age and have the same interests.  One is younger and has different interests.  You SHOULD have found things that they can do together.  Things that they are ALL interested in.  And build on that.  It is completely appropriate that your twins do not want to always include their younger sister.  And that they do not always want to do what she wants.  Your sons are going to hate you and your daughter if you don\u2019t put in some serious work to fix this.  And no, fixing it isn\u2019t forcing them to include her.  Take them all to play mini golf or go bowling.  Find a movie they will all like.", "Hope you have enough money to cover the therapy your kids are going to need. YTA", "I swear to fuck I've read this exact post before.", "YTA. They don\u2019t have to do things with their sister. They aren\u2019t bullying her in anyway, trust me I was bullied through high school. All you have managed to do is show them she is the golden/favorite child.", "YTA, OMG, major AH. Since you like to deflect, I am 40+ female with children of my own.\n\nYou created all the issues in your house and you may end up alone.", "Oh my gosh this is so clear cut. YTA.\n\n\"Sometimes they offered her to join them but most of the time I had to remind them them that they have a sister and should include her. They always claim that they don't like doing, boring girl stuff, with her.\"\n\nThis. Is. Normal. She. Was. Not. Being. Bullied.\n\nAre you jealous of their bond? Do you just prefer your girl to boys?\n\nYou took normal teenage behavior (no matter what the gender) and turned it into something so much bigger. Completely ruining Christmas, dunno how you gonna come back from that.\n\nAlso WTF the edit. A lot of us are ADULTS who actually have kids who love and respect us. Maybe you could learn something. But doubling down on your terrible behavior instead of having a loving and caring environment in your home...well, it's very clear why your boys feel like they are all alone, it's so wonderful they at least have each other.", "YTA. \n\nYou handled this all wrong. \n\nIn all honesty, there was nothing to handle. They don\u2019t have to include her in things. They\u2019re kids. This is normal. Not all siblings get along or want to hang out together. \n\nBut you actively choosing to spend time alone with one doing stuff was a poor parenting plan. \n\nThey\u2019re treating her worse because of your actions. You caused this. And then you have the audacity to punish them because you think they have to play with her all the time?\n\nGrow up.", "YTA\n\nI see your edit about teenage boys so let me say I'm 35M. You punished your boys for not spending as much time with their sister as *you* wanted them to. And their response (which is not totally unexpected for 11 year olds) was to treat their sister worse. In turn, you punished them worse. They treated her worse. And that vicious cycle (which you started) repeated until now their Christmas is ruined. \n\nWould it be nice if they wanted to hang out with their sister more? Of course. But trying to force the matter will only create bad feelings in the future. When they grow up, your sons won't remember any and all nice things you did for/with them, they're gonna remember how much you favored their sister and her feelings over theirs. They *might* forgive their sister later on but it's less likely they'll forgive you.", "You\u2019ve created an incredibly toxic situation and now you\u2019re punishing them for responding accordingly. JFC you need therapy or parenting classes. YTA.", "At least they have medical coverage for the therapy they gonna need from this still they turn 26\u2026 wtf is wrong with people.", "YTA and you need to realize that YOU created this issue. By forcing them to always include her and punishing them when they don\u2019t, ALL you did was cause them to resent her. They will NEVER forget or truly forgive you for what you did this Christmas. This will forever remain with them and will forever impact their relationships with both you and their sister. You need to get everyone in family therapy asap to have any chance of preventing this family fracturing further.", "Yta there have include her when there play together  but not anymore  there going to resent her even more", "You are going to hear about this for the rest of your life. If they even talk to you.", "YTA as an adult middle child who was bullied by my siblings, I can say you\u2019re absolutely making it worse. Being forced to do something together does NOT foster a good relationship. Especially at an age where they\u2019re experiencing such different things. \n\nGet yourself some therapy and maybe gentle/responsive parenting classes because you need to do better for all of them.", "There is so much to unpack here, and while I try to avoid blaming parents for their kid\u2019s behavior, unfortunately you are completely at fault here as their parent.\n\n1. Siblings will not always like and want to be around each other and that is not bullying. \n2. Twins not having the same bond with another sibling is not bullying.\n3. 11 year olds not wanting to hang out with a 9 year old is not bullying. \n\nWith that out of the way, being realistic there is 0 reasonable expectation for 2, 11 year old twin boys to know how to facilitate and maintain a relationship with their 9 year old sister who they don\u2019t share interests with. You set the bar so unreasonably high all they could do was fail. \n\nIt\u2019s your job to create an inclusive family, to teach respect and empathy and to create situations where your kids can spend time together where they all enjoy it. It\u2019s not on your kids to do that, they\u2019re kids they don\u2019t know how.\n\nI can understand punishment for outright mean behavior and actual bullying. But to take Christmas away it had better be something pretty damn serious and \u201cthey\u2019re preteens who don\u2019t want to hang out with a 3rd grader\u201d isn\u2019t that damn serious.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m also a 33 year old mother of an 11 year old girl and 9 year old boy who are actually best friends, even with my son being on the spectrum and needing serious behavioral supports. My kids are close because of the time I spend with them together doing fun things, and because I allow them to set boundaries with each other.", "YTA\n\nYou can't force them to spend time with her and you seriously made it worse.\n\nThey're just going to associate her with losing out on Christmas. They're young enough they'll likey will have negative feelings about here now even though you're the one that did it.\n\nCongratulations, you drove a wedge between them.\n\nAlso not a teen boy. My own kid is a legal adult now. Oldest of 5 kids. Believe it or not we've overall been close without some overbearing overreaction like you've done.", "As a women, not a \u201cteenage boy who you don\u2019t want your sons to end up like\u201d, you are the reason that they have become hostile towards their sister. It is NORMAL for older children to leave their younger siblings out. It is NORMAL for twins to have a closer bond and have similar interests and friend groups. It is NORMAL for them to want to be able to do their own thing without their little sister tagging alone. As somebody with a little sister, she was annoying as hell when we were growing up wanting to tag along with every single thing I did and we were only a year apart. You children are at different stages of growth. Your sons are older they are going to be interested in different things then your daughter. Forcing them to hang out with her is only straining the relationship more. You outwardly playing favourites is what escalated the situation. You giving your daughter your TIME is what made your sons resentful and misplaced their anger onto their sister. YOU taking away their things, not giving them their pocket money, etc and still giving it to their sister is what caused the rapid change in behaviour towards their sister. YOU are the problem. Your sons are reacting the only way they know how as young children who don\u2019t yet know how to properly communicate, regulate and handle their emotions. I would suggest family therapy for one because your sons are going to be mad and not at their sister once they realize who caused this and your husband already seems pissed. I would also like to point out that Christmas is a big deal to children and you did in fact just ruin theirs. You proved them right that their sister means more to you and that you do play favourites. \n\nYTA.", "YTA too\n\nI have nieces and nephews. One time my two nieces Fi (9), and Mea (7) were talking. They have a common interest and they decided to do girl talk, they were eating at the table and is beside R (6) who is a boy. Fi and Mea were talking about girly stuff and they decided to do some girl talk, which upset R thinking he is gonna get left behind and started crying. This would have been a perfect opportunity to tell R that sometimes people have a private convo and thats ok, but no the parents forced them to apologize to R and it basically started a resentment. They sometimes have a misplaced anger to R by secretly excluding him on playing time, etc. But sometimes they do play nice. The point is, some kids will have a unique bond, they are neutral to another kid but as OP said they were including their sister before until OP decided to stuck their nose. Imo the only time you should stuck your nose is when they are doing inappropriate or when the daughter or the son says they are uncomfortable with whatever activity it is.", "Also a good point, are we really sure that the 9yo girl *wants* to hang out with two 11yo boys all the time? I\u2019m gonna guess no.", "her edit is even more infuriating. Good god what an awful person. \nThose boys deserve a mom that actually loves them and gives a shit about THEM", "\"How dare my sons bully my daughter?!\" - OP while bullying her sons. Do you even like your sons, OP?", "This is an incredible answer", "I very much agree.  \nMy brother and I are almost exactly 18 mo apart, and almost exactly opposites. Our parents fostered unity between us. We'd go on outings that were either neutral or catered to our interests. We learned we shared similar interests, but in different flavors.   \nMy brother might monopolize the TV or video game consoles, but our parents would force us to compromise. My brother learned I could get him past puzzle levels, and I learned a lot about the mechanics of games.  \nAnd in the areas we absolutely did not mesh, our parents didn't force it.  \nI love my brother to death. We still aren't super close, but we have a solid sense of respect between us. Our parents ensured that.  \nOP failed her kids. The damage done at this point may well be irreparable.", "Well said. OP YTA and a big one at that. You showed your sons who your favorite is and they will never forget it.", "They didn\u2019t make op\u2019s little princess the center of their world. \ud83d\ude44", "My sister is two years younger than me and she always tried to force us to be friends as kids. I was supposed to include her in everything, which meant never doing anything she couldn't do, essentially forcing me to act two years younger than I was, putting me socially behind my peers. I didn't like my sister growing up. I always tried to escape from her. My mom would laugh and think it was cute as I was literally RUNNING away from her. \n\nTo this day, I have hangups about forced friendships and emotional intimacy from that. Ironically though, as soon as we were adults and out of our parents house and Mom was no longer trying to force us to be friends, we almost immediately became best friends and still are now. But that was very extenuating circumstances, and it was despite our mom, not because of her.", "Too late", "Bingo. This hits the nail on the head. You\u2019re punishing your sons for the AUDACITY that (gasp) 11 year old boys could be a little more resistant to the interests of a 9 year old girl. It\u2019s NATURAL at that age. And SPOILING YOUR DAUGHTER TO PUNISH YOUR SONS. That\u2019s just evil. Explain to us how it isn\u2019t and why they don\u2019t deserve to feel resentment because of it.", "In general, the OP can't reply to comments during 'contest mode' so that they can't influence the result.\n\nIt wouldn't help here.", "This no matter what op does to make this right(doubt she will since she has doubled down thinking where all teen age boys) but this is a memory the boys will never forget. They have essentially traumatized the boys and said their love was conditional on how they treated the little princesses.\n\n\nSince op has shown with out a doubt she knows nothing about raising teenage boys and what their normal behavior is I will add this.\n\n90 percent of teenage boys will not be on this site given you advise. \n\nMost of the people giving you advice are grandmothers and mothers. The occasional person on here that doesn\u2019t fall into that category is a person that is living the life of hell her 2 sons are! growing up with a golden child as a sibling.\n\nAlso if you think your boys avoid your daughter wait until her friends do because of the entitlement mentality you have instilled in her. Wait until she is crying because none of her classmates want her around. Too bad you won\u2019t be able to ruin their Christmas for not doing what your princess wants!", "I think the main thing is, *your kids will model your behavior*.\n\nIf you want kind kids, be kind to them and your spouse.\n\nIf you want inclusive kids, be inclusive. Op - you\u2019re teaching your kids it\u2019s fine to exclude people every time you exclude them.\n\nThe best way to improve their friendships would literally be quality family time and you\u2019re sabotaging that.\n\nThen buying only one kid presents??? Op, you put a massive target on her back. She looks like the Golden child and favorite, while they think you don\u2019t like them.\n\nApologize to your kids and buy them some gifts.\n\nEdit: don\u2019t forget to emphasize that this isn\u2019t Jane\u2019s fault. It\u2019s yours. Poor kid is going to have it worse because of your terrible parenting.", "It doesnt even seem that they were bullies before. Just normal sibling stuff. I'm an only child and even I know that siblings aren't best friends all the time", "No the sons definitely are. It's horrible being the one left out. I agree forcing them to do girly things to use the language in the post would be too far but they can make an effort to not excluded their own sister. If their sister says no, that's fine, carry on with what you're doing as you have tried. However, this post doesn't sound like any effort is bring made. And especially with the ridiculing and hostility described later in the post.", "It's like, she clearly wrote out \"when I tried to make the boys play games they didn't like but their sister did, they started avoiding her more\" and then...  just...  didn't let that sink in, at all.\n\nOP - where you went wrong was when you told the boys they had to play with their sister AND they had to do whatever she wanted.\n\nThe reality is that they might play together, when their interests overlap, and that's great...  but trying to make any kid, whether older boys, younger girls, older girls, younger boys, play a game or activity they have no interest in, is going to breed resentment between the children.\n\nIf you wanted them to play together you should have found activities they all wanted to do (maybe like that minigolf you only took your daughter to), and then they could have had fun together in an un-forced environment...  those times would have strengthened their relationship, and maybe they would have played together more at other times.\n\nI have two sons, a 5yo and an 8yo, and they play together often, but they also have separate interests, and when one or the other is doing something the other doesn't want to, they play separately.  You can't force different aged kids to always have common interests.  And I would never dream of telling one kid he HAD to do what the other one wanted...  they can negotiate if they want to play together or not, themselves."]}
