You mentioned Cora only visits you every other weekend, while Jada alternates entire weeks - therefore it just makes more sense that Cora would have the bigger room at the ex's brother's house.\n\nHaving said that, the brother responding \"good\" when you said you'd stop Jada going at all is still pretty AH behaviour, so you both suck.\n\nEdit: wow I've just read a few more of your comments... I hope this is a troll because if not I feel so sorry for your kids. Jada is definitely suffering from favoritism at BIL's house, but the way you talk about Cora (that she's talentless, has a room the size of a closet because you don't buy her anything, you treat her differently because of \"bad behaviour\") - it's gonna get to the point where she'll never speak to you again and quite frankly it'll be what you deserve.", "yta even if he does favor her nothing you can do about it be grateful, they are treating her well.", "YTA, not your house, not your decision", "YTA. \n\nReading your ridiculous replies to other people it is clear you\u2019re the problem. I\u2019d also hesitate a guess that you\u2019re favouring a child and pretty much projecting this with this argument. \n\nYour argument is Cora is younger and her stuff fits in a closet basically. That raises more questions than providing evidence to support your cause. Why does Cora have so little? Why does Jada have what appears multiple musical instruments? Does Cora have any? \n\nThe feeling you give is not a good one. And I\u2019d do some self reflection. You also have no say on how your ex parents or what his brother does in his house.", "YTA.\n\n>Told me what happens at that house is none of mg business\n\nPretty much this. What your ex's brother does in his own house IS none of your business. I honestly don\u2019t get the problem when Jada still has her own space and doesn\u2019t have to share a room. If Jada doesn\u2019t have an issue than why do you have such a problem with it? \n\nAfter reading some of your replies, I think you\u2019re the only one who is causing an issue. You\u2019re playing favorites yourself. You clearly favor one of your kids over the other; this is hypocritical on your part OP, especially if since you\u2019re accusing him of playing favorites and treating them unfairly.\n\nLmao, I read another one of your replies and it's obvious now that YOU are playing favorites. You see Jada as the golden child and Cora as the problem child. Wow, your replies are making you more and more TA. So you give Cora a room the size of closet and want her to have a really small room at her uncle's house? I see now why your ex's brother is giving Cora the basement, you make Cora take a closet size room and have Jada take the biggest room; however, since Cora is actually getting a bigger room instead of Jada that bothers you. OP, stop playing favorites\n\nEDIT: Your edit contradicts everything you said to multiple other comments OP. You\u2019re trying really hard to paint yourself as N T A", "How often do the kids visit? Did you ask the children about what their opinions were? Why do you expect the eldest to have the biggest room ?", "Jada is there 14% of the time (every other weekend).  Cora is there 50% of the time.  It\u2019s beyond absurd to expect the kid who visits twice a month to have the bigger room rather than the kid who lives there 50% of the time.  Even if they were splitting time evenly, Cora has a room the size of a closet at your house, so her getting the bigger room at her dad\u2019s house would be fair - they each get the better room at one house.\n\nI suspect that that \u201cgood\u201d response about Jada not coming over is because you\u2019ve made Jada a spoiled brat and she behaves badly when she\u2019s not treated as the golden child.  Which would make this one entirely YTA", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" As the oldest sibling Jada should get the bigger room\" .. so you have a golden child, and want THAT ONE to pe prefered. ONE has to get the bigger room, either one is equally fair.", "YTA. One of your comments talks about the kids' behaviour. You suggest that because a) Jada is older, b) Jada has more belongings, and c) Jada is better behaved, she deserves the biggest room.\n\nYou also say that Cora has barely any belongings, her room at your house is the size of a closet, and that she lives at her dad's house 12/14 days, where Jada spends every other week there.\n\nYour favouritism is blatant in your comment. You're rewarding good behaviour with belongings and living space. If Jada does not live with her dad full time and Cora does, why should Jada have the big room? Cora has to live in that room 24/7. How is it fair that Cora has two small rooms and Jada had two big rooms and lots of expensive things?\n\nYour ex hasn't said anything about Jada being adopted. She's got the smaller room because she doesn't live there.\n\nThe brother shouldn't have said \"good\" to Jada not living there, but he's probably sick of your sh*t. I'm betting that Jada is pretty spoiled (having a tantrum over a room at 17 years old) and Cora is used to being second best.\n\nI bet you wouldn't have intervened or suggested they share the room if it was Cora who was upset.\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to add that my younger sister and I have a similar age gap. I went to boarding school (by choice) when I was 10. I always let my sister pick the bedrooms first because I was only home for roughly 6 months of the year in total, while she was there full time. This started when we were 10 and 6. I moved home when we were 14 and 10. Then when we moved house, we discussed who was going to have which room. This is the same with your daughters. If Jada is there every other week, that's half the year total. Cora gets the bigger room.", "YTA. The person who spends more time there is getting the bigger room. Do you let other people make demands about what happens in your house?\n\n>Jada is very upset about this sitiation. \n\nIf Cora was upset, would you complain to him in that case as well?", "YTA \n\nMostly based on your comments. If you didn\u2019t want opinions on this that are different from yours, don\u2019t ask. \n\nIf Cora lives there most of the time of course it makes sense for her to have the bigger room that she\u2019s going to grow into pretty quickly where Jada is already 17 and likely will soon be around less AND is there less as it is.", "yta. who are you to dictate what the brother does in his house. boohoo Jada has a the smaller room at least she even gets a room.", "YTA. Stop trying to micromanage what happens in other people\u2019s home.", "YTA you do t get to dictate sleeping arrangements in someone else\u2019s home.", "YTA there is no rule that states the oldest child should get the bigger room. Jada may be going off to college soon and may be spending less time at their house. Why set her up in a bigger room if they may end up moving Cora there later.", "YTA families do things differently. In my family the smallest children get the big room so they have more room to play. Considering you are no longer a part of your ex\u2019s family you have absolutely no say in how they do things at their house. Both your daughters have their own room. You are claiming the current situation is favouritism yet you merely want to change it around. How is that not favouring your oldest? You\u2019re a hypocrite and you meddling in places you have no say does nothing but drive a wedge between Jada and her adopted family.\n\nEDIT to add: apparently Cora also spends more time at her dads than Jada does. Of course Cora gets the bigger room.", "YTA. You've got no say in what happens in his home. You could've opened the conversation, but you closed it off instead by immediately assuming the reasoning.   \nAlso, switching the room would be favouring Jada and keep the same issue in place, just for the other child. It's not a fix, even you pretend it is. \n\nWhy are you so sure that the blood relations is the reason for giving Cora the bigger room? Did you ask? Did you try to have a conversation instead of dictating what he should do?", "YTA\n\n Cora is his niece. Jada isn't. An the way you talk about cora is obvious why her dad and uncle protect her. I'm high fiving uncle for calling your bluff when you \"threatened\" them that jade won't go to their house again \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23. Lol, that backfired on your entitled ass. You're a horrible mother for how you treat Cora and i'm happy for her having dad and uncle in her corner. You complain he favours one child, when you do the same? With the difference that you're a parent to both.", "YTA. Your ex BIL isn't the one responsible for providing her with housing. Don't bring other people into your disagreements with your ex.", "YTA. And I'm fairly sure the favoritism of Jada vs. Cora stems from the divorce since Cora is OP's ex husband's bio kid. Maybe Cora reminds OP too much of ex or maybe Cora is mad at OP for splitting up with her dad. Either way, Cora is getting the short of the stick because OP is not a great parent.", "From your comments, YTA!\n\nYou clearly favor Jada over Cora.\n\nCora obviously has the bigger room because she spends all her time at your BIL's house except four days a month while Jada is only there every other week.", "YTA, if you know that they are treating that baby girl poorly why are you trying to push her off on these people. This reads like she's been treated unfairly before. So it's like your just asking for her to be treated like a nuisance. As we all know you divorce wives, not kids. But it's clear that's not how your ex feels just based on his actions alone. You unfortunately need to have that very honest conversation with Jada about the TRUTH of what's going on. She's 17, almost an adult. She's deserves that. She deserves to know she's not welcome. Like her so called father is glad she may not be coming back.", "From you comments it\u2019s clear that you show extreme favoritism to Jada, and you\u2019re upset that this isn\u2019t carrying over to her uncle\u2019s house. And by your own admission, you\u2019re treating Cora really poorly at home and wish everyone else did the same. \n\nI\u2019m so glad Cora has escaped your nightmare house. Get ready to see even less of her as she gets older.", "YTA. This is NOT your house, and you DON'T get to micromanage what other people do in THEIR OWN lives. I get that you think you are trying to do the right thing for Jada, but you have no rights over the brother nor how your Ex parents HIS children in HIS home. If you don't like it, complain to your Ex or change the custody agreement. His brother can tell you to go suck a lemon, because you have no rights over him or his actions.", "You are favoring Jada at your house, this is wrong but you still do it. So your ex favors Cora at his house. This might be wrong but he still does if. So \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f you can\u2019t demand he change when you are doing the same thing. If not worse.

Nope if one child gets favourited at one parents house you even it out as best you can for the other child. Jada is old enough to understand her mom does not treat her and her sister the same and should understand why Cora gets the awesome room in a space Jada only lives at 14% whereas Cora lives there 50%.

The \u201cgood\u201d comment seems like either \u201cyay I won\u2019t have to see you as often\u201d or \u201cthank goodness because she is difficult when she\u2019s over here because of the sense of entitlement you\u2019ve instilled in her.\u201d Either way I\u2019m praying that the kids will be okay and you will come to realize that they\u2019re both your CHILDREN and it\u2019s really weird to be picking favorites and blasting about it on Reddit.", "Have you even seen with your own eyes exactly how small this \"smaller room\" is? \n\nAnd is it as small as a... closet?", " i mean you obviously favor Jada, so why are you surprised? the both of you are playing favorites", "Cora is his biological niece. of course he's going to favor her. is it right no butnhe doesn't owe op or her daughter a thing it's his house not her exes. she ants her daughter to have the big room her ex needs to get his own house", "I just want to address this directly: yes. I understand why family favoritism is an issue when it happens between parents and their kids. But aunts/uncles have their favorite nieces/nephews, and the other way around. Did you love all your aunts and uncles equally? Do you love all your nieces/nephews equally?\n\nYou think the preference is because Cora is biologically related to him and Jada isn't, but I'd wager it isn't actually that. Of one of my brothers' children, I favor the two who are adopted over the one who's actually biologically related to me because they're lovely. My niece who's biologically-related to me has a terrible personality, so it surprises no one that I don't like spending time with her.\n\nAgain, points for protectiveness over your child, but you can't expect that everyone other than you love your children equally.", "But you want him to favour Jada by giving her the bigger room\u2026", "You favor the other so why not?", "So it's ok that you favour Jada?", "Someone should!", "And it\u2019s ok that YOU favor your other daughter more?", "The living arrangements in that house are absolutely nothing to do with you\n\nYTA", "Oh yes, which is why I've been addressing her in other people's comments, so frustrating!", "I honestly get the same impression, lol. I have this sense that the uncle is trying to compensate for Cora's closet-size room in OP's house by giving her a whole basement in his house.", "I wondered why the eldest is apparently entitled to the bigger room?  Birth order shouldn't really dictate things like that.  I'm sure there are plenty of other considerations when choosing rooms.\n\nWhen we moved into our current house, we had kids who were too small to have an input into bedroom choice.  We chose, and the only effect birth order had was that we had twin toddlers, and we chose the rooms closest together for ease of bedtimes.", ">Tell me, if you had a family member live with you and they was older than Jada, would you give them the biggest room and have Jada take a smaller room?\n\nObviously she couldn't do that because of all her musical instruments /s. \n\nBesides the smallest room is for Cora because she's the \"youngest\" /s.", "No that's not true. It was just one example but he is always favoring Cora. Even at christmas the difference between the gifts is very obvious\n\nCora gets an expensive gift that she loves and Jada gets a cheap gift she doesn't even like", "Jada needs a bigger room. She has many things including her musical instruments\n\nCora hardly has anything. Her room at our home was the size of a clost and all her belongings could fit in there. What is she even gonna do with a whole basement?", "She doesn't need an entire basement\n\nHe could have given it to both", "Why do you only have your daughter every other weekend?", "No he can let them share the basement. It's bigg enough for both of them", "Yeah, the fact that she thinks it's okay that her younger child lives in a closet in her home . . . I mean, I kind of think that the uncle is trying to compensate for how poorly Cora is treated in OP's home.", "Of course I've seen it he used to be my BIL I've been in his house before\n\nIt's very small, can only fit a bed and dresser", "I agree. She also called her daughter talentless and said she misbehaves, so it's not looking good for their relationship in the future. Never mind her uncle and eldest daughter.", "Maybe he has to buy Cora better gifts because in your own words \u201cshe has very little\u201d. \n\nWhy? \n\nJada isn\u2019t even there half the time.", "The irony is that you show favouritism to your eldest daughter and can not even realise it. So your youngest has to have 2 small rooms in both homes while your oldest gets 2 big rooms? \n\nAlso. why does a teenager have very little belongings? \n\nYTA.", ">Cora hardly has anything. Her room at our home was the size of a clost and all her belongings could fit in there.\n\nWell, ain't that nice.\n\nYTA and thank goodness her uncle gave her an entire basement!", "You sound like you\u2019re favouring a child not the other way around.

Maybe she will fill it with stuff that she couldn't while she was living with you in her closet-sized bedroom? Not that it's any of your business what she does in her room in a house that isn't yours.\n\nIt makes sense for Cora and Jada to have the bigger bedrooms in the houses they spend the most time in.

With the difference that you should treat them equally, they're both your daughters.", "YTA based on your post and comments. Your are being hypocritical and clearly favour Jada. Why are you allowed to favour her but you ex isn\u2019t allowed to favour Cora?", "YTA and quite possibly the only one in this story. You sound abusive towards Cora and the fact she chose to live with her dad primarily is a huge sign. Don\u2019t worry though as soon as she\u2019s 18 you won\u2019t have to worry about it because she\u2019s going to go NC super fast so you can be alone with your golden child.", "Cora deserves her privacy. And going by how much you favor one child and filled her head with nonsense that she deserves everything for being older of the two, I won't be surprised if you've driven a wedge between the sisters and they don't get along.", "Jada also doesn\u2019t need more than a bedroom, she\u2019s literally only there every other weekend", "So your two teenage daughters don\u2019t deserve privacy at their dads house? So either Jada gets favoured or both gets punished? Your favouritism is showing hard core and I can see why Cora chooses to spend more time away from you than Jada does. It seems Cora desperately needs a safe space where she isn\u2019t being put down in favour of her big sister.", "Um, what if neither of them wants to share? I have to agree with the commenter, you DO want everyone else to favor Jada", "So the same size as Cora's closet bedroom in your house... so what's your problem, they BOTH have a big bedroom in their home base and a tiny one when they visit the other.\n\nYou want Cora to have tiny rooms in both houses, and Queen Jada to have big bedrooms in both?", "Isn't that similar to what Cora has at your home? So why is it suddenly bad for Jada?", "YTA. Who are you to find the arrangement is unfair? Did you pay for the house? Did you fork out the utilities bill? Did you contribute a single cent? It is his house. Not yours.", "Yeah, that reply was insane. So OP doesn't actually believe in equal treatment on principle, she just likes Jada more. Then she acts like it's a human right violation when Cora's uncle likes Cora more. LOL.", "She has very little becuase she doesn't have much talent and misbehaves a lot.

He sees how much you favor Jada over Cora\n\nAnd, if I had to guess, OP's behavior towards - and treatment of - Cora has rubbed off on Jada and can be seen in how Jada interacts with Cora. \n\nUncle is probably sick and tired of Cora being treated poorly by OP, and having to witness Jada treating Cora poorly in his house.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if part of the reason for the divorce was because hubby refused to continue allowing Cora to be treated like a second class citizen by OP.", "Ah so the issue is Jada is your golden child. \n\nIt\u2019s clear now. YTA.", "And there it is folks! The classic golden child/scapegoat scenario, remember to cross that off your bingo cards.", "Lmao you ARE playing favorites \ud83d\ude02.

Gift giving should have always been about equal between them.\n\nIt sounds like everything you\u2019re complaining about is your ex trying to balance out the difference in how you treat the girls.  Because you so severely favor the elder daughter, he tries to make it up to the younger daughter.", "What kind of parent says their own child doesn\u2019t possess much talent? Good God. YTA for this alone. You\u2019re an asshole for the other stuff too, but goddamn. Just. Goddamn.", "Or maybe you think she misbehaved because you hate her and find fault with everything she does. Or maybe she misbehaved because you treat her like crap. You're a bad parent and I'm glad Cora isn't subjected to your crap every day.", "So you are punishing Cora because she wouldn't be your trophy child? And yet you wonder why she is rude.", "Wow you\u2019re a massive C and a b! YTA OP", "Why do you give your older child more things? How is that not favoritism?", "This makes no sense whatsoever", "Well they are doing the same. And Cora NEEDS to feel love", "And so is your ex. \n\nWhy is it ok for you to treat them on their needs and behaviour, but not your ex and his brother", "Pretty much. I was thinking about it and rethinking OP's other replies. The only way I can see the Uncle being this way is he seen Jada's behavior towards Cora and he just got fed up with it. OP paints Jada as this perfect child who does no wrong and Cora as the talentless, problem child; I can\u2019t even imagine how Jada treats Cora at Uncle's house with how much favoritism is going on here", "LMAO, so glad u/junipercanuck coaxed it out of OP. Check!!!", "There is no goldenchild/scapegoat\n\nIf one child is talented, polite, nice and helps around the house while the other one is rude and doesn't do anything, treating them equally would only encourage more bad behaviour in her", ">The only way I can see the Uncle being this way is he seen Jada's behavior towards Cora and he just got fed up with it.\n\nI think so, too.\n\nHis 'good' reply when OP told him that Jada wasn't going to visit anymore seems unfair on the surface, but OP has clearly created a monster in Jada and I think her behaviour when she's at Uncle's house is too much for him to deal with. Plus it isn't his responsibility to fix OP's mess.\n\nI feel sorry for both girls, actually. Cora more so for obvious reasons, but Jada also for the fact that OP has brought her up to be a spoiled brat and that really isn't going to do any favours when she enters the adult world.", "Wonder why she is acting like that huh? Have you even tried to find out? Also, does she only act like that when she's visiting you?", "Ahaaa, so you DON'T believe in equal treatment then? \n\nWell, maybe Jada isn't so beloved at the uncle's house because of her behavior then.", ">talented\n\nYou keep repeating this word as though it is a reason to treat the girls differently and it's bizarre. It sounds to me as though you use Jada's 'talent' as something to hold against Cora and reward at her expense. Have you ever given Cora an opportunity to explore her interests and develop a hobby? \n\nI think you have pitted the girls against each other, and Cora's behaviour is a natural consequence of being made to feel inferior compared to Jada.", "Isn\u2019t this exactly a golden child and scapegoat situation? Have you considered Cora acts that way because she sees your blatant favoritism? I mean, who would behave after being put into a closet sized room? \n\nI have a question, how come Jada and Cora don\u2019t share the biggest room at your house?", "The behaviour of a child often has a point of origin. Why is Cora rude? Why won't she help around the house? Why do you feel comfortable making the difference in treatment between both girls so big? \n\nSounds like you're doing a lot of favouring one girl over the other and the uncle is trying to compensate for it.", "You're being a cartoonish evil mother, OP. If you don't want to end up with one spoiled daughter and the other going NC on you (and both hating the other), I would seriously suggest you get family therapy for the 3 of you, better if with the ex. The way you disaparage your younger child, and favor your older is dysfunctional. I can't say if it's overcompensation for being a stepchild, or because you have odd views on raising children. There's a reason why the younger misbehaves with you, we can all see why. You won't listen to posters here, fair enough, but you might with a therapist. Good luck.", "That's what I was thinking. It makes more sense especially with OP's other responses. After the other responses and reading that \"good\" reply, it makes more sense that he is ok with Jada not coming back and possibly being horrible to Cora", "O fcourse I tried to find out. I took her to a psychiatrist but she didn't say a single word and said she is planning to not say anything if I take her there again", "This right here", "YTA.

You are being ridiculous for no reason just to cause drama.", "YTA,  your ex bil is treating Jada better than you're treating Cora.  You don't like that your favourite isn't everyone's favourite. \n\nCoral is at bills house 24+ days a month. Jada is there 14 so yes Cora should have the bigger room as she spends mre time there.", "YTA \n\nAfter reading all of your comments, the truth finally comes out. Jada is your golden child, who in your words is talented and behaves & has the biggest room at your house because of that & that she\u2019s the oldest. Cora, according to you is talentless & misbehaved has a broom closet sized room.  And at your EX BIL house it isn\u2019t the fact that Cora has the big room & is there for most of the month (especially compared to how often Jada is there) is that Cora isn\u2019t forced to share the big room. You know that your ex & ex BIL won\u2019t give Jada the big room since she\u2019s hardly there but won\u2019t make Cora share it either. Jada can\u2019t get over the fact that for once in her life, Cora is treated as an EQUAL or in fact better. \n\nThat\u2019s why Cora only sees you a few times a month, not even going to say days since she just visits.
