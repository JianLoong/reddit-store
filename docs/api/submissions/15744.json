You spend hours off the clock meticulously going through everyone\u2019s desk in the building, create an itemized list, and then have circle time where you talk to grown-ass adult like 5-year-olds about the difference between sharing and taking?\n\nAt the end, do you also wipe their butts and explain how to wash their hands?", "Nta I hoped you replied back to each of them that you had reached out and also explained the flow on impact it was causing you, but no one bothered to admit to any of it or stop.  It got so bad the boss was present to view the flow on effect upon your working day, and you refused to take the hit on their behalf.  \n\nNo one but themselves are to blame for the fallout that occurred, that everyone is blaming you for their choice of behaviour in the office speaks volumes of them not getting the message.", "NTA. \n\nYOUR COO LITERALLY WITNESSED IT. YOU COULDNT JUST SAY \u201coh yeah this is just a fun game we play haha\u201d WHILE FUMING BECAUSE YOUR PERSONAL CUP GOT TAKEN (EW) AND YOUR CHAIR IS GONE. you lasted a lot longer than I would\u2019ve tbh", "ESH. People who work 95% remote shouldn\u2019t have an established workspace and should hotel.", "NTA. I\u2019m happy you found some of your stuff. People are vultures. I walked into my office on my first day in a new position to find that my coworkers had scavenged everything. The bookcase was gone, filing cabinet gone, no office chairs. The only thing they left was the plastic floor mat and the desk itself. Infuriating.", "NTA.  They raided your desk and took stuff.  That is an insane violation, they should be ashamed of themselves. Someone recently switched out my chair and I am so mad.  It totally affect my day.", "NTA well, my office certainly scavengers from desks. When people are working from home, it\u2019s never anything as personal as a chair or coffee mug. That\u2019s just too far. Grabbing a pen or stapler if you need one in a hurry? Fine just return it. But those personal items, no way. It\u2019s their own fault for taking things and not returning them.", "NTA. The guy stealing will probably lose his promotion because he was STEALING. The way your coworkers are treating you is not ok and you'd do well to stand up for yourself when they try to convince you otherwise. They're only mad they got caught.", "NTA. I literally laughed out loud when you said your chair was gone. Wtf. The audacity of these people?????", "NTA\n\nJeebus -- the supplies aren't locked up. They can walk their a-holes there.\n\nThey're mad they got caught.\n\nAnd they're stupid for stealing from the COO's direct staff. \n\nSounds like your boss has your back. If they complain to you again, suggest they discuss the issue with you and the COO, who actually made the complaint.", "NTA, we once had someone emailing the entire office asking who has taken her chair, it was hilarious to me because her office is on the other side of the country from me and most of the other staff so the majority of email recipients couldn't have taken it. But I understand her frustration. I have a favourite pen, if someone took it I'd be pretty mad too.", "NTA. This started out petty, but when it got as far as a cup with your name on it and your effin' chair, it became bullying and harassments, as well as an incredible lack of respect. Also, they were making you look incompetent and putting your job at risk. The COO did exactly what she should have done. That behavior is not what you want in a work place and it had to be handled.", "NTA. And your COO is how I roll....I'm petty or whatever enough to chase every single item down the entire office. They're all upset cause they got caught.", "How much you want to bet this was the entire point of it. They are pissed OP gets to work from home so much, so they swipe their stuff - escalating after the time they had to go and find a pen from a coworker while on a call to a senior person, thus making them look unprepared and disorganised - that was the whole point of the bullying.", "Well, to be fair, the boss is a C-Suite member, and she brought down the hammer. An axe epuld have been better.", "I think s/he had all the white dots at their desk.", "Wrong.\n\nThat's not the official policy here. \n\nOP gets an office because they get to choose to WFH or in the office.\n\nOP can decide to come in everyday starting tomorrow and the co-workers can choose to start WFH.\n\nIt's not your office.", "Heheh. Sacred \u201cground.\u201d", "I was thinking the same. I believe people will take advantage of you if they feel they can. \n\nMaybe you're not a people pleaser but very easy going and choosing your battles carefully. So when you finally did they were like \"yeah, whatever\" because they probably have never seen you act so assertive about something? \n\nProps to sticking up for yourself tho\n\nNTA", "I'm surprised no one was fired.", "NTA. You didn't ask for the office by office search. That was the COO. Meanwhile the person that had your mug should have been fired. It's already bad to take things that the office supplied (especially anything that was in the desk, locked it not), but that was an irreplaceable personal item with sentimental value. And it was clearly yours because your name was on it.\n\nThe pretty side of me thinks it would be funny to just walk into the offices of the people who think you were wrong and take their office supplies right in front of them without asking or even saying hi. Just...pluck the pen right from their fingers and take off without a word the next time you get berated for taking things too far. Obviously not a good idea, but worth a laugh to think about.", "\\*snorted laughter\\*", "The person who had all the white dotted office supplies is my guess.\n\nProbably should have just fired her/him.", "They are only miffed because they got caught and they don't like it.  When they denied taking stuff the first time did they expect you to believe the office supply fairy came through to pick up donations for a charity?  Would they feel any differently if you had personally gone through their stuff to reclaim yours?  Or would they have run to HR themselves to complain about you accusing them of stealing and going through their stuff?   The answer to that question is all you need to know.  You are NTA and stop letting them guilt you.", "Nuclear option would have been painting everything with a mild staph strain before going home.  Reeeeally easy to find out who's nicked your stuff after that!", "Agree. They\u2019re grown ass adults, you shouldn\u2019t have to ask more than once. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t have expected I\u2019d have to tell grown ass adults not to touch my stuff *but*.\n\nThey took your chair\u2026.SMH."]}
