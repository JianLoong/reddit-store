Their theft of your stuff made you look unprepared, caused multiple inconveniences, and oh yeah, it wasn\u2019t their stuff! (Particularly egregious: coffee cup with your name; your chair.). They\u2019re just pissed they got caught.", "NTA. Like you said, you tried to come to them personally and they lied to your face. They're only upset because they're facing consequences now for stealing your shit. They could have gone to the supply closet just like you did to get supplies instead of raiding your office, but they didn't. They took your personalized coffee mug for crying out loud, they're assholes.", "NTA. I can understand if this was just about pens or staples, not such a big deal, but they took your coffee mug and chair. That's targeted. They can play dumb all they want but they knew what they were doing.", "NTA. It is complete disrespect to take from your office without asking. If there is a supply closet or department then they are being lazy. \n\nAlso... your coffee mug? Oh no that is sacred territory. You never take someone's coffee mug. Honestly after that everything and anything is validated. \n\nAlso it's good to see your COO sticking up for you and setting a good standard. If they are upset. Good they deserve it.\n\nAlso if a guy loses a promotion. Great he didn't deserve it.", "NTA. You did not involve HR. That was the end result of the COO seeing the impact on your ability to perform duties.\n\nNot having a chair, a pen, a stapler on hand all impacts your ability to function in your role.\n\nNot having a coffee mug impacts your morale at the least.\n\nYou tried to resolve this. Not just once, but multiple times.\n\nThe COO gave this the attention it deserved.", "NTA. \n\nTaking without asking is theft. They don't want to get in trouble for stealing shit that doesn't belong to them? Then they should learn to ASK or you know put in a supply request like a damn adult. Just because you aren't in the office much doesn't mean its open season on your stuff.", "They fucked around and found out", "NTA.

You are definitely not the asshole, but I don't think your coworkers are going to stop disliking you over it unfortunately.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. The boss corrected a bad habit. Just as easy for them to go to the supply closet as it is for you.", "NTA.I'm so glad your COO put this circus to end. So stupid and disrespectful.

That's sacred ground.", "The weird thing is, is before this situation, I would have said I got along great with my floor coworkers. I've been working here for over a decade, and many of them have, too. They're nice people. Or at least they were? I don't know what happened to make them act this way. The only thing I can think of is my decision to stay remote, but we all video call constantly over Teams and they chose to come back, and could choose to go remote again if they wanted.", "Yeah, the pens I didn't - really - mind but it was annoying to constantly have to go grab a fresh one. The bigger things had me baffled. I think I went through a dozen staplers, and that's not an office supply that gets used up, so who was taking the dang staplers?? Who needs that many staplers?? Were they just sticking them in a filing cabinet like a dragon's hoard? They weren't going back to the supply cabinet so they were going somewhere.", "The supply cabinet is unlocked, and on the same floor. I don't understand why they'd want my partially used supplies, and not a fresh-out-of-the-Staples-box set of supplies.\n\nAnd I think my boss was just shocked to see me get upset. I'm told I'm very \"even keel\" when it comes to work stress. She's said before that she knows if things go sideways, I'm always a good person to turn to because I keep my head attached and let things slide off. I was on the verge of tears of frustration, I was so embarrassed and upset about it all.", "I was so upset about the coffee cup, too! I got that my first month with the company in a little hot cocoa basket our now-retired CFO personally made for me as a \"welcome to the team\" gift. It's just a mug, but it's something that's traveled with me for years from office to office, building to building through facility moves, and just always been there, you know?", "They don't want to be remote, but they don't want you to be remote either. They probably believe the whole \"office camaraderie = business success!\" thing so they agreed to come back in, and now you being remote is annoying. It says (to them) that you don't care enough about the company, them, and their brilliant water cooler conversations to be there in person. So they all made it a little joke amongst themselves to steal your shit and annoy you. They could have gone to the supply closet, but it was more amusing to take your stuff so they could have a laugh when you came in and got flustered about it.", "I wonder if someone got annoyed by your asking about the missing supplies for some weird, petty reason and thought it would be funny to keep taking extra stuff, like the chair. A dragon hoard of staplers would explain how one particular person ended up getting written up.", "Some of my favorite keepsakes are my mugs. Anything else is replaceable *except* that mug. That crossed a line. It went personal. And I hope for your sake they never see a promotion.", "So, their theory is they rolled their asses into your office, rifled through your desk like it was the office supply closet, grabbed whatever wasn't bolted down... and you shouldn't have complained about that?", "I fully think it\u2019s this.\n\nThey don\u2019t want to be remote because reasons\u2026 but they also are bitter that OP has chosen to stay remote. This is their little retaliation for going against their hive mind, I guess.\n\nA little short sighted of them as OP\u2019s boss is the COO. They had to know if she (or he) couldn\u2019t do the jobs required by the COO there would be some discussion concerning why.\n\nWho would ever go into a coworker\u2019s office and take their mug and their chair?? Children, that\u2019s who\n\nOP is NTA.", "That's been my theory as to why one had a bigger punishment over the others, but I didn't ask about it. I just wanted them to stop, which it thankfully has.", "They're upset HR and an executive got involved. They believe we should have handled the issue privately among ourselves, and when I told them I'd tried that, their answers were basically: I hadn't tried hard enough to get my point across before \"taking the nuclear option\". Which is why I made this post. This event happened a few months ago. I tried to post about it then for advice, but hit the word limit and figured that was a sign to just let it go and didn't bother trying to shorten it, but we recently had an office \"Spring Cleaning\" day where we all came in, and people were still going on about it. Sometimes I don't pick up on social things, so figured I'd ask for internet opinions. My HR and boss said I did the right thing. But that doesn't exempt me from being an a-hole. Which led me back here.", "Please don\u2019t be manipulated by them thinking you\u2019ve ratted them out and you shouldn\u2019t have. Turn the tables around on them and call them out on their shit. \n\nThere are consequences to their shitty action. \n\nThey are whining because this guy might not get promoted now, but it\u2019s totally ok for you to potentially not get promoted because of their shit.

I bet they wouldn't do that to a coworker who had a reputation for not putting up with bullshit. The next time someone brings it up, you need to call them out and embarrass them for their entitlement. Personally I'd make a sarcastic apology for not lying to the COO to cover a thief's ass. Who are these people, and who raised to believe that stealing was acceptable!? Unbelievable. NTA", "Gosh, it's just horrible that coworkers got into trouble for stealing from your cubicle... and that instead of talking to them directly (um.  which,actually, you tried... but they played dumb...) you took the matter to higher-ups. \n\nGosh.
