It didn't work.\n\nThis freaked me out, and he said he thought his wife did it. I asked why she would, and he said she was mad at him. I called his wife, and she picked up. She said she was at work, but she would talk to me when she got back. I said she needed to come back with the new keys right away. She asked if her husband was there, and I said yes. She said not to let him in.\n\nI went out and bought new locks. I entered through the basement and unlocked the door for the husband and he helped me switch out the locks. I explained that the price of the new locks was coming out of their deposit, and he said he understood. I made copies of the keys and gave him a set and called the wife to tell her she could pick her set up from me and explained about the security deposit.\n\nShe flipped at me for letting the husband in and giving him keys. I explained that he is on the lease, and I was fulfilling a legal obligation. She said that was BS and I made a choice and it was a bad one. She called me out for being a woman who doesn't support other women. She said her husband cheated, and I was helping him escape consequences.\n\nI said I couldn't get involved in their marriage and reminded her to come pick up her keys. She called me a bitch and hung up. I asked my sister for input, and she also said I was an ass for helping out a cheater.

Not only did you have a legal obligation to provide access, but you're also supposed to have a key for access yourself if something happens, aren't you? Angry wife didn't mention anything about it to you or have a key for you, even though she shouldn't have changed the locks in the first place. There's other ways to deal with cheaters without breaking the law.", "NTA, he is on the lease. You do have a legal obligation. If it were something dangerous, she would have called the police, and gotten a restraining order. Then, you could change the locks and keep him out. Rightfully so, stay out of their marriage, document everything on case she does it again, and so you can charge for the locks. If in doubt, call the local police station for their advice (non emergency line) as well.", "NTA. \n\nSucks that he cheated but that\u2019s very much not your problem. \n\nYour sister is ignorant. I\u2019m pretty sure you actually do have a legal obligation and can\u2019t just lock out a legal tenant.", "NTA\nas you stated, he is on the lease, so he has access. Wife is TA here", "NTA, nothing that goes on between your neighbors/tenants is your business, now I could see if the husband or wife was abusive, but from a business point that\u2019s their own personal problems. Some may think different but personally to me it\u2019s best if you stay out of others personal lives.", "I'll add one more vote here. NTA.\n\nYou own the property. By changing the locks she was not only locking out her husband, but you as well. That's illegal. Their martial problems are not your issue. Make sure she understands that she can't change the locks again. I'm not a lawyer, but I'm pretty sure that what she did violated the terms of the rental agreement, and you could evict her/them if you so chose.\n\nTell her she needs to deal with her marital issues in ways that don't violate the rental agreement. Leave it at that. Don't take sides no matter how disgusted you may be with this man for cheating on his wife. You're legally in the right here.", "NTA, as a homeowner you have more of a duty to help out your Tennant and change your locks back than you have a need to be a woman supporting other women. Especially since she didn't even notify you of the situation beforehand (not that it would have made a difference as to whether she was in the right or not. The husband cheated. Is it shitty for the wife? Sure. Is it your problem? Nope. You handled things well OP.", "NTA\n\nThey're not your monkeys so their relationship is not your circus to run. If you're doing something you're legally obligated, you're only doing what you should.\n\nShe didn't give you notice before she changed the locks too, that's on her.", "NTA. Depending on the terms of the lease, she was in violation for changing the locks without informing you and providing you a copy of the key. This has nothing to do with not supporting other women. She didn\u2019t ask for support and she didn\u2019t inform you about what was going on.", "NTA\n\nYou were fulfilling your duties as a landlord and your tenant made substantial changes to your property without your knowledge or your consent.", "NTA. There marriage is not your business. If she wants to lock him out she should have spoke to you about it first.", "NTA, not even a little bit. Legally you did what you had to do. Women supporting women doesn't extend to committing illegal acts and sacrificing your livelihood.", "NTA You are legally obligated to give him a key since he\u2019s on the lease. Their marital troubles are just that: THEIR troubles. The wife should have notified you of her intent to change the locks, but even if she had, unless the husband had been arrested for violence against her and/or she had a restraining order in place, he would have been allowed to have a key. Husband can voluntarily leave the house and you can choose to let him out of the lease if he asks, but neither of you are required to do so. I understand the wife\u2019s anger and wanting him out, but she cannot lock out a tenant that\u2019s on the lease. She may have to suck it up and continue living with him for the remainder of the lease. Or she could choose to leave. Having solidarity with a woman doesn\u2019t really apply here.", "NTA. You are fulfilling the legal requirements as their landlord.", "NTA. You have legal obligations as a landlord. Maybe the only thing I would have done is tell the wife unless she brings the keys immediately, you would be changing the locks yourself and letting her husband have access.", "NTA\n\nIt varies from place to place but in a lot of places/states it is illegal for a tenant to change the locks without the owner's permission.\n\nEither way, as you were already thinking, as the landlord, it is not your place or responsibility to act as their marriage counselor or referee, and since he's on the lease, he is allowed to go in the house.\n\nNOTE:  If you don't already have it in your lease, next time you have a tenant sign a lease, include a clause saying that they cannot change the locks without your permission.  In a lot of places that is the law anyways, but it is good to have it in writing with their signature.", "NTA. No way she would bring her dirty laundry to a local Starbucks and expect it to be appropriate. If the husband cheated, then it's none of your business. As long as he is on the lease you are supposed (read obligated) to grant him access to said property. Where I live you can change the lock as a tenant but if one of the tenants needs access you have to provide it. I'd say chuck them both out in accordance to the rental agreement. This smells like drama you can do without from a mile away", "NTA. Gender or shared interests has nothing to do with who is right or wrong. It really did come down to who is on the lease.  If the wife had time to change the locks,  she has time to make sure you had a key (as the property owner).There should also be a discussion about the status of the lease, who will be responsible for future rent, who will be living there, and if she didn't have time for that discussion right away, she should have made arrangements. \n\nAs for special situations: you should support anyone who is a victim of abuse, including granting sole keyed access. In the absence of witnessing the abuse yourself, viewing a restraining order would work.  I'm going to presume there was nothing like this going on because you didn't mention anything like that. Just the cheating.", "NTA.  If she\u2019d said she was afraid of her husband or that he was abusive, that would be way different.  But cheating?  Not your business.", "NTA. They were both on the lease and no one showed you a court order barring him from entering the home. Pleas to the \"holy sisterhood\" are irrelevant.", "NTA\n\nShe can't change the locks on a home she doesn't own, and cheating on his wife isn't a legal reason to keep a tenant out of the residence. You were fulfilling your legal obligation. If you didn't, the husband could sue you. Even if she owned the home, I don't think she could do that if his name was on the deed. She needs to file for divorce, not mess with your property.", "NTA, but this sounds like a domestic issue that wasn\u2019t within your responsibilities as a landlord to remedy. You should have advised the husband to call the police.", "NTA. Both tenants have the right to access the property. Wife does not have the authority to change the locks on your property.\n\nIf she wants to prevent him from living in the home he is renting, she knows where to find the courthouse.", "NTA, unless there is a restraining order you cannot deny a lease holder access. You are picking sides, the one where you don't get sideways with rental laws.", "NTA.\n\nYou are not a marriage counselor.  You are not her girlfriend supporting her decisions.  You are her landlord, and you own the house AND the locks.  If he was abusive or otherwise breaking the law, you'd have been obligated to get the cops involved to remove him from the property.  Cheating might be smarmy, but it's not illegal, and doesn't out-vote your leasing agreement.\n\nYou did right, and need to continue doing so, and sticking with the letter of your lease agreement if they're both signatories to it.  They need to come to you to formally remove one of them from the lease, if someone is moving out and should not be given access to the property.\n\nAlso, when their lease is up, I'd non-renew both of them.  Anybody who is going to change the locks on a rental property and *not let their landlord know, or even know why when confronted by phone*, is going to end up a nightmare for you somehow, sooner or later.  Let them have their drama elsewhere.", ">\"She flipped at me for letting the husband in and giving him keys. I explained that he is on the lease, and I was fulfilling a legal obligation.\"  \n\nYep!  This right here. What she's doing is illegal.  You are completely within your rights as a landlord to protect your interests here.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, his name is on the lease period. If she didn't want him there, then divorce, break the lease with all penalties and go your separate ways. If you hadn't, you could have been sued and I'm sure the wife would have been 4 getting her cut from the lawsuit. If you have anything in the lease about keys, I would help her out by evicting them for breach of lease so she can leave and do what she do.", "NTA\n\nShe was asking you to get involved in a personal dispute. If the husband is on the lease, you were obligated to help him get into his home when she illegally changed the locks. That crap is between them. Not your circus, not your low down cheating monkeys.", "NTA\n\nAs you said, he's on the lease and you have a legal obligation.\n\nShe's not allowed to change the locks on the property without your consent. She broke the law, and I'm sure the tenent laws in your area would allow you to serve notice for them to vacate the premises.\n\nWhich you might wanna do if they're gonna make their marriage your problem like this.", "NTA at all. This is a business relationship. The only time I would even think you\u2019d have a defense to bend the rules would be if you saw abuse personally.", "NTA. You were doing your job. Fulfilling your landlord legal duties.\n\nIf she had disclosed that he had threatened violence, then calling the police would have been the thing to do. As awful as cheating may be, it doesn't affect a tenant's rights and the landlord is not required or even allowed to pick sides.", "NTA.  You have an obligation to both leasees.  They can work out their problems with a therapist, or get a divorce.  You don't have to help \"punish\" a cheater to support other women.", "NTA.  In fact most leases I've signed explicitly state that you are not to add or change locks without approval from the landlord/property manager and furnishing them with keys upon installation.  If both of their names are on the lease and you haven't been informed of a restraining order or other legal document / action that overrides the terms of the lease, then you are legally obligated to provide him with access to the apartment or conversely liable for providing him with compensation for lack of access to the dwelling.  \n\nPeople wonder why landlords are always so cranky, this nonsense is why.", "You're right.  Assuming you're in the U.S., if you denied access to him, you would be breaking Fair Housing laws. NTA.", "NTA. Like you said, he was on the lease and you are legally required to give him access to the unit. Whatever is going on between husband and wife is not your business. \n\nAlso, the wife had no legal right to change the locks. That's your property and if she had damaged anything in changing the locks, she'd be financially responsible.", "NTA this is a domestic dispute. You are only hearing one side of the argument (wife's). You are a neutral party. I would not get involved.  You don't know the truth of the situation.  \n\nThe wife should have notified you that the locks were changed.\n\nIf he is on the lease agreement, you are legally bound to give both parties a key.", "NTA. You are a landlord fulfilling your legal obligation. It doesn't sound like the woman was in physical danger so there were no mitigating circumstances that you needed to worry about.", "NTA.\n\nShe had no legal right to change the locks. She expects you to violate your contract to support her even though it is against your best interest, it isn't your problem, and it isn't your responsibility to support her in her actions. This is an example of toxic femininity.", "NTA \n\nYou didn't know the details, so how can anyone berate you for ' helping a cheater ' is beyond me, also, we don't know that's accurate. Not that it should be a factor. \n\nIs it included in the lease that your tenants were not allowed to change the lock without your prior consent? It's pretty standard for it to be included, in which case the wife broke the terms of her lease and is in the wrong regardless of their marital drama, which is none of your concern. You were only fulfilling your obligation as the husband's landlord.", "NTA. You need to protect yourself.

She's also very likely to destroy something in a fit of rage and I would advise to contact an attorney and see if you can get them out. She can't verbally abuse you over her choices in men and expect to have a working relationship. That's what this is, BUSINESS. This isn't the cops or marriage counseling.
