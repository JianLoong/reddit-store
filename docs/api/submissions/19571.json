{"id": 19571, "submission_id": "14745tv", "title": "AITA for asking a friend if she was happy about being pregnant?", "selftext": "I (23F) have been friends with \"Molly\" (23F) for twelve years. For the entire time I have known her, Molly has never liked kids. She and I have had conversations in the past about how neither of us wanted kids. I get that people can change their mind but our most recent discussion of this was like three months ago, when I told her that my sister was having another baby. Her actual response to the news was, \"ew, why would she ONE to begin with?\" That was essentially her attitude to children up until recently. \n\nAround three weeks ago she sent me a text that just said \"I'm pregnant\". No warning beforehand, no greeting like \"hey, I have big news\" or even an emoji to convey how she felt. Very direct. I didn't know if it was a panicked \"I'm pregnant\" and maybe needed support (which has happened in the past). So I asked how she felt about that. She replied after a while with \"happy, obviously!! Me and \"Mark\" (her boyfriend, 24) are only telling close family and friends atm.\" I was a bit shocked but congratulated her anyhow and said I'd take her out to lunch to celebrate.\n\nWell, we met up for lunch this week and unfortunately Mark couldn't come but another friend of hers, \"Emma\", came instead. Emma and I aren't that close. Molly only sent a text like ten minutes before we met that Emma was coming too. I didn't mind but throughout the whole lunch something seemed off about them, especially Molly. Like they kept sort of exchanging looks right in front of me and were showing each other things on their phone without showing me (which I didn't really care about but it felt very middle-school catty), and talking a lot about things that I either didn't know about or wasn't there for. I was kind of glad when the lunch was coming to end but Molly went to the bathroom before we left and it was just me and Emma sitting at the table. Like I said, we're not that close but I tried to make some small talk about how exciting it was that Molly was having a baby and that she seemed delighted. Emma then replied, \"well, obviously she is, not that you would know\" and I was just dumbfounded. I asked what she meant and she launched into a rant about how rude it was that I had asked how Molly felt about the pregnancy and that Molly was kind of pissed at me for it. I confronted Molly when she came back to the table and she just kind of shrugged. I didn't want to get into it in front of Emma so I  apologised but then told Molly that I would have appreciated her coming to me first if I had upset her. She sarcastically said, \"why else would I text you something like that if I wasn't happy?\" I reminded her that she has repeatedly told me how she dislikes kids and she said \"obviously not my own\" even though we've both discussed never wanting kids and reminded her what she said when I told her about my sister's pregnancy three months before. \n\nI left quickly after that and have been thinking about it non-stop since.

A text that just reads \"I'm pregnant\", given what you know about her opinion on kids, doesn't seem that happy at all. You asking how she felt about it is a totally valid question, not rude at all. She was the one being rude when commenting about your sister.", "NTA at 23 I pretty much always asked people how they felt about their pregnancy before I responded. Half the time they told me they were completely freaked out and it was an accident and they weren't sure what they were going to do. It's no teen pregnancy but it's still young especially in this economy", "NTA\n\nI think it's s a myth that women mostly feel happy about pregnancy. I have met many (including myself) that despite wanting to get pregnant felt scared and worried rather than happy. \n\nAsking how she felt was the most natural thing and her weird reaction would make me question how she really felt.", "NTA, it was the most normal thing to ask given the circumstances (not everyone is happy to be pregnant, and I think most of us were sometimes in a situation when an unexpected pregnancy would feel very disastrous. )  And you even didn't assume either way, you just ask \"how do you feel about that\"? \n\nShe and Emma are the AHs here.", "NTA. To text anyone flatly \u2018I\u2019m pregnant\u2019 without even exclamation points, smiley, \u2018isn\u2019t that an exciting surprise\u2019 seems odd, and considering her past remarks, certainly indicated a dubious reaction.  You simply and directly asked how she felt about it.  Considering you responded both appropriately and positively to her response by congratulating and wanting to take her out to celebrate, shows you are supportive and understood her change of heart because it was different now that it was her.\n\nThe way they talked about you obviously before lunch and both acted towards you during it, should indicate that unfortunately this friendship may be on the outs.  She will associate you with the reminder of her previous dismissive and frankly crappy attitude about your SISTER having had more than one child with immature \u2018ew\u2019.", "NTA. It was a reasonable question. I had a planned pregnancy and a friend of mine gave me a similar response- I took no offense. I actually found it thoughtful that she left space for whatever I was feeling. I have alao professionally run pregnancy tests for people, which I know is different than being a friend, but we are taught not to assume a response.", "NTA but people are allowed to change their mind at such things. I totally get why you were curious and confused about her new stance and her saying 'obviously' doesn't really make sense. Is it possible she's not an assertive person and easily influenced by others to the point where she only just agreed with your stance on children to keep the peace as it's a sensitive topic for some? I'm not sure but NTA for being curious and asking her.", "NTA I think asking how she felt was way more appropriate than just assuming.", "NTA.\nI would probably step back from her now, she\u2019s just given you a glimpse as to what she\u2019s going to be like from here on in. \nPregnancy makes women go feral. Well actually gives feral women an excuse to be awful. Hormones and all that. (What rubbish) \nAnd yes i am a woman. With children.\nGo live your best child free life.", "NTA\nShe'd be so adamant about hating kids, then just texts rather than talking to you, and doesn't include any emoji.... it makes sense that you wouldn't know if she was happy or not. \n\nIt's like if someone says, \"I'm getting divorced.\" My response is... \"Should I say 'I'm sorry,' or should I congratulate you?\"", "Heck, she could have at least put a happy face emoji in her text to give you a head's up!\n\nNTA", "NTA. I have also asked a friend \"Are we excited?\" when she told me about an unplanned pregnancy. There's nothing wrong with checking in to make sure you give the kind of support they need. That's just being a good friend.", "NTA\n\nPeople are irrational.", "NTA.  She's very immature and petty.", "NTA. You know your friends heart, but maybe \"are you happy about this?\" was interpreted wrong by her because you know her history of not wanting children, and she's having an internal struggle about this right now. It's different for some when pregnancy becomes real. And yes, it can be different when it's your own kid. I don't like children either, except for my own. The real AH is her friend, who thought it necessary to jump your ass about it at dinner.\n\nMaybe your approach could've been better, but her plain text message wasn't ideal either. She's going through a lot right now, so I'd just call ignore it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I really hate the expectation that you should automatically be over the moon when you find out you're pregnant.\n\nI've had an early miscarriage and while I would love nothing more than being a mother, it was an incredibly stressful time in my life topped with breathing giving me heartburn, a Roman candle shooting pain in my titty, anything but sprite and plain rice making me sick, and being so exhausted I was taking naps in my car during my breaks. Having my mom in one ear about being a Gramma again and my supposed best friend telling me to abort so we could have more fun that summer made me want to rip my hair out.
