She knew I made decent money but figures were never really discussed and she is more than aware of my frugal lifestyle. \n\nDespite this, I was always open that I do have a bit of money squirrelled away and when she wanted a new bathroom and the garden renovated during COVID, it was never a problem. I even paid off all the debts she had accrued on credit/store cards and a loan (~\u00a320k altogether) and spent another \u00a310k on our wedding so she clearly knew we weren't poor.\n\nThe issue in the title came recently. With the arrival of our child, my wife has been on maternity leave for a year and she's now making noises about becoming a SAHM\n\nAs she has been on maternity leave, a lot of her days involve going to various mother and baby groups.\n\nFriday night, the mothers had arranged a night out (dinner and cocktails) so my wife was out. It just so happens that one of the other mothers works for the accountancy firm who does my accounts. With a few drinks in them, they were speaking as part of the group and, in my wife's words, it went like this (W-wife, A-Accountant, G- the group);\n\nW - I don't want to go back to work and Lichtie said that while it might be a struggle, he thinks we can make it work\n\nA - What would be a struggle?\n\nW - Well, the finances will take a hit with me not earning\n\nA - I don't think it'll be a problem\n\nW - What do you mean?\n\nA - Well, your wages will be a drop in the ocean compared to his, no?\n\nW - Yeah, he earns more than me but it's not like he's a millionaire or anything\n\nA - Are you joking?\n\nW - What are you talking about?\n\nA - I've seen his accounts, he's minted\n\nG - Oh my god, how could he keep this from you???\n\nSo yesterday afternoon she relayed this conversation to me and wanted answers. I told her that I, while I didn't know exactly what my net worth, that on paper I would be a millionaire. I had to explain that it is tied up as equity.\n\nShe understood but said I was a dick for understating the level of our finances as it meant we had been skimping on things we didn't have to (like the wedding). She also showed me the whatsapp group she has with her friends and 75% say I was a dick with one of them saying she should divorce me!\n\nSo AITA?\n\nTL;DR I downplay our financial situation to my wife (partly because of her history of accruing debt), she finds out, her (and particularly her friends) say I am a dick.\n\nAs an aside, I will be having words with my accountant tomorrow morning.", "created_utc": 1679814552, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/122e4xg/aita_for_not_fully_disclosing_my_financial_status/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Should she have her own savings/investments separate from yours to allow her more independent decisions regarding spending and etc?  So far you have been allowed to be frugal on YOUR terms only.  Works great for you I am sure.  But you are in a partnership now, have a child and their future to protect, together so letting her in a bit more on the details shouldn't be a problem.  I don't think you two have adjusted yet to sharing responsibilities for major decisions yet.  And yup that was a shitty way for her to find out your net worth.
