You need to accept and understand that redemption after large wrongs like that is a process that involves continuous effort for a long time. Earning back lost trust takes time. And it takes you continuing to do the right thing even without positive feedback and reward.\n\nHim yelling at you may not be constructive, and I think you two need to get a mediator to work through problems in your relationship as they continue to come up, but his feelings are valid and it's not right for you to ask him to just magically stop having them (forget them) because \"you're different now\".", "YTA for expecting him to forgive and forget after only 6 months of sobriety. \n\n6 months is NOT very long if you\u2019re coming off an opiate addiction.\n\nI dealt with my brother\u2019s opiate addiction for years.  He was clean for 2 years once. Fell right back into it. \n\nOne thing I noticed is that its SO easy for him to not remember all the bad stuff. (A side effect of the opiates fogging your memory). And just wants to be rewarded for getting clean. He wants to be rewarded for doing what he was *supposed* to do. \n\nHe *so easily* forgets how much of a raging AH the opiates made him. He acts like it was just a personal struggle that had no effect on anyone else. Its insulting.\n\nYou blew 45k, you spent all that time *lying* straight to your husband. Lying. Thats the worst offense you can ever make in a relationship. Trust is the only currency in a relationship, and when its broken its REALLY hard to recover from. 6 months clean doesnt undo all the lying. \n\nAnd on top of that, i doubt you were a very nice person to deal with through all that. \n\nYou have very little to contribute to the partnership because of the continued mistakes you kept choosing to make over and over. \n\nThe best thing you can do is to continue acknowledging how your choices affected *his* life. What you put *him* through. \n\nFailing to acknowledge that indicates you are barely in the infancy of your sobriety.

Once you're talking a few years of good recovery, you have a right to feel like if they don't trust you, it's time to walk away, but not at a few months. \n\n(And he may never trust you again and that's the nature of addiction and recovery; some wrong are too great to be forgotten. Usually that's the end of the relationship, and that's not really either person's fault.)", "YTA\n\nIt's going to take YEARS to rebuild trust. You need support in your life where you can vent about how incredibly frustrating and hard it is for you because obviously you know your own mind. He doesn't know your mind.

A lot more time than it takes to break it. And a lot more effort.\n\nI would suggest that your husband look into his own recovery program like Nar-Anon or Al-Anon. Living with an addict can make the best, most loving people crazy, and peer support can be one of the best ways to learn how to cope and heal.\n\nYou don't say how long you have been clean, but you also don't tell us how long you were lying, \"blowing through\" money, or other self-centered behavior. You say yourself that you only started working a couple of months ago, so he's been carrying the whole weight of your finances for some time.\n\nFull disclosure - I am a recovering addict (22 years) and married to a recovering alcoholic (almost 60 days this time). I've been on both sides of this issue. It was hard for me to accept that I hurt other people as badly as I did, and it was REALLY hard for me to accept that my efforts at sobriety weren't as appreciated as I wanted them to be. But it's not my place to decide how hurt people were, and it's not up to me to dictate how and when they heal.\n\nAnd as the one who was lied to by a partner in active addiction, I have no way to communicate how devastating the constant lying can be. Every lie from someone I love, someone I used to trust tore a tiny bit of my soul apart. I knew when he was drunk. I knew where he hid the liquor bottles, I knew what the withdrawals from the bank account were for. And he would stand there and lie directly to my face, and treat me like the crazy one for calling out his lies. That HURTS. And after that much lying, we aren't inclined to believe \"the truth\" for a long time.\n\nEventually he will forgive. Sooner if he finds his own recovery or therapy. But he will never forget. And neither should you.", "YTA. No one is entitled to another person's forgiveness, ever. You don't get to demand forgiveness because by doing so, you are dismissing the pain you put your husband through. You haven't earned his trust again; it's too soon and he may not ever be able to give it to you. You need to focus on your sobriety and your job. Will your marriage survive? It may not. That's what happens when trust is broken. You have a chance, but it may be without him. You need to recognize that he gets to decide if he wants to keep trying to save this marriage. Again, focus on your sobriety and your job.", "Soft YTA. I applaud you for getting into treatment and for your positive attitude and also for working towards paying back at least some of what was supposed to be a future for both of you.\n\nHowever, I'm writing from the perspective of your SO. My ex-husband became addicted first to opioids after an injury and then when he couldn't get those from a physician moved onto hard drugs, ultimately meth. He went to rehab, his sobriety lasted a couple months and then the cycle started all over again. I put up with this for well over a year and ended up over 20k in debt between paying the part insurance didn't cover for rehab stints, and ultimately a lawyer for divorce ( because he ended up suing me for spousal support).\n\nI believe you are sincere, and I hope you continue with your sober path forward, and not to knock you down, but 2 months sobriety, for an addiction that sounds like it was pretty darn heavy,  isn't long. It's going to take a really long time to earn trust, a really long time. And, it's honestly going to have to be on your SO terms.", "YTA for expecting this of him so soon after your sobriety. You may be sober for the rest of your life, yes, but it's only been six months. He isn't likely to trust you after that short a time. It's generally accepted that however long you were actively addicted, it's going to take at least that long to build back damaged relationships and trust. If it takes longer, don't be surprised, but you can't force him to trust you again.", "YTA. You are never a *recovered* addict. You will always have to fight your addictions, although I do hope it will be easier for you now. But you aren't \"cured\" or \"over\" and addiction ever. \n\n*You blew up your relationship and he stayed*. That should be enough forgiveness for you. If you feel entitled to his trust then you don't deserve it. Nothing that you've done in the last six months could ever get *close* to earning back what you've lost. He *should* be planning and protecting himself from you.\n\nYou're lucky. If my partner spent a whole year lying to me and spent a fortune on drugs I'd never forgive them, let alone trust them 5 minutes later.", "YTA for sounding like you\u2019re (kind of) playing the victim card here. Addiction is a terrible battle. You blew through a *lot* of money and lied to his face. \n\nFirst, it\u2019s great you weren\u2019t forcibly dragged to rehab and only went once. But you don\u2019t get a gold star for choosing to stop a problem you were responsible for. It hasn\u2019t been that long, unfortunately. Staying with you and giving you another chance is a huge act of love on your husband\u2019s side. You need to focus on that instead of what you feel is lacking. \n\nHe has a right to be frustrated that he\u2019s had to carry a much larger load in your marriage than you have. Maybe he doesn\u2019t express that in the best way, but seriously, your outcome is better than the majority of married addicts.\n\nI suggest solo therapy and couples if you\u2019re not already doing so. And don\u2019t expect things to get any closer to \u201cnormal\u201d for at least another year or two. The worst thing you can do for your marriage is act like he\u2019s being unfair or you\u2019re being wronged. He may never fully trust you again, but he loves you and he stayed. That\u2019s an enormous gift you need to cherish.\n\nEdited to add: Congratulations on saving yourself. It\u2019s an amazing achievement. Don\u2019t let all the YTA comments weigh you down. It sounds like you needed the perspective, but you should hold your head high <3", ">I\u2019m focused and I feel I deserve a chance.\n\nYou're being given a chance.

I drank from age 20-34, now 37. For the last 4 years it was worse. I didn\u2019t need detox or a facility, but I went to a lot of therapy. For a good year or so, my wife (married 10 years now) would still check all over the house for hidden bottles or beers. She\u2019d randomly take sips of my soda (I loved pouring rum into my sodas), and check my receipts. \n\nMy thought process was that she had every right to do that since I lied so much about my drinking and being drunk around our kids. I even offered to buy a breathalyzer, let her smell my breath, or do any other checks she wanted. I offered to give her my debit card and just give me cash and bring home every receipt and match up every penny spent. I\u2019m lucky to still have her and my kids in my life. It\u2019s been 2.5 years since I drank, and she doesn\u2019t check me anymore. \n\nEveryone has a different time frame to trust again. Luckily, I maybe spent $2,000 a year on booze.

You should be thanking him for staying around and offering to give up any privacy at this point.", "I have both been an addict and - prior to that - in a relationship with an addict. NAH, but I think it\u2019s important to realise that as addicts we rarely have a full understanding of the damage we do to the people around us, particularly partners. Sometimes when we\u2019re in active addiction partners don\u2019t have the time or emotional space to be angry or resentful because they\u2019re too busy being scared or trying to keep the train on the tracks, ya know? So when we stop, all of those feelings are allowed to be given space to breathe and that\u2019s something they\u2019re entitled to.\n\nConversely (as an addict) it\u2019s incredibly disheartening to get sober and feel like it\u2019s almost brought on its own issues minus the escapism of your DOC. \n\nYou\u2019ve both been through a lot and both of your feelings are valid.

That's what I  would want to do anyway", "YTA, I started my career in drug and alcohol counseling. I know you were taught in rehab that it is going to take time for those you hurt to trust you again.  If you\u2019ve only been back to work for two months you are still newly in recovery. How far are you in your 12 steps? This is one of the consequences of your addiction. You can not force anyone or expect them to forgive and forget so easily. The only way to build that trust back is to continue to stay in recovery and move forward. Your actions speak louder than your words.

Your husband might find his way to forgiving you (and it seems like he's willing to try), but it doesn't seem like you're giving him enough time to do so. Just because you're ready to move on doesn't mean he has to. \n\nIf you can't figure it out for yourselves, I'd advice seeing someone.

There is a reason people in recovery have a hard time staying in relationships. You want to move forward as your new-and-improved self, but your husband withstood an entire year of abuse, stress, worry, anguish, and potentially some traumatic experiences. He has had to learn not to trust you in order to protect himself. The finances thing is frustrating because you can't undo what you've already done, and you have agreed to be partners in life through thick and thin.

Good for you for taking initiative and taking ownership over your own life.\n\nHowever, one thing that's true about addicts/former addicts is that they often relapse.  I'm not saying this to make you doubt yourself, or say that your work to get clean isn't worth it.  I'm not saying that you aren't being genuine.  I AM saying that your husband is not unreasonable when he says he doesn't trust you or that he isn't confident in your ability to stay clean.  This is especially true if you haven't been sober for very long.  Recovery is a journey.  It often does not always go in a straight line.  Many people have to make several attempts to do it before it finally sticks.\n\nI wish you the best of luck on your recovery journey.  <3\n\nEDIT: Changed my verdict to YTA.  He has to decide on his own when he's ready to forgive.  You can ask forgiveness, but you cannot expect it or demand it.  True repentance means accepting that you might not get forgiveness at all.", "YTA \n\nIt's very easy to want your husband's trust again when you're looking at it from your side of the addiction. You were addicted, then you got clean. Now you want a fresh start. For your husband, it's not that simple. Your addiction didn't just hurt you. It hurt him and your marriage.\n\nYou want to know what's going through his head? He's asking himself if you'll stay sober or if you'll relapse. He's wondering if he'll see the signs early enough to get you help you before things get really bad. He wants to know if you'll really build up your savings or if you'll use it to get high. He doesn't know if you're telling the truth about anything. Your husband is scared and angry. Accept that it's going to take more than 6 months to heal from everything. \n\nIf you're not in therapy, please seek it. No matter what happens in your marriage, it's very important that you ensure you have a healthy outlet for the lows of life. Otherwise, you risk losing all your progress.", "YTA Do you think you are the one only that has suffered?  You stole a huge amount of money from your marriage, was dishonest and who knows what else.  Did your rehab not educate you about the pain you have caused loved ones?  Husband may forgive but you caused damage, he has to protect himself.  He needs Narc Anon and you need to be realistic", "This might be unpopular, but it\u2019s my opinion. \n\nYTA - you\u2019ve been sober 6 months and you\u2019re looking for forgive and forget already? I\u2019m sorry, you cannot rebuild the trust lost or repair the damage done in such a short time. \n\nForgiveness, sure, I can see that. Anyone who is genuinely sorry deserves that. Forget? Literally never! It\u2019s an unfortunate consequence addicts face, but it\u2019s necessary. The people you\u2019ve hurt should never forget what you were like during active addiction. The percentage of people who relapse is quite high, your loved ones need to remember everything in order to spot any sign of relapse (heaven forbid). \n\nYou blew through $45k in a year and assumedly weren\u2019t contributing during rehab, of course your husband is angry. On top dealing with you as an addict he also had to shoulder the financial aspect of life. Are you able to snap back to normal right away? Of course not, that\u2019s completely unreasonable, but it\u2019s also completely unreasonable for you to expect your husband to pretend nothing happened. If it isn\u2019t already, couples and individual therapy should be a priority for you both. \n\nBest wishes on your recovery journey.", "Yeah, no.  First of all, I can guarentee your husband knew something was up.  He knew you were on something, but just not what, maybe.  I don't care what you say, there are always sign, and us sober ones always know.  Second is the fact that opiate addicts rarely remember the things they've done, or the hurt they caused while using.  Even if you THINK you were behaving normally, you weren't, and he knew it.  Sure he forgave you, as that was his choice, but you have no right to expect him to forget or even ask him to.  Especially after only 6 months sober.  That will not happen, and you are absolutely TA for even thinking he should.  You should have learned that in rehab, and if your choosing to ignore that part, you better start working on recovery again, from the beginning.", "YTA. You've only been sober for 6 months and newsflash the damage or your addiction has done is not automatically forgivable once you stop. \n\nI don't see you acknowledging the damage you did but rather are asking for forgiveness -erasure of your bad behaviour.", "YTA for expecting him to forget so quickly.  Work your program and give him time. He was more than patient with you.", "I am not sure this belongs on AITA reddit.\n\nHowever, you aren't owed anything. You broke his trust and trust is the hardest thing to get back. I don't think you realize how badly you messed up (I mean you do but don't at the same time). You think you can say \"I am clean so trust me\" and he will.\n\nIt is going to take more than six months to earn it back. Yes, you are going to have to fight for his trust.\n\nFor over a year, you had lied to him daily and that isn't something you can get back in six months. And you need to realize how much those lies hurt him. For an entire year, he lived with a stranger. An entire year you played him. For an entire year, you abused the relationship. Yes that is a strong word and I don't mean it in the usually sense. You didn't abuse him but you did the relationship. You batted the relationship.\n\nSo you can want trust but you don't get to be frustrated that he can't. Accept that.\n\nYTA", "YTA, you may think things are \u2018better\u2019 but that\u2019s because you were constantly checked out. \n\nYour husband had to deal w collateral damage EVERYWHERE for a long time ALONE.", "As a recovering addict myself yes YTA. You have to gain that trust back and it's going to take time to rebuild and his feelings are completely valid you caused him turmoil and that doesn't just go away because you got clean.", "YTA Are you certain you\u2019re not still addicted to opiates?  Expecting immediate forgiveness after blowing through $45k and being sober for all of 6 months sounds like your still in the throes of addiction.", "YTA.\n\nThere's a song by Tyler Childers about opiate addiction that has a great line:\n\n\"Keep in mind that a man's just as good as his word. It takes twice as long to build bridges you burn. And there's hurt you can cause time alone will not heal.\"\n\nMy spouse is a recovered alcoholic and has been sober for over a decade. He has absolutely no recollection of what an absolute jackass he was and the hurtful things he said and did. You probably don't have that recollection either. I get that you think six months is a long time, but for him, those wounds are still fresh. You both need therapy, and you need to give him time to trust you. You don't get to demand that he just trust you after what you did.", "It's not a chance you're wanting, it's a clean slate.  You have the chance to earn all the trust back now but it seems that's too much work for you.  It's one day at a time, and it will take at least as long as you were addicted to earn back everything, if not longer.  YTA for wanting forgive and forget.  Stay strong, stay true and it will get better.", "YTA. 6 months is not a long time. Come back in 5-10 years and ask the same question. The answer will be completely different.\n\nYou may have been through a lot but so has your husband. Put yourself in his shoes. He would feel betrayed. Trust can be lost very quickly and take a long time to get back.\n\nBest wishes for your journey.", "YTA, you need to earn the trust back. You 're tired of fighting after 2 months, think of how he feels he put up with your addiction for years. Dude is burnt tf out", "YTA for expecting your husband to forgive and forget. You absolutely deserve a chance but you also have to understand that your husband has a right to feel the way he feels.\n\nI am a drug and alcohol counselor and I always tell my clients that you can\u2019t expect your family to immediately have 100% trust in you when you first get sober and that any relationship you want to continue will take a lot of work to repair. Just like you are working on yourself, the relationship needs work to heal.\n\nMany people forget about the toll addiction takes on family members. They carry significant burdens along with the addict the love. He\u2019s got every right not to trust you, but that doesn\u2019t mean you stop trying. One day at a time, OP.\n\nEdit: for clarity", "YTA. \n\nYou think this was just one of the \"downs\"? Are you serious??? You're lucky he didn't leave you. You need therapy.", "Them heart emojis aren't making you look innocent", "YTA, as someone with an addiction, it can take forever for someone to forgive you for what you have done. My boyfriend of more than a year hasn\u2019t forgiven me and I am okay with that as it has only been about a year after relapsing months after getting together. It\u2019s a struggle and for you to just think he is going to forgive you after six months and him forgetting is crazy. It will take long for him to forgive and he will never forget how you have acted during your addiction, you forget most things you have done during that time but you are an asshole to those around you. Don\u2019t expect him to do anything and don\u2019t expect others to as well.", "YTA for the fact that you\u2019re trying to sort this out on Reddit instead of calling your sponsor. Seriously.

You got your shot at implicit trust and ruined it -- you have to work now. No, it's not easy to forgive and forget. You cannot change the past, but you can use it to inform the future.

You don\u2019t get to start at 0 you start deep, deep in the negative. The path back is very very long. You are still together and that\u2019s great.

He can\u2019t, for his sake or for yours.", "YTA you don't get to tell him to forgive and forget for your actions.\n6 months is nothing. You are barely sober and you expect everything to be the same before you fucked it all up. \n\nYou dont get to dictate to your husband or anyone else on how they perceive you or what they say to you. \n\nYou may have gotten sober but you still haven't accepted the consequences of your actions.\nJust becuase you are now focused. It doesn't matter. Your husband has had to deal with the aftermath of your actions and your lies.

You need to just accept that and keep showing up.", "YTA because you were cheating him, of time.  All the times you were high and he had to deal with the addiction you have. He listened to your lies for how long? And he is still with you. But for you that's not enough, you want the trust back. The trust you broke everyday when you were using. You need to realize it's never going to be the same relationship you had before and it shouldn't be. In the relationship you had you were lying, using opiates and burning through money. \nIt sounds like you are trying to move on from your addiction but, you can't expect the same relationship.", "A bit of misguided YTA, and this is coming from someone who just celebrated my 7th year of sobriety. Like you, I put myself into rehab when I realized I was out of control. I asked one of the family counselors what I could do to regain my husband\u2019s trust. She told me there was nothing I could say or do, because it would not be a quick fix. I needed to give him time, as much as it would take. It was five years before he told me he had forgiven me for all I had done during the height of my addiction. I understand being proud of being sober and wanting him to give you a chance, but what you may not grasp is that he is giving you a chance by staying with you. What you can do is focus on your recovery, because by proving you can stay sober and don\u2019t let behaviors you exhibited while you were in active addiction surface. Alcoholics call it being a dry drunk, but I\u2019m not sure of the term for us. Either way, some of those behaviors have a tendency to creep out.

You\u2019re living in fantasy land. \n\nAddicts are incredibly selfish arseholes. They lie, steal, whatever it takes to feed their addiction. And the ones they hurt most are those closest to them - family. \n\nI know it\u2019s hard for you to think about everything you did but I guarantee your husband remembers all of it. \n\n6 months is nothing.
