I get her reasoning and I know she is not a fan of Christmas and even less of the materialistic part of it, but I don\u2019t even expect her to get something expensive, it\u2019s just annoys me that she is not being thoughtful, is like when one person does all the work and the other one just slaps their name on it.

And I know $120 is a lot of money but for an adult who has a husband who sounds like he has a decent income based off of his gifts to her and Im going to assume they have a joint bank account... why is she acting like y'all need to split? This is cheap behavior in a bad way, beyond being financially responsible or \"against the materialistic part of Christmas\". Its cheap behavior that suggests she doesnt think your dad is worth that money and effort \nB) theres just a lack of care and effort on her part. Obviously your dad likes christmas, or at least giving nice gifts, and she cant even go through the effort of getting him a watch or a wallet or a tie? She sounds kind of mean. If she's so against the materialistic side of christmas she wouldnt try to piggy back on your gift. She just sounds lazy.", "NTA. Ur mom should just be grateful she is getting anything at all. U worked for ur money and u deserve to spend it how u want without having to share with her. Just give her a card or something lmao", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This isn't about what gifts the mom is receiving. The issue is that the mom has always let the OP claim that the gifts the mom bought for OP's dad were from both of them. This year OP went ahead and bought gifts for her dad, and the mom is asking her to treat them as a joint gift from both OP and the mom, as they've always given joint gifts (paid for by the mom, though) in the past.", "Part of giving gifts is putting in the effort.
