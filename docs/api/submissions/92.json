{"id": 92, "submission_id": "yhv89b", "title": "AITA for getting upset at my kid's dad and revoking weekends after he refuses to take her to the ER?", "selftext": "I (F24 custodial parent) have a 3 year old kid. She goes with her dad (M24 non-custodial parent) and his gf (F23) and 5 month old. He picks her up and they go to his gf's parent's house. Around 11:50am I get a call from her dad stating her lips are blue/purple and she is having difficulty breathing. I ask him to put his ear to her back and chest to see if she is wheezing and if it's tight and he confirms. He says again she's not breathing right. I urge him to rush to the ER and I will meet him there. He quickly asks if I can take her and I angrily say to him that he's wasting time and to go ASAP. I'm not there with my daughter. I don't know the severity. This could be life or death. 5 minutes goes by and I call him to let him know I'm leaving to meet him there. He tells me he's not taking her. I ask him why the fuck isn't he taking her. He then screams to the top of his lungs at me telling me his gf and her parents aren't letting him take her because he can bring back illnesses or respiratory problems from the ER and give them to the 5 month old. Meanwhile my kid could be fucking dying. So fuck my kid they only care about the blood related child. I couldn't believe he let them hold him back from getting her proper care. I was upset at how neglectful he was being. I met him halfway between our houses in the middle of the street. I grabbed her out of his tow and jumped back in rushing to the hospital. At first glance she looked fine and conscious just quiet and not moving much. No discoloration. Chest looks fine. But still she could've had those problems before I got her so I still rushed to the ER. So they inform me oxygen levels are perfect. Lungs are clear. MRI is perfect. No signs of physical struggles or even internal problems. My kid was perfectly fine and I am really grateful for that. Doctor's only explanation is she could've been eating something cold or was just really cold in their house. It just didn't make any sense to the doctor and I. But still very happy that she is okay. But I told my kid's dad that she is no longer allowed over there and if he wants to visit or spend time with her it will be under my roof although knowing him he probably won't. I can't trust him nor his gf and her family. Especially in life or death situations.  They obviously don't have my daughter's best interest at heart. Had this been a severe matter it could've gone totally left field. This isn't the first time I've had problems with them about my daughter. Recently the gf wanted my kid's dad to start having my daughter over less because she wanted him to pay more attention to her and his son. But it isn't my daughter's responsibility to how good of a partner and father his is to them. I told him that he has 2 kids and he has to learn how to juggle and adjust to his new life. So, am I the asshole for revoking her dad's visitation?\n\n**Update**\n\nSo I got advice that I should document with him the events through email and text and he's changing his story. He denying the wheezing confirmation and denying saying she was having breathing problem. But instead only that she was congested and lips were blue/purple. And that he is not accepting my terms about him only being able to see her at my house. He also completely avoided the fact that I pointed out his girlfriend and her family convinced him not to get her proper health care.", "created_utc": 1667175622, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhv89b/aita_for_getting_upset_at_my_kids_dad_and/", "score": 2135, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
