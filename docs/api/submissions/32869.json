Cousin has been living with us since she was three, after her parents passed away, and I love her dearly as my younger sister and I support her in many of her decisions, except for this marriage. \n\nI feel like my cousin is rushing into things and ignoring the fact that they're not financially stable. Neither of them has a job, and while she is in a PhD program, and they're living off some of her research funds, it is not enough to make a living. They are currently residing in an apartment that his parents are paying for. \n\nTo be fair, I never approved of their relationship, even when they were dating, and I haven't softened up on him yet. I've been vocal with her about wanting them to break up their relationship, now engagement. I find him obnoxious and rude, and he has made some unnecessary comments that still boil me. \n\nFor instance, whenever we invite them for dinner, he makes snarky remarks about my wife's traditional dishes, and no, we've never forced them to eat any of them; those were more for my wife than for them. But he compliments everything I make, even something as simple as coffee, and he keeps telling me that I'll make a good man happy one day. It's infuriating that my cousin just ignores this. \n\nHis disrespect for my marriage is the reason for this whole situation. With the wedding on the way, he introduced me to the other funder, his relative. We hit it off right away. We're close in age and share similar interests, so we bonded well. But I started to notice that my BIL was behaving peculiarly, like he would try to give us \"space\" to be alone with each other or give us hints that we are a natural couple. I had to tell the other person that I have a wife, and what he told me in return really shocked me to the core. BIL has been going around telling his family that I'm getting a divorce because my wife cheated. The sheer audacity of this man baffled me. I left and, without saying a word to anyone, withdrew my fund. After cooling down, I informed the couple, my wife, and my parents of what I had done and why. \n\nMy cousin called me crying and begging for the funds, but I told her no. If she can't afford a wedding, then don't have one. My BIL has resorted to calling me names and is getting his parents involved in it as well. \n\nMy parents are okay with it, as it is my money. But my wife, although she is angry with what BIL did, doesn't support my action. Whether I withdrew the fund or not, they will get married and stay family with us, so this would only cause a rift with my sister.

Maybe he\u2019ll pressure sister to find a job so he can leech off her properly and she\u2019ll slowly see him for who he is. We don\u2019t know.

That\u2019s not a person you or your wife can safely be around, and you have to protect your own home before you can protect anyone else. Your sister will need to come to her own conclusions about this man, and decide how high of a price she\u2019s willing to pay in order to be with him. If she ever decides to drop him, she can reach out to you. But until then, I\u2019d advise you to keep your distance, and stand firm in your decision to withdraw your money.
