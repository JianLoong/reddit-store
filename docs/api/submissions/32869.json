Neither of them has a job, and while she is in a PhD program, and they're living off some of her research funds, it is not enough to make a living. They are currently residing in an apartment that his parents are paying for. \n\nTo be fair, I never approved of their relationship, even when they were dating, and I haven't softened up on him yet. I've been vocal with her about wanting them to break up their relationship, now engagement. I find him obnoxious and rude, and he has made some unnecessary comments that still boil me. \n\nFor instance, whenever we invite them for dinner, he makes snarky remarks about my wife's traditional dishes, and no, we've never forced them to eat any of them; those were more for my wife than for them. But he compliments everything I make, even something as simple as coffee, and he keeps telling me that I'll make a good man happy one day. It's infuriating that my cousin just ignores this. \n\nHis disrespect for my marriage is the reason for this whole situation. With the wedding on the way, he introduced me to the other funder, his relative. We hit it off right away. We're close in age and share similar interests, so we bonded well. But I started to notice that my BIL was behaving peculiarly, like he would try to give us \"space\" to be alone with each other or give us hints that we are a natural couple. I had to tell the other person that I have a wife, and what he told me in return really shocked me to the core. BIL has been going around telling his family that I'm getting a divorce because my wife cheated. The sheer audacity of this man baffled me. I left and, without saying a word to anyone, withdrew my fund.

If she can't afford a wedding, then don't have one. My BIL has resorted to calling me names and is getting his parents involved in it as well. \n\nMy parents are okay with it, as it is my money. But my wife, although she is angry with what BIL did, doesn't support my action. Whether I withdrew the fund or not, they will get married and stay family with us, so this would only cause a rift with my sister.
