You girlfriend has to account for materials.\n2. You girlfriend has to account for time to design the dice.\n3. Your girlfriend has to account for the time it takes to make the dice themselves.\n4. Your girlfriend has to account for time it takes to decorate the patterns.\n5. Your girlfriend needs to account for shipping costs.\n\nThese aren't mass produced. They are hand made. They are personal. There's more value in that. She's actually producing them herself and it's not a machine that can whip out hundreds in an hour.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you don't understand. Your girlfriend is an artist and relies on money from this. Players probably rely on her too. If other people want to spend money like that, what is it to you?\n\nDon't belittle your girlfriend.", "NTA.\n\nYou expressed surprise at how much people are willing to spend on a set of dice.

Good people say insensitive things, then realize it and atone.", "YTA. You may not be into this particular hobby or any hobby, but it's a common knowledge these days that hobbies are expensive, because they require unique, rare or high quality things. You're obviously on Internet, so you should have stumbled on this common knowledge a few times.\n\nAnd even if you somehow managed to honestly miss the memo, as a person with nerdy and \"childish\" hobby I can tell you that we hear so much crap about how we should not to spend (our own) money on things, that hearing anything, in any context, from anyone about  \"why does this (crap) cost so much\" is offensive af.\n\nNow, I don't know if your gf games, or just makes stuff, but I guarantee you she's heard it all billion times, and it got old for her before you got together.

So the price on those dice might not even be high enough.\n\nSo instead of praising her and being proud of her, you downplayed her work (even if unintentional).\n\nYou know what that means right?\nShe will no longer share such things with you, or be extremely reluctant, and most probably emotionally distance herself from you and look for someone else to give her the validation that she expected (and honestly deserves).\n\nYou completely fucked up.", "YTA\n\nWhy are you commenting if you allegedly don't care?

That was insulting.  \n\n\nI sell online. I do very well. I pretty much keep it to myself a I do not need or want backhanded compliments or insults.

Some ttrpg players can get VERY superstitious about their dice, or attach significance to the sets that may not make sense to you. My ex prefers long campaigns and would have a separate, personalized dice set for each PC he played. Like, he played a granny rogue and her primary weapon was a cast iron fry pan, so the dice set was made of cast iron. When I played a druid he got me a beautiful set of carved wood dice that I still have today, even though the campaign is over. I might use them for another character, but the character would have to fit the dice, if that makes sense. \n\nPeople are willing to spend a lot on the things that bring them joy.
