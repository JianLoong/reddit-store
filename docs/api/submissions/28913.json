Then you usually double that or sometimes triple that to get your retail price. You need to include pricing for new designs, new experimentations, upgrades to your equipment, as well as a wage to yourself.\n\nThe market is also hurt by people who do not charge enough, they just charge enough to buy more of their supplies so that they can keep up with their hobby.

And like, I like having a larger collection, so getting several sets generally appeals more to me than getting one set for the same amount of money. So, I'm definitely a quantity-over-quality guy, but I absolutely understand the reasoning behind the quality-over-quantity mentality - And that's absolutely the sort of mentality I'd expect someone who's buying custom/small-creator-made dice to have. They know full-well what it's gonna cost them, but by the gods, they want ***that*** set.\n\nSo yeah, I absolutely balk at the price of dice made by small craftspeople/makers. But I also know that they're priced that way for a reason - It takes a lot of labour to create those things by hand, plus the level of detail/complexity and customization available with custom-made/homemade dice is eons beyond what most mass-manufactured sets could have. If HD Dice were churning out sets as nice/intricate as what your girlfriend is, I have no doubt they'd be charging a hefty price for them too.\n\nAnd yes, dice aren't necessary (Maybe one appropriate set per game system, I suppose - But even then, games as a whole aren't a necessity). Multiple sets of dice aren't necessary. Fancy dice are especially unnecessary.\n\nBut, like, you don't collect things because they're necessary. You collect them because they bring you some level of joy.\n\nLike, if I were ever to really \"treat myself\" to a set of fancy dice, I'd probably look into opal dice - They're pricey, and you can't even actually really use them because you'd be afraid to wreck them. But man, they'd definitely be a neat showpiece for my collection/hoard.\n\nAnyway, yeah - You don't have to get deep into dice or dice-making or ttrpgs at all. But like, you should probably show a little bit of interest in your girlfriend's hobby/business. If only so that you understand the cursory stuff so that she can have a little bit of conversation with you from time to time about things she's proud of, things she's frustrated with, etc. So that she can talk about that part of her life with you, at least in some way.

I mean, what they're doing IS handmade art.  (The cheap dice sets, needless to say, are mass-manufactured.)  And a lot of them are phenomenally gorgeous.\n\nSo you don't HAVE to pay $100 for a set of D&D dice.  That's not \"what they cost\", in the general sense.\n\nThere's just lots of adults in the hobby, with disposable income, and they like the idea of having a set of dice that are handmade and truly works of art.\n\nI imagine that's partly what surprised OP. Because he's thinking of it as \"buying dice for a game\", and you wouldn't expect kids to have to pay that much for a game, right? Especially if you haven't thought about it much, and you're remembering how much games cost when you were a kid (not today).  (I'm leaving aside how much games for kids can cost!  I think if you aren't buying stuff for kids, you don't realize it. But that's another discussion!)\n\nIf OP isn't into table-top RPG, then he may not have thought about how this is a hobby with a lot of adults, who CAN pay more; and who are willing to pay more for something unique, rather than mass-produced.  The 12 year old kid who's just starting out can still get the $15 set of dice for starters.

OP didn't know how much ANYONE'S handmade dice cost.

To someone who has never heard of or seen disc golf, that sounds insane lol", "Yeah, and it's also true that often we say something, and then realize a better way to say it in hindsight.  But that doesn't fix the fact that what came out in the moment was less than ideal.  (This isn't meant to further knock you; I think it's happened to all of us at one time or another!)\n\nHopefully this thread will give you some ideas of how to talk to her and tell her that it was more about not realizing that when adults who do tabletop RPGs buy equipment for the game, sometimes they might buy something mass-produced and cheap, but sometimes they want to get something that's a handmade, unique work of art.  That's what your gf's dice are, a work of art, and that's what drives the price.  And this is a HUGE thing.  She is far from alone, at the moment, in producing handmade, small-batch dice, and commanding a price like that for them. (That's pretty standard, from what I've seen.)\n\nIf you've always just thought of dice as \"those things that come with a game when you need them to play it\", then you've thought of dice as cheap things; similar to basic playing cards.  And dice CAN be really cheap!  You can go get a basic RPG set for like $15.  They may even be kind of pretty!  But they're mass-produced.\n\nEven though you know your gf makes these by hand, you might have kind of failed to make the mental leap to the idea that \"this is art\".  Even things that are utilitarian can also be art -- that is, art can be used.  Small-batch, handmade art items always cost more.  And the materials to make this stuff aren't cheap, either!  (Big companies can afford to sell dice sets for cheap not only because of mass manufacture, but also because of costs at scale.)\n\nIt's okay that you didn't know all the ins and outs of this hobby.  Although, this might be a moment for you to decide to talk to your gf about this hobby / art of hers -- or, let her talk to you about it.  You may not be into RPG as a hobby yourself, but you can take an interest in the art that she produces, and learn at least a little about how what she makes fits into the context of the larger hobby.  Take an interest in what she enjoys doing! (It goes without saying that it would be nice for her to take some interest in what YOU enjoy doing, as well.  Couples don't have to like doing the same things!  But it brings you closer together if you let each other chat about your interests from time to time. You don't have to love each other's hobbies or get super into them.  But it's nice to know what your partner is doing, especially if it means a lot to them, and is a means of self-expression for them, and is something they're proud of.)\n\nI do want to mention one more factor here, which you might not have encountered before, and which your gf might find it hard to articulate. Anybody who makes any kind of art or craft, whether they're an amateur who sometimes sells their stuff, or a pro, has encountered the issue of a non-artist severely under-valuing their work.  This is a systemic problem.  It's not just YOU -- it's practically everyone.  So many artists know the feeling of family or friends asking them to do art for them (whether it's a painting or making a quilt or knitting a sweater or what have you), and then the artist quotes them a price that is often already a discount on the rates they could otherwise get, only to receive a shocked reaction.\n\nThe implication to artists is always that our work isn't worth that much... even though the person just said they WANT a piece of our work.  They just want it to be cheap. (Or free!)  There are a lot of societal factors that go into this -- it's really not just that everyone is trying to be rude as hell (although they ARE being rude as hell).  It's that society kind of trains people at every turn to devalue handmade work.   \n\nPartly it's because we live in a time when you CAN get a lot of decorative work (whether it's art or clothes or furniture etc.) for cheap. (Because of those economies of scale and mass production.)  So why should you pay $100, when you can go out and buy the same thing for $15?  But the thing you'd buy for $15 usually isn't truly \"the same\" as the handmade, unique piece you'd get directly from an artist.  \n\nAnd partly it's because even artists who work professionally are, in many jobs, undervalued and underpaid. (See: the recent WGA strike in the U.S., which is partly about fair payment to artists who are integral to producing works that make a ton of money for the owners of the companies.  It's the old story -- the company owners want a product that people will pay money for, but they try to pay the artists who make that product as little as they can get away with.)   We are surrounded, in our day to day lives, by art -- things that were designed by professionals, pictures and paintings and furniture and clothing and on and on.  A lot of people take art for granted, and then aren't willing to pay for a work that's unique -- or not willing to pay what it's really worth.\n\nThankfully for individual artists, there ARE people to whom the value of a unique piece is worth a higher price than a mass-produced piece.  But anyone who does art and who tries to sell it is subjected to a LOT of this messaging that what we do takes skill, and time to learn and become good at, and the materials cost money, and the work is handmade and unique... oh, but you're asking \\*too much  money\\* for it.  Nevermind that quite often, when the materials cost is subtracted, the artist is actually making something insane like $3 an hour for their work.  (Tossing out a number for purposes of illustration, but generally you'd be shocked how little artists truly charge for the time a piece takes them, in comparison to wages for other kinds of work.)\n\nI'm sorry, this is a long digression!  Congrats to you if you've read this far. I went into this to say that your gf's sensitivity towards thinking you meant that what she was charging was too much for \\*her work\\* and you were surprised people were paying that... it's an idea that falls within this greater context. It wouldn't surprise me if she's gotten attitude from buyers sometimes, too; or from other people expressing shock at her prices and saying \"I'd never pay that much for that!\"  It does get tiring, after a while!  So even though you didn't mean that, it might help to explain why that's how she took it.\n\nGood luck smoothing things over!", "I don't even play D&D and regularly drool over some of the amazing dice I see online. Shiny math rock obsession is a real thing.", "The \"little bird\" was the originator of this portion of the thread.\n\n\"I can\u2019t understand people paying hundreds of dollars for Legos\"", "It's not about thinking she needs help selling.
