Then you usually double that or sometimes triple that to get your retail price. You need to include pricing for new designs, new experimentations, upgrades to your equipment, as well as a wage to yourself.\n\nThe market is also hurt by people who do not charge enough, they just charge enough to buy more of their supplies so that they can keep up with their hobby.
