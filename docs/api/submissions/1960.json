She owns a flat in the city center on a street blocked off for cars, you have to walk 500m from the nearest street with cars and parking is impossible in at least 2km radius. She also comes from a wealthy family. Her sister lives with her with her bf. I come from lower class family, but have worked my way up to middle class with hard work in scholarship. I think that could explain my gf's family's attitude towards me, because I haven't done anything to them or ever even been rude to them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm moving in with my gf and on the way my car, which was packed with basicly everything I own, broke down. Long story short I put my car with the nearest mechanic, was told it would take several days and stepped outside with everything I own in ikea bags. My family lives far and I don't have any friends in that area, so I called my gf and asked if she knew someone who could help because the alternative was paying for a really long taxi ride. She borrowed her mother's car and told me she was on her way. She drove to get me and back home, for which I'm incredibly greatful. She tried calling her sister to ask if they could help us get my stuff up, but she didn't answer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen we got there and still had no answer, we could either take the car to my gf's mother together and try squeezing my things in the taxi, she could have dropped me off and waited in a no parking spot for 20-30 minutes, dropped me off and circled around until I'd be back or let me out with everything I have, drive alone to her mother to give her the car back and get home with the subway. At least those were all the options we came up with at that time. We decided she'd drop me off with everything and drive to give the car back alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was a really slow and long walk, because I had a lot of stuff and it was heavy but I managed to get into the building. The moment I tried to get into the apartment though, I was blocked by my gf's sister and her bf shouting at me, asking what I'd done to my gf and where she was. Apparently they saw she'd called and tried calling her back but she wasn't answering (she was driving). They didn't let me get a word in, said they knew I was no good from day one, threatened me with the police and slammed the door in my face.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI spent a lot of really awkward time waiting outside of the door with my bags. My gf finally came home and when she heard what happened, she got into a shouting match with her sister, reminding her she lived there rent free. Her sister retorted saying she was trying to look out for her and that she should dump me, because no man should \"let\" his gf drive alone at night.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings are pretty tense right now.

It shouldn\u2019t even *be* a problem, except that her family\u2019s determined to make it one.

She is a grown-up, and made the decision herself to drive. It sounds like they just wanted to use this as an excuse to look down on you.", "As someone who hates driving with a passion (ADHD + terrified of traffic), mad props for your gf for not hesitating to come help you.

They need to chill the hell out, she\u2019s a grown woman and doesn\u2019t need them creating problems where there are none. On the bright side, seems like you and your girlfriend have a good and supportive relationship.", "Nta at all. Wtf she's an adult you don't need to \"let\" her drive alone. And how would they have reacted if she needed to go somewhere at night and you didn't let her leave. They would've been passed if you had tried to prevent her leaving. Nothing you can do or say will ever make them like you. They won't change their biases or classes for you. The best thing to do is to keep your space from her family and try not to let them affect you. Live with the knowledge that if that family ever lost their money they would be a disaster, if you lost your money you could build yourself back up like you did before.", "Very soft NAH. \n\nDepending on where in the world you live, your girlfriend probably *shouldn\u2019t* have been driving alone at night, and it seems like her sister and partner were genuinely concerned.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
