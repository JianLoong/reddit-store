I have two children F (4) and M (5) from a prev relationship. I have had pretty rough and traumatizing pregnancies with both, they were both healthy babies but my experience with labor and delivery wasn\u2019t pretty. My mom was with me both times and she did help when I needed it. My issue is that she suffers from bipolar depression and is very jittery when it comes to stressful situations. She adds to my stress and makes me more nervous then I already am. The last two times she exited the room every 5 minutes to smoke a cigarette because she felt she needed to calm down. This pissed me off even more and she came back smelling of smoke which made me sick. I told her to chill out that I\u2019m the one giving birth and she told me it\u2019s not easy seeing her daughter in pain. \n      \nMy last pregnancy with my daughter was the worst pain I have truly ever felt and she didn\u2019t help in the slightest. This time I have decided I do not want her in the room, she has already been with me twice and I think it\u2019s best for her to come after.\nMy gma agrees and says that it would be a better option for me to have as less stress as possible. My aunt F (22) (moms sister) offered to take her place and I told her that would be a good idea. She has never been in a delivery room before and we grew up like sisters and this is my last child. She is very calm and knows how to handle stress so I have no doubt she will be a good support along with my bf. She has also been there for me more than my mother for my kids and is truly my number one supporter (along with my gma). \n\nI told my mom so she isn\u2019t surprised when the day comes and she said \u201cfunny I\u2019m gonna be there it\u2019s my daughter why would anyone else go\u201d. She said I was crazy if she thought I was gonna rob her of this. I understand she feels betrayed but our relationship isn\u2019t the best anyway so she can\u2019t play the perfect mom card with me. My aunt is super excited and now my mom (her sister) isn\u2019t speaking with her bc she said she should have declined and supported her. My aunt isn\u2019t very confrontational esp with her sister so she said that she\u2019ll talk to me but I told her my mind is made up and to not feel upset I will even go as far to not allow her in the hospital at all. My brother M (19) thinks I\u2019m in the wrong and I am blowing this out of proportion. He has always been mom\u2019s favorite and it adds to my mom and I\u2019s strained relationship she wasn\u2019t very present in my life and my gma raised me most of the time due to her addictions and issues. We have fixed it but I haven\u2019t forgotten and I don\u2019t want this to seem like I am punishing her it\u2019s truly for my well being.

It would be one thing if she just said she was hurt and let it go but instead she tried to manipulate you and your aunt into getting her way. I worry that allowing her in now will result in her further disrespecting your boundaries, give her a sense of even more power over you, and ultimately make what already sounds difficult (giving birth) even more stressful and difficult.

It was just me and my husband there. My family found out afterwards. At least they have a legitimate reason to call me an AH. But your mother has been there twice. It's not her call to be there or not. It's yours.", "NTA", "NTA there seems to be an abundance of 'x wants to be in the birth room with me' and the answer is ALWAYS NTA \nJust like it is always YTA for pregnant people who are thoughtless and selfish and use pregnancy as an excuse. \nSo no need to post these daily. Asked and answered.", "NTA. Your body your choice and if she tries to force it at the hospital that is what your boyfriend and hospital security is for. Good luck.\n\nNo one is entitled to be in the delivery room but the mom and medical staff. The father as well but I know that can get dicey if they have split up. \n\nThe mother is going through a traumatic experience even in a flawless birth. No one has a right to be there with out Moms approval", "NTA.\n\nIt's your pregnancy and your delivery, and you get to decide who's by your side. The fact that your mom seems unwilling or unable to see beyond her own selfish desires and is stirring up other family makes it clear you made the right choice to exclude her.\n\nJust make sure you are clear with your doctor or midwife who is and isn't allowed there, and make sure your boyfriend backs you up! Sounds like your mom could cause a scene at the hospital so you may want to enlist a family member to manage her.", "NTA:  If she can\u2019t understand that the smell of cigarettes is unacceptable in the delivery room, that\u2019s on her!  You are in the driver\u2019s seat and you can definitely have her banned from the delivery room.", "NTA at all.\n\nYour family sound very entitled.  I nearly suspect other mental health conditions with your mother that may or may not be diagnosed and not just the bipolar.  Is she medicated because mood stabilisers often do a really good job when they work if they are taken regularly and you don't actually sound like you are just describing bipolar.  Bipolar is usually weeks or months of depressive mood followed by weeks/months of highs (mania or hypomania) where they can do anything ie start a business, fly, solve the worlds problems (only in their minds though).  If she's cycling very quickly and getting frustrated and angry, you're looking at something else.\n\nBut this is your body and your birth.  You are absolutely right in not having your mother in the birth suite.  It's going to make you stress.  Your labour hormones aren't going to flow as well and it will take longer and possibly be more painful and you are more likely to end up with an assisted birth or a caesarean.  You've probably heard the stories of when there are times of stress, that labour stops and then restarts when it's safe.  Often occurs in animals but humans are animals too.  Those stress hormones don't help and I wouldn't necessarily be wrong if I said your mother may have contributed to your less than optimal experiences last time if she was there.\n\nWho will have your kids when they go into labour?  Is it their dad?  Perhaps don't let anyone know when you are going in to labour or when you are going to be induced (if you end up induced).  Just call your aunt when you need her... or just have you and your partner.  Consider a doula if you want someone else to support you.  Don't have a running commentary of what is happening because it will turn around and bite you on the arse.\n\nYou could even say that you went to the hospital for an assessment and you ended up labouring really quickly and didn't have time to call anyone if push comes to shove.\n\nYour 19 year old brother can have an opinion when he manages to push a baby out of his penis.\n\nUltimately, your body, your choice, your birth, your choice of who is there.  Is it your partners first baby?  Does he have thoughts on your mother being there?", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re the person giving birth, you\u2019re the one who decides who\u2019s there and who isn\u2019t, because you\u2019re the one who needs to be as comfortable as possible.\n\nTell your brother when he is pregnant and giving birth he can invite who he wants", "You're NTA. Your pregnancy, your choice. You're not robbing your mother of anything. She does not have any right to be present when your child is born.", "NTA\n\nJust from the title. Regardless of reasons. But your mom telling you you\u2019re \u2018crazy\u2019 for robbing her of this experience? Tell the hospital staff she\u2019s not to be admitted under any circumstances. Provide a photo.", "NTA\n\nYou aren\u2019t robbing her of anything because it isn\u2019t her experience.", "NTA.\n\nTell your midwife who you have allowed in the room and who you have not. Explicitly tell them that your mother is to not be in the delivery room.", "NTA\n\nIt's your decision and if she makes it worse she shouldn't be there.\n\n> She said I was crazy if she thought I was gonna rob her of this.\n\nFuck that noise. Consider giving her picture to staff/security so they know who to look out for.", "NTA. I feel like I see a lot of posts like this, and the answer 99% of the time is the person birthing a baby has the final decision on who gets to be in the room", "NTA....the birthing experience belongs to parent(s) alone. They can choose to do it any way they wish. Perhaps be short & sweet telling mom....\"thanks, but I got this, dear mother.\" Then taker her to lunch.", "NTA\n\nYou need people that will support you. Period \n\nLeaving the room every 5 minutes, not ok. Returning smelling like smoke, not ok. Adding to the stress, not ok. 3 strikes and you're out!", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure when it became a thing that everyone else gets to dictate a pregnant woman\u2019s choices. You are the one giving birth and are the only person who gets to decide who is in the room with you. Inform your nurses right away who you want in the room in case she shows up.", "NTA at all! You get to decide who is in the labor and delivery room. You already told her your decision to not have her in the room, and she should respect that. It is understandable if she is hurt, but that doesn\u2019t change how you feel and your decision that she will not be in the room. You can definitely let the hospital staff know, tell the nurses when you get there and they will be sure she is not in the room. I suspect that she Is more upset that her sister is allowed in the room.", "NTA.\n\nChild birth is NOT a spectator sport.  You deserve to have people in the room who'll make you more relaxed and give you the strength you need.", "NTA. The only person who decides who's in the labor room is the one laboring.\n\nI'm surprised you let her in the second time, honestly.", "Why did you have her at the second one if the first one was so stressful? And if the first pregnancy was so traumatic, why the second one only a year later?", "I'm always surprised at people who were not involved in the baby creation and still expect to be in the delivery room.  Like, I don't really want to just air out my bits to my family, friends, etc.  \n\nAnd \"rob her\" of this?  The only one being robbed is OP of her sanity.", "Seriously! The audacity", "This is how my family is. No one knows till the baby is born. You are not an AH for this. And OP is NTA.", "Truly!  No woman I have ever known has even thought about the mother/daughter delivery room thing. Reddit is the first and only place I\u2019ve ever seen this issue. Why is it a thing?"]}
