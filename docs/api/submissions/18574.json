She's sitting there in a social setting while people are socializing in a way that prevents her from participating.  You're creating an extremely uncomfortable situation for her, even though you don't have to.  You speak English, so there should be no communication issue.  It's beyond rude. \n\n\"She can learn Hindi!\" \n\nCool, maybe in a few years she'll be fluent.  But you know now that she isn't.", "YTA, that is incredibly rude. You're excluding her from the conversation. 'She can just learn Hindi'...are you fucking serious? What's she supposed to do during the time it takes her to learn it? Just not understand what everyone else at the table is talking about?", "I really hope she broke up with your brother. What a jerk.", "YTA - of course its rude to purposefully exclude her from the convo, you were at dinner just the three of you. \n\nBut lol, \u201cjust learn Hinid\u201d", "YTA. \n\nYou have both lived in England your whole lives, so presumably you are fluent in English. Even if the girlfriend started to learn Hindi, it would likely be *years* until she was able to keep up in conversation with you and your brother. So instead of making a small effort to make her more comfortable, you and your brother and forcing her to take on a monumental effort. That\u2019s pretty much the definition of rude. \n\nIt sounds like this girl is very respectful of the culture and maybe someday she will learn Hindi. But she doesn\u2019t now. So speaking it in front of her is alienating her. \n\nYour brother is the bigger ah in this situation, though. *He* should have been the one to ask to switch to English for his girlfriend or he should have translated. You alienated a guest in your home. He alienated his partner.", "Yes, YTA. In general it is rude to choose a language that not everyone in the group speaks when a shared language is available. Sure it may be okay when the entire family is there to have a small 1:1 side conversation in Hindi, but the main conversation should not be in a language that excludes her. \n\nHonestly your brother is worse because he either should've been translating for her or asked your family to speak English while she's there. If it's a serious relationship GF should start learning Hindi, but a year is not even close to enough time to be fluent in a new language that may be very different from any other one she speaks.", "YTA. It is rude. You are knowingly and unnecessarily excluding her from the conversation.", "Yes, YTA. It is rude. \n\nLook, I am the white British girlfriend (now wife) of a Chinese chap. He\u2019s Canadian too but not the point. I never asked him to not speak Chinese around his family and worked my arse off to learn Cantonese. It\u2019s flipping difficult but now I\u2019m fairly conversational. \n\nHowever, my friends, when we were hanging out they\u2019d always speak English around me, and I never asked them to because they said it\u2019s polite to include everyone in the conversation. If people speak Cantonese to my hubs and he knows I don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re saying, he\u2019ll respond in English so I can be involved in the conversation. If I know a friend can\u2019t understand English and I have the capacity to translate, I speak in Cantonese. Because I feel it\u2019s polite. \n\nI mean, you do you but by speaking Hindi - which you have every right to do - you\u2019re purposely excluding her from the conversation even though you\u2019re British and speaking English wouldn\u2019t hurt you.", "Should we assume you'll only date people who speak Hindi so.........or do you plan to be this rude to your SO as well???", "YTA, you know she is the only person there that can't understand you, you are purposefully excluding her from the conversation, it is rude and would make her feel like she isn't welcome in your house or around your family.", "YTA. At a meeting with three people, it\u2019s rude to speak another language in front of the other person, when you could speak a language you all share.\n\nThat\u2019s different than when you\u2019re family is all together.", "YTA - It is rude to speak in one tongue when you can easily speak in another that a person with you can only speak.   It comes off as you are being purposely secretive, be courteous, sheesh.", "YTA. I'm not sure you and your brother understand how exclusionary you are behaving when you do this.  \n\nIt would be a good idea for you to try to put yourself in the girlfriend's shoes and imagine what it must be like for her to be in the room but not understand what is being said. Personally, when this has happened to me, I felt very left out and purposefully set aside as if I were a piece of furniture. It's not a nice feeling.", "YTA, as someone who speaks 4 languages fluently it\u2019s ridiculous you think it\u2019s ok to speak Hindi when you are in a very small group where not everyone does. It\u2019s basic manners, you all speak English and you should use a common language.", "YTA \n\nIt would have been okay if you had like ,older relatives who didn't speak English and spoke to them in Hindi while she was around because you had no other way of communicating with them. It would also be OK if you asked her if she minded you speaking Hindi to your brother, or if she'd like you to do that so she could learn. You didn't do any of these things.  Speaking a foreign language in the presence of someone who doesn't speak it is rude, plain and simple.", "YTA How is this even a question? You all master English perfectly and use it daily I assume. You knew she doesn\u2019t speak Hindi (as can\u2019t be expected after a year and while living in the UK). Why didn\u2019t you speak English? You knew she couldn\u2019t understand you no? That\u2019s incredibly rude. Don\u2019t you know anything about hospitality?", "YTA. It\u2019s just the three of you there, and so you are entirely excluding her from the conversation when you speak in Hindi. A few things here and there that she couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t be involved in, like \u201cplease pass the salt\u201d or chatting while the two of you wash up would be fine, but literally sitting at the table having a conversation between just two of you that she isn\u2019t welcome in? That would be incredibly rude even if you were all speaking English.", "YTA. What you're doing is just bad manners, you're purposefully excluding one person from the conversation. My good friend is married to a British guy who doesn't speak our language, I couldn't imagine hanging out with them and just speaking our language with my friend while he'd be sitting there lonely and confused while we chat away. Rude and exclusionary.", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s a dinner with just you, your brother, and his gf. All of you speak English, so you can\u2019t use the excuse that you had to cater to elders in the family who may only communicate in Hindi. Nice try there trying to turn the tables back on her by saying she could have just asked. Hopefully you will never be in a situation whereby people you love exclude you from a conversation and additionally you get blamed because \u201cyou could have just asked.\u201d    \n\nHow about you be more considerate and hospitable instead, since you are actually fluent in both languages?", "YTA, both you and your brother. It's basic manners to speak in a language everyone understands when it's such a small group and the other person is left with no one to engage with while you two speak in a language she doesn't understand.", "YTA - when you've got a group of people and everyone speaks language A and only some people speak language B, it's best to speak language A so that everyone can communicate with each other.  ESPECIALLY if it's only 3 of you.  \n\nConsider how rude it is that you and your brother spoke Hindi in front of his girlfriend, and there was nobody else around.  You deliberately chose not to speak the language that she speaks.  Why?  Why would you do that?\n\n>We translate for her though, and sometimes we mix languages too, we speak Hindi naturally amongst us so she could've just asked us to speak English\n\nThis was your response to someone else's comment.  Yes, she could've asked you to speak english, or you could have just been polite and spoken the language that she understands without her having to ask.  Grow up.", "YTA. If you're hanging out with your brother's girlfriend, you are purposefully leaving her out by speaking Hindi. \n\nI don't think it's fair to pull the \"my brother and I are close so we speak Hindi around each other\" when she is around. She is making an effort to get to know you and get to know your culture, but you are making it difficult for her.\n\nI have an inkling that there might be more at play here regarding your thoughts on his GF, but I'm not gonna say anything more.", "YTA\n\nYour behaviour was rude and exclusionary.\n\nShe could learn Hindi, you should learn some manners.", "YTA yeah it\u2019s your house you can speak whatever language you choose but when you have a guest over it\u2019s the kind thing to speak their language since it\u2019s clearly easy for you. Imagine if you were in her shoes and your bfs family only spoke Spanish around you - how would you feel? \n\nLearning a new language takes years!", "YTA. You two were rude, learn some manners.", ">However we still talk Hindi and practice many traditions.\n\nA huge part of Indian culture is being nice to your guests OP. Maybe focus on that aspect of the culture too.\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s a dinner with just you, your brother, and his gf.

The native UK language is English. You speak it fluently and easily. You invite an English GUEST into your home - and you decide to exclude her from the conversation, when it's wholly unnecessary to?! Absolutely you're RUDE. And I'd say exactly the same, regardless of the languages involved, in similar circumstances. \n\nYou should make at least minimal effort to make your guest comfortable and included, as a host - and you haven't done that even. What did you think as she was sitting there, unable to understand anything - that she was having a great time?!  It was intensely obvious to anyone with a modicum of social skills, that you were making it unenjoyable and exclusionary for her.\n\nAnd it's ridiculous to expect a guest to have to speak up, to get you to do the bare basics of hosting (like including them in conversation). That's not usually the guest's role, and it's a very awkward thing to expect a guest to do. She eventually snapped after a long time, but you put her in a terrible position. \n\nWhat next?! You and your brother invite her to a meal - and serve food to just yourselves, not her?! And if she asks why you haven't fed her - you say 'Oh sorry, you should have said you wanted a meal'. Some things like that should be damn obvious when hosting. Like if you invite someone over to SOCIALISE, they have to UNDERSTAND the conversation \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nYour solution she should just 'learn Hindi' is also unrealistic. Languages take years to learn to fluency, when you could simply speak a language you're already FLUENT in. And it DOESN'T change the fact she can't currently speak the language. You have no grace here towards her, suggest unrealistic solutions, seem hellbent on excluding her, etc. There's more going on here. I wonder if you resent her relationship with your twin. Surely you can't be THIS poor, as a hostess.", "YTA. My partner is Indian and I'm European. He always speaks in English to his brother and sister-in-law when they're around, and I always use English when we're both visiting my family. I have learnt some Hindi, but I'm nowhere near fluency, even after 4 years. \n\nIt's extremely rude to talk a language that others don't understand around them, especially when you can speak English. Why on Earth would you think that it's ok to do it? \n\nAlso, your comments...sheesh. OP, his girlfriend did nothing wrong. Stop with the condescension and apologize. The Earth won't stop moving if you start speaking English when she's there.", "YTA what your doing is unfair and rude, it's the same as whispering in front of people it's excluding her from the conversation, has she done something to make you not like her or what?", "YTA. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t speak my family\u2019s language, so when he comes to visit them, everyone makes an effort to speak English, and when my parents can\u2019t exactly explain in English, I or one of my siblings will immediately explain what was said.\n\nIt is absolutely rude to exclude someone in your own home by speaking in a language they cannot understand, let alone someone who deserves some respect as your brother\u2019s significant other. Your brother should have spoken up about it sooner and not left his girlfriend to have to speak up for herself in this situation.", "YTA\n\nBut - your brother is even more so.\n\nShe is his guest, and his partner. *He* should be the one responsible for ensuring that himself, you, and anyone else aren't excluding her by the choice of language.\n\nYou all speak English, there is straight up no reason to expect her to learn an entirely different one for your benefit.\n\nAnd no - calling out rudeness, when it absolutely is what it is, is not itself rude.\n\nThe onus was on your brother. He screwed up badly. You just suck.", "YTA. \n\nYou were born in, and grew up in, the UK, where everyone speaks English. Your brother's girlfriend is British and, lo and behold, she speaks English. She cannot be expected to learn a foreign language just for your convenience. It actually IS rude to have conversations in a language your brother's girlfriend does not understand in her presence, because you're effectively excluding her from the conversations. Sure, no one says you can't keep speaking Hindi with your family in your own home, but at least have the courtesy to speak English whenever your brother's girlfriend is around. Getting mad at her for bringing up this issue when you say it's the norm to speak English whenever you have guests is hypocritical.", "YTA. You speak English. When you go out as a group and everyone speaks English, but there is someone in the group who doesn't speak Hindi, it's rude to keep speaking Hindi.", "INFO: Were y'all speaking Hindi while it was just you and your bro and his GF?????", "My first husband\u2019s family did this. In three years I learned enough (without telling them I was learning) to know they were talking bad about me. That\u2019s why he\u2019s an ex! You may not be disrespecting her, but how would she know?", "YTA FOR SURE!! Exclusionary, rude, and just mean.  You actually sound a little entitled by your behavior.  You should be telling your brother to help teach her Hindi, or is she on her own?  Especially if she is a native English speaker, Hindi is even harder.  YTA and both you and your brother are just mean.", "YTA. As a PIO, I have seen this happen in a group of friends/colleagues, with a mix of speaking/non - speaking people, and I gently try to steer the conversation to English, because others are trying to listen into the conversation and want to participate and it appears rude and exclusionary. The fact that you have someone at your home is frankly just worse as it's insulting to a guest.", "It is rude. Yta", "YTA. So rude to speak in a language she doesn\u2019t understand. Are you purposely excluding her? \n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have had to ask. It\u2019s the polite thing to do when a person is around that doesn\u2019t speak your language. Why are you trying to alienate her? It will drive a wedge between you and your brother.", "YTA. It is extremely rude to talk in a language not everyone on the table understands. And that comes from someone who actually speaks a second language. I taught my kids better than your parents it seems.", "YTA\n\nHave some what a great host, so welcoming and inclusive. /s\n\nHospitality is nice, try it.", "YTA - if it is just the three of you then yes, you are intentionally excluding her from the conversation and that\u2019s rude.", "YTA. Considering that you and your brother both speak fluent English, it is incredibly rude to speak another language in front of her. It is telling her that she is invisible and not important in the least. It would not matter if the language were Hindi, French, German, or Klingon, it would still be rude. Rude, rude, rude!", "YTA, you\u2019re purposely outcasting her\ud83d\ude44 That would make her uncomfortable and it\u2019s very rude of you. Also, you can\u2019t just learn a new language.", "YTA and obviously trying to be.", "YTA.", "YTA, how would you feel if you were in her place?", "YTA\n\nHow would you feel being around people constantly communicating right in front of you, but they don't include you? Essentially, all she does when you 2 speak is sit there and wait for you to translate or speak in english. It's even worse since you have the ability to speak english. You're just so stuck on being 'right' that you can't get over yourself.", "YTA. I speak 3 languages and I do my best not to exclude a guest from a conversation unless it's clear the other person I'm talking to also doesn't speak English (i.e. my grandmother only speaks Spanish). Put yourself in her shoes - you're the girlfriend at your partner's house and they speak a completely different language to you, to the point you have no idea what's being said, the thread of the conversation, etc... Very alienating.", "YTA for keeping her out of the conversation.", "YTA when your hanging out just the 3 of you and 3 of you speak English and 2 speak hindi it is rude to just speak in the language not all of u understand meaning she is excluded and has no idea what is being said.

Why would you even plan dinner with the three of you and then speak in a language she can\u2019t understand. Especially when you clearly can speak English. That is absolutely rude. She shouldn\u2019t have had to ask you to speak English, decent people do their best to include the people sitting at the dinner table with them in the conversation.", "YTA - Very rude. Especially in front of an English person in England.", "Idk, she could have asked nicely, it doesn't seem like you were doing it to be rude, it's just a habit you have.\n\nEdit : the colon mentality is real strong in some comments. It wasn't done on purpose, the girlfriend could have nicely let it be known that she feels excluded. People are telling OP she is rude as if it was done on purpose. When you date people who speaks other languages, sometimes those situation happens. Being a little open minded wouldn't hurt some of you.", "ESH.\n\nThe three of you were having dinner together? It's incredibly rude to speak in a language that two of you speak and one of you doesn't in this context. So you suck, and your brother also sucks for following you into Hindi, and not immediately shifting the conversation to English so his gf can join in.", "I have to deal with english is my only languge everyday. And if you only learn one languge as an adult it makes it impossible to learn another espically a complacted one. It is one thing to speak hindi around her out of habit but still mostly speak english or trantlslate it. But try to put yourself in her shoes. Imagine if you couldn't speak english or had say a Japanese bf whose family never spoke a languge that you share around you.

You're within your rights to speak hindi with your brother, but she's right to understand that you're deliberately excluding her from any interaction during this meal.  I actually am more sympathetic to your position if you were at your parents' home, but you're at dinner with your brother, everyone can/does speak fluent English, and you're choosing to have a conversation with only one person at the table.  You have this right, but it's not very polite, and she has the right to leave, since she's eating by herself essentially.  She absolutely should learn Hindi, but that doesn't mean you can't be nice to her.  I'm kind of impressed that she put up with this for a year without saying something.  Had to be lonely.\n\nI sometimes have dinner with people who speak other languages that I can speak.  I try to make sure they feel included, since I know they don't feel as comfortable in English.  Sometimes this means I'm codeswitching, interpreting for others, or speaking one on one with someone in their own language.  It's a social situation that's meant to be fun for all, so I try to be a good friend/colleague/acquaintance/host.  You might want to consider kindness.", "NTA, if you're with someone whose family is from another country you cannot expect to hear only English, but maybe you could have made a bit more effort to include them in conversation.\n\nLmao at the whole \"twins = close\" thing. You two might be close but twins do not have to be best friends. Me and my twin were at each others throats growing up.", "Esh, it is your home speak whatever language you want, but understand that for someone who does not speak that language it's hard for them. \n\nNow I will say if you and your brother are just having a one on one conversation and she just happens to be around then I don't think it's rude. If she wants to understand the man she is dating she should learn his language as he already knows hers. Which I'm sure even though born in England I'm guessing English was a second language for you two.\n\nBut if they three of you are having a conversation and you and your brother switch back and forth between languages that's rude.

The fact that she had to tell you you were being rude because you don't know basic politeness at 23 is ridiculous. If you didn't want to be called rude then don't be rude. It's pretty simple. \n\nAnd you're even more the asshole because she's actively trying to learn your culture and you couldn't be bothered to make sure she was included in a social conversation. She's making an effort and you apparently couldn't do the same.", "YTA. You know she doesn't speak Hindi, so by doing so you are deliberately excluding her which is very rude.

You are rudely excluding her from socializing when you do that. You've done it multiple times and she finally called it out, you and your brother are both rude.", "YTA- just imagine yourself in the same situation- 2 people speaking a language you don\u2019t understand while you are sitting right there. It\u2019s rude.", "YTA! \n\nI\u2019m married to an Indian man, and I do not speak his language. I would feel so uncomfortable if he spoke with his sister and family in their language in front of me all the time. Especially if we where having dinner together, and they spoke in Malayalam the whole time.  \n\nYes, both your brother\u2019s girlfriend and I should try to learn the language, but it\u2019s still isn\u2019t polite to just ignore her like that.

She's a guest and you're supposed to be accommodating to guests but instead you deliberately left her out.\n\nEdit: after reading your replies to comments I can see a post from you pretty soon titled \"My girlfriend dumped me...\"", "YTA. Rule one of conversations. You speak a language everyone in the conversation can converse in. If she were able to speak Hindi it would be rude to ignore all she says and to not speak to her. By speaking Hindi you're doing worse because she can't even understand what you're saying. \n\nNow, offhand comments like 'oh, could you grab me X from the fridge' when someone is walking by the fridge, yes sure, use whatever language you want. But actual conversations should be done in the language all attendees speak.", "Yta. If you were with the whole family with multiple conversations going on, where she could have her own conversation with someone else, maybe it'd be OK, but a dinner for three is too intimate to exclude one member. You can speak English fluently, you're in England, theres no reason not to speak English. Sure, long term it would be advisable for gf to learn Hindi, but that's too early to expect right now.", "YTA\n\nYou are excluding her. It doesn't matter if you and your brother speak Hindi when you're together. When she is there, you should make the effort to make sure she is included. \n\nThat is ridiculously rude!! Even if she does learn Hindi, it won't be overnight, and what will you do then tell her to learn faster?", "YTA,\n\nI don't think their relationship is going to survive if her boyfriend and his family are so socially blind that they would willfully exclude guests to their home by speaking a 'foreign language'.  I say 'foreign language' because you live in a country that has an official language of english and you are speaking a language other than english around someone you know doesn't speak that language.  Furthermore, she knows that her boyfriend and his siblings all speak english because they were raised in England.  I don't understand how you can not see that this was incredibly rude.  Clearly she tolerated this behavior when at family events in their home but that isn't at all the same thing as when it was just you three.  That turned an uncomfortable situation into something that I would view as not only rude but exclusionary and hostile.", "YTA it looks like you're doubling down on your behavior because she called you out on being rude (which you were being). Take this as a learning opportunity because you sound really clueless about this. I'm Indian too and have lived in the US for 8 years now. I have lots of Hindi speaking friends, but if there's even one non-hindi speaking friend present, we switch to English because it's the polite thing to do.", "YTA, it was rude, practically everyone here is telling you it was rude and you keep defending it. If such a large majority of people perceive it as rude and you don't, that is somewhat telling. Excluding someone from your conversation who you know doesn't understand you is very rude because they have no idea whether or not you're talking about them, and you're socially isolating them. Now you know.", "YTA, you\u2019re giving Hindu a bad name. Just be respectful and include your twin\u2019s gf every time she visits. Don\u2019t you know English?

You are RUDE as fuck!", "YTA\n\nThe real issue is that it was the 3 of you, not a family falling into habit. She probably has more empathy for when you're all together because that's how you communicate at home.  But if the 3 of you are out doing something together, it feels like you're purposefully excluding her, even if that's not the intent. Perspective is everything.", "YTA. Everyone is telling you how rude you were. Why come on here and ask if you\u2019re just going to argue with everyone? Grow up.", "YTA and your brother as well. Get over yourselves.", "YTA", "YTA and to frame it a different way, imagine if you were dating a man originally from Spain. Every time he was with his family, he\u2019d only speak Spanish. (Or [insert language] you dont know) How would you feel never knowing what they were talking about? You\u2019d feel really left out. It\u2019s fine to speak Hindi when it\u2019s just you two or your family, but when others are around you need to switch to english.", "YTA. My in-laws did that, because I could just learn Icelandic if I wanted to be a part of everything. Of course I can, but in the mean time, while I am learning the language, it would be nice to be included. For fun: my in laws live in my home country, so I was not the foreigner in Iceland..they very much speak the same language as me. The same with you, you live in the country she is from and there is no reason that she shouldnt be able to speak Hindi, so while she might try to learn it, include her and speak English.", "Language insecurity is a thing and given that England is predominantly English where are OP and their family going to get a chance to USE and maintain their second language if they are forbidden from using it even at home. How often is the girlfriend present? If she is there for a substantial period of time then I think she is unreasonable to expect everyone to accommodate her at all times. If she is only present infrequently then I think asking to be accommodated is more reasonable.", "YTA. She\u2019s been sitting there twiddling her thumbs the whole time.

There is no need to be *translating*. Speak English. \n\nIt is just common sense to speak a language that everyone knows when in a small setting where there are people who speak different languages. You go for the common tongue amongst all so that no one gets left out. And then, to start the process of her learning Hindi, you throw in a few basic Hindi words, get her familiar with them. Let her hear them being used amongst words that she does understand, so she can put them into proper context. If she is still interested in learning Hindi, and in being in a relationship with your brother (which if she isn\u2019t, fair enough!), I suggest watching movies and other forms of entertainment. It\u2019s a great way to start because you can see both the English subtitles and hear the Hindi words at the same time. \n\nBut like\u2026 this should just be common sense. You don\u2019t wait for the person to ask. You just know not to leave someone on the outside of the group feeling like the idiot. Yeesh. YTA", "YTA. \n\nYou were being rude by excluding her. It is common practice to speak the shared language when in group settings, excluding small side comments that aren\u2019t relevant to the main conversation. \n\nYour responses to other commenters shows that you are being willfully ignorant to this and don\u2019t want to accept the fact that you were rude. \n\nYes, maybe in time she can learn Hindi but that can take a LONG time as not everyone is a parrot and can pick up languages super easily! \n\nHas anyone offered to help her learn? Taught her little things like \u201coh abc is xyz in English!\u201d? \n\nIs it really so difficult to speak English when she\u2019s around so she feels included and welcomed? Because I guarantee she\u2019s been feeling like an outsider the whole time if no one is making a real effort to include her. And by real effort, I mean not having to be constantly reminded to speak English when she\u2019s around. \n\nYou were being rude to her. Accept that and be better.", "YTA I understand your reasoning, but you are being rude", "YTA, she is right there, she doesn't understand you and you're excluding her from the conversation. Imagine you were somewhere with just her and someone else and she was talking to that other person in a language you don't understand when you know that they could talk in English and then you could also participate in the conversation.

YTA. She\u2019s asking you to speak in a language you already know.

It completely baffles me that people with absolutely zero insight or social awareness like this exist. Whenever me and my friends meet new people who do not speak our language of course we SWITCH to ENGLISH if that\u2019s what everyone understands.", "Honestly after your replies I think you\u2019d be happy that\u2019s all she called you. FYI, you were being rude", "You were rude.  I thought everyone knew that purposely excluding someone from conversations was rude, but I guess not.", "Speaking a language someone doesn\u2019t understand while they are a guest at someone\u2019s home is the height of rude", "Well - you and your brother were indeed being RUDE.  Acknowledge your poor behavior, apologize and do better.", "Common fucken sense. Your in a social setting where the common language is english. She shouldnt have to tell you holding a side convo in front of her is fucking AH behaviour. YTA", "What do you mean how are you supposed to know?? Did you think she enjoyed being left out of a conversation and sit there eating alone while you and your brother couldn't be bothered to include her? Do you need to be specifically told that people don't like to be excluded and ignored when they are invited over for dinner?", "You're being purposely obtuse. Excluding someone from conversation, especially in such a small group is rude. This is not rocket science. Would you be comfortable hanging out with two friends who spent the majority of the conversation speaking in a language you didn't understand?", "Self-awareness. Trying to imagine what it would be like if you were her.  That\u2019s how you\u2019re supposed to know.  YTA", "Are you seriously old enough to live alone and don't realize you're supposed to know that excluding a guest from conversation when you invited them over is rude?\nYou're jealous of your bother's girlfriend and YTA", "Because you\u2019re old enough to know how rude this is", "Takes about 3 to 6 months to actively break a habit. You should automatically be aware that speaking a language in a room where one person is excluded is rude, so you would think they would be actively trying to include them.......isn't that much effort.", "Bruh you can't be serious lol. I was born and raised in one country and moved to Germany when i was 18. I moved here with my boyfriend, now husband. We speak our mother language at home, with our family and basically always when we're alone. However, as soon as a German joins us, we switch to German. It has nothing to do with \"habits\", it's plain logic. Oh, and all my friends from our home country do that too.\n\n\nOp, YTA and you are rude. Your comments confirm that as well.", "A word isn't a complete conversation. The fact that you won't even acknowledge how rude this is, I mean seriously.", "People shouldn\u2019t have to demand to be paid attention to. Especially a person one of you is dating. Just forgetting her is the equivalent of telling her to get lost. I\u2019m also going to add I\u2019m not a native English speaker either and the habit you have of switching languages to speak only to each other is not only unbearably rude but will bite you in the ass one day.", "And she called you rude for that. She was correct. Instead of blowing up you could have said oh sorry... didn't realise I had switched to Hindi. But no, you don't want to include her in the conversation and you have this mentality that why i should be speaking a certain language for a certain person. YTA and you won't take this judgement but that's okay because somewhere down the line you'll realise why you were in wrong here.", "I speak four languages. It's perfectly doable to navigate between languages according to who you are in company of, and make sure one person isn't left out. If you're having dinner with just the three of you and you're yapping away in a language she can't understand, you are perfectly well aware that she's being left out. She doesn't know what you are talking about, she can't participate in the conversation, you can't claim that just goes unnoticed in a group of 3.  \n\n\nYou're making excuses for your bad manners and instead of accepting your judgment you are arguing it and seeking validation for your rude behavior. How about next time just show her some courtesy and basic manners.", "And that makes it better how? You are not only rude, but also oblivious about your surroundings. What a self centered AH.", "She never asked me to help her", "I\u2019m still confused. Wouldn\u2019t you speak English most of the time? How is this tiring? Aren\u2019t you bilingual?", "Because she's the one who want us to change how we behave at home", "She could've just remind us without calling us rude for doing something we're used to do", "How else would an asshole handle it?", "It's making a resurgence recently because...Well...the younger generations are fucked truth be told - poverty, unemployment, general societal strife always leads to easy populist - \"look after your own first\", \"what have them lot ever done for us?\" Type thinking. \n\nEverybody condemned the alt right/EDL types in England (RIGHTFULLY. I want it to be real fucking clear those groups should be condemned), but no one wanted the uneasy conversation about why those groups were OVERWHELMINGLY young men...there wasn't a sudden explosion of young white boys who just decided \"you know what Steve...absolutely fucking sick of all the foreigners here mate wanna go smash a mosque up?\"...this anger was built somewhere else and redirected, and you look at the absolute fucking shit show we're throwing our youngsters into and it's not right, but it's really easy to see how a racist could get them to blame entirely the wrong groups and choose entirely wrong solutions in search of an \"easy\" solution and a \"lowered\" burden - seeing the numbers of people reliant on food banks is tragic and almost \"hopeless\", if you look at it from a lens where you only give a shit about the white food bank users, or black, or Asian, its a lot less \"hopeless and dire\"", "Honestly.\nFirst thought, she is way better in bed than Hindi girls.\nOR brother is an ass as well, and she was all he could get.", "When your focus on that. When she is back with her family, she goes back to what is the norm to her. It is hard to break what is the norm to someone.", "Lol she's not trying to give up biting her nails. \n\nYou're talking about one of her first languages and people who speak multiple languages often mix them up accidentally.", "Great it was easy for you to do. It's not for OP. Sure she needs to work on it. That doesn't justify some of the comments here.", "I wonder if you do that at work as well", "How would it \"bite me in the ass\"? Care to explain?", "So no, you havent offered to help her.", "Why would she ask you? You clearly hate her", "Yeah I am bilingual, but what I'm trying to tell you is that it's tiring to not be able to speak Hindi all day as people won't understand, so I want to speak Hindi when I'm with my family", "You do change how you behave at home for guests? That's normal? If my brother and his girlfriend visited me I wouldn't be lounging about in my dressing gown, I wouldn't ignore both of them and go on my computer because \"that's how I behave at home\". \n\nYou make accommodations to your behavior when you have guests. If you can speak English and you're talking to someone in a group setting that involves someone who only speaks English you should be speaking English.", "Gali b\u016bti, kad \u010dia yra kult\u016brini\u0173 skirtum\u0173, bet man sunku suprasti, kod\u0117l j\u016bs to nesuprantate. Tai nemandagus ir i\u0161skirtinis elgesys. Laikotarpis.\n\nGalb\u016bt jums reikia paragauti savo vaist\u0173, kad suprastum\u0117te.", "But if you have a guest in your home that you know wouldn't speak hindi wouldn't you speak in her language since you know it ?", "She is your GUEST. Shouldn't you be trying to make her feel as welcome as possible when she is in your home? Stop making excuses, seriously.", "She called you rude because you were being rude.", "What you were doing was rude. She told you it was rude. There isn't anything more to discuss.", "Hey some people are raised to consider excluding people to be rude. \n\nSomething like speaking a language they don't speak might be called inconsiderate, which some people see as rudeness. \n\nIt might feel bad to be called rude or inconsiderate, but taking that negative emotion and doubling down is just going to cause more hurt feelings and negativity", "Never had a hindi girl or a bloke that drew me a comparison so couldn't say, but for me the emotional connection with a man directly correlates to how I perform- if you've been a total prick all day but I'm still kinda down for it I'm being the least enthusiastic pillow princess you ever fucked. Do your thing, preferably ASAP, if you're really fucking good you might get an audible moan, maybe 2...so if the lass in the post is like me he's probably not getting the best experience. \n\nI'm thinking it's a \"what he could get\" tbh. Rude sister probably ain't helping his dating prospects irrespective of him being shit too", "Yea, being rude........she knows this person doesn't speak it and actively keeps doing it. If she was saying that she speaks English but slips into Hindi when excitedly talking or certain words, that's fine, but she is knowingly leaving this person out of every conversation and this is a person that's important to her brother and she won't make any effort.\n\nGranted, she doesn't HAVE to,  but it is rude AF. In fairness, her brother is TA as well for not saying anything either.", "A bit hard but not that hard. Just requires a little bit of effort.", "One day someone you\u2019re not expecting to understand you will. Happens to everyone that does it. People also know why you switch languages, it\u2019s a common thing. But you\u2019re not going to listen to any of this, your responses show you\u2019re an incredibly rude person.", "I understand that you want to speak Hindi when alone with your family, but I really can\u2019t grasp why it\u2019s tiring (it\u2019s not even tiring for me and I\u2019m not bilingual) and why you would continue to speak Hindi around people who don\u2019t understand.", "It's unconscious again it's happen. You guys keep pushing the narrative that she is doing this on purpose. She needs to be aware of it, sure but this happens. They should both apologize to each other and move on.", "Well it's harder to them.", "I don't talk about people in front of them in any language", "It's not tiring for you because you don't speak another language you like more and that is your real language, for us we are \"forced\" to speak English outside of home, and we can speak our real language at home only", "So you see a person in your group that you KNOW doesn't speak a language and you don't automatically go, oh I should try speak in a language they understand.........is this not a automatic thought that enters you head???? You think no ill just keep actively leaving them out of any and all conversation.......Great way to make them feel included.", "Is it though? Or is it just a piss poor excuse for being rude?", "You said you did in your body of text :)", "I speak five languages and English isn\u2019t my first language. Speaking English all day still isn\u2019t tiring at all. I don\u2019t even live in my home country. It\u2019s still not tiring. Your just making excuses for being mean to your brother\u2019s GF who you admitted you don\u2019t like.", "Your \"real\" language? You're British born! English is your mother tongue.\n\nAnd you're \"forced\" to speak English outside your home? Last time I checked, English is the official language in this country.", "Again, I didn\u2019t learn English until I was 14. You grew up speaking it, I\u2019m guessing you went to school speaking it. Either you\u2019re not very bright or you\u2019re using this as an excuse. You\u2019re not forced to do anything. You live in an English speaking country, that\u2019s your choice. Your brother is definitely not forced to date an English speaking woman.", "As someone who speaks 2 native languages, one of which almost all the time at home with my family, I have absolutely no issue with switching to English when required, even when I have guests at home, who can't speak the language, and I am someone who really started speaking English daily at around 22. Your excuses are just bordering on pathetic, seeing as your were born in England, and English would have been the primary language through your entire upbringing. Just take the judgment and see if you can improve yourself.", "I wouldn\u2019t exactly say \u201cforced\u201d you were born in the UK therefore you are British whether you like it or not. English is the native language of the UK so schools therefore teach in English and outside your home the majority of people will speak English.", "Yta. That's what happens when you immigrate to another country. You learn the language. Your family immigrated to the United Kingdom. Where English is spoken by most people.", "I'm french congolese, my family speaks lari or lingala knowing I do not understand it. They don't do it on purpose they just do it and if I want I ask \"what are you talking about?\" That's how I was able to pick up words here in there. I also used to have Turkish friends in middle school who spoke turkish when they were together if I wanted to know what they were talking about or the meaning of a word, I would ask. Same for my friends who speak arabic. And if they were talking about me, well it's on them really I could careless.", "I know it's a hard habit to break because I've been in the girlfriend position pretty much all my life with my family and I have never snapped at them because I knew they didn't have a malicious intent, same for friends who speak another language. It's also a solution to nicely ask for translation or to switch language.", "Where?", "Hindi is my mother tongue because that's what my parents speak and that is the language of my culture."]}
