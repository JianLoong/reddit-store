We have a 12 week old daughter for whom we needed to find a babysitter for the time we would be out; 6:45pm - 11:30pm. As it turns out all of our usual babysitters are out of town tonight so I reached out to my older sister (35) to ask if we can leave our baby daughter by her house for that time. I said that she is generally a well behaved baby but there is no guarantee that shell be asleep by 10pm which is my sister's usual bedtime. Add to this that my sister and her husband have four sons ranging between the ages of 16yo - 4yo and she is currently pregnant with her fifth child and she is in her ninth month.\n\nBy way of background, throughout all of the years my sister had her children and I was not yet married I was always available to help her out with her kids. I picked them up from school and sitter more times than I can remember. I came over to tutor them in math and help them with their school work. I babysat them at nights and on three separate occasions. I actually moved into her house for a few days at a shot. I even moved into their house once with my 6 month old son (he's 2 now).\n\nAll the while we never complained and we were happy to do it because family is family. At the same time, my sister did not have many opportunities to reciprocate because my needs were always so much less than hers. I used her netflix account for years and I would often come visit her house when I needed a place to relax. I put my son to sleep by her twice over the last year and she picked my son up from daycare once. I am not trying to be tit for tat but I just want to paint a picture about how this relationship has worked. We are very close.\n\nSo back to my story, I ask her if I can leave my 12 week old daughter with her and she tells me in no uncertain terms (but very nicely) \"I need my sleep so if you want to leave her here until 10:00 you can.\" I passive aggressively responded to her \"most babies are born sleep trained and go to sleep at around 10:00 so you having a baby soon won't pose any problem for you.\" She got upset with me and told me I was making her feel bad that she needed sleep. I responded that given how much I had done for her over the years I was hurt that she couldn't give up an extra hour and half of her sleep to help me out even though she is in her ninth month.\n\nShe wants me to apologize but I think I did nothing wrong.

No babies aren't sleep trained and she'll have another one herself soon - but depending on how the labor goes the physical restraints will ease.

Why?!\" \nEver heard of doing nice things without expecting anything in return? Family is family after all... yeesh. \nYTA", "Do you honestly think he remembers his wife talking about that either?", "The more you have the more likely they come early too", "And \u2018all their usual babysitters are out of town\u2019 ? Either OP has burned bridges or did absolutely nothing to secure child care assuming his sister would come to the rescue", "I stopped reading when I realized they made plans at pretty much the same time their baby was being born. How exactly did he think that was going to work out....?", "And the baby is 12 weeks old, so they made this reservation right after the birth? Wacky.", "\ud83d\udcaf I had the exact thought \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. He cheated, has a kid with someone else, and lived w his sister\u2019s family bc his wife kicked him out. Annnnd now that she\u2019s taken him back he\u2019s fumbled the anniversary plans. I bet he wanted to do smtg big to make up for his myriad fuckups but waited til the last min to plan and is now making it his extremely pregnant sister\u2019s fault! \ud83d\ude44 YTA, obviously", "These kinds of details make me question whether or not this post is just fiction.", "And his kid isn't her kid.", "And since she has school age children,  she probably gets up at what? 6-6:30am to get ready for the day? Wanting to be in bed by 10pm is very reasonable.", "[removed]", "The nearly 500 downvotes are just us confirming that YTA.", "I'm confused, why would you think she would allow you to drop off your baby after your passive aggressive text? You doing favors for her over the years doesn't cancel out the fact that you mistreated her in this instance. Watching your baby is just going to show that you can get away with treating her like crap.", "She has 4 kids. She also knows. That's why she told you to get your kid at 10. Despite claiming you aren't trying to be \"tit for tat\" you seem to have no problem throwing in her face that you helped her to try and guilt her into watching your kid because of your poor planning. Despite your acknowledging you had way less commitment and responsibility at the time so you are actually asking way more of her than she asked of you. You definitely sound like the kind of person who does favors with strings attached and not someone who helped her because you actually cared about her.", "You\u2019re Beyond TA. A major YTA. You\u2019re sister deserves an apology", "Who was gonna be watching your 2 year old?", "No shit.", "There's a 4 year old. Plus 3 other kids. Plus she's pregnant. I am so tired just imagining what her normal day is like right now, I can't even imagine. The thought that somebody would get snarky and upset because she doesn't want to ALSO take care of a 12 week old baby is infuriating.", "Right and regardless if she works out of the home or is a SAHM (I\u2019m not making assumptions since it doesn\u2019t say) I just know she works hard with that many children. I\u2019m a SAHM of one and I can\u2019t even imagine taking care of four, kids and being heavily pregnant.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
