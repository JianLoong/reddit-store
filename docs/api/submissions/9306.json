We have a 12 week old daughter for whom we needed to find a babysitter for the time we would be out; 6:45pm - 11:30pm. As it turns out all of our usual babysitters are out of town tonight so I reached out to my older sister (35) to ask if we can leave our baby daughter by her house for that time. I said that she is generally a well behaved baby but there is no guarantee that shell be asleep by 10pm which is my sister's usual bedtime. Add to this that my sister and her husband have four sons ranging between the ages of 16yo - 4yo and she is currently pregnant with her fifth child and she is in her ninth month.\n\nBy way of background, throughout all of the years my sister had her children and I was not yet married I was always available to help her out with her kids. I picked them up from school and sitter more times than I can remember. I came over to tutor them in math and help them with their school work. I babysat them at nights and on three separate occasions. I actually moved into her house for a few days at a shot. I even moved into their house once with my 6 month old son (he's 2 now).\n\nAll the while we never complained and we were happy to do it because family is family. At the same time, my sister did not have many opportunities to reciprocate because my needs were always so much less than hers. I used her netflix account for years and I would often come visit her house when I needed a place to relax. I put my son to sleep by her twice over the last year and she picked my son up from daycare once. I am not trying to be tit for tat but I just want to paint a picture about how this relationship has worked. We are very close.\n\nSo back to my story, I ask her if I can leave my 12 week old daughter with her and she tells me in no uncertain terms (but very nicely) \"I need my sleep so if you want to leave her here until 10:00 you can.\" I passive aggressively responded to her \"most babies are born sleep trained and go to sleep at around 10:00 so you having a baby soon won't pose any problem for you.\" She got upset with me and told me I was making her feel bad that she needed sleep. I responded that given how much I had done for her over the years I was hurt that she couldn't give up an extra hour and half of her sleep to help me out even though she is in her ninth month.\n\nShe wants me to apologize but I think I did nothing wrong.

No babies aren't sleep trained and she'll have another one herself soon - but depending on how the labor goes the physical restraints will ease.
