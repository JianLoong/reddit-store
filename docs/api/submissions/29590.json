If you decide to go to court, there will probably be a parenting plan & I strongly suggest that you push for him to take a parenting class (at a minimum).", "Deadbeat dad demands the kid takes his surname. Isn't involved, and demands 'gifts' back.\n\nNTA. Like it's obvious you are NTA based on what you wrote. \n\nHowever there are two sides to a story, and the circumstances of the break up and aftermath, and things both of you may not have done right, would possibly change the verdict.", "NTA they were bought for the baby not him. They are still there for the benefit of the child that is still biologically his. He\u2019s just throwing his toys out of the pram (maybe that\u2019s why he wants your babies ones so badly \ud83d\ude02) because you didn\u2019t give the baby his name- which I absolutely agree with. When the baby is old enough the child can decide to have it changed, but right now it will make your life so much easier if you and baby share a last name especially if you ever plan to travel abroad.", "NTA. Save all texts related to him declining to keep his kid. You should definitely take him to court for child support, but don't be surprised when he comes back at you and tries to get partial custody because that meabs he has to pay less. That's why you need proof he's not seeing his kid now.", "NTA. No point in giving him the gifts for YOUR child. Take him to court to get support. Good luck.", "NTA.  Those gifts are for the baby, not for the grown man acting like a baby.  \n\nAlso, he is throwing this tantrum because you are not giving him control.  This is a common pattern for this type of man.  Do not be surprised when he knocks up another woman and dotes on that child as long as the woman does what he wants. And when he comes whining to you about how you need to lower or forgive his child support, ignore him. He chose to have more children, he can live with it.", "NTS but make sure to restrict communications to text messages and emails so you can collect all this beautiful evidence for the court. Document, document document - course have trouble with your word vs his word so collect solid evidence, like all those times you asked him to spend time with his child and he declined and complained about it... beautiful evidence.\n\n he's threatening you, seems like he is hiding something that he doesnt want you or the courts to know.... interesting. might be worth discretely looking into more.", "Child support is the child\u2019s right and if you aren\u2019t pursuing it, it\u2019s neglectful to your child.\n\nIgnoring that, NTA", "NTA  if he wants baby gifts, he can hold is own shower and invite his family. Agree with other posts saying to file for support.", "NTA.  I think you should very careful about having him watch the baby until you have a custody agreement in place.  If he decides to keep LO the police will not get involved if there is no court ordered custody agreement.\n\nAs for the gifts what kind of asshole would asks for gifts that a. He didn\u2018t even buy and b. Are for his own child?", "NTA - He doesn't deserve to have his name as a part of your daughter's name. It's not his stuff to take back.

Those were *gifts to your child* not to you! \n\nIdk what you\u2019re looking to take him back to court for, but if it\u2019s necessary for like child support or something, then do it. He\u2019s a deadbeat father and you\u2019re raising your child alone!", "NTA. Gifts have nothing to do with custody of child support. Absolutely get both of those things settled in court!", "NTA \n\nTake his ass to court. Let his family be mad.

I did the same 27 years ago and have never regretted it.  My child has told me he was so happy not share a last name with \u201cthat man\u201d.  That man has not spoken to my child in over a decade.  \n\nDo take him to court and establish child support.  Do not give him anything back. \nDo not let him come over to your house. Do not ask him to watch your child.  Do not ask him for anything.  Do not trust him.  Do not let him take your child for a visit.  If he wants visitation he can ask the court when they summon him for your child support case.  \n\nRemember you are not obligated to speak to him or see him. Your child comes first.", "A double-bar name would indicate the father is equally involved in the raising of the baby.

No problem there. \n\nThe gifts are for the baby. If he's not taking care of the baby, why does he need the gifts?

Nothing but headaches. \nNTA", "NTA. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT give this deadbeat anything back. A gift was given to you for the baby. Why are you even considering it? He hasn't contributed anything. He didn't spend a penny on any of these gifts for your child. Please take him to court so a judge can laugh at his stupidity.", "Don\u2019t have to give them back anyway. They can do one if they ask. Go to court.", "NTA those gifts were given to the BABY not you or him. He does not get to take gifts back from his child no matter who gave them to her.", "NTA.  But you need a formal custody/support order.", "He's being petty and immature. Definitely take him to court to get child support. It's for the child not the parent and has nothing to do with getting back at him.\n\nAlso, you are the parent so it makes sense that your child has your last name. He's just the deadbeat dad who barely sees his kid. NTA", "Giving the kid your last name is a whatever choice. If he\u2019s not in the kids life what does it matter if it has his name? I\u2019m leaning NTA. I would say build a relationship with some of his family. They may be inclined to help out and light a fire under his butt.", "NTA. Get that child support girl.", "NTA\n\nNo to returning any gifts for the baby. \n\nGet the paperwork filed for both custody and child support.  \n\nIf he pushes for any percentage of custody be sure you have the texts where he\u2019s shown no interest in seeing his daughter to date.  \n\nThe suggestion for a parenting class for him is a good one.  \n\nThe assumption because he refused counseling for his depression he\u2019s in control enough to care for his child is concerning.  It should be part of the custody discussion.   Ex what is he going to do if your baby starts screaming and he can\u2019t deal?  God forbid he shakes her. \n\nWhatever you get for custody including how holidays will work stick to it. Anytime he no shows for his day(s) send a text to him noting it. And document in your FU folder.", "NTA. \n\nLife is a lot easier if you have the same last name as your kid. My cousin travels a lot for work, and has to lug around a lot of legal documentation because she and her daughter have different last names. They've missed a lot of flights, and been detained at a lot of borders, because she has to keep on proving she's not kidnapping her own kid. If you're the primary care-giver, and usually have physical custody of your daughter, it's only smart to ensure you have the same last name.\n\nAs to the gifts - those were gifts for your child. If she's mostly at your house, that's where her things should be. Do not hand them over to your ex.", "You're NTA. Sounds like the kid is better of with you as the primary caregiver. And if those gifts were for the kid, who cares if they weren't bought by the guy. If they were bought to spoil your kid, that's what they should be used for!", "NTA. Children like this should not be fathers. Make sure you do everything you can to support your child. I also don\u2019t believe he\u2019s entitled to take back items that were not only gifts but not even purchased by him. I could be wrong though.", "It makes me sad someone is putting you in this situation. Just think, 7 months in and you are nailing the Mother role. Please stay strong and safe. :)", "Nta. I'd get a custody order agreed upon in court. Gifts for the child are non negotiable.", "NTA. They're for your baby. Don't let him take them.\n\nTake him to court, get full custody and child support", "Here's what you need to do quit threatening to take him to court and do it and mentioned everything especially taking the gifts back from his family and also he barely sees his child and gets an attitude about watching her save every text message like literally build a case against him and then go for child support nta", "I'm tempted to say that Y-T-A for not already having gone to court and made legal arrangements for the support that he owes the child that he helped bring into this world. I don't understand all the mothers on this sub who let men off the hook for their legal responsibilities to their own kids and enable them in being half-assed fathers by acting like the child isn't just as much their responsibility.\n\nBut ultimately, for the question asked here, NTA. At least you're trying to get him to be involved. Tell him if he wants the damn gifts back to start acting like a parent, get some counselling for his depression (honestly, if it's that severe he probably shouldn't be taking care of an infant alone anyway), and start spending actual meaningful time with his kid . . . then you can talk about his having some of her things at his place.", "Nta They were gifts.", "NTA\n\nGive back the items to his family members personally with an explanation why.
