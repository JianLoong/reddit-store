So they should stay with the baby and at the babys place of residence\nTake this guy to court honestly, i wouldnt want that guy watching my kid even if it was his.

This is just him being petty.", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA!  I have an ex like this. I find out I was pregnant and he was like So you think ur pregnant!  I had the blood work papers. But whatever. I left had my son and gave him my last night. He tried to take me to court to charge his name, 6 years after he was born. He had nothing to do with him in all that time. The judge laughed at him.

My daughter has my last name.", "Oh and he can't take back gifts. Shame on him. Share this post with him so he can see what people really think of him. I don't have to personally know him to see what kind of person he is. I had my father's last name and he still abandoned me. Some men just don't deserve to be fathers.", "NTA.

The gifts were for the baby. Just because he's acting like a baby doesn't mean he's entitled to her toys.\n\nEven if his family did ask for them back, you wouldn't be obligated to return them. Holding onto them would probably upset the people asking for stuff back, but I figure if they're asking you to return things they've gifted to your daughter, they're the ones burning a bridge.", "You don't have to give them back. Even if they ask for them, you don't have too.  Good for you giving your daughter your last name. She is a person and should only have the name of the person caring for her which is you. The sperm donor doesn't have rights if he isn't caring for her. He just want's bragging rights and nothing else.", "Please only correspond in writing.  Text or email.  No phone calls.  There is no record of what is said during phone calls. \n\nWritten documentation that shows how he is not involved in your baby's life will help you in court (to keep your baby with you, who seems to be the only one who will take good care of her...)", "isnt it normal that in unmarried families for the kids to get mommys name? is it even legal to hyphenate?

They bought the presents for your baby. They belong to your baby. Maybe keep in touch with those people and not him", "In my opinion OP pushed the father away by deciding to give the baby her name before it was even born. Now maybe BF wasn't around like he should have been but how did pushing him away further help? How did it make his family feel when they gave gifts and were willing to get involved? My thinking, which many may disagree with, is to change baby's last name to his father's, just like the other kids in school will have and probably like your child would prefer. \n\nThere is a chance with new name telling world and him that child is his baby that his behavior may get better and he will get and stay more interested. OP should not just call when she needs a babysitter. OP should tell him you want to set up regular visitation for him and baby so they can get to know each other and bond. Not necessarily frequent but regular. Start even once a month if that is what he is comfortable with and take things from there. Make him a part of child's life, an important one.\n\nThat is what will be best for baby, OP and him too. \n\nOP should try to get things on a positive road now, at the beginning and try to keep it that way. Good luck.", "NTA because the way things turned out you made the right decision since he\u2019s a deadbeat", "No, it shouldn't change the verdict. There's this concept under the law called a \"gift transfer.\" Once someone gives you a gift, it no longer belongs to the giver; it's your property. (Exceptions can exist for engagement rings, but that's irrelevant here.) So, those gifts are OP's under the law. And regardless of the gift transfer rule, the deadbeat dad would have no standing to get the gifts back--he didn't even buy them.  \n\nOP should keep the gifts guilt-free, and be thankful that she never married the jerk.", "An asshole kind of asshole takes candy from a baby, oops I mean gifts.", "Too right. Men feel entitled to it even though they do basically nothing for the privilege.", ">  I don't understand all the mothers on this sub who let men off the hook for their legal responsibilities to their own kids and enable them in being half-assed fathers by acting like the child isn't just as much their responsibility.\n\nShe's a single mom 2 months post-partum, you can probably cut her a little slack about not having custody and child support 100% figured out yet? In many jurisdictions (in the US at least) you can't even file until the baby is born.", "NO..Those gifts belong to the *baby* not anyone else!", "Cuz I believed the promises he made. I was stupidly in love", "Why would my brother have a kid with his psycho ex-wife? Love makes people do stupid things.", "Actually, from a logical standpoint, she's right. He's a deadbeat dad who never watches the kid and yet wants all the baby stuff that his parents gave as a gift back? In all honesty, unless his parents ask her personally or he starts carrying his weight, that stuff needs to stay where the child is most of the time, which is not currently with him.", "It's possible he was showing about as much interest in the kid as he does now and that's why there was no hyphenate.", "He\u2019s not.

Again, yes he should. \n\nBut you cannot put your child in danger. You need to contact an attorney and get court ordered child support, custody and supervised visitation until he can provide the court proof he is being treated for his mental illness.", "Don't be so sure. I would not allow him to watch the baby.", "No cause he's still living n.married", "Not to mention it just makes more sense? Like, a woman is more likely to know 100% a baby is hers. \n\nThe only reason giving the kid the father's surname became a thing was to deal with inheritance issues. Not many dudes in this day and age have serfs/estates/aristrocratic titles to leave their kids lol.", "Of course it's just an excuse. Of course he wants to be alone. If he's alone, he can forget all about his responsibilities. He can forget he has a daughter.  \n\nYou love your daughter and would do anything for her, right? One thing you can do, the FIRST thing, is to hold her father accountable.", "Or his lack of interest is because he feela no connection to the baby since the baby does not share his name.

You need to get the right therapist.  Talking about your feelings as a man is basically useless.  Working through your plans and getting your drive back and getting actionable solutions can be helpful, but most hack therapists don\u2019t understand this and just want to talk about feelings.  Depression is a real disease and talking doesn\u2019t do much.  Medication and lifestyle changes are the best solution.", "That\u2019s what everyone is saying but she needs to put the welfare of her baby first.", "On the topic of her question you should rule NTA because her not giving the kid his name is the question.\n\nYeah! She is ABSOLUTELY wrong for trying to get a mentally ill person who refuses to get treatment to take care of her child JFC!!", "Why doesn't he have the same last name, or hyphenated? That is the question. The lack of interest had to exist before the choice was made, because there is a lot of stuff he could have done to get his last name on the birth certificate. That's why I believe that it could possibly be the lack of interest ahead of time, because if he's still at least partially in the life of the OP, something had to happen to just have the name left off. I would like to know.", "You should look for a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) as opposed to other kinds of therapists.  Social workers tend to be more action-oriented and focused more on concrete solutions which it sounds like you might find more beneficial.", "That\u2019s what therapy is for. You have to come to terms with your feelings and resolve them before any solution is going to work.", "The point of my comment is that not getting help, regardless of the form it needs to take, is a person's choice. Refusing (to seek) help winds up being detrimental in some form or fashion; long have I personally fought against someone's mindset of \"I don't need counseling because I can get that from my friends for free\" or \"I tried this/that/the other meds but it didn't work for me so I quit.\" Not continuing to put effort into workable solutions when something doesn't go right is absolutely a choice one makes."]}
