In adulthood, civility turned into amicability which grew into a great relationship where we talk once a week and text all the time.\n\nOne of the things we bonded over the years was rolling our eyes / venting about our crazy but well-intentioned parents.\n\nDuring the pandemic, my mom started oddly and emotionally pressuring us to have kids. We ended up both telling my mom that it was no longer an option for her to bring up this topic to us. I also respected that boundary and did not ask Sis questions about it. Sis and I were on the same page.\n\nFast forward to this spring. Hubs and and my emotional / financial situation improved.  We call her and husband and tell them we are two months pregnant. The response was\u2026 lackluster. I tried to take it in stride, maybe kids aren\u2019t her thing after all. She and I chatted about other things since then, but the pregnancy never come up.\n\nA month later, I called her because I was planning on telling our folks, and at that point the floodgates may open. I asked her if she would prefer I start a separate group chat with the family about baby stuff so she doesn\u2019t have to get bombarded with baby discussion. I wanted to respect her boundaries. In that conversation, she said (unconvincingly) \u201csend me whatever, it\u2019s fine\u201d, and then dropped the bomb that **she and her husband have struggled with infertility in absolute secret for two years** and a few days before my pregnancy reveal, they found out that he may not be able to produce viable sperm. Damn! She was understanding that \u201cI couldn\u2019t have known and it wasn\u2019t my fault\u201d and I gave her my sympathies.\n\nI\u2019m now four months along, and she has not once asked me about my pregnancy. I have not brought it up. Additionally, she has become snippy, confrontational, and colder about other topics. \n\nAt some point, I\u2019m thinking of telling her that I respect her boundaries and have not discussed the pregnancy with her. But that it doesn\u2019t change the fact that not being able to share this happiness with my only sibling still hurts. WIBTA?\n\n(And because I know it will be asked - yes she has gotten a therapist and medication because of her situation.)", "created_utc": 1689097914, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14wyarj/wibta_if_i_tell_my_sister_her_pregnancy_jealousy/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She has enough grieving she has to do without feeling like she\u2019s not doing enough for you. \n\nWhy is it fair to want your mother to lay off the pressure but not for you to lay off the fertility celebration?", "YWBTA if you say anything to her. \n\nHer hurt over potentially never having a child is bigger than your hurt over not having her share your happiness. \n\nPlease don't make her feel worse than she already does.", "Info: \n\n>At some point, I\u2019m thinking of telling her that I respect her boundaries and have not discussed the pregnancy with her. But that it doesn\u2019t change the fact that not being able to share this happiness with my only sibling still hurts.\n\nWhat is your aim here? Do you want her to feel guilty about your pain for not being able to share? Or are you hoping that she'll tell you that you can share info, and that she'll just hide her pain from you and pretend to be happy?", "YWBTA because you know it is not against you, she is hurt.\n\nAnd anyway, the fact that your pregnancy is the center of the world for you is understandable but it is not for her and you can still share a lot of other things, do things together, without having to share this \"happiness\" (which is not one for her).\n\nLet her come to term with it, i'm sure she will be fond of the baby if you guys stay close.", "She doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s trying to make it all about her with her infertility problems so yeah ywbta, she can\u2019t force herself to be happy about it just for you", "YWBTA. she's not going to ask about your pregnancy. you're feeling happy and you're lucky enough to get what she may never have. don't rub it in her face and make her feel even worse about it. if you tell her you're upset with her for being too sad to be happy for you because you're happy, you're saying your feelings and situation are more important than hers.", "YWBTA", "YWBTA. It's completely understandable that you're feeling hurt about this, but it would be pretty shitty to bring that to her door considering the circumstances. If she's treating you badly, you can certainly address that with her, but you know exactly why you can't share this happiness with her right now and you need to respect that.", "YWBTA. You know why your sister is behaving this way and you can\u2019t fix it. So all there is to gain with this conversation is an attempt to shame/guilt her into feeling something she doesn\u2019t to make YOU happy. Plus you know her reactions after that convo aren\u2019t genuine and only bc you made her feel ridiculous and small for struggling with her own, very real problems. This isn\u2019t about you or your baby and it\u2019s a common response in this situation. Wait until your child is born and she gets to spend time with the baby - you may find excitement over a pregnancy and the bond between a child and close family member are very different. \n\nCongrats on your pregnancy!", "Don\u2019t do it. You\u2019re welcome to tell her you love her.  But let her process this. You\u2019re asking for a lot even if you don\u2019t realize it. \nJust be there for her. YWBTA", "I don't think you'd be TA, but I'm not sure what it would achieve. She's already seeing a therapist and on medication, so presumably she's trying to deal with her feelings.", "YWBTA - it\u2019s important to tell her how you\u2019re feeling. But it also might be a good idea to step back for a bit. It\u2019s unfortunate that she felt she couldn\u2019t share her struggles with you or share in the happiness of your news. \nI hope that your news hasn\u2019t started the pressure from your parents on your sister. That would be unbearable for her.", "ESH\n\n>She has become snippy, confrontational, and colder about other topics.\n\nYour sister shouldn't be taking her jealousy out on you with negative behavior like this. But IMO the \"right\" thing to do would be to end the conversation when she becomes nasty/negative, or to ask her to be nicer/more civil to you.\n\nBut Y W B T A if you try to act on this:\n\n>that not being able to share this happiness with my only sibling still hurts\n\nYou say you're respecting her boundaries, which is great! But it's an AH move to tell her that her boundaries are hurting you. It's one less person you have to talk about your pregnancy with. It's not the end of the world. Let her grieve. \n\nHow would you feel if your mother kept pressuring you to have kids even though you asked her to stop talking about it, and then your mom said \"I'm hurt that you won't let me discuss my excitement to be a grandparent one day!\"", "NTA - first, congratulations on your pregnancy.  \n\nYou're right that your sister is jealous, and she's having a hard time separating her feelings about her own issues from your news.  I sympathize with her, but she's the AH because of the way she's reacting to you.", "OK let me jump in without yes or no because it's not something that you can understand and that is NOT your fault. As a woman who couldn't have kids either, I can tell you the emotional pain that you suffer is horrible and you actually feel like less than a woman. It can start fights with hubby and wife. I brushed it off saying to myself that God said no for a good reason. This doesn't mean that once in awhile I don't break down crying or hurting, especially when I am around my sibblings and their kids. \n\n So yes but No lol. It would be like laughing at and rubbing into her face that you have kids and you are a real woman and she is NOT...YES 100% that's how she feels. I am sharing with you the emotional toll that this takes on a person so that you can respond better to her. She is hurting and not all jealous. PLEASE hear me out on this. :)", "YWBTA. Your pregnancy is an ever-changing event, and I get that it's exciting to you and *Frustrating* that you can't share it with your sister in the way you want to.  Life is full of disappointments and this is one of those for you, Suck it Up Buttercup. Your Wants do NOT trump her Needs. Her situation is *Devastating and Traumatic,* and you do not need to selfishly add your 'hurt feelings' to her burden. I would also point out that Therapy is a long process, not an instantaneous fix. You need to let go of any idea that you'll ever get to share this part of your life with her - you are on different paths now and she is the only one who gets to decide if she wants to share your path. Face Reality and let go of your fantasy.", "YWBTA. It\u2019s totally understandable how you\u2019re feeling, but talk it out with someone else, not her. You may need to seek out other support systems for your pregnancy. Maybe it\u2019s something you can talk about together later, but not now", "YWBTA - You can literally share your happiness with anyone and everyone else. Why is it so important that your sister jump for joy for you? She didn't scream and cry and tell you to never talk to her about the baby, so she's not making this whole thing about her. She's grieving and coming to terms with the fact that she may not ever be able to have a child that is both hers and her husband's. You can be sad and wish that you could share it with her, but to voice that to her would just add guilt to whatever else she is already feeling.\n\nWhat would really be the benefit of voicing this to her? Worst case (for you) she withdrawals even more from you because you don't understand where she is coming from. Best case (for you) she fakes that she is happy, but that will probably either end in her resenting you/baby or her mental health declining even worse, or both.", "Personally, I know my brother would love to have kids. If I found out he couldn\u2019t produce viable sperm, I *absolutely* would NOT tell him I\u2019m hurt I can\u2019t share enough of my happiness with him. I can be happy for myself. I\u2019d let his needs guide how much I share.", "What is her sister doing? Talking about pregnancy made her sad and she wants to avoid that conversation. What is wrong with it?"]}
