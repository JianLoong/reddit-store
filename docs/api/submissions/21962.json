In adulthood, civility turned into amicability which grew into a great relationship where we talk once a week and text all the time.\n\nOne of the things we bonded over the years was rolling our eyes / venting about our crazy but well-intentioned parents.\n\nDuring the pandemic, my mom started oddly and emotionally pressuring us to have kids. We ended up both telling my mom that it was no longer an option for her to bring up this topic to us. I also respected that boundary and did not ask Sis questions about it. Sis and I were on the same page.\n\nFast forward to this spring. Hubs and and my emotional / financial situation improved.  We call her and husband and tell them we are two months pregnant. The response was\u2026 lackluster. I tried to take it in stride, maybe kids aren\u2019t her thing after all. She and I chatted about other things since then, but the pregnancy never come up.\n\nA month later, I called her because I was planning on telling our folks, and at that point the floodgates may open. I asked her if she would prefer I start a separate group chat with the family about baby stuff so she doesn\u2019t have to get bombarded with baby discussion. I wanted to respect her boundaries. In that conversation, she said (unconvincingly) \u201csend me whatever, it\u2019s fine\u201d, and then dropped the bomb that **she and her husband have struggled with infertility in absolute secret for two years** and a few days before my pregnancy reveal, they found out that he may not be able to produce viable sperm. Damn! She was understanding that \u201cI couldn\u2019t have known and it wasn\u2019t my fault\u201d and I gave her my sympathies.\n\nI\u2019m now four months along, and she has not once asked me about my pregnancy. I have not brought it up. Additionally, she has become snippy, confrontational, and colder about other topics. \n\nAt some point, I\u2019m thinking of telling her that I respect her boundaries and have not discussed the pregnancy with her. But that it doesn\u2019t change the fact that not being able to share this happiness with my only sibling still hurts.

She has enough grieving she has to do without feeling like she\u2019s not doing enough for you. \n\nWhy is it fair to want your mother to lay off the pressure but not for you to lay off the fertility celebration?", "YWBTA if you say anything to her. \n\nHer hurt over potentially never having a child is bigger than your hurt over not having her share your happiness. \n\nPlease don't make her feel worse than she already does.", "Info: \n\n>At some point, I\u2019m thinking of telling her that I respect her boundaries and have not discussed the pregnancy with her. But that it doesn\u2019t change the fact that not being able to share this happiness with my only sibling still hurts.\n\nWhat is your aim here? Do you want her to feel guilty about your pain for not being able to share? Or are you hoping that she'll tell you that you can share info, and that she'll just hide her pain from you and pretend to be happy?", "YWBTA because you know it is not against you, she is hurt.\n\nAnd anyway, the fact that your pregnancy is the center of the world for you is understandable but it is not for her and you can still share a lot of other things, do things together, without having to share this \"happiness\" (which is not one for her).\n\nLet her come to term with it, i'm sure she will be fond of the baby if you guys stay close.", "She doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s trying to make it all about her with her infertility problems so yeah ywbta, she can\u2019t force herself to be happy about it just for you", "YWBTA. she's not going to ask about your pregnancy. you're feeling happy and you're lucky enough to get what she may never have. don't rub it in her face and make her feel even worse about it. if you tell her you're upset with her for being too sad to be happy for you because you're happy, you're saying your feelings and situation are more important than hers.", "YWBTA", "YWBTA. It's completely understandable that you're feeling hurt about this, but it would be pretty shitty to bring that to her door considering the circumstances. If she's treating you badly, you can certainly address that with her, but you know exactly why you can't share this happiness with her right now and you need to respect that.", "YWBTA. You know why your sister is behaving this way and you can\u2019t fix it. So all there is to gain with this conversation is an attempt to shame/guilt her into feeling something she doesn\u2019t to make YOU happy. Plus you know her reactions after that convo aren\u2019t genuine and only bc you made her feel ridiculous and small for struggling with her own, very real problems. This isn\u2019t about you or your baby and it\u2019s a common response in this situation. Wait until your child is born and she gets to spend time with the baby - you may find excitement over a pregnancy and the bond between a child and close family member are very different. \n\nCongrats on your pregnancy!", "Don\u2019t do it. You\u2019re welcome to tell her you love her.  But let her process this. You\u2019re asking for a lot even if you don\u2019t realize it. \nJust be there for her. YWBTA", "I don't think you'd be TA, but I'm not sure what it would achieve. She's already seeing a therapist and on medication, so presumably she's trying to deal with her feelings.", "YWBTA - it\u2019s important to tell her how you\u2019re feeling. But it also might be a good idea to step back for a bit. It\u2019s unfortunate that she felt she couldn\u2019t share her struggles with you or share in the happiness of your news. \nI hope that your news hasn\u2019t started the pressure from your parents on your sister. That would be unbearable for her.", "ESH\n\n>She has become snippy, confrontational, and colder about other topics.\n\nYour sister shouldn't be taking her jealousy out on you with negative behavior like this. But IMO the \"right\" thing to do would be to end the conversation when she becomes nasty/negative, or to ask her to be nicer/more civil to you.\n\nBut Y W B T A if you try to act on this:\n\n>that not being able to share this happiness with my only sibling still hurts\n\nYou say you're respecting her boundaries, which is great! But it's an AH move to tell her that her boundaries are hurting you. It's one less person you have to talk about your pregnancy with. It's not the end of the world. Let her grieve. \n\nHow would you feel if your mother kept pressuring you to have kids even though you asked her to stop talking about it, and then your mom said \"I'm hurt that you won't let me discuss my excitement to be a grandparent one day!\"", "NTA - first, congratulations on your pregnancy.  \n\nYou're right that your sister is jealous, and she's having a hard time separating her feelings about her own issues from your news.  I sympathize with her, but she's the AH because of the way she's reacting to you.", "OK let me jump in without yes or no because it's not something that you can understand and that is NOT your fault. As a woman who couldn't have kids either, I can tell you the emotional pain that you suffer is horrible and you actually feel like less than a woman. It can start fights with hubby and wife. I brushed it off saying to myself that God said no for a good reason. This doesn't mean that once in awhile I don't break down crying or hurting, especially when I am around my sibblings and their kids. \n\n So yes but No lol. It would be like laughing at and rubbing into her face that you have kids and you are a real woman and she is NOT...YES 100% that's how she feels. I am sharing with you the emotional toll that this takes on a person so that you can respond better to her. She is hurting and not all jealous. PLEASE hear me out on this. :)", "YWBTA. Your pregnancy is an ever-changing event, and I get that it's exciting to you and *Frustrating* that you can't share it with your sister in the way you want to.  Life is full of disappointments and this is one of those for you, Suck it Up Buttercup. Your Wants do NOT trump her Needs. Her situation is *Devastating and Traumatic,* and you do not need to selfishly add your 'hurt feelings' to her burden. I would also point out that Therapy is a long process, not an instantaneous fix. You need to let go of any idea that you'll ever get to share this part of your life with her - you are on different paths now and she is the only one who gets to decide if she wants to share your path. Face Reality and let go of your fantasy.", "YWBTA. It\u2019s totally understandable how you\u2019re feeling, but talk it out with someone else, not her. You may need to seek out other support systems for your pregnancy. Maybe it\u2019s something you can talk about together later, but not now", "YWBTA - You can literally share your happiness with anyone and everyone else. Why is it so important that your sister jump for joy for you? She didn't scream and cry and tell you to never talk to her about the baby, so she's not making this whole thing about her. She's grieving and coming to terms with the fact that she may not ever be able to have a child that is both hers and her husband's. You can be sad and wish that you could share it with her, but to voice that to her would just add guilt to whatever else she is already feeling.\n\nWhat would really be the benefit of voicing this to her? Worst case (for you) she withdrawals even more from you because you don't understand where she is coming from. Best case (for you) she fakes that she is happy, but that will probably either end in her resenting you/baby or her mental health declining even worse, or both.", "Personally, I know my brother would love to have kids. If I found out he couldn\u2019t produce viable sperm, I *absolutely* would NOT tell him I\u2019m hurt I can\u2019t share enough of my happiness with him. I can be happy for myself. I\u2019d let his needs guide how much I share.", "What is her sister doing? Talking about pregnancy made her sad and she wants to avoid that conversation. What is wrong with it?", "Question\u2026 have you once checked in on your sister and asked her how she is coping? Assured her that you will listen to her, support her. All this post seems to be about is how she won\u2019t be happy for you. It must hurt you\u2026 But have you been distraught for her? Have you sobbed so hard for her situation that your eyes refuse to cry anymore?\nIf the answer is no, then maybe you shouldn\u2019t be angry at her. \n\nI can guarantee her coldness, indifference and distance has absolutely nothing to do with you. Unfortunately you are reminder right now of the things she will most likely never experience.\n\nHer entire future has changed, the plans she and her husband have, she is absolutely devastated and she is grieving. She is grieving a future she won\u2019t have, an experience she won\u2019t ever get. This isn\u2019t something you wake up okay from.\n\nMay i suggest that you listen to Taylor Swifts - Bigger than the whole word song? It\u2019ll give you a little understanding of what your sister is going through.\n\nI understand that you\u2019re excited and that this baby is your whole world and congratulations. \nBut have a little compassion for your sister who will likely never feel the experience. She isn\u2019t purposely behaving like this, she most likely trying to rein in her emotions so she doesn\u2019t get upset and ruin your experience.\n\nYWBTA if you attempted to call out your grieving sister and it will do irreparable damage to your relationship.", "YWBTA\n\nI think calling it pregnancy jealousy is a bit cold tbh. Even if that is a little of what she's feeling, that's not JUST what she is feeling. She's feeling grief for children she may never have, possibly insecure about infertility, and probably overall just super sad having to come to terms with being a no kid couple.\n\nShe was extremely respectful to you, considering her own struggles. I think the least you could do is realize that you aren't entitled to 'sharing this happiness' with her. Simply for the fact that none of this will be happy for her in specific. It will probably make her feel worse. Give her some time, and when the baby is born, please don't push her to spend time with them. Sometimes life isn't what we want it to be, but it's what it has to be.", "YTA - You're not giving her what you want her to give you.  It's a two way street.", "YTA....\n\n\nYou literally agreed not to talk about babies and are now mad she won't celebrate you being pregnant?!", "Respect boundaries. You are not an AH, but you may become one. As for her moodiness, she is kinda an AH.", "This may be because I am happily child free and also an only child, but\u2026 NAH.  Your sister is hurting.  You are happy and want your sister to share in that joy.  The fact that these two are in direct conflict sucks, but it doesn\u2019t make either of you an asshole.\n\nI suggest finding a gentle way to approach your sis, something along the lines of \u201cI know this is hard for you, and I understand if you can\u2019t, but I love you and I would love for you to be a part of this journey with me, so is there any way you see that you could?\u201d", "YWBTA. Just let her be. I'm sure she's struggling.", "You\u2019re the main character in your life not hers .\n\nYWBTA", "YWBTA. I understand that you are sad that you don\u2019t get to share this with her. But bringing it up to her will likely only make her feel worse about the situation. I don\u2019t think she is trying to hurt you\u2014she is just protecting herself the best she can. It sounds like she is trying not to let her sadness bring you down.", "YWBTA. Telling her this would achieve nothing except adding to her burdens and drive a further wedge between you.\n\nShe is mourning and in pain and you're a walking reminder of everything she dreamed of, that she will have front row seats to for the rest of her life. When you have your baby it will be very difficult for her. All of your firsts will be all the things she'll never have. \n\nYou're allowed to feel sad that your pregnancy journey isn't what you'd thought it would be with your sister, but use that piece of sadness to imagine what she is going through and realise that voicing your hurt has absolutely no place in achieving anything positive.\n\nYou're just going to have to do what everyone else without a sister does during their pregnancy - find other people to talk to.\n\nNeither of you wanted this but it can't be changed. \n\nYou could say to her \"I understand that what you're going through is extremely difficult. I have been unsure how much of my pregnancy and baby is comfortable for you to hear. Could you let me know what that is?\" And then LISTEN and if she says \"nothing\" then it's *nothing*.", "Yes, Jesus, of course YWBTA.  For god's sake, have some empathy and don't make it all about you.   This is a real good way to divide you forever.  Shut your trap and let her adjust and meet you where she is.", "Yta if you bring up your hurt feelings. Quit taking it personally, it's not about you. She's going through something devastating. You haven't mentioned in your post the things you're doing to try support your sis as she grieves their infertility.", "Excellent question", "YTA, she has set a boundary and you need to respect that. If your goal is to lose any relationship with her go ahead and push it. She needs to protect her mental health, even if it hurts you. You cannot fathom what she\u2019s going through and just because she\u2019s sad for herself doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t love you or your child. Give her the space she needs, you might be pregnant but the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you and your need to talk about how happy you are that you have what she can\u2019t.", "YWBTA. She can't 'share this happiness' and you know it.  So what exactly do you want her to do, fake it and lie?", "YWBTA. She can't help how she feels and she's not being cruel to you. It sounds like she's doing the best she can, but not everything is about you and your pregnancy. She so far has been more understanding then you claim to be. It's not realistic to expect her to put her feelings completely aside because you want to be able to communicate with her in a specific way. Just because she's not as happy as you would like her to be doesn't me she loves you or your soon to be born child any less.", "YWBTA. Get over it and grow up.", "You know she\u2019s hurting, so let it go and go low to NC for right now. Don\u2019t talk to her on the phone or try to make her have a relationship during this time with you. Just enjoy your pregnancy and hopefully, she will come around.", "NTA- You didn't know how could you and she never shared with you.\n\nBut she had a chance to tell you if she was truly having difficult deal with your news.\n\nShe obviously is so obviously just giving her space while she had processes. She might be regretting not asking  to be in the background about the baby information.  And she might be ashamed to ask for it now.", "YWBTA", "And OP isn\u2019t having a hard time separating her feelings from her sister\u2019s news?? \n\nThe sister is *also* going through something major right now, and because OP\u2019s feelings are hurt, she can\u2019t or doesn\u2019t have to separate her feelings? Sounds like your applying the advice to one party but not the other."]}
