A few years ago, we\u2019d have thought of GaGa or Beyonc\u00e9.", "I gotta know who it is now and I don't even know who any of these people are haha", "I've been listening to the scrubs podcast with Donald Faison and Zach Braff. Donald has talked about how being stopped by fans for photos in general is not too bad if he's solo and not obviously rushing to be somewhere.\n\nBut at the pharmacy with a sick kid in tow when he is clearly a dad doing his thing is not cool and never will be to anyone. \n\nOP is NTA", "Years ago I worked at a now defunct membership store in the camera department, I helped a female customer with the cutest baby in her arms, I had a baby close to her baby's age and we just talked about our babies as she completed her purchase. After she left a coworker approached me and asked if I knew who the customer was that I helped, I told her no and she told me she is the wife of the actor that was in the popular TV  show 'Mash' at that time. To me even after coworker told me that it didn't phase me, she was just a friendly customer that I exchanged stories with about our babies.\n\nOp\"s friend is very unprofessional being upset about her daughter not being indulged meeting her favorite celebrity, she is an owner providing a venue service, not a meet and greet for her daughter. \n\nSo OP is Nta, her friend though is a big @sshole.", "As a Chef that has worked in some very high end restaurants, I've had the pleasure to feed quite a few celebrities. And most of them have been super chill, appreciative people who just want to have dinner, with a few notable exceptions. \n   My favorite is when one of my Mum's favorite singers came in for dinner and asked me to come out to compliment the chef. When I told her I had grown up on her music because of how much my Mum loved her, she signed a menu for her saying how talented I was and what a great kid she had raised. Believe me, that became a framed Christmas gift that year!", "I\u2019m really fascinated to who that was tbh. Sadly doesn\u2019t surprise me. I\u2019ve had the luck to meet many celebs and the ones who I had the time & such to be able to treat as regular people (rather than a brief meet & greet or photo op) were always clearly hugely appreciative.\n\nEven Arnold, who was *swamped*, my god was he swamped.", "I have an aunt thats a decently recognisable figure in New Zealand (where I live). Plenty of people her age know of her by name and everyone else absolutely knows of the projects she's worked on. I'm so used to her 'just' being my aunty that when we had to block cameras/press/local news stories about my granddad's passing I was shocked lol. Apparently plenty of people wanted to be all up in our business grieving bc she was involved.", "I was on the same flight as Vernon Davis (retired professional NFL player) a few months ago and we got talking at the gate while we waited to board. We had a lovely chat about pretty ordinary stuff, the wedding I\u2019d just been to, his kids, etc. and he was surprisingly enthusiastic throughout. Maybe he\u2019s just that nice of a guy but I kind of got the impression he was enjoying having a casual conversation that didn\u2019t revolve around football.", "This. I became friendly with a rock star in the UK - mostly because I didn't have the slightest clue who he was when we met. (Never listened to his band's music...still don't.) He trained at the same martial arts club we joined while we lived there and I found out he was famous about three months in. Celebrities are people, folks! And some of them are very nice and just want to be normal when \"off-duty\".", "Agreed and I think reconfiguring the daughters mentality to view celebrity itself as a job rather than a status might really help them understand the issue with their fanaticism and entitlement issues!", "you've got your names mixed up. elizabeth is alice and op's friend who got married, nancy and natalie are venue owner and daughter. but yeah, excellent poin", "I was at a restaurant in LA years ago when Dolly Parton walked by our table.  I\u2019m not good with faces but I knew I recognized her.  So I just smiled said Hi and turned back to my table.  The other 3 people told me who she was.  We all took peeks but none of us went to her table.  We all respected her as an individual on her own time.", "I once sold a tie to Bob Dylan, who could see that I recognized his birth name on his CC and went into his shtick. He talked about his favorite restaurant, later I realized he'd have invited me out had I clued in.", "Bothering famous people/allowing them to be bothered at your venue is a sure fire way to lose clients - people don\u2019t seem to understand how many celebrities want to escape sometimes and if you provide that escape you\u2019ll do way better in the long run. If OP had revealed Alice I\u2019m sure more than Nancy\u2019s daughter would\u2019ve shown up and Alice would have wanted nothing to do with that place going forward. Nancy should be glad it turned out the way it did.", "Right? I'm friends with the sister of an A-list celebrity (I've never met her). But whenever friend goes to visit her sister they always try to protect their time. They go to Disney and sister is all dressed down. She just wants to be normal and enjoy her family.", "Yep. I live in LA and have seen celebrities grocery shopping, eating dinner with their families, etc. I've had them come into my job. We don't bother them. They deserve to live their lives in peace like anyone else.", "Honestly similar situ here, I was up on the coast chilling in a park when I saw Chris Hemsworth with his wife and two kids. Celebs are still human and deserve that respect even if you want an autograph etc.", "My friend is or at least was like Nancy. I told her I'd seen a celebrity among the audience at a concert and she went \" I would've gone over to him and touched him\". I was like \"WTF you can't do that!\"", "I was less than 3 feet from Kevin Kline while shopping in an almost deserted mall. He was with his wife. He was also my favorite actor at the time. I thought about whether to meet him but decided he was shopping like a private person and me telling him anything wasn't going to be special to him, only to me, so I didn't bother him. They deserve privacy. NTA. \n\nNancy and Natalie don't have the right to know who will be attending. Alice didn't want to be bothered. They acted very entitled.", "> At worst, they\u2019d just go on in and fangirl.\n\nYep, that's what happened a month or so ago when Taylor Swift attended her friend and producer's wedding in New Jersey. The location was leaked on social media and so many people showed up the police had to come for crowd control because people were banging on the windows of the venue trying to get in.", "And a really great example too - because the author of that book is insanely private and appreciates people not bombarding him with attention. Much like Alice.", "Could have been the recent fan fiasco with Jack Antonoff\u2019s wedding, but I feel like the kid would have already heard about that before now.", "lol didnt expect to find an alice longyu gao/alice glass reference on this sub lol", "I was thinking Billy Eilish. Alice, Eilish, people tend to pick names close to real ones subconsciously.", "Yeah, Taylor's fans and paparazzi are insane. No matter how discreet her team may be, I think her fans could always find her", "I think in line with like, Sabrina Carpenter or someone else from Disney.", "My immediate thought was Jojo Siwa too.", "Influencers are way into that stuff too these days.  Half the channels I follow have merch links.  It really could be either.", "I think it's Sara Evans. I hadn't heard of her until OP wrote this post (and dropped a little too much info) though. If it's not her, it's a super weird coincidence.", "Yes, people should remember this. Some people say some celebs are rude, but it might be the case that they've been bothered whilst they're unwell or, like in this case, have a sick kid. They have lives and obligations, too.", "I remember being at a shopping center in San Francisco when Jerry Rice was on the food court getting (or at least trying to get) his fussy toddler a juice. It was shortly after a 49ers Super bowl win. I could tell he just wanted to get the juice and get out, but he kept getting stopped by fans. Who did not endear themselves to their idol that day!", "As a kid, I ended up in the same public bathroom as Mary Kate & Ashley Olsen (when they were kids). There were like six security guards in there. (Not sure how we ended up getting in lol). I remember thinking, whoa.... this feels normal to these kids. It was a bananas realization.", "I didn\u2019t initially name him because I didn\u2019t want to get swamped with \u201cbut how!?!?\u201d comments. It was Shaq. In my defense he was sitting down. It was during a time when he had a foot or leg injury so the zoo staff were driving him and his kids around in a golf cart.  But I truly am that oblivious. It\u2019s also somewhat genetic. My aunt was waiting tables in the 80\u2019s, at a roadside diner. Two very large men came in in the middle of the night. She joked around that they could be nfl players. They laughed. Because one of them was Joe Montana. The other was another player, though I\u2019ve long since forgotten who she said it was. Like me, she was utterly oblivious and had no clue.", "Lmao literally me with this Olympic ice skater who lives in my home town. Twice, even. \"I know him, but where from?! Just say hi to be polite but don't talk to him so he can't find out I forgot how we met.\"\n\nI once read this internet story from a guy who bumped into Kylie Minogue and had the same reaction. EXCEPT, he made small talk, sweating bullets, really proud of himself that he managed to avoid the topic of how they knew each other, hahaha", "I've done this! I thought I recognized someone as a return client when I was at work--actually I recognized her because it was Melissa McCarthy.\n\nI also watched a really awkward interaction between two customers once. Two guys were in the store and one asked the other \"Do I know you?\" In my head I'm like, \"You know him because he's Zach Braff from Scrubs, dude.\"", "I live in Wellington, New Zealand, home of Weta (studio behind Lord of the Rings etc), and work in the suburb where many of the offices and film studios are located. We\u2019ve had a bunch of actors in the cafe a work at and no one ever invades their privacy, it\u2019s really nice since it\u2019s obvious they just want to come in for lunch like everyone else does. \n\nIt was a different story when a bunch of All Blacks (NZ national rugby team) players came into the city centre restaurant I used to work at \ud83d\ude44 other customers would walk back past their table after coming down to the front to pay to walk out the back door! NZers and their rugby\u2026.\n\nAlthough when Hugo Weaving came into said restaurant I did look over at him an embarrassingly large amount, but only because I couldn\u2019t figure out how I knew him. A beard can really change a face\u2026", "Was it Dolly with her signature, character blonde hair? Or Dolly with her natural brown hair?", "I mean realistically Alice will probably have nothing to do with that place going forward, it's not like her business was on the line.", "That\u2019s just awful", "They aren\u2019t the same thing but they can be equally as effective. A band I follow once took a photo in front of a \u201crandom wall\u201d and now it\u2019s practically their fans mecca.", "Thats a really good one!", "Yup. My 7yr old was commenting the other day about how some YouTuber I've never heard of now has merch out and his friend at school has the guys shirt and now he wants one too. No effing way, kid. No. Effing. Way. \n\nOP - NTA. You don't owe an acquaintance ANYTHING. And you certainly don't owe acquaintances daughter a free fandom moment with her celebrity obsession, at the wedding of your friend. She should be grateful you gave her some business. I would cut ties completely with this woman.", "My favourite \"celebs are rude\" line was when Jennifer Lawrence said in an interview she hated fans approaching her.\n\nAnd was turned on for it.\n\nAfter her nudes were leaked. \n\nWhy was anyone surprised?", "But it's a venue she went to once at a wedding on an invite. She's not planning on returning for weekly cocktails.", "Okay but this woman probably doesn't want random teenagers sneaking onto her property to take pics/leave stuff at/graffiti a random wall", "Even David Pakman and Philip deFranco have merch!  Phil does monthly drops of new stuff, even!  Can't blame them a bit, selling shirts is fun. :D", "I can't imagine how distressing and violating that would have felt for her!", "For some people that doesn't matter, all that matters is that the celebrity was there at some point in time. Hell, there are Inns all over the place with \"X slept here\" signs. For me, I don't give a shit if someone slept someplace one time however many years ago, but for some people it's a big deal."]}
