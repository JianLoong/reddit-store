We hang out daily, we live together, you won't find a pair of siblings closer than us. My fiance knows that and in fact he's really good friends with my brother. Whenever my brother and I hang out, my fiance is usually there too. All three of us are pretty close.\n\nMy brother has been going through some difficult times. We have a difficult relationship with our parents that's a constant source of drama in our lives. And on top of that he's been going through a really rough breakup with his high school sweetheart. They had been together for over a decade and he really thought they always would be, so it's hard.\n\nUnderstandably, he's been feeling really low and really just unloved. I know that because he talks to me about it and my fiance knows that, too. I wanted to surprise him with a tattoo of his name just to show him I adore him, I'm his biggest supporter, and I'll always be there for him.\n\nI didn't let my fiance know. I didn't think I had to, but the main reason why I didn't let him know is he is the world's worst secret-keeper. Like, he'll tell what my Christmas gift is as soon as he buys it. Every year. \n\nSo I went and got it done and showed my brother and he loved it and now he wants to get my name tattooed on him so we match. My fiance was there when I showed my brother and he didn't say anything in front of my brother. When it was just the two of us, he started a huge fight that left us not on speaking terms. I'm not even sure whether I'm still engaged.\n\nHe says that if I was to get anyone's name tattooed on me, it should be his. And that I should've let him know so we could discuss it. Maybe that's normal for other couples, but we were never the type of couple that had to get permission from each other to do things that didn't affect us as a couple. What really bothered him though was I admitted that I would never get his name tattooed on me.

Your partner is dramatically overreacting and his request / demand stating that it should be his name is ridiculous. Even if you are together for life no one has the right to tell you that their name belongs in your skin.\n\nWhat you did for your brother was amazing and it\u2019s so great you have such a close relationship. No matter what happens in your lives however close or distant you will always be siblings and honoring each other with a tattoo is very endearing. \n\nThe controlling behavior and tone presented in your partner\u2019s reaction however is not ok. He would be the AH in this case. If you are not still engaged - however difficult that may be you may have dodged a bullet there. I do hope that he will cool off and come to his senses and realize he has over stepped and apologize to you and make up for this huge mistake. If not you may need to reevaluate this relationship. \n\nWishing your brother the best as he recovers from the loss of his long term relationship and wishing you the best as you navigate things with your partner.", "NTA, once i know a girl with..... four different names of her exes. ;)", "As an advid tattoo lover there are things you should get and things you should never get. A partners name is on the never ever ever list. I have a family member that has his soon to be ex wife's name tattooed very largely on his arm. He regrets it. Family is fine. Partners absolutely not. When you start a relationship you start it with the intention of not breaking up. I'm not saying it will happen but let's say you get Joe's name tattooed on you and yall do get married but in 10 years something happens and you guys break up. Now you have his name branded on you for eternity. It's just not a good idea. Your brother is someone who's been around your whole life and will still be there. Your fiance may not.\n\nNTA but he is for expecting you to be comfortable with getting his name tattooed on you.", "NTA his jealousy is a bit of a red flag tbh", "NTA. My wife and I only need \u201cpermission\u201d from one another to buy like a new car or something.", "I've gotten my children names on me but never a spouses or girlfriend.
