I would happily get my brother's name tattooed on myself (alas he is 20 so would 100% call me a loser if I did do it), and if my fiance wanted to have his sibling's name tattooed I'd be totally fine with it. Since my brother and I are of the same race/culture while my fiance is very much not, if I tattooed my brother's name strangers who have only seen me would definitely assume it was my boyfriend's name. But my partner would not give a shit about that, because caring that much about what strangers assume is deeply weird.\n\n You love your fiance and your siblings/parents in differing ways - a tattoo is not \"proof\" of you loving someone more. I have a tattoo of Jerry Mouse that I got as a joke when I was a teen: it does not imply I love a cartoon rat more than I love my partner. Tattoos aren't inherently a deep commitment of romantic love: hell I don't think I've ever actually seen an episode of Tom and Jerry, I just thought the rat looked funny.\n\nAlso, partner tattoos are just a bad idea. No matter how much you love each other, romantic relationships ALWAYS have the potential to end. However, if you love and get along so well with your brother as an adult and have such a strong bond, it's far less likely that you'll \"break up\" with him (unless he's a serial killer etc etc, but I would assume that is not exactly a possibility for the average person).\n\nAlso, there's no reason for you to ask or tell him about the tattoo.

I think you would have done better getting a matching tattoo with your brother that wasn't each other's names. \n\nAlso in most cases name tattoos are more intimate, husband's jealousy can stem from that as not many people get their siblings names tattooed on them unless it's a memorial thing.

Gosh that could never happen or be her fault!\"", "Spotted the person who hasn\u2019t researched how fucked up most serial killers\u2019 parents -but moms most specifically- were. Very few of those monsters were \u201cnature\u201d vs \u201cnurture.\u201d", "you are reaching for an arguement, your arms tired yet ?", "Lmao what in my comment said anything about not being empathetic?\nI have kids. They could all be serial killers. I'd still love them. I'd love them as I walked them to ol' sparky. Saying that a parent with unconditional love for their offspring, ESPECIALLY those who have outright admitted said offspring are evil and deserve to die for their crimes, is the reason said child turned out to be an evil killer? Where's the empathy there?", "Was it tiring building that weird ass straw man?", "Spotted another person with no kids or understanding of parental love.", "No, I enjoy this sub because it reminds me I'm a well grounded person.\n\nI'm not petty, not pathetic, know right from wrong, and reading the comments of angry horrible people, makes me feel ok and I'm on the right path.\n\nI won't defend Dahmer, or Bundy, or Saville, and say they still deserved to be loved.\n\nI'm all right. Thank God. When I start agreeing with the angry gremlins, that's when I need help", "I\u2019d say I\u2019m waiting on the edge of my chair for you to give me a few serials killers who were raised in healthy homes with loving parents but we both know you\u2019re incapable of doing so, whereas any major serial killer you name would align with my prior comment, no problems. So on that note, I\u2019m off to continue existing in reality while you chill in fantasyland.", "no one said they deserved to be loved lol", ">I'm a well grounded person.\n\nI've only read your 3 comments here and I can confidently say you are not. \ud83d\ude2c yikes", "\"I'm well grounded\" says the person arguing against comments that were never made. \n\"They're all angry goblins\" says the person with an elementary at best understanding of empathy. \n\"I'm not petty, not pathetic\" says the person being petty. \nLol"]}
