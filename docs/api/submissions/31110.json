I won\u2019t go as far as some and jump to the conclusion that they\u2019re racist, but a lot of folks are pretty insular and close-minded, especially when it comes to food. This is a pretty standard trope in British comedy, which is not a justification, more an explanation of how common it is. Their rudeness is entirely unacceptable though, but i expect they will have seen it as constructive criticism. \n\nYour boyfriend\u2019s role in all this is odd though. He presumably knew what you were cooking, at the very least at some point before serving it. And he knows what his parents are like, so I don\u2019t get why he wouldn\u2019t have prepared you for that reaction or indicated beforehand that his parents won\u2019t eat anything a bit foreign.", "NTA *at all* they're being incredibly prejudiced and your bf should not be defending that behavior.

So I understand being hesitant about eating things for the first time.\n\nBut I would absolutely try it, and if I decided it was too risky to eat, I would apologize for having the digestive system of a fussy baby, and explain my dietary restrictions. That is the polite way to handle the situation.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t appear you were given any warning about his parent\u2019s food preferences. You can\u2019t be expected to be psychic.\n\nFinally, \u201cthat\u2019s just how they are\u201d is no excuse for their behavior.

They are also likely the couple in their social circle that no one wants to invite over because they are generally unpleasant and unlikeable, but, due to community or \"social\" expectations, people put up with to not rock the boat or make enemies.  \n\n\nYou made a truly thoughtful, beautiful gesture of welcome towards them, as well as wanting to share one of your best dishes with your boyfriend's family because you care for him and want to show respect and care towards his family, and they did...that. And then he hand-waved it away and tried to put the blame on you for his own inability to be an adult and call his parents on their hateful and embarrassing behavior. His behavior is **not** and *will never be* okay. I would have a very serious discussion with him about this, because you are in no way at fault for any of their behavior, and it is **his** responsibility to handle his parents and any cultural differences they might be facing when they enter **your** (both yours and his) home and sit at **your** table. Though, in their case, it would fall on deaf ears, because **they are racists.** I don't think it would have even mattered if he'd forewarned you to make \"common\" food, because they would have found some other way to disparage you, your culture, and your country *in your own home* and been completely unapologetic about it because 1) they don't care; 2) they are racists; and 3) they knew--and know--exactly what they did, and will continue to do until they run you out of his life. Or him out of yours.  \n\n\nOthers have made very good comments about various issues with this, but no one else seemed to really address the huge red flag that was their waiting until their son had left the room to start attacking you. This is extremely concerning behavior, not just because it's rude, but because they are setting up situations that are meant to pit you and your boyfriend against each other. He won't ever be in the room when they do and say the actual BS, he'll only have your side and/or their side, and it will eventually come down to his parents putting him in a position to pick sides and choose who to believe. Which, again, is the point, because they want you out of his life. They don't like you and they don't like you with him and they will use this sort of behavior to paint you in the worst light possible. It will start with \"We didn't say it that way--it was just a joke. We're Brits; Brits use asshole humor all the time; she's not in Saudi anymore haha! She just misunderstood and is too sensitive.\" and then it will develop into \"She's lying. She hates us and has never tried to meet us halfway and now she's trying to turn you against us.\" and that will never end in your favor, especially with his general hand-waving and acceptance of their shitty behavior.  \n\n\nSo, you are going to have to decide, and probably very soon, just how much you are willing to deal with in regards to his family and his inability to deal with their bad behavior. If he is going to do better and actually support/defend you and see through their lies to their real racist behavior, then you may be able to go further in this relationship. He'll agree to deal with his family and, hopefully, you'll only have to see them once a year over a holiday or something. I still wouldn't allow or accept any of their behavior, nor would I invite them back to your home, but if you are willing to clench your teeth and deal because you and this man truly love and support each other, then it may be tolerable--with very honest, frank, and frequent conversations between the two of you. However, if he's going to show a complete lack of backbone in dealing with his parents and their truly horrible behavior towards you **in your own home** and within the bounds of your relationship, take this dinner as a sign of how much worse this situation is going to escalate and whether or not your happiness and the happiness and support of your relationship with each other is ever going to come before his parents and his own fear of dealing with them and creating firm boundaries in what he will and won't accept from them in regards to you and your relationship.  \n\n\nI'm truly sorry for and upset on your behalf, that you had to face this and be hurt and insulted on so many levels by *all three of them*. Please take care of yourself. I understand being far from home and not having a large support group, but don't be afraid to put yourself before your fear of being alone.

And I might be more cautious about their beloved son as well, though I do like that he defended you - at first.  \n\nThe way they waited to pounce on you until their son was out of ear shot is very telling. The level of disrespect, and the power-play - are really disgusting.  WTH is with reminding you that you aren't in Saudi anymore - as if you should leave everything about your culture or past behind, now that you are with THEM, in the UK, oh, how grand /s.  What a gross thing to say. Meanwhile, their son is basically mooching off of you?? Of course. Hypocrites. \n\nIt's a little rude, but would still be somewhat okay for them to prefer or even request the same cuisine/familiar foods they've always eaten - if they truly are not open to try new things. It's boring AF, and I'm not sure I would oblige such a request in my own kitchen, but they could ask - politely. But they did not ask politely, they acted like toddlers after being presented with a lovely dinner made special for them. They were disrespectful and extremely rude. \n\nSince they've made it clear they are not comfortable in your home, eating your food, if I were you I'd just agree to let them host and handle the menu from now on (you can offer to help, if you see fit). Problem solved, but do be prepared for lots of mushy peas and beans on toast, I guess. Sry, I don't really know UK cuisine well.", " Omg, I just clicked the link in your post and that looks AMAZING!!
