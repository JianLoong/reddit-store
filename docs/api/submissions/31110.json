I won\u2019t go as far as some and jump to the conclusion that they\u2019re racist, but a lot of folks are pretty insular and close-minded, especially when it comes to food. This is a pretty standard trope in British comedy, which is not a justification, more an explanation of how common it is. Their rudeness is entirely unacceptable though, but i expect they will have seen it as constructive criticism. \n\nYour boyfriend\u2019s role in all this is odd though. He presumably knew what you were cooking, at the very least at some point before serving it. And he knows what his parents are like, so I don\u2019t get why he wouldn\u2019t have prepared you for that reaction or indicated beforehand that his parents won\u2019t eat anything a bit foreign.", "NTA *at all* they're being incredibly prejudiced and your bf should not be defending that behavior.

So I understand being hesitant about eating things for the first time.\n\nBut I would absolutely try it, and if I decided it was too risky to eat, I would apologize for having the digestive system of a fussy baby, and explain my dietary restrictions. That is the polite way to handle the situation.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t appear you were given any warning about his parent\u2019s food preferences. You can\u2019t be expected to be psychic.\n\nFinally, \u201cthat\u2019s just how they are\u201d is no excuse for their behavior.

Never ate fish in any form apart from fish and chips, not had grains before, never tried chinese food etc. He's doing well and he's discovering new food and new flavours every day.\n\nBut the parents are oldschool and they can't just eat new things. So its a nightmare to cook for them, cause it needs to be from the list of the 10 ingredients they eat, and it must be overcooked/flavourless/boiled. We end up ordering a pizza for them often. They would openly refused any of my national food so I don't even bother offering.\n\nIt doesn't upset me anymore that they all share 2 tastebuds in the whole family: one for salt and one for vinegar. Food is amazing, and they are missing out. Don't let this get to you OP, you're not dating your bf parents, you don't need to please them.", "YTA Didn\u2019t happen", "NTA. english people are super fucking racist, especially to middle eastern people, and im genuinely so sorry you had to find out like this\n\nside note, the statement that your food had \u201ctoo many flavors\u201d is basically his mother admitting that her food is bland as all hell lmao", "NTA. You did something that was kind and generous, and they responded in a very rude manner.", "NTA, the dish looks super delicious and i'd have seconds LOL\n\nhis parents are just racist, never ever feel ashamed of your culture!!!", "NTA they are just bland and racist. Based on the link you added in, chicken & rice with sauce and potatoes is a pretty normal dish in the majority of the world. Granted you are trying to appease UK parents, a country that other countries routinely joke that they \u201cstole all the worlds spices yet can\u2019t use a single spice with their cooking.\u201d", "NTA. Your boyfriend's parents are racist, and he just told you, 'that's how they are'. You maybe want to rethink how much you want to be involved with a guy that won't defend you from that.", "I thought chicken and rice would be considered \u201cnormal\u201d food across most cultures too", ">super racist\n\nCould be.  Or could be they're xenophobes or garden variety rude people.  I'm married to a Brit and although we're the same race, his parents always criticized my American cooking the same way OP's bf's parents criticized his cooking.  Some British people think their food is the only \"proper\" food and don't hesitate to tell others.  It's rude, but unclear if this is based in racism.", "Haha no problem and yeah I think maybe it was the spices and seasoning I used? I'm honestly not sure, do British people just eat plain chicken and rice with zero spices? that would be concerning tbh", "Me too as I have all the ingredients! And seriously!  Chicken and rice is a staple in most countries and cultures.", "thanks sm", "I totally agree with you. OP id love to try the dish you cooked. You were thoughtful and made an effort with them. They threw it back in your face. They are totally in the wrong. Stupid fuckers.", "Yeah I think the boyfriend set OP up to fail here and is a bit of an AH too. He should have warned OP that his parents are racist jerks.\n\nOP is NTA and should never cook for them again.", "thank you!", "oh no it doesn't at all!", "thank you", "thank you sm\n\nI don't think the whole kids thing is much of a concern, biological kids at least, you know with the whole gay thing lmao", "thank you :)", "thank you and yeah I get that I'm just not really used to cooking for anyone who isn't saudi lol (except my bf but he loves saudi food)", "The recipe was for a variation on chicken and rice. I feel like it\u2019s reasonable to assume that is fairly unobjectionable, barring dietary restrictions.", " thank you :)\n\nloll np saudi food is the best (I might be a tiny bit biased though)", "thank you so much", "thank you and no problem! :)", "thank you :)\n\nThere's kabsa which is considered to be the national dish of saudi. Mutabbaq is really nice it's like a spicy folded omelette. Jalamah is a lamb stew type definitely 10/10\n\nsome really good desserts are:\n\nTumr bel nargine, coconut dates, I used to really like them until I started hating coconuts. Basbousa is a type of cake. Loukoumades are great too I think they're greek but they're very popular in saudi.\n\nmy mum used to make \u0634\u0643\u0634\u0648\u0643\u0629 (I don't remember what it's called in English) for my breakfast a lot I don't think it's from saudi but it's popular in the middle eastern and north Africa and also really good!\n\nI'm sorry if I went a little overboard with the food I don't get a lot of chances to talk about my country and it's food haha.
