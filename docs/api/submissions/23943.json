It\u2019s her own fault she failed", "NTA.  She was taking advantage of your feelings for her.  You were right not to let her use you like that.  She is TA.", "Possibly unpopular opinion, but ESH. \n\nYou are indeed an AH for being too petty to at least tell her that you wouldn\u2019t turn it in and give her a chance to find another option. I\u2019m a little curious why you had to be the one to turn it in, but I don\u2019t think the answer would change my opinion. \n\nBut also, she is an AH for ghosting you and then depending on you. In part, she brought this result on herself. \n\nAnd you are both AH to each other for not communicating and letting the \u201crelationship\u201d go on far longer than it should have.", "NTA. At that point, Im curious if y'all were still technically even dating", "NTA. Your girlfriend sounds like she was using you for your academic help and didn\u2019t care about your feelings. She ghosted you for weeks and only contacted you when she needed something from you. That\u2019s not a healthy relationship. You have every right to ignore her and focus on your own well-being. You\u2019re not responsible for her failure, she is. She should have studied and done her own work instead of relying on you.", "NTA but she sure is. You didn't cause her to fail her exams. She did. And, I'm sorry to say, she never was your girlfriend.", " NTA. Schools expect that the student do their own work. Maybe if she spent less time on her phone, she could have gotten it done and not failed her exams.  None of this has to do with you. She\u2019s a user.", "Info: was this assignment something you two had worked on together? Or was she asking you to send your completed assignment for her to repurpose for herself?", "Yeah man if you haven't heard from her for half of the relationship with no explanation, y'all aren'y dating anymore. She dumped you and didn't bother telling you about it, then tried to use your work to pass her class. NTA", "YTA\n\nVery immature approach. Also she isn't your girlfriend anymore. If a person treats you like shit, just distance yourself. You actually showed your personality in that, and it wasn't nice.", "NTA, FTB \ud83e\udee1", "NTA she basically dumped you and then tried to use you", "This opinion is so off base. \n\nThis \u201cgirlfriend\u201d hadn\u2019t communicated with this guy for four weeks. Radio silence. Then she contacts him unprompted to use him for his academic prowess to cover her failing ass. He had communicated his feelings to her in his poem, but it\u2019s pretty difficult to communicate with someone who doesn\u2019t respond to you. I don\u2019t find him petty at all. At that point he doesn\u2019t owe her anything.

My dear, check your academic integrity guidelines and then pat yourself in the back for not torpedoing your own studies.", "Academic prowess aside, I\u2019m interpreting that as the girlfriend asking OP to send her HIS completed assignment. Which would be cheating. So I don\u2019t see how he is petty.", "Seriously, The person who allows their work to be copied also gets in trouble."]}
