They\u2019re 10, 8 and 6, one is on an intervention at school. \n  \n  So we usually throw a Halloween party with lots of games/ silliness/ fun (think apple bobbing, chocolate eyeball hunts etc), but the last several times we\u2019ve been with them they\u2019ve been so outrageously awful that all fun was ruined and everything had to be stopped/ taken away (sometimes by us, sometimes by their parents). \n  \n  When we first started hosting family events they were less frequent, often had lots of other adults present and, frankly, their behaviour was OK- but it\u2019s escalated dramatically in the last 18 months. There\u2019s lots of sad context, which would give decent reasons as to why any child might be unsettled and disregulated, which I empathise with, but it\u2019s been 18 months now all-told and I\u2019m sick of being sworn at, physically hurt and mocked by small children who often face zero consequences. \n  \n  My question is, given how much I really don\u2019t want to do this, (1)WIBTA for cancelling the party?

Or some other kind of brilliant excuse to not put myself through it all again? \n   \n  (2)On one hand I feel guilty for bailing on children, but my partner is in agreement and although we both love them all, it\u2019s becoming so hard to be around them that she\u2019s dreading Halloween already and is also trying to think of a way to get out of it. Other aunties and uncles have also stopped coming to all events, so I strongly suspect they\u2019re feeing similarly- they\u2019ve all made slight comments at parties but it feels mean to ask what they think outright. \n  \n  So..

I know we both care about them deeply, but their behavior has been quite overwhelming and disruptive, and it's been impacting our enjoyment and the overall atmosphere of these gatherings.\r  \n\r  \nI want to have an open and honest conversation about how we're feeling and discuss potential solutions. First, I want to acknowledge that we both empathize with the challenges they might be facing, and it's not easy for any child to deal with unsettled emotions. However, the current situation has reached a point where it's affecting our own well-being and the enjoyment of these events for us and others.\r  \n\r  \nConsidering this, I'm wondering if it might be a good idea to reevaluate our approach to the Halloween party this year. Rather than canceling it outright, which could be disappointing for the kids, what if we explore the possibility of making it an adults-only gathering this time? We could frame it in a way that focuses on creating a more relaxed environment for everyone, where we can have meaningful conversations and enjoy each other's company without the added stress of managing the kids' behavior.\r  \n\r  \nAdditionally, it might be worth considering a different setting or activity that could help shift the dynamic and make the event more manageable. This could be a way of taking a break from the current pattern without directly attributing it to the nephews' behavior. We could emphasize that we want to try something new and different this year to make the Halloween celebration special in its own unique way.\r  \n\r  \nI know this is a sensitive topic, and I want to make sure that whatever decision we make takes everyone's feelings into consideration. It's important for us to prioritize our own well-being while also finding a way to maintain a positive and caring relationship with the nephews. Let's brainstorm some ideas together and see if we can come up with a plan that feels right for both of us.", "NAH for cancelling the party.\n\nI think the \u201csad context\u201d matters. What is being down to help the kids process what happened/is happening? Has your partner gently encouraged their parents to get them help? Even a conversation about how you both have noticed a major change in behavior and are worried could be beneficial.\n\nIf help is needed do you have the desire and are you both in a position to give it? Is there something you can/want to do that will help the boys?\n\nI obviously don\u2019t know how close your partner is to her sister, but it sounds like whoever is the sisters support team needs to start circling the wagons. \n\nIf your partner isn\u2019t part of that support group and isn\u2019t someone close enough to talk to them about their situation then simply informing them that you have different plans this Halloween is more than enough.
