It's understandable that you want to honor your father's wishes and the strong emotions he had regarding your stepfather. People process past events differently, and the pain and anger your father felt have clearly left a lasting impact. It's essential for your family to respect your choice and provide the support you need during this time. You're not being selfish; you're making a decision based on your feelings and your father's memory. Everyone deals with their pain in their own way, and your family should understand and respect your perspective.", "NTA If your father felt so strongly that he was using his dying words to express the hatred he still felt towards this man then it shows how much he hadn\u2019t gotten over this. You need to honour your fathers last wishes and tell them that your mother is welcome but at your fathers dying request he isn\u2019t allowed to attend, if this means that your mother doesn\u2019t attend then so be it.\n\nAlso can your mother really feel sorrow for the death of the man whose life she ruined and expect the man who ruined it to be allowed to attend like nothing happened?

It's mostly the person that cheated and your dad probably unloaded everything on the guy to avoid too much aversion for your mom.", "A funeral is so people can show their respect.

She also told me I was a narcissist, and I was stupid and ugly. To give some background, I have multiple degrees, gifted IQ, I do have dyslexia though. I modeled in my teens thru 30s, won pageants that were straight up beauty and pageants that are personality and education/volunteer based. I went to multiple therapists, and they all said she was a narcissist and I need to get away from her. I was so manipulated I thought my mother was right and they were wrong.

There is one, though, and it states he does not want him there. \n\nMy mother has strong traits of someone with NPD (she has not been formally diagnosed as a narcissist though) She is extremely manipulative and a strong gaslighter. \nMy father cried to me multiple times and apologized for being a narcissist. (She had gaslighted him into believing he is the narcissist) I encouraged him to go to a therapist that has a background with victims of narcissistic abuse however, he didn't. His mother also had strong narcissistic traits, which led him to believe my mother is loving. \n\nWhen she got caught cheating, she started a smear campaign against my dad. To even his siblings. She even told me he was an alcoholic and drug addict and he was not. I actually went as far to ask the hospital if he had been tested when he came in by ambulance, and there was only weed no alcohol in his system. Which is not the drugs she is saying. The example she uses to me to try to tell me he was one was him wrapping a car around a tree when he was 19, he had me in his early 30s. He actually didn't drink however he smoked a little weed every night before he went to sleep. \n\nThey only see the part of my mother she wants them to see. They see her as someone who is so nice she paid for my dad's arrangements. In reality my dad was explicit that he did not want to be cremated. Which she knew I clearly remember a conversation between the two of them and she laughed, saying she's going to have him cremated because he was so against it. She found out my dad was in bad condition and while I was on a flight to him, made arrangements to have him cremated using my name. (I'm the one who makes all decisions if he was in hospital and couldn't for himself and the one who makes decisions after he dies, he also had it explicitly written out he did not want to be cremated) \n\nMy stepfather they like him because he's nice. They think he's good to me, although they don't see what happens when they're not visiting. For instance one time, he tackled me broke my toe in a way that it has never stopped hurting because I was leaving my mom's house in my 20s, and she did not want me to. Or that his own daughter doesn't speak to him. \n\nHe, though, has beautiful beach houses that he lets everyone use for free or very low cost. Getting to use the beach houses for free are very big motivators for them.", "They did co-parent well, and they had a business until my mother actually decided to start trying to do work and ran it into the ground.

She only started showing interest in my dad when he took over my grandfathers company. I don't remember her around much before that, and she's not in any pictures from before he took over it.\n\nMy mom's newest lie to people who haven't met my dad was that he abandoned us and moved out of state. He moved out of state years after the divorce after they sold the company, and I was in college out of state with my own place in that state.

You had a previous post about that (and I\u2019m surprised before the funeral that he has already been cremated). \n\nIn the end, do what you\u2019re going to do. My only precaution is that you might be cut off from the family. If you don\u2019t care, then you don\u2019t care.

Sounds like your mum desperately needs therapy too if she\u2019s gotta lie and manipulate the people around her. I\u2019m sure that it was hard growing up with a hurt and angry dad and self involved mum. \n\nMaybe your dads death will be a catalyst for change in your mum, probably unlikely but crazier things have happened. \n\nYou seem like a great person but whether that\u2019s despite them or because of them only you know \u2764\ufe0f", "I\u2019m so sorry, hopefully karma will get her", "Thanks, I went to therapy to sort out what was going on. It's hard being raised by someone like her. \n\nShe won't go to therapy. \n\nMy dad actually made most of my childhood great. He was extremely happy, funny, caring, worked hard, and was a very involved dad. He would even chaperone school field trips, which was odd for the 80s and 90s to see a dad taking the time out of work to chaperone a field trip. \nHe was completely destroyed when she divorced him. My grandfather, who is her dad, is still alive (he's in his 90s), who said the other day in front of her that my dad died when my mother divorced him. I was so excited, which sounds weird, but I was happy and surprised that the only one she hasn't manipulated is her dad."]}
