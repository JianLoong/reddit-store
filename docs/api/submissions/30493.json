I didn't think it did until my dad's brother and sisters reactions when I said I was going to tell my stepfather privately and very nicely that it's nothing against him I just don't think it's respectful to my dad. \nThey flipped out, saying I was being selfish and its not right of me to ask my stepfather not to go and how will it make my mother feel if he's not by her side during her sorrow. I don't think I am being one, but I'm not sure now.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You could always ask and I hope he agrees to sit it out.", "NTA\n\nStick to your guns and make sure your Dad's wishes are adhered to", "NTA\n\nYour mother should not be allowed to attend either, even more so than the stepdad.", "NTA.. I'm truly sorry for your loss and the struggles you are facing. \nObviously your father had not put the past behind him and hadn't forgiven your stepfather. The funeral is meant to honor your dad, and it's kind of a slap in the face to have someone there that he blamed for ruining his life. \n\nIf you feel strongly about this, go with what you feel is best. Hopefully your stepdad, and mom, will understand that it's not about them, it's about your dad.", "Why does your cheating mother is willing to attend funeral to a man he cheated on and left for affair partner? Does she have not even ounce of decency?\n\nReally, they are abhorrent.", "INFO: I'm assuming your mother is attending and he is there to support her.\n\nIs there a specific reason your mother is attending as she's not been married to him for 30 years and presumably does not have any kind of relationship with him anymore?", "Nope. Funerals are about honoring the deceased. I think your should remind your family of that. Who would your stepfathers presence be for anyway?", "A funeral should be as the person who died would have wished it. Obviously your step dad shouldn\u2019t be coming. NTA", "I'm truly sorry for your loss and the difficult situation you're facing. You're certainly not the AH here. Grief is a complex and personal process, and your feelings are valid. It's understandable that you want to honor your father's wishes and the strong emotions he had regarding your stepfather. People process past events differently, and the pain and anger your father felt have clearly left a lasting impact. It's essential for your family to respect your choice and provide the support you need during this time. You're not being selfish; you're making a decision based on your feelings and your father's memory. Everyone deals with their pain in their own way, and your family should understand and respect your perspective.", "NTA If your father felt so strongly that he was using his dying words to express the hatred he still felt towards this man then it shows how much he hadn\u2019t gotten over this. You need to honour your fathers last wishes and tell them that your mother is welcome but at your fathers dying request he isn\u2019t allowed to attend, if this means that your mother doesn\u2019t attend then so be it.\n\nAlso can your mother really feel sorrow for the death of the man whose life she ruined and expect the man who ruined it to be allowed to attend like nothing happened? It\u2019s not about you being selfish, it\u2019s about you complying with what your father wanted for his funeral not what they want to make themselves feel better.", "NTA\n\nDo we not respect someone's last wishes anymore? \n\nYeah, I'm sure it's easier to just let everyone do whatever the hell they want with no conflict or assertiveness (regarding your dad's siblings, which clearly couldn't care less about his last wishes) but you should be entitled to enforce your dad's last wishes. \n\nHowever, I also agree that when someone cheats, the culprit is not the person they cheated with. It's mostly the person that cheated and your dad probably unloaded everything on the guy to avoid too much aversion for your mom.", "A funeral is so people can show their respect.  He didn't show his respect to your father when he was alive so why would he now.  Seems weird to me.  Message him and tell him that he is not welcome and if he turns up he will be escorted out.  I am so sorry for your loss", "NTA", "Nta", "No they aren\u2019t right.. your dad hates the guy and wouldn\u2019t want him there. Tell dads siblings to stay out of it.. he was your dad and you are following what dad would have wanted. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nIf your father was saying this on his death bed\u2026 I think you have every right to do it.  He hated him. He shouldn\u2019t be there.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you are dealing with this and I\u2019m so sorry you lost your father.", "NTA\n\nYour dad hated the guy. Tell the step dad that, and not to attend. \n\nHonestly, if step dad doesnt already know that he wasnt liked by dad, why would he even consider going in the first place (other than spite). And Im betting a lot of people there would be pretty upset if he did show up.", "NTA - please make sure he doesn\u2019t come. I know your mum might need some support but she can get that after the funeral. They\u2019ve also been divorced for 30 years so she should be there for you, but theory that\u2019s without knowing their relationship. \n\nI\u2019m a strong believer that funerals are about the living not to the dead but your dad would roll over in his grave and because of that you\u2019ll forever feel guilty if you don\u2019t refuse him entry.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I know that he had a dying wish, and your step dad will be going to comfort your mom which is normal. Being outside of the conflict can make it seem small. They might also have a different perspective since they were adults when the split happened. \n\nI understand wanting to respect his wishes. I understand wanting a significant other to comfort you at a funeral. \n\nBe careful on asking. There can be consequences to doing that, such as getting cut off by family.", "Might be, but I don't know, which is why I'm asking, as it will influence my judgement.", "Except if her attending requires her husband to also attend, that is not supporting her child because her child specifically does not want that in order to honor his father\u2019s wishes.
