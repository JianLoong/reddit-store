Your husband\u2019s first responsibility is to you.", "~~INFO:~~  How far by air is this other country? Are there nonstop flights?\n\n\"Another country\" could be England/France/Ireland or US/Mexico/Canada.  Big difference between that kind of travel and something like Greenland/Malaysia or whatever.\n\nNTA based on travel details below.", "NTA. If his presence was required, they should have made sure he was a available. Pretty sure \"birth of his own child\" tops \"uncle at ceremony\" on the scale of which requires his presence more in his culture. \n\nEvery baby is different, every pregnancy is different. It's not a matter of it you'll be fine or not. HE IS OKAY MISSING THE BIRTH OF HIS FIRST CHILD. This is not okay with you and you need to to straight up tell him. There is no do over. This ceremony could have taken place at any time. Your baby will show up on their own schedule. \n\nFWIW until I went into labor, my husband was determined that our child would show up exactly on schedule on the due date. He did not get that it's a guess. Our child was 3 weeks early. I was 6 weeks early. I have a friend with 4 natural  kids and a few surrogacies, all her natural kids have been born past 40 weeks. Even with her surrogacy pregnancies, where they know the date you actually got pregnant in an office, none showed up on the due date. One was after and one was early and she had complications. \n\nOf the many mothers I know, a handful have had babies show up on due date. Those are the rarity.", "INFO: what is the significance of this \"cultural event\"?", "NTA. Two to three weeks is cutting it too close. Your in-laws are AHs for expecting your husband to come but your husband is an even bigger AH because it\u2019s about his wife and child.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that your husband dismiss your concern is a bit troubling, tbh. You are pregnant. His main role is to make sure your needs are met.", "NTA \n\nBabies are so rarely perfectly on time. No non-essential travel should be happening so close to the due date. International travel means it would take him a long time to get back if he suddenly needed to and there is a decent risk of him picking up a certain nasty virus.", "NTA. Early births are quite common with the first child. He should not put you through that kind of stress, it is not fair. Either they move the trip or he stays with you.", "NTA - your husband is thinking like a doctor and not a husband and parent-to-be.  \n\nAs a doctor, he assumes that an early birth isn\u2019t likely and if it is, there are doctors that can handle it.   \n\nHe is not thinking like a husband, that of he is gone and something happens, you will have to go through the medical event/birth alone without your husband.  What happens if you have a medical event and can\u2019t communicate??? He won\u2019t be there to make the decisions, your mother will be making your healthcare decisions.  \n\nHe isn\u2019t thinking like a parent-to-be, that there is a real possibility that he will miss the birth of his child.  What happens if there is a medical issue with his child, he won\u2019t be there to participate in the decisions.\n\nAs a doctor, some other doctor can fill in as the doctor.  There is no replacement for his role as husband, or as father to be.\n\nHe has priorities. When he married you, you/marriage became his first priority, and his role as son/brother/uncle came last.  When you became pregnant, his role as father-to-be comes first, then you/marriage, then son,brother, uncle.  He needs to be putting his husband/parent hats and out your needs first.  Right now, he is using his doctor\u2019s hat to justify his trip.\n\nYour SIL and BIL put SIL and the baby\u2019s needs first by not going to your wedding.  Even at the end of the pandemic, there were a high number of pregnant women getting Covid and having catastrophic medical issues.  If I had been in their shoes, I would have stayed home and not risked it.\n\nYou and your husband need to discuss his roles and priorities.  And while he hopes you don\u2019t deliver early, he can\u2019t promise that, and how,is he going to feel if he misses your child\u2019s birth or if he is not there to help you and take care of you if you have a medical emergency??  My SIL had a completely normal pregnancy until 6 weeks before due date and then went into early labor, they couldn\u2019t stop it, water broke, and she delivered\u2026. It all happened within 8 -10 hours\u2026. How is he going to feel??  What is he going to say?? Oops??  You can say to him, that if he isn\u2019t there, he will be proving to you that you don\u2019t need him, that you can\u2019t trust him to be there when you need him, and that makes you question how committed he is to his marriage to you.  When he married you he made vows to you to put you first, forsaking all others.  That vow isn\u2019t about cheating, it\u2019s about not letting anyone else interfere in the marriage, like inconsiderate relatives scheduling an event while you are very pregnant so that he could be guilted into leaving you.  That is interfering in your marital relationship.", "NTA. Just like they had concerns while she was pregnant and you honored them they should as well. Especially with being even further along. Doesn\u2019t seem fair to be there for his niece but not for the birth of his child in case baby comes a little earlier. Have him zoom. Maybe it could have been suggested previously to push it but now it would just cause more drama.", "NTA but stop focusing on them because you don\u2019t need their approval to not attend or for your husband to not attend. You need your husband to agree with you. If this is a serious issue for you, sit down and say so \u201cif you leave me to travel internationally when I am 8 months pregnant and are willing to risk missing the birth of our child, it will affect how I feel about you and the future of our marriage.\u201d", "This is a husband problem- not an in-laws planned the wedding at a bad time for me problem.  You and his baby should take top priority.", "NTA - My 1st came 4 weeks early my 2nd 10 days early, simplest way to get your point across to your husband will be to tell him, you are okay with him going, if he is okay with potentially missing the birth of his 1st child.  It is very inconsiderate of his family to plan this when they know your due date.", "NAH. It seems a bit of a stretch to expect them to move the whole ceremony to a different just because one person might give birth then. I definitely understand your apprehension about your husband being out of the country so close to your due date. it sucks for your husband, as he probably feels pressure on both sides of the family, pressure to come to his very important ceremony and pressure to stay close to home with you. Is there any way he can stay home, but attend the ceremony virtually?", "You had your wedding during Covid and feel shady that people didn't attend? And now you want a whole family to reschedule a celebration around you? I mean?!? Yta", "NTA\n\nHis own incoming baby and you should be more important than whatever ceremony niece needs to go through. For you to want or even demand him to remain home to be ready seeing that you\u2019re 8 months pregnant is logical and make sense", "NTA\nCan you have a conference call with your husband and your doctor so your husband can hear it from someone else what can happen when you're 8 months pregnant?\nThis question has come up on the sub before. Maybe search for it and find out how other pregnant women dealt with the situation.", "NTA for wanting your husband to stay with you and not go to the trip at all. I understand this is a first and giving birth is not easy AT ALL. The least he can do is be there with you.\n\nBut soft YTA for wanting the whole trip to be moved for you. Their lives dont revolve around you. That might be the hormones typing.\n\nIdk I feel like this is a couple thing. Deal with husband about this. He needs to be in the trip but he needs to be there with you more. His priorities are kinda the problem here not your BIL and SIL's trip.", "NTA \n\nHe needs to be home, you\u2019re close to due by that time, you could go into labour at any time.", "NTA\n\nYour husband may be relaxed about the odds of you having the baby while he's away but he doing nothing to allay your fears. I fear he is quite the opposite, and will laugh at you when you are finally induced at 41 weeks. He may think that births are commonplace but it will hit him between the eyes the moment \nyou go into labor that this is very personal indeed. \n\nAll you can do is set out that you would prefer him to stay home, or he asks his family to push the date a fortnight earlier.  Then make plans for a possible birth without him present. Sort out an alternative birthing partner and have a friend stay while he's qway. Get pragmatic about it as unfortunately tears are just going to make him and his family double down on you. Protect yourself and prepare, then it's a bonus if he's back in time.", "Slight YTA\n\nNot for not wanting to go, but for wanting your husband to not attend. You have a month (more probably) before you are due, him being gone for a few days is not that big of deal.  \n\n\nAlso for the shade about your SIL and your wedding. She was pregnant and the risks of early labor and COVID are pretty high.", "YTA. You sound really controlling. There's a slight chance of early labor. But...you're a grown woman and you don't say that your husband is also your obstetrician.", "It's 4.5 hours away by flight, but they are going to a more rural area which requires travel by train. So if there was an emergency, he'd have to take a train (not easy to get at the last minute in this particular country he's going to) and then get on a flight. The whole process would probably take 12 hours or more.", "I don't feel shady that they didn't attend, and they aren't just people. My husband only has one sibling. It was also after everyone had been vaccinated, we got married in an open space, and had a limited guest list so it was safe. This was like at the end of last year, not the peak of COVID btw. We were understanding that they couldn't attend because of their pregnancy concerns. I'm bitter not that they didn't attend, but that they don't seem to think I should be as concerned when it comes to my pregnancy. I don't expect them to change the dates but I think if they need my husband there they should consider what's appropriate for him.", "My husband is actually a doctor, so he is well aware of the risks but I think sometimes that makes them more relaxed because they know how to deal with emergencies. So he's not concerned at all. I remember reading someone ask a similar question before but most of the comments were YTAs calling her entitled - which is sort of why I was afraid I was being entitled myself. But I will discuss it with my husband again and express my concerns.", "Tbf I don't expect them to move the whole trip for me, it's just that nothing has been booked. They were literally discussing potential travel periods a week before we told them I was pregnant and never checked with my husband if he could come. I know it seems entitled to want them to shift it, but even a week or two earlier would be better for both my husband and me when it's crucial to them my husband be there. I was extremely understanding when my SIL's pregnancy prevented her from attending any of my wedding ceremonies. My BIL didn't attend either. They have both been prioritizing their pregnancy and now child for the past year and my husband and I have always accommodated and understood. I guess it just rubbed me the wrong way that it didn't strike them as an odd ask at all.", "I don't not want him to attend, I just don't like that it's so close (2-3 weeks, not one month or more) to my due date. Early labor is also common in first pregnancies. \n\nAlso, sorry if you misunderstood. The shade wasn't for her not attending, I didn't expect her to. My bitterness was because we were understanding about their concerns, but clearly that level of understanding isn't being reciprocated at all. My SIL was never left alone from the time she was 6 months pregnant. Even when 7 months, if someone had to go out for an errand I was asked to stay with her. We were all accommodating and continue to be but we understand because it's family and ultimately her happiness and comfort were the priority. That's why I'm bitter now, because I'd hoped they'd be more understanding and try to accommodate, too.\n\nETA: not that I want a babysitter 24-7, I just meant that if she had concerns and didn't want to be left alone, then she should understand why I wouldn't want to be left alone closer to my due date.", "It's far more than a slight chance. 37 weeks is full term. It's not controlling to want to have your husband present at the birth. As a husband, not as the obstetrician. What a strange comment.", "Fair enough. But it sounds like your husband doesn't think there's an issue, so he's really your roadblock. If he won't budge then go to your mother's place and hopefully the baby will arrive on time.", "Yeah, COVID had magically disappeared last year...", "Unfortunately it doesn\u2019t sound like your husband cares if he misses the birth. Since he\u2019s a doctor it\u2019s no big deal right! So he\u2019s gonna be putting his family ahead of your family with him. NTA"]}
