This was a first time pregnancy for my sister and while the dad was involved in the pregnancy and delivery, they were not a couple at the time. I will refer to him as baby daddy, but please note they are together and happy now :) \n\n4 years ago: My sister went into labour at noon , and gave birth around 7 am the next morning. I was living out of town at the time and flew in a week before her due date, to help her prepare for the birth of her child as her baby daddy was not living with her. When it was time to go to the hospital I drove her, and waited with her even tho she was not dilated enough to be admitted. The baby\u2019s dad didn\u2019t make it till sometime after supper, once my sister was admitted, and when he did arrive I took a short break but came back promptly to support my sister. By this point she had been on several types of pain killers, laughing gas, morphine, so had been doing okay with the help of medications. Her labour was not fun, it was long and drawn out. Once baby was ready he wasn\u2019t coming easy. By the time she was ready to push it was at least between 4&5am and at this point I was sitting on the couch in the delivery room while the baby daddy was sitting with her holding her hand and doing the dad job. I dozed off, for maybe 20 minutes during this time. I wasn\u2019t needed in this exact moment and could not control closing my eyes and dozing off. Shortly after my mini nap, things got serious again and they ended up needing to take my sister for an emergency c section and I was not allowed to come as they only allowed one support person during the c section. I waited at the hospital for nearly 3 hours after my nephew was born in the waiting room alone, waiting till I could go back to support my sister and new baby. I was at the hospital till nearly 4pm the next day before going back to my sisters place to shower and sleep.  My sister has never let me live down the fact I fell asleep while she was in labour.. It\u2019s just simply the rudest thing and still to this day bothers her, my nephew is almost 4. She is also pissed that I left her to go home and sleep after the rest of our family and other visitors showed up at the hospital (thinking it was an appropriate time). I just did my best, or what I thought that looked like. I recently found out I am pregnant, and my sister won\u2019t stop bringing up everything that I did wrong during her labour and delivery and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just hormones but it is driving me crazy. I did the best that I could for her and was with her the entire time and for a whole week after my nephews arrival. Am I the asshole for falling asleep ? And eventually wanting to go to sleep?  Or is she right to be upset that I dozed off, and I should have stayed even though there was visitors like my parents and baby daddy\u2019s?", "created_utc": 1701909532, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18cizaz/aitah_for_falling_asleep_while_my_sister_was_in/", "score": 142, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister's expectations are ridiculously  over-the-top. You took a week off work to help her, flew in to stay in a town you don't even live in, were there with her at the hospital for hours before the baby's father even arrived, and at the time you dozed off, the baby's father was providing her with the direct, hands-on support she wanted. I bet the week you were there before the birth, you were running around doing her chores while she basked in being a pregnant woman who gets to boss other people around. Assuming that the day she went into labor, you woke up by say 8 am, then by 5 am on the day she gave birth, you had been upright for almost 24 hours. I'm sure you were exhausted. By the time you left the hospital at 4 pm that day, you had been upright for OVER 24 hours, in fact for almost 36 hours.\n\nYour sister has placed an expectation on you equivalent to what the baby's father should do. You are not the baby's father. You didn't have an obligation to be present for ANY of her birth experience, let alone every second of it. You were there to help her out of your own love for her, stepping away from your own life and responsibilities to do so. Her expectations were inappropriate and unfair. I really think you need to stop letting her hold this over your head and tell her you are offended that after you doing so much to help her with the birth of her baby, that she has been completely ungrateful to you and treated you like an underperforming serf rather than her sister.", "NTA. I hope you have her read this. \nBeing a caretaker is exhausting. Traveling is exhausting. Being on call for someone giving birth is exhausting. Acting as the main support person during birth is incredibly exhausting. It\u2019s usually reserved for baby\u2019s parent. You didn\u2019t have an obligation yet you stepped up, anyway, when BD wasn\u2019t there. That\u2019s incredibly super nice of you. \n\nYou did your duty (again, above and beyond imo) and made sure your sister was taken care of before succumbing to sleep. Are you really expected to apologize, years later, for burning out after hours of waiting and caring? You didn\u2019t leave her alone, you weren\u2019t needed, and it sounds like it worked out well bc BD is now back in picture. \n\n(BTW Was he one of the support people? Why isn\u2019t he being blamed for being hours (?) late to the party? When he got there, shouldn\u2019t he have just taken over? Did he give inferior after care to your pre-birth care?)", "NTA but your sister is. I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s selfish and high maintenance in other areas of life too.", "NTA. The rudest thing ever is your sister continually bringing it up as if it's not a biological requirement for people to sleep, especially when you'd stayed overnight.\n She also seems to forget that you flew in a week beforehand to help her.", "NTA. You did your best and from what I can tell had been supporting her throughout this whole thing. It\u2019s not normal for people to regularly stay up for 30+ hours, and you weren\u2019t immediately needed at the time. A 20 minute nap is totally justified to me.", "I think your sister is actually mad at the baby daddy for not being there more and doing EVERYTHING that you so willingly did. It's probably far safer to be mad at you than it is to be mad at him because she still wants to be in a relationship with her.\n\nSo, here's what you do. You set a boundary. Her going on about this is stupid at this point. If she's mad, let her get a therapist. Tell her that you did your best as her sister, not her partner, and that your nephew is alive and well. Either she shuts up about it, gets professional help to learn to move past it, or you will cut contact with her.\n\nShe may also be mad that you're pregnant and now stealing the spotlight from her royal fertility. \n\nI'm so mad at her on your behalf, you don't deserve so many years of her harping on a non issue. You had to sleep. She had a whole medical team helping her plus the baby daddy.\n\nSo set a hard boundary with clear consequences. Tell her you are done being her emotional scapegoat, that she needs to get over it. (And it wasn't even that you did anything wrong). She's being ridiculous.\n\nSounds like her life is too good for her right now, and she is creating drama where none exists. Shut it down when she starts it again, and walk away from her for a few months and focus on your own pregnancy. YOU need the love and support, not some stupid imagined failing of sleeping for 20 mins.", "100% NTA .  You came a week before & stayed a week after, that alone is more than most siblings. You drove her , you stayed with her till dad came. Then you stepped back and let him be a participating father. Then you made room for others to visitors while also taking care of yourself. \nIt\u2019s not your fault her labour went long, and they only allow 1 person in for a c section. You were awake for a LONG time, you couldn\u2019t help it, and she wasn\u2019t alone. \nIt\u2019s understandable if she was a little upset/hurt when it first happened, we can blame that on hormones, but it\u2019s been 4 years she NEEDS to get over it. The world doesn\u2019t revolve around her.", "I think this is the appropriate time to tell your sister she has made her feelings very clear, the two of you have discussed this multiple times, and now she needs to stop bringing it up.  Unless she's a total asshat that should be enough.  I've got $5 on asshat, tho, ngl.", "NTA.  While her experience was vivid, for everyone else, waiting for labor and delivery is usually a long process. Falling asleep is normal. Leaving to take a break when others were there to attend her is fine. Did you let her know you were leaving, or did you just leave? It's possible the whole situation made her hyper aware and hyper sensitive. You did not mean to disrespect her but she is disrespecting you for continually bringing it up. She needs to move on and be supportive of you. I hope she doesn't choose this time to \"show you how it feels\". That would make her a major AH. Congrats on your pregnancy.", "NTA.\n\nSounds more like you passed out for less than 30 minutes at one point, while someone else was clearly there for her -- and the father of the child to boot.\n\nYou only left once others arrived and had been with her for over 24 hours by that point. She should have wanted you to go rest ffs. \n\nShe sounds ungrateful.", "NTA. Is your sister the main character in every story?", "NTA. I had an early morning birth, which means we were up all that night... after being awake and busy all day. My husband nodded off a couple of times between contractions, and I would just call his name and he'd snap awake (he was my only support person in the room as well.) It wasn't a conscious decision on his part and I can't imagine holding it against him. I obviously had something keeping me awake lol but we were both exhausted after unexpectedly being awake over 24 hours.", "NTA. She's being ridiculous, and appears to have coalesced all her big feels from the day into this one stick that she keeps hitting you with.\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong. Tell her to grow up and get the hell over it. And do not have her as a support person, because she sounds petty enough to screw with you when your baby comes.", "Lmao I literally sent my husband home to sleep after our son was born 3 weeks ago. He had taken a sleep aid the night before only to have my water break at 2:46 AM. He was understandably exhausted. Additionally, I let him at least try to sleep for the first several hours while my pitocin was kicking in and I couldn\u2019t feel anything. I took a nap too. He was focused on me once the contractions actually hurt and things were moving.\n\nMy husband is 6\u20197 and wasn\u2019t going to be able to sleep comfortably on the couch thing provided by the hospital. There was no reason for us to both be sleep deprived. We didn\u2019t even have visitors. It\u2019s okay to meet your own needs, especially when your sister wasn\u2019t even left alone.", "Wait.... you were at the hospital for almost 24 hours with her.... but she's pissed that you dozed off for 20 minutes and left when others came to be there?  Seriously?  NTA, but your sister is.", "NTA. Your sister needs to move on. I can understand her being emotional at the time, but it\u2019s been four years. She had support with her when you were napping, and it\u2019s unreasonable to expect you to be awake for days on end in case you need her, when there are other people around.", "NTA. Your sister didn't want a person, she wanted an automaton with no bodily needs.", "I\u2019m impressed you were able to fall asleep when someone was in active labor. So NTA there. You probably needed it lol.\n\nAs for the leaving, I guess you could\u2019ve asked if she needed anything else or needed you to stay but otherwise you need to leave eventually. She\u2019s being TA for saying you did everything wrong in this case.", "NTA- I fell asleep when I was in the hospital with my wife, not the labor part. It\u2019s a really long time and mostly really boring and then it becomes an incredible miracle", "Nta", "NTA. You went above and beyond, and most siblings wouldn't have done all that! You're a human, not a robot, and you did everything you could to support her.\n\nPerhaps the event was highly stressful, and there were hormones as you said, so maybe this  (hopefully uncharacteristically) entitled behavior can be chalked up to that.", "NTA. My husband, who was my only support person, and the only one I was allowed to have (COVID) fell asleep when I was in labor after about 2 hours with my second. He didn\u2019t even mean to- damn man can fall asleep any time, any place (not actually mad, just jealous). But you know what, if I had needed him at that moment I would have woken him up-he knew it and I knew it- and when it got worse I did.   I do rib him about it sometimes, but it\u2019s teasing. Is it possible your sister is more ribbing you than mad? \n\nAnyhow, care people, support people, need to take care of themselves to be able to provide care and support.  It isn\u2019t wrong to sleep, and in both cases it sounds like you picked the best time. You wouldn\u2019t have been as much help to your sister if, once everyone had left, you were as tired as she was.", "There is research which shows that women remember how they felt emotionally while in labour and delivery more than the pain etc. years later. unfortunately you made your sister feel emotionally crappy i guess and she will remember that for decades. So choose your support persons accordingly as that will be important when you go into labour. \n\nHowever, you aren't a professional and were tired, labour can last for hours and can be tough for people around the labouring person as well. \n\nNAH.", "NTA, I wish I could\u2019ve felt asleep during labor but I was in labor.", "NTA\n\nYou are not the baby daddy. If he wasn\u2019t good enough that\u2019s on her for choosing him. You were way above and beyond.", "NTA- My husband fell asleep.. I had to yell to wake him up  right before I was getting ready to push . It wasn\u2019t that serious", "NTA. Hell, I fell asleep during my own labor when they gave me some drugs. Wasn\u2019t long, but man, that nap sure helped. Your sister is delusional. \n\ni know you would never want her in the room when you deliver, but maybe call her up a week before due date\u2026\u201dso sis, when you were a week out, I shopped, mopped, vacuumed, made meals, cleaned your grout, etc. what don\u2019t you go do all that right now? Oh, and I\u2019ll call you when I\u2019m in labor and you have to listen to me and keep my company via text/FT for 30 hours without breaking connection and no sleeping.\u201d", "NTA.   If you're tired enough it doesn't take much to nod off and fall asleep.  Once you sat down and relaxed it was bound to happen after being on high alert and awake for so long.  It only makes sense you chose the time when other family arrived to go home to eat, sleep and shower.  Considering how much you were there for your sister before, during, and after her labor she shouldn't be complaining.  I hope she is just teasing and not serious.", "NTA. I was so tired with my 1st I was falling asleep in between pushes. Your sister needs to drop it and thank you for going above and beyond for. She is lucky to have you.", "NTA - tired is tired, it\u2019s hard to stay awake, especially as a spectator to what\u2019s happening.", "NTA. The child is Four! Your sister should let it go. Her complaining will not change anything. People can only stay awake so long before your body can't take it anymore. I hope your pregnancy, labor and delivery goes well. And I hope you are not asking her to do anything for you, being nagged continually about what you did wrong for years ago would not be conducive to a stress free labor.", "NTA.. your sister is being ridiculous. I never actually went into labor. My first was an emergency C-section for preeclampsia and my second was a scheduled C-section. For my first, my kids dad, my mom and my sister were all around somewhere. And my second, my mom, my sister and my sister in law. They came and went in shifts as life and jobs permitted. I was just happy to have someone present who loved me when I was scared and helpless.", "NTA. What a sense of entitlement she has! To hold onto this for 4 years is unbelievable!  You took a week off work early, flew out to support her, and you had the nerve to fall asleep at 5 am after staying up all night? She a piece of work.", "As a woman who is on her 4th term pregnancy, you are NTA. Labour is a long process. You don't have pain keeping you up, as a support person. Everyone running on literally zero hours of sleep is pointless and potentially dangerous. \n\nWhen I'm in labour I let my husband know when a good time for him to nap is. He needs to be alert enough to drive me to the hospital and make logical medical decisions for me when I'm too out of it to do so. And I'm going to be exhausted when it's all done and he is going to step in to care for baby when I'm resting. Plus the hospital doesn't even give him a bed to use so any sleep he gets there is very restless.\n\nIt is absolutely ridiculous for any pregnant person to expect a support person not to sleep for the duration of a long labour.", "NTA - I could see why she\u2019d be upset about everything the day of, or even until everything balances back out for her medically and mentally. But FOUR years later? And you only dozed off a short time after being awake for days? Notttttt the AH.", "NTA\n\nMy sister had her first baby when I was on a week of night shifts.\n\nI drove four hours down there, was ignored, got told that the baby probably wouldn\u2019t get there until the next morning with as slowly as the labor was progressing, and drove three hours back to work.\n\nBaby was apparently born just as I was clocking on, and I didn\u2019t made it back down until the following day, when I had two days rostered off. I spent an hour getting scolded for not being there sooner", "NTA. I\u2019m pretty sure everyone would say to get some rest while you can even when you\u2019re a support person. The reason you have 2 supports is so they can take shifts. Your sister sounds like she\u2019s going to be one of \u2018those\u2019 women so prepare to have to enforce some boundaries of your own.", "NTA", "NTA. I'm 59, I had 3 natural childbirths. (No drugs). Drugs do tend to lengthen delivery quite a bit. My 1st born had a low heart rate, so I had to tough it out. My advice to you? Find someone other than your sister to go in delivery with you. The last thing you need on your day is your sister standing over you harping about how you weren't good enough. Not to mention, how she will compare how much better she did for you for the rest of your life.", "NTA. Your sister is a \u201cC\u201d word.", "Oh no. YTA without a doubt. You COMPLETELY failed her. So she was left with no support or anyone to advocate for her at all in her most vulnerable moment. She had a nightmare experience, did you do one second of research on how to support someone in labor?? You should be ashamed and you need to apologize to her. Maybe once you have your baby you\u2019ll finally understand what you did.", "Stepping back, is she usually a self centered person? If so, YTA for agreeing to be there knowing how she is.  Why was your role more critical than baby daddy? \n\nNta If and only if, she\u2019s otherwise a nice, thoughtful and considerate person then, assume this reaction was pregnancy hormones or misguided frustrations. \n\nBack to YTA, if she\u2019s like this always and her reminding you about the last delivery, years later, as a joke that no one else\u2019s finds funny yet agreeing to do it again. \n\nIn summary.

Ho through everything you did, his you are not baby daddy, his dads often fall asleep with their wives in labor & how you are sick of her bringing it up. Do she needs to drop this or drop out of your life for while\u2026\u2026 until d as bf can get over this imaginary slight. \n\nThat or every time she does it, just shake your head and say \u201cpoor _____ baby daddy_____ if this how you treat me when I help you, I cannot begin to imagine how you treat him!\u201d  \u201cPoor baby daddy you must harp on things forever with him \u201c", "NTA. I had an epidural. I napped, my husband napped\u2026then they said it was time to push lol", "NTA. How ungrateful. My sister was one of my support people and drove 2 hrs one way to help, stayed I think two days. Then drove 2hrs back home cause she had to get her kids ready and came back to the hospital! You FLEW and stayed a total of two weeks!!! She should be beyond grateful! Now Imma say be petty and when you go into labor have someone call her in the middle of the night multiple times and berate her for sleeping when you\u2019re in labor. How dare she be at home in bed?!", "NTA lol my baby daddy (husband) was my only support person and even he fell asleep while I was in active labour with our second. I still laugh about it but certainly don\u2019t hold it against him. At least he was awake for the birth!", "NTA.\n\nTell your sister, BLUNTLY, to get a new tune to dance to.", "All of this.\n\nJust to add \u2014 looks like OP actually took *two* weeks off of work, since it looks like she was there for a week before her nephew\u2019s birth *and* a week after as well.\n\nAm I reading this correctly, OP? It looks like you took two weeks off work and traveled to help, and four years later, she\u2019s upset that you: 1) took a 20-minute nap break at a time when you\u2019d been awake for nearly 24 hours, and you first made sure that someone else had taken over and was actively tending to your sister in your place; and 2) went to shower when other visitors came to spend time with her.\n\nUm. NTA. She\u2019s being ridiculous.", ">Your sister has placed an expectation on you equivalent to what the baby's father should do. You are not the baby's father.\n\nWell yes, but in most cases the baby\u2019s father is *actually in a relationship with the mother*.  In this case, they were not a couple. \n\nThe only person in that room who had a close familial relationship with the mother was OP, so it\u2019s not that out of line to expect that she would have played the role that the father normally would.", "I think you nailed it. SIL is angry that BD wasn't there, but they're a happy couple now and she can't be pissy with him. So she's re-directing that anger at the other person who was there. At least that's my guess.\n\nEdited to add: NTA by a long shot.", "And it looks like OP stayed for a week after, too.", ">I hope she doesn't choose this time to \"show you how it feels\". \n\nI wouldn't give her the opportunity.  Hell I probably wouldn't call her until baby has arrived and I've rested, cleaned up and snuggled my kid for a good six hours.\n\nBut I'm well past my family's bullshit. If they bring up something petty like needing sleep after being awake for the better part of a day (or more), I'd remind them that sleep deprivation is a torture technique and then let it drop. (Having worked graveyard for a decade and being constantly sleep deprived, I'm mad at myself for never bringing it up) and then anyone who says it again, or agrees, gets put in a very low contact/info diet list.", ">and the father of the child to boot.\n\nSupport people are there to support *the mother*. Being the father of the child doesn\u2019t count for shit if he doesn\u2019t have a close relationship with the mother. It\u2019s not surprising at all that she wanted support from her sister over a guy that she wasn\u2019t even dating.", "I mean, I took a little cat nap while in labor just before pushing. But I was fairly numbed by an epidural\u2026", ">Why was your role more critical than baby daddy?\n\nWhy are you surprised that a woman in labor would prefer the support of her own sister instead of a guy she isn\u2019t even dating?", "> it\u2019s not that out of line to expect that she would have played the role that the father normally would.\n\nIt is out of line and utterly insane to have that expectation. The father is expected to play the father role because it is *his* child being birthed, not because he has a close relationship with the mother. \n\nThe sister had her whole family come supoort her after the birth + other visitors (friends I'm assuming). All of those people were sound asleep in their beds while she gave birth, while op sat in the hospital with her and was there for her through the entire process. Op went above and beyond, and frankly her sister doesn't deserve her kindness if this is how she treats op after the fact.", "I would not fault the father for a twenty minute cat nap", "I was in labor with my first for 72 hours before the emergency c section. My husband slept many MANY hours waiting for baby to come. I sent him for food and coffee a couple of times (I was not allowed to eat due to the epidural). This is normal. \n\nOP\u2019s sister, not so much.", "I don't think it's out of line to hope that OP would provide support, which she did. But, providing emotional support to her sister does not necessitate her behaving as if she were the baby's father. She's there as a gift to her sister. A really big gift, considering she took time off work. For her sister to criticize the gift and complain that the OP is rude, and that OP's gift of self should have been even bigger, is presumptuous.", "Yes it is. No one EXPECTS all of that from a sibling unless they are very entitled. If it's offered that's amazingly generous. A normal amount of family support is checking in before and after the birth, dropping off a meal or two to help out, coming to visit in hospital if that's wanted, coming to visit after the birth if that's wanted. Some family members offer to come over and do a few chores or watch baby so mum can have a nap but that's unusual.  2 weeks off work to look after the new mum is exceptional.", "When I was induced for my first pregnancy the drs gave hubby the option to stay by my side or go home and try and get a good night rest and the Dr even said to him \"you will be of more use to her when the time comes if you are rested.\" \n\nHubby did leave but went to a mates house instead of either of our parents because he was the closet to the hospital (I had to move back to home town temporarily for the birth due to hubby's career at the time) and couldn't sleep anyway.\n\nOPs sister is bat crap crazy if she thinks that demanding OP be awake for 36hrs was acceptable", "My third child, I managed to nap while on gas and my husband sat down for about 3 hours and had some coffee and sandwiches. I kept waking up for contractions and wondering when the hell he'd eaten the food and where was mine. Hell, I even woke up mid contraction to find him napping. Still hilarious to me that everything seemed to skip time."]}
