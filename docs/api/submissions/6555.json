I am organizing a birthday party at a bar in the city we live in for a mutual friend of ours. I rented out a portion of the bar with bottle service so it cost about 2 grand. A little over 20 people were invited so I think each person paid around 80-90$? I\u2019m not quite sure what the number exactly was as people paid me a few weeks ago. \n\nMara was one of the people who paid me. She said something about misreading the dates and she has some big thing with her sister that night and she could not attend. The fight we are having is Mara wants her money back. Well she can\u2019t have her money back. Why?\n\nBecause I already paid. Essentially I would have to give her the money out of my own pocket to refund her. Here is where I think Mara is being pretty shitty to me. She\u2019s insisting I can give her the money out of my pocket and using my life situation against me. \n\nI come from decent money. I currently live on my own which I pay for pretty much all my bills, but my parents still send me a little bit of fun money a month. Not much like 200 bucks. This is honestly how I paid my share of the bar. Mara knows this. \n\nShe\u2019s been bad mouthing me, calling me mommy\u2019s money and shit. She\u2019s accusing me of being a spoiled selfish prick because I \u201cknow\u201d she\u2019s worked for everything pretty much since highschool. And \u201cthe money means a lot more\u201d to her than it does to me I guess. \n\nI don\u2019t think my situation matters at all and that is just extra details. Her poor planning is not my problem and just because I technically can afford to pay her doesn\u2019t mean I should. At the end of the day, she paid for it and didn\u2019t realize her scheduling conflict and that\u2019s on her. \n\nThe last comment I had to her was \u201cif you claim you work so hard, maybe go to work and make your money back instead of trying to shake down your friend\u201d and we haven\u2019t talked since.\n\nEdit:typo\n\nEdit 2: other thought about refunding, like wouldn\u2019t me refunding her now set the precedent that if anyone else had an issue, I\u2019d now have to refund them too ?\n\nEdit 3: because I guess I must make this clear, I told everyone 2 days in advance that I would be paying the bar. Everyone said it was chill.", "created_utc": 1672935683, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10430kb/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_friend_her_money/", "score": 581, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your life situation doesn't matter.", "NTA.  You already paid and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s relevant that you are financially better off - she\u2019s the one who made the mistake, and you shouldn\u2019t be out of pocket for it.  If she knows anybody else that can take her place (or you do), that would be the better thing. Otherwise, it should be absorbed by all (which logistically is much harder, but also the right thing).", "NTA. The polite thing to do is send out a group message asking if anyone has a friend who can \u201cbuy out\u201d her place, but if there isn\u2019t a replacement it\u2019s her loss. I organise group activities all the time and nobody has asked for their money back from my pocket, but I always try to help them sell their place to another friend.", "She should consider it a contribution to your mutual friend\u2019s birthday party.

Then they could pay her portion and you could pass the money back.", "NTA. This is like putting a nonrefundable deposit down for a dinner party. She put the deposit down, she doesn\u2019t get it back because she decided she didn\u2019t want to go. \n\nAlso let\u2019s say this was like a group gift. She can\u2019t take her money back when the gifts already been paid for just because she decided to not go to the party.", "NTA. She basically bought a ticket to the club. Tickets to things are usually non refundable unless the event is canceled. If she wants her money back she needs to sell her ticket to someone else that would want to go/is invited. Her mistake, her loss. It sucks but she can\u2019t expect you to make up for her mistake just because money means less to you. I think the nice thing as a friend if you really can spare the money would be to refund her for her mistake since obviously this is stressing her out but you definitely don\u2019t have to and aren\u2019t the ah for not. Especially after she started bad mouthing you for not.", "NTA. If you told her once you paid the bar it was final and she didn't object then I think that is on her. She made a commitment. If you want to try to help her out you could create a group chat and inform everyone that she is flaking out and request everyone send her $4 to cover her portion of the tab ($80\u00f720 people). But it would be a request and I think that would be an individual decision made by all participants. They might be on a budget and unable to contribute more than originally asked.\n\nThe most important part of this post though is that she holds you in contempt and feels entitled to your money. This is not a great quality in a friend. She also does not feel responsible for her own commitments. Also not a great quality in a friend. \n\nYou owe her nothing. If you want to be nice you can offer her $4 as your share of the bill. But I don't think I could be friends with someone like her.", "She shouldn\u2019t expect you to pay it out of your own pocket.

But yeah, her approach was all wrong - to say the least - so I don't blame you a bit for refusing to refund her. \n\nIt's part of being an adult that sometimes there are things in life where fucking up means you're out whatever money you paid and you just have to deal with it - this is one of those things.", "NTA she's at fault for mixing up the dates, if she told you sooner she couldn't attend I doubt there would've been a problem with giving back her money, but the money has already been spent. People are shitting on you and saying you shouldn't have hosted a party if you couldn't pay for it but that's the stupidest thing ever. You organised it and everyone was fine with pitching in on the price, your friend had enough money to pitch in too, this is clearly not about her not being able to afford it. If she couldn't afford it she wouldn't have decided to come in the first place. Yeah it's shitty for her that she lost the money but it's not on you to babysit her and make sure she got her dates right, her money was gone and since it was her fault for not being able to attend she's the one who has to lose the money. If you were the one who mixed up the dates when inviting her and she couldn't go because of that then you'd be the one to pay her back as it'd be your fault, but right now you've done nothing wrong and don't deserve people calling you the a-hole", "I backed out of a bridesmaid role and never even thought to ask for my money back for the bachelorette trip or bridal shower.

There was a chance to get the money back before the bar was paid, but that point has been passed now.", "NTA- but can you get another friend to take her place maybe?", "NTA\n\nThis is no different than messing up the time and dare for something that requires a deposit. The fact that she's using your family's money against you shows that she has nothing else to use against you.", "NTA. Check your schedule before putting money down for an event. And, maybe an unpopular opinion, but I don\u2019t think your personal situation matters at all.", "Nta. I'm sorry but she made the mistake here. It sucks but her having the dates wrong literally isn't on you. If she bought a concert ticket or something, she would not get the money back either. Her lack of management isn't your responsibility.", "NTA there are consequences to actions even if it was a mistake on reading the dates wrong", "NTA. This is an unfortunate situation for the friend but just cuz op was the one that gathered the money and paid the booking fee doesn\u2019t mean he has to personally pay the friend. If everyone else agrees to pay op 3-4$ more, they can all pay the friend back. It would have been N-A-H but the friend\u2019s reaction is way out of line.", "NTA she put down a deposit. Her poor planning is not your responsibility.", "NTA \n\nHer scheduling conflict has nothing to do with you and is not your problem to fix. How entitled of her to think that because SHE had an issue that YOU HAD to fix it. I would limit contact with her in the future if it were me!", "NTA. Money was exchanged for a service. Service will be provided. The fact she can't attend  to get the service is out of your control and totally on hers.

She's TA.", "I missed a bachelorette party for a friend because I had some family issues come up. I had already paid for my portion of activities, hotel, etc. I didn\u2019t ask for my money back and told the MOH organizing to let me know whatever my portion was and I would still cover it. The prices were set on how many people were planned/confirmed to attend. It would have been a dick move for me to say fuck it give me my money back. NTA your friend needs to grow up and learn to be an adult.", "NTA. She should look at the money as a gift to your friend towards their party.", "NTA. Why is she expecting you alone to refund her from your own pocket? You shouldn\u2019t have to shoulder the cost of her mistake alone just because you were in charge of renting the section. If anything, you did them a huge favor by being the one to book it. Since the price was per person, if she wants her money back it would be more fair to have everyone pay a little more to cover her share instead of you personally covering it.

It\u2019s up to you how you use the money you\u2019re gifted.", "NTA.  You aren't being nice about it either to be sure, but bottom line she is a grown adult who made a mistake and losing that money is the consequence.", "NTA unless someone else can cover her share", "INFO - did you just decide to do the bar thing & ask everyone if they wanted to chip in OR was it a mutual decision by the entire group to rent this bar?", "NTA. Sorry to say for Mara that she gave money for a service that was also a present for someone else. It\u2019s unfortunate she didn\u2019t check the dates before she gave you money, and didn\u2019t realize her mistake before you paid for it, but personally I don\u2019t think her being unable to attend in this situation is a good enough reason for a refund. Like, it\u2019s a gift for a service mainly for someone else. \n\nOthers might not see it that way, but at the very least she\u2019s certainly not entitled to a refund directly from you because you happen to be organizing it. This was her screw up. The only fair way for her to get her money back would be for her to contact everyone else that\u2019s invited and ask that they buy her out. She probably knows that would make her look bad though so she\u2019s not. You\u2019re right, if you bought her out individually, it could easily fall all right back in your lap if other people ask for refunds. That\u2019s not okay position for you to end up in. \n\nAs for her attitude, is she really going around saying these things about you over $2400 a year?? That\u2019s very nice of your parents to provide this to you, but no, your life is not made or broken over $2400 a year. This doesn\u2019t make you some rich trust fund kid or something. It\u2019s none of her business that you receive that money from your parents and it\u2019s certainly not her place to tell anyone your business either. Calling someone \u201cspoiled\u201d over that just screams of jealousy on her part.\n\nHold your ground. If she comes back at you let her know she\u2019s welcome to attempt to collect $5 from everyone else and see she\u2019s willing to let her reputation take a hit.

If Mara had the money for the deposit then, why does she suddenly not have it now she has a scheduling conflict?

OP's role in this was simply being a(n unpaid?) party planner. \n\nMara is the one who made a mistake.

If the price per person comes out to 90 bucks, charge everyone 100 and give refunds if everyone pays up and comes. Gives you a buffer for situations like this. Even worse, sometimes people are just straight up freeloaders and it's impossible to get them to pay.

Good on you for putting the effort in to plan the whole thing. It's often a thankless job.

Thing is, even if she's not technically owed it, it's the type of thing you do for a friend. She made a mistake and the typical reddit response is \"well it's her fault so screw her no work for you!\" But when someone's a friend, you try to compromise and help out. And she has a point with the money comment. She is an asshole about how she's badmouthing you and such, but 24 and getting almost $2,500 a year from parents \"for fun\" is a big privilege that you seem to be a bit flippant about. Again, just because you have it doesn't mean she's entitled to it or entitled to bad mouthing you (and also I admit she's generally more in the wrong in this situation), but I'm going to push back against the general reddit trend and say friends should act a bit more like friends than she and honestly you too are in this situation.", "Why can\u2019t you just text everyone and let them know they need to bring $xx more? \n\nThat\u2019s a normal thing to do.\n\nThis is too simple to be an issue.", "Yea you are.

I am organizing a birthday party at a bar in the city we live in for a mutual friend of ours. I rented out a portion of the bar with bottle service so it cost about 2 grand. A little over 20 people were invited and taco\u2019s so I think each person paid around 80-90$? I\u2019m not quite sure what the number exactly was as people paid me a few weeks ago. \n\nMara was one of the people who paid me. She said something about misreading the dates and she has some big thing with her sister that night and she could not attend. The fight we are having is Mara wants her money back. Well she can\u2019t have her money back. Why?\n\nBecause I already paid. Essentially I would have to give her the money out of my own pocket to refund her. Here is where I think Mara is being pretty shitty to me. She\u2019s insisting I can give her the money out of my pocket and using my life situation against me. \n\nI come from decent money. I currently live on my own which I pay for pretty much all my bills, but my parents still send me a little bit of fun money a month. Not much like 200 bucks. This is honestly how I paid my share of the bar. Mara knows this. \n\nShe\u2019s been bad mouthing me, calling me mommy\u2019s money and shit. She\u2019s accusing me of being a spoiled selfish prick because I \u201cknow\u201d she\u2019s worked for everything pretty much since highschool. And \u201cthe money means a lot more\u201d to her than it does to me I guess. \n\nI don\u2019t think my situation matters at all and that is just extra details. Her poor planning is not my problem and just because I technically can afford to pay her doesn\u2019t mean I should. At the end of the day, she paid for it and didn\u2019t realize her scheduling conflict and that\u2019s on her. \n\nThe last comment I had to her was \u201cif you claim you work so hard, maybe go to work and make your money back instead of trying to shake down your friend\u201d and we haven\u2019t talked since.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But I think the friendship might be over anyway.", "NTA. If she is so hard up for the amount then she couldn't really afford to go when she thought she was free. In fact, since she brought up the difference in your financials, it makes me wonder whether she did actually mistake the date or whether she regretted handing over the money and tried to cover her bad money decision with a story.

Even if your parents were giving you 500 a month, it wouldn\u2019t change anything. It\u2019s still not your responsibility to reimburse her for a mistake she made on her own. Your job was to collect payments and pay the bill. Also, your upbringing has nothing to do with her and irrelevant to the situation.
