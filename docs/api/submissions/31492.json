We\u2019ve been friends for over 20 years and she knows me better than anyone else. We would go on vacation together twice a year, meet up every other weekend and text/phone in between. The past few years, we haven\u2019t been as close and I really don\u2019t know what changed. I tend to blame myself for anything that goes wrong in my life so I\u2019m thinking I must have done something?! Towards the end of last year, I tried to arrange to go on vacation with her and she said she didn\u2019t want to leave her dad because he was sick and then she arranged to go away with other friends the same week I had suggested we go somewhere. She never gets in touch with me - I always make first contact. A few months ago she told me she got engaged - I didn\u2019t even know she was dating anyone. It turns out she only met the guy a few weeks before he asked her to marry him. Since then I\u2019ve messaged her on a weekly basis asking to meet up and catch up but she always replies with \u201cyes, let\u2019s arrange a get together soon\u201d. When I suggest dates for meeting up, she just ignores me. I was out with a mutual friend a week ago and she was chatting about meeting up with my best friend and her fianc\u00e9 the weekend before. I was so hurt. I\u2019ve received my wedding invite and there is a huge part of me that is considering declining. I\u2019m really struggling financially and I don\u2019t see the point of paying out hundreds of pounds to go to the wedding of someone who is ignoring me.

It's still not a valid reason to ignore you and I wouldn't go if I were you.", "NTA.  Ask her to discuss the issues you laid out here, either in telephone or in person.
