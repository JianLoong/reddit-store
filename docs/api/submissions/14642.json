But it's costly and very difficult from what I can find.", "That's as ridiculous to me as someone saying you should only date within your race or social class. I can't even imagine thinking an age difference matters at all between adults. I might not want to date someone who makes ten times less than me, is a foot taller than me, or follows a different religion than me. But those preferences mean nothing to anyone else and I'm fine with that. You might have an issue dating someone significantly older or younger than you, that doesn't mean anyone else has to abide by your personal preference. Who am i to tell two adults they shouldn't date each other for any reason, age, race, or whatever? And who are you to push your beliefs onto me? \n\nIf age is a deciding factor in your relationships so be it. But I find that mindset just as gross and creepy as you do age gaps. I won't judge anyone for dating another adult no matter if one is 90 and the other is 20. So what? If it doesn't matter to them it doesn't matter to me.  I won't let you tell me who I should date, and I certainly won't push my preferences onto you.

He was probably just being defensive in the moment because he felt accused of impropriety for a moment where that was a real possibility even if it wasn\u2019t close to the reality. I hope that he eventually becomes less defensive and is able to learn from your reaction that those situations require transparency with parents. It\u2019s not about suspecting anyone of anything, it\u2019s just about having clear, healthy boundaries and expectations all around.\n\nNo, you shouldn\u2019t have cancelled the trip. You should not assume that your son is not disappointed or hurt by the cancellation. He may think he is somehow at fault or that his mom doesn\u2019t want to have a relationship with him. This may be a semiconscious perspective they he doesn\u2019t share with you but still impacts his life. It\u2019s better to give him the message that his mom loves him and wants to spend time with him and to facilitate that as much as possible.\n\nFinally, there must be a lot more to that origin story that would make it make more sense. It sounds like you were in a relationship where the age and maturity gap created an unhealthy power dynamic. It is weird that your initial agreement didn\u2019t support her presence in the child\u2019s life. The way you summarized it makes it seem like you used a young woman for her womb and then tried to cut her out of her child\u2019s life.

They\u2019re going to twist everything any one of us says to fit their own narrative. Bottom line, OP\u2019s ex and her husband have no rights and cannot just not tell OP something because they don\u2019t believe he\u2019s \u201cthe real dad\u201d. I\u2019m pretty sure the exes husband is trying to phase OP out of the kids head as dad and replace him with himself."]}
