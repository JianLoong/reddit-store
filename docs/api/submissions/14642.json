I guess at some point they went swimming and Cameron decided he wanted to go commando in his jeans afterwards. At the Easter event, he climbed a tree and had a zipper accident.\n\nIt didn't bother him until later that night. He was way too embarrassed to tell his mom so he told Steven. Steven put curoxen on his cut. When they dropped him off the next day and I was giving him a bath, he told me that he got an ouchie and Steven put medicine on it. \n\nI don't think anything weird happened but what bugged me was that Steven didn't tell me. I did call him and said that he really should had called me the minute he found out or at least when dropped him off. \n\nHe told me to get over it and Cameron was in pain all evening and waited until he had a private moment to tell Steven about it. It was not a big deal. I said, no offense you're not the dad. He said well neither are you. Cameron isn't even my biological son and he thinks it was weird that I convinced his wife to give up custody.\n\nSo now I'm limiting contact with them.

You may not be biologically related, but you ARE his father and Steven ought to respect that. Your ex didn't have to agree to this, she made this decision as well. So if you feel you need to limit contact, then by all means, do what your parental instincts are telling you to do.", "NTA - I think any contact needs to be supervised since the step dad has some strange ideas about what constitutes custody and primary care giver status (regardless of DNA).  Cameron is your son by definition regardless of DNA.  Cameron comes first and clearly Steven has decided disrespecting Cameron\u2019s relationship with you and disregarding you legal status as Cameron\u2019s sole parent is acceptable.  This line of thinking could damage Cameron emotionally.", "NTA\n\nIf your son doesn't care if he sees them, limit contact.\n\nHis mother signed her rights away; let her live her life.  \n\nWhen/if Cameron gets old enough to ask questions, you can deal with that then.\n\nHugs", "NTA - his bio-mom is not his mother, she has signed away her rights to be his parent.  It is kind of you to allow her and her new family to spend time with your son, however they overstepped in a pretty big way by not telling you about an injury he incurred while in their care.  If your son doesn't care about whether or not he spends time with them, I'd try to limit the visits.  \n\nIf you're feeling unsure, maybe just consult with an attorney to confirm that all the ducks are in a row and they have no legal standing to enforce any type of visitation.", "NTA\n\nIt's not surprising your son told the stepdad before his mom, he is relatively unfamiliar with both of them but you are a male figure so I can see why he chose the stepfather.\n\nYour son not mentioning the incident to you i can't comment on much either, I sm don't know your son's personality but it didn't inherently raise any alarm bells to me. \n\nRaising it as an issue to the step father is reasonable, they should tell you when your kid gets hurt under their care, even when it's something minor like that. Perhaps you were argumentative or something in how you did it, but thats neither here nor there\n\nHis comments were way out of line, and conveniently absolve your ex of any responsibility in the arrangements. Fuck that, they 100% need to get their attitude right if you are going to trust them with your son. \n\nIf this is the shit they are comfortable saying to your face who knows what they might say to your son, and at a very impressionable time in his life.", "NTA, it's clear Steven doesn't respect your position as Cameron's father. He should have told you about the injury. Now I'm wondering what messages Cameron is getting when you aren't around.", "NTA\n\nIt's insane that a functioning adult taking care of someone else's kid would not tell them they had an accident and got hurt.\n\nIts super disrespectful to say that to you as well on the dad front. You don't need an internet nobody telling you that you are 100% his dad but you are mate.\n\n Tell your ex why you are limiting contact and that if she wants a relationship with Cameron it's entirely dependant on all three of you talking this out. If she doesn't get why this was gross on multiple levels she can get lost as well.", "NTA. Fathers don't have to be biological to be fathers. To assume otherwise is like telling parents who adopt their kids (like appears to be the case here) aren't really parents. I mean you've been there every day for 7 years, that's fatherhood right there.", "NTA. I would tell the mom if she wants to resume regular contact then Steven owes you an apology for what he said, and in the future you should keep communications about your son limited to just the mom", "Even if it was completely innocent, if I had to come in contact with ANY child\u2019s genitals, I\u2019m telling that parent IMMEDIATELY so there are no misunderstandings as to why & what happened. Steven was way out of line, as he should have done this or at the very least told mom to relay what had happened. The way he so nonchalantly says you are not the father would bother me bcuz what will he say to your son? NTA", "NTA, there is no justification for what he said.", "NTA. That would have been the last thing \"Steve\" ever said to me or my kid. There is no coming back from something like that. It is clear he will be a compeltley toxic influence on your child.

You were and still are way above your ex-wife in experience and power due to your age, and if you can handle being a single parent it means you earn good money, too, so that's even more power. \n\nI'm with Steve on that one, its weird AF, but I'd like to know your reasoning before I give my \"verdict\".", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe I am exaggerating, but sounds to me  that Steve is trying to strange your son from you and get him closer to his mother since DNA is what matters for Steve. \nThat was this rude comment about you not being a dad, then he thinks the custody agreement is weird... Hmmm.", "^ yes, this. NTA. DNA has no bearing on if you are a parent to a child. If it did, adoption wouldn't be a thing.\n\nMy (45f) dad (79m) is actually my step-dad. He became my dad when I was 2. My mom and he split for 2 years when I was a teen and then got back together. My mom passed when I was 24. So, in total, he was technically only my step-dad for 20 years. Yet, to this day, (43 years and counting) he is my dad. I am his daughter. \n\nSteven needs to leave that subject alone or not be allowed to visit with your son, and the mother needs to back you up on this.", "He did mention it to him when he came home.

I wanted a baby and was either going to adopt or use a surrogacy. Cameron's bio dad was some young 20 something kid on vacation from Visby. He isn't a factor in Cameron's life.", "Because I wanted a kid and my estranged wife was pregnant with one that she didn't want after all. She looked into putting him up for adoption but the potential parents rubbed her the wrong way. I was already looking into adoption or surrogacy so having a bio kid wasn't a deal breaker.

I don't care if she was 18, that's an adult on every corner of planet earth. She is 100% responsible for her decisions. And her husband is no better than she is with regards to ops child.

Or they can go back to being full time strangers, permanently.", "My father in law adopted my husband after he married his mom. After they divorced the custody\u2019s battle got nasty. He was awarded sole custody of my husband and his little brother. His mom dipped and they didn\u2019t see her for years after.

Did you love her when you got married or did you see her as a means to get the kid you wanted?\n\nIt's still quite iffy, tbh, but if we see her as a surrogate mother or a \"Juno-like\" situation then rather than you getting married with her for love, yeah, it's a bit less iffy, still iffy, but a bit less so.\n\nWhere did the sudden interest in her son came from? Did you push it? Because if so... that's problematic and it makes me lean more towards a soft YTA, because one disagrement where both of you were cruel to each other and you pull the kid away after pushing him towards her? That's even crueler.\n\nIf it came from her then I'd be leaning strongly to YTA. It's HER son, you're NOT his biological father, that's a fact, and what you told Steve is equally cruel after he took care of your adopted kid, he could've just as well just left the wound be as he truly has no obligation to the kid.

Stop romanticizing motherhood.\n\nAnd from his answer, it seems he used her as a surrogate mother, probably had been pushing for that. He's a good ten years older than her, why didn't he find a woman his age, for starters? His idea was to have a family, he never mentions truly loving her. It sounds weird AF.\n\nAlso, he could've forgotten to tell him? Parents CAN and DO overreact.", "I literally said \"from the beginning\", I think that he never loved his wife and seems that it's reciprocal since her cheating.", "The same reason he doesn't have to marry another man, or someone of a different race.

That's something parents don't do.", "The problem with age gaps, regardless if I get downvoted or not, is that there's an imbalanced power dynamic.
