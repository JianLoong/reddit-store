As such, we needed to upsize our family car. Being a middle-aged parent with several children, I had accepted the fact that we\u2019d probably buy a minivan or, at the very least, some sort of boring crossover. Unfortunately, my wife wasn\u2019t very receptive to any of these options. Instead, she found this 2013 Mercedes GL that she absolutely fell in love with.\n\nMaybe I should have been firmer, but it\u2019s difficult to argue with a pregnant lady, especially one who sold the idea of a \u201cluxury car\u201d to your children. So, reluctantly, I went forward with the plan. It also made sense on some level to get a car my wife would like since it would double as her personal car in addition to our family car.\n\nIn the 6 years we\u2019ve owned this car, it\u2019s been an absolute money pit. It's not an exaggeration when I say that every few months I need to drop thousands of dollars into it just to keep it running. Over the past year, it has caused us so much trouble, in fact, that we don\u2019t even take it on vacations anymore. We just rent a car instead. I am convinced at this point all this car is good for is inducing stress and causing headaches. My wife, on the other hand, still thinks it\u2019s an \u201cadequate car\u201d in her words.\n\nThis morning, when I was wrapping up my call shift, I got a call from my wife telling me that her car wouldn\u2019t start. She tried a few times, and our eldest son (M16) tried, and neither of them could get it started. Because of this, I needed to get home right away so that my wife could use my personal car to get our kids to school and go to work.\n\nOnce I had my shower and ate some food, I went out to check on the Benz, and of course, it didn\u2019t start. About 20 minutes after checking myself, my wife started texting me, saying that I should probably call our mechanic as we needed the car up and running soon. I messaged her back, saying that I didn\u2019t think getting it fixed would be such a good idea since it would just break down again in a few weeks.\n\nShe then called me, saying that I needed to come up with a solution if I didn\u2019t want to get the car fixed, so I told her that we should sell it and try buying something else. She then started talking about how the market isn\u2019t good, how the kids love the car, and that we just need to find a better mechanic.\n\nI told her that the points she brought up didn\u2019t address what has become a long-term problem and that investing more money into the car was a bad idea, and therefore, I could not support that plan. She then told me that I was being argumentative and uncooperative and needed to be less difficult. Before she left as her class was about to start, she told me that ultimately it was her decision to make since it was her car.\n\nAITA?\n\nI had to take a power nap after last night, but I have crunched some numbers.\n\nIn the last 18 months, we've spent at least $8327.65 in repairs.\n\nThe car's value now is probably around 20-25k, my wife seems to think that the only fair price is +30k", "created_utc": 1704722417, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191lu9n/aita_for_refusing_to_get_my_wifes_car_fixed/", "score": 152, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
