As such, we needed to upsize our family car. Being a middle-aged parent with several children, I had accepted the fact that we\u2019d probably buy a minivan or, at the very least, some sort of boring crossover. Unfortunately, my wife wasn\u2019t very receptive to any of these options. Instead, she found this 2013 Mercedes GL that she absolutely fell in love with.\n\nMaybe I should have been firmer, but it\u2019s difficult to argue with a pregnant lady, especially one who sold the idea of a \u201cluxury car\u201d to your children. So, reluctantly, I went forward with the plan. It also made sense on some level to get a car my wife would like since it would double as her personal car in addition to our family car.\n\nIn the 6 years we\u2019ve owned this car, it\u2019s been an absolute money pit. It's not an exaggeration when I say that every few months I need to drop thousands of dollars into it just to keep it running. Over the past year, it has caused us so much trouble, in fact, that we don\u2019t even take it on vacations anymore. We just rent a car instead. I am convinced at this point all this car is good for is inducing stress and causing headaches. My wife, on the other hand, still thinks it\u2019s an \u201cadequate car\u201d in her words.\n\nThis morning, when I was wrapping up my call shift, I got a call from my wife telling me that her car wouldn\u2019t start. She tried a few times, and our eldest son (M16) tried, and neither of them could get it started. Because of this, I needed to get home right away so that my wife could use my personal car to get our kids to school and go to work.\n\nOnce I had my shower and ate some food, I went out to check on the Benz, and of course, it didn\u2019t start. About 20 minutes after checking myself, my wife started texting me, saying that I should probably call our mechanic as we needed the car up and running soon. I messaged her back, saying that I didn\u2019t think getting it fixed would be such a good idea since it would just break down again in a few weeks.\n\nShe then called me, saying that I needed to come up with a solution if I didn\u2019t want to get the car fixed, so I told her that we should sell it and try buying something else. She then started talking about how the market isn\u2019t good, how the kids love the car, and that we just need to find a better mechanic.\n\nI told her that the points she brought up didn\u2019t address what has become a long-term problem and that investing more money into the car was a bad idea, and therefore, I could not support that plan. She then told me that I was being argumentative and uncooperative and needed to be less difficult. Before she left as her class was about to start, she told me that ultimately it was her decision to make since it was her car.\n\nAITA?\n\nI had to take a power nap after last night, but I have crunched some numbers.\n\nIn the last 18 months, we've spent at least $8327.65 in repairs.\n\nThe car's value now is probably around 20-25k, my wife seems to think that the only fair price is +30k", "created_utc": 1704722417, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191lu9n/aita_for_refusing_to_get_my_wifes_car_fixed/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She can't keep using your car as you need it, and she needs to come to terms with using a car with your joint budgets", "Whatever she spends in the car, you tell her you're taking the same amount out of the joint account as your own \"play money\".  After all if she wants to waste the money, then you should get to also.\n\nBuy yourself some toys.", "Do this and update!", "Well then she has to decide if it is her car or the family car. She can't have it both ways(i mean she can't say she is the only one who decides what happens with the car while at the same time treating all expenses as family expenses)", "Then get a reasonable family car. She shouldn\u2019t be this financially irresponsible and say it\u2019s a family problem. Get a few cars/vans that are a reasonable attractive option for the family. She needs to compromise not you giving in to whatever she wants.", "A 6 year old car shouldn't be breaking down all the time. Hell, my car is 24 yrs old and doesn't break down.", "I was actually given one for work.\n\nSo far so good.  \nI can\u2019t speak for the newest of the new models, but it seems like it should last.\nThe engine design is interesting with the heads being on the sides, it probably needs head gaskets as regular maintenance every hundred thousand miles or so.\nIt does tend to burn oil though.", "It's a 10 year old vehicle with mechanical issues, any dealership that buys it is going to turn around and sell it wholesale to get it off their inventory.\n\nI would suggest you go onto Peddle (it is a car buying app) and see what they offer for it.  Any dealership you trade it into will maybe give you a few hundred more for it.  And show your wife that number.\n\nIt is concerning that your wife would rather hold onto a unreliable car that will leave her and the kids stranded, then to be driving something that is safe and functional.", "Can you afford a new car? Again, I don\u2019t think this is about the car itself. If so, why does she think she wont want a newer car?", "The dealership is going to low ball for the same reason you want to get rid of it.  That car is costing you more than it\u2019s worth (which 100% means you move on).  I\u2019m guessing she is in love with the fact that it\u2019s a \u201cLuxury\u201d vehicle and doesn\u2019t want to get a new car because you will most likely buy something that to her isn\u2019t considered high end enough.   She\u2019s thinking to much about herself and not enough about your family situation.   As others noted, best solution might be to fully dissociate yourself from the car.  Ie if it breaks down it\u2019s 100% on her to handle getting it fixed. I\u2019d bet after 1 repair she would be done with it.", "In my view, your significantly greater contribution to household finances matters here, since the issue here is that her dream car is an unacceptable drain on household finances.  The fact that the account is joint/separate doesn't matter.  My wife and I have never had a joint account, but we have almost always contributed approximately equally to household finances.  The contribution is what counts; accounts are just mechanics.  We also tend to agree on financial/household stuff, though, which is good.  Anyway, NTA.", "This. OP needs to show her the math, the time costs, switching cars, etc. Lay it out objectively.", "And he\u2019ll have to ferry the kids around", "That's divorce territory right there, preventing her access to joint funds", "She can still sign a note\u2026.", "It\u2019s not a six year old car. It\u2019s an eleven year old car which they bought six years ago.", "If we sell her car, we should be able to add enough money to buy something far nicer. Convincing her to sell it however is the hard part", "I agree, he should divorce her if shes going to go behind his back and soend his money in her car.", "It's not his money though, it's marital assets. He has already acknowledged her car is the family car; his expectations are that she ferries the kids around.\n\nThe family car is a family responsibility and it's correct you use joint funds in it", "He says its majority his. Youre really defending this woman sinking the cars value into the car over 6 years when any logical person wouldve called it after 3 years of this happening at most. Are you telling me youd actually put 15k into a 20k car? The car is literally being refused to be used and theyre renting a car, and youre still defending this? If i had to get another car because mine wasnt reliable i wouldnt keep the unreliable car around. \n\nIts her decision to sell the car if shes the one paying for it. If you want it to be a joint account then its a joint decision and unfortunately shes not prepared to have an in-depth conversation about the car. So it falls to him.", "The majority being his is probably only correct because the pay gap is ridiculously unfair meaning he earns more, that doesn\u2019t mean at all that he works harder.\n\nBut a joint account nullifies his claims that \u201cthe majority is mine\u201d in his statement. As joint accounts are exactly that, the money within a joint account all becomes JOINT money. Aka - His and hers, despite who put what into it", "If it's money earned during the marriage, it's marital property. If she earns less, his income is still marital property.", "Hence, a divorce. If he is not being allowed a fair shake in how marital property is going to be spent then he needs to move on.", "No. Someone suggested he remove money from the joint accounts so she couldn't repair the car; withholding marital funds like that is a reason for her to divorce him.\n\nKeeping a family car and using joint funds to repair it is normal."]}
