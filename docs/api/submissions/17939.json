This wasn't Mia's party and she had no right to hijack it and lay down rules for people. You made Jenna a main dish and a side. Usually people with several food allergies/restrictions realize the menu will be fairly limited for them most of the time, so I don't think having two options for her is being thoughtless. If she wanted more options she (and Mia) could've brought their own dishes that fit Jenna's limitations. \n\nBut no, Mia had no right to try to turn this into a 'roots & berries' party on Jenna's behalf.", "NTA. I wouldn't invite Jenna or Mia to the next event. You did attempt to accommodate her but at the end of the day, you shouldn't have to adjust the entire event around someone else's restrictions. If it was a potluck, they easily could've brought more food for Jenna if it was a huge issue.", "NTA - she wants to have a Jenna friendly dinner, let her host it herself.", "NTA. Unless the allergy is bad enough that she can\u2019t be in the room with it, then you did everything you could to accommodate her. You made things she can eat and made what she can\u2019t clear. Mia is an ahole for trying to control your party, and she needs to step back.", "Mia needs to mind her own business. Jenna can speak for herself.\n\nNTA", "NTA - Mia is welcome to throw her own (and make all of the food for) Jenna-centric party if she wants an event where Jenna can eat everything. You were very thoughtful to make sure there are at least two main things Jenna can eat while also hosting others without such a restrictive diet.\n\nETA - has Jenna weighed in at all? I am a super picky eater, but I would be embarrassed if my wife asked the hosts of a party to cater any food at all for me. I realize allergies are completely different than pickiness, but as my own whole grown up person, I know how to navigate food for myself and wouldn't want my SO dictating other people's parties on my behalf.", "NTA\n\nI will be forever sick of people thinking everyone has to accommodate their every single allergy. If it's 1 or 2 things, okay, but 10+? I'm sorry but y'all gotta bring your own food.", "NTA, you provided some foods she could eat. You are not obligated to ensure all foods are acceptable for her.", "NTA I have coeliac disease and don't eat red meat. I don't expect everyone to bow down to me.\n\nHeck I'm just happy if people have even thought about me (this could be just chips and dips) The fact you did one main and side that she could eat was very generous. \n\nWhat did Jenna think? Did she expect every meal to cater to her needs? Or was she happy with what you made her? Because it seems that Mia is talking on Jenna's behalf without consulting her opinion.", "NTA. Mia crossed a line here. It isn\u2019t her event and she tried to hijack it.\n\nAlso: What\u2019s Jenna\u2019s take? If I were her, I\u2019d be appreciative of my partner\u2019s intentions but horribly, horribly embarrassed by her execution. I think if Jenna is feeling left out, that\u2019s understandable, but that\u2019s for her to handle. She can speak for herself if she wants to. (Maybe she doesn\u2019t even care as long as she\u2019s safe and has a couple of good options.)", "NTA since it seems Jenna's allergies aren't as severe as not to be able to be in the presence of the allergens, so your cooking with problematic ingredients didn't stop her from attending, plus you made sure there were dishes she could eat. \n\nMia is way out of line. If she wants an event where Jenna can eat absolutely everything served, she could host and cater such an event herself.", "I, for several years, was head cook for a 2-week camping event for MY group of about 10 people at a 10K event. One year, a person joined my camp with a \"death list\" of things she could not eat. I made sure that, for every meal, there was something she could eat. That included my Lamb Night (3 legs of lamb on the grill, my famous eggplant dish, potatoes, salad and appetizers). This meal served 40-50 people. She got a lamb chop, plain potato, and grilled eggplant slices. She was SO grateful that she could participate in my huge dinner.\n\nThe thing I am trying to say: You included her by having something she could eat. Your dinner cannot restrict what everybody else eats based on 1 persons dietary restrictions.\n\nNTA!!!", "NTA\n\nI wonder what Mia's reaction would be if there was someone else attending the party who had allergies that conflicted with Jenna's--which could easily happen. And then a guest who only eats paleo. And another one who is keto. \n\nNo host would be able to make every dish suitable for all those guests. Striving to have a main, a side and a salad or dessert that each guest can eat is an undertaking these days.", "NTA - But Mia sure is!  Asking to bring a dish, or several, when your partner has that many allergies was perfectly fine, but when she suggested turning it into a potluck...that crossed the line.  It was your event, not hers.  Then she played jump rope with the line by trying to insist absolutely everything be within Jenna's very strict dietary requirements.  Not only was that rude to do to _your_ party, but it was rude to all the guests that might not want to spend an evening with food that they don't like and don't want to eat just to accommodate one person.\n\nOften people with that long a list of dietary restrictions just don't get invited to any event with food, or if they do they are requested to bring their own meal to ensure every single requirement has been followed.  Very few people will take on the challenge of even making one dish that doesn't contain a \"wrong\" ingredient, especially if the allergies are serious.  One mistake and your friend could become ill, after all.  So Mia and Jenna should have been grateful that you made sure there were at least two safe dishes out of your own time and money.\n\nI think you should talk to Jenna to see if she felt Mia was behaving appropriately or if Mia went overboard all on her own.  The answer would determine whether or not they get invited to another event.  After all, you don't deserve being glared at all night in your own home when you already did more than most people would to be accommodating.", "NTA - you made 2 dishes that she could eat and she was welcome to bring more of her own. Absolutely ridiculous to expect anything more than that.", "Nta.\n\n\nI have problems with food and usually my Friends make something i can eat. Usually i end the dinner with the stomach full so no problem. If the quantity was enough to be satisfied, NTA, if you didn't prepared enough food for an adult...yta.", "NTA-unless Jenna has a life threatening allergy, you went out of your way (without being asked by the person with the actual food issues) to ensure she had two things to eat. Mia needs to stay in her lane.", "NTA. You were accommodating to her in one dish and one side, like you said. Because there are so many allergies, it's extremely difficult to make any dishes without those things. If Mia brings this up again, just tell her next time SHE can organize a dinner and then SHE can make the rules on what to bring. Since this was YOUR dinner, YOU make the rules on what to bring.", "NTA. Honestly, with that many allergies, she might consider bringing her own meal and just enjoying the company. Better safe than sorry because people who don't cook for those allergies can miss something pretty easily without even trying to be careless or exclusive. And their girlfriends shouldn't be hijacking other people's events to gatekeep for them.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t running a restaurant. You tried to accommodate in a very reasonable way. If Mia and Jenna don\u2019t like it, they\u2019re welcome to go elsewhere.", "Nta.  You did accommodate.  I'm sure Jenna is used to working around her allergies", ">\tMia said that a good friend would care more about ensuring that everyone had equal access at the dinner,\n\nThe only way to ensure equal access is for nobody to eat lol. NTA", "NTA\n\nI agree with Mia and a dinner for Jenna would be nice.  Mia should get right on that.", "NTA. Host another one and don't invite Mia.", "You can't let one person's dietary needs constitute what is made.  It was very kind of you to make specific things she could eat.  Next time do NOT invite Mia, let her know guilt trips do not work and she is the disrespectful one.  NTA", "NTA. Mia doesn't get to dictate the conditions of someone else's party. If Mia wants to have a party at which everyone must accommodate Jenna's needs, that's on Mia.\n\nYou went out of your way to make a reasonable accommodation for Jenna - very considerate and well done.", "NTA- because the effected person has not said anything about this.  There were foods she could eat, and if she did not sign up to bring a dish herself, then thats on her too. Long as everything was labels so she knew .", "Mia sounds like a real stuck-up #unt. \n\nYou made dishes that Jenna could eat. \n\nWhat did Jenna have to say about this?   Was she mad?  \n\nNta.", "NTA.  There were things there she could eat so you did accommodate her.  I have allergies myself but I would never say \"you can't serve a single dish that I can't eat\" which is basically what her girlfriend was saying.", "If Mia would like a party tailored to Jenna's many food restrictions, SHE should host said party. NTA.", "NTA-Mia was asking way too much. Not everything revolves around what she wants.", " NTA and Mia needs to grow up. If she wants a party with all Jenna friendly food, why doesn\u2019t she host one?", "NTA.  As a person in a similar if not worse situation than Jenna I would have felt very included if there was anything I could eat.   I can understand Mia\u2019s intention, but it wasn\u2019t her party and she took it way to far.  Besides, Jenna is probably used to having limited options anyway and hopefully has found peace with her situation.   Mia obviously isn\u2019t used to it yet and as a person with a non restrictive diet it probably just seems like it sucks and isn\u2019t fair (which is true) and she\u2019s trying to help, but she\u2019s just going about it in all the wrong ways and lashing out.  Hopefully she\u2019ll learn.", "NTA, and I guarantee you Jenna doesn't care. This is Mia being the superhero no one asked for. People with diet restrictions are used to eating plain bread and soda at dinners like this. It's nothing new and they don't get offended. The fact that there was a dish and side for her delighted her, I guarantee you.", "Here's a crazy idea.. why didn't Jenna bring something Jenna could eat? Nta", "NTA, I have a plethora of food allergies and it's nobody's issue but mine. I always make sure I bring . I would be so excited if I even had a single dish to eat!", "I think her list of allergies is very interesting. I\u2019ve never seen that selection of allergies together and I see a lot of them in my job. I\u2019d almost wonder if they are flavor preferences versus all real allergies. I can\u2019t think of a restaurant dish that could accommodate it with no modification.", "ESH.  Mia had no right to take over, but she\u2019s not wrong.  Having stuff Jenna could safely eat was nice, but it\u2019d be nicer if she didn\u2019t have to spend the evening worry about ending up in the ER because someone put a spoon back in the wrong bowl.", "i would say NTA but honestly, it could've been handled a bit better. you're saying Mia said others should do this so that her gf would finally be able to enjoy everything there and that usually she cant do so. since there was no objection they were probably looking forward to this. and then they show up and only one or two dishes are available.\n\nit would've been much better for you to send her a private message in advance letting her know that's not going to happen.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was extremely rude for her to hijack yours and demand all the dishes accommodate Jenna\u2019s maaany food allergies.", "NTA.  If it's that restrictive, you bring your own food or don't go.", "This. I have just as many restrictions. I just bring my own food to most parties and if someone makes a single side I can eat, I'm very, very grateful.", "This. Mia should throw her own party if that's how she wants it to go.", "Yup, I\u2019m a vegetarian and where ever I go I can always find something to eat. It\u2019s not that bad, I don\u2019t expect everyone to cater me. I feel bad for when people do.", "NTA. Everyone had access to multiple dishes they could eat. Mission accomplished. I hope you were able to enjoy your own party!", "Is Jenna 3 years old?  NTA, but Mia is.  Next time, don't invite them.", "NTA \n\nyou accommodated Jenna with a main dish and side but forcing everyone to adhere to her dietary restriction is bad taste unless the allergies are so bad she can\u00b4t even be i a room with people who eat problematic ingredients.", "True. I'm currently breastfeeding an infant who will poop blood if I eat dairy or soy. My family made a Christmas spread where I couldn't eat anything but the veggies and hummus I brought, and I didn't think much of it until a month later when they wanted to plan a potluck. When I brought up the allergy issues, they said \"maybe\" they will make something I can eat. Wtf? Potlucks are about sharing. Instead, they'd have me bring something to share with everyone, while none of them will make something that can be shared with me? So I opted out of the potluck. OP made a main and side that Jenna could have. That's plenty accommodating.", "I also had similar restrictions. It would never occur to me to trust someone else's cooking. I'd let the host know ahead of time my food restrictions and say I'd bring my own food, so they know not to cook for me, and won't feel like I'm insulting their food by bringing my own. But even if someone offered to cook for me, I'd probably insist on bringing my own so I know it's safe.", "Honestly I've given up between allergies and dietary restrictions. I love cooking for people and usually when I go over to friends for parties I'll make some small side dish or dessert snack food for everyone to enjoy. But between one friend being vegan, 2 being lactose intolerant, another refusing to eat any green veggies, another with soy and gluten allergy, another being allergic to shellfish, and another that finds black pepper too spicy, I usually just pick up a cartoon of bakery cookies from the grocery store these days and let whoever can enjoy them have them.", "Lol! To be fair though, the one with the shellfish allergy could literally die.", "Oh I've always gone out of my way to make sure those with allergies don't get exposed to anything, it's just the list of viable dishes that please everyone and is easy to make has gotten vanishingly small.", "NTA. My diet is at least that restrictive and I either bring my own food or don't eat. I would have been thrilled that you had 2 things that were safe for me. And Mia had zero right to try to hijack your party. She can host her own with her own rules.", "NTA. And she wasn\u2019t forgotten because you made her a dish and a side dish..", "INFO - what does Jenna think of this and the attention? May be worth asking for a list of a few main/side dishes that are safe so she doesn't always end up with the same options every event. \n\nStill not Mia's place to dictate the changes - she can throw her own event. I hope her contribution was free from allergins", "I will gladly adjust everything to suit restrictions instead of just some, but that is MY decision to make.", "NTA, notice how it wasn't even Jenna that made the request,  she was proudly just happy she could eat something. Mia can kick rocks", "Right? The list.of what my partner will eat is longer than what he won't, and while I'll always make sure there's something he'll eat, it's unreasonable to expect everything to be catered to him.", "That's really inconsiderate of your family, particularly when you have a small baby. You made the right choice to opt out.", "NTA. If she had one specific allergy, like peanuts, I'd understand her because making food without peanuts is rather easy. However, she's allergic to so many things, and you did make some food that she could eat.", "NTA\n\nIt is not your responsibility to manage the allergies of another person, it's their own.\n\nIn one way, I'm getting the impression that Jenna isn't making nearly as big of a deal over what happened as Mia is portraying it to be. The annoyance is more Mia expecting *you* to take the place of *her* to cater to Jenna.", "NTA. From the list of foods you gave that Jenna can\u2019t eat, are you sure it\u2019s actual allergies? Because I have a very similar list of foods I can\u2019t eat if I want to enjoy the following days out of the bathroom. \n\nIt\u2019s called the low FODMAP diet, and you do it to find out what foods containing FODMAP s you have a reaction to. Usually used by people with IBS or SIBO. Go look them up. They\u2019re both acronyms. It\u2019s all about fermenting small chain carbohydrates. \n\nI know, as someone with a stupidly restrictive diet, that I need to bring my own damn meal when eating at a friends house or family members house. I can make a restaurant work by explaining the big issue foods to a waiter, but for someone house? I bring my own.", "I have one (1) very severe food allergy to something utterly bizarre (grapes) but at the point where it's 10+ allergies I Just gotta wonder how someone even lives in society? People live. They eat. They microwave stuff in the break room that smell bad. Does she live in a plastic hamster ball? \n\n\nI especially don't understand the sheer entitlement of it.", "This is what I usually do. My restrictions my problem.\n\nAnd I am already pleasantly suprised if someone goes through the added effort to include me. And OP did just that for a main AND a side? **NTA** not by a mile.", "I agree with you. \n\nAnymore it's certain people being picky and sticking an \"allergy\" label on it. There is a distinct difference between an allergy and an intolerance. People with either **know** what gives them a reaction, plus what else those foods are ingredients in, thus avoid those altogether. I don't have an issue with a person disliking different kinds of foods until it becomes \"Well, I'm allergic to 'x', 'y', etc.\" and the list grows.\n\nIf I'm having a party and someone tells me a guest has an allergy or intolerance to [these things], I'm going to communicate that said person needs to bring their EpiPen and invite them to bring anything that they *can* eat. Obviously EpiPens aren't used for intolerance, but you get the picture. \n\nIn OP's cases, others should not get angry at the host who attempts to accommodate a guest or puts it out there for the guest to bring food of their own. That's when I'm questioning whether this is more pickiness than medical.", "Sorry, I had to laugh at the part about \"finds black pepper too spicy\". I'm not against people who dislike a food item,  but when it sounds ridiculous, it's more of that person being picky. Shellfish and nuts I don't question, although it is the reasonable expectation that someone with these allergies has an EpiPen on them at all times.\n\nOne of my friends sticks an \"allergy\" label on dairy, yet eats all of these dairy bi-products. From get togethers where he won't bring his own food to restaurants where he's wasting plates of food, I don't even have the allergy, yet I know more about what he \"can't\" have than he does. By the way, he doesn't carry an EpiPen.\n\nA few months ago I flipped out on him when we were at a restaurant. He ordered nachos for the table while I was in the bathroom. I was surprised when the plate arrived, but he was *more* surprised that there was cheese on the nachos. I asked him if he read the menu and if the description listed no cheese. He said no, then got pissy because he wanted to eat them but was \"allergic!\"\n\nI very pointedly asked him if he knew the difference between an allergy and an intolerance. He just sat there quiet and I gave him the short version of what distinguishes the two. In so many words, I told him that he needs to decide which one it is because it's means the difference between a trip to the bathroom or to the hospital. And from what I've seen, it's neither, so cut this out already."]}
