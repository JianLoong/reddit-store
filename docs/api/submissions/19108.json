He's a grown man and should know better.

Not because I'm particularly nice, but that way he might hold off on contacting parents and would wind up staying another day in there.", "If it was going to take 5 minutes he can put his stupid shoes on the ground, get his hungover ass in gear and WALK. You had work, not a brunch date. NTA", "NTA.  No.  Your brother's crappy decisions shouldn't cause you to get in trouble at work.  So him not hearing a lecture from your parents apparently is more important than your job.  Your family kind of stinks except dad.", "The dumbass didn't even bother to wait until later than 6am", "NTA. He didn\u2019t care about the consequences until he realized his parents were gonna be pissed.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA and likely the reason behind your refusal to pick him up is this is a pattern of behaviors that has been escalating and so you\u2019re proverbially \u201cwashing your hands\u201d of the matter. \n\nThat said, this \u201clearning moment\u201d of being arrested is only a learning moment from a sober persons perspective. If your brother is an alcoholic, he *will not* learn from this. I was a half to full bottle of whiskey a day alcoholic for almost 8 months. I was luckily not inclined to drive drunk, but not a single consequence in my life made me quit. It wasn\u2019t a loving intervention from friends and family that finally woke me up, it was realizing every single one of them was cutting me off one by one and one of my last 2 friends let me know this pretty brutally.\n\nSometimes love does hurt, but know that love isn\u2019t abuse OR abandonment. You have no obligation to cover for your brother and accept his behavior, nor should you subject yourself to it in some noble sacrifice, but I also urge you (if you ever want to have a relationship with your brother, which is entirely up to you) to not to walk away leaving things unsaid.  Let your brother know that a restorative option exist if he can sober up and admit he\u2019s got a problem, else he\u2019ll wind up alone.\n\nAgain, that\u2019s only if you want a relationship with him. It\u2019s entirely up to you and there\u2019s no wrong answer/opinion here for what you can want from this situation.", "P L E A S E consider showing this post (the comments) to your brother and mother. They need a fucking reality check. The amount of blame shifting and lack of accountability is disgusting.\n\nThe level of mental gymnastics they\u2019re doing to make you out to be a bad guy (girl) in this situation is beyond Olympic level.", "NTA \n\nSupporting family is important, but it wasn't a dire emergency.

Your brother is lucky he didn't kill somebody, and should be glad your parents even picked him up. Your mom is just protecting his feelings, but ignoring the headline.

And your parents are trying to enable that?\n\nSeriously, think about it. He KNEW he was wrong. Your parents know he was wrong. But you were expected to be late to your job, which could result in your termination. Your termination would mean no money. No money and no job runs the very real risk of homelessness.

Maybe he needed someone to sort out bail or something so a Lyft might not work, but if he's 27 and has no friends he can call on in this situation, that's on him.", "And it sounds like the 23 year old is way more responsible than him.", "So if she doesn't have a problem with \"calling him out\" when he's in the wrong but she's now mad at you instead, this is your mom saying she supports drunk driving? I'd ask her how long that's been true and if that's where your brother learned it from.", "Yes, this, and thank you.\n\nOP's brother should be ashamed of himself, and he does not deserve to have OP - or frankly anyone else in his family - speak to him until he starts acting like a responsible adult.", "There's no way this is true", "OP's house to PS to Bro house - 5 minutes? Rerally? Sounds well within walking distance.", "Yeah no way it would have been 5 minutes. I assume he needed to be bailed out too? It took 8 hours for my bail to be processed and I was released. I\u2019m not aware of being able to bail yourself out of jail but maybe that\u2019s a thing?", "He called your parents at 6AM.  That sounds like he needed to get out in time for HIM to go to work, while telling you that your work is less important than HIM.  Let him continue not talking to you.  NTA", "He needs to get used to walking. Drunk drivers generally get their driving privileges pulled for a while, usually a year. He should ride a bicycle like the other DUI drivers do. If he doesn\u2019t own a bike, he should walk to Goodwill and see what they have.", "They didn't his good ol chevorlegs.", "Sure, if OP has the free time, why not. But why should OP be late and risk his own job for this brother? And yes, somebody who drives drunk and imperils other people's lives is a deadbeat. What terminology would you prefer? Is \"prospective murderer\" somehow better?", "Who said this wasn't one of those jobs you just described?", "Drunk driving is not a 'mistake'.", "I never said drink driving was cool? Not my opinion at allll. But we all make mistakes and I know my siblings would be there for me if I made a mistake", "Never said that, I condone supporting family. Take out the drunk driving from this situation and see if you'll say YTA", "We already know Brother somehow has no access to cabs or Uber.", "MY CAR! MY CHOICE! LOOK THE FUCK OUT BRO BECAUSE IM ON ONE!", "I'm a farm kid that was able to legally drive drunk. (On private roads on our farm land) no traffic no cops nobody to hurt but ourselves. A few times we'd get too drunk and just have a fire and cook some supper and sleep in the trucks. No reason to get on public roads with some drinks in your gullet.", "If they are, it might explain the arrested development of a 27 year old who drives drunk and calls sis to bail him out.", "I don\u2019t know, given mom\u2019s reaction it sounds like they are paying for poor parenting in other ways.", "If they can sell his car, that means they own his car. At 27, he needs to be more independent than needing to drive his mom\u2019s car to a bar to get drunk.", "There\u2019s ZERO way it was \u201conly 5 minutes\u201d and I\u2019m glad OP wasn\u2019t manipulated into doing it", "Yea, at least in my case, my parents assumed they were teaching me a lesson by letting me sit in the town jail for a night but instead I spent a whopping 4 hours in prison but before entering prison you get to have a fun time taking a public shower and spreading your ass cheeks , I'm not saying op is an ah, it's just shitty to leave people to like sweat it out in jail for a few hours just to prove a point", "Exactly. My mom was hit by a drunk driver when she was 19. He completely shattered her knees and legs. She was in a wheelchair fir 8 years and she had to relearn how to walk. Had something like a dozen surgeries to fix them. As a kid, my mom could never run to play with me and she needed a cane until she died.  I despise people like OPs brother", "He had money the night before for drinking. He should have kept some.", "Honestly, I would've done the same thing. Drunk drivers are something that I just think are abhorrent. There are so many options besides getting behind the wheel. There's no excuse. I also don't think it would've taken just five minutes to get him out. Everything that happened is his own fault, not yours.", "Also would have saved him the trouble of a DUI and risking killing people if he had just walked. Well it sounds like he\u2019ll be doing a lot of that now!", "or his own damn feet. My partners tenant walked 10km back home when he got a DUI last month.", "Even if they asked you to keep a crime away from your parents?", "I have a friend who's brain damaged due to a drunk driver. You're willing to be  complicit in attempted murder.", "He didn't need help. He needed a ride so mommy and daddy wouldn't find out about the stupid and insanely dangerous thing he did and be cross.", "The brother put himself in front of others when he decided to drive drunk. He\u2019s lucky he didn\u2019t kills someone. He didn\u2019t deserve any help.", "I see what you're saying. Yes it's a choice. But drunk people don't always make good choices. Because drunk people are impaired. Is that not fact?", "If you're judging a situation, you have to judge all components. In THIS situation, which you are passing judgement on, drunk driving IS a component.", "There\u2019s literally never an excuse to drive drunk", "It would also go well together with their mother's reaction...the brother is probably mommy's golden child.", "And is an entitled asshole about it. Like he was pissed she had the audacity to say no. Clearly HER fault he got in trouble.", "Pun intended? Lol", "And if the parents of a grown ass man take his car and sell it, he'd be well within his rights to call the cops on them for stealing his car, lol", "When that point is \"you could kill someone\", I think it warrants learning a lesson. If we were talking about something like driving with expired registration, sure that's extreme. \n\nI hate that people minimize drunk driving because something didn't happen this time. It's literally risking the lives of everyone you encounter on the road, so you don't have to be inconvenienced by taking an Uber or a cab.", "It might have been overkill in your case (and I agree that it was), but frankly I think someone with a DUI could use the wake-up call.", "I am so sorry that you and your family had to endure that - especially since it was such an avoidable and selfish thing for the drunk to do.\n\nThe only two ambulance rides I've had in my life were because I was in a car that was hit by a drunk driver. Twice. \n\nOne time was just a concussion and soreness, but the other involved severe fractures and extensive physical therapy, and I still don't have the strength and range of motion in one ankle that I should have", "People like OP's brother you mean?", "*Op's brother*", "you mean OP's brother right?", "No, he was an asshole the moment he got behind the wheel drunk.", "I got drunk, did something truly beyond stupid, and you made me accept responsibility for my actions.  As a result of my own stupidity, I am now not going to talk to you because I had to spend time behind bars for breaking the law and endangering the lives of everyone else who happened to be driving at that time.\n\nSounds like someone is pouting and feeling sorry for themselves.", "He could have called a bail bondsman. Their numbers are at the station- according to my son. Your brother needs this come to Jesus moment. You mom's attitude is probably the reason he's taken so long to get here.", "Yes, drunk drivers are always the asshole. Have a DD or don't drink when you go out.", ".07 and failing to stop at a stop sign is a deserved DUI\n\n\nFirst time drinkers drunk driving deserve a DUI\n\n\nIf you are still drunk the next morning, speeding and get pulled over, you deserve a DUI\n\nI am not sure what point you were trying to make. Non-alcoholics drunk driving are assholes. Alcoholic drunk drivers are assholes. Its not so much a pat on the back as obvious. Drunk driving kills people.", "I'm sorry for your friend. But saying they're willing to be complicit is going too far.", "He could have accidentally crashed into a dam and flooded the entire town for all I care. If he\u2019s your brother, and you love him, you go", "Oh and I take it you\u2019ve never made any mistakes?", "So maybe...don't get drunk? Or if you must, at least have a plan for transportation?", "So you'd be ok with it and not blame a drunk driver who, hypothetically, mowed down one of your loved ones? Hey, drunk people make bad decisions, right?", "When you plan to get drunk, it's your responsibility to make sure that you won't do anything stupid later.", "Yeah I know. You could always sleep it off with a nice fire and some hot dogs in the cooler. Like I said.", "Dad's reaction too \"don't worry we would have found out eventually\" dad is used to having to defend his daughter from his wife and son.", "OMG.\nFrom a legal standpoint, sure.\n\nThis hypothetical is a measure of disapproval and anger, and obviously A HYPOTHETICAL. Because you can't sell a car that isn't yours. People do ask for things like the title....\n\nBut FFS, you can be unequivocal in your disapproval of a family member that makes choices THIS dangerous and shitty. Can, and morally, should.", "IDK, he did go crying to Mommy and Daddy to get him out of this mess (after asking his little sister of course) so he's the one who got them involved. \n\nBut I'm not even seeing in the post that they sold his car so like where did you get that?", "In order for his parents to sell the car, they would need a title to prove that they own it. If the title is in their name, it is their car, and they have every right to sell it. If the title is in his name, they would not be able to sell it anyway, so this would be moot.", "the only DUI charge i've ever had any sympathy for was my friend who lives in a rural area. Went out on a date, is a bit of a lightweight, had a couple drinks and then the guy started getting super creepy and shitty with her and she panicked and drove home instead of hanging out at his place like she'd been planning to. \n\nideally she'd have gotten away, then pulled over, turned off the car and called someone to get her, but she was freaked out and kept driving until she got pulled over in a DUI checkpoint. \n\nshe got a really minimal charge though.", "Welcome to the \"ambulance ride due to drunk driver hitting our car and causing a concussion\" club! \ud83e\udd73 \n\nI was 5, concussion, dislocated neck, and two black eyes. I have a permanent lump of tissue on my forehead where it happened.", "Yes sorry, I just woke up \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "In some places if you spend the night in jail the police remove the cash from your belongings and they issue you a check when you leave. Learned this the hard way for public intoxication. \nAlso, there\u2019s nothing more embarrassing then being hungover and waiting for your mom to pick you up from jail. Once was enough for me.", "Where I live, bail bondsmen are illegal.", "Agreed, I meant, it would have taken OP more than \u201cfive minutes\u201d to pick him up/ get him released from jail.  You expressed better the potential time.  If she stopped, she most likely would have been VERY late for work, jeopardizing her job, inconveniencing her coworkers, and just because big brother wanted to hide it from his parents.", "I never said they weren't. Good job ignoring that the poster is an asshole, the brother is an asshole & that calling DUIs assholes isn't taking a stand against drunk driving, preventing it with ID scans and breathalyzers would actually being doing something to stop it", "You are using strawman arguments to distract from your ridiculous statement that all people who got DUI a have drinking problems and have done it before \n\nI never made the argument DUIs aren't deserved in those cases, it's showing who ridiculous your blanket statements was.\n\nI also never said drunk driving isn't an asshole behavior, I pointed out if countries cared about preventing it they'd install breathalyzers in every car asking other measures.\nAlcohol impairs judgement & yet the solution everyone has is \"don't pick up drunk drivers from jail,\" instead of let's make it so they can't drive their car.", "If you love him you should protect him from himself. Not help him avoid the consequences of his actions.\n\nBesides, you put it like OP allowed him to go through torture or something. He's  a 27yo man, if he can't handle *his parents being mad at him*, that's completely his problem", "Yeah no this a bit bigger than a normal mistake though. Drunk driving is unforgivable because not only are you making the conscious decision to put yourself at risk but also innocent people who had nothing to do with your stupid decisions.", "Hey, great plan! One most people make. And when it doesn't go to plan and the rides no longer available, sometimes a dumbass reckons \"shit, I'm all good, I can make it\" and that's the bravado that alcohol causes talking. It's a terrible decision and he's lucky he didn't kill anyone, but that's not a decision a sober person makes. He made a shitty choice, he's not a shitty person.", "Right. I\u2019m agreeing with you although can\u2019t do that most places. Yeah driving drunk on private property where only you are in danger I think is fine.", "I thought this too. Mom babies the son and has deemed him the golden child. Helping/saving him from the consequences of his horrible choices are more important than her employment. Fricken crazy talk right there. She should risk her livelihood always because her brother should always come first and be a priority.", "I don't disagree with that, but that still doesn't mean it's okay to take someone's car from them", "I mean, who wouldn't call their parents to go get them from the police station, if they didn't have anyone else to call? Even if they did, I still don't see anything wrong with calling your parents for a pick up like that. \n\nAnd they didn't, I'm just responding to the one person up above who said if they did that, their parents would sell their car.", "While I agree with you, that doesn't mean people have free reign to steal a car as long as it's from someone who drink and drove in it.", "That seems pretty smart to me.  The check keeps the alcoholics from just racing to the next bar as soon as they get out.  \n\nNo money in wallet = they go home and stay sober at least for a few hours", "That\u2019s ok. When your mother brings up family being more important than work just remind her of all the families your brother could have destroyed with his stupid, reckless behavior; your family included.", "Because your parents have to hide the booze from him?", "Hopefully it\u2019s the last family dinner if they throw you under the bus for not picking up your degenerate brother. Dude could have killed someone innocent with his terrible judgment and in no way should you be required to do anything for him after that.", "My cousins were ages 3 and 5, killed by a drunk driver. He's lucky he was arrested instead of wheeled away on a stretcher or worse, a hearse. \n\nAnd worse than that, he hasn't even learned his mistake. That's frustrating. \n\nNTA", "Only awkward if you care, I'm telling you not to care, you're not an emotional punching bag for his problems he caused", "Tell her that Speech is silver, silence is golden and that you are glad that she doesn't talk to you\n\nNTA", "I don't know. I'm not American, but I would assume that if a city doesn't have any of these options, it's small enough for a person to walk. He also didn't have to wake up anyone at 6 AM, he could have just waited. I really don't understand how a 27 year old can't figure something out by himself.", "Except no one said \"all people who got DUI a have drinking problems and have done it before\" at all- you're putting words in their mouth. \n\nThe first person said that at minimum a DUI is a SIGN of a possible drinking problem or alcoholism, not that someone getting a DUI is 100% proof that that person must have a drinking problem. And the person you just responded to simply said anyone who drives drunk and gets a DUI deserves it. Not sure where you're getting this \"absolutely anyone who's gotten a DUI is an alcoholic\" argument from because no one has said that.", "Yes, though this isn\u2019t some random person. It\u2019s OPs brother. Do you just not love them anymore? By the virtue of their begging they clearly realized they did wrong. Additionally, the justice system will hash them out an appropriate punishment.", "People shouldn't always be protected from the shitty choices they make. Especially when they put innocent lives in danger", "You also have to consider the consequences to any first responder who has to scrape you off the dirt road, though. Just \u2026 don\u2019t drive drunk. Anywhere. Any vehicle (this includes scooters, motorcycles, dirt bikes, ATVs, and if you\u2019re drunk enough, don\u2019t even try a bicycle).", "That\u2019s how it is in some cultures. I worked in China for over a decade and knew *a lot* of young Chinese women who were essentially subsidizing their brother\u2019s lifestyles at whatever age.", "They can only sell it if they own it, though. They need to have their names on the title, and not his.", "Not sure where OP lives but there are absolutely places where you can bail yourself out. If the brother didn't have the funds and needed his parents to pay his bail, that's just one more layer of him being selfish and irresponsible. Nothing wrong with asking your parents for help in times of need, but expecting them to bail him out without having to face any repercussions at all is just entitled behavior and would potentially enable him to get into trouble again. \n\nAnd the only way the parents could sell the car is if their name is on the title, making it actually *their* car and not the brother's, and fully within their rights to sell.", "Also percents them from taking a bus home so idk", "Most of the guy getting out needed cash for taxis, no Ubers at the time. So you\u2019d have to get a taxi to take you to a check cashing place and lose 10% in fees to get home.  Those were the directions given if you couldn\u2019t get someone to pick you up.\n\nEdit:  Also when you\u2019re arrested for a PI they don\u2019t let you out until your sober.  Minimum 4 hour stay.", "He also wasn't concerned about OP being late for work.  Sounds like he doesn't really care if his actions have consequences for others.", "After my own experiences with this, I will never judge someone for being arrested (or even charged) with a DUI. I was stopped for having my headlights off when I was driving them all home extremely drunk (in one of their vehicles, which I thought had automatic headlights and the roads were very well lit.) I was 100% sober, had only had 4 drinks over a 5 hour time span and know my limits. The second a cop stops you, they\u2019ve already decided if they\u2019re going to arrest you or not. In court, it is 100% a guilty until proven innocent game. I\u2019m taking my punishment on the chin, and using my experience to hopefully save others from my fate. Do NOT offer any information to the police. Sobriety tests are OPTIONAL. I refused to blow into the breathalyzer, which is apparently \u201cevidence of a guilty conscience\u201d so if you\u2019re more than 75% sure you won\u2019t be over your legal limit, blow into that shit. The system is designed to get convictions, not be accurate.", "How does him being her brother change anything you can love someone and choose not to indulge in their bad behavior. He wasn\u2019t going to rot there forever he just would\u2019ve gotten out a little bit earlier with her help and even then it wasn\u2019t necessary it was just his preference because he didn\u2019t want to face the music and tell his parents who were obviously willing to pick him up with minor inconvenience to them btw because he didn\u2019t them to find out he got a DUI.", "I agree with you, there needs to be repercussions. In this situation it sounds like the punishment has already been laid out. Does it need to be for life? \nPicking one of my siblings up wouldn't be about rewarding their behaviour, it would be reinforcing our relationship. \nThere's multiple joke memes about best friends burying a body together or waking up in a cell together. Why is picking a sibling up different?", "Definitely. Those farmroads are bumpy as fuck and can be dangerous at night time, and theres absolutely no way a first responder would be able to navigate those tiny roads that split off into different fields.. Lots of people I know hurt themselves on quads and dirtbikes because they were having some drinks and decided to racing or do a big jump when they got the liquid courage.", "That\u2019s fair too. But I\u2019m more understanding if someone does something stupid and dangerous that can hurt themselves than if they do something stupid and dangerous that could hurt them and others.", "Because that\u2019s a joke and no innocent persons life has actually been put in danger in the process. Her brother consciously chose to innocent people in danger.", "Now imagine that your sibling is the one mangled by a drunk driver. And instead of picking him up from the drunk tank, you're at the ICU trying not to cry or look horrified in front of him.\n\nWould you be so kindly disposed toward the drunk driver and his little oopsie then?"]}
