I would argue that your job is more important than picking up your drunk brother from the police station. He's an adult and those were consequences of his actions.", "NTAH\n\nYour brother got himself into that situation, he's an adult, and can figure it out for himself. \n\nIf you're willing to make a poor decision (drinking and driving) then you can deal with the consequences of said decision. \n\nI commend you for not bailing him out!", "NTA.   He's a grown man and his actions have consequences, it's not your responsibility to hide his bad actions.", "NTA. Your brother made his bed, let him lay in it. He endangered the lives of everyone around him by driving drunk. And all he is worried about is his parents finding out? Nice guy. \n\nYour brother is 27 years old. He is old enough to start taking responsibility for his old actions, and that includes the walk of shame in front of his parents. Let him be mad at you. And what your mother is doing is enabling his behavior.", "I love flipping these around. \u201cI was caught driving drunk and my sister wouldn\u2019t skip work to bail me out so now I\u2019m not speaking to her.

Let him not speak to you. Once he gets through the legal side of things it'll cost some cash. You wouldn't want him hitting you up for a \"loan\" that you'll never see again.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not your responsibility to go pick him up like he\u2019s a child. He\u2019s an adult so he should be responsible for himself. He\u2019s the one who messed up so you should be the one upset and not him. He\u2019s the one who ended up at the police station, so HE should be apologetic and reflecting on himself. Don\u2019t listen to what your parents and brother said. You had to go to work, so why should you drop everything just to pick him up. Maybe letting him sit at the station for longer will make him think about how and why he got there.", "NTA - If your 27yo brother can't even face up to his parents and take responsibility for his actions, that's a 'him' problem.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Mom is an enabler so she agrees with him. Expect more of this behavior until it is addressed by your brother. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. Your brother is lucky he didn't kill someone.", "NTA. The guy\u2019s 27. Why does he need his parents (or you) to pick him up?", "NTA and don't you dare apologize for not covering for him.  Your dad is right, and he has your back.", "Nta. He did the crime. He can do the time until mommy picks him up.", "I don't know how the relationship between you siblings is, however, I would pick up my brother from the police station even if I was going to be late for work. From where I see it, YTA", "NTA. Your brother was asking you to cover him up for getting a DUI not to picking up, he was trying to make you complicit if his fuck up.", "NTA. None of this is your fault.", "NTA it would have put you late to work and you did not cause the problem, also he was in an unpleasant situation but not unsafe, it doesn\u00b4t kill him to wait longer.\n\nAlso because there is probably paperwork etc that has to be done to release him, you might even have been the one that has to sign to promise that he will show up to his court date, if he is not out on bond. That is not your responsibility", "NTA. Drunk driving isn't a mistake, it's a conscious decision that can hurt or kill innocent people. \n\n>He answered that I could still take 5 minutes for my brother. \n\nIf it was only 5 minutes out of the way, he could've walked home in 15 minutes. \n\n>I still should of had picked him up because family is family and more important than work \n\nNo, responsible decisions are more important than fixing an idiot mistake\n\n>My dad, him, told me to not feel guilty about anything and that they would\u2019ve found out eventually \n\nYeah, and it would've been \"oh, that was months ago and nothing came of it. No need to get mad now.\"\n\nYou made the right decision. It isn't your fault that he can't handle the consequences of his mistake.", "NTA.    I left my SIL in jail for drunk driving.\nI have no sympathy for drunk drivers.", "NTA\n\nHe got in is car while drunk, got arrested, and he thinks that YOU should apologise for not dropping everything to shield him from his consequenses? No. He chose do drive, he needs to face the consequenses.\n\nDo not apologize. He is not your responsibility. His actions are not your responsibility.", "I have zero sympathy for drunk drivers who are endangering themselves or others from making a preventable and stupid choice. I would have made him wait a day at least if not the weekend. Definitely not risk losing my job for being late. Five minutes? Things are never five minutes and was he expecting to drop you off at work and he drive your car home or have you be way late and take him home then go to work?", "My brother could rot in jail, for all I care. I would laugh in the car all the way to work. But I\u2019m petty that way.\n\nYour brother can call one of his friends to come pick him up.\n\nYou sound like you have a better relationship with your brother, but your brother had alternative transportation options -besides you. NTA", "NTA.  He screwed up, he needs to own his mistake.", "NTA, 5 minutes is *never* 5 minutes, it would have put you late for work, and was in no way your fault. Your dad is right, he couldn't hide it for ever, and asking you in the first place puts you in the position of trying to help him hide it. He was an AH to call you in the first place.", "NTA. Your dad was the only one who was realistic about the whole thing", "NTA, clearly your brother is in the wrong here.\n\nBlaming others for the troubles they get themselves into because of their mistakes is messed up and you not blindly going to help your brother will hopefully make him realise what he did was wrong, and not to drink and drive again.", "I don\u2019t think there is a clear right or wrong here. Your relationship with your brother is different than my relationship with mine. Also, drunk driving isn\u2019t a crime I\u2019d like to condone or enable. \n\nWith that said, NTA.. but personally I would have picked my brother up, without hesitation.", "NTA. Actions have consequences, and your brother needed to face them.", "Not really, when he\u2019s in the wrong, she has no problem calling him out, I\u2019d say it\u2019s me she has an issue with lol", "I think they took his car", "They probably took him from his car if not impounded the car. He might have also needed bailed out.", "Im pretty sure he got his car taken away", "Hold your family accountable, yta not op lmao\n\nShe shouldn't have to be late and suffer the consequences just because her brother doesn't want to suffer his own. I love my family but in no way would I ever help a reckless driver and a drunk idiot", "I think the point is it shouldn't be your responsibility, and going to work was. Your brother did have other options, namely your parents, and if he didn't want to wake them up he could have been resourceful and found someone else."]}
