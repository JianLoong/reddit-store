He's a grown man and should know better.

Not because I'm particularly nice, but that way he might hold off on contacting parents and would wind up staying another day in there.", "If it was going to take 5 minutes he can put his stupid shoes on the ground, get his hungover ass in gear and WALK. You had work, not a brunch date. NTA", "NTA.  No.  Your brother's crappy decisions shouldn't cause you to get in trouble at work.  So him not hearing a lecture from your parents apparently is more important than your job.  Your family kind of stinks except dad.", "The dumbass didn't even bother to wait until later than 6am", "NTA. He didn\u2019t care about the consequences until he realized his parents were gonna be pissed.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA and likely the reason behind your refusal to pick him up is this is a pattern of behaviors that has been escalating and so you\u2019re proverbially \u201cwashing your hands\u201d of the matter. \n\nThat said, this \u201clearning moment\u201d of being arrested is only a learning moment from a sober persons perspective. If your brother is an alcoholic, he *will not* learn from this. I was a half to full bottle of whiskey a day alcoholic for almost 8 months. I was luckily not inclined to drive drunk, but not a single consequence in my life made me quit. It wasn\u2019t a loving intervention from friends and family that finally woke me up, it was realizing every single one of them was cutting me off one by one and one of my last 2 friends let me know this pretty brutally.\n\nSometimes love does hurt, but know that love isn\u2019t abuse OR abandonment. You have no obligation to cover for your brother and accept his behavior, nor should you subject yourself to it in some noble sacrifice, but I also urge you (if you ever want to have a relationship with your brother, which is entirely up to you) to not to walk away leaving things unsaid.  Let your brother know that a restorative option exist if he can sober up and admit he\u2019s got a problem, else he\u2019ll wind up alone.\n\nAgain, that\u2019s only if you want a relationship with him. It\u2019s entirely up to you and there\u2019s no wrong answer/opinion here for what you can want from this situation.", "P L E A S E consider showing this post (the comments) to your brother and mother. They need a fucking reality check. The amount of blame shifting and lack of accountability is disgusting.\n\nThe level of mental gymnastics they\u2019re doing to make you out to be a bad guy (girl) in this situation is beyond Olympic level.", "NTA \n\nSupporting family is important, but it wasn't a dire emergency. Potentially getting in trouble at work trumps covering for your brother's bad behavior. \n\nDrink drivers are people who deserve to face the full consequences of their actions, including telling their parents about how awfully they fucked up.", "I wouldn't pick up anyone who was arrested for drunk driving,  no matter what I had going on, family or not.", "NTA apologize for what making him face the consequences of his actions?", "NTA he decided to drive drunk.

In addition to nobody owing drunk drivers anything, he tied your hands by not giving you enough notice to pick him up without being late for work.

Most likely he drove while drunk multiple times already without being caught. Do not enable him by hiding what he did!", "Is this post even real? Just in case it is, NTA. Your brother is lucky he didn't kill somebody, and should be glad your parents even picked him up. Your mom is just protecting his feelings, but ignoring the headline.

You didn't take his phone or wallet  Literally, the only reason why you were involved at all was because HE is your brother!\n\nHe clearly knows what he did was wrong, illegal and unacceptable, which is why he wanted you to participate in a lie to your parents.

And your parents are trying to enable that?\n\nSeriously, think about it. He KNEW he was wrong. Your parents know he was wrong. But you were expected to be late to your job, which could result in your termination. Your termination would mean no money. No money and no job runs the very real risk of homelessness.

Not your responsibility at all.", "My bad on the misgendering, but the sentiment remains the same and very much in agreement with you.", "No, but releasing someone from a police station for drunk driving typically does. My best friend's brother is on *at least* DUI #3 (some as a minor, which is how he can still drive. He's a moron. A nice one, but a moron.) \n\nIt took (as far as I'm aware): \n\n1) 4 hours \n\n2) 3.5 hours \n\n3) let him sit overnight, then still took 6. \n\nA few other pickups/releases for different issues have taken similar lengths of time. And that's all at a well funded, well liked police station where they weren't likely to try to be assholes (just knowing the department behavior/culture for that particular area), it's just slow AF to get anything even tangentially related to the court system sometimes.", "I think they are saying the brother was lying about it taking 5 minutes to pick him up/drop him off. At least, that's how I read it.", "Not everyone lives in a city.", "Right, that idiot could have taken lives. He\u2019s not apologetic over that. Instead, he has the nerve to demand an apology from OP.", "You don't risk your job for being late once especially if you call in advance, don't invent things", "Huh? If a place has costumer facing positions they obviously never have just one person. It's also an assumption, so i will assume op does not work with customers.", "People who drink and drive don't deserve to have a car.", "which is a very likely way to end up with no money the next day", "That's where the money went.", "\u201cDon\u2019t threaten me with a good time\u201d", "I mean, it\u2019s gonna be awkward at the next family dinner I guess", "Not everywhere has those apps, my city doesn\u2019t", "Rural areas don't have Uber.", "Boy that would have prevented this problem from the get go. The absolute irony here\u2026", "I don\u2019t know, he didn\u2019t tell me anything.\n\nLike I said, we\u2019re not close, I don\u2019t know who he\u2019s hanging out with", "No, we\u2019re talking when we eat at my parents, family dinners and sometimes on Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s Day to make sure we\u2019re not having the same ideas gifts but that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t even know what his apartment look like", "And supporting family doesn't mean you have to drop everything you are doing. Sometimes they need to suffer the consequences.", "You and OP's mom* have a lot in common. Namely defending a drunk 27 year old man's poor choices.", "Better way to support your kids is letting them deal with and face the natural consequences of their actions. He chose to drive drunk. Luckily the natural consequence was just getting busted by the cops and not killing himself or others.", "You don't know. It's not inventing things.", "The point is you dont know whether OP's work is time sensitive or not, so why would she risk it to pick up this garbage of a person who chose to drink and drive", "Doesn't make it GTA any less unfortunately", "Only for your brother and mother. If your brother hadn\u2019t been driving drunk and putting other motorists and pedestrians in danger, he wouldn\u2019t have been in jail. It wouldn\u2019t have killed him to walk home. He should be embarrassed by his behavior. Your mother should be disappointed in him for exercising poor judgment and herself for enabling your brother.", "The only thing you know is that \n\n1- he\u2019s her brother\n\n2- he was arrested for drunk driving. \n\nEverything else is guesswork on your part.  You\u2019ve already assumed he\u2019s guilty and you\u2019re ready to play judge and jury anonymously behind your keyboard. Pretty sad.\n\nDidn\u2019t the George Floyd episode teach you anything about cops?", "I don't know, so i go with the average. The average job does not risk anything being half an hour late.", "Don't worry, according to this person, being half an hour late to your job isn't any kind of risk at all.", "Why are you assuming she risks, if you just agreed that we don't know.", "sorry but if someone is in jail for drunk and driving - how can you 'assume' otherwise.. police must have done a drunk sobreity test to determine he was over the limit and he was likely driving erratically for a police to notice him..", "Well that's nice but the point still stands. It's a risk that didn't need to be taken.", "It isn't, have you ever had a job?", "I just explained you that it is not a risk", "I have, and I wouldn't RISK being half an hour late for someone else being a dumbass.", "Just because YOU don't think that it's not, does not make it so.", "Doesn't sound like it. I bet thats a lie"]}
