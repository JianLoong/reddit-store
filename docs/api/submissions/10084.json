We are out to our families and friends as a couple. I came out at 22 years old. \n\nMy younger sister \"Sarah\" (24F) announced her pregnancy to immediately family two months ago. My mom (55F) and Sarah have been planning her gender reveal party ever since. It's a grand occasion with nearly every person she's ever known plus our entire family. It's all being funded by my mother since Sarah's her golden child. My siblings and I were supportive of all the fanciness since it's the first grandkid in the family. \n\nI received my official invitation over text two weeks ago. In that message, Sarah said I would be free to bring Rob as she knows that we're basically inseparable and that he's practically a part of the family now. I replied that I would be coming and bringing Rob.\n\nFast forward two weeks to last night, the big night. Rob and I got to the party a little early to help set up like my mom had asked us to do. As soon as we entered the house, Sarah ushered us off to the side and quietly asked us to \"not act so couple-y tonight.\" I was kind of shocked but I thought it was because she didn't want anything to overshadow her big day. Rob seemed kind of annoyed but we agreed to not do anything \"embarrassing\" and started to help Mom set up.\n\nEverything went okay for an hour or so and then we sat down to eat. Rob and I sat across from this girl and guy who apparently were a couple. We started talking and really hit it off.  At some point, the guy made a joke, something along the lines of \"Hey, you better not be flirting with my girlfriend!\". I laughed and joked back, saying that I wouldn't want to start a fight with my boyfriend. We laughed about it. I noticed Sarah getting up from the head of the table and storming over. She asked to talk to me and pulled me away from the table to whisper-yell at me for telling her friends that Rob and I were dating after she \"asked me not to\". I was confused and said that she asked us to not act \"couple-y\" but not pretend that we aren't one. She got mad and told me that it was the same thing. I asked what was so wrong with a couple of friends finding out about my relationship. She said it was because she \"didn't want her friends to know that her baby would be raised around the LGBT.\" \n\nAt that point I was stunned. She has never been anything but supportive of me. I left her standing there and went back to the table. The couple sitting across from us asked why we were leaving so soon and I told them that \"my sister didn't want a couple of gay guys around her kid so I'm just respecting her wishes a little early\". We grabbed our stuff and left.\n\nMy phone has been blowing up with texts. Sarah cusses me out for leaving the party and \"disobeying\" her wishes and Mom begs to know why I left early. At this point, I don't care about Sarah or her kid but I feel like I should have just apologized and shut up instead of causing a ton of drama.\n\nSo...

You should be free to be yourself and your family should support you no matter who is watching. I feel like your sister trying to hide your relationship like that shows that she might low key be ashamed. I know you said she has always been supportive, but that\u2019s also during times where she doesn\u2019t have skin in the game. She needs to take a long look inside herself and stop enforcing old prejudices. \n\nHer child is going to be exposed to LGBTQ+ regardless, because people of all sexual orientations exist in the world and all are worthy of representation. Having a child exposed to that early on and have it be normalized will only create a better future for all of us.", "NTA.

I feel sorry for her future kid.", "NTA - If your sister is going to be prioritising her homophobic friends over you then it's probably best you cut her out of your life ASAP, I'm sorry to say.", "NTA- That was super homophobic of her and she can\u2019t possibly support you if she\u2019s going to do both you and your boyfriend like that.

There was no reason for you two to continue dealing with the hate your sister was spewing.", "NTA\n\nYour sister caused the drama, not you.\n\nHer comment about her friends is very strange.  The way she said it is like she's fine with her baby being brought up around LGBT people but she doesn't want her friends to know which makes no sense.  I'd have thought it was something you're either fully on board about or you're not.  She needs to decide what's more important - her friends' opinions or her brother.  \n\nThe fact that you seemed to be getting on really well with her friends makes it even more baffling.", "Nta.

Dealt with that with an ex's daughter who didn't want me around her children because her husband's family was ultra religious and a high ranking bishop in the church.  Mind you it was the deal breaker when she finally admitted it and I told him never to offer her or the grandchildren help using my money again, as well as ever being welcome at our home.  He chose his family for obvious reasons, but I didn't regret my decision to end it after 5 years.\n\nJust be up front with the family and explain that they can't play both sides and supporting her homophobia is not going to give them the right to only accept part of who you are.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry she decided that was the time to expose her homophobia. It\u2019s only okay to her if it stays in the background, out of sight.", "Absolutely NTA. Be sure to explain your reasons for leaving plainly to anyone who asks.", "NTA\n\nHowever, OP, if this is out of character and has never done this before, I would be concerned. \n\nSome weird stuff happens in pregnancy. Hormones, psychosis etc. \n\nBefore you go super nuclear, I would definitely have a sit down with her and your mom present and discuss what the heck led her to this. If she is exhibiting weird behaviour that hasn\u2019t been the case before it should be checked out. If it\u2019s true colours coming out\u2026 then this is different, but best to cover all bases. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you are going through this Op.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
