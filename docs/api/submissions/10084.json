We are out to our families and friends as a couple. I came out at 22 years old. \n\nMy younger sister \"Sarah\" (24F) announced her pregnancy to immediately family two months ago. My mom (55F) and Sarah have been planning her gender reveal party ever since. It's a grand occasion with nearly every person she's ever known plus our entire family. It's all being funded by my mother since Sarah's her golden child. My siblings and I were supportive of all the fanciness since it's the first grandkid in the family. \n\nI received my official invitation over text two weeks ago. In that message, Sarah said I would be free to bring Rob as she knows that we're basically inseparable and that he's practically a part of the family now. I replied that I would be coming and bringing Rob.\n\nFast forward two weeks to last night, the big night. Rob and I got to the party a little early to help set up like my mom had asked us to do. As soon as we entered the house, Sarah ushered us off to the side and quietly asked us to \"not act so couple-y tonight.\" I was kind of shocked but I thought it was because she didn't want anything to overshadow her big day. Rob seemed kind of annoyed but we agreed to not do anything \"embarrassing\" and started to help Mom set up.\n\nEverything went okay for an hour or so and then we sat down to eat. Rob and I sat across from this girl and guy who apparently were a couple. We started talking and really hit it off.  At some point, the guy made a joke, something along the lines of \"Hey, you better not be flirting with my girlfriend!\". I laughed and joked back, saying that I wouldn't want to start a fight with my boyfriend. We laughed about it. I noticed Sarah getting up from the head of the table and storming over. She asked to talk to me and pulled me away from the table to whisper-yell at me for telling her friends that Rob and I were dating after she \"asked me not to\". I was confused and said that she asked us to not act \"couple-y\" but not pretend that we aren't one. She got mad and told me that it was the same thing. I asked what was so wrong with a couple of friends finding out about my relationship. She said it was because she \"didn't want her friends to know that her baby would be raised around the LGBT.\" \n\nAt that point I was stunned. She has never been anything but supportive of me. I left her standing there and went back to the table. The couple sitting across from us asked why we were leaving so soon and I told them that \"my sister didn't want a couple of gay guys around her kid so I'm just respecting her wishes a little early\". We grabbed our stuff and left.\n\nMy phone has been blowing up with texts. Sarah cusses me out for leaving the party and \"disobeying\" her wishes and Mom begs to know why I left early. At this point, I don't care about Sarah or her kid but I feel like I should have just apologized and shut up instead of causing a ton of drama.\n\nSo...

Everybody knows that the gender reveal party is the moment the baby develops the gender the parents picked by picking colors. If a lgbtq+  person is present at the gender reveal party the baby is automatically infected with the lgbtq+ virus because exposed to it during gender development process. \n\nYour such a numbnut for not knowing this basic step of embryo development. \n\nThis also works with babyshowers if there was no gender reveal. Babys that hadn't had neither will be born without any gender. Thats why gender reveal parties are so important and everybody has them.\n\n/s", " Shmuchk Sarah. She\u2019s AHA.", "NTA.

You shouldn't have been asked to not act \"couple-y\" unless your behaviour would have been generally inappropriate. You definitely shouldn't have to pretend you're not a couple.

I mean seriously who behaves like that", "An undercover bigot.  The worst kind.  If that's how she's going to act, then it's time to cut her out.  Does she expect you to never act like a couple around her friends?  I imagine there will be more family gatherings where she wouldn't want you to be \"coupley.\"  Clearly she doesn't care about your feelings, only what her friends think.

I just wish I knew exactly what's going on.", "I just had this thought this morning. It very well could be her pregnancy hormones. It could be her homophobia.

Good luck with all!", "Absolutely. If she agrees, I'll even go with her to a doctor juts to make sure everything's okay. If it does end up being a medical condition, I'll have to think very hard on how I want to handle it. I may distance myself, but not completely. It is her baby and her rules.", "And you\u2019d think the couple at the table wouldn\u2019t be asking why you\u2019re leaving early if they took issue.

I tried to edit my message but Reddit glitched and wouldn't let me. I think that if her child turned out gay without my involvement at all she would have some thinking to do. I would never ever wish a child harm, LGBTQ+ or not. My sister would become ostracized from our family and we would make sure her child was taken away from her.
