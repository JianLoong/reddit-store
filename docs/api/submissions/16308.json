You were nice enough to offer all the answers for him to copy but he refused. It's his problem now", "NTA.\n\nIf his English is really bad, you should give him this to turn in:\n\nQ:  Who actually did this homework assignment?\n\nA:  This was written by my brother because I kept having tantrums and not letting him sleep. \n\nQ:  Why am I turning this homework in?  \n\nA:  Because my brother knows I can't read what this says.", "NTA. By doing the work for him, it's not helping him learn or grow in the long run.", "NTA. You've been helping him out as his brother, but he should be doing his own homework so he can actually learn something.", "NTA\n\nHe needs to do his own work.", "NTA- he needs to do his own work.", "NTA. No language issues in my family, but my mother would INSIST that I do my youngest siblings art and science projects. Not for any other reason besides I was \"the best at those two things.\" And for a while I did, but then I had my daughter and went back to school myself, so I had to try and explain to her that I'm sorry but between being a mom, going to college, and taking care of all the house chores and cooking (I lived with then at the time) that I didn't have time to do her projects on top of mine. To make matters worse, my sister wasn't even doing her other homework herself, my mom was. And what was even worse is that she and my other 2 sisters went to cyber school, completely from home (my mom pulled them out of public school after I graduated). The oldest of the three was held back twice. The middle is autistic, so clearly never got the help she needed properly and only graduated cus she aged out at 21. The youngest, whom I did the projects for, was also held back twice, nearly expelled for lack of attendance...to an online school... and will be 20 in November, and I honestly don't even know whether or not she's graduating this year... So no, you are NTA. Language issues aside, your parents are setting your sibling up for a future of trouble and failure if they don't make then do their own homework.", "ESH.
