Does that mean letting bad things slide? No. Be respectful, reasonable, and most importantly, an *adult* about the situation. Your husbands and your older sons reaction is very justified. Maybe it\u2019s a cultural thing, but for me, no matter how little of the thing is left, slapping food out of somebody\u2019s hands is unacceptable.

You either try to shield your kids from it or teach them to have thicker skin and not let it get to them. Otherwise when they won\u2019t have you around, they won\u2019t know how to deal with it. Also, if it\u2019s just teasing about being vegetarian, I wouldn\u2019t even consider that bullying.", "No. My point was that a little light teasing about things is something everyone should know how to handle. I wasn\u2019t bullied by my siblings. But, I have had fights and arguments with my sister, going all the way till now. Growing up in a low income house, we were left alone to just do our own thing. We fought, we called each other names, but somehow, someway, we both always knew when it went too far. One would cry, the other would apologize and not do it again. That is, to me, why siblings are so close. They fight, they\u2019re at each others throats, but they they always know when there\u2019s something off with the other (when often parents don\u2019t even know). You need to leave your kids to have their own relationship. Not just a relationship that\u2019s governed by you. In my opinion, it\u2019s practice for outside relationships when they may have to set boundaries or communicate their dissatisfaction with somebody\u2019s behavior. They won\u2019t have you there to slap the food out of somebody else\u2019s hands. I believe they can handle their own siblings. Again, you know your situation better.

I\u2019m not saying this for the older son, i\u2019m saying it for the younger. He needs to learn how to dish it out.

His brother eat his cheese pizza, they fought and caused a mess, knocking cola everywhere etc. Kid got no dinner and sent to his room. \nWorse than that, when cleaning up the table, his Dad didn't see the kids flight ticket and it got swepped with the wet kitchen paper into the bin. \nKid spent Christmas home alone. \nThe story carries on getting wild, but that's for another thread I suspect.", "Well, you're NTA for the pizza comment, but wtf are you doing about your sons?

They do have an issue with the cheese pizza.
