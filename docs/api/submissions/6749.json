I told her no because I wasn't ready and she agreed. Today she sends me a text with a picture showing she got a new dog. We fought all day and I can't stop crying. I feel like she is trying to force me on this and im not ready. Would I be the asshole if I make her take the dog back?\n She wants to wait until I meet the dog in 3 weeks. She says i love her. I dont want to love her.\nI said thats an absurd time to wait. Then the dog gets used to it and I won't do that at that point. You either take the dog back the day of or day after. Nothing can't.\nSo what do you all think?\n\nEdit: we are only living separately because she is living with her sick mother.\n\nEdit 2: I have also been with my girlfriend for close to 15 years.

I do know one thing for sure; I am thinking about the dog when I say the longer your girlfriend has it, the more horrendous it is going to be for the dog to be returned. Dogs don't emotionally or psychologically well when they bond with someone and then are jerked into an unknown environment. They become fearful and untrusting of people and this can result in behavior problems which could prevent the animal from being rehomed.\nI think probably you are right now in a tug-of-war over who is going to be Mr./Miss Right. If you're moving in together soon anyone, give up the ego and trying to be Mr. Right and allow the dog to become a member of your family.

That would be impossible. \n\nAlso, I\u2019ll let you in on a little secret that I learned last year when my heart dog died: HAVING A NEW DOG IN YOUR LIFE WILL NOT STOP YOUR GRIEVING! \n\nStory Time: My soulmate dog Winnie died at 4 years old on New Year\u2019s Day 2022. She was only four years old and her death was swift an unexpected. She ended up septic from a bowel perforation caused by something she managed to scavenge during the Christmas holiday. I had poured 4.5 years into training, loving and bonding with that dog. I trained her to work as a hospital therapy dog, she was an accomplished Trick Dog, and I even ran a moderately successful Instagram for her. That dog dying absolutely gutted me. However, I was currently 12w pregnant and my husband and mom realized that I would eventually want another dog of the same breed. They knew that we could either get one immediately so that basic training could be completed before the baby arrived or wait 3ish years. Plus, I literally would not eat or get out of the bed so they were afraid I would have a miscarriage. It turned out the breeder of my original pup\u2019s father had a 7w old litter with a single female. They knew that dog would have the good temperament and health of my lost dog. So I had a new puppy in my house 2 weeks later. As much as I didn\u2019t want to bond with her the act of caring for the puppy at least distracted me from actively wallowing. The puppy is a great dog. She\u2019s sweet, smart, and gentle. But I still cried everyday for 3 months when I took that puppy out to potty or to training classes and she didn\u2019t perform exactly how Winnie would have on a task. She\u2019s definitely not my Winnie Girl. But, she\u2019s a good dog and I\u2019m glad I have her. She respects the baby\u2019s space and is the most gentle, goofy soul and I love her on her own merits. But she\u2019s not Winnie and she will never be. Even if I would have waited 5+ years I\u2019m positive nothing could keep me from comparing the two. \n\nThe moral of my story is that your heart can expand to love another dog, but that isn\u2019t going to take place of your grief. If you are lucky your capacity to love will grow bigger so the grief doesn\u2019t seem as overwhelming, but the grief won\u2019t go away.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The fact that the mother is so sick that OPs girlfriend had to move out of her home and move in with her but ALSO there\u2019s a set time that she\u2019s definitely no question moving back by is also odd. \n\nI\u2019m not definitively saying OP is making it up or exaggerating the details, just that my radar is up on this one. The initial post is not worded in a way that makes me think OP had been living with girlfriend previously, and I think from the confusion in the comments, I\u2019m not the only one. Even the 15 years is confusing because it\u2019s both the length of the relationship and when OP got the dog, but only one of those is in the original post."]}
