I do know one thing for sure; I am thinking about the dog when I say the longer your girlfriend has it, the more horrendous it is going to be for the dog to be returned. Dogs don't emotionally or psychologically well when they bond with someone and then are jerked into an unknown environment. They become fearful and untrusting of people and this can result in behavior problems which could prevent the animal from being rehomed.\nI think probably you are right now in a tug-of-war over who is going to be Mr./Miss Right. If you're moving in together soon anyone, give up the ego and trying to be Mr. Right and allow the dog to become a member of your family.

That would be impossible. \n\nAlso, I\u2019ll let you in on a little secret that I learned last year when my heart dog died: HAVING A NEW DOG IN YOUR LIFE WILL NOT STOP YOUR GRIEVING! \n\nStory Time: My soulmate dog Winnie died at 4 years old on New Year\u2019s Day 2022. She was only four years old and her death was swift an unexpected. She ended up septic from a bowel perforation caused by something she managed to scavenge during the Christmas holiday. I had poured 4.5 years into training, loving and bonding with that dog. I trained her to work as a hospital therapy dog, she was an accomplished Trick Dog, and I even ran a moderately successful Instagram for her. That dog dying absolutely gutted me. However, I was currently 12w pregnant and my husband and mom realized that I would eventually want another dog of the same breed. They knew that we could either get one immediately so that basic training could be completed before the baby arrived or wait 3ish years. Plus, I literally would not eat or get out of the bed so they were afraid I would have a miscarriage. It turned out the breeder of my original pup\u2019s father had a 7w old litter with a single female. They knew that dog would have the good temperament and health of my lost dog. So I had a new puppy in my house 2 weeks later. As much as I didn\u2019t want to bond with her the act of caring for the puppy at least distracted me from actively wallowing. The puppy is a great dog. She\u2019s sweet, smart, and gentle. But I still cried everyday for 3 months when I took that puppy out to potty or to training classes and she didn\u2019t perform exactly how Winnie would have on a task. She\u2019s definitely not my Winnie Girl. But, she\u2019s a good dog and I\u2019m glad I have her. She respects the baby\u2019s space and is the most gentle, goofy soul and I love her on her own merits. But she\u2019s not Winnie and she will never be. Even if I would have waited 5+ years I\u2019m positive nothing could keep me from comparing the two. \n\nThe moral of my story is that your heart can expand to love another dog, but that isn\u2019t going to take place of your grief. If you are lucky your capacity to love will grow bigger so the grief doesn\u2019t seem as overwhelming, but the grief won\u2019t go away.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Am I the asshole for telling her that she's intentionally crossed my boundaries and I'll ~~move out~~ not move in with her if she tries to impose this on me?\"", "They live together, she\u2019s just temporarily taking care of her sick mother.", "How do you know OP is male?\n\nThat aside, at this point I\u2019m not sure what information is most accurate or how this couple communicates. I still think OP would be TA. (I also think girlfriend sucks, but that\u2019s neither here nor there.)", "I read that too. So confused", "Agreed. He can ask not demand. Just unfortunate she seemed to disregard his feelings there.", "They're moving in together and it sounds like she got the dog for him. If she wants it for herself though he should try to make the best of it but he's NTA for asking her. If he demands her then he's TA.", "How long have you lived apart?", "Just because you lived together for so long doesn't mean you will again. It sounds to me like you're taking this relationship for granted just as much as she's jeopardizing it.   \n\n\nThere's no way for you to make her take back the dog. But it does sound like she's trying to force the dog on you emotionally and she's not respecting what you say about your feelings.   \n\n\nI think there are bigger problems here than a puppy, and you both have a lot of talking to do.   \n\n\nGood luck.", "Yeah I reread it and realised I misread it so deleted my comment. It\u2019s a no brainer - it\u2019s not his dog and she can buy a dog if she wants. His overreaction made me think she bought it for him", "[deleted]", "OP saying \"living separately FOR THE TIME BEING\" alludes to them living together typically, as well as previously to the girlfriends mother being sick. Which means she'll be moving BACK in with OP at some point. So no, its not HER home, HER decision. Its THEIR home, THEIR decision, and she mad eit unilaterally, like an ass.\n\nEdited to add judgment: NTA, OP", "I disagree. If they were married she'd be an AH for buying a new pet that he expressly didn't want given his understandable feelings on the subject, but if they're not married then she's not obliged to let him have the deciding vote.", "I read he had Bella for 15 years.  Not the girlfriend.", "No. They don\u2019t live together. OP says \u201conce we move in together\u201d, not once she moves back in. I\u2019m 100% sure they have never lived together.", "He/she is irrelevant.  I am going by his post unless otherwise proven wrong.", "She is being pushy with the comments about how he's sure to love her new dog. It does sound like she's being willfully deaf to what he's saying about his feelings, and that is an AH move.   \n\n\nIt doesn't give him the right to control her purchases, though.", "Maybe reread. OP says gf is thinking of getting a \u201cfriend\u201d for HER OWN DOG THAT SHE ALREADY OWNS. At this time both dogs are hers, living in her own home.", "Did he say that? Did op say his GF agreed to move back in with him?", "What a shitty ass way to view relationships. They've been together for FIFTEEN YEARS and just because they aren't married they can do whatever the fuck they want without thinking of how it'll effect their partner? What lmfao.", "Then you\u2019re fine with him asking her to not move back in when the issues with her mother are resolved?", "They've been living together for 15 years! They're only apart temporarily while she looks after her sick mother. They are effectively married and she's just bought an animal that she absolutely expects to bring into their shared home.", "I understand what you're saying, but they are common law married after living together for 15 years. Since she's only temporarily living apart from him with the expectation to move back in when her mother is better I think it was an AH move for her to get a dog her partner wasn't ready for. He isn't an AH for requesting she return it because it is expected she's living with him again soon. And it sounds like he has the interest of the dog at heart too because he is asking her to give it back now, beclfore it gets attached to her, rather than when she moves back with him.", "Me, too. But everybody else saying differently so I figured I was wrong.", "I reread and realized that you're right, they haven't yet lived together. I'll update my comment.", "I only mention it because OP has made previous posts about losing their bra.\n\nThe initial post stated outright that they do not live together. I made my call based on that. They updated it with new but ambiguous information. If I had a partner of 15 years who lived with me and who temporarily was staying elsewhere\u2026 I would not say they did not live with me. I would not describe one of our dogs as belonging to them, and one of our dogs as belonging to me. OP\u2019s information is inherently unclear.", "I agree. I think if he made demands he would be TA but if he's just asking and they can discuss it he's NTA", "He literally said it lmao. Some of you people really need to brush up your reading comprehension skills", "He made it very clear", "15 years but not in it for the long haul", "Nah, I read it wrong. You had it right the first time. I've changed my wording to reflect that.", "OP made a bunch of edits and comments after people started calling them the AH. I don\u2019t even know what the actual living arrangement is, was or going to be. And that is important for judgement, imo.", "He's  making demands,not asking\n\n> AITAH for *telling my girlfriend to take her new dog back*?\n\n>  Would I be the asshole if *I make her take the dog back*?", "Where did OP say \u201cmy gf already agreed to move back in with me?\u201d Before I made my comment.", "He never lmao brush up on your skills", "He didn\u2019t say the GF wants to move back in with him he only said he would like to.", "Why do you think that??", "Not everyone feels the need to get married", "He said in the post that they are moving back in together \"sometime this year\". I assume that means when mom passes.", "So you're moving the goal post so you can be right? Lmao get off the internet and see somebody for whatever problems you have. I'll guess an inferiority complex for sure.", "Just admit you\u2019ve read it wrong like everyone else has been telling you.", "I don't know how to link it on mobile but you made your wrong comment 45 minutes ago, and his first comment stating they did live together and will be again is written an hour ago. In case you need as much help in math as you do reading comprehension, that's  a whole 15 minutes before you posted your own dumb comment. Have a nice night\ud83d\ude07", "Reread the post and his own comment. Idk what tf else y'all want me to do for you lmao", "Lmao it says right in the post that they\u2019re moving back in together \u201csometime this year\u201d. Reading is hard :(", "I was being sarcastic", "I didn't but still called my partner my husband.", "I\u2019m still waiting for a link of a comment by op made before my comment saying \u201cMy GF and I already agreed to move in together before she got the dog\u201d", "It's in the original post.....\n\n> We also talked about her getting a \"friend\" for her dog but he will have one once we move in together. Sometime this year.", "They\u2019ve lived together for 15 years, OP has very clearly said that they\u2019re are only living separately \u201cWHILE\u201d the GF is taking care of their sick mother.\n\nIt is so obviously clear that it is a temporarily situation that will be resolved after her taking care of her mother."]}
