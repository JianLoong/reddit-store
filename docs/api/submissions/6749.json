I do know one thing for sure; I am thinking about the dog when I say the longer your girlfriend has it, the more horrendous it is going to be for the dog to be returned. Dogs don't emotionally or psychologically well when they bond with someone and then are jerked into an unknown environment. They become fearful and untrusting of people and this can result in behavior problems which could prevent the animal from being rehomed.\nI think probably you are right now in a tug-of-war over who is going to be Mr./Miss Right. If you're moving in together soon anyone, give up the ego and trying to be Mr. Right and allow the dog to become a member of your family.

You don\u2019t want that new dog to ever feel like a replacement for the one you lost, and that\u2019s how you would feel getting attached to a new dog right now.

That would be impossible. \n\nAlso, I\u2019ll let you in on a little secret that I learned last year when my heart dog died: HAVING A NEW DOG IN YOUR LIFE WILL NOT STOP YOUR GRIEVING! \n\nStory Time: My soulmate dog Winnie died at 4 years old on New Year\u2019s Day 2022. She was only four years old and her death was swift an unexpected. She ended up septic from a bowel perforation caused by something she managed to scavenge during the Christmas holiday. I had poured 4.5 years into training, loving and bonding with that dog. I trained her to work as a hospital therapy dog, she was an accomplished Trick Dog, and I even ran a moderately successful Instagram for her. That dog dying absolutely gutted me. However, I was currently 12w pregnant and my husband and mom realized that I would eventually want another dog of the same breed. They knew that we could either get one immediately so that basic training could be completed before the baby arrived or wait 3ish years. Plus, I literally would not eat or get out of the bed so they were afraid I would have a miscarriage. It turned out the breeder of my original pup\u2019s father had a 7w old litter with a single female. They knew that dog would have the good temperament and health of my lost dog. So I had a new puppy in my house 2 weeks later. As much as I didn\u2019t want to bond with her the act of caring for the puppy at least distracted me from actively wallowing. The puppy is a great dog. She\u2019s sweet, smart, and gentle. But I still cried everyday for 3 months when I took that puppy out to potty or to training classes and she didn\u2019t perform exactly how Winnie would have on a task. She\u2019s definitely not my Winnie Girl. But, she\u2019s a good dog and I\u2019m glad I have her. She respects the baby\u2019s space and is the most gentle, goofy soul and I love her on her own merits. But she\u2019s not Winnie and she will never be. Even if I would have waited 5+ years I\u2019m positive nothing could keep me from comparing the two. \n\nThe moral of my story is that your heart can expand to love another dog, but that isn\u2019t going to take place of your grief. If you are lucky your capacity to love will grow bigger so the grief doesn\u2019t seem as overwhelming, but the grief won\u2019t go away.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You don't live together, and after this I highly doubt you will. Yes, your grief for your pet is real and needs to be respected, but she has gotten the dog for herself, not you. I gather you made multiple edits to your post, so my take on the  one I read is, you do not live with her, so don't get to dictate her getting a cat, dog, gerbil or goldfish.", "OP identifies herself as female in the first sentence. I can\u2019t believe how many people keep referring to her as \u201chim\u201d in these comments.\n\nNTA yet. They talked about getting another dog, OP expressed she isn\u2019t ready and her girlfriend goes and gets one anyway. Op would be TA if she tried to force her to bring the dog back, but getting the dog after discussing it was an AH move.", "YTA. Make her take it back?   Excuse me?", "Kind think your description makes her the asshole. We're not judging his feelings - just his actions.\n\nYta\n\nEdit: pronoun", "The dog isn't the deal breaker, but the girlfriend being so insensitive and disregarding OPs feelings might just as well be. After 15 years together I expect a bit more regard for each other than not being able to wait a bit longer until OP is ready for a new dog (as she said \"not just yet\" not that she doesn't want one at all). It's like her grief, her feelings don't matter at all to her girlfriend.", "How long until you live together again? Because honestly that\u2019s my deciding factor here.", "Indeed, you really need to fight this right now, cuz it doesn't matter how long you two have been together, her trying to erase your grief and make solo decisions for your joint household is a problem.\n\nYou've broken up before, this might be the point to break up again and this time permanently", "Yes they did, in the post the partner made it very clear that she got the dog to force the poster to let go of their grief for the dog they lost and move on. The partner made it very clear that this dog is a replacement dog so the poster is forced to no longer grieve.", "I really think the poster has a right to demand that she gets rid of the dog, given that the girlfriend has very plainly put it that the main reason she got this dog is to force it on to the poster to erase their grief.\n\nIt is right to tell someone that they should take back and animal that they are going to try and force on you, you can't sign somebody up for the physical responsibility of taking care of an animal, but also the emotional element of telling someone that they aren't allowed to grieve and that they just have to move on and take care of this new dog and forget about the old one.", "Maybe because in the original post OP didn't mention she's a woman and most people jumped to conclusions so she added this in an edit. Depending on when this edit happened, some people obviously didn't know and assumed she's a him. \n\n> Edit 2: I have also been with my girlfriend for close to 15 years. We have lived together before and will again soon. This is just temporary.\n\nAgree on this one. Not only this, but girlfriend asked OP, OP said no, girlfriend AGREES to not get a dog and than does it anyway and now expects OP to love the new dog and move in with it (together with the combined existing 2 dogs)... definitely ok.", "*her - OP and her girlfriend are both female.\n\nAnd the girlfriend already has a dog, she got a second one, it's not that she's all alone. And OP just said they're not ready yet, not that they never want a new dog again... after 15 years together I'd expect a bit more respect for my feelings when I am grieving the loss of my furry companion.", "Please can you copy and paste the exact bit it says that as I've read it numerous times and fail to see it. \n\nI know she spoke about getting a new dog but also said that she wanted a new dog to be a friend for her dog. \n\nWhich is why I asked OP but thanks for taking the time.", "That may not happen. They have spoken multiple times about getting a dog, so obviously, she knew the OP's feelings about it. She just decided she wanted a dog more than she cared that OP did not want one. It is up to OP whether she wants to live with them or continue the relationship. It isn't up to them whether another adult gets a dog.", "Ok. Do we know when they\u2019re moving back in together? Because if it\u2019s not for a year or two that\u2019s a moot point.\n\nI still don\u2019t agree that he can tell his gf to give the dog away.", "I just saw his second edit where he clarifies that, thank you.", "Except your changes don't account for the fact that they have lived together previously, her GF has only moved out to care for her sick mother and will be moving back.  You make it sound like a new relationship and OP is being unreasonable.", "Yes its up to THEM not just her. I might not happen but as far as OP tells us it will so OP is not the AH she is for getting a dog while disregarding OP\u2019s feelings", "This was written prior to the edit where he says they are only apart temporarily and lived together before.

YTA.", "Why are OP's feelings more important than their gf's feelings?", "OP is also a woman", ">He is female/she", "Or \u201conly\u201d means that their partner\u2019s ill parent is the only reason they haven\u2019t YET moved in together.", "Huh.  It is the night for it.  I am getting roasted because after carefully reading one statement three times in a row, I still got it wrong and based a comment regarding age on my error.\n\nsheesh.  And of course, getting away from the post for a bit and the first thing when I read it again, is duh\u2026.how could I get that wrong?", "OP just lost her dog?? That\u2019ll cause one much pain and sadness and it\u2019ll take time to get over it and for her to get a new dog while OP has told her multiple times OP is not ready for it is a dick move. She can wait to get another dog, how do OP\u2019s feelings not matter more? If she doesnt gaf about OP why are they even together", "OP is a woman.

It will probably be more months until they live together again, and OP will have to interact with the dog daily. How long does her sadness give her unilateral veto over the other person's desire for a pet?", "Sick burn", "The other person already has a pet so i think she can wait a little longer. I dont see how her getting an new pet means more than OP\u2019s mourning tbh and its so rude. We don\u2019t know how much longer it\u2019ll take for her to move back so im not gonna make assumptions but OP is in her rights to be mad and her gf shouldn\u2019t force OP to be okay with it and to love her", "OP is a woman", "Oh shit. Fixed. I got caught up in the thread convo and missed it", "YTA\u2026 1. A girlfriend for 15years? Sounds like you can\u2019t commit. \n2. You don\u2019t live together and can\u2019t commit so you have no say at all. \n3. She can do whatever she wants because you have been stringing her along for 15 years. \n4. It\u2019s her life and she needs to move on and maybe that\u2019s with a new dog. Because you can\u2019t commit.\n5.

I understand not wanting to \"replace\" a pet. I am the same way. However, it's not her new dog's fault they were adopted. It would be cruel and heartless to take them back. Pets are family members, not merchandise. \n\nAlso, she is allowed to adopt a dog. You don't have to care for the dog or even love them. I'm very sorry for your loss but don't punish this dog because of your grief.", "NTA \n\n\nYou are in a LTR and will be living together again soon. IMO the same courtesy of communication and understanding of marriage applies here. If you were together with separate homes then you would have no right to dictate what she does in her home. I find it a little concerning that she\u2019s made this decision despite your feelings.", "NTA- grieving takes time, HOWEVER it's her life and she can get one. If you aren't ready for another pet just distance yourself until you feel like you are", "Yta\n\nYou don\u2019t live together\u2026 it\u2019s at her house.

You are faced with a girlfriend who is going to force this dog on you or make it a wedge that comes between your relationship and moving back in together. \n\nShe's pretty sure you're going to pick her over the dog or she would not have made this move.\n\nMy recommendation is that you take the verbiage that a lot of smart and kind people here have recommended and to put your feelings in writing about where you are emotionally on this issue and send that to her.\n\nIf she still insists that she knows better than you about the depths of your own emotional well, then you have a choice to reevaluate if this is the right long-term partner going forward for you because this is a huge issue to have your feelings invalidated about and it certainly won't be the last.\n\nA year after our 13 and 15-year-old dogs passed away I asked my husband if he was interested in ever getting another dog and he said he didn't see himself ever wanting another dog again.\n\nWe won't be getting another dog.\n\nBecause that's how this works when you live with and care about the emotional well-being of the other person.

Your gf got a dog. Who are you to tell her she can't have a pet if she is the person responsible for it?\n\nYou are completely within your rights to refuse to engage with her new pet and refuse to contribute to its upkeep etc. But trying to make her take it back is the move of a controlling asshole.", "They're temporarily apart due to medical reasons.\n\nYou can't unilaterally get a dog when you know you are moving back in together.

Also the girlfriend agreed on not getting another dog, and than send OP a message with basically \"here's our new dog\"... so no OPs not the AH here. \n\nObviously the only thing she can decide is if she's moving back in with her with a 3rd dog or not (which will probably mean a break up). She can't actually force her to give the dog back, or \"make her\" do anything, I am sure she knows that and just worded it poorly out of distress.", "The last edit was 3 hours ago.
