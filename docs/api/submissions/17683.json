So NTA, but I wouldn't worry about her actually doing it. She might even just be messing with you (I hope).", "NTA even if it is *super* weird she is free to do as she pleases. I would ask her if she would be weirded out if you, after 18 were to go out with someone her age. I'm certain she would change her tune quickly.", "NTA\n\nIs your mom having some sort of midlife crisis??? This is weird as hell, is a twenty year age gap on someone youger than 25. An 18y brain is not even fully developed yet!!! Creepy", "Definitely weird", "NTA\n\nAsk her how she would act if you dated someone her age.", "NTA. A 20 year age gap is not going to lead to a healthy relationship.", "Half your age plus 7.  \n\nSo for your mom she shouldn't date anyone younger than 26.", "NTA but you need to realize she's purposely trying to make you upset because she thinks it's funny.  (Needless to say, this is an awful way to treat anyone, let alone your own daughter!)  You should probably stop taking the bait for your own sanity.", "NTA It sounds like you are more mature than your Mom.  Do you have anyone you can go to about this in your family.  Grandparents, Aunts, Uncles.  Sounds like first she had Daddy issues and now she wants to relive her missed 20s.  That should not be something for you to worry about.  She needs to grow up and raise you not compete with you.", "NTA- to my way of thinking she's being bordline abusive by repeatedly suggesting this knowing that it's deeply upsetting. I can't help but be really close to throwing the \"P\" word on her. Sounds like she stopped at 18 because it was as young as she could go where she wouldn't get in trouble, but only for that reason. Her mindset on this is waaaaay off.", "Your mom seems to almost be competing with you. Very weird behavior. She could use some therapy.\n\nNTA", "NTA for having an opinion, but at the end of the day, you don't get a say in who she dates. \n\nShe's definitely not winning any parenting awards. She also pretty obviously has some baggage about reliving her years that she spent as a young mother. \n\nIt sucks for you and you deserve a parent who would be more concerned about how their choices are going to affect you, but this is what you've got instead and it seems like how you feel isn't going to get factored in.", "Your mom is gross.  Nta", "NTA  that is some weird stuff", "You are not forbidding her from having a dating life.   It is highly inappropriate for ether parent to date some one who is close to their  children or children's age.\n\nJust because it is legal for her to do so doesnt mean it is ethical.\n\nNTA", "NTA she sounds like predator.", "That\u2019s SO predatory of your mom. NTA.", "NTA - I\u2019m also 38. Unless your mother is horribly immature, she has nothing in common with a 22 year old let alone an 18 year old. It\u2019s definitely weird. If it was the other way around, the older guy would be considered a predator by most people.", "NTA, it is understandable why you feel the way you do.\n\nUnfortunately, so long as your mother hasn\u2019t seen the 18 year old from school grow up (or hasn\u2019t interacted with him when he was under 16) she is entitled to date him as weird as it is", "NTA\n\nWe're creeping into borderline* predatory territory here...\n\n(*borderline because 18 is legally an adult but imo this is just... this surpasses weird for me).", "Your mom is her own woman, and as long as she's dating an adult, it's not your right to dictate what she can do. That being said, dating someone who is still in highschool is a huge no. Some say the rule is 1/2 age + 7 so for your mom 26, although really, any consenting adult is okay, but it depends where you live for how adult is described (18 in Europe, you have all adult rights, but in America no drinking until you're 21!?) If you're older, say 38, and you can't go to a bar with your SO because your authorities think they're too young....that's really disconcerting imo.\n\nNTA for telling your mom not to date someone from your school, but she's probably starting her midlife crisis and feels she's 'missed out on' her carefree 20s by having you so young. The fact she first flirted with someone who's 22 confirmed this for me.", "NTA for having your opinions, I agree with them tbh.\n\nBUUUTTTT\u2026.. she is an adult who can date who she wants (over the age of 18) , so just try and remember that when you talk to her about that.", "NTA. If she finds a boyfriend within 10 years of your age and their father is single, date their dad. Level the playing field lmao\n\nBut for real...your mom is super weird for being so adamant about wanting to date people who are just hitting legal adulthood and are still in high school or just barely past that and 20 years younger than her.\n\nLike if your mom was a dude, we'd be calling her a predator so that's something to think on.", "I mean, you're not an AH for thinking anything, but yelling at your mother over a hypothetical seems farfetched, even if you are right in that such an age difference at such a young age would be inappropriate with a potential to turn abusive. But honestly, it sounds like your mom was just joking around and you got needlessly riled up over it. \n\nAnd even if your mom was actually dating a guy nearly your age, explaining to her why it makes you uncomfortable should be done in a serious manner, not as bickering. \n\nSo ultimately I think NAH, but you're definitely overreacting.", "NTA for not liking the idea of your mother dating someone from your school.  Y T A for getting mad at a hypothetical situation.  Just let her know you don't like the idea of it and that is it.", "NTA\n\nThinking?  Sure, you're ok for thinking it's inappropriate.\n\nBut an 18 year old is an adult and can give consent.  Do ultimately there isn't anything wrong with it so long as there was no prior grooming and both adults are consenting.", "Once you get older you'll understand how your mother feels now. Let that woman be. My mom also dated guys around my age (I was over 25 by then) and it was fine. She was happy, guy was happy. It wont last, they know, but as long as everyone understand that, it's fine.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I am sure you do things or will do things that make her stomach turn or at the least she disagrees with but she will or has supported you. At least hopefully. Sharing your concerns about being bullied  at school if you went to school with a guy she dated is one thing but making it into an ethical or moral thing or telling her it is disgusting or sickening is another, imo.", "I am 45. An 18 year old is practically a baby in my eyes. I work with a bunch of early 20 year olds who I totally respect and enjoy working with but I see them firmly as the next generation.

NTA but yeah OP, sounds like your mom is just trying to get a rise out of you. Ignoring her might be the best thing.", "Yeah it sounds like there's some \"reclaiming lost youth\" kind of thing going on here.

But I will say, in my late 40s i suddenly got hit on all the time by men in their 20s, it's weird but it is a thing. Worst case scenario, she goes on a few dates with a guy who is 22, pretty quickly she will see that it isn't going anywhere and not likely to develop into anything. \n\nIf I were you, I would stop worrying about these imaginary young boyfriends. If you don't let it rile you up, the joke will stop being funny.", "It's funny how well that rule of thumb seems to work. I wouldn't say breaking it is always creepy, but anyone thinking of dating someone outside of that range should at least pause to fully consider the social and experience differences in play so that  it's not done lightly.", "You're NTA OP. I'm 40 and my daughter is 23....the thought of dating someone her age is disgusting to me (not that I would because her father and I have been happily together for nearly 25 years). It's just wrong on so many levels. It sounds like your Mom is going through a premature mid life crisis.", "Yeah I\u2019d honestly start acting (don\u2019t actually get into) a relationship with someone her age and see how fast she turns it around", "Yeah it\u2019s super fucked up. Glad to see people calling it out", "no probably not the best idea to get into an extremely unbalanced and potentially unsafe relationship just to spite your narcissistic mother", "This is what happens when you forget that people on reddit are real and not sitcom characters."]}
