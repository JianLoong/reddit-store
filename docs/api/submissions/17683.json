(Needless to say, this is an awful way to treat anyone, let alone your own daughter!)  You should probably stop taking the bait for your own sanity.", "NTA It sounds like you are more mature than your Mom.  Do you have anyone you can go to about this in your family.  Grandparents, Aunts, Uncles.  Sounds like first she had Daddy issues and now she wants to relive her missed 20s.  That should not be something for you to worry about.  She needs to grow up and raise you not compete with you.", "NTA- to my way of thinking she's being bordline abusive by repeatedly suggesting this knowing that it's deeply upsetting. I can't help but be really close to throwing the \"P\" word on her. Sounds like she stopped at 18 because it was as young as she could go where she wouldn't get in trouble, but only for that reason.

That being said, dating someone who is still in highschool is a huge no. Some say the rule is 1/2 age + 7 so for your mom 26, although really, any consenting adult is okay, but it depends where you live for how adult is described (18 in Europe, you have all adult rights, but in America no drinking until you're 21!?) If you're older, say 38, and you can't go to a bar with your SO because your authorities think they're too young....that's really disconcerting imo.\n\nNTA for telling your mom not to date someone from your school, but she's probably starting her midlife crisis and feels she's 'missed out on' her carefree 20s by having you so young. The fact she first flirted with someone who's 22 confirmed this for me.", "NTA for having your opinions, I agree with them tbh.\n\nBUUUTTTT\u2026.. she is an adult who can date who she wants (over the age of 18) , so just try and remember that when you talk to her about that.", "NTA. If she finds a boyfriend within 10 years of your age and their father is single, date their dad. Level the playing field lmao\n\nBut for real...your mom is super weird for being so adamant about wanting to date people who are just hitting legal adulthood and are still in high school or just barely past that and 20 years younger than her.\n\nLike if your mom was a dude, we'd be calling her a predator so that's something to think on.", "I mean, you're not an AH for thinking anything, but yelling at your mother over a hypothetical seems farfetched, even if you are right in that such an age difference at such a young age would be inappropriate with a potential to turn abusive. But honestly, it sounds like your mom was just joking around and you got needlessly riled up over it. \n\nAnd even if your mom was actually dating a guy nearly your age, explaining to her why it makes you uncomfortable should be done in a serious manner, not as bickering. \n\nSo ultimately I think NAH, but you're definitely overreacting.", "NTA for not liking the idea of your mother dating someone from your school.  Y T A for getting mad at a hypothetical situation.  Just let her know you don't like the idea of it and that is it.", "NTA\n\nThinking?  Sure, you're ok for thinking it's inappropriate.\n\nBut an 18 year old is an adult and can give consent.  Do ultimately there isn't anything wrong with it so long as there was no prior grooming and both adults are consenting.", "Once you get older you'll understand how your mother feels now. Let that woman be. My mom also dated guys around my age (I was over 25 by then) and it was fine. She was happy, guy was happy.

NTA", "Is there a friend whose family would take you in?", "Mrs Robinson", "Although I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a complete possibility she would be trying to \u201csteal\u201d a boyfriend of mine, I do believe that she would try to compete with me for one. I don\u2019t truly believe she would ever actually be attracted to someone that close to my age, but I think she would flirt with them to get on my nerves. She said just a couple weeks back that I was \u201cscared she was going to steal my current boyfriend from me,\u201d which was something I had never vocalized to her or anyone else for that matter. I think she was really just trying to piss me off, and it worked.", "You can't steal a bf.  They aren't property.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP, it's not your business.  YTA", "This... because if you and her are not equals, then clearly a BOY your age isn't either. If a Dad was saying this to his daughter people would be ready to drag him, your mother deserves no less.", "Ask her how she would have felt if you had tried to flirt with one of her old boyfriends. Or if she would have been comfortable if her mother had tried to flirt with her boyfriends at your age.", "Watch the movie, The Graduate, start playing Simon & Garfunkels song, Mrs Robinson and start calling her Mrs Robinson.", "It sounds like she really is into younger guys. Plenty of middle-aged men are creeps, and that can extend to women as well.", "I totally agree that it\u2019s not my business, but also on the same level, if it\u2019s none of my business why does she feel the need to tell me about it?", "NTA Your mom is being very weird and inappropriate, what kind of adult jokes about stealing an underage person's boyfriend? even weirder it's her own daughter", "Run. Run from your mother and never look back. This isn't gonna get better.", "I personally think that if a parent dates sometime less than 18 years older than their child, it's weird and gross. Like \"your partner was a child when your own child was born\" is just a gross thought to me. \n\nIf my mother had dated an 18 year old when I was 16, I would have stopped talking to her at 18. \ud83d\ude2c", "NTA, this is weird. 18 is very young and there's a massive amount of change from 18-25 for example. It however isn't legally wrong of your mother to do but I think it can definitely have a negative emotional effect on the child she is dating and it obviously makes you feel uncomfortable so your mum could be more considerate of that too.", "Correction on that title- AITA for being uncomfortable that my mom is acting like a predator? \nNTA. Run, she might target your future lovers", "Half your age plus 4 years? A 40 year old should not be dating a 24 year old. \ud83e\udd2e", "You\u2019re weird", "Lmao this is the one", "Don\u2019t listen to that person calling you TA, they\u2019re clearly out of touch with reality."]}
