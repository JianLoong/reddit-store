You already know she\u2019s taking pictures of women with out their knowledge or consent for her husband sexual gratification. If she\u2019s doing this, just think of what she could be doing to you without your knowledge. For your safety I suggest you end this friendship before something really bad happens to you. So many lines have been crossed and if worse comes to worse you could get really hurt. The husband is clearly already interested in and you and this is a clear threat to your safety. This is not okay and they clearly don\u2019t care about consent. Don\u2019t ignore the red flags!

And actually just ghost her in real life too.", "NTA. OP, my partner and I are swingers/BDSM people, and that behavior is NOT acceptable. It's bizarre that they're in that circle, yet have no concept of social cues or consent- like that's wildly NOT okay. Taking photos without consent is NEVER okay, even (or especially) in kink spaces. I would not feel safe or play with people like this, period. I'd stop talking to both of them.", "NTA. It\u2019s something at least that your husband isn\u2019t interested in a double date with your friend Katie and her husband.  btw, \u2018double date\u2019 in this context is most likely involves \u2018wife swapping\u2019 in Katie\u2019s dictionary.", "It sounds like her husband is viewing you as a bit of a mission to conquer. This woman is not your friend, she's trying to get you for him - like a game. This will not end well. I'd just tell her that she has started to make you very uncomfortable and her husband pretending to be her is a boundary that was crossed, and you can't recover from. I would tell someone at your gym what she told you about the pictures. I highly doubt that was a one-time thing she hasn't done again.", "Nta, but why are you focusing your ire on him when she seems to be just as, if not more, complicit?  Why keep her around when she obviously is overstepping your boundaries too?", "Katie and her husband are, to some degree, predatory.  They may not be serial killers but they're sexually aggressive, fairly unconcerned with consent, and don't care/get off on violating boundaries.  All your interactions with Katie you described sound like her probing your boundaries to see how strongly you enforce them, and continuing to push when they find a weakness.  Her and her husband have discovered that quality about yourself you've noted--that you're nonconfrontational, anxious, and overly concerned with not hurting people's feelings or making things awkward.  You are exactly the sort of \"prey\" they hope to find.  Whether they want to have a weird orgy, get you to join a sex cult,  or lock you in a torture dungeon, the process is pretty much the same.  They probably won't stop unless you either assert yourself or get away from them, change gyms and block their numbers.  I hope you take the comments here seriously, people who hate confrontation or upsetting people can be manipulated by assholes to go much, much further than they ever thought.  You are being preyed upon, neither of them is your friend.

Ghost her please. That is not a friend, its basically a sexual harrasser you chat to.", "Yeah she wants you to sleep with her and her husband.

Like you said, it\u2019s about consent. You feel uncomfortable about her husband, but you need to feel more uncomfortable about her because you\u2019re actually interacting with her. They enable each other. \n\nIf you decide to still go to the gym at the same time, get some headphones. If she keeps trying to confront you, you don\u2019t have to confront her back.

Your friend seems to be ill-aware of your feelings toward their out-of-the-mainstream lifestyle. Consent might not be in their vernacular.", "NTA.  I don\u2019t mind open people.  I do mind the thought of being at the gym, a place I pay to be, and having someone photograph me or parts of me to send to someone else.   It\u2019s not like I am out on the street oblivious.  It\u2019s somewhere I would be self-conscious.  Also it means they are dragging strangers into their fetishes.", "NTA - and I think you have an obligation to tell her that this situation makes you uncomfortable and that you won't be double-anything because of it.  You have to make a boundary.  And this isn't about being prudish or vanilla.  You are the way you are and they are the way they are.  You might be compatible in every other aspect of your lives but this one.  I think you have to tell her how you feel and if that ends up being a deal breaker for your friendship, well then that's just the way that goes.", "Dude... he is disgusting but your friend is no better.\n\nWhy are you keeping this predator in your life?

There is zero reason for you not to tell her.  Spare her feelings?  No, she needs a reality check.  She seems incredibly inappropriate.  The whole gym picture thing is gross as hell.  What I dont understand is why you want to continue a relationship with her.", "NTA\n\nBut it sounds like you're also uncomfortable with your \"friend\", not just her husband. The husband is a creep out right for asking his wife to do shit like snap pics of another girls ass in public for him, but the wife going along with the request should also creep you out and make you EVEN MORE uncomfortable because why wouldn't she do this in the locker room with other half naked women around?", "Straight up tell her that her kinks are NOT for you guys and to stop talking about her crap to you\u2026 you are NTA for being direct. Additionally- DO NOT GO TO THEIR HOUSE ALONE! He\u2019s liable to do something to you (by force) and she will say you initiated it! (Especially since she\u2019s already been talking to you about it- and you would be hard pressed to prove differently by law because of it, if you go there alone) Definitely stay away from them. As someone  else said, the double date invite is a springboard for pushing you into their swinging lifestyle,", "I think you should end your friendship with her as well because she\u2019s just as bad as him.

What you need to do is speak to an employee of the gym, at a different time to when Creep No.1 will be there, and briefly explain how they are making you uncomfortable, and ask for the employee's help in telling Creep No.1 (and by extension, Mr. Creep) to leave you the eff alone. Or bring your husband with you - just have some kind of backup/witness to tell Mrs Creep never to speak to you again.

Dating guys was just a \"cover\" for her.\n\nLucky for me I was at home that summer in like 1986. I woke up the next day and told my parents over coffee - yep, my parents are really cool. They replied \"Oh, she is telling you what *she* wants to be true. If you don't feel that way, then that's fine.\" Best advice EVER! I thought about it for a few days and then felt *certain* that I was heterosexual. Boy, she made my life hell for the next 2 years by telling people all sorts of nasty lies.

If someone does an uncomfortable chuckle, if they pull their lips into their mouth, if they stiffen, sharp inhale, stutter over a response after you say whatever it was, maybe they start giving short replies, maybe they slowly stop responding to you, JUST READ THE ROOM.\n\nWhy would anyone want to be my friend if I\u2019m uncomfortable to be around?\n\nThat was rhetorical, they wouldn\u2019t.\n\nDon\u2019t let people make you uncomfortable time and time again to then feel bad when you might make THEM uncomfortable with \u201cshut the FUCK UP leave me alone\u201d.\n\nMaybe they should be more self aware and less fuckin\u2019 weird.\n\nSo again, no, NTA.", "NTA\n\nLike holy shit. I've been honest with my sister that I think her husband is a total asshole and he's no where near this bad. I'm glad to read the edit and hope this means you're getting the hell away from them.", "Omg! She is just as bad as he is. Don\u2019t walk away, sprint away. NTA", "NTA RUN \nI had \u2018friends\u2019 that were dating that did this to me, they won\u2019t stop until they\u2019ve had enough fun. Leave them", "NTA... also think about this..... she was sending pics of girls butts at the gym to her hubby. They sound like swingers and seems like they go on a hunt for females/men. You also said yal met at the gym. She probably took a picture of you and her husband probably said he wanted you and that is how the friendship started.", "One of the key components of well done BDSM is respect. This couple have no respect. Drop this woman as a friend.  Tell her your safe word is NO. She needs to leave you alone.", "Honestly I think you're downplaying her role, she isn't just enabling she's actively participating. They both sound like predators to me", "Yes this, predators claim \u2018BDSM\u2019 to justify their bullshit, this is not typical of healthy BDSM culture. Real BDSM folk are hardcore into consent and this is not it.", "She is outright participating. She photographed other women without their consent!", "Yeah OP is being involved in this pair's kink without it being in any way consensual. She needs to run for the hills.", "Mostly for her husband, let\u2019s be real. He is clearly the dom in the relationship and likely their sexual games revolve around his wants, and her job is to help him get off.", "Also, SHE IS NOT YOUR FRIEND!", "I feel the same way. I love my gym and the community there (minus her). I don\u2019t want to leave it", "Wow this is perfect. I\u2019ve screenshotted it. Thank you so much!", "As I\u2019ve stated in other comments since processing all of this, she is equally as guilty and I see that now. I\u2019m disgusted by both of them.", "People like this \u201cfriend\u201d are why people say kinky folks are weird. She is ignoring basic rules of consent and shaming our community. And if your sole response to this is to go after OP for feeling that this woman\u2019s specific expression of kink in a non-consensual forum is weird, then you are part of the problem too.", "About 6 months too long", "Harsh, but I appreciate it. I am trying to grow a spine.", "She had a traumatic upbringing and home life per the stories she\u2019s told me, so she definitely has mental health issues associated with it.", "Can you switch gyms or gym schedules? Block her on everything. Wear a headset at the gym and ignore her.", "just find a new gym my god", "You've gotten a lot of great advice, I just want to send you support. People like this target you for a reason and use your politeness against you, hoping they can count on you to continue to give soft \"nos\" and they can push your boundaries instead of taking the hint like a normal person.\n\nSorry you're in this situation.", "Join a different gym.", "Reading the post all I could think about was Paul  Bernardo and Karla Homolka,  like OP needs to RUN!", "Literally thinking the same thing. This so soooo creepy.", "Yes, do that, but report her behavior to the gym, since that's where you met and seems to be home base for this relationship. If the gym won't do anything, then find another gym. Ghost this woman in every possible way.\n\nNTA, obviously!", "And I guarantee you that if OP expresses concerns about these predatory behaviors leading to stalker behavior, they will absolutely belittle and gaslight OP. People like this always go straight to DARVO.", "Have them tell her she moved to Yemen. Her forwarding address is 7 Yemen Rd, Yemen.", "Problematic thing is a lot of these people don\u2019t understand clear boundaries. At best, Katie could be manipulated into this behavior by an abusive spouse, but it\u2019s more likely that she is a willing accomplice. \n\nEven more concerning than the creep shots is the husband posing as her. IMO Nothing good can come from associating with these people. Fine line between being polite and being a pushover.", "No, not open conversation,  not friendship.  You are inviting a dialogue with this and implying you had a friendship.  This is too nice.  You are not a bit uncomfortable, you are very uncomfortable.  Be more direct.  Her communication and propositions and texts are inappropriate, it is not appreciated, taking photos of you is big invasion of your privacy, you have not consented or invited to any of this, and you don't wish to interact further.", "That sounds even more calculated. Sexism is a double edge sword. Many people use women to lull people into a false sense of security. Because women register as \"safe\" and because either consciously/subconsciously most don't consider women to be a threat.", "yeah, as the classic Da Share Zone meme goes, it sounds like it's time for you to [hit da bricks](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/002/530/511/eb3) w/r/t this \"friendship\".", "She wasn\u2019t weird in the beginning. She was cool, gave me tips on lifting and whatnot. Guess she bamboozled me", "I\u2019ve dealt with people abusing my kindness and politeness for my whole life, but this is another level I\u2019ve never navigated. Thank you though", "Kate is aware, she\u2019s an integral part of this plan. \n\nPlease don\u2019t excuse her behavior as social awkwardness.. in todays world, *everyone* knows you can\u2019t take pics like that, not to mention the rest of it.", "This can happen to anyone fyi, people pleasing or not.", "You should read The Gift of Fear by Gavin de Becker. It\u2019s an awesome book about listening to your intuition/gut when something or someone seems off, even if you can\u2019t explain why.", "Agreed - but here's the thing, OP is so much of a wet noodle that I'm wondering if she's even seriously told Katie that this is unwelcome.\n\nLike Katie's still a huge asshole, but, OP seems to be so non-confrontational that I'm wondering if she's actually said \"No you need to stop\" rather than just awkwardly laughing it off and saying \"maybe another time.\"", "OMG I hadn't even thought of that... but it seems to fit Katie and her husband's predatory patterns to a T.", "Damn, this is a helluva theory\u2026.probably true. Gym needs to kick these predators out", "That seems very possible...", "Get angry.  They are sexually harassing you and making you feel unsafe.  You didnt ask for any of this and they know you are not confrontational.  Dosnt that piss you off, them taking advantage of your nice nature and giving you all this stress?  Get pissed."]}
