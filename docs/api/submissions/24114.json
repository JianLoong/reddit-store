You already know she\u2019s taking pictures of women with out their knowledge or consent for her husband sexual gratification. If she\u2019s doing this, just think of what she could be doing to you without your knowledge. For your safety I suggest you end this friendship before something really bad happens to you. So many lines have been crossed and if worse comes to worse you could get really hurt. The husband is clearly already interested in and you and this is a clear threat to your safety.

And actually just ghost her in real life too.", "NTA. OP, my partner and I are swingers/BDSM people, and that behavior is NOT acceptable. It's bizarre that they're in that circle, yet have no concept of social cues or consent- like that's wildly NOT okay. Taking photos without consent is NEVER okay, even (or especially) in kink spaces. I would not feel safe or play with people like this, period. I'd stop talking to both of them.", "NTA. It\u2019s something at least that your husband isn\u2019t interested in a double date with your friend Katie and her husband.  btw, \u2018double date\u2019 in this context is most likely involves \u2018wife swapping\u2019 in Katie\u2019s dictionary.", "It sounds like her husband is viewing you as a bit of a mission to conquer.

I would tell someone at your gym what she told you about the pictures.

Why keep her around when she obviously is overstepping your boundaries too?", "Katie and her husband are, to some degree, predatory.  They may not be serial killers but they're sexually aggressive, fairly unconcerned with consent, and don't care/get off on violating boundaries.  All your interactions with Katie you described sound like her probing your boundaries to see how strongly you enforce them, and continuing to push when they find a weakness.  Her and her husband have discovered that quality about yourself you've noted--that you're nonconfrontational, anxious, and overly concerned with not hurting people's feelings or making things awkward.  You are exactly the sort of \"prey\" they hope to find.  Whether they want to have a weird orgy, get you to join a sex cult,  or lock you in a torture dungeon, the process is pretty much the same.  They probably won't stop unless you either assert yourself or get away from them, change gyms and block their numbers.  I hope you take the comments here seriously, people who hate confrontation or upsetting people can be manipulated by assholes to go much, much further than they ever thought.  You are being preyed upon, neither of them is your friend.

Like you said, it\u2019s about consent. You feel uncomfortable about her husband, but you need to feel more uncomfortable about her because you\u2019re actually interacting with her. They enable each other. \n\nIf you decide to still go to the gym at the same time, get some headphones. If she keeps trying to confront you, you don\u2019t have to confront her back.

It\u2019s somewhere I would be self-conscious.  Also it means they are dragging strangers into their fetishes.", "NTA - and I think you have an obligation to tell her that this situation makes you uncomfortable and that you won't be double-anything because of it.  You have to make a boundary.  And this isn't about being prudish or vanilla.  You are the way you are and they are the way they are.  You might be compatible in every other aspect of your lives but this one.

I feel sleepy...", "[deleted]", "I think some people underestimate the extent to which some women are trained and conditioned to be nonconfrontational and to make people happy. My wife has similar problems, and it has hurt her in the past.", "Girl nothing will happen when you stop being her friend. I feel we sometimes think along \u201cwhat will they think of ME \u201c the reality is \u2026 nothing will happen. you will continue to live your life . text that you\u2019re not interested and that you found her husband texting you very weird and uncomfortable. You will realise in a couple of weeks that it didn\u2019t matter  even if at the beginning you feel a bit guilty or unsure", "Hope they create some police about cellphones around the gym than. Like school but for exercising.   \n\"Lifting weight? Okay, but no cellphones.\"  \n\"Hold on. Why you using cellphones? Nope. You can see the clock here. No cellphone.\"  \n\"Come on people, gain muscles. And no, you won't need that cellphone in the future to search for calories. Focus!\"", "Yeah I\u2019m an over compensator which probably falls in line with my people pleasing personality. It\u2019s a work in progress. I\u2019m hoping me addressing this situation once and for all will empower me. All of these comments are definitely giving me the fuck it strength I needed", "I understand where they\u2019re coming from, but I appreciate your kindness. I\u2019m starting to see she picked me out for a reason, and continues to push me because of it", ">No, and these people need to stop calling you weak. \n\nWhy? Some people just need to hear the blunt reality, and it seems like OP has heard an accepted that reality, which is good. It's simply not that hard to just ignore someone.", "Wow. I am so incredibly sorry that happened to her\u2026 I will definitely be putting an end to this one way or another. Probably through text because I feel most comfortable doing it that way", "I know it's hard. Maybe try practicing in the mirror, or with your husband first: \"I have already told you no. The answer will not change, no matter how many times you ask. Please respect that, or I will have to ask you to leave me alone.\"", "*fist bumps of solidarity* \n\nThat\u2019s exactly why I actually rehearse what I\u2019m going to say because I find it hard to do. But planning and practicing really helps. \n\nI\u2019m glad everyone here is making you feel affirmed.", "And if you still don't feel up for the task. Ask your husband to call her off for you.\" Like stay away from my wife and don't talk to her from now on\". And you just go with the act, by saying I can't fight with him over this so sorry. \n\nThis will save you the trouble of talking and explaining yourself all together. \n\nThat lady and her husband will surely stay clear of you after that.", "Dude, they might be stalking you already!   \nDon't you think her husband is the type to be jealous?  \nRun, DragonEnergy, Run!!!", "Block to all heavens, even apps that you wouldn't even think of", "> Yeah I\u2019m an over compensator which probably falls in line with my people pleasing personality.\n\nMost people focus on the \"fight or flight\" responses to trauma, but there are two more: freeze, and fawn. Your reaction to ship situation is similar to fawning response. It's ok, it's a natural reaction when you want to avoid confrontation for your own protection.\n\nI'd recommend going to the gym's manager, mentioning that you are being harassed by Katie, and give as many details as you've got. She is just as much a predator as her husband is, or at the very least she is willing bait. You need some assurance that this woman will not be at this gym anymore, and given the whole \"butt photos\" debacle, I don't doubt that this gym will kick her out with just one more complaint.", "I have no idea why she wasn't booted from the gym for taking those pictures. A man doing that would have been kicked out immediately.", "That\u2019s a good idea. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m getting downvotes, I\u2019m working on standing up form myself but it\u2019s just not that easy for me. Damn", "He told me I could use him and throw him under the bus as the reason not to speak to her anymore, he doesn\u2019t care. But I hate to use others to fight my battles", "I know\u2026. It\u2019s a huge double standard.", "Don't call your husband another person. He is your husband, he has to fill up the gap where you fall short. And its not throwing under the bus in this situation, it will surely be more than fun for him. And as you have a soft personality, this is for your own benefit.\n\nDon't drag this situation for your own good, its just a gym, you'll have peace of mind, and it won't be too awkward after he had shut her down in the gym for you.", "If your not willing to fight the battle yourself then let your husband if he\u2019s offering he\u2019s your partner for a reason. One way or another the situation needs to be dealt with and soon", "You\u2019re right"]}
