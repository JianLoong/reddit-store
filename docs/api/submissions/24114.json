You already know she\u2019s taking pictures of women with out their knowledge or consent for her husband sexual gratification. If she\u2019s doing this, just think of what she could be doing to you without your knowledge. For your safety I suggest you end this friendship before something really bad happens to you. So many lines have been crossed and if worse comes to worse you could get really hurt. The husband is clearly already interested in and you and this is a clear threat to your safety.

And actually just ghost her in real life too.", "NTA. OP, my partner and I are swingers/BDSM people, and that behavior is NOT acceptable. It's bizarre that they're in that circle, yet have no concept of social cues or consent- like that's wildly NOT okay. Taking photos without consent is NEVER okay, even (or especially) in kink spaces. I would not feel safe or play with people like this, period. I'd stop talking to both of them.", "NTA. It\u2019s something at least that your husband isn\u2019t interested in a double date with your friend Katie and her husband.  btw, \u2018double date\u2019 in this context is most likely involves \u2018wife swapping\u2019 in Katie\u2019s dictionary.", "It sounds like her husband is viewing you as a bit of a mission to conquer.

Why keep her around when she obviously is overstepping your boundaries too?", "Katie and her husband are, to some degree, predatory.  They may not be serial killers but they're sexually aggressive, fairly unconcerned with consent, and don't care/get off on violating boundaries.  All your interactions with Katie you described sound like her probing your boundaries to see how strongly you enforce them, and continuing to push when they find a weakness.  Her and her husband have discovered that quality about yourself you've noted--that you're nonconfrontational, anxious, and overly concerned with not hurting people's feelings or making things awkward.  You are exactly the sort of \"prey\" they hope to find.  Whether they want to have a weird orgy, get you to join a sex cult,  or lock you in a torture dungeon, the process is pretty much the same.  They probably won't stop unless you either assert yourself or get away from them, change gyms and block their numbers.  I hope you take the comments here seriously, people who hate confrontation or upsetting people can be manipulated by assholes to go much, much further than they ever thought.  You are being preyed upon, neither of them is your friend.

Like you said, it\u2019s about consent. You feel uncomfortable about her husband, but you need to feel more uncomfortable about her because you\u2019re actually interacting with her. They enable each other. \n\nIf you decide to still go to the gym at the same time, get some headphones. If she keeps trying to confront you, you don\u2019t have to confront her back.

It\u2019s somewhere I would be self-conscious.  Also it means they are dragging strangers into their fetishes.", "NTA - and I think you have an obligation to tell her that this situation makes you uncomfortable and that you won't be double-anything because of it.  You have to make a boundary.  And this isn't about being prudish or vanilla.  You are the way you are and they are the way they are.  You might be compatible in every other aspect of your lives but this one.

Would you rather switch gyms than tell her how you feel?", "Hon, you've got to do something.  You're kind of committing to live as a victim here. TBH, find another gym. I'd never trust them again after they let her stay when she was caught red-handed taking those pics. Be careful,  but get yourself out of this!", "I will. Her \"friends'\" kink is exhibitionism for non-consenting people.  That's what she likes, and that's why she does it. She is getting off on shocking and upsetting people. I'll shame the hell out of that.", "Because she always texts/calls/talks to me at the gym and I don\u2019t know how to say stop, basically. I\u2019ve truly never been in this situation, this is new territory. But you\u2019re right", "I don\u2019t want to, I just want her to leave me alone without me telling her so. Which is obviously not going to happen", "Agreed. Him texting OP by deception and her being okay with it means they both gotta go. Hard to imagine what Katie is bringing to the table as a friend that outweighs the distress she is causing.", "We go to the same gym around the same time and I\u2019m not a confrontational person, so I don\u2019t know what to do", "I know, it sounds pathetic as do I. I\u2019m spineless. I will take all the heat I deserve. I keep hoping she will take the hint and stop I guess", "If OP is really that non confrontational, and can't deal with the issue, that would probably be best for them.\n\nChange gyms, block the number and move on", "Tomorrow go to another gym. Please. Don't tell her, and take your hubby along with you the first few times.", "Just block her!  You don't owe her anything.  Don't be a victim.", "Block her. \n\nPractice a response you feel comfortable saying to her if she talks to you in person, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I feel like our interests, areas of comfort and ethics are so different I just don\u2019t see our friendship working out. I wish you all the best but I\u2019m no longer interested in staying in touch.\u201d", "Ghost her. Change gyms and block her contact info. If you're non-confrontational, commit to not confronting her and just disappear from her life.", "Listen, there\u2019s non-confrontational, then there\u2019s being a doormat, then there\u2019s you.", "have you tried not being an absolute wet noodle of a person?", "she doesn\u2019t seem like a take the hint kind of person, sweetie", "She deliberately doesn\u2019t take a hint or even actual statements from you that you\u2019re not into it. She correctly has you pegged as someone she can dominate and she will keep hounding you until you cave, or change gyms. OR tell her fuck off. \n\nShe was OK with sending her husband pictures of people who did not consent! I can\u2019t believe she wasn\u2019t thrown out of the gym. And I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re still talking to her. Are you sure you\u2019re not enjoying this on some level? Because I can\u2019t imagine anyone putting up with this the way you are doing.", "She won't take the hint.  It's up to you.", "Hey, don't beat yourself up, it doesn't help. You can definitely message something like \"hey, I don't think I want to hang out any more\" plus/minus \"it makes me really uncomfortable how you push your sexuality onto people without consent\" - then block her, and work out at a different time. \n\nAlso, practising with friends can help! We are not encouraged to stand up for ourselves generally, it is going against the grain, and jerks try really hard to make you feel unsure you're in the right when you do.", "Go. To. A. DIFFERENT. Gym. \n\nIt sucks, it really does, but just go to a different one. Then...BLOCK HER NUMBER. Period.", "I agree", "I love how eloquently you worded that. I\u2019m going to use that! I\u2019m writing lots of these suggestions down and will send her a text message once I feel it\u2019s perfectly written. If she doesn\u2019t stop at that, I will go to the manager of the gym.", "Good lord, I can see her and her hubby eventually ending up on a \u201cdouble date\u201d with them because she doesn\u2019t have the spine to stand up for herself.", "I\u2019ve tried, and failed miserably :(", "I don\u2019t reach out to her, if she texts me I respond with one word answers. If she talks to me at the gym I reply. I\u2019m certainly not enjoying this, I\u2019m just not the type of person to confront people.", "Yeah. A lot of the time we think we NEED to explain all the specifics to people, but we really don\u2019t. If she was a super close friend, maybe I\u2019d tell her the whole truth, but she isn\u2019t. And there\u2019s likely to be no benefit to anything besides a polite thanks but no thanks\u2026", "Hey, it isn't always easy being assertive in these situations - its freaking weird as all hell. I hope the OP  finds another gym fast...without telling the weirdo stalker girl", "It's simple.  \"I'm not interested in you nor your husband.  I'm blocking you.  If you continue to bother me at the gym, I will report you\".  She already has a report against her.  Try it, you will be beyond empowered by doing this.", "She is taking advantage of your inability to do confrontation. She knows very well that you're a people pleaser and trying not to upset anyone. This is an excellent lesson in not being able to make everyone happy. You should absolutely tell her both her and her husband have made you uncomfortable, even if it's through text. You may have to switch your gym times to avoid running into her though."]}
