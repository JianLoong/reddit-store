Why would she talk about this in a work environment? \n2. The dad clearly seems uncomfortable with it, which is what makes it weird.\n3. Did she not know guests would be there?

Not necessarily bad if everyone is comfortable with it in the privacy of their home (although her dad doesn't seem that ok with it), but still weird. \n\nAnd in my family we're super chill about nudity when it comes to nudity between women - like if I'm hanging out in my mom's room when I visit and she comes out of the shower she doesn't mind getting dressed in front of me (I'm a woman as well). Same thing with my sister. It's not like any of us stare or anything. We don't hang out while nude though. So even from a person in a somewhat nudity positive family your coworker's dynamic comes out as weird. \n\nThe part that shocked me the most was not the nudity though, it was the thought of sitting bare ass naked on the family couch. Unless it has a non porous surface there is no way to properly sanitize it later. And I don't care that she's just showered, if she's a healthy average female her bits will produce juices.

That is where they can teach the correct names for different body parts.", "i 100% relate to n agree w/ everything u just said! i'm only like this w/ my mom n partner re: nudity and checking for issues, but i'd never share that info at the workplace lol", "How on earth is shitting on floor and being naked even slightly the same?? She should have been told company was around, yes. But nothing is wrong with being naked in the comfort of your own home around your family. You man are odd.", "\nSeriously, it's weird. Wax yourself and see a doctor if you've got a problem. And put some damn clothes on!!", "NTA It\u2019s not normal to ask family members to wax your crotch or check out your labia. It\u2019s not okay to go around naked in front of male relatives. Now, before anyone jumps on me for using the word \u201cnormal\u201d let me say that absolutely everything goes, I get that. There\u2019s no \u201cnormal\u201d anymore, everything is permitted if not encouraged. It\u2019s all people just being human and all things human are beautiful and cool and benign. Except that \u201ceverything is normal, there is no abnormal\u201d is not true. In any other field, there is proper/improper or appropriate/inappropriate or healthy/unhealthy. But now the fad in thinking is that in sex, it\u2019s all equal, it\u2019s all healthy. It\u2019s not. This girl thrusting her nakedness onto everyone, including her dad, is not appropriate. She\u2019s an exhibitionist. She gets a frisson of sexual pleasure from being seen nude. She wants her genitals examined or groomed. She can\u2019t be counted on to put on clothes when company comes. She\u2019s forcing her sexuality onto the unwilling and forcing her family to take part in her kink. How is this different from the sexual harassment perpetrated by exploitive men?", "Lmao yes this. I've known a couple of toddlers who went through a nudist stage and was hilarious. But that's because they were, like, two. Not 25.", ">which I don't find weird since my toddlers are almost always naked now that they've figured out how to remove their clothes\n\nMy kids did this up to age 6. They'd get home from school, shout, \"it's naked time!\" and strip. \ud83e\udd23 We never had anyone over and they grew out of it without any sort of intervention, thankfully. Also thankfully they didn't do this at other kid's houses. \ud83d\ude02", "Getting your mum to wax or check something is kinda OK\n\nBut Dad is saying \u201cffs put on clothes\u201d\n\n25 is way too old to be demanding naked attention from your parents. Weird", "Why are people wierded out by the thought of their parents waxing them? your mother changed your diaper and looked at that region for years. Even my justnomil has given me a wax before.  It's only wierd if you make it wierd.", "I don't want to, but I can't help it: you can't wax a vagina. She waxed her vulva.\n\nI'm sorry.", "Omg you can't wax a vagina thats the internal part,I'm just utterly baffled how many women don't even know what their own genitalia are called ..you wax your VULVA", "I don\u2019t know many women/teens that can\u2019t shave their own legs?", "My daughter and I lived together when she was 20-21 after her dad and I divorced. We walked around naked (not casually, but from the shower or whatever). She also once thought something was going on with her vagina and asked me to look. I didn\u2019t think it have a problem with it at all\u2026but I am a nurse and see random vaginas all the time. Didn\u2019t seem weird to see my kid\u2019s for a potential problem.", "Ah cool, thanks \ud83d\ude02", "That sounds lovely. Nothing like being naked outside.", "Pathetic response", "Lol", "When you put your asshole on my couch, it becomes the same thing", ">weird tyrants who have no boundaries\n\nOMG, that's perfect. 1000% accurate. XD", "Mine are 6 and 4, both boys. \n\nThe number of times before/after baths I've seen the nakey dance... Yeah...\n\nAnd my youngest likes to come and chat when I'm in the bath... Cos apparently I need company so the bath doesn't eat me....", "In our family the toddlers are invited to do the nudie dance (running in a circuit, kitchen to living room) after bath time.  It's the only time in their lives kids get to run around naked without feeling self-conscious.", "Memories. My boys did the Naked Ninja after bathtime.", "Not normal this woman might be stuck in a phase where she\u2019s trying to act like a toddler. It\u2019s very odd. NTA.", "I think you are looking for the word \u201cnon-consensual.\u201d", "I think (at least, in my opinion) that it's how it fits into the rest of the puzzle. She's 25, living w her parents, refuses to wear clothes when asked (even though it's *their* house), has her mom examine her genitals when there's an issue, has her mom wax her, etc.\n\nEach individual thing isn't that weird, but when you combine them all, it's weird.", "I mean, you *can* wax your vagina, it'd just fail to accomplish anything useful, be incredibly painful, and probably require a trip to the emergency room after.", "I'm just utterly baffled how you don't accept vagina as the generalized term for female genitalia. Most people know the difference but don't care to keep them separate in conversation. You know by context that OP was talking about the outside waxable area.", "Mostly common for disabled women.", "You're welcome lol", "> butthole waxes for better wiping experience \n\nUhuh.  Yeah, for a better uh WIPING experience. Totally. /s", "Professionalism aside, the \u2018weirdness\u2019 is a societal issue; there\u2019s no innate problem with it.", "This is very subjective. I\u2019m an OB/GYN and my mom and aunt don\u2019t want anyone but me examining them but my MIL feels uncomfortable with me so I always ask a friend to examine her.", "I don\u2019t think anybody is spreading their checks to go sit on your couch mate. And it isn\u2019t even your home?? They are being nudists in their own house, not yours.", "I remember my son was about 3 & I forgot to lock the door before my relaxing bubble bath. He opened it, stripped, and hopped in before I could recognize what was happening.\n\nNo relaxing was done that day. IIRC, a fair amount of water ended up outside the tub due to splashing.\n\nAnnoying at the time, but a good memory now.", "Yes! Thanx.", "Plus she says \"just don't look\" when dad tells her to wear some clothes.\n\nThat's not possible. They have to talk to her at some point. They are going to see her around the house doing stuff naked, and if they have to have a serious discussion about something at the table, she's naked.\n\nI mean if mom and dad were nudists as well, sure. But it makes them uncomfortable and no amount of trying to break down cultural restraints is going to justify this.", ">but don't care to keep them separate in conversation.\n\nAnd it's weird every time.", "Aren't there rules against treating a family member as a doctor?", "So you are okay changing in front of strangers but not your own mother? That\u2019s what\u2019s hard to grasp for me. I have no issues changing in front of my mother just like I have no issues changing in front of my (same gender) friends, sister, strangers at the gym, or the doctor.\n\nTo be honest I don\u2019t want anyone touching my genitals. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gross to ask for help from your mother.", "It\u2019s the dads couch. The dads uncomfortable with it.  It\u2019s his house, not hers. If she wants to wipe her ass on the couch, she can move out and buy a house with her own couch. And you do realize your entire ass crack is covered in shit particles right? So fucking disgusting", "He has a legit reason, he needs to pee. \n\nThen he tries getting in the bath with me...", "I enjoyed this reply thread.", "I specifically said *touching*.", "It\u2019s also her house and her mothers house. She shouldn\u2019t be naked if her her dad is uncomfortable with it, but other than that there is LITERALLY no issue. Also, fucking hell do you guys not shower?? There is shit particles everywhere. Half of y\u2019all don\u2019t don\u2019t even close the toilet lid when flushing and are complains about \u2018shit particles\u2019. \ud83d\ude44 bffr. \n\nYou guys have such weird standards on nudity oh my god. You came into this world naked. There is abolsutely no issue in being naked around those you trust as long as all parties are comfortable.", "Okay but many in the comments think it\u2019s gross that your parents see you naked after childhood. That\u2019s what I meant with my initial comment, that someone must have a terrible relationship with their mother to be disgusted by a mother seeing their daughter naked or helping her with a medical issue. Either that or this is a huge cultural difference, which you said it\u2019s not so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Lol who is \u201cyou guys\u201d", "Okay", "Obviously the people in these comments. Who else would you guys be??", "I\u2019m not talking to them. I\u2019m talking to you. That\u2019s like if I said \u201cget yalls assholes off my couch\u201d when really it\u2019s just the one person who wants to put their asshole on the couch."]}
