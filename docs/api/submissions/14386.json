Why would she talk about this in a work environment? \n2. The dad clearly seems uncomfortable with it, which is what makes it weird.\n3. Did she not know guests would be there?

Not necessarily bad if everyone is comfortable with it in the privacy of their home (although her dad doesn't seem that ok with it), but still weird. \n\nAnd in my family we're super chill about nudity when it comes to nudity between women - like if I'm hanging out in my mom's room when I visit and she comes out of the shower she doesn't mind getting dressed in front of me (I'm a woman as well). Same thing with my sister. It's not like any of us stare or anything. We don't hang out while nude though. So even from a person in a somewhat nudity positive family your coworker's dynamic comes out as weird. \n\nThe part that shocked me the most was not the nudity though, it was the thought of sitting bare ass naked on the family couch. Unless it has a non porous surface there is no way to properly sanitize it later. And I don't care that she's just showered, if she's a healthy average female her bits will produce juices.

That freaked me out way more tbh.", "NTA Also the daughter is super comfortable walking around naked but cries when someone sees her?

They\u2019re also pointing out that it\u2019s only weird when someone is uncomfortable with another\u2019s nudity and the nude person essentially tells them to get over it. That\u2019s not only weird but crosses lines of criminality. Yes, where I\u2019m from it\u2019s illegal to expose yourself to someone who doesn\u2019t want to see it.", "You can just listen without saying anything and move on to the next topic?", "Lol if you don\u2019t like my opinion scroll along", "Yeah you're right i take it back", "If it is bugging you, all you need to do is tell her. Discomfort with the way you left things could mean there was a subtle cue that she was still offended. It could also be you over-thinking things. Either way, the easy fix is just to tell her you\u2019re feeling uncomfortable with the way you left things and would like to see if she is, too.\n\nWhat usually makes people assholes is that they never even questioning how their actions or words may have affected others. Fucking up is human; how we respond is (usually) what makes us an asshole.", "Yeah when the OP said 25 I was like\u2026ummm no. Little kids generally do not know that it\u2019s not ok to do that and they are kinda weird tyrants who have no boundaries. But 25??? Girl, what?", "SAme - my daughter liked to run around after the bath yelling \"nakey girl nakey girl\" but she was like 3? Why not put a robe on? It's not the norm in any other family I know either so NTA", "Ahw this comment about your toddlers is so cute \ud83e\udd70", "I had a coworker like that. Every new hire she trained knew everything about her (including a list of her medical conditions and prescriptions) by their second day. We also know everything about her autistic brother, her family history, and her collection of Pok\u00e9mon shit.", "Tour comment went right over my head... considering the topic at hand I'm sitting here thinking:\n\n\"Upper lip? Which is that? I thought they were to the sides... oh I get it.\"", "I don't think nudity is inherently sexual but I'd sure never ask my mum to wax my foof because my vagina at the very least feels quite personal and private to me. I'd ask her HOW but her doing it for me is just - no, no thank you!", "Yeah I'm pretty surprised how many people are weirded out by that. My mum was an aesthetician for years and I'd often have her wax me when I was visiting. It was great for her when she was learning since she could train on me and I'd never complain because it was free. \n\nI agree it's weird for a coworker to bring it up unprompted in a conversation (the mum's coworkers don't need to know her daughter gets regular Brazilians) but it's just a body part. My mum always described waxing as \"just hair\" and couldn't care less about the body part in front of her. \n\nI've bathed my mum as she recovered from surgery, changed her dressings, and did her hair removal - having her wax me isn't that different.", "No? Paying a professional makes more sense, they\u2019ll probably do a better job and that\u2019s extra important with something in that region of your body.\n\nAlso, to be frank, I would much prefer a stranger to see my adult private parts rather than my parents.", "I am a guy, I thought about getting my butthole waxes for better wiping experience and ngl I rather get stranger to do that, I don't think I trust anyone in my life to help me do it", "OK, imagine your parent is an OB/GYN...would you want a pap smear from them? It's just a weird blurring of boundaries.", "I\u2019m not talking about this particular situation. I agree it\u2019s wrong to be naked in front of someone who doesn\u2019t want to see you naked. I\u2019m talking about people who are grossed out by someone asking their mother for help.\n\nAre you American by any chance? Because I think it may be a cultural difference. I live in Europe and I think everyone here is much more relaxed around nudity. For example at the gym, women get naked in front of each other, there aren\u2019t even private changing rooms so everyone sees you and you see everyone naked.", "Ironic", "If you were trying to make a point, it\u2019s completely lost on me. If you were trying to tell a joke, it was completely lost on everyone; what you said sounds less like satire and more like you unironically supporting that position.", "Do you eat in the bathroom?", "She is so easy going that it could be I\u2019m over thinking it and telling myself she\u2019s mad at me when to her it wasn\u2019t a big deal I just know I\u2019m going to be lying awake tonight worrying about if she hates me now \ud83d\ude02 I\u2019ll see her tomorrow and ask if she\u2019s okay with me, or maybe won\u2019t mention it, idk.", ">weird tyrants who have no boundaries\n\nPerfect description of toddlers \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 \n\nAdmittedly, I walk nude from my bathroom to my bedroom but, I own the freaking house and generally my kids are asleep and my husband has seen it all anyway. If we have company I wouldn't dream of it! \n\nAnd ya know, vwing a nudist is totally fine if that's what she wants to be but then she should move in to her own space.", "The father even said 'wtf' and she continues to do it. Also if I had an issue with my genitals I would probably go to the drs... Not ask a parent lol", "Loool omg same!!! I know everything about my colleague\u2019s autistic children, their grocery shopping, his wife\u2019s work schedules, his friend\u2019s cousin\u2019s pet\u2019s name etc. I literally avoid eye contact and turn my back to him but he still tells me and shows me pictures of his kids on his phone. I dare not to ask how his weekend was cos he\u2019ll just ramble on and on Ad Infinitum. The other day I was ready to see a patient and he literally stalled me for 10 mins even tho I was out the door so he could take the hint. He obviously didn\u2019t \ud83d\ude13", "LOL, sorry! Yes, can see how that can get parsed wrong!", "Yeah I totally get that. I'm a guy and I hate even being shirtless around family, let alone friends or in public. I think everyone has different personal boundaries on the matter of comfortable levels of undress and these should be respected, but I also think it's important to note (as you say) that nudity isn't inherently sexual - and to separate our own views on our own bodies and boundaries from morality and \"weirdness\".", "Mom may have worked as a waxer at some point?", "Worth a try but a portable bidet is much less painful and more hygienic overall. Harder to use if you're not at home, unfortunately", "Yup, Merican here; I love being naked, so comfy. Also, women change in front of other women as well. What\u2019s causing most people pause is not that the daughter went to her mom for help, but that it has to do with her genitals, especially the waxing part. Many don\u2019t want our parents touching our adult genitals.", "I mean I have a judgement as per the sub rules.", "Both are natural & not sexual.", "I felt it was pretty obvious. Black propaganda to undermine the other guys stance and expose how poor it is.", "Yes! Just because it's natural doesn't mean you should do it in front of others, like shitting or breastfeeding!", "If you\u2019re going to lie in bed worrying about it, you should ask yourself if that discomfort is going to be worse than the discomfort you\u2019d feel by checking in with her to see if you\u2019re \u201call good\u201d. Why suffer? \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\uddf8", "Very valid and good point!!"]}
