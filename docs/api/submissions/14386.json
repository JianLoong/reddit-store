Second because neither your coworker nor her father went and told her, \"hey we have company, make sure you put on some damn clothes.\"", "NTA. This is not appropriate for her to be talking about in a work setting at all. Great for her family if this dynamic works but after 25 years of child rearing there\u2019s no way she isn\u2019t aware that this is unorthodox and that talking about waxing her daughter at work is inappropriate? Or talking about her being nude at all? \n\nI have no sympathy for her bringing up her daughters nudity and lack of boundaries multiple times in a work setting and then being upset that you had a reaction. I would almost assume she was provoking a reaction.", "NTA, that\u2019s a perfectly natural reaction to finding out your coworker waxes her daughter\u2019s vag", "NTA but that is super weird. I feel kind of bad for the daughter for not learning that sooner but also her dad is clearly uncomfortable and she probably knew her BIL was at the house and should have chosen to dress so he Couldn't see her", "NTA.\n\nI see nothing weird about families being nude, but there are 3 huge issues.\n\n1. Why would she talk about this in a work environment? \n2. The dad clearly seems uncomfortable with it, which is what makes it weird.\n3. Did she not know guests would be there? If I was to engage in causal nudity, I would always ensure only consenting people see it. Same for if I knew a family member wanted to do so, I would warn them that someone was coming over.", "NAH. I am 25 and perfectly comfortable with my mom seeing me naked. I actually just had surgery and my mom had to help me not only bathe and get dressed but also clean my wounds so it would have been a big issue if I wasn\u2019t comfortable. I also asked my mom to help me wax once before I started lasering. I don\u2019t see the big deal.", "NTA. Your coworker obviously finds it weird too so you just reinforced the idea that it is. Or maybe she was hoping you would take the fake route and say \u201cnoooo that\u2019s not weird at all\u201d", "We were relaxed to the point of indifference when I was growing up. We walked from the shower to our bedrooms nude and never thought twice about it. I think it\u2019s a healthy attitude to have. \n\n That having been said,none of us would ever take a chance of being seen by a guest or,for that matter,just hung out in the living room nude. \n\nAs far as this goes,I\u2019ll say NTA,only because she chose to talk about this with you and you gave your honest opinion.", "your barely an asshole, you could've just not said that. Nothing worth feeling too bad about tho, maybe just a quick apology to put it under the bridge.", "NAH\nNot everyone equates nudity with sexuality. Your comment wasn't necessary,  but I could see it coming out of shock.", "Repression of nudity is learned, not innate. You were brought up with a different viewpoint on nudity, but that doesn't make either one wrong. If the comment was more as a reaction and you weren't intentionally trying to make a big deal of the perceived weirdness, NAH.\n\nI didn't grow up with my dad around, so that's a lot different than my upbringing and I can't say how that would have changed things or how I would have felt about it, but my mom and I have that kind of relationship and I will definitely ask her to look down there if needed. I came out of hers, not sure why I'd have a problem with her seeing mine.", "NTA that's weird as fuck and definitely she should have noticed that it's probably not the correct place to discuss this.", "NTA That just sounds like the daughter is an exhibitionist. Since she is 25 she should be aware that this is not normal behavior, especially if her dad tells her it's not normal.\n\nAlso \"just don't look\"? Like really?   \nI hate this shit. People that do something that makes you uncomfortable/annoys you and then just tell you to ignore it, when you ask them to stop. Absolutely no manners.\n\nIn this case it probably doesn't help the her mom is encouraging it.", "NTA. It is weird. I\u2019d just avoid saying as much to a coworker.", "NTA. It wouldn't be weird if the dad was okay with it, and if there were no kids involved.\n\n\nedit: i missed the part where the daughter was 25, i thought she was a child. Still NTA imo.", "NTA. Very strange behaviour.", "NTA, you  are right.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I mean, I'm uncomfortable with family members who kiss each other on the mouth, but I am totally aware others do it. And if they're comfortable with it, who am I to judge? I just won't do it. But when you start outwardly judging and shaming someone for living a different way than you do, that's when you become the AH.\n\nLack of modesty, lack of shame, whatever you wanna call it. She's comfortable, and her parents seem comfortable, so who cares? There are a lot of nudist families out there who have similar lifestyles and dynamics. At the end of the day, it's just a human body and we all have one. IMO, a lot of us would be better with a little less shame in that regard.", "The thing to do at that point is just shake your head, keep your opinion to yourself, and walk away. You had work to do, right?  It's not your circus.   \nESH", "NTA, that's weird AF.", "Yta. \n\nNudity is natural.  You are born naked. It's sad that so many people think that nudity is so wrong.", "NTA. If this story is actually real, that's like, super weird and I can't imagine anywhere that is normal family behavior outside of Pornhub.", "I grew up with nudist parents.  I always just told them if I was going to have a non-nudest friend over to avoid issues.  NTA", "nta it is kinda weird but maybe to them it's not. i live wit my mom at age 26 and. i walk around the house naked all the time and sometimes have my mom check out my vaginal issues too.", "NTA. Idk, Id have probably reacted the same way.", "She\u2019s throwing it out to see if you are kinky too.", "Yeah the second part especially. She told me that now every time the brother in law comes over now he yells \u2018HAVE YOU GOT CLOTHES ON?\u2019 every time he comes over now just to be on the safe side.", "This is like my manager that told me, unprompted, that her kid got sent home again for being unclean at school. Smelled so bad they sent him home. Then she laughed. And I'm like, \"why are you telling me you neglect your kid? Why is you being trash a funny story for work?\"", "I should of said that this was said on our work break in the canteen and there\u2019s not really any rules about what we can and can\u2019t discuss in that area, my work is filled with over sharers but yes it\u2019s still strange I know.", "Why are people oversharing with coworkers. I just don't understand this concept.\n\nNTA.", "Why is it so much weirder for a mom to help out with a wax than is to have it done by a complete stranger?", "Wholesome tbh", "There are no kids involved??? OP says daughter is 25", "Her parents don't seem comfortable when dad asks her to put on clothes?", "\u2018You had work to do, right?\u2019 bit rude but I\u2019ll let you off, I mentioned in another comment that I was on my lunch break so wasn\u2019t particularly rushed off our feet boss.", "Shitting is natural. Not in the living room in front of company tho.", "When I was first reading this I thought you were going to say the daughter is toddler age running around nude which I don't find weird since my toddlers are almost always naked now that they've figured out how to remove their clothes \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nBut an adult? No, that's weird. Especially getting her mother to wax her or check out any issues that are probably best left to a doctor.", "There doesn\u2019t have to be a specific rule against talking about waxing your own daughters vagina. It\u2019s probably covered in general rules about keeping work conversations somewhat appropriate, but even if it isn\u2019t, I think there\u2019s a general life rule at play here: don\u2019t talk about weird shit just to get offended when people say it\u2019s weird. \ud83d\ude02", "I mean for one thing the stranger is trained professionally to wax vaginas. \n\nI think the weirder thing isn\u2019t who\u2019s doing it but why the fuck you would bring it up during a work lunch. I would definitely find it just as weird if my coworker was telling me that their daughter gets waxed by a professional. Just not something I need to know about other peoples vaginas while eating a sandwhich.", "Oh, i must've missed that part, sorry", "Thanks for the mental image.", "Same for breastfeeding. Even at home, it should only be done in areas like the bathroom or in a locked bedroom. Just because it's natural doesn't mean it should be done in public, or in front of other people.", "Yeah you\u2019re right actually.
