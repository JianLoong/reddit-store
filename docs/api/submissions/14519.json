She is free to ask you to leave her home if she doesn\u2019t want you there.", "NTA and seems to me you should move out and go NC ASAP", "Why did you grow up and as an adult continue to live with your mum if you're dad is so amazing?", "22 is old enough to move out. You probably should. Could you could rent a flat / apartment with your brother?", "You are living in your mother's house, so she does have some say on how your treat her partner.\n\nYou aren't the AH for not liking him at all (he sounds like a total freeloader).\n\nBut you are in her home.\n\nAt 22 and 25 you can move to your own place and you will no longer have to interact with him or play nice.\n\nIf you aren't in a position to move out financially, then my feeling is that, while he's a freeloader and your mum is annoyingly happy to be a doormat, you need to respect her rules for behaviour in the house.", "NTA", "NTA Up to you whether you want to consider him part of the family or not and it sounds like he hasn't done anything to deserve that.  Your mom wants to keep the peace with him, fine.  Makes sense.  But he has to put in his half and if he isn't willing to keep his end of a contract, you aren't obligated to keep yours.", "Tough situation. Feel for your mom but you can lead a horse to water.

You do not have to interact with him.", "Your mom is the issue for putting up with it", "E S H on the basis of do either you or your brother pay rent? If not then you\u2019re also kinda freeloaders in your mothers house. You\u2019re 22 and 25, between you two you could rent somewhere if staying with your dad isn\u2019t viable. You\u2019re all not happy and you can\u2019t demand your mother leave her husband regardless of how you feel so the best option is to move out. If you\u2019re staying in someone\u2019s house, especially rent free, you\u2019ve got to try and be polite to others living there or leave, that includes him and your mum should be holding that standard to him as well. \n\nYour mum also needs to understand that you can\u2019t force people to like each other and she can\u2019t expect you to put effort in when alls he does is act like an asshole to you and your pets. I\u2019d be asking her why she allows him to treat her and everyone this way?", "ESH. \n\nHe sounds horrible but it also sounds like he's not mistreating you. You would probably feel a lot better on a day to day basis if you didn't hold on to that constant resentment. I'm not saying you need to be friends but you can actually ignore him instead of giving him the silent treatment i.e. interact politely as necessary but no more. \n\nYour focus, if you care about this relationship ending quickly, should be on building up your mom's self-esteem and talking to her with care and empathy. If you're just trying to get through life until you can move out, then focus on creating a vibe that makes you feel good at home and on maintaining some sort of relationship with your mom. If you want to be super extra and invest a lot of time trying to fix this situation, help the man find a job. Either he'll work and your home life will improve if only by his absence or he'll flake out and your mom might see that he's deliberately not working.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe him a relationship, especially given the way he treats your mother.", "Your not being rude, your not fighting, your not name calling. Your just not speaking. My grandma always said \" if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything!\" I live by this. If i don't like you im not gonna be a fake mf and pretend to like you, leading you on. I won't say a word. Ill acknowledge you exist because im not rude, but i will NOT go out of my way to have a conversation. If you have nothing nice to say to him, your good. Tell your mom you respect that he's her choice but he's not yours. You'll show respect by not being rude, but your better off saying nothing than saying what you really want to say, and causing her problems. I hope she understands, and i hope you get out soon!! Good luck with med school, you got this!!!!

The fact is, it\u2019s your moms house, not yours. She wants to live with her husband as happily as possible, regardless of whether you think he\u2019s a good guy, or share his values, or whatever. If you\u2019re going to live in her house, to a large extent it\u2019s her rules, and her rule is try to get along. \n\nHopefully soon you can move out, but in the meanwhile, say good morning, nod at him now and then, whatever passes for getting along. Btw, you realize that being nasty to him just pushes your mom more onto his side, right? If you\u2019re hoping that someday your mom wises up and realizes he\u2019s not Prince Charming, she\u2019s more likely to seek your opinion and support if you haven\u2019t alienated her now.", "You are living right now as an adult off your mother's hospitality, and given that your refusal to even be civil with her husband is causing her problems. So I do think YTA, at least until you move out. Then you can treat him however you want.", "NTA. He's consistently ignoring your boundaries, tests your mum like shit,  speaks terribly to you and thinks he's king shit? No. \n\nYou were there first.  Yes, it's your mother's house, BUT you're also too be respected. When she comes crying again I would tell her it's him or me, and if she chooses him I would extend your loan to include housing and move out.", "YTA. You\u2019re old enough to make a home for yourself instead of engaging in pettiness and misery in your mother\u2019s house. Your attitude isn\u2019t suddenly going to transform your Mom into a brand new person. Let the woman reap the consequences of her own dating decisions, and get your own damn life.", "Its your mom's husband, and you're an adult still living at home... sounds like you're being an AH... you don't have to like him, but I think you could at least be cordial like you would be with a roommate, etc...\n\nGoing with soft YTA...", "YTA-you\u2019re rude to a perfect stranger. You don\u2019t have to like him, but you still shouldn\u2019t be rude to the AHs your mother dates/marries. You\u2019ve given no indication that he\u2019s done anything to you. While I agree that he sounds like an annoying freeloader tbh-but, I hope you learn better communication skills and relationship behavior because right now, I suspect you\u2019re learning your mother\u2019s bad habits. Silent treatments are childish and you should have outgrown them by now.", "NTA but if he\u2019s your mother husband then HE IS your stepfather", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
