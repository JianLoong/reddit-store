She does have a few quirks though, like running her mouth when she shouldn\u2019t and making things weird. This trip there was a weird rise in those incidents. \n\nWhen she first met my girlfriend she made a comment about her outfit being attention grabby, it was a long sleeve floor length dress and all I could say was that it was form fitting. Idk what she was on about. Then my girlfriend was being asked questions by my siblings and dad and my stepmom jumps in and says \u201cokay, let\u2019s let someone else talk.\u201d My girlfriend got quiet and withdrew a bit. \n\nThen last night we all wanted to get in the hot tub, my girlfriend was wearing a one piece swimsuit and had been next to me the whole time. My stepmom kept literally glaring at her until she got out and went back inside.

First of all, good for you for standing up for your GF. \n\nSecond, your GF was a guest at your family\u2019s gathering. Your stepmother, insecurities or not, should have been a more gracious host and acted to make her feel welcome, not lash out at her for no reason. She is , after all, supposedly an adult. \n\nConsidering how immature she was acting, it\u2019s probably best that your SM didn\u2019t join you for breakfast and was keeping her mouth shut. As far as what you said: someone needed to say it, if only to get her to stop embarrassing your GF.", "I am 53 years old (F) with a lovely early 20s step daughter who has lovely friends. You know what I never do? Criticize them for still having their youth. I don't assume my nearly 60 partner (M) is looking at her friends' asses when we are in swim suits and I certainly don't give them shit about what they wear because I'm sad I don't look like I did when I was in my 20s. Stepmom is TA, not you, and she needs to grow up a little bit. This is clearly an insecurity problem. I'm also a proponent of appropriately nipping the problem in the bud in real time, not waiting until the issue, and relevancy, passes.", "NTA. Like you said in the post, your stepmom's insecurities are not your girlfriend's problem. She made things awkward by opening her mouth. If she didn't want to be called insecure she should have talked about it with your father/her husband in private.", "NTA, she can dish it out but she can't take it when she's being a condescending AH? she deserves it.", "NTA- Stepmom sounds like an insecure teen girl. Gross.", "NTA\n\nSM is a walking AH. She doesn't say weird stuff, she says insulting stuff. She made an insulting remark in front of everyone and should learn there are consequences for that.", "NTA\n\nThank you for standing up for your girlfriend and calling out the weird behaviour in the moment. Not enough partners do this and it makes the other person in the relationship feel awful.\n\nIt sounds like your step mom is jealous and insecure. You handled it in the correct way and she deserves to be put in her place. She was trying to be an asshole, she just angry it was called out.", "Your stepmom is kind of a sad person. Clearly jealous of a young woman who is dating her stepson. NTA", " NTA, good on you for standing up for your gf. Sometimes, people need to be checked.", "NTA\n\nLeaving it for after the trip means letting your girlfriend put up with the behaviour so NOPE to that suggestion from your siblings.\n\nAsk your dad what you should have said instead and why, if he understands why you were upset, he didn\u2019t say anything to his wife about her inappropriate comments. What she said was gross about him, too.", "NTA and you may need to repeat it until she gets it. She's old enough to know better, so she has no excuse for her behavior.", "NTA. She is insecure and taking it out on your girlfriend. You were right to defend your GF. And everyone else in the obviously agrees.", "NTA - step mom needs to grow up. really seems like a dick measuring contest that your gf didnt sign up for", "NTA - if you left it for after the trip, there would be a good chance that you GF wouldn't want to meet up with your step-mom anymore.  There would also be the chance that your step mom would have said something that she couldn't come back from.  It needed to be addressed and kudos to you for sticking up for your GF.", "NTA... but the correct word is jealous. Your girlfriend is young and probably very nice to look at. That is hard for some older ladies to deal with. If she is nearing 50 she is probably getting near the change and I can tell you that does bad things to some women. I think stepmom has some issues that she should be talking to a Dr. about.  I feel bad for your girlfriend.", ">that I didn\u2019t need to call my stepmom insecure\n\nYou called a spade, a spade. And your stepmom has made your innocent girlfriend profoundly uncomfortable multiple times. \n\nIf your stepmom doesn't like how she's (the stepmom) is being made to feel, then she should think about how she's made her guest feel. Because your stepmom has been rude as fuck. \n\nIf you and girlfriend end up being permanent, stepmom has poisoned this relationship. Girlfriend is probably never going to like or be comfortable around her. If the two of you have kid, stepmom should realize that if girlfriend doesn't want her playing grandmother it's because of how stepmom behaved and stepmom has no one else to blame.\n\nNTA", "I am going to go with NTA - she made your girlfriend uncomfortable, and you came to her defense, you are a good BF. I do think you were a little harsh with your Step Mom. Moms can be protective, they don\u2019t mean anything by it just looking out for you they think. It may not be she is insecure, but that she is judgmental on how your GF is perceived and how that reflects on you. Us dads can be the same way with the guys our daughters bring home.\n\nINFO- is this the first GF you have brought home to meet the family? At your age I would assume no, but the vibe may be different if it\u2019s serious? Has she ever been this way with other girls you have known?", "INFO.  Did you deliver this verdict to your stepmother privately or in front of others?", "ESH. Why couldn\u2019t you pull her aside and ask her to stop making your gf uncomfortable with her comments? She shouldn\u2019t have made the comments but you are also an adult and need to learn how to manage conflict productively.", "[deleted]", "INFO:\n\nSince it sounds like you responded to your stepmom publicly, I have to ask. Your stepmom's \"what's her problem...\" comment - was that said in the hearing of you and your father only, or was it said in the hearing of other family members? And importantly, was your girlfriend in hearing range when it was said?\n\nAnd before your stepmom met your girlfriend, what did you tell your stepmom about her? Did you ever suggest your girlfriend is shy, socially anxious, etc? Did your stepmom have *any* justification to think that your girlfriend might possibly have been overwhelmed with the attention?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You've described her as shy and quiet, then your girlfriend turns up in a form-fitting floor-length dress. Well, since you've not mentioned how you and your family were dressed (and I didn't ask earlier), it is unclear if you and/or your family were formally, whether the way she was dressed was in-keeping with everyone else or seemed OTT.\n\nYour stepmom's comments about her looks and swimsuit were rude and icky, yes, and it was appropriate that you said something there and then to defend your girlfriend, but I think it is worth acknowledging that part of the reason your girlfriend was made to feel uncomfortable from the first meeting appears to have an attempt by your stepmom to not leave her feeling overwhelmed which backfired.", "Pet peeve of mine lol sorry nothing personal", "To other girlfriends, yes but I was a shitty teenager back then and didn\u2019t really pick up on it.", "Well, the stepmother did all the projection publicly,so...", "It's his relationship with his relative.
