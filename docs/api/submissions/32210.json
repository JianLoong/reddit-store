She is afraid to drive due to an accident when she was in her early 20s. So she doesn't have a car. She's a single mom and we live in the same rural apartment complex. Since we live in a small town without public transportation, and the nearest town with grocery stores, doctors, etc. is 16 miles away, she depends on others to get where she needs to go. Her insurance pays for transportation to medical appointments but everything else, well, she relies on other people. \nI have a car and live two doors down. We are both on disability and both supporting one child, both make the same amount of money a month. But she asks me for rides so often! At least once a week. To go grocery shopping, ER visit (twice in two days),tattoo appointment (last week), pharmacy, etc. And she really doesn't respect my car. Not disposing of cigarette butts properly, moving seats without asking, constantly talking on the phone while I am trying to stay calm by listening to music or while I am taking her through a fast food drive through. That's just a few things.\nHere's my issue, with my disability, I am extremely introverted. I have PTSD and use music to ground myself.. I do not like people in general and she knows this. She knows I have severe social anxiety. \nLately, I feel like she is taking advantage of my kindness and using me as a taxi. So I've decided to set boundaries and tell her no when I don't feel like going anywhere. Now she says I'm mad at her and doesn't understand why. I'm not mad, irritated at the lack of basic respect, but not angry. She does give me gas money, but not much, considering prices and that the shortest distance I have to drive her anywhere is 16 miles. Am I the asshole for telling her no because I don't want to go anywhere? I am still willing to drive her in emergencies.\nEdit- Moving the seat without permission is an issue because my car is a former police car. It has no center console. The front seats are against a divider that keeps my German Shepherd from jumping in the front. When the seat is laid back, it twists the divider and creates a hole he can push through. My neighbor knows this, I've told her several times. But she didn't listen or didn't care.", "created_utc": 1701548933, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/189cd8l/aita_for_telling_my_neighbor_i_dont_want_to_give/", "score": 431, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she refuses to drive then ideally she needs to move to a place with more accessible transportation options or near family or something. You are not obligated to drive her around. And if you do, it should be for necessities (not tattoos, etc.) and you should tell her your car rules ahead of time. For example, why do you let her smoke in your car? That's so disgusting of her to do. \n\nIf it were me and I didn't want to cut her off completely (which you are well within your rights to do) I would have set days/times to drive her places and tell her anything else requires her to ask at least 24-hours prior. Like you could say that you'll take her to the grocery store once a week at 10 am on Tuesday or whatever. I would reiterate that you need calming music while you drive for your own mental health and if she can't be quiet/not talk on the phone then you won't drive her. If she makes a call while you're driving, I would pull over and make her get out or refuse to drive further until she stops.
