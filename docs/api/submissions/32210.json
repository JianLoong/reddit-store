She is afraid to drive due to an accident when she was in her early 20s. So she doesn't have a car. She's a single mom and we live in the same rural apartment complex. Since we live in a small town without public transportation, and the nearest town with grocery stores, doctors, etc. is 16 miles away, she depends on others to get where she needs to go. Her insurance pays for transportation to medical appointments but everything else, well, she relies on other people. \nI have a car and live two doors down. We are both on disability and both supporting one child, both make the same amount of money a month. But she asks me for rides so often! At least once a week. To go grocery shopping, ER visit (twice in two days),tattoo appointment (last week), pharmacy, etc. And she really doesn't respect my car. Not disposing of cigarette butts properly, moving seats without asking, constantly talking on the phone while I am trying to stay calm by listening to music or while I am taking her through a fast food drive through. That's just a few things.\nHere's my issue, with my disability, I am extremely introverted. I have PTSD and use music to ground myself.. I do not like people in general and she knows this. She knows I have severe social anxiety. \nLately, I feel like she is taking advantage of my kindness and using me as a taxi. So I've decided to set boundaries and tell her no when I don't feel like going anywhere. Now she says I'm mad at her and doesn't understand why. I'm not mad, irritated at the lack of basic respect, but not angry. She does give me gas money, but not much, considering prices and that the shortest distance I have to drive her anywhere is 16 miles. Am I the asshole for telling her no because I don't want to go anywhere? I am still willing to drive her in emergencies.\nEdit- Moving the seat without permission is an issue because my car is a former police car. It has no center console. The front seats are against a divider that keeps my German Shepherd from jumping in the front. When the seat is laid back, it twists the divider and creates a hole he can push through. My neighbor knows this, I've told her several times. But she didn't listen or didn't care.", "created_utc": 1701548933, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/189cd8l/aita_for_telling_my_neighbor_i_dont_want_to_give/", "score": 170, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she refuses to drive then ideally she needs to move to a place with more accessible transportation options or near family or something. You are not obligated to drive her around. And if you do, it should be for necessities (not tattoos, etc.) and you should tell her your car rules ahead of time. For example, why do you let her smoke in your car? That's so disgusting of her to do. \n\nIf it were me and I didn't want to cut her off completely (which you are well within your rights to do) I would have set days/times to drive her places and tell her anything else requires her to ask at least 24-hours prior. Like you could say that you'll take her to the grocery store once a week at 10 am on Tuesday or whatever. I would reiterate that you need calming music while you drive for your own mental health and if she can't be quiet/not talk on the phone then you won't drive her. If she makes a call while you're driving, I would pull over and make her get out or refuse to drive further until she stops.

I have it there so I don't have to take my eyes off the road to put a cigarette out. But she just mashes hers out and it blocks the hole in the top.", "I should have clarified, the seat is up against the divider that keeps my German Shepherd from jumping into the front seat. My car is a former police car, so it doesn't have a center console. Moving the seat creates a hole he can push through.", "You raise a good point. To answer your questions, yes, she knows all these things. I've spoken to her about this several times.", "I forgot to clarify that point. My car is a former police car so it doesn't have a center console. The front seats are up against a divider that keeps my large dog from jumping up front. When the seat gets laid back, it twists the divider, which creates a hole he can push through. She knows this. I've told her several times.", "I\u2019d agree, but OP says there is no public transportation.", "Anytime you\u2019re setting a boundary, say no and NEVER give a reason. Just no. Took me too long to learn this.\n\nWithout a reason, there\u2019s nothing for them to guilt or argue against.", "I think it could be worth it to sit down with her and say you can take her out shopping 1x/every other week, and it needs to be a set day/time. Set some rules with her like no smoking in the car, no phone calls in the car, and she should pay you for your time. You're basically her PCA.. charge her whatever minimum wage is... especially if it's a special trip just for her needs.\n\nOr something like, \"i'm goung to go shopping/run errands monday at 10am. Want to come with me?\" And then stress this is the only time you are offering for another 2 weeks or whatever, you have decided.", "Great point about therapy - I did hypnosis to get over my anxiety about driving after a terrible accident.", "I live in rural area and we even have them here. You might be surprised.", "That's very kind of you.", "From now on, always answer, \u201dyes, I\u2019m quite busy. I can\u2019t manage that.\u201d Busy doing what, day dreaming, taking a bath, counting peanuts, it really doesn\u2019t matter. You don\u2019t need to say anything beyond that.", "Yea that isn't fair. If she needs the lift then she needs to be more organised and join you on your trips not ask for more.", "You're welcome. Definitely don't let her guilt you, I know it is hard but you aren't being an AH by setting boundaries. You could always offer to take her places if you are already going. She could tag along if you go groceries as an example. But even then, you can set up boundaries about her respecting your quiet time and not moving the seat etc.", "Ricky. This shit needs to stay in the trailer park.", "In that case I would also not be giving her rides any longer.", "Exactly. Giving a reason makes people think that there is a solvable problem.", "Folks have tried driving for Uber where I live, but requests are so few they never stick around or maybe uber drops them from service or something. My town has a population of 17k+/-. Surrounding towns in my county definitely don't as we are the biggest town in our area. I think you have to go about half hour from our town to find uber/lyft drivers.\n\nWe do have busses and a taxi company. And the bus company does have an on demand door to door service if needed.", "I wouldn\u2019t say that you\u2019re reformed at all", "Where I live, there aren't many Uber or Lyft drivers willing to come this far out. My town has a population of about 600, with the county population around 14,000. Very rural community.", "I used to be worse\u2026", "Work it out with a therapist then, not by punching down toward someone who is already struggling", "Thank you for your kindness. It is very much appreciated."]}
