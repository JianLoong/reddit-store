We were in a serious and committed relationship and had been together for a couple of years at that point, but we were not at the point of having children or getting married. We hadn't even discussed it. We were both careful when it came to contraception, however during our relationship, I fell pregnant. My boyfriend was very upset, even angry. He expressed that he'd like me to end the pregnancy. I was also scared, and I absolutely took his feelings into consideration, but I also knew I didn't want to terminate my pregnancy.\n\nI told him that I was going to keep our child, but that he didn't have to be involved in any way if he didn't want to be. He said he didn't and asked me to move out (he gave me time to do this, he didn't throw me out). I decided to move back to my country, so I could be with my family. I told him this and he agreed and said it was for the best.\n\nI gave birth to my son almost a year ago. My ex-boyfriend found out about the birth through mutual friends (he wasn't involved in the pregnancy at all), and got in touch with me to ask if he could come and see our son. I obviously said yes, and he came to visit. I think seeing our son changed his view completely, and he started visiting at least once a fortnight, often staying for much longer, and has since confessed to me that he wishes he'd handled things differently. He's on the birth certificate now (he initially asked not to be included), and he's asked me if I'd consider moving back to his country so we can raise our son together. \n\nGiven that I have a healthy support network around me and because of the way in which he handled the pregnancy, I've told him that I'm not willing to do that. I've asked him to consider moving to my country, but I appreciate that it is much harder for him to move than for me to move due to his job (I'm a freelancer, so I can work from anywhere, whereas he works in a very specific technical role that pays very well, but that there aren't a lot of opportunities for).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1667583663, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym59hv/aita_for_refusing_to_move_back_to_my_exboyfriends/", "score": 317, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why should you move away from your support system to a place where you don\u2019t have one\u2014as you said.  He can move or he can keep visiting.

He can figure his out for himself.", "NTA. \n\nBe very careful. Investigate the legalities of international parental abduction that would exist between your country and the father of your child's. \n\nIt \\_might\\_ be possible that your BF has learned and grown from this experience.

If he really wants to be involved he can move and find more work.", "NTA  \n\n\nhe esentially abandoned you you cannot trust it to be a one time thing", "NTA. These are the exact considerations you need to be factoring in. You have a support system where you are; there, you have him (literally the least supportive track record). If he wants involvement, he can make it work somehow. You stay where you are safe and supported.", "NTA what is in this for you? You did all this alone so far without him, his poor choices do mean you should give up your support network. I would be loath to comply with this request when he could decide again that it is too much effort.", "NTA \n\nPLEASE BE CAREFUL\n\nHe wants you to move back to his country and you\u2019ve said no. You\u2019ve also now put him on the birth certificate which can give him certain rights (not sure what countries you\u2019re in).\n\nI don\u2019t want to go off the deep end to worst case scenario, but one parent kidnapping a child and taking them away to another country is a real thing.\n\nDon\u2019t let him take your child anywhere alone.\n\nHe\u2019s already thrown you both away once in anger when he didn\u2019t want you. What\u2019s to say he won\u2019t, again in anger, take his child home to his country??", "NTA You can live in separate countries and still co-parent. Don\u2019t move for the convenience of a man who has no commitment to you and, imho, behaved poorly towards you when you were pregnant with his child. Stay where you have a support network and he can visit.", "INFO: Why did you bring this man back into your life after he basically just threw you away?", "NTA. He screwed this up. Now he wants to fix it, which is fine, but it's not reasonable to expect you to move away from all your support. Maybe he can just visit for weekends for a year and see how things go.", "NTA\n\nIn the future, if he continues to show support and interest, it might be something to consider, but I'd want a consistent track record of his wanting to actually parent before I left my entire support network and moved back to a country for someone who had ended a relationship with me and refused initially to be involved in my child's life. And by consistent track record, I mean give it a few years and be good and sure the novelty of having a baby has worn off.\n\nEdit: I'd also remember that all of his interactions with your son have basically been vacations for him. Coparenting is about getting up in the middle of the night when your eight-year-old has just puked in his bed and down the hall, when you have to get up for work in the morning. It isn't going on vacation to another country for a few weeks a year to see your baby that you can simply hand back when you're done.", "NTA.  If he wants to help raise your son, then he can be the one to move since his actions in the past have shown he'll abandon someone he supposedly loves when issues arise.", "NTA\n\n>Given that I have a healthy support network around me and because of the way in which he handled the pregnancy, I've told him that I'm not willing to do that.\n\nAlso, he hasn't made any actual commitment to you or your son e.g. you aren't married.  He could lose interest and leave you without the support network you have at home.\n\nIf he got married to someone else, he might even try to gain custody of your son - and being in his country might put you at a disadvantage.\n\nThis may all be very inconvenient for your ex but the situation is the result of his own actions/behaviour.", "NTA. I would never, ever consider moving back. You could end up stuck there. Stay where you are. He screwed up. If he wants to make things better, he can move to where you are and work on the coparenting relationship and his relationship with you.", "NTA\n\nIt would be bad enough if he were asking you to move to the other side of the same country. Then you'd just be losing your support system.\n\nHe's asking you to move to a different country where (I presume) he's the citizen and you are not. You'll have no recourse and no one to go to bat for you if something goes wrong. He's not married to you and you'd have little to no legal protection compared to him. \n\nWithout several years of commitment and dating you again on his part, a wedding ring on your finger, AND legal documents that establish who will have primary custody of the child if this relationship goes (signed off on by lawyers in both countries as binding) I wouldn't ever take your child into his country again until they are an adult. \n\nHe might be a great dad now, but you're talking about what could become international custody issues if you make the wrong decision here. He cannot be allowed to even see your child unless you're in your home country. Not unless he rebuilds enough trust with you that you're willing to actually marry him AND fully join finances. If you haven't hit that level of trust AND actually done those things? Your child doesn't leave the country.", "nta, he had his chance.", "NTA You and your son are where you need to be.\n\nInfo: does he want a romantic relationship with you again along with raising your child together or does he want to coparent and have you live closer? \nIf he wants a relationship, do you?", "NTA why do you have to move for him? He can move for his daughter if it means that much to him.", "NTA.  Never give up your support system in the hopes that he turns out to be a permanent figure in your and your son's life.  If he truly wants to be in his son's life, he will move to where you live.  Let him make the sacrifice of changing countries, jobs, friends, family, like he expected you to do originally, which you did.", "NTA. Look at this way. He broke your heart and told you to leave. Waited a over year to be involved in one of the hardest processes of being a mom. The pregnancy stage. I would say broke your trust too. You have a stable network where you're at and you take more risk then him of being left out in the cold if decided to leave you again. Then what will you do to support you and your kid. Move back again and have him try it a second time. Nope. If you do go with him you better get some hard contract or agreeance to what happens moving forward.", "NTA. I would also research the legalities if you did move there & something happened with him again. Could he prevent you from moving back home? Custody laws are complicated & sometimes really unfair. Be aware of the risks before you ever even consider it in the future.", "NTA. If he can find a way to make the situation better for you, that's one thing, but as it stands now you shouldn't move if you'll lose out on support.", "NTA\n\nAt this point you have to think of yourself and your child first regardless of your feelings for your ex.  You are the parent, you fought for the life of your child, and even if he didn't automatically kick you out, he still did kick you out.  I think he's past actions are not to be forgotten because it gives you an idea of how he might react in the futur when you have life changing disagreements and with a cold those are bound to happen.\n\nI speak from experience and I was married when I decided to leave my husband's country to go back to my own, where my support system was.  A lot of people called me a lot of choice names but in the end I did what was best for me and my child and I will never regret it!", "NTA. You have your support system in place. I'm also thinking by you moving there ,you'll be isolated from that and he might perhaps take your son away from you. I hope I'm over reaching but that thought just lingers in my mind.", "If he is willing to move back that's a huge sign of commitment and would be a real sign that maybe this guy deserves a second chance. If not screw him he doesn't get to abandon you and your son and then make demands. NTA", "NTA he was the one who decided to end the relationship, so he must be the one to make sacrifices to be included again.\n\nYou\u2019re not being vindictive.  You\u2019ve got the safety and support of a baby to consider.\n\nEven married couples often move back to the mother\u2019s country when she gives birth because she needs support.", "Absolutely NTA! The only reason I could think of to entertain the thought is if it would be substantially better for the kid to be over there. Like if he had a lot of cousins/aunts/uncles or more financial support to give him a better life or better schools, etc. If the living situations would be similar though, I wouldn't even entertain it. You moved for him once and he turned his back on you. While I can appreciate his involvment now, it's his turn to make things work. Do not leave your support system for him again. (Unless it's in the absolute better interest of the kid)", "NTA\n\nPlease do not move to his country.  At some point, I believe he is going to try for custody and you will need \u201chome court advantage.\u201d \n\nPlease consult with an attorney or social worker regarding how to best protect yourself and your son. \n\nIn my cold black little heart, I\u2019m wondering if he would have reacted the same way to having a daughter. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA. His career limitations may mean that he takes a financial hit if he moves to your country, but if his son is truly important to him, he'll do it. You know what I don't see in your post? Any understanding from him on how cruel he was to you. Yes, he wishes he had done things differently. But he's still thinking of himself, not you.

Maybe this is something for you guys to work toward\u2014-but he created this situation.  You found a positive supportive place for you and your son, and he doesn\u2019t  get to just change his mind and have everything be his way.  I get that he wants more time with his son, and he can make that happen.  He just doesn\u2019t like what he would need to do it.  Again, he created this situation, and these are the consequences.  What he wants is not paramount.  What will be best for your child is.

You have no guarantee how long he\u2019s going to hang around, and then you\u2019d be stuck in another country and possibly not allowed to leave based on that country\u2019s child custody laws.  And that\u2019s a huge thing to think about.", "You are male right? I mean, you are a 1950's male right? Cos if you weren't, you would understand the importance of 'support network' to most mothers especially ones with partners that aren't exactly reliable.", "That doesn't mean dad can't move. It just means it would be harder for him to find work in his field. If OP moves she has to rebuild her entire support network. He was the one that didn't want to parent so he is the one who needs to make the sacrifice now that he changed his mind.", "But he has to do so in the country she lives in now, and not his home country. Most countries don't voluntarily deport their citizens (especially to separate a child from their mother), so she is in a much stronger position than he is with regards to custody. \n\nDepending on the countries involved, it could be a complete non-starter legally.", "I was answering the question that was asked, about why OP would move. Take your misandry elsewhere please, bigot.", "If you think a question was actually asked by u/TheShineyGlitter, I recommend you look up the term \"rhetorical question.\" Improving your reading comprehension might keep you from embarrassing yourself. \n\nCalling you out for insincerity is neither misandry nor bigotry."]}
