You don\u2019t owe some strange child shit. As long as you didn\u2019t trample said child to get the puck you\u2019re all clear", "I'm a huge sports fan you did the right thing NTA you've waited 25 years for your moment and one you may never get again passing it on to your son is something you can both cherish.", "absolutely NTA", "You are not an asshole. At all. Please don't feel guilty for this. Don't torture yourself.", "NTA\n\nWent to every home play off game for the Sens in 2017. We were all about 21-22z \nA friend knew one the equipment staff. After a game, the guy gave our buddy a karlsson stick. A CTC staff member tried to shame our friend into to giving it to a kid and our friend simply replied \u201cbut I\u2019m a kid\u201d and walked away. \n\nOnly time I\u2019ve gotten a puck, was when I was at a Kingston Frontenacs game against the Ottawa 67s and it flew over the glass and hit me in the head. Sooo", "Ah good old Long Island, the home land of the asshole (born and raised here). NTA", "NTA. It's up to you to decide", "NTA. I agree with one of the other commenters that as long as you didn't interfere with the kid trying to catch it, then the puck is yours. \n\nI had a similar experience at a baseball game a few years ago. I caught a foul ball with my kid strapped to me in a carrier, he was about 6 months old. Fans around me told me I should give the ball to the kid who had tried to run down every foul on the concourse. I said no, this is my son's first game and I'm keeping this to commemorate it for him. I left after the 6th because of people chirping.", "It depends on how it went down.  Did it come right to you?  Then N T A.  Did you scramble to grab it, out of his area when he was reaching for it?  The Y T A.  I've had adults snatch a puck from my kids feet.  We've all seen it happen.  Those people are absolute A Hs.", "Even IF it were just for you and not your kid you're not the asshole. Like you said, you've been going to games for years. You're just as much a fan as anyone else and age has absofuckinglutely nothing to do with it. YOU caught it. Fuck that kid.", "NTA. If the kid was in one of the 8 seats surrounding you, this might be a more difficult decision. But the kid was more than a row away, who are they kidding? Happy to hear your kid was stoked to get the puck!", "A few rows back?? No, you\u2019re not TA. Sitting beside you sure, but a few rows back - you\u2019re good.", "A lady once told me I should give her a baseball because it hit her first. Your puck do what u choose.", "NTA. Screw those guys. Long Island, am I right?", "NTA. You were selected by our Lord and Savior RNGesus. Let those the good Lord deigned not to be shown his grace weep and gnash their teeth.", "What a bunch of puckheads. NTA", "Sounds like it may have just gone over the glass during play, so you're totally fine .", "You puckish bastard", "I didn\u2019t grow up in the states so I never experienced this getting things at a sports event just because you\u2019re a kid thing. When I went to a baseball game a few years ago, I caught my first ball. I was very excited, but got pressured into giving the ball to a kid :( \n  \nMy friend who went with me also caught a ball later on but he stood his ground. I was kinda envious that he didn\u2019t care what other people think.", "It's another one of the ways in which kids these days are taught they don't need to earn anything. And then we wonder why they grow into entitled AHs.", "-Michael Scott", "Laughing at the image of the stick flying up into the crowd and OP catching it now", "Tbf I don't get to many hockey games but I've been to a ton of baseball games where an adult has caught the foul ball and kept it. Maybe if the kid was right next to him and was trying to catch the puck I could see switching to NAH. But that wasn't the case.", "I've been to hundreds of hockey games, some people give the pucks to the closest kid some don't. I've never seen *anyone* get yelled at for their decision.", "Maybe the Pens should've been a better hockey team this year.", "[removed]", " \nThere's nothing wrong with bringing your own kid a souvenir", "Hey guys, stop puckering around!", "its called moral coercion", "I don't think it's that. I've seen stuff like this before - a \"give everything to the kid\" attitude.", "Ohhhhh thx", "Thanks. You might want to read the second half of my comment.", "I never thought Bill Barr was a very good comedian, didn't like him much as Attorney General either.", "This \"shaming\" happens all the times these days. Doesn't matter if it's hockey, baseball,  etc.", "They also sell them at the team store", "You're right all east coast hockey teams are garbage.", "Wow. Did they throw another ball to the kid???", "What the puck is wrong with those pucking people asking for the pucking puck?? Pucking rude. Nevermind, don't give a puck about them!", "Sorry if I catch the puck or ball I'm keeping it. Fuck people who think kids are entitled to it.", "This attitude annoys and confuses me. \"Something brings joy? Give it to a kid!\" How about no.", "If it's the same incident I'm thinking of, the kid was given a ball and a shirt later in the game.", "I'm glad your son loved the puck and I am sorry that those people were so rude.", "LOL! I needed the laughs!", "Also the other kid got to experience the game from good seats if they are close enough to catch a puck. So they aren\u2019t missing out."]}
