By doing the hard thing, you're doing the compassionate thing in the long term. He still may never change, but even if he doesn't, you've made sure a theft is reported and the status of your Nan's medication is safe - i.e. doctors can't say she can't have any as it's been requested too soon. You've done the right thing by everyone involved here, I promise you. \n\nAs a small aside, I'm sorry about your Nan. It's a good few years since I lost mine now and I still remember this period of waiting you're experiencing now. It's tough. Please give yourself a break, life is tough right now and you're still out there doing your best.", "NTA. You're reporting stolen oxycodone. That's a perfectly good thing to do. Plus, if your nan needs more oxycodone, she may need to file a police report before getting more anyway (depending where you're from)\n\nOxycodone going missing is a big deal. If you're mom's on oxy, she needs it. Tell your family you're concerned for your nan, and filed a report to make sure she gets the meds she needs to pass comfortably", "NTA. He needs a wake-up call, probably a stronger one than just a visit from the police frankly.", "NTA!\n\nThere's to factors here, the first being your Nans well being. Without her medication, her comfort in her final days will be diminished and the doctors may be reluctant to represcribe.\n\nThe second is how his behaviour is effecting himself and everyone else.\nIf he has to get in serious trouble to realise harassment and the theft of drugs from a dying person is unacceptable then so it must be done.\n\nSorry about your Nan and I hope you don't let guilt distract you from the grief you must be feeling.\nHe's not worth the time", "NTA, but have Narcan handy. Getting the police involved was the right thing to do, given that amount of oxycodone could be lethal to the wrong person. And use the safe from now on.

Your parents have utterly failed your brother, you, and your grandmother. Your brother has an addiction that took over his life, is hurting his family, and could have already permanently damaged him. Oxycodone is an opioid. I googled long term consequences of opioid addiction. One of the first posts said the following:\n\nBrain injury professionals affiliated with the Academy of Certified Brain Injury Specialists (ACBIS) have reported an unprecedented uptick in the number of people they serve who have suffered a brain injury due to substance abuse, in particular, opioid dependence. This dovetails with the significant increase in opioid-related morbidity and mortality rates reported across public health agencies. In recent years, there has been a great deal of attention placed on the opioid crisis with reports of overdoses and the mounting death toll, but there has been little attention focused on the brain injuries that result from persistent opioid use.\n\nAnd another one:\n\nWhat are long-term problems from opioids?\n\nStudies show that long-term opioid treatment increases the risk of fractures, infections, cardiovascular complications, sleep-disordered breathing, bowel dysfunction, overdose, and mortality. Opioids may potentially affect cancer development.\n\nSo, because your parents did report your brother and get him the help he needed, he potentially could have brain damage or other permanent effects from long term opioid abuse. \n\nOnly a doctor could determine the exact issue and treatment and your brother doesn't look likely to go on his own. But, your but could currently have an unseen issue in his brain that's effecting him. \n\nOne of your parents is Grandma's child. They're letting your brother get away with abusing their mother. Would you report it if it was your parent?\n\nYour brother didn't just steal Oxycodone. He tried robbing his own Grandmother of the medication that was easing her pain as she was dying. Imagine if she passed and didn't have them. The medication could make the difference between dying with the cognitive ability to say goodbye or not being able to.\n\nTry reframing it. Imagine seeing it on the news.\n\nGuy A stole the pain medication from his dying Grandma and the family allowed it. Grandma's very own son excused the grandchild! More at 6.\n\nYour family has extremely skewed views if they just dismissed the lifelong health of your brother and how painful an elderly person's passing can be.\n\nLet's try reframing this. Imagine yourself as a father with two  adult sons. One of them comes to you and tells you that their brother has an almost lifelong opioid addiction. What would your first thought be? Would you be willing for your son to face clear consequences of his actions if that was what finally made him get help?\n\nYour reporting means more then your family. It means your Grandma passing peacefully and your brother being kept from following soon after. If he gets in trouble, he could be legally barred from the drug and be forced into treatment and rehab.", "Imo, the parents are more guilty than the son. How could one of them allow their mother to be in pain as she's slowly dying? More importantly, what parent allows their child to have an opioid addiction?\n\nAddictions ruin lives. An opioid addiction is even worse. The brother has had no reason to stop because he hasn't faced a consequence.The brother could've been so much more if he had gotten treatment. He could have been a person who achieved what they wanted to be instead of what an addiction told them to be.\n\nThe brothers future has been spent like currency. Opioid addictions can have long term damage and be deadly. It can damage the brain. The brother could jump to a dangerous alternative if he can't get Oxycodone and isn't given the help he needs. He could already have unseen damage.\n\nWhat kind of parent allows all of this?", "Death is not the worst thing and those that think it is haven't seen the suffering sickness can bring.  It's not bad for wishing for a family member to be able to stop hurting, and for your family to be able to move out of the horrible suspended animation of the end stages of something terminal.\n\nWhen my gran was very sick we had to talk to the doctors about taking her off medication that was slowing her death (keeping her on ones easing her suffering) - with the regulations of the UK It's not an easy conversation but it can be done with the right doctors.  Don't let anyone make you feel bad about seeking the right kind of medical approach for your loved one.\n\nTell her you love her every time you say goodbye for the day.  The last time I saw my gran I had such a strong gut feeling it was the last time and couldn't find an easy way to slip it into the conversation with other people around, but I convinced myself I'd see her again and could tell her I loved her then.  I never got to say it 'one last time' and it's my biggest regret with my grandma even 4 years later.  Tell everyone you love them, but especially those you know there's limited time to tell.\n\nYou're doing the right thing in a really difficult situation.  I'm giving you the biggest hug I can mentally beam through a screen and please be gentle with yourself in tough times - it does get better again."]}
