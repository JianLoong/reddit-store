Stealing painkillers is wrong. Stealing painkillers intended to ease someone's dying moments is unforgivable. And you're right it is one step too far.", "NTA.\n\nYour family are enabling your brother by protecting him. He will never change if he has no reason to. By doing the hard thing, you're doing the compassionate thing in the long term. He still may never change, but even if he doesn't, you've made sure a theft is reported and the status of your Nan's medication is safe - i.e. doctors can't say she can't have any as it's been requested too soon. You've done the right thing by everyone involved here, I promise you. \n\nAs a small aside, I'm sorry about your Nan. It's a good few years since I lost mine now and I still remember this period of waiting you're experiencing now. It's tough. Please give yourself a break, life is tough right now and you're still out there doing your best.", "NTA. You're reporting stolen oxycodone. That's a perfectly good thing to do. Plus, if your nan needs more oxycodone, she may need to file a police report before getting more anyway (depending where you're from)\n\nOxycodone going missing is a big deal. If you're mom's on oxy, she needs it. Tell your family you're concerned for your nan, and filed a report to make sure she gets the meds she needs to pass comfortably", "NTA. He needs a wake-up call, probably a stronger one than just a visit from the police frankly.", "NTA!\n\nThere's to factors here, the first being your Nans well being. Without her medication, her comfort in her final days will be diminished and the doctors may be reluctant to represcribe.\n\nThe second is how his behaviour is effecting himself and everyone else.\nIf he has to get in serious trouble to realise harassment and the theft of drugs from a dying person is unacceptable then so it must be done.\n\nSorry about your Nan and I hope you don't let guilt distract you from the grief you must be feeling.\nHe's not worth the time", "NTA, but have Narcan handy. Getting the police involved was the right thing to do, given that amount of oxycodone could be lethal to the wrong person. And use the safe from now on.  You may need the police report to get the oxy refilled.", "NTA. Your druggy thief of a brother needs a lesson. If your parents aren't willing to deal with him, society will.", "NTA.  I'm so sorry you're in the middle of this but you have to protect your Nan.  You may want to contact elder services and see if there's some way to get a TRO against your brother.", "NTA.

The \\*only\\* way the docs will replace the oxy is if you file the police report.  So, your choices are to let your Nan die in terrible pain, or file the report.", "Thank you so much for this, honestly the waiting and the not knowing when it will be is the hardest pain then wanting it to be over sooner for them but realising you're wishing a loved ones death is awful, I'm from the UK so we don't have any kind of dying with dignity or anything like that so I've kinda been obsessively researching, it just seems so cruel to keep them alive as long as possible when they're in huge amounts of pain that can't be controlled (despite all the pain killers)", "They protected him too much and he ended up becoming a person who steals painkillers from his dying grandma. That is like the lowest of low. OP\u2019s parents also need a wake up call.\n\nNTA", "This right here, OP.  NTA.", "I think he has access to it, he's certainly well versed in opiates and could possibly sell some too, but thank you", "I\u2019ve also been there with a loved one, it\u2019s gut wrenching.  Sending you peaceful vibes.", "Your brother needs some tough love. Preferably in jail and/or rehab. You\u2019re NTA", "NTA.  To steal painkillers from a dying person is the lowest scummiest thing, especially from your own grandmother.", "Not one bit.

You did the right thing in reporting him. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Oxycodone is a regulated substance and should only be used by the person for whom the prescription was made and taken in the amount prescribed. There are laws about that.", "NTA. Stealing in general is terrible but stealing from a dying person is the lowest of lows.  Your family is enabling his disgusting behavior and the best thing you can do is distance yourself from him and them. Also, monitor you identity so he doesn\u2019t try and steal it.  Sorry about your Nan, I understand I\u2019ve lost all of my grandparents and it\u2019s terrible", "NTA and I am VERY sorry for and about your nan! Your brother is a major league A and the family is enabling him if they have a problem with you for reporting him! You are awesome for sticking up for your nan though (SOMEONE needs to!)", "NTA. It sounds like he has a lot of family members protecting him. Your grandma needs someone to protect her, and unfortunately that's going to fall on you. He doesn't seem concerned that she may run out of medication before she's able to refill which will cause her unnecessary pain and suffering, and that's cruel of him.", "In America they still treat you like you\u2019re a drug seeker even when you\u2019re on hospice. It\u2019s a good thing OP reported it before grandma needed more", "NTA. As others have said, to steal from a dying person is despicable. Your parents many see your brother as the golden child; hence the constant enabling and forgiving of bad behaviour. Perhaps prepare yourself for a backlash from them if you do report; especially if you are the black sheep. \nAnd, finally I wish your Nan a pain free, peaceful death. And I hope you are ok. What a harsh thing to have happen when you probably just want to spend some time with your Nan. I'm sorry", "\"I'm hoping that's enough to stop him from doing it again.\"\n\nNope, sorry.  Addicts just don't work that way.  Soon it won't just be medications.  It will be electronics, collectibles, and anything else that's not nailed down.  By all means, report him.  But you might want to brace for the reality that he's going to keep stealing regardless.  Lock up all the good stuff.
