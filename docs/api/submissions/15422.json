Since then she's tried many different things from a small ecommerce business, to working freelance as a writer for two individuals and as of recently, a social media manager and email marketing assistant intern. Now, my sister has anxiety and body dysmorphic disorder and has done since she was really young. She's terrified of going outside due to other people seeing her, the way she views herself and it's affecting  her work ethic.\n\nShe was speaking to my mum the other night and crying, explaining how she feels like a failure, that she really wants to work outside again and that she really does try. My mum was comforting her by saying that she will get to where wants to be, she's doing well and there's just a few obstacles my sister has to overcome.\n\nI'm so sick and tired of hearing this same conversation every couple of months. She needs to get up and do something. I joined the conversation and told her that her mental health is really no excuse for sitting around and doing absolutely nothing and that she's uneducated and wasting away her twenties because she won't face the world. I don't feel like I'm in the wrong here but she was very tearful and she refuses to speak to me.\n\nShe's still living at home, can't drive and has no career.

Societal definition of success is fabricated, as is the idea that we're all in some kind of race to reach some grand goal. \n\nAlso you can't tell others they're uneducated when you clearly know absolutely nothing about mental health issues.

My (27M) sister is 22 turning 23 next month and only has had one 'real' job at 16 and left 7 months later. Since then she's tried many different things from a small ecommerce business, to working freelance as a writer for two individuals and as of recently, a social media manager and email marketing assistant intern.

She's terrified of going outside due to other people seeing her, the way she views herself and it's affecting  her work ethic.\n\nShe was speaking to my mum the other night and crying, explaining how she feels like a failure, that she really wants to work outside again and that she really does try.

This is your shallow snobbery and shame of her.  It's all about you.    She is seriously ill and that is a reason, not an excuse for her 'failure to launch'.  She has tried to do a few things with her life in spite of her illness and you mock her.  To you, she will never be good enough no matter what she does.  The truth is you don't like her because she isn't like you.   I'm glad to know she has your mother's kindness and understanding to turn to, and it must be hard for your mother.    Your sister is ill, and you make her tearful. No wonder she won't speak to you.  She hurts so badly on the inside and you constantly twist the knife.  \n\nIt could be that you are projecting your own insecurities onto her.  Surely, there have been times when you have not met up to your own lofty standards. Instead of learning from them, you remind yourself that you are so much more successful than your sister and you actively do so, to her face.   \n\nMy brother is like you, and I am relieved to have dismissed him from my life after decades of his ridicule.

You are 27 and a grown man who apparently can't live independently. Does it make you feel like a big man to crap all over your sister?

So her little girly fake jobs and a few online courses, make her hireable to you??? lol\n\nWe can reasonably assume you haven't actually tried to help in a way that actually helpful because you are too toxic to do that.", "i mean, you\u2019re a teacher. you\u2019re not exactly ceo of a fortune 500", "You sound like you care for your sister, and I do understand where you come from, because I used to think a very, very similar way - that people with anxiety and other mental health issues should just give it their best shot, suck it up, and do it anyway. As someone who was considered a gifted child and is also neurodivergent, I'd also constantly beat myself up for not being good enough, not trying hard enough - surely I had so much more potential hidden under all that anxiety and laziness and whatnot. Surprise, surprise, it resulted in even more anxiety and less motivation to try.  \nIt took me seven years of therapy to realize that there isn't a \"me without anxiety\". It's not like I have more talent and potential underneath a layer of anxiety I must break through first - it's a package deal. There are things that I'll probably never do that people who don't have the same obstacles will easily achieve. Mental health issues are a social disadvantage, just like physical disabilities.  \nYour sister is not lazy and is not wasting her potential - her anxiety is an integrate part of who she is. The personal best she's trying to do is her actual personal best and fullest potential at the moment. If you don't think that's good enough, that's OK, I guess (although I definitely disagree - I'd say her current work experience is a solid start for a 23-year-old). But it's really not helpful to say it to her face. She already feels like a failure, why rub it in?", "I need you to explain to me, like a was a 10 yo, why nursery worker, small business owner, freelance writer and social media manager aren\u2019t job. Please do. Because to me they all sound very much like jobs, maybe entry level so they didn\u2019t pay much but still\u2026 jobs. So please, do tell us, what are REAL JOBS? \n\nAlso, in the case this isn\u2019t some rage bait, let me tell you this. You don\u2019t know anything about resume writing. People with actual experience will tell you to put even volunteer and amateur work in it, if you\u2019re at the beginning, or you\u2019re gunning for a specific job you have no previous paid-job experience. An expert once told me to add hobbies and passions too, if they\u2019re relevant. Your sister\u2019s resume sounds perfectly good (especially for a 22 yo!) and you\u2019re too blinded by your ignorance to see it. \n\nAlso, your ignorance extends to mental health and you should be ashamed of yourself. Read up  on the topic or mind your own business, but stop butting into conversations that don\u2019t concern you (because they don\u2019t. You\u2019re all in your mother\u2019s house. Not yours. And even if it was yours, privacy and Not Your Damn Business still exist) YTA", "Cool", "she goes to therapy but obviously it isn't doing any damn good.", "Christ\u2026 if someone said that to me at my worst moments I probably wouldn\u2019t even be here", "Until she can't pay rent or food. Then what? Are you going to be there to pay for her or are you just here to virtue signal?", "No you wouldn't stop lying and virtue signaling. Not a single one of the YTA people will be there for his sister when she can't pay for food or rent. You all just virtue signal to seem nice when in reality you hurt her in the long run. What's worse anxiety or not being able to afford rent and food? Your opinion is anxiety when anyone with a brain can understand not being able to afford food and rent is way more important. You hinder her with your virtue signaling you aren't a good person.", "Ding ding ding. The way OP talks about his sister in these comments makes me nauseous and feels like no coincidence that she\u2019s having self loathing issues when her family feels and talks to her like this. Absolutely disgusting.", "IKR? Reminds me of the saying \"With friends like you, who needs enemies\"?", "I cannot believe OP is THIS adamant about all of this when he still lives at home", "Sounds like he\u2019s the one who is wasting his 20s, grown up as a mathS teacher still living with his parents at 27.", "As serious as the plague.", "Okay so in your opinion, do you think she's achieved enough to be proud of?", "Right? It is cool! Thanks for proving you don't have empathy!", "It would be more effective if she didn't have you in her life to abuse her.", "Therapy needs time. And a supportive environment. You're very much failing at the latter.", "Do you think she unpacks the issue that her brother\u2019s a monster a lot?", "how does it affect you?", "Good god there is always one in the group. I happen to have two employees and one family member that struggle with mental health issues. I don't stigmatize them, I help in any way I can.

Yes you absolute clown a low paying job is a job.", "Jesus fuck, now who\u2019s uneducated?", "In my opinion, pride is different for everybody.For someone who gets consistent As, getting an A* is an achievement to be proud of. For an extreme agoraphobe, going to the supermarket for the first time is an achievement to be proud of.\n\nIf your sister is proud of the work she has done, then she has achieved something to be proud of. That's not to say that she's the best in the world at what she does, but no achievement should be dismissed.\n\nIf she has to work twice as hard at something and still achieves it, she should certainly be proud.", "I think with the mental health issues you describe getting out of bed daily is enough to be proud of.", "Not for people that take something like anxiety and make it the reason they lay around doing nothing their whole lives", "Everyone and their mother has mental health issues bud. You have an unrealistic view of the world and only virtue signal. You won't be there when she can't pay her rent. You won't be there when she can't buy food. Stop pretending like you care cause you don't.", "He should know.\nTeachers aren't paid that well in the grand scheme of things. \n\nAnd living with mother, he obviously can't pay his own way.", "Whatever makes you feel better about yourself, buddy.", "Not pretending but I'm not going to convince someone as bitter as you. I truly hope you find some happiness in your life.", "Lol enjoy your loser friends on antiwork.", "I am very happy in life. Got a great job amazing girlfriend and friends. Lots of hobbies I love to do and travel a bunch as well. I'm not bitter I'm just not a virtue signaling asshole who thinks saying the \"correct\" thing online is actually going to help. You won't be there to help her when she can't pay for her food or her rent. You are the one who is harming her chances at a good life.", "That one moment you piss someone off so much they go through your profile lmao. Triggered much? \ud83d\ude02"]}
