Listen to them. He either wants to isolate you so he can control then abuse you or he's jealous of your business success. Having a man with bad business sense try to persuade you to make bad business decisions is not a good problem to have. His insecurity will financially ruin you if you let it. Dating him is one thing but you need to be *extremely* careful about having kids with him. He already doesn't respect your very reasonable boundaries.", "NTA, and your bf is showing some red flags.\n\nWanting to be in full control of the money while you're stuck at home (cooking, cleaning, and rearing children) is a common financial abuse tactic.\n\nYou had this business before him. He knew when you two began dating. Telling you to sell it so he can pre-emptively take care of you is controlling and weird imo.", "This one set off my spidey sense. The only thing you need from him for a baby can be picked up at a sperm bank nowadays. Him wanting to \"spoil\" you is not a good problem to have. It's a giant red flag. He is looking for a traditional role relationship and that is not compatible with your goals and life. Start paying more attention to his behavior and find the little by-little things he is trying to control. NTA", "NTA. Keep your business and definitely keep it separate from him. That means separate bank accounts, and nothing about the business with his name attached to it. \n\nBeing financially independent is a huge deal in case things don\u2019t work out.", "NTA. This is very troubling to me. You have a successful business that you enjoy, and he insists that you give it all up just to birth babies and clean house?\n\nYou may love him, but it sounds like your visions of the future are drastically incompatible.\n\nIn my experience, the best of relationships are the meeting and joining of individuals. They can live happily on their own, but they enjoy each other's company more. No *needing* the other to fulfill them, not *dependent* on the other to care for them. People who share their strengths together.\n\nThis guy's outlook would seriously bother me. You can try couple's counseling to see if there's room for middle ground...but do not ever give up the life you enjoy for anybody else. You are NTA.", "NTA, but it sounds like he\u2019s having a hard time that you would be able to walk away and won\u2019t be trapped. Should you ever want to.", "NTA\n\nThis is a huge red flag he's waving. He doesn't respect you as a business woman and owner. \n\nHe considers it something to keep you busy until you become that stay at home wife and mother he wants. He doesn't even think you could possibly own a business without a man's help.\n\nHe isn't giving you a choice and once he has financial control over you, it's just going to get worse. Have you told him that he is free to stay home with the children? I doubt it even entered his mind because that's women's work.\n\nI hate to say end the relationship because of this, but it's a pretty big divide. Never give up your own income or independence for a man. Especially something you've worked so hard to achieve. If you proceed with this relationship, don't commingle your money.", "NTA. The two of you want very different things for your future. Have a serious conversation about where this is relationship is headed and be very firm with your boundaries. You\u2019ve done no wrong and it\u2019s both sexist and inconsiderate for him to unilaterally decide your future on your behalf. Absolutely not!", "NTA\n\nSorry, OP. You sound incompatible at this point. He wants a \"little wifey at home\" and you... just aren't ever gonna be that.", "NTA. \n\nDo you want to be a 1950's housewife or follow in your Moms footsteps? \n\nYou're just dating still. Now is the time to decide if you want to have a future together and discuss what that will be. You can love someone deeply and still break up; its better than the resentment and divorce later.", "NTA. Is this guy from the 1800s?", "NTA.\n\nMaybe he is jealous because you make more money(I\u2019ve seen this in the past) or you do something you love without getting tired.", "NTA. There\u2019s a very legitimate reason why you get the ick when he says he wants to spoil you\u2026 It\u2019s because he\u2019s a misogynistic AH brimming with toxic masculinity. \n>\nHe\u2019s incredibly jealous and insecure of your successful business. So much so that it\u2019s easier for him to give your DAD the credit for YOUR success.

He is sexist, and the way he is wanting you to give up your business for your ego is a massive red flag.\n\nThis is practically your first real relationship and he wants you to be financially dependable. He is pulling away to force you to do what he wants. You should be RUNNING.", "NTA. You got the ick. That\u2019s all you really need.", "NTA, but it sounds like a need for some communication and radical candor is ahead!\n\nI have two gut reactions:\n\n1) Give him the benefit of the doubt. Possibly have a conversation about why your business gives you a sense of purpose and joy. For some people, it's harder to understand how work can be so enjoyable. I find myself in the camp of working to live rather than living to work. And that's ok. My SO is my opposite, and I try to help him slow down and seek balance.

Now men are being said to be somewhat obtuse in this area, so you may really have to bend it out in neon before he understands. He may even have some superannuated idea that once you are married, he will be calling the shots in your marriage.

He is repeatedly and forcefully telling you that he wants you to be wholly dependent and reliant on him.

TBD. I will say his attitude around 'well obviously once we have a family you'll stay home and I will provide,' esp. the sell your business part, is sending up red flags for me; sounds like you're both going to have to do a lot of work to get on the same page around that stuff, and if he's already being distant and sulky when you gently try to explain that you don't wanna be a housewife, not sure how well that's going to go.

Guys like him want women pregnant because that ties them to them.", "NTA. Has he never heard of a dual-income household? Yes, spouses need each other more when they have a kid. But that isn\u2019t at all relevant to you having a business. The lack of logical connection here sounds like he\u2019s trying to entrap you into dependency. \n\nAnother concerning factor is he seems to be unwilling to take \u201cno\u201d as an answer. This shows his lack of respect for your accomplishments and is quite misogynistic. I think you will in the long-term head for some rocky times. Dating is one thing, having a long-term relationship with a child involved is a whole different ball game. I can say from experience as a father. Lack of flexibility is a big problem with many men (also from personal experience, but luckily my wife straightened me out!). This needs to be dealt with now, not when a child is on the way.", "NTA. Dude seems like he wants you to fill what he feels is the traditional role in a relationship and you're just not a traditional gal. That seems like it'd be a tough idea to reconcile as he was prob raised that way and changing a thought pattern like that is difficult. If he can't accept the person you are, that's a problem.

I think that's a reasonable position.\n\nMy judgment simply leaves open the idea that this guy is an undereducated country bumpkin who means well, treats her well otherwise, and simply thinks that a man's only reason for existing is to provide for his family.", "I did not mention divorce.\n\nI was talking about accidents, death, anything that would cause bf unable to work. \n\nHe will be the sole provider for a family. He will carry the health insurance. His income would have to be enough to provide at least 6 months of living expenses in savings including bills like mortgage and loans. \n\nOP doesn't have a college education or career to \"fall back on\". After up to 18+ years of staying at home, she won't have any skills to enter the workforce and she will be over 50. She has a successful business that she built from nothing that this man wants her to sell. He wants to make her dependent.", "NTA OP, please be careful. Do not let this man impregnate you!", "NTA. While in his mind (maybe) he means we'll, this is a very controlling behavior and would likely get worse where he then tells you what you can spend money on. Should you sell your business, he will either want to manage where it goes or how to spend it on a house that he wants. \n\nYou need to put your foot down now and hard or this will not go well, especially when he also makes comments about your family getting your business off the ground and not that you were capable of doing it yourself.", "NTA.\n\nThe most generous interpretation here is that you are just not compatible. You need someone who respects you and your initiative and who wants to create a future with you rather than for you. As for him, there are women out there who want exactly what he\u2019s offering.\n\nThe more cynical interpretation is that you need to run.", "NTA but he is.\n\nYou've been together for 2 years and he still doesn't know what you want, that you like what you are doing, that the business is very important to you. Or he just doesn't want to consider these things. He has a scenario in his head about family life. This scenario is more important to him than the real person he claims to love. That's why he is distant. He sees you as a function rather than a person.", "Honey the field is filled with SO MANY RED FLAGS it looks like a murder scene. This is textbook domestic violence 101. It is up to you to remove the rose pink glasses or keep them.\n\nNTA but seriously, this man is SCREAMING \"I will control my wife\" and you seem deaf", "Oh honey. I didn\u2019t even need to read all that (but i did) to know that you\u2019re NTA and he is toxic. He wants you to be a good lil SAHM that he can control and who will be financially dependent on him which is abuse. Get out now.", "NTA your bf is trying to make you financially dependent on him so you can\u2019t leave him i would do some soul searching and maybe couples therapy before even considering making any bigger steps with the red flags he\u2019s waving. what\u2019s next? he expects you to be a full time sahm who cooks and cleans for him and gets him a beer while he watches the game? i wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you did go along with what he says that he starts holding it over your head that he makes all the money and he pays the bills so what he says goes.", "NTA. Maybe it's because I've been hanging around the wrong subreddits lately, but I would advise you to be very careful with how you proceed. He sounds like he wants to control you and have you trapped at the house barefoot and pregnant. If you get into a situation like that you may be trapped for years to come and may never recover financially, emotionally or socially. Be very careful", "Throw the whole man away. He wants to control you and have you barefoot and pregnant looking over the house. Which you obviously don't want. Doesn't matter how much you love him now, unless he makes a major change in perspectives, which is seriously doubtful, you two are not compatible. Things will just get worse.\n\nYou're NTA and it'll be better for you to cut ties now instead of wasting your time on a relationship that isn't going to work without some MAJOR changes. These are huge red flags you don't want to ignore.", "NTA and frankly this sounds like a major incompatibility issue.", "So has he been spoiling you?   No need to wait until you are financially dependent on him to start, is there.\n\nWhy did he pursue you if he knew from the start that you are financially independent.  There are many women who have zero desire to earn income he could have chosen.  So why go for you knowing he needs a woman dependent?\n\nIf he was so intensely attracted to you he just couldn\u2019t resist you in site of your accomplishments, and since he wants to spoil you so much, why is he so intent on making you a servant?", "> I realize this is a good problem to have and I think he really does intend to be nice but every time he says this it gives me an ick\n\nNo it's not, it's manipulation", "Please don't have a kid with this guy.", "Listen to your gut! NTA", "Please watch you birth control. He may try to baby trap you.", "I think your outlook on your independence and relationships is very healthy!", "because a lot of men like to think that parenting is easy and doesn\u2019t compare to the stress of a 40hr work week because their partner is at home all the time and they see home as a work free (therefore stress free for them) space.", "I think you're referring to your instincts, and they're important to follow!", "I don\u2019t think you are being paranoid at all. Trust your gut instincts and don\u2019t let everyone try to change you. He is sounding a little sketchy, and maybe he just isn\u2019t the person for you to spend your life with. NTA.", "Sexism and toxic masculinity was his upbringing? Does he call it 'traditional' too?\n\nTradition is just pressure from dead people.", "Also he credits her dad and not her mum with helping her. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a mistake or an assumption, I think it boils down to his toxic masculinity", "He is offering OP to do something she doesn't want to do and to live a life she doesn't want to live. Even just offering this without asking first what SHE wants, is a little red flag. The big red flag is that after OP explained that she doesn't want the life bf offered, he totally ignored her wishes and came with a suggestion to sell the business. What a great marriage it would be - he has a full financial control, and ignores what she says."]}
