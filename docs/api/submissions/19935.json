IANAL but your parents need to establish a guardianship or a trust for your brother's continued care. If your brother ends up \"at the mercy of the state\" it would be your parents' fault for not taking legal steps to ensure that he has the care he needs.", "NAH \n\nYour brother needs care. The inheritance should go towards his continued living accommodations and whoever gets guardianship of him if you two don\u2019t want to do it", "NTA. I personally would tell the parents they need to make sure that there is enough money to take of the person who needs it most rather than splitting it up between the children. \n\nI have autism as well as my oldest son. As an adult I am able to factor out things that I can\u2019t handle from my life and live somewhat averagely. My son however will not be like that, his need are different and even at the age of 9 we have already started preparing for the rest of his life. I love when my kids help eachother, all parents do, but we are very aware of how responsibilities get put on siblings who have their own lives to live. If we see our daughters overly comforting his brother are helping him with things like tying his shoes we jump in and tell them \u201cthat was nice but Mom/Dad can help him with that. Your job is to love & play with your brother not do things like this\u201d. I don\u2019t want our other kids feeling like they are \u201cstuck\u201d caring for someone and it cramping their life plans. A huge chunk of our will now, with the kids all under 9, is setting aside the majority of funds for when my son is an adult so he is siblings don\u2019t feel like they need to take care of him.", "NTA.  There is no guaranty that an inheritance will be given and, if given, no obligation that you use it for the care of your brother.  Your parents have the opportunity to set up trusts or other instruments to ensure the care of your brother.  Their estate plan is up to them.  Any money you get is yours to use as you deem fit.", "NTA.\n\nIf your parents want one or both of you to agree to be conservators for your brother, the proper approach would be for them ask you. Consent is important. Trying to guilt you into it is a terrible idea.\n\nThat said, it makes a ton of sense for them to create a trust to provide funding for your brother's care. So any inheritance they might give you should be split three ways between you and your siblings. It doesn't need to be split equally.\n\nThe trust they create could include a provision to pay a stipend to you and/or your sister for serving as conservator. That would be more fair than expecting you to fill the role for free.\n\nI would love to be wrong, but your parents' statement, \"You should agree to do this because we're leaving you an inheritance\" sounds like what someone would say if they know they haven't provided enough financial support for your brother's ongoing care and want you to take over when they're gone. \"We're helping you a little. You should feel obligated to help your brother a lot.\"\n\nBut you're not your brother's parent. You don't have nearly as much moral obligation to provide for his care as your parents do.", "NTA.  If you aren\u2019t comfortable being a guardian you should not be.  There are options, you parents can put money into a trust for your brother and engage a guardian like a law firm to make decisions on his behalf.", "NTA.\n\nParents should get brother settled in a group home & use the 'inheritance' to set up a trust to support him, with a lawyer as a trustee that you and twin oversee.", "Okay your not the a-hole for not waiting to be forced into taking care of your Brother when your parents pass  away. \n\nHowever YTA for being privileged to believe that \"everyone\" gets and inheritance.\n\nEdited to remove the word albiest.", "NTA. What you told your parents is true.\n\nIf you two sisters end up being the guardians for your disabled brother, it should be because you *want* to, not because you feel obliged to as your part of some financial transaction. You have the right to say no.\n\nYour parents seem to be wielding the inheritance like a weapon. This is wrong of them. I get that they are concerned about the welfare of your brother, but it's still wrong.", "NTA you didn't do anything wrong", "NAH\n\nThe state should not be the guardian if he has siblings. \n\nIf you are in the US the state already covers the cost of the group home. So you would be responsible for keeping up with the paperwork.  He\u2019s also not going to have to move in with either of you.\n\nHowever, what your parents are probably doing is providing supplemental enrichment and activities for him. DSP\u2019s are paid pennies. And while they do group activities, it\u2019s not every single day. So your parents are spending their time and money to do that. \n\nThat\u2019s the part they\u2019d probably like you to continue. You can choose to do it yourself or you can choose to hire a supplemental DSP to fill that role. \n\nHowever, both you and your sister should start talking to your parents about what they do to support your brother. \n\nRemember, you were born before the ADA passed. So even though it\u2019s been around for a while disability services are incredibly uneven state to state and even county to county. Your parents were middle aged when it was passed. I can tell you that they probably went through hell trying to get services for your brother. So there is a fair bit of trauma there. \n\nSo yeah, talk to your parents, ask to talk to their service coordinator from the state, and even ask to talk to the group home operator. All of them will give you perspective.", "YTA - for the question in title about inheritance. Yes. Leaving money/belongings to children/grandchildren is a privilege. And the way things are going is probably going to become less common.\n\nUltimately you\u2019re not obligated to be guardian to your brother, your parents aren\u2019t obligated to give you an inheritance.\n\nBut acting like it\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d comes from a classist POV.", "QUESTION: Do you care about your brother at all?\n\nBecause what your parents are asking of you isn't really a big deal.  Making decisions which are in the best interest of a family member is something a lot of people do because they love their family and want the best for them.\n\nI find it hard to believe you are 40 because you sound like a spoiled child who can't deal with a little responsibility.\n\nYTA", "NTA There is nothing inherently wrong with being selfish. You should not be pressured into being his guardian. That being said, I would love to see if you did not get any inheritance at all and all that went to a trust for your brother, to a charity for animal rescue or to a homeless shelter.", "YTA. The lack of empathy is shocking. I sincerely hope your parents do not leave you an inheritance.  Having a guardian is important when someone is a vulnerable adult. It is terrible when the state had to pick a guardian,  which can and does happen when family does not step up. If you and your sister cannot do that, perhaps your parents can find someone who actually cares.", "YTA.  Neither of you should get the inheritance. It should go towards a trust for your brother so that he will be well taken care of when both your parents die.", "ESH: it sounds like you and your sister are not considering your brother's wellbeing at all. sure, you do not have any obligation to take on being his guardian, but it sounds like your only concern is that you're unhappy with the way your parents, who just want to make sure their son doesn't end up in the hands of strangers who don't care if he lives or dies, have handled conversations about inheritance and his guardianship. maybe they leveraged their inheritance to try and make sure he would get better care, and maybe that was a bit manipulative, but it's absolutely their right to say \"we're going to use it to make sure your brother, who is not able to provide for himself, gets good care. you can make sure he is cared for and get the inheritance, but if not then we're going to find another way to use it.\" and it's honestly really fucked up that you're butthurt over that and not at all concerned with what happens to him when they die.", "NTA for being not 'keen' on being your brother's guardian.\n\nYTA for an erroneous exaggeration: \" \"...an adult child getting an inheritance from their deceased parents **is not at all special or unusual**\". \n\nWhat source confirms this? Your family's generational experience does not confirm the norm. Infact, \"Almost three out of every four Americans are not leaving anything behind for their families except maybe a lot of headaches (debt). ...68% of the deceased had outstanding credit card debt, 37% had unpaid mortgages, 25% had unpaid car loans, 12% had unpaid personal loans and 6% had unpaid student loans.

It's your parents money, and they get to decide what to do with it.\n\nAlso, you should probably handle your brother's affairs. Yeah, you're stuck with him, but he's stuck with a debilitating mental disorder. Imagine how he feels.", "YTA big time.  I hope this post is fake.  If I was your parents I would leave all of my inheritance to the son since he is actually unable to provide for himself.
