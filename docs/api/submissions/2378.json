Your stepdaughter is your family now too and you want all your family to be together during this time. With that said, your girls are old enough to decide a lot of things for themselves. Considering that both girls gave no thought to attending Jessica's party, it's pretty clear that the girls aren't close with their stepsister. Which isn't all that surprising considering that they've only been family with her for a little over a year, so you said, and only spent 50% of that short amount of time under your roof with her. Speaking of which, what's Jessica's stance on all of this? She may not even care that they don't plan to come. She might even be happy about it depending on what their relationship is like. Your daughters may one day grow closer to your stepdaughter, but maybe they won't. What is certain is that if you try to force a \"happy together family\" like this you will make them hate each other.", "YTA. Yes, family time is important, but you can't force them to spend time with them. They want to be with their real family instead of being at the birthday of a step sister they forgot about, what's so hard to understand about that?", "Yta", "YTA for saying that three teens are not so bad because your daughters spend so much time at their mothers.   You don\u2019t mention Jessica spending time at her Dads, so it seems she lives with you full time.

Whether you realize it or not, you have replaced your daughters.  They realize it.   You need to respect them and pay more attention to their feelings.", "YTA for having zero idea what's happening in any of your daughters lives.\n\nYou never asked your daughters if they were free, or if they would like to be there. Which would have been sensible because they spend 50% of thier time at thier mums are are going to have things going on that you don't know about.\n\nYou also said in a comment that you have no idea if your stepdaughter wants them there because you never asked her.

You can't force them to love anyone, but you can say that your you are raising decent human beings that are kind to others.

That isn't their actual sister, just because you want them to be, doesn't mean you can force it, then they will only hate and resent each other.

Keep forcing it and they will want NOTHING to do with STEPsister and YOU.

And I'm a grown adult!! Please stop trying to force your kids to have a relationship that needs time to develop.

You mentioned the girls are with you 50% of the time so I\u2019m sure they see Jessica enough.", "YTA - you can't force relationships, you have to let them grow naturally.  Forcing your daughters to go to your step daughter's birthday party, heck even saying \"she's been your sister for over a year\" will do nothing but cause resentment, which will make it harder to develop the relationship you're hoping for.", "YTA.\n\nFirst of all, does Jessica even want them there? At 16 years old I wasn't keen on having my sibling at my birthday party **and we're twins**. We had our own friends that we wanted to celebrate with and we would do a dinner with our parents outside of that. \n\nSecondly, it sounds like you didn't communicate well enough with your daughters and ex wife about the party. You assumed they would attend rather than invite them to come to the party. They have family coming from away, it makes complete sense that they want to spend time with people they are closer to. \n\nThird and finally, Kim is right, she is nearly an adult and grounding her and taking away her phone is not actually how you foster a relationship with her and her step sibling. This is the pivotal point in time where you and Kim need to come to a place of building an adult relationship that respects her autonomy as an individual.", "YTA\n\nThey haven't been sisters for a year now, they've bern stepsiblings.

They don't have to attend your stepdaughters birthday party especially if it doesn't fall on your week with them. They can always do something on the Sunday with you all like you suggested to their mother. If its good enough for her and visiting family, it should be good enough for you, who they see biweekly.\n\nIts a invitation, not a summons.

Do you think you achieved anything by that aside of her resenting you and your stepdaughter?\n\nAlso this is your ex's weekend I assume? And she is right, you can't control your daughters like that anymore.\n\nFurthermore they have known the stepdaughter for a year? There isn't even a proper relationship yet, and you certainly can't force it.", "YTA and a massive one at that, especially if this is one of your ex-wife's court appointed days of custody.\n\nYou treated your daughters and ex-wife with no respect, riding roughshod over their family's plans to visit that had obviously been laid out to coincidence with the girls being at their mother's.  To top it off, you are effectively now holding them prisioner and trying to bar the two daughters from seeing their mother and vice versa.\n\nPrepare to lose your relationship with your daughters and you will thoroughly deserve to do so.", "YTA. First off, they haven't grown up together and they're likely too old to force a sisterly bond. \n\nBy forcing them and honestly bullying them, you're only driving them further away.

Maybe you should have a think about this?", "YTA\n\nYou realise this is how you make your children hate both you AND their step sister? Right?", "Dude. Your old-fashioned attitudes are not working for you.  Your daughters have their whole lives ahead of them in which they can choose how much or how little time they spend with you.
