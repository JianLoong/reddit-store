I\u2019m almost positive she has some form of ADHD because she is incredibly forgetful and at times careless. She\u2019ll do things like leave her purses, books, phone, and at times keys in the car. Boil an egg on the stove and only remember once the water has completely evaporated and is burning, as well as other appliance related problems. \n\nShe always talks about how she\u2019ll get around to getting diagnosed and medicated but never does. Apparently she\u2019s been like this her whole life. \nAnyways, we recently moved in together( a house that belonged to my grandmother but we both pay utilities/tax/bills) and it\u2019s been great honestly except for these little problems. The major point of contention rn is how she will at times leave through the back door, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT on \u201cwalks\u2019, and be gone for hours. We have had disagreements about this multiple times in the past where I\u2019ve told her that her walks are dangerous and make me uncomfortable. \n\nShe will leave at around 1 - 2 am to walk around our rural neighborhood for hours at a time, sometimes when her phone is on low battery. I have no idea why she does this. She\u2019s told me that it\u2019s \u201cexercise\u201d and she enjoys the solitude but it makes me uncomfortable af. I worry about what could happen in the middle of the night with no one around, and she doesn\u2019t appreciate me coming with her too much. Worse yet, she will leave the back door unlocked because she still hasn\u2019t gotten her own set of house keys. So it is up to me to readmit my wayward gf every few nights. \n\nI\u2019ve decide to draw my line. I\u2019ve refused to unlock the back door and had it locked from both ends so she\u2019s forced to use the front door for her trips. Not even she would dare leave the front door unlocked to go gallivanting into the night, so I\u2019m good on that end. The only thing is that she got incredibly frustrated at me and called me a controlling AH and hasn\u2019t been talking to me. I don\u2019t think I am when she refuses to behave like a literal sensible adult. \n\nSo yeah AITAH? I find it ridiculous cause she could simply go out to get her own pair of keys to thwart me, but she\u2019s the type that can\u2019t have too many errands on her mind. She will have a list of five and then feel overwhelmed and tapped out after completing one.

I would go out at midnight, 1am, 2am. Have a lovely long nighttime walk, felt at peace with the world, and loves the solitude.\n\nI did, however, always bring a fully charged phone from which I could easily call for help. Plus I locked my flat like a normal person. I also had an app where my family could see my location (though they lived in a different city and I didn't tell them about my nighttime strolls).\n\nOh, and I also have ADHD.\n\nJust sharing cos she could actually just be enjoying a nighttime stroll.", "NTA - you're not locking her in. She can get in and out perfectly fine, just not through the door she'd prefer. Besides, she like exercise so walking a few extra steps to use the front door shouldn't be a problem.", "NTA\n\nHer doing that is a safety hazard not just for herself but her home. \n\nAnd, she can still go through the front door so OP has not locked her in. If she so chooses not to go through the front door then that\u2019s on her. \nI don\u2019t think him locking it is something that should happen. But, these aren\u2019t normal circumstances and OP does state she is extremely forgetful.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine why she does this, and I do think a conversation about what causes this is necessary. It\u2019s probably better for her to speak to a therapist if willing. \n\nAnd, I can understand people just have their quirks but this is oddly specific of an action to do consistently.", "NTA. What\u2019s wrong w all of the commenters saying he\u2019s controlling?? She is objectively doing an extremely unsafe thing, and also endangering other people by forgetting to lock the door. There is no way she\u2019s stupid enough to not realize how it\u2019s not safe to go on hour long walks at 2 in the morning with a dying phone; besides, he\u2019s also brought it up to her many times. It would be one thing if she\u2019s just clueless, but she\u2019s knowingly disregarding HER safety, HIS safety, and HIS valid discomfort just to engage in her dangerous walks, which is honestly extremely selfish imo. He literally bought her a taser and she still forgets it!  He\u2019s done everything he can to make sure to accommodate her walks, to help her be safer and also to alleviate his justifiable concerns, and yet she still refuses to make any changes. She is aware she may have ADHD and this is why she is forgetful yet she does nothing to fix that despite knowing her ADHD-induced behavior is dangerous to herself and her boyfriend and makes him justifiably worried??\n\nShe is obviously aware of the dangers of leaving doors unlocked because she won\u2019t do it with the front door. Her refusing to do it with the back door is frankly, her just being unempathetic to her boyfriends rightful concerns + lazy. \n\nAlso, if she so desperately wants to walk she can literally just get her own keys. But no, once again, her ADHD causes her to be forgetful and she is fully aware of the need to treat it, is fully capable of doing so, but refuses to and instead just obliviously and selfishly does things that\u2019s not good for her or her bf. OP is not forbidding her to go on walks or physically preventing her from doing so. He is not controlling.", "INFO: Does she live here? If so, why does she not already have keys?", "NAH,\n\nBut I can\u2019t help thinking there is something else going on here. There is to many unaccountable factors that don\u2019t make sense in terms of normal everyday behaviour and skills (task management, memory, risk management and probably others). \n\nSeriously, I don\u2019t think you have an AITA kind of problem here.

It helps if she is on medication.\n\nFor other things, structural solutions will help. Such as:\n\n\\- Replace the lock on the backdoor with one that automatically falls in the lock.\n\n\\- Accept that she is an adult and gets to weigh the risks and benefits of nightly walks herself. Maybe you can discuss mitigation, such as wearing a whistle and an iWatch.\n\n\\- Make sure she has good noise cancelling headphones.\n\n\\- Make sure you have good smoke detectors.\n\n\\- Invest in appliances that will either stop when done, or make noise (such as an egg steamer).", "No judgement because it's such a non-issue if you just get her a set of keys. When you're both free go get her a set of keys cut, problem solved. She probably likes the solitude of walking at night as it's quiet and less busy, especially if she has ADHD.  It might also be worth asking her if she wants you to help her start the ball rolling with the diagnosis process because task initiation for ADHDers can be a massive problem.", "Lol, you moved in with someone that will burn down your house sooner or later bc she can't be bothered to remember the stove?

Maybe not the case with your girlfriend because schizophrenia is more common in males but just putting that out there", "NTA  You can get locks that automatically lock but only use fingerprint to unlock it. Your GF would never have to worry about remembering keys. Do you really see this relationship as long term since she refuses to get help? What if you ever have a child together?

But the insistence on wandering around at unsafe hours with a dying phone and also insisting on going out a specific door? I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s ADHD related. Risk taking is common with ADHD but that\u2019s more impulsive, not planned nightly outings at the same time. It\u2019s also super weird that she doesn\u2019t want you with her. If she has excess energy to burn off, there are safer ways. If she needs to clear her head, there are safer ways. She\u2019s also putting your safety at risk if she doesn\u2019t lock the door, and she\u2019s being inconsiderate by causing you anxiety due to her risky behavior. If she won\u2019t stop, or won\u2019t give a reasonable explanation, she is showing you that your feelings are not a priority for her. Something to note is that alcohol and drug abuse is a very very common occurrence for people with ADHD. As are eating disorders. It certainly seems like that could be what\u2019s happening here, and she might be hiding it from you due to shame or something else.

Would she be able to leave the house?\n\nIf she can still go out the front door and lock it behind her, then I can\u2019t see the problem. \n\nBut she should have a key so she can get in and out of the house through the front door whenever she likes.\n\nWe live in a fairly safe area, but there have been break-ins\n\nYesterday we (me, my daughter 42, my son 38) went to a local event where our troupe were dancing. Whilst there my son bumped into his mate and so we left him there chatting whilst they caught up and then went for a drink together. I rang my son at 10:30pm as I suspected that he didn\u2019t have keys. He didn\u2019t. He was still drinking and as it would have taken him 30-45 minutes to walk home (I suspected that he wouldn\u2019t leave for at least another hour) I agreed to leave the back door unlocked.\n\nI actually feel safer with the front door locked when I am asleep.\n\nAnd if I can\u2019t sleep, I have been known to go out in the early hours to enjoy the night air.

In the morning the news would be going on how a gang killed a person near her house and she'd casually say \"Weird I walked there last night.\" As if IT'S NOTHING. And I supposed to be living in the worst rural part on our island! \n\nExperience with similar people aside, she also was as nonchalant as you girlfriend about her safety and the safety of her own home and this nut job actually left through the front door and leaves it unlocked! Have a serious hard talk and give an ultimun. Either she takes walks in the evening before sundown to get rid of energy, you walk with her at night before it's 12am or she can go pack and walk out the door. You shouldn't have to deal with her putting your house and you in danger as she doesn't even regard her own safety.

And yes, I know she could use the front door but you admitted in your post that you knew she wouldn\u2019t leave the front door unlocked or get a new set of keys so you *knew* you\u2019d be restricting her movements when you made that choice.\n\nIf it was truly about the door and not about restricting her then you could easily have gotten her a set of keys.", "YTA, but with good intentions.

I have no idea why she does this. She\u2019s told me that it\u2019s \u201cexercise\u201d and she enjoys the solitude but it makes me uncomfortable af. I worry about what could happen in the middle of the night with no one around, and she doesn\u2019t appreciate me coming with her too much. Worse yet, she will leave the back door unlocked because she still hasn\u2019t gotten her own set of house keys. So it is up to me to readmit my wayward gf every few nights. \n\nI\u2019ve decide to draw my line. I\u2019ve refused to unlock the back door and had it locked from both ends so she\u2019s forced to use the front door for her trips. Not even she would dare leave the front door unlocked to go gallivanting into the night, so I\u2019m good on that end. The only thing is that she got incredibly frustrated at me and called me a controlling AH and hasn\u2019t been talking to me. I don\u2019t think I am when she refuses to behave like a literal sensible adult. \n\nSo yeah AITAH? I find it ridiculous cause she could simply go out to get her own pair of keys to thwart me, but she\u2019s the type that can\u2019t have too many errands on her mind. She will have a list of five and then feel overwhelmed and tapped out after completing one. I love her but she is insane.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Or accept things going wrong is part of life, and if you're going to live in fear of that you may as well leave life behind \n\nPEOPLE BEING SCARED OF THE DARK IS A JOKE\n\nPEOPLE ASSUMING OTHER PEOPLE ACT LIKE ANIMALS IS PATHETIC \n\nThis place is an echo chamber for pathetic thinking and actual arseholes to validate each other \n\nPS OP is an asshole, get your partner keys and issue is resolved. Stop trying to stop someone else doing something that makes you uncomfortable. Don't like it,then leave. The world should not have to hear your issues let alone bend to your discomfort", ">op expects her to get her own set made\n\nYou mean, like any sane adult would? This is normal. OP inherits house, invites gf to move in, gives keys to gf so she can go and have her own set made. This is normal adult things that take minimum effort, time and energy, why would you make an issue over this?", "She is not being prevented from getting keys. She has not taken the initiative to make her own set of keys. I\u2019m amazed by your persistence on this matter. You\u2019re like obsessed with this woman not making her own goddamn set of keys. This isn\u2019t a landlord/tenant dynamic.", "I didn\u2019t say it was easy. I am saying it\u2019s important. Op gf doesn\u2019t get a pass for foisting her mental issues on other people and doing absolutely nothing about it. I absolutely get how hard it is, I\u2019ve been through getting my kid diagnosed and all her related issues.", "No, much better to foist all your issues on your partner and burn the house down. \n\nWe can\u2019t help our mental health illnesses and struggles. But we also don\u2019t get to leave them untreated and expect our loved ones to set themselves on fire accommodating us. Whether it\u2019s depression, adhd, bipolar, etc etc. \n\nI have utmost sympathy to the challenges facing getting help. Esp if parents turned a blind eye when help was most readily available through the school system. But giggling and making your partner responsible isn\u2019t the solution.", "OP is not her landlord though", "The insane thing is that she won't go get a set of keys so she can do that without putting either of them at risk. He's not hiding the keys from her. He's not charging her. He's not tying her to the bed. She's too lazy/forgetful etc to go get house keys\n\nUtterly ridiculous. Cry harder", "I honestly didn't know. Especially if it's a house.", "Oh god. That sounds bad\n\nGood thing modern locks exist.\nMy dorm has key-fobs for the building/elevator/laundry/bike garage, the same one you use on your apartment door. In shared flat you have an extra key for your room and of course one for the mailbox", "It's not difficult to do it yourself, you just have to change the lock lock barrels in the doors. Me and my husband did it in our house. It's really nice to just have a car key and a door key to carry around.", "My sister lives in the UK. They don't have a garage and the garden is only accessible through the kitchen and living room.  So they have 3 keys? Front and the two for the garden. Could be the same key, though, didn't notice", "IF you own and stuff, call a quality locksmith. They should be able to set you up with most if not all of your locks to be single key.", "Oh \ud83d\ude05\nYeah, well, in Germany we (mostly) have one key for all. Except the mailbox, that's a smaller one. Don't know about brand new buildings though.", "I have ADHD and you continue to talk to people like you're the only person with some life experience here. \n\nAs an adult, I cannot make the doctor appointments or any of that nessiscary for my husband, just as well as he cannot make his girlfriend get treatment if she does not want to. \n\nYou need to just stop.", "Adderall gave me nonstop nausea, Ritalin made me want to pace until I died, and then concerta worked just okay. Then I got pregnant and had to stop all meds lol. Oops. But I counted concerta as a win.", "That is not my issue, she has no keys to the house. She can have all the disorders in the world and that does not change that he needs to give her a copy of the keys. \n\nShe needs help sure but adhd therapy often includes walks before bed. She may be working on getting a diagnosis there hard to get as an adult. Harder as a women as the symptoms are not allwase the same as the ones often used to diagnose. \n\nI don't know what she's done to get a diagnosis. I do know it's impossible to unlock a locked door without keys to the house. \n\nAs far as I know there are lots of diffrent keys one can have like car keys. Op states she has no house keys and needs to go have them made. \n\nUnless he responds to my info question I will take how I read the post the way I read it.", "Soo make copies...", "OK then why is it on her to make a copy like lmao make some logic here. \n\n1. You need to make copies of the key it's your job\n\n2. You can't have the key to copy it's the only one.", "Then unlike op you would not be controlling. Also look up statistics it's actually the most dangerous to walk at dawn or dusk not at night or during the day. For like all the things you listed.", "Hmm this was odd. Are you ok? No I don\u2019t want special treatment. I\u2019m saying no one who sees me sees a threat because I\u2019m a barely 5 ft tall woman? You can literally put your hand on my forehead and hold me back from touching you. \n\nI live in the northeast US. We lock our doors here. I live in a safe neighborhood and everyone still locks their doors. We lock our cars too. \n\nWhy is it so hard to accept that some people just don\u2019t have the privilege of not caring about their safety?\n\nEdit: just want to add that this random online rant is exactly why I don\u2019t trust people lol. You seem like someone that people should be concerned about. One person online says they don\u2019t trust people and you go off like this? This behavior is exactly what I hope to avoid when encountering people.", "Aweh you're so kind and compassionate towards other people's lives realities. What a dear.", "bro have you fucking seen the world today. call me fucking crazy for not trusting people, you trust people you get hurt. youre hurting yourself bro. good for u nobodys ever fucked u over or hurt you but people hurt other people EVERY DAY THEY ARE LITERALLY PSYCHOS walking among us every day do you even watch true crime ?? do u watch the news ?? im so mindblown by your comment", "No it's not. Never had a SO make me get my own keys when moving in. \n\nIt's an issue becouse he has the keys that need ot be copied. Why is she supposed to ask him for his keys to get copied.", "And it's totally normal to have to ask for the key set to go have them copied /s. \n\nNo it's not I've never not been given keys when moving in. It's ridiculous to expect somone to ask you for your keys and go get them copied if your inviting them to move in.", "And to clarify no I'm actually trying to get op to respond lmao.", "I agree, but saying just get it started is not fair. You were there to guide your child through the process. Doing that as an adult with severe unmanaged adhd is not simple. It takes every bit of energy and focus you have to simply make a drs appointment. I remember sobbing in the middle of making my calls bc it was so overwhelming to do. \n\nI\u2019m not saying she should thrust her issues onto someone else, but instead of being a jerk and locking her in he could have gotten her a key and helped her find positive ways to manage until she can make that step. \n\nI was lucky to have people to assist me and support me or I would have never done it.", ">The insane thing is that she won't go get a set of keys so she can do that without putting either of them at ris\n\nYou cannot copy keys if you don't have keys in your possession. You don't go to a locksmith with a 'please make keys for \\[address\\]'. You go to a locksmith with a key and ask for a copy of said key.\n\nIf you don't have a key (like OP's GF does not have keys), you cannot copy them. She is completely dependent on OP to get a copy made.", "The previous owners built it in the 90s, and it was very 90s-esque.  They handed over the keys and it was like \"just let me get the wheelbarrow\" cause they had kept the original 4 copies of every key.", ">I have ADHD\n\nSo do I, so does my entire family. So do the kids at local schools I volunteer with, So do the adults constantly sent my way in my >1K tech company (Many of whom I have woken up at 8am to three way conference call their doctors with them).\n\nI don't just have experience having ADHD, or growing up in a houshold with 5 ADHD sufferers - I've spent 20 hours a week for over a decade acting as an ADHD sherpa and gotten hundreds of people onto treatment paths.\n\nHelping people with ADHD is my hyperfocus interest.", "Yeah, but she hasn't", "I didn't say she shouldn't have the key, but what I meant was her taking it in her night walks. In the middle of the the day a \"hey I'm going to make that copy, I'll be back in an hour\" is perfectly reasonable", "And then he tells people not to be afraid? Umm you seem to be exactly what others are afraid of?", "I'm actually a deer, because I'm gonna leave humans behind to eat berries and shit in the woods", "I think more of the issue is OP worries about her safety, while also putting him at risk by leaving the door unlocked at night time. If she has a key for the front door then I don't know why she doesn't ATLEAST go out the front, lock that, and bring a key. However, something tells me she isn't going to stop her nightly strolls and OP isn't going to get on board with them, sounds like a compatability issue. I personally wouldn't want my partner leaving at all hours while I'm asleep and not knowing they're out or back until I wake up when it might be too late if something bad happened. Everyone's entitled to what they like/don't like in a partner, especially if its happening in your home/causes anxiety for the other person involved.", "If there was any point ever when he said he was purposefully hiding or keeping the keys from her, you'd have a singular salient point. And I'd be on your side. But he isn't. He never remotely mentions that. Any basic reading comprehension would say that she simply hasn't gone to do it herself. She hasn't bothered to get the keys, go out, and have it remade. Literally says in the post that she hasn't bothered to herself\n\nKeep fishing for a reason to be pissed, maybe you'll find it one day", "Yeah, I don't believe that, based on all your comments here.\n\nHave the day you deserve.", "Mine too, to the point where I've studied it in pretty incredible and frustrating death. A process I forced myself through, having ADHD myself. So I agree that getting a diagnosis and treatment is very complicated and difficult. \n\nBut none of that affects being able to minimize the risks of the behaviour. You don't know what the neighborhood they're in is like, and you don't know the risks. I'm in a fairly secure area, and I still lock my door every night. Don't you?", "Because they're not her keys to copy.. they're his. Its on him to give her a set, not her to ask for them or have to remember to copy.", ">Yeah, I don't believe that\n\nOk - Am I supposed to care what you think?\n\n>Have the day you deserve.\n\nYou're a bit of an odd duck, eh?", ">and I still lock my door every night. Don't you?\n\nI forget all the time.\n\nLuckly burglers are like water - they take the path of least resistance. That isn't usually the house with the visible CCTV and motion lights.\n\nManaging ADHD usually means finding an alternate solution to achieve the same goal. I can forget to lock my door, I don't need to remember anything for my CCTV to be a deterrant.", "I was taught that the one who has the interest is the one who should take action. If she wants to go walking at 3 am she is the one that should ensure being able to lock the house. If she doesn't care about her own safety that's one thing, but he doesn't have to be at risk because of her carelessness and be the one to fix it for her"]}
