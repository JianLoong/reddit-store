{"id": 21208, "submission_id": "14pd3is", "title": "AITAH for \u201clocking\u201d my gf inside for her own good", "selftext": "\n(22M) So my gf (21F) has a bit of wanderlust. I\u2019m almost positive she has some form of ADHD because she is incredibly forgetful and at times careless. She\u2019ll do things like leave her purses, books, phone, and at times keys in the car. Boil an egg on the stove and only remember once the water has completely evaporated and is burning, as well as other appliance related problems. \n\nShe always talks about how she\u2019ll get around to getting diagnosed and medicated but never does. Apparently she\u2019s been like this her whole life. \nAnyways, we recently moved in together( a house that belonged to my grandmother but we both pay utilities/tax/bills) and it\u2019s been great honestly except for these little problems. The major point of contention rn is how she will at times leave through the back door, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT on \u201cwalks\u2019, and be gone for hours. We have had disagreements about this multiple times in the past where I\u2019ve told her that her walks are dangerous and make me uncomfortable. \n\nShe will leave at around 1 - 2 am to walk around our rural neighborhood for hours at a time, sometimes when her phone is on low battery. I have no idea why she does this. She\u2019s told me that it\u2019s \u201cexercise\u201d and she enjoys the solitude but it makes me uncomfortable af. I worry about what could happen in the middle of the night with no one around, and she doesn\u2019t appreciate me coming with her too much. Worse yet, she will leave the back door unlocked because she still hasn\u2019t gotten her own set of house keys. So it is up to me to readmit my wayward gf every few nights. \n\nI\u2019ve decide to draw my line. I\u2019ve refused to unlock the back door and had it locked from both ends so she\u2019s forced to use the front door for her trips. Not even she would dare leave the front door unlocked to go gallivanting into the night, so I\u2019m good on that end. The only thing is that she got incredibly frustrated at me and called me a controlling AH and hasn\u2019t been talking to me. I don\u2019t think I am when she refuses to behave like a literal sensible adult. \n\nSo yeah AITAH? I find it ridiculous cause she could simply go out to get her own pair of keys to thwart me, but she\u2019s the type that can\u2019t have too many errands on her mind. She will have a list of five and then feel overwhelmed and tapped out after completing one. I love her but she is insane.\n\nEdit: A-lot of people are questioning why I hadn\u2019t issued her a key immediately in a \u201clandlord-esque\u201d sense; well she\u2019s not my tenant. it\u2019s more like she came over so much that it devolved into her living with me. \nShe has problems with her parents so she decided to make my place her main residence, and we\u2019ve just been chilling like that. She offered to pay utilities and things, but tbh I wouldn\u2019t have minded either way. So finally picking up an extra set of keys was on our to do list that she insisted she could handle. \n\nStill, I feel I was a bit assholey in how I chose to handle this. Her possible ADHD is a big issue for her and I\u2019ve employed a hands off approach in order to leave her agency, but since it\u2019s come to this it\u2019s obviously not working. We\u2019re definitely going to figure out other ways to work through this, including  helping her make appts and finally start the process on her diagnosis. She\u2019s also suggested sharing her location when she goes for walks and informing me before she leaves each time. Looking into electronic locks and - We\u2019re going to go get her copies of the keys later today. \n\nAlso no, she does not have a secret lover that she\u2019s hitchhiking to go rendezvous with each night.\n\nSome comments from my gf: i am not a cat.", "created_utc": 1688372812, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14pd3is/aitah_for_locking_my_gf_inside_for_her_own_good/", "score": 6104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would go out at midnight, 1am, 2am. Have a lovely long nighttime walk, felt at peace with the world, and loves the solitude.\n\nI did, however, always bring a fully charged phone from which I could easily call for help. Plus I locked my flat like a normal person. I also had an app where my family could see my location (though they lived in a different city and I didn't tell them about my nighttime strolls).\n\nOh, and I also have ADHD.\n\nJust sharing cos she could actually just be enjoying a nighttime stroll.\n\nEDIT: apparently this is now a top-level comment and I'm required to make a judgement. I say NAH, because your gf isn't doing anything bad or wrong and you're not actually locking her in the house if she can leave via the front door.\n\n Clearly though both of you have things to work on: you have to recognise it's your responsibility to give her a set of keys and not her responsibility to get yours copied (like wtf is that), and she needs to acquiesce to some safety points to make sure you don't worry, like always having full charge on her phone, having a rape whistle on her, or some other such compromise between you.", "NTA - you're not locking her in. She can get in and out perfectly fine, just not through the door she'd prefer. Besides, she like exercise so walking a few extra steps to use the front door shouldn't be a problem.", "NTA\n\nHer doing that is a safety hazard not just for herself but her home. \n\nAnd, she can still go through the front door so OP has not locked her in. If she so chooses not to go through the front door then that\u2019s on her. \nI don\u2019t think him locking it is something that should happen. But, these aren\u2019t normal circumstances and OP does state she is extremely forgetful.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine why she does this, and I do think a conversation about what causes this is necessary. It\u2019s probably better for her to speak to a therapist if willing. \n\nAnd, I can understand people just have their quirks but this is oddly specific of an action to do consistently.", "NTA. What\u2019s wrong w all of the commenters saying he\u2019s controlling?? She is objectively doing an extremely unsafe thing, and also endangering other people by forgetting to lock the door. There is no way she\u2019s stupid enough to not realize how it\u2019s not safe to go on hour long walks at 2 in the morning with a dying phone; besides, he\u2019s also brought it up to her many times. It would be one thing if she\u2019s just clueless, but she\u2019s knowingly disregarding HER safety, HIS safety, and HIS valid discomfort just to engage in her dangerous walks, which is honestly extremely selfish imo. He literally bought her a taser and she still forgets it!  He\u2019s done everything he can to make sure to accommodate her walks, to help her be safer and also to alleviate his justifiable concerns, and yet she still refuses to make any changes. She is aware she may have ADHD and this is why she is forgetful yet she does nothing to fix that despite knowing her ADHD-induced behavior is dangerous to herself and her boyfriend and makes him justifiably worried??\n\nShe is obviously aware of the dangers of leaving doors unlocked because she won\u2019t do it with the front door. Her refusing to do it with the back door is frankly, her just being unempathetic to her boyfriends rightful concerns + lazy. \n\nAlso, if she so desperately wants to walk she can literally just get her own keys. But no, once again, her ADHD causes her to be forgetful and she is fully aware of the need to treat it, is fully capable of seeking that treatment, but refuses to and instead just obliviously and selfishly does things that\u2019s not good for her or her bf. OP is not forbidding her to go on walks or physically preventing her from doing so. He is not controlling.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not saying she can just magically fix her ADHD, I am saying that she is aware of (literally has openly acknowledged!) that she should get a diagnosis and treatment yet she hasn\u2019t done that, at both her own and her bf\u2019s expense. And y\u2019all I\u2019ve been in an actually controlling relationship where my partner would use the guise of safety to be extremely abusive and disrespectful \u2014 this man isn\u2019t doing that. He has provided her with compromises (taser) and has obviously tried to be understanding about her need for these walks for a long time, him locking the doors now is clearly a last resort because she has refused to ever be more responsible. Yes sure he can refrain from \u201ccontrolling\u201d her behavior and just leave her instead, but in the real world we don\u2019t live under these black and white mental health and relationship guidelines, humans will naturally try to stop the people they love from doing unsafe things while still wanting to stay with the people they love.", "INFO: Does she live here? If so, why does she not already have keys?", "NAH,\n\nBut I can\u2019t help thinking there is something else going on here. There is to many unaccountable factors that don\u2019t make sense in terms of normal everyday behaviour and skills (task management, memory, risk management and probably others). \n\nSeriously, I don\u2019t think you have an AITA kind of problem here. I think you might have a \u201cI think my girlfriend might need to see a GP for a discussion and further testing\u201d problem.", "How controlling to make her \"leave through the front door\" and \"not leave the house unlocked while you're sleeping in the middle of the night\". \n\nWhew! I'm not sure society could function if we all had to live by these barbaric limitations. /s\n\nNTA. About the 3rd time I found out I was sleeping in an unlocked house she would have been asked to change or move out. Two things not to fuck around with so you don't find out.  Sleep quality and leaving the doors open forbthe thieves and murderers of the world.\n\nThe walking is dangerous, but as long as you're not risking my life too... have at it I guess.", "I recognize a lot of behaviour from my ADHD daughter. It helps if she is on medication.\n\nFor other things, structural solutions will help. Such as:\n\n\\- Replace the lock on the backdoor with one that automatically falls in the lock.\n\n\\- Accept that she is an adult and gets to weigh the risks and benefits of nightly walks herself. Maybe you can discuss mitigation, such as wearing a whistle and an iWatch.\n\n\\- Make sure she has good noise cancelling headphones.\n\n\\- Make sure you have good smoke detectors.\n\n\\- Invest in appliances that will either stop when done, or make noise (such as an egg steamer).", "No judgement because it's such a non-issue if you just get her a set of keys. When you're both free go get her a set of keys cut, problem solved. She probably likes the solitude of walking at night as it's quiet and less busy, especially if she has ADHD.  It might also be worth asking her if she wants you to help her start the ball rolling with the diagnosis process because task initiation for ADHDers can be a massive problem.", "Lol, you moved in with someone that will burn down your house sooner or later bc she can't be bothered to remember the stove? And you think her leaving the back door unlocked in the middle of the night is the main problem here?", "INFO: This all hinges on the key situation. If you have keys, isn't it on you to go make copies for her? Why is it not done? Why was she not given keys on the day she moved in? If you went out of your way to change the lock on the back door, it surely must have come with 2 keys like any normal lock. \n\nShe sounds like a mess but you don't sound any better.", "Info - why did you not just get her a set of housekeys or let her use yours?", "I had an ex-boyfriend who would leave in the middle of the night and go for these walks and disappear and really worry me. He was the same age and turns out he was developing schizophrenia. Maybe not the case with your girlfriend because schizophrenia is more common in males but just putting that out there", "NTA  You can get locks that automatically lock but only use fingerprint to unlock it. Your GF would never have to worry about remembering keys. Do you really see this relationship as long term since she refuses to get help? What if you ever have a child together? Aren't you worried that she'd forget about the child at times? You say she is more forgetful when overwhelmed, babies can be quite overwhelming at times. You might want to rethink this relationship until she gets help.", "ESH \n\n\nThis is a really weird dynamic \n\n\nShe has every right to go for late night walks no matter what your feelings are on the subject, she's an adult\n\n\nYou have every right to sleep in a locked house\n\n\nHowever, rather than deal with the issue by making sure she locks the door, you have childishly made her use the door she doesn't have a key for (for some reason)", "NTA.

NTA", "NTA\nYou are looking out for her safety, it is so dangerous to go out alone in the middle of the night.", "Is your girlfriend a cat ?", "The forgetfulness is relatable, I also have ADHD that\u2019s not medicated because I\u2019m trying to find a medication that doesn\u2019t give me chronic migraines. But the insistence on wandering around at unsafe hours with a dying phone and also insisting on going out a specific door? I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s ADHD related. Risk taking is common with ADHD but that\u2019s more impulsive, not planned nightly outings at the same time. It\u2019s also super weird that she doesn\u2019t want you with her. If she has excess energy to burn off, there are safer ways. If she needs to clear her head, there are safer ways. She\u2019s also putting your safety at risk if she doesn\u2019t lock the door, and she\u2019s being inconsiderate by causing you anxiety due to her risky behavior. If she won\u2019t stop, or won\u2019t give a reasonable explanation, she is showing you that your feelings are not a priority for her. Something to note is that alcohol and drug abuse is a very very common occurrence for people with ADHD. As are eating disorders. It certainly seems like that could be what\u2019s happening here, and she might be hiding it from you due to shame or something else.

My grandfather nearly killed us all by leave the gas on unlit. Please get her assessed asap.", "NTA, and I think it\u2019s time for an ultimatum.

Would she be able to leave the house?\n\nIf she can still go out the front door and lock it behind her, then I can\u2019t see the problem. \n\nBut she should have a key so she can get in and out of the house through the front door whenever she likes.\n\nWe live in a fairly safe area, but there have been break-ins\n\nYesterday we (me, my daughter 42, my son 38) went to a local event where our troupe were dancing. Whilst there my son bumped into his mate and so we left him there chatting whilst they caught up and then went for a drink together. I rang my son at 10:30pm as I suspected that he didn\u2019t have keys. He didn\u2019t. He was still drinking and as it would have taken him 30-45 minutes to walk home (I suspected that he wouldn\u2019t leave for at least another hour) I agreed to leave the back door unlocked.\n\nI actually feel safer with the front door locked when I am asleep.\n\nAnd if I can\u2019t sleep, I have been known to go out in the early hours to enjoy the night air.

It\u2019s clearly been some time now from the way you talk about the issue and she still doesn\u2019t have a key. And now instead of finding a rational solution you\u2019ve chosen to effectively block her from doing what you don\u2019t want her to do. \n\nThere are plenty of innocent reasons to take late night walks. I do this myself when I have bouts of insomnia. This is an excellent situation for the two of you to practice respect and compromise. For example, a compromise might be: you get her a set of keys and she makes an appointment to get evaluated for her possible ADHD. You both do those things today. A further compromise might be you recognising that you can\u2019t stop her from going for these walks, but you can find a safer way to do it. Maybe you keep a charged power bank by the back door and ask her to take it and to turn on location sharing when she goes for these walks. That way you know where she is and that she\u2019s got a charged phone. It allows her the freedom she is entitled to, and gives you some peace of mind.", "YTA...first..get her a set of keys. Second...she is not a child that you can keep at home, if she wants to walk during the evening is her right. She is an adult.

I\u2019m almost positive she has some form of ADHD because she is incredibly forgetful and at times careless. She\u2019ll do things like leave her purses, books, phone, and at times keys in the car. Boil an egg on the stove and only remember once the water has completely evaporated and is burning, as well as other appliance related problems. \n\nShe always talks about how she\u2019ll get around to getting diagnosed and medicated but never does. Apparently she\u2019s been like this her whole life. \nAnyways, we recently moved in together( a house that belonged to my grandmother but we both pay utilities/tax/bills) and it\u2019s been great honestly except for these little problems. The major point of contention rn is how she will at times leave through the back door, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT on \u201cwalks\u2019, and be gone for hours. We have had disagreements about this multiple times in the past where I\u2019ve told her that her walks are dangerous and make me uncomfortable. \n\nShe will leave at around 1 - 2 am to walk around our rural neighborhood for hours at a time, sometimes when her phone is on low battery. I have no idea why she does this. She\u2019s told me that it\u2019s \u201cexercise\u201d and she enjoys the solitude but it makes me uncomfortable af. I worry about what could happen in the middle of the night with no one around, and she doesn\u2019t appreciate me coming with her too much. Worse yet, she will leave the back door unlocked because she still hasn\u2019t gotten her own set of house keys. So it is up to me to readmit my wayward gf every few nights. \n\nI\u2019ve decide to draw my line. I\u2019ve refused to unlock the back door and had it locked from both ends so she\u2019s forced to use the front door for her trips. Not even she would dare leave the front door unlocked to go gallivanting into the night, so I\u2019m good on that end. The only thing is that she got incredibly frustrated at me and called me a controlling AH and hasn\u2019t been talking to me. I don\u2019t think I am when she refuses to behave like a literal sensible adult. \n\nSo yeah AITAH? I find it ridiculous cause she could simply go out to get her own pair of keys to thwart me, but she\u2019s the type that can\u2019t have too many errands on her mind. She will have a list of five and then feel overwhelmed and tapped out after completing one. I love her but she is insane.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Who welcomes their partner into living with them and doesn\u2019t provide a key? At least when it\u2019s a house (not an apartment where additional keys may need to come from the landlord). It sounds more like he doesn\u2019t want her to have house keys, since she tends to leave keys in places that she shouldn\u2019t, so he\u2019s put it on her to get them knowing that she won\u2019t.\n\nShe definitely needs to get diagnosed and treated, of course. She\u2019s a risk to their home and him, as well as herself, the way that she is.", "Why hasn't  **HE** made the key? She can't do it without his key, so really it's up to him, not her to do it unless she steals his key to make a copy.", "This isn't weaponized incompetence. This is a situation where she probably doesn't think the issue is as big of a deal as her partner does, because instead of talking to her about it like a mature adult, he's silently engaging in mind games like \"I won't make a copy of the key for her until she asks for the keys\" or \"I'm going to lock her in the house without telling her to keep her going from walks I don't approve of.\"\n\nIf OP doesn't like his girlfriend, he should break up with her.", "But she has to ask and have him go with her and it seems there is a bit of a control issue going on. When I moved in with my boyfriend the very first thing he did was give me a spare key. I didn\u2019t need to ask him for it and he certainly didn\u2019t have trust issues about my ability to borrow his key and go make a copy. This is a weird dynamic. I don\u2019t know what the answer is, but locking the door and knowing it\u2019s enough to prevent your GF from doing what she would enjoy doing is controlling. Controlling your partner because you think they can\u2019t take care of themselves is not healthy.", "How can you copy a key you don't have??", "It actually does sound like he\u2019s preventing her from getting a copy of the key. IMO, it\u2019s the key holder\u2019s responsibility to make a copy. Not the person who doesn\u2019t have access to the key. \n\nY\u2019all really need to work on reading between the lines. Yes, the girlfriend has some questionable judgment, but OP is manipulating and controlling the situation.", "I think using the term weaponised incompetence is inappropriate in this situation. She\u2019s neurodivergent - it\u2019s hard for anyone to pursue medical diagnosis, but she faces additional challenges. Also, trialling medications and accepting your identity are both gruelling aspects - and while adhd meds do have positive evidence for efficacy, they likely will not \u2018fix\u2019 her.\n\nNot getting a key isn\u2019t weaponised incompetence either - that\u2019s straight up ADHD. I understand what you\u2019re trying to say, but I think it mischaracterises neurodivergence.\n\nAlso. The OP is using his girlfriend\u2019s limitations to control whether she goes out of not. Yes she \u2018could\u2019 get a key - but, and this is very hard for neurotypical people to understand - she actually can\u2019t. Or it will take her time. She\u2019s facing some kind of blockage and she needs her partner\u2019s support - not for him to say - well if toy just got a key you could move around freely! Which, he clearly stated he didn\u2019t want her walking at night. So he is being controlling. He needs to communicate with her, but not lock her in.", "You support fearful people making decisions for those less in fear. That's what your comment reads as", "Yeah, so much about this is a head scratcher. Why does she need to walk for hours in the middle of the night?

She needs to get herself sorted with a doctor, and start  that process soon!", "Because HE is the one WHO HAS THEM.", "Does he carry around the only key? If so, it\u2019s much easier for him to do it.", "He needs to give her access to the key for that to happen.

Reverse engineer the internals of the lock and bring the numbers to a locksmith?\n\nTo make copies, she needs to have the key in her hands, which she doesn't.", "Because she doesn't have any keys to copy?", "This! I had a set of keys ready for my BF as soon as he moved in with me", "This is what I\u2019ve been wondering the whole time", "I brought my set of keys to a professional key smith person (however they are called). I got them back 2 minutes and a few jokes later. And it just costed 7\u20ac or something per key.", "Yup, I have ADHD, but I\u2019m the one that got keys made for my husband and I when we moved in together.\n\nYou need extras, so I don\u2019t see how this is an individual task.  Seems extremely inefficient.", "The most generous interpretation is that he thinks he can \u201cconsequence\u201d her into doing tasks he sees as basic adult tasks.\n\nHe\u2019s going to be bitterly disappointed when he discovers it\u2019s impossible to parent an already grown human.", "This is the correct answer", "i'd be much more scared to walk in a rural area than a well-lit, populated city centre.", "My fianc\u00e9s brother and SIL live in a kinda rural area right off the highway.

Being inconvenienced or annoyed by someone else's disability is not an excuse to be controlling, abusive, and manipulative. \n\nStaying with her and abusing her is not the only choice here.", "It's nothing like that. Thre are a couple of things going on that make ADHD really fucking hard to live with. It's essentially a disorder of fucked up neurotransmitters, especially dopamine, which is involved in a lot of basic reward and emotional pathways.\n\nOne of the major ones is executive dysfunction. That means day to day simple tasks - remembering to do basic shit. The best explanation of the problem I ever heard of this is that it's like a chemical reaction that has a huge activation energy. You know you need to do the thing. Your brain is yelling at you to do the thing. The thing isn't hard. But in neurotyoical people, starting the thing isn't hard. They have whatever enzyme is needed to lower the activation energy of that chemical reaction. If you don't have that, though ... The amount of effort it takes to just *start* doing a dumb fucking ESSENTIAL FOR LIFE task like \"invoice for all the work you did\" or \"clean a dish\" or \"brush your teeth\" is like asking someone to climb Everest. We routinely forget to pay rent and bills, take care of basic hygiene tasks, clean our spaces ... It's a nightmare.\n\nADHD is also strongly associated with hyperfocus. Once something crosses that activation energy, we pour an enormous amount of focus into it. Things like the need to eat or do something else or even pay attention to the passage of time don't get through. When we ARE productive, we can be insanely so. Unfortunately we don't get to choose our hyperfocuses and \"scrolling Reddit\" can just as easily be the thing that triggers it as \"doing your job that you need to live.\" It's ridiculously hard to break out of. Emotional hyperfocus can also be a thing - when you're angry or happy, those are the only things you feel, and that little voice in your head that says \"I'm angry with my partner but I still love him\" doesn't EXIST. You're just angry. That's *all* you are in the moment.\n\nThe thing that people ASSOCIATE with ADHD is fidgeting and hyperactivity. If you're neurotypical, constant squirming, fidgeting, doodling instead of note taking, etc, are all signs that you're not invested in what's going on, and that you don't care. Studies of people with ADHD show that this is absolutely not the case - physical activity like squirming is associated with concentration and memory. It looks like we're \"not paying attention,\" when we are, in fact, at our most attentive. Being asked to sit still is a fucking nightmare that directly impacts our ability to focus. \n\nFinally, ADHD is associated strongly with something called \"rejection sensitive dysphoria.\" This is essentially the normal human fear of rejection dialed up to a thousand. If someone says something that we perceive as rejection, it can feel like a physical \"my life is in danger\" fight or flight response? Your boyfriend just said your shirt looks weird? Welcome to an hour of uncontrollable sobbing and very literally feeling like your heart has been cut out. It's exhausting and awful for you and anyone you care about.", "Just ADHD now, ADD was dropped. It's an executive function disorder, and most people hear that and can't really put a finger on the underlying meaning. Executive function is comprised of time awareness and management, emotional self-awareness, inhibition and self-restraint, self-motivation, working memory, and finally, planning.\n\nAdhd may impact one, many, or all of these skills in a way that impacts quality of life. It can look like forgetfulness, rudeness, carelessness, disregard for others' time, disregard for rules and structure, laziness, or apathy. It can be socially crippling, and can make life feel like the world just wasn't built for you to live in.\n\nTop this off with increased mortality rates, a veritable laundry list of common comorbiddities, and a propensity for making rash, life altering decisions. Treatment is locked behind a lengthy diagnosis process that starts sufferers at a huge disadvantage if they weren't diagnosed as a child.\n\nWhat it's like day to day?

How she does things and forgets things. This is directly related to how her brain is wired and how ADHD manifests itself.

You are attempting to curtail her activities because you blame her for not getting a key, instead of getting her a key made. Instead of working with her to ensure that her phone is charged, or that you set up her phone to know where she is and to map a safe route with her at night.  Some of those rural roads can be really dark and they don't have sidewalks. You could also invest in some gear like a headlamp, or a high visibility vest so she can be seen and see when it's that dark out.  Instead, you just rather she do what you want.  She may really need that time to herself at night with that decrease in stimulation to help her as a coping mechanism.  Research ADHD. Find ways to adapt to her situation vs. trying to control it.

The reason he hasn\u2019t just made her a copy of the key is because at this point it\u2019s about the principle of the matter. She wants to go on walks, she needs to do the errand of getting keys made, because she DOES understand why she shouldn\u2019t leave the door unlocked. He\u2019s likely fed up with having to walk her through things that need to be done. Everyone voting Y T A cause he has the keys is acting like he\u2019s an old timey crook twirling his mustache and always keeps his keys on him even when he\u2019s sleeping, she can take the keys with her to get copies made if she\u2019d ask I\u2019m sure. I have ADHD bad, my partner had ADHD bad, and we\u2019d have to do stuff like OP is doing occasionally because your memory is shit when you\u2019re not directly looking at the problem.

OP, if you love her and want to stay with her, her mental state needs to be a hardline issue. By all accounts it sounds like ADHD, which is harder to get a diagnosis for if you\u2019re AFAB so the process should be started ASAP, but others have mentioned that it could be something entirely different, which is even more reason to get assessed. This might be difficult and require you to basically handhold your way through it because the more urgent the task the stronger the urge is to put it off or ignore it, intentionally or not, so you might want to have a sit down and explain just how much her behavior not only affects you but herself, and if she refuses to change you have to ask yourself if you want the relationship to continue. I\u2019ve seen people excuse her lack of diagnosis with the time it takes to get diagnosed but I had a single psych eval over the phone and was diagnosed, total wait time was a month for that appointment. \n\nADHD aside, it sounds like you\u2019ve expressed concern on many behaviors many different times and she still refuses to change her behavior or compromise so I can understand your frustration. Your reasoning for not wanting her to walk late at night does come across as controlling, even though you have valid reasons for concern the biggest threat to humans at night for the most part is other humans so being rural does help in that regard. It might be good for you if you\u2019re asking her to change to do self reflection as well, and ask yourself if there\u2019s anything inside you that you or her might want to do differently. It\u2019s important to remember that in relationships it should be both of you against a problem, not you vs her, so try to take a step back from the emotions, difficult I know, and try to see things as objectively as possible. Also, just so you\u2019re aware, people with neurodivergence tend to attract each other, so it might be good for you to assess your own behaviors and run down the list of executive functions to see if you yourself might have ADHD, there\u2019s more to it than attention span and forgetfulness. There\u2019s time blindness, which can cause you to over or underestimate time left till a certain point, task initiation and completion which are separate functions like having proper motivation to start a task and having motivation to finish a given task (like washing/drying the laundry but leaving it unfolded).

If you ask your partner to take out the trash every day, and they fail to do it every day, and you yell at them about it every day, you aren't looking for a solution, you are just taking out frustration on someone who doesn't have ability to do what you want them to do. It's wrapped up in our society's view of laziness. OP sees his GF as lazy for not getting the keys made, so he sees it as fair that his response involves punishing her (by not allowing night time walks until it's done).

Like yesterday, I needed to take dishes to the kitchen and do them, and also bring my suitcase (which was in the entryway right next to the kitchen) to the laundry room (which is right next to my office where the dishes were piling up), and unpack and wash everything in it. \n\nSo like it makes sense to bundle them together and utilize the return trips to make everything more efficient, right? \n\nBut for some reason that tripped a Too Complex alarm in my brain and suddenly I just like...could not make myself do either thing. I stayed stuck until I made one of my exhaustive lists that looked something like:\n\n- Gather dishes from all surfaces in the office - grab an empty Amazon box from the pile and dump the dishes in there bc it's too many to carry at once - take the Amazon box of dishes upstairs to the kitchen - unload the dishes into the sink - break the Amazon box down and put it in the kitchen cardboard bin - grab suitcase from the entryway - bring it downstairs and to the bedroom (there's nowhere in the laundry room to set it down and go thru it) - unpack it and set aside the couple of tops that weren't worn and don't need washed - gather up everything else and carry it to the laundry room - start the laundry - go back to the bedroom and put away those couple of tops - put the suitcase in the back of the closet - go back upstairs - put away the clean dishes in the drying rack - wash the dishes I just brought up. \n\nWhich helped, because now it's a clear set of instructions instead of a nebulous cloud of subtasks needing done to accomplish the two goals of \"unpack and do laundry\" and \"get the dishes out of the office and wash them\", but it's also now a really long to-do list. \n\nI get around that part of it by using Now Do This - you enter your list and hit go, and it holds onto the whole list but only displays the next task so you don't see the whole list, only what you need to do now.\n\nBut when I look at it in light of your multiplicative difficulty scaling analogy, suddenly it makes a ton more sense why I got so hardcore stuck on doing those two things yesterday.\n\n(I did eventually get the unpacking and laundry part done.
