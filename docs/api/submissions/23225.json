{"id": 23225, "submission_id": "15aoha0", "title": "AITA for stealing a toy back from my niece?", "selftext": "So the title sucks I get that but let me explain. I don\u2019t care for my niece 8f. I 30sf have a different parenting style then my sil 30sf and bro 40sm. \nRecently my niece was over and saw some toys I purchased for my kids birthday that was coming up. I got a few novelty little people sets. They were friends, golden girls, Harry Potter and the office. Well my niece immediately noticed them in the corner of my den and wanted to play with them. I told her no that once her cousin opened them for her birthday that weekend she could play with them then. Of course my niece threw a fit but I ignored her and continued making dinner. That night after everyone went home my spouse went to wrap the gifts for me. He came into our room holding 3 sets asking about the 4th. Puzzled I looked at him and followed him Into the den and saw that indeed the friends box was missing. This was the one my niece was most excited about. The following day I ran by my brothers house using the excuse to drop off some mail and snooping in my nieces room. Of course sitting by her bed was the friends box partially opened but all the pieces were inside. I grabbed the box after taking a photo, dumped the mail on the counter and went home. Cue today my kids party, my niece lost it when she saw my daughter open all 4 sets. My sil had a puzzled look on her face but didn\u2019t say anything else. After my daughter opened her gifts I put everything inside the house in the master room behind a locking door. When I went inside my sil followed asking where I got the friends box I turned and told her I knew they took it to their home but I took it back as I rightfully purchased it. She flew off the handle of how dare I take something from her home. I told her to shut up I had proof either her or my niece stole my daughters gift when I refused to let her play with it and that if she continued with her tantrum I would be telling my bro and family what she did. She got a sour look on her face and left the party shortly after. Later family asked about a rumor that I stole a gift from sils home so I set the story straight and laid out exactly what she did with photo proof. Now my bro is pissed at his wife but also at me claiming I stooped to her level when I could of just told him what was going on. So AITA?\n\nEdit: I just spoke with my brother. He called and asked to meet for a beer. Apparently sil and him are divorcing. My niece took the toy and my sil knew about it that night but told my niece she could keep it as I wouldn\u2019t remember that one is missing. My brother is absolutely mortified that my sil and niece did this. Thing is if my niece asked for it my brother would of bought it no questions asked. I apologized to him for entering his home under different circumstances and offered his key back. He called me an idiot and hugged me telling me he would of done the exact same thing if he was in my position. \n\nFrom what he told me my sil has had an unhealthy obsession/ resentment towards me from the start of their relationship which has boiled down to their child. I did apologize and offer any help and support to him and my niece. My brother did joking suggest I take my niece for the rest of summer to straighten her behavior out. My brother and I were raised by our grandparents as we had absent/abusive parents. He has tried to overcompensate for our rough childhood which has resulted a spoilt arrogant child. I may take his offer to try to help my niece. She used to be very sweet up until 2 years ago when my brother started working more and taking more work trips. I did suggest therapy for him and my niece.", "created_utc": 1690422404, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15aoha0/aita_for_stealing_a_toy_back_from_my_niece/", "score": 212, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her reaction perhaps explains why your niece behaves the way she does.", "NTA. I understand why you did it that way. By talking directly to your brother, your SIL can just deny everything and throw the toy away.
