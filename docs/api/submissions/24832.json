She left me after brief fling and started dating another guy in town.   She is pregnant and the couple tells everyone for 8 months its his child... 8 months later I get letter from her and she tells me she thinks I might be the dad...  She breaks off with other guy and we decide to work on relationship.     I'm supporting her and take a distant job making more money to help support.  I'm committed, working on relationship, we talk about marriage.  As we date, we figure out we are two different people.  After 12 months she gives me back engagement ring,  She grows distant and cuts off communication.  (Turns out she is pregnant with another mans child.)   I have no more contact despite attempts for 6 months.    She wouldn't take phone calls or meet with me.  She would leave with child and avoid me when I come to visit.   Her mom is one to tell me she met another guy and is marrying him.    I was in a dead end relationship and I moved on...  \n\nFast forward 28 years.   Me; happily married with wife and 3 kids. Her adult son reaches out to my adult child on FB and says I'm his dad.  It was quite a shock for our kids...  My wife knew about it before we got married but we decided to not tell our kids until we needed to cross that bridge.   I met with him, we confirmed with DNA, and started working on relationship.   He was at low point in life with no money, no job, and no direction.    He had traumatic childhood with a revolving door of men in home with no father figure.    His mom had 5 kids with at least 4 men. Son has Alcohol and anxiety issues. He would call occasionally drunk in middle of night and vent emotional baggage of growing up without a dad.  I made myself available to talk any time.  I helped him financially, covered apartment for several months, and provided him employment.  He asked me to pay off his college debt for associates degree of @$30K to which I told him I wouldn't hand over a check but would help him pay it off by helping him earn money to pay off debt.   At work he was often late, showed up hungover, didn't produce much work product, and he quit. Twice.     Since then he has moved to different city, I rarely hear from him despite frequently calling and leaving phone and text messages.   I spoke to him about not staying in touch and he said we don't have anything in common and he just doesn't have anything to say to me.   Its been emotional drain on me and source of friction with my wife.   I'm torn between trying to be the father figure I wasn't for his first 28 years not wanting to let go; or just accepting that I cant change his opinions and letting go. \n\n  ", "created_utc": 1692243261, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15tblo6/aita_for_not_paying_off_debts_for_son_who_showed/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like your son lacks accountability and uses lack of a father figure to justify this. You gave him several opportunities to fix his life, and he hasn\u2019t taken advantage of any of them. \n\nWhat you did was very commendable, and making him actually work to pay off his debt is a much less enabling approach than handing him a 30K check. You can lead a horse to the water, but you cannot make it drink", "NTA - it's not like you were even given a chance to be a dad. Not much you can do. Going into 30k debt for an associates is so rough though.", "NTA\n\nYou gave it your best shot.  He clearly doesn\u2019t give a shit enough about his own life to put in any effort.  He\u2019s old enough to know better.  He\u2019s not 20.  If he walked away then that\u2019s that.  Focus on the family that you do have, they\u2019re the ones that are there.", "I guess he wanted the money, not the relationship. You tried to help him in a meaningful way without causing harm to your own family. NTA.", "Some people don't want to take accountability in life, if I was 30k in debt and my dad told me he'd help me find good work to pay it off, I'd jump all over it. At some point he needs to be a big boy.", "He watched mom dodge accountability for years. So no surprise where he gets it from.", "NTA. He just wanted the money. Let it go. You tried. Send him a text to check on occasion to leave the door open but I wouldn\u2019t push. He\u2019s an adult who can make his own decisions.", "NTA. You can\u2019t fix him and he doesn\u2019t want a relationship. Be there for him emotionally but no longer financially until and if he gets his life together.", "ESH\n\nI think YTA (or at least who you were 26 years ago is) for not being there for him in any capacity either as a father, emotional support, or financially. It sounds like you probably could have made his life better by being a source of stability for him. \n\nI don\u2019t necessarily think giving him 30K to pay off debts is necessarily the right move. His life seems pretty dysfunctional and while paying off his debts might help him in some small way. Its not really the kind of help he needs. I think the kind of help you\u2019re giving is more in line with what he needs. And I think continuing to try to help him turn his life around is probably the best thing you can do. And trying to be there for him is also good. But to some extent the damage is done. \n\nHe\u2019s a mess and he\u2019s an asshole for not taking the great opportunities you gave him seriously.", "NTA. You tried and by your account have done what you could to support him. He needs to help himself as well. A relationship goes both ways and you met him half way.  \n\nPlease do not damage your current relationships with your family for a son who won't even try.", "Maybe I missed the part where you gave him 18 years of back child support?", "Why didn't you take his mother to court to get custody or ever check in on him?  \n\nHe's going to have a sad life that could have been so much different if you were in his life as a kid.  The least you could do is pay off his college debt.", "ESH, but mostly your ex.  It sounds like he's an alcoholic and he needs help and guidance, but he's 28 and won't just become responsible overnight now that you're in touch.\n\nKeep reaching out to him. What you did trying to help with a job was the right thing to do. Send him messages weekly. Just letting him know you're thinking of him and hope he's doing well. If he needs to talk, try to treat him more like a friend or younger coworker than your son. You didn't raise him, so it would be hard to step into a dad role now.", "\u201cHer adult child\u2026\u201d YTA", "it\u2019s nice that you\u2019ve been trying but i don\u2019t understand why a father wouldn\u2019t try anything and everything to be there for his son, go to court for custody, pay child support. Idk if it\u2019s totally reasonable to ask for you to pay his debts upfront but i see where he\u2019s coming from and you have to be accountable for not being involved- no matter what the mother was doing i think you should\u2019ve made the effort and done whatever u possibly could\u2019ve. YTA but it\u2019s a complicated situation.", "As someone who grew up without a father I can relate to the rough childhood and trauma associated with it. That being said life isn\u2019t fair there\u2019s a point where everyone has to stop feeling sorry for themselves and be adults because that\u2019s what we all have to do. I hate working I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a job I\u2019d love other then hanging out with my kids full time but I do it because it\u2019s my responsibility.\n\nKudos to you for reaching out and trying to reconcile your relationship with your son, I haven\u2019t spoke to my father in 20 years now to do drug abuse and always wished just to have some sort of relationship with him again. The fact you went and tried to help him financially ontop of emotionally says a lot about your character, you can try and help but it\u2019s his own life to live.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
