HELL NO, you'd offer to help him get to the pool so he could try swimming or at least encourage his own efforts to do so.\n\nI think this story is very similar.

At this point he needs to learn accountability and if your help isn't working, he does need an outside counselor. He may need accommodations from the schools he is applying, as well. If he has a diagnosis, his doctor can get sign off on a accommodation plan. I hope he can get the help he needs.", "Sounds like you both need to read up on ADHD, and he needs to find treatment for it.  His rigidity, like the way he was stuck on what he thought about the application process and his inability to adapt to the changing information, is really common in people with ADHD.  \n\nI think maybe he could manage a phd since he's interested and already completed an undergrad and masters, but only if he can get treatment for his adhd.  At this point, these problems you mentioned above will hold him back in most other careers he might persue too.", "I think that's a misunderstanding on your part on how ADHD works. Folks with ADHD usually have an impossible time remembering and paying attention to things they find boring and tedious. When it comes to things they're interested and curious about, they often find it impossible to stop focusing on and analyzing every detail. He's not forgetting basic info because it was different from expexted, it's because he can't remember boring, tedious details. Schools also accommodate people with disabilities whether they're getting their masters or a PhD. It also seems like instead of trying to help him stay organized, you just nagged him about various aspects of the application process.

Now comes the time to perform actual research; even if it does not turn out how he expected, it is information he gathered and worked for. He will, of course, remember that.

The person who can memorize or remember details can be argued they don't completely understand what they committed to memory. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a way to give him the help you want to give him without crushing his dreams. Let the University and staff do that. He doesn't complete the application; he is not getting into the program. He doesn't do the work for his research; he fails. He is a grown man and needs to fail, so let him. Then support him but go over where he fell short; he already knows his faults.

When you're sincerely trying to help someone, you approach things from a position of good faith.\n\nIf you're aware that someone has a problem that causes them to repeat the mistakes, you don't show your frustration and remind them that they're making the same mistake again. You assist them with putting systems in place to reduce the occurrence of those issues.\n\nIf someone expresses doubts over achieving their dream, the immediate response shouldn't be to encourage them to quit. The part being ignored in all of this is that you cannot do a PhD without other academic qualifications. Presumably he was able to show enough discipline to get a degree and masters. A supportive person would assist him with the application process and finding out whether or not there were alternative means of applying. \n\nThe way that she is behaving is perverse. It is not unlike, although obviously less severe, the girl who encouraged her boyfriend to commit suicide when he started to feel doubts. You unfortunately have nasty people in the world who prey on the vulnerable and try and sugarcoat attacks and acts of kindness.", "It\u2019s a TERRIBLE quality for someone who wants to do medical research, of all things.

Soft yta", "I feel like you're seeing the worst in people, where personally I'm not. I'm not detecting any malice in her post. When you're in a relationship with someone, and your lives are entwined, having your partner head in a bad direction can have negative consequences for both parties - of course, one should always be very cautious before making this assessment, as we should always only want the best for them, and encourage them achieve their greatest selves.\n\nAnd yet, not everyone is necessarily cut out for every job/qualification/position out there, although we can't always know this unless we try.\n\nI do think this guy could do with some professional support if his ADHD is causing these organisational issues, but I also think his girlfriend's concerns are valid. If he's not pursued these means on his own after multiple failed attempts due to them, it doesn't speak positively of his understanding of what this journey will entail.", "Yeah, that's why I think you're just the wrong person to help with that. It's not that you're not trying. It's that your way of helping doesn't work for him. That's not your fault. Trying to help someone with ADHD through the rigors of applying for a PhD program is not simple. He might need a learning support specialist that's familiar with ADHD to help (like someone from his former school, or the school he's applying to).  \n\nDeciding he's incapable of doing the program based on your help not being helpful is what's not ok.", "Based on the fact she's said he doesn't acknowledge, and therefore seek help for his disabilities, is a cue for concern. He has his own things to work out, and all she can do is point him in the right direction, which it sounds as though she has, to no avail. So this sounds as much as a behaviour/attitude problem as a learning difficulties one, which is where her doubts stem from.", "I've told him a million times he should get help but he believes his parents who think he's fine.\n\nI understand the disorganization and I expected that but what I don't understand is that he insists on doing the application the exact same way each time when he knows it's never worked before. Even if he doesn't remember how to solve the problem he should at least know that there is one, but it's like that info doesn't stay in his head. I don't know how he can manage this if he refuses to get help.", "Definitely he needs to take responsibility for his adhd, and I would assume that his inability to do so has leaked into plenty of other areas of their relationship.  I still think it was unkind to tell him to give up instead of telling him the actual problem here is that he needs to deal with his adhd.  That would have been a more supportive option that showed him care.\n\nIf she doesn't say it now, she'll be saying it later for some reason that involves both of them because if they can't work together on an application for him, how are they going to work together on things that concern both of them later?", "Sorry, I've been saying things to help you understand, not criticize you. I empathize with you completely!  It's an absolutely frustrating struggle to work with somebody with adhd who isnt getting it treated.  It's just that criticism with your partner might not work as well as kindness and understanding.\n\nObviously, he needs to put the work in too or you'll just get emotionally burnt out, but I think if you're going to stay with him, it'll be helpful to learn more about adhd, so that you can understand him better.", "Yeah, that's part of the adhd. I'm saying all of this as someone who is with someone with adhd that was not diagnosed as a kid (we're both in our thirties), and both of us are only learning about it now.  So many things that I thought was my partner being shitty were his brain working differently.  He couldn't explain it, and I didnt understand it.  If you guys want to work, you're both going to have to take the time to learn about it, and he's going to have to get treatment.", "I don't think I can stay with him if he's not willing to get professional help. And id even help him set up appointments if he's willing to go. But if he can't even get that far I don't see what I can do for him.", "That's fair enough. I hope he can agree to try getting help.  Good luck OP \u2764", "NTA. \n\nYou mentioned in a comment below that he wants to do medical research, so I feel uniquely qualified to make a judgment on this. I do medical grant applications for a living, so I have the authority to stress to you that pretty much *all* medical research happens with the aid of grant money in some regard. The process of applying for grants is an enormous and detail-heavy task. Most organizations have exacting standards for everything from page limit to font size; just check out the [guidelines for applying for a grant from the National Institutes of Health](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/how-to-apply-application-guide/format-and-write/format-attachments.htm), for example, which is one of the major grant funding organizations.\n\nIf your boyfriend can't even meet a *deadline*, his chances of doing research as anything more than, like, a lab tech or someone who isn't actually spearheading the research are effectively zero. And I'm pretty sure you don't need a PhD to be a lab tech.", "It kind of sounds like you should get your PhD, OP. You know the requirements since you've had to do all the work for your bf. Don't worry about what you said; that guy won't make it.", "So let me get this straight:\n\n\\- Wants PhD in medical research but can't be bothered to check deadlines or follow an application\n\n\\- Repeats mistakes and doesn't adjust or change anything YoY\n\n\\- Dismisses partner without even checking or considering their POV, while assuming he is right\n\nProfessional and personal red flags all over. (I'd say he does not sound suited for the scientific field, but again I've met plenty of male scientists who are absolute dismissive narcissistic assholes.) **NTA**, girl, he's lucky to even have you around.\n\nEDIT: INFO: Why does he want to pursue a PhD in this particular field? Parental pressure? Childhood dream? Or genuine interest?", "It\u2019s gonna be really hard to get a PhD if he can\u2019t even fill out and submit the application. NTA", "OP stated in comments earlier that her BF refuses to do/get any treatment for ADHD. His parents don\u2019t believe he needs it and it seems he believes them. Such a shame.", "I've learned to ask \"Do you want my honest opinion?\" And decide what to do based on their reaction. Eager or stoic usually mean half bullshit your answer.", "Is he medicated? Honestly, it sounds like better ADHD treatment might potentially help him if he\u2019s not optimized", "Sounds like a guy who won't remember his kid's allergies, or their best friend's name, or that it's his turn to pick them up from soccer practice.", "Oh god I wish more people with that attitude washed out BEFORE entering doctoral programs", "The boy friend might actually be happier as a lab tech, without the same responsibilities for deadlines, writing up the grants, etc.\n\nThat is not failing, that is finding the right niche for his skills and his weaknesses.", "The procrastination and missed deadlines sounds like ADHD but the stubborn delusion and lack of memory sounds like something else (and probably more debilitating...)", "Is he taking medication for his ADHD? If he is not, he should be. Memory and executive function skills are severely hindered with ADHD and it is no wonder he is having the issues he is.", "I think you should add this info to your post. At first it sounds like you're saying he cant get a PhD cause of his ADHD, which isn't cool, but its actually his inability to take feedback, his unwillingness to get treatment or support for his ADHD and his complete denial of reality around deadlines etc that are stopping him from getting a PhD.", "The self-driven part will be a major problem with his untreated ADHD.", "I'm a doctoral student with ADHD and like...I'm doing my doctorate because I love this subject and the work so much that it motivates me to be organized and responsible. The whole intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation thing, which is very common with ADHD. Of course the way ADHD manifests varies a lot, but I do wonder if OP's bf doesn't actually want to be a medical researcher, isn't actually interested in the science, but rather is attached to a particular fantasy of success.", ">A supportive person would assist him with the application process and finding out whether or not there were alternative means of applying.\n\nWhich, if you had read OP comments, she has, but the bf refuses to follow, so yeah, NTA", "better he hears it from you tbh NTA", "NTA though your boyfriend can definitely do it if he gets on top of his adhd. There is adhd behavioral therapy which can help in addition to stimulant medication.", "NTA- his mental issues show major signs of needing professional help. Because he won't even accept the help he requested from you. He actively decides not to listen to you or remember anything you say.  He has severe cognitive dissonance going on. \n\nBut without medical intervention,  he wouldn't be able to pass his classes.  There is no point in applying for a PhD if you can't even figure out how to apply. Moreover,  you can't figure it out when someone is holding your hand through it.", "NAH\n\nI'm just going to speak from my perspective of being recently diagnosed with ADHD at 27 (now 28). \n\nEvery failure I had throughout school began to make sense to me as I perused the ADHD sub and spoke to my psychiatrist. It genuinely comes as a surprise when deadlines roll around etc. \n\nMany of us feel that the name Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is misnamed. It seems to imply that we're all hyperactive folk. This is not the truth for all of us. Some argue it should be split like Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity. I absolutely do not suffer from hyperactivity, in fact quite the opposite. \n\nSo right now, my fiance is the sole breadwinner and I keep the house, make food, etc. He worked today from 9a-7p and all I managed to get done was half the dishes (like five plates and a couple bowls). If you asked what I did all day, I couldn't tell you the half of it. It's classified as a disability for a reason. \n\nYour BF sounds just like me, all the smarts, all the drive, but none of the attention span to actually see something all the way through. I urge you to just check out some of the posts on the handful of ADHD subs on here, they can be really insightful into his behavior. \n\nYou're not wrong for feeling like he may not be able to complete a PhD program right now, but maybe if he were properly medicated and got his ADHD under some control, he may be able to really shine. \n\nOne of the most consistent themes with ADHD folks is hearing \"so much potential, if only you applied yourself\". It's hard. We know we can, but our brains are actively fighting against us. \n\nI don't think you're an AH, I think you're human and frustrated with what's going on. Again, maybe just to get more perspective from his standpoint, talk to more folks with ADHD and see how what happened with him is a classic story with us. \n\nOf course it's not an excuse to keep dumping money and time into something when you're not well, but I think he's genuinely struggling with his disorder. Sometimes we need a little honesty to bring us back to earth, but if I were you I'd frame it more like \"get better help for your disability before you try tackling this again\". For one, it's only going to keep adding to the shame spiral if he keeps trying but failing. \n\nWishing the best to you both. For what it's worth, I believe in him, you, and y'all as a couple.", "Why do you want to be with someone like this? You can't ever offer him information that goes against what he thinks he knows without him getting mad?", "You need to tell your husband that he needs to wake up. This is coming from someone with a bachelor's in physical chemistry and dreamed of getting a PhD to do exactly what he wNtz to do. You know what I found out with my experience? Those jobs don't exist.  I mean yes they do, but your more likely to win the lottery than land one. I'm not trying to sound stuck up when I sY that I'm the smartest person I know, but my point in saying that is you literally need to be brilliant to do that sort of stuff. Not to mention most of it happens at universities where your required to do post doc work, plus it all depends on grant funding and stuff. 90 percent of the jobs in the scientific community is bull shit qc lab work that really doesn't require a degree and honestly you could train anyone to do. I'm sure his teachers told him it was possible. Mine did too. But the problem with that is none of my teachers ever actually did anything in the real world. They went from undergrad to doctorate to teaching. They have zero experience with real world applications but tell students that yes all of this is within their grasp if they work hard enough. Let him read this comment if he wants. I get it that it's tough to give up on a dream but sometimes you have to. I decided after all that bullshit to get into cyber security. I make waayyyyy more money and am soo much happier with my  job. I get he thinks he's going to cure cancer or create some new scientific breakthrough but the likelihood is even if he does get a PhD, he will be stuck doing something super boring or nothing at all like he thought it would be.", "Oh, for sure. Lab techs make pretty decent money, at least where I work, and without them, everything would fall apart in the labs. There's no shame in being one, it's a great career.", "Thats effectively the same thing- they cant really say \u2018no\u2019 there, because they know youre lying then.", "ADHD does not cause issues like *that* \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f OP\u2019s boyfriend is acting like he\u2019s severely brain damaged.", "He's not just forgetting though, he wants her help but then argues back if he doesn't like what she's telling him. I have ADHD and I'm very rigid when I think I'm right, but this is on a whole different level. It doesn't sound like he's willing to attempt to integrate information that contradicts his beliefs, which is not acceptable for a scientist."]}
