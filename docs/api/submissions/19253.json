To say we were devastated is the understatement of the century. A week after the surgery my BIL and SIL sent us each photos of them holding babies with the caption \"preparing for fatherhood/motherhood\" (they were not pregnant at the time).

A month goes by and my SIL tries to reach out by saying something along the lines of \"I know I'm last the person you want to hear from\" (duh) and I engaged by saying, \"now why would you think that\" to which she replied \"we are trying for a family too and we don't want you dimming our happiness.\" My MIL got involved and basically told us that neither party was in the wrong and that the men had to forgive each other because \"they're brothers.\"  They came into town for our wedding and my BIL reached out to us beforehand telling us to be nice to his wife because she was feeling \"anxious\" and felt like we \"hated\" her. We were nothing but pleasant, not overly friendly, but we were not rude in the slightest. After our wedding we had not heard from my SIL. She soon became pregnant, and we suffered yet another ectopic pregnancy. They knew and said nothing. I was not invited to the baby shower and we weren't told when the baby was born. Now any time they are brought up we are told to be \"the bigger person\" and \"move on\" because it is causing unnecessary drama.

My response to her would get me banned", "Why are you even questioning yourself? If everything is as you say it is, NTA\n\nThat was an incredibly rude thing to do to parents that just lost a pregnancy \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI wouldn\u2019t speak to them ever, apologies or not, let alone still inviting them to the damn wedding.", "NTA.\n\nFirst and foremost, I\u2019m so sorry for the pain and trauma you\u2019ve been through while TTC. I can\u2019t even begin to imagine how heartbreaking your experiences have been for both you and your husband. \n\nNow, onto your awful family-in-law. They only want you to \u201cget over it\u201d and forgive your SIL because it will make *them* feel better about themselves despite never offering a single apology or acknowledgment of their role in the pain you\u2019ve felt. \n\nTheir willingness to exclude you as punishment for being hurt by their actions (and lack of actions) is incredibly telling. Honestly, I think you need to ask yourself whether or not you *really* want to call people like that family or have anything to do with them.", "NTA\n\nThese people (including your MIL) are incredibly heartless. I am so sorry for your losses and hope you find peace - however that looks. I think finding that peace should include going no contact with these people.", "NTA.\n\nIt took me over 60 years to leave my toxic family behind. My life would have been so much better if I had done it decades ago. I never realized how their presence in my life was a weight that I carried 24/7. Dropping that weight is like being set free.\n\nLeave that weight behind.", "NTA. Your SIL is not a good person and your BIL is either enabling her behavior or participating. My guess is the latter. Your MIL is facilitating this madness by saying \u201cneither of you is wrong\u201d. and you should \u201cbe the bigger person.\u201d\n\n*Why do you need to be the bigger person if SIL has done nothing wrong?*\n\nYour MIL knows good and darned well your SIL has been repeatedly and unnecessarily cruel to you. What she wants is for you to be a doormat so SIL can go back to walking all over you. \n\nYour MIL doesn\u2019t want to say anything negative to or about your SIL because she knows she\u2019d likely be barred from seeing her grandchild. That leaves the burden of apology on you (in her mind, at least). \n\nYou do not owe any of these people an apology. They owe you one, especially your SIL. I know it sucks for you and your husband, but y\u2019all need to go LC or NC with the whole lot of them until they\u2019ve acknowledged what they\u2019ve done and give you an apology. A real one.", "NTA, I'd go no contact", "I too have a toxic SIL and BIL. They are both narcissus and it sounds like your in laws are too. We finally decided to cut them out of our lives and quite frankly we could not be happier. They will never see themselves as being in the wrong. They don\u2019t care about you so do yourself a favor and cut the fat. You will be much happier. You and your husband need to focus on yourselves. You deserve better and can probably find it in a \u201cchosen family\u201d instead. I wish you the best \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA, \nBut you have to let go for yourself. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to be friends or even be in the same place but counting how many times they have wronged you only keeps you focused on the negative. \n\nI am savage when I comes to protecting my peace. I cut negative people out. Yes even family. I do what makes me and my family happy and protect it at all costs. \n\nYou will most likely never get a genuine apology or even recognition that they wronged you in any way. \n\nSo you can do what most do,  sweep it under the rug,  be incredibly fake to keep the peace, and keep tally of all the shitty things they do to you guys or you can just stop giving them the opportunity to do it. \n\nI always go for the later. \n\nFamily can be some of the most toxic things in your life. It is messy as hell. I alway choose peace. \n\nThe funny thing is my family really hasn\u2019t missed out on much. In my situation it my younger brother and his wife. So when we show up somewhere they always have a nonsensical excuse as to why they can\u2019t make it. \n\nMy mom for a while tried to get me to \u201cbe the bigger person\u201d and I told her everyone else might allow themselves to be completely disrespected and lied to but I will not. There is no point in pretending to have relationships. Either you put the work into it or you don\u2019t and they have chosen multiple times not to. So the ball is in their court. The last time I spoke to my brother I told him 2 things. 1. I\u2019m done trying to have a relationship with you. If you want a sister be a brother, you can call me, you can ask to hang out, you can invite me over, you can make an effort. \n2. If I hear any more lies about anyone in our family I will call them out immediately in the moment in front of anyone and everyone that is there. \n\nGuess who I haven\u2019t heard a word from in 3 years? Lol \nGuess who is happy and doesn\u2019t care? \n\nIt\u2019s very freeing when you just let it all go.", "I am so sorry for your loss. It is terrible that your relatives are shaming you and gaslighting you. \n\nThey are not family. You do not need them. They made a horrible situation worse.\n\nPlease make a happy life with just you and your husband. You may need a few years or more away from these people.  \n\nI wish you peace and happiness.", "Your family is alienating you and your wife because they don't want to deal with bad news? Can't offer support and lament your losses because there's a happy couple elsewhere? That's not how it works. Life is busy. Hearts must be large to deal with the ones we love. \n\nYou don't have to forgive SIL and BIL right now. One day, maybe, when you have your own baby and your heart is lighter and full of love.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, BIL, SIL and MIL are all assholes for everything before your wedding. I don't think not hearing from SIL is necessarily her being an asshole tho, might just not want to trigger you with anything baby related.", "NTA just stop responding. If anyone has something to say, who isn't your spouse, then dismiss it like someone passing gas. It has the same value.", "NTA. The behavior you're describing is intentionally cruel and unspeakablyfucked up, and apparently being blatantly endorsed by your MIL. You'd be justified in telling all of these people they are monsters and never interacting with them. I'm so sorry you've had failed pregnancies. I hope you can cut these people out of your lived entirely so you don't have to deal with the stress they add to your life. Absolutely surreal", "NTA. If my brother said that to me, my foot would be so far up his rear end he'd by new shoe (and I'd expect the same if I said something like that to him.", "NTA. All of your in-laws sure are, however. Is lifelong NC for all of them a possibility?", "My husband and I lost twins at 17 weeks last fall. My close cousin delivered her second two weeks after, and before announcements went out she made sure her sister texted me to let me know privately and to ask if I wanted pictures or if I would prefer not. A couple months later, I attended a family function where another cousin would be present - my mom made sure I knew she'd be visibly pregnant before I showed up, so I would not be caught off guard (I hadn't known previously).\n\nThat's how you handle something like that. That's how family that loves you should treat you - and my loss didn't even come with the potential loss of fertility and later complications that an ectopic does (as shown by your second ectopic. OP, I am so sorry.)\n\nThat kindness and grace also allowed me to share their joy in my own time and space. Last weekend I went to visit cousin #1 and held her very chunky baby without having an internal pity party. It was really healing, but wouldn't have been possible without the understanding of my family.\n\nYou deserve better. Personally? I'd certainly never speak to BIL and SIL again, and MIL and other family members would be walking a pretty fine line. You do not need that negativity in your life.", "NTA at all", "NTA. Your in laws are horrible people!", "NTA at all. I'm so sorry for what you've gone through. Please don't ever speak to any of them again.", "INFO; Can you explain what made you guys upset? Did they only send the photos to you and your husband, was it like a family group chat, mass text, Facebook post?", "My son died during his delivery. I went at 9 months. He strangled. I almost died. I had to hold my 7lb full term dead son in my arms. And I'm still confused as to what made you so angry. It poorly timed. Bad taste. Not a personal attack. Unless theres history I'm missing???? During the weeks after my son's death many family members said insensitive things to me. Things that upset me and made me mad but I realize its a tough topic. Are so angry and full of rage because you think it was a targeted attack to mock you for the loss? Do you think it planned? Or are you that angry and upset because they were insensitive and didnt think about you enough? I'm assuming they sent those to everyone because they were starting to try and get pregnant?", "There's a whole bunch you're not saying here.\n\nYour brother and sister in law posted a picture at a bad time for you.  It wasn't directed at you.  I'm sure they didn't even think about you seeing it as they were holding a baby, and feeling optimistic.  You decided it was an insult directed at you.\n\nI'm sorry for what you've gone through.  It sure looks like they're being as careful with you as humanly possible.  That means not reminding you in any way of their pregnancy and birth.\n\nYou said a lot of stuff that has your sister in law terrified of offending you inadvertently.\n\nYTA", "YWBTA\n\nA little insensitive but not worth keep fighting about especially since it happened a year ago.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
