They only want you to \u201cget over it\u201d and forgive your SIL because it will make *them* feel better about themselves despite never offering a single apology or acknowledgment of their role in the pain you\u2019ve felt. \n\nTheir willingness to exclude you as punishment for being hurt by their actions (and lack of actions) is incredibly telling. Honestly, I think you need to ask yourself whether or not you *really* want to call people like that family or have anything to do with them.", "NTA\n\nThese people (including your MIL) are incredibly heartless.

I cut negative people out. Yes even family. I do what makes me and my family happy and protect it at all costs. \n\nYou will most likely never get a genuine apology or even recognition that they wronged you in any way. \n\nSo you can do what most do,  sweep it under the rug,  be incredibly fake to keep the peace, and keep tally of all the shitty things they do to you guys or you can just stop giving them the opportunity to do it. \n\nI always go for the later. \n\nFamily can be some of the most toxic things in your life. It is messy as hell. I alway choose peace. \n\nThe funny thing is my family really hasn\u2019t missed out on much. In my situation it my younger brother and his wife. So when we show up somewhere they always have a nonsensical excuse as to why they can\u2019t make it. \n\nMy mom for a while tried to get me to \u201cbe the bigger person\u201d and I told her everyone else might allow themselves to be completely disrespected and lied to but I will not. There is no point in pretending to have relationships. Either you put the work into it or you don\u2019t and they have chosen multiple times not to. So the ball is in their court. The last time I spoke to my brother I told him 2 things. 1. I\u2019m done trying to have a relationship with you. If you want a sister be a brother, you can call me, you can ask to hang out, you can invite me over, you can make an effort. \n2.

My close cousin delivered her second two weeks after, and before announcements went out she made sure her sister texted me to let me know privately and to ask if I wanted pictures or if I would prefer not. A couple months later, I attended a family function where another cousin would be present - my mom made sure I knew she'd be visibly pregnant before I showed up, so I would not be caught off guard (I hadn't known previously).\n\nThat's how you handle something like that. That's how family that loves you should treat you - and my loss didn't even come with the potential loss of fertility and later complications that an ectopic does (as shown by your second ectopic. OP, I am so sorry.)\n\nThat kindness and grace also allowed me to share their joy in my own time and space. Last weekend I went to visit cousin #1 and held her very chunky baby without having an internal pity party. It was really healing, but wouldn't have been possible without the understanding of my family.\n\nYou deserve better. Personally?

Lots of DARVO attacks trying to gaslight OP into believing she's the bad guy somehow. NTA", "they sent them pictures a week after they lost a baby bragging about they're TRYING to have a baby. Why send those pictures after what just happened? That was cruel", "no. sending the pictures a week after what happened is inexcusable.

Theyre going out of their way to be downright awful and so so ugly to y'all.

You're NTA & should really cut them out & ignore anyone telling you (the wronged party) to be the bigger people if you still want to have a relationship with them (MIL). \n\nAsk your MIL what you pretending (because that's what she wants you to do) that *her* other son & his wife choosing to send what they did after *knowing* what happened & didn't apologize once confronted teaches them other than they can bully people because their victims will just forgive them even when they never show remorse? Is that what she really taught her children? \n\nIs your BIL the golden child by chance? Her behavior regarding this behavior makes me believe that he's been allowed to be an AH & bully all of his life due to her enabling him. \n\nEither way, you *were* the bigger people by even allowing them at your wedding. They only worried about *their* feelings & themselves like true narcissists. \n\nTheir horse can no longer cross the river due to them burning the bridge multiple times & it's not the bridge builder's fault they kept playing with matches after the first time they were informed about why it burned. You didn't burn the bridge & you don't have to rebuild it no matter if they're *family* or not.

They're each narcissists.

I'm sure it will be heartbreaking for both of you and especially your husband, but if he is \"on your side\" and committed to protecting you from extremely toxic people, it will probably be necessary to go to NC or very LC with them. \n\nYou're not crazy OP.
