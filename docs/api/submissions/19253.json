They only want you to \u201cget over it\u201d and forgive your SIL because it will make *them* feel better about themselves despite never offering a single apology or acknowledgment of their role in the pain you\u2019ve felt. \n\nTheir willingness to exclude you as punishment for being hurt by their actions (and lack of actions) is incredibly telling. Honestly, I think you need to ask yourself whether or not you *really* want to call people like that family or have anything to do with them.", "NTA\n\nThese people (including your MIL) are incredibly heartless.

I cut negative people out. Yes even family. I do what makes me and my family happy and protect it at all costs. \n\nYou will most likely never get a genuine apology or even recognition that they wronged you in any way. \n\nSo you can do what most do,  sweep it under the rug,  be incredibly fake to keep the peace, and keep tally of all the shitty things they do to you guys or you can just stop giving them the opportunity to do it. \n\nI always go for the later. \n\nFamily can be some of the most toxic things in your life. It is messy as hell. I alway choose peace. \n\nThe funny thing is my family really hasn\u2019t missed out on much. In my situation it my younger brother and his wife. So when we show up somewhere they always have a nonsensical excuse as to why they can\u2019t make it. \n\nMy mom for a while tried to get me to \u201cbe the bigger person\u201d and I told her everyone else might allow themselves to be completely disrespected and lied to but I will not. There is no point in pretending to have relationships. Either you put the work into it or you don\u2019t and they have chosen multiple times not to. So the ball is in their court. The last time I spoke to my brother I told him 2 things. 1. I\u2019m done trying to have a relationship with you. If you want a sister be a brother, you can call me, you can ask to hang out, you can invite me over, you can make an effort. \n2. If I hear any more lies about anyone in our family I will call them out immediately in the moment in front of anyone and everyone that is there. \n\nGuess who I haven\u2019t heard a word from in 3 years?

My close cousin delivered her second two weeks after, and before announcements went out she made sure her sister texted me to let me know privately and to ask if I wanted pictures or if I would prefer not. A couple months later, I attended a family function where another cousin would be present - my mom made sure I knew she'd be visibly pregnant before I showed up, so I would not be caught off guard (I hadn't known previously).\n\nThat's how you handle something like that. That's how family that loves you should treat you - and my loss didn't even come with the potential loss of fertility and later complications that an ectopic does (as shown by your second ectopic. OP, I am so sorry.)\n\nThat kindness and grace also allowed me to share their joy in my own time and space. Last weekend I went to visit cousin #1 and held her very chunky baby without having an internal pity party. It was really healing, but wouldn't have been possible without the understanding of my family.\n\nYou deserve better. Personally? I'd certainly never speak to BIL and SIL again, and MIL and other family members would be walking a pretty fine line. You do not need that negativity in your life.", "NTA at all", "NTA.

NTA, at all.\n\nI am incredibly sorry for your health issues and your losses. You deserve to grieve and be surrounded by love and compassion, and that was taken from you. Not to mention you had multiple health emergencies and had to not only deal with physical trauma, but emotional and mental trauma as well.\n\nPersonally, I do not believe in forgiveness when it comes to people like your SIL, BIL, MIL, and anyone else who is trying to make you seem like you're in the wrong here.\n\nSometimes the people we're expected to call 'family' wind up being the ones who hurt us the most. You are under zero obligation to allow anyone to remain in your life when they are a threat to your peace, health, and overall wellbeing.\n\nYour post broke my heart to read, because you sound like a nice person and the people who should've had your back annihilated your trust and betrayed you in the worst ways. I really hope you can permanently remove these demons from your life, start to heal, and enjoy a much brighter future. You deserve it. \n\nAll the best from here on out. Sending good vibes and well wishes, OP.", "WTF NTA. I can't believe you are expected to be the bigger while your SIL gets to get away with being a butthole for saying stuff like we don't want you dimming our happiness.

What they did/said is unhinged.", ">We still have not heard a single word from our SIL in almost a year. \n\nYou can be the bigger person and move on by dropping the rope.\n\nIf she wants to get it contact then she needs to make the effort and start woth an apology for her callous words.\n\nAs adults you BOTH have the choice to decide who you want in your life.  You are entitled to how you feel and they can't take that away just to sweep it under the rug to make sil feel better and keep the peace.\n\nWhat about your peace? What about how you feel?

To use an old phrase, they're slapping you in the face and blaming you for the pain in their hand. \nYou've had two major loses, neither of which were acknowledged by them. \nThey've ignored your pain and you are NOT required to acknowledged their happiness. \nBIL is a dick for telling anyone that has experienced the loss of a child/pregnancy to get over it. He's the one that should apologize and humble himself. \nBut just because he apologizes doesn't mean that you have to allow him in your life. He sounds super toxic and SIL sounds entitled or just inept.", "NTA but your in laws are.  I would never forgive them for that picture they sent. Their not children. They either sent it on purpose or zombies ate their brains. I think we know which option", "NTA. Sorry about your pregnancy losses. I think people don\u2019t want to have empathy for pregnant loss because they\u2019re too scared of it. They don\u2019t want to acknowledge it. So ignoring it it makes them feel better.

That's some perversely cruel shit they're spouting.", "I despise people who say, \"b the bigger person\", cuz most of the time what they r really saying is, person A said/did something wrong and person B has to \"get over it\", cuz A is never going to take responsibility and I, person C am uncomfortable, so u Teo need to make up so I feel better. Usually person C has nothing to do with this, but is totally fine with enabling person A's behavior, right up to the moment it's directed at them. I take the stance that, someday if SIL and brother wanna pull their narcissistic heads out of their narcissistic asses and apologize and beg forgiveness and show genuine remorse and take responsibility then we can consider meaning the relationship. Until then I would simply tell everyone who brings it up that I'm not spending time, energy, thoughts on them and what happened, so y r u? As in, y r u so worried about it? How does it involve/directly affect u? Make them take some responsibility and justify y this all has to b on u. Keep asking those questions, it aggrevates the hell out of them. In case u didn't notice, I'm super petty, so u would b all about that. If it's ur parents then maybe ask them how they raised such a self absorbed child like the brother, and y they think it's OK to b supportive of his actions but not yours.", "NTA.    After our pregnancy loss, my dr told me \u201c no one wants to talk about dead babies.\u201d. a truest statement ever.  your in laws do not want to talk about your failed pregnancies because it\u2019s too hard/emotional or they don\u2019t understand how awful the loss is us you had legitimate heated emergencies.     It is easier for them to stick their head in the sand than to acknowledge your pain.\n\nOn the flip side, i will say that your Bil and Sil deserve to be happy and to celebrate their baby.   \n\nIt is a real shame that all the adults can\u2019t sit down to discuss everything.   Everyone in this family loses because there are hurt feelings and miscommunication.", "OP I can guarantee if my brother and his wife did anything remotely close to this to my wife, we would not have to worry about be nice to them ever being said. We would NOT have anything to do with them again. Being the bigger person is one thing but outright KISSING their ass is different.\n\nAn old adage, If you're not with me, you're aginn me. This would hold true in my books. I don't care to have anyone around that I can't trust.\n\nYou can't trust these people or the people that stand with them.\n\nI would write them all off.", "NTA. I\u2019m probably going to be banned, but I\u2019d of told them both to Fuck Off permanently.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your losses, this should of been a time when Family cocooned you in love and support.

It\u2019s bloody hard. Be kind to yourself. They\u2019ve been insensitive, both in the pictures sent and not inviting you to the shower. They may misguidedly think they were sparing you pain. They\u2019ve wronged you, you don\u2019t have to forgive them, but in this instance there might be better times for all of you if you can get through this. You\u2019ll need each other and you\u2019ve suffered enough.

It was so intense and so sad. It takes time to get used to the fact you nearly died and it takes a lot longer to mourn the loss of the fetus and your fallopian tube. It is completely normal to need time and not want to directly be confronted by babies right at that moment. \nThat doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be happy for other luck.
