Went back to work. Popped out with it later to pass it in when I\u2019d finished work and started dinner. Met the neighbour in a huff on the phone to their partner looking for their \u2018missing parcel\u2019. No thanks, just huffing that they wondered where it was and I should have left a note for them! \nStrangely I don\u2019t get disturbed by their deliveries anymore\u2026", ">If I inconvenienced someone this often they'd be getting a gift card, not a lecture. \n\nAnd if they had to text me to remind me to come get my stuff that they were inconvenienced by collecting, I would have been so embarrassed I would have responded immediately to find out when would be okay for me to come over and get it.", "They can tell their kids to stay out of stuff or hide things. I never knew what I was getting for Christmas, because if I snooped, I would have gotten in massive trouble. They can be parents and stop using OP as a post office.", "Honestly, OP should just leave the packages on the porch of the entitled neighbor.", "I told my neighbors I was going to do this. No delivery driver seems to actually deliver to the correct address or unit number. I got yelled at a couple of times cause I couldn't carry someone's heavy package down to them. (Pulled muscle in back)  I finally told everyone if they didn't make arrangements I wasn't getting them or they could pay me to deliver. I charge 20$ per delivery. Otherwise, they can sit on my porch until someone gets them.  Recently, my packages have been delivered to the wrong unit.  I have to retrieve them myself. I'm not asking anyone to do it for me.", "If I lived in OPs neighborhood and her neighbor came by to bitch about OP Id probably tell her off.  Like sorry, but baked goods lady is literally perfect and I will not standby while you slander her\ud83d\ude02", "Ah, OK. Even still, they sound ungrateful and rude about you doing them favors.", "Does someone pay you for your time and experience? Then is is absolutely a \"real job\", and needs to be treated as such, don't let anyone devalue you.", "I second this notion.", "Refuse any more parcels from both these neighbours and any others that see fit to complain about your kindness. The have no entitlement to use you home as a personal P.O. Box \n\nnta", "Sounds like it\u2019s time to give the AH neighbor\u2019s share of any baked goodies to your local mail person, fire station, sanitation crew, 911 center, or cops. I\u2019m certain they would be appreciative.", "Ma\u2019am, with all due respect, your neighbors are turds. You are an amazing neighbor for running TWO, not one, T-W-O full time jobs, baking awesomeness, and running a post office. What the hell is wrong with people? The entitlement of your neighbors is gross. They can kick rocks. You are so sweet for helping them out to begin with, the expectation they have that this is now your responsibility, nah, no dice. They can either pay you, or everyone goes their own way.", "The baked goods I understand.\n\nThe packages, I don't. Do all these packages have to be signed for?\n\nAround here they just leave them. They don't even ring the doorbell. Just drop the packages and go. I've had them left in the driveway, on the sidewalk from the driveway to the door, on the porch, and just inside the garage (if it's open).", "If you\u2019ll be nicer neighbours sure \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23"]}
