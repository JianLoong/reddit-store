She's a teacher and she's relatively ne. Shee's only been teaching since 2020. I graduated in 2020, and coincidentally, she teaches at my old high school. Even though her first year teaching was my last year of school, I only remember seeing her once that year, and it was just in passing. I didn't have any of her classes or anything, I don't even think we exchanged any words. \n\nWhen we matched, I felt she looked familiar but couldn't place it. When she said she was a teacher, I checked my high school year book and saw her in there. I told her, and we decided we'd try dating and see how it goes since we're both adults, and I wasn't in any of her classes. I recently introduced her to my parents and they were friendly but pulled me aside and started telling me I should break up with her because the age gap is too big and there was a power imbalance since she's a teacher. \n\nBefore I go forward, I wanna clear a few things up about my parents. My mom is 52, and my dad is 64. They met when my mom was 18, and my sad was 30. My dad was my mom's boss for a while, and there were a couple of months where they dated before my mom found another job. So, in other words, there were a couple of months where my mom was dating her boss. \n\nI admit, I got pissed and I called my parents massive hypocrites since their age gap is bigger than mine, and their relationship actually had a power imbalance. My girlfriend and I left, and my parents sent me a bunch of messages trying to get me to talk to them again, then calling me an asshole when I didn't respond.

Your parents may be parroting back what they heard from others about their own situation, lol. And I don't see a power imbalance in your relationship. She's not YOUR teacher, nor are you a high school student! In fact, given who she's surrounded with everyday, you've got to be pretty mature to keep her attention.", "NTA but before you write them off for hypocrisy, perhaps ask if that power dynamic had a negative effect. Maybe they had insight on the challenges involved \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Seriously NTA good for you dude. They just have to hold that one. As you described they had a power imbalance that it doesn't seem you two have, not mentioning the gap is smaller. They really *only can* call you an asshole because you're right.", "I mean technically they are hypocrites so you arent wrong. You are an adult though im sure they are just concerned about you but overall you decide who you date and who makes you happy. Your parents cant tell you what to do forever. Unless there is something your gf has done to make them believe shes not good for you?", "INFO: You said your parents\u2019 relationship had a power imbalance. Is that actually true, or were you giving them a taste of their own medicine with that comment? If she started at the school your last year there, but didn\u2019t teach any of your classes and you didn\u2019t really interact, how do they figure there\u2019s still a power imbalance three years after you graduated?", "I mean you\u2019re NTA for saying your parents are hypocrites. I\u2019m side eyeing your dad hardcore for that move.\n\nBut your GF gets the eye too. 29/21 is a big age gap", "How is it a power imbalance just because she's a teacher? You're not even in high school anymore, that makes no sense .\n\nNTA, what you said may have seemed harsh to them but it was def accurate.", "NTA- They are hypocrites. You are both grown and there is no reason for them to butt into your relationship and a 30 year old dating a teenager is just cringe.", "God, I'm not sure how to boil this one down. \n\nHere's what i've got: \n\n* Most critically - you're overlooking a lot of nuance.  There is absolutely a power imbalance between a 21yo and a 29yo. It's not because she was a teacher - it's because she has a stable job, and a lot of really critical life experience that you don't. If it's meant to be, wait until you're 26 or so, when it becomes much less imbalanced. \n* Frankly, I don't trust any 29yo who wants to date a 21yo. You're just at really different places in life. \n* Your girlfriend is an idiot. Mainly because if it comes to light, she could lose her job very easily. At the very least, it could make people look at her suspiciously. Teachers should be above reproach when it comes to their relationships with students and former students. Honestly, it might be best that she does lose her job, because that's a HUGE red flag in education. \n* Your parents *are* hypocrites. Frankly, they're lucky they lasted. They still have a point that it's a bad idea. \n\nI'm going with YTA, and your parents are N T A.", "NTA - I actually agree with you, your parents had a worse situation considering it was an actual power imbalance. I think what you and your girlfriend are doing shouldn't be anyone's business. I might assume this but I feel like your parents are freaking out since she is the older one and not the other way around. I think if you were the older one here they wouldn't bat an eye on the relationship and just assume it's okay.", "NTA, they _are_ hypocrites. Even if they figure these are different times and standards, you are an adult making his choices and they should stay out of it, but keep an open ear for times of  need.", "They are certainly hypocrites given their situation.\n\nBut it doesn't make them wrong about you and your girlfriend.  The age gap from 21 to 29 is pretty significant and I guarantee you that if the genders were reversed, AITA would be all up in arms about it instead of showering you with not the AH verdicts.\n\nI think focusing on your parents' hypocrisy isn't particularly relevant.\n\nNAH I guess?  It's tough for me to render a verdict.", "ESH. Hun, women who are 29 don't date a 21 year old dude unless that dude is rich or something is wrong with that woman.", "ESH\n\n1. Your parents are AHs as they are hypocrites to lecture you on power imbalance and age differences. 18 and 30 is a very concerning and, tbh, pretty creepy on your dad\u2019s part.\n\n2. 21 vs 29 is still a huge age gap at your age. It\u2019s reasonable for parents to raise that issue and have an honest discussion about it.  But you very aggressively shut that down so they can\u2019t even talk to you about it. They might actually have some good insights and advice.\n\n3. A 29 year old teacher dating someone so close to her students ages would give most people pause. Borderline creepy even. Not saying it\u2019s automatically wrong, but most people would look at it a bit funny. I mean, *a 30 yo taking their bf to their very first bar on his birthday feels kinda weird*. Why doesn\u2019t she want to date an actual adult? \n\nI look at my own kids growth and the difference between them at 18-20 vs 30+ is remarkable - they\u2019re like completely different - and truly wonderful - humans now despite Herculean struggles when they were younger.", "NTA, your parents are hypocrites but when I was 29, I wasn\u2019t trying to date 21 year olds. There\u2019s a difference in life experience between a 21 year old and someone almost 30. It\u2019s kinda weird.", "NTA, You're a grown ass man and your parents are idiots, do what you want", "NTA", "ESH. They are being hypocritical but you could have handled this situation much better and more calmly. You might have anger management issues.", "NTA, but be nicer maybe? they seem like they care in their own \"special\" way. I wouldnt give that up again for anything in the world imo. but everyones situation is different. weird circumstances but not illegal or even immoral so yeah", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You just called out double standards and they couldn't handle the heat. It is true that teachers shouldn't date their students but if you weren't even in her class or didn't even know her, well, the issue doesn't occur in my opinion.

I don't see anything she could have done to make them think that", "Its not just the years, its the maturity level.  As she approaches her 30s, if she wants kids then she will want to get on with it - trust me, that little voice appears in your head around age 30 - milestones make you reassess things anyway, but when you are a woman and you want kids, you definitely know the clock has started ticking at 30....... they are in very different places and will continue to be for the next few years.", "LOL Reddit hates an age gap!", "I don't know how it's a power imbalance", "Just doing the math - mom was around gfs age when she had OP........21 is a bit young for kids - he has barely lived his life as an adult yet.
