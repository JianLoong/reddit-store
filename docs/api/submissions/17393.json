My older brother (25m) is dating this girl, S (25f).\n\nThis past Saturday, S and my brother visited me and my parents. For about an hour in the afternoon, it was just S and me at my house, because my brother and my parents were out getting some weird car insurance thing figured out. S was just hanging out in my brother's bedroom, so I went up there to ask if she wanted a snack or anything, and I found her sitting on my brother's bed crying. I immediately got concerned and sat down beside her and asked her what was wrong, and she actually hugged me and told me that her verbally abusive ex left a voice message for her. I got very weirded out because, first of all, S is so much older than me and it was creepy. But also, she is my brother's girlfriend and that, in my opinion, means things like hugs are off-limits between us. So I kind of shoved her off and tried cheering her up in my own way, but she didn't feel any better and walked out of the bedroom to cry somewhere else. To be totally honest, I get very skeptical these days about claims about \"verbal abuse\". Is it abuse, or is it just being a little bit rough with your words?\n\nS still wasn't feeling much better when my parents and my brother came back home, and my brother spent a bit of time alone with her in his bedroom, comforting her. I felt that this was more appropriate than S trying to hug someone who wasn't her boyfriend.

Verbal abuse is a thing.", "YTA\n\nHave you ever talked to a woman before? She hugged you while she was feeling bad. That is like human behaviour. If you're not a hugger, sure, make that known.

She didn't make a move on you, but she didn't insult or abuse you, either, and so you should have been much more polite in extricating yourself. \n\nI think you need to think very carefully about how you see women in general, and then it'll become clearer who is the AH here, and why.", "YTA.

I'd go for N A H if it was just the hug, but you also seem to have a completely skewed view of what hugs mean and put  some sort of malice in her actions. \n\nAs for just not wanting her to hug you, it's your own boundaries, you are not obligated to like or want to be hugged by someone.

But, you aren\u2019t wrong for being uncomfortable not everyone is a hugger. You do however have to acknowledge that not everyone views hugging the same way you do. And while you absolutely were within your rights to reject the hug she also is within her rights to want one just not at the expense of you. Next time just say you aren\u2019t a hugger and ask if their is something else you can do to help. If she still needs a hug (which she might) then she can seek it out from someone else. There is nothing creepy or sexual about needing a hug  when you are upset.", "Is it creepy when parents hug their kids too since the age gap is so large?

Creepily (yes, *you* are the creep here, bud) sexualizing a hug from someone who is essentially a family member. I hug my partner\u2019s teenaged brother all the time. He\u2019s a good kid, I love him like he\u2019s one of my own siblings. ZERO weirdness. Do you hug your mom, or is that somehow weird too? She wanted some comfort, not to have sex with you. I promise you, you\u2019re not that great. \n\n2. Doubting someone\u2019s abuse. You are not her. You don\u2019t know what he said to her. You do not get to gatekeep another person\u2019s experiences. You\u2019re not the moral arbiter of the universe who gets to determine whether what your brother\u2019s girlfriend dealt with is abuse or not. Shame on you for downplaying it and doubting her when there is zero reason for her to lie. \n\nYour attitude and behavior display worrying levels of misogyny. It\u2019s clear you don\u2019t respect your brother\u2019s girlfriend enough to not look at her like a sex object, and you\u2019re projecting your weird, hateful views about women onto her.

I hug my friends every time I see them, man or woman. I hug my professors when I go back to my undergrad school and visit them. \n\nIt would be different if you said something about how you don\u2019t like being touched and you told her that but she disrespectful you by doing it anyway but the fact that your only issue is you think hugs are sexual says a lot about you. Also says a lot about you that you are here downplaying her abuse and don\u2019t seem to respect women. \n\nLike, do you have any friends that are women? Have you spoke to women before? Do you hug your parents? I\u2019m so baffled by the idea that you think hugs are inappropriate.", "I\u2019m sorry but I would say hugs are pretty platonic things and as your kinda sister in law I don\u2019t think it\u2019s weird to hug you. I can see why she thought they were not \u2018off limits\u2019 but if you feel they are maybe that\u2019s something you can discuss. \n\nI do think it was weird to overshare about an ex. However, your opinion on verbal abuse is very childish and maybe something you need to consider. Why would this lady lie about verbal abuse?", "YTA.\n\nthere is nothing creepy or weird about her hugging you. If you think that's somehow innappropriate behaviour because she's your brothers girlfriend, that's down to your issues with intimacy or something. Her hugging you while you tried to comfort her is in no way some indication that she is attracted to you in any way, the majority of hugs in my experience are in no way romantic, but a basic and powerful gesture of human kindness.\n\nIf you, say, are neuro atypical and have strong issues with boundaries and people in your space it's one thing, but you don't mention anything like that, just this weird attitude that it was somehow innappropriate gross or wrong.\n\nalso for the record: verbal abuse is 100% a thing. Just because someone isn't physically abusive doesn't mean it can't be a literal nightmare and leave lasting damage to a person.\n\nedit: to clarify, there is absolutely nothing wrong with you making it clear you are uncomfortable with hugs. Just understand that she didn't do anything inappropriate and there's nothing strange about her hugging you in and of itself.", "Info: Why would hugs be off-limits?", "YTA. You sound like you follow some people on the internet, or have people in your real life, that are giving you completely the wrong idea about women and the variety of relationships men and women can have together. \nHugs aren\u2019t sexual.

Oh, and just so we\u2019re clear women don\u2019t, and won\u2019t, ever owe you their attention. That\u2019s something you have to earn by not being creepy, dismissive, or overly sexualizing them.", "Soft-YTA - she was seeking emotional support and by sitting right by her she saw you as a shoulder to cry on. I get you think it's a bit inappropriate since your ages, but there was nothing sexual here", "Kiddo. You're being weird. It's perfectly normal to hug your sibling's partner. It's *especially* normal to want a hug when you're emotionally distressed. People will seek out a hug from *strangers* if they're upset enough and need comfort. \n\nThat doesn't mean you have to be comfortable with the hug, but her trying to hug you in that moment was in no way inappropriate.

Her age and dating status are irrelevant to the appropriateness of hugs. The fact that you were uncomfortable in and of itself isn't an issue. If you don't like hugs or don't like her, that's fine, no hugs. But your reasoning for not wanting hugs was assholey.\n\nAlso your casual dismissal of the validity of verbal abuse when faced with a crying woman is genuinely chilling. Whatever he said, it was bad enough to cause her to cry for quite some time, and you still think he's \"just a little rough with his words\"? And honestly, even if that's all it was, does it actually matter? It's hurting her. That's what you should care about.\n\nIt's not inappropriate to expect a modicum of comfort from others, especially someone you view as inherently close to you. If they've been together for a while, she probably views you as a sort of extended family member and assumed you would be willing and able to support her, especially since you showed concern.", "YKTA. Kinda. You\u2019re young and probably don\u2019t understand all the social norms and you\u2019re totally allowed to not want to be hugged by someone older but this seemed pretty normal to me.

If someone is crying hysterically about verbal abuse and they hug you, they\u2019re hugging you for comfort, not because they are trying to seduce you.  \n\nI do agree it\u2019s more appropriate for your brother to take this one, obviously.  But it sounds like the whole thing just sort of happened this way.  You popped in and asked if she needed anything.  She happened to need a hug at that moment.  Sounds like she didn\u2019t ask for consent first???  Which I can understand if that made you a little uncomfortable.  But overall I don\u2019t think this is a big deal.  It\u2019s okay man, just try and loosen up a little!  \n\nAs a side note, your personal views on verbal abuse are horrifying.  I hope you reconsider them.", "YTA. Grow some empathy, jesus. Hugging people when they cry is pretty damn normal. Sharing that you doubt her makes you more of an AH, should have kept that to yourself.", "YTA and extremely immature. Hugs are not something reserved for a boyfriend. It's about comfort.", "Who gets this dramatic over a hug?", "YTA, Twice. One for shoving her off, two trying to dictate what constitutes abuse.", "You are turning it into something it is not. She needed consoling and you decided she was coming onto you. She probably considered you to be someone she could look to for support based on the fact you are her bfs brother. You have every right not to like physical contact, but assume any physical contact is sexual is weird.\n\nYta with your verbal abuse comment. Educate yourself better than make random judgements on what abuse is or isn\u2019t in your mind. It\u2019s not just being harsh with wording. It\u2019s degrading and diminishing someone with words, often can also include intimidation and threats. It is a tactic used to make someone feel less than and to also frighten them in regard to their physical safety. Often happens because the abuser is wanting to make themselves feel more important and boost their ego while tearing someone else down. It breaks down your mental well being. It\u2019s also usually the first step in an abusive relationship which escalates to physical abuse.", "Ew sketchy.\n\nYou, not her.\n\nYTA", "INFO: are you on the spectrum?\n\nThat would sort of explain this very weird attitude you have and your inability to fully understand normal social interactions.\n\nOtherwise I'd say YTA", "Yta, life isn\u2019t a porno, hugs are not inherently sexual especially with a sad person.", "Man I\u2019m so so sorry to hear she stole your hug virginity, however could she do that to you /s\n\nYeah obviously YTA", "YTA.

Just because she hugged you didn\u2019t mean it\u2019s sexual. I hug people to greet them, to tell them bye or if they say something heartfelt to me.

That being said, if hugs were already established as a boundary then you are perfectly allowed and NTA to not accept that hug. Where you entered the AH territory is your line of \u201cis verbal abuse even considered abuse or is it just being rough with your words?\u201d There is a difference between abuse and speaking roughly. Verbal emotional abuse is abuse and it is not ok for any person to do to another person, especially someone that you\u2019re supposed to love and respect.", "YTA. It would be the same as you comforting a girl-friend of your own. It\u2019s just a hug. She felt comfortable enough around you to be vulnerable , that means she values your friendship and your family. Hugs aren\u2019t sexual. Also, any form of verbal abuse, is abuse.

It's not weird unless you make it weird, or you're being overly touchy or something. I wouldn't call you an AH if you genuinely just didn't want to be hugged or touched in any way - you're allowed to want that space. But to view her as the odd one here I disagree with. She might have been really shaken from what her ex said and needed comforting of some kind.\n\nAlso, coming from someone working in the behavioral health field, verbal abuse is a very real thing.

My older brother (25m) is dating this girl, S (25f).\n\nThis past Saturday, S and my brother visited me and my parents. For about an hour in the afternoon, it was just S and me at my house, because my brother and my parents were out getting some weird car insurance thing figured out. S was just hanging out in my brother's bedroom, so I went up there to ask if she wanted a snack or anything, and I found her sitting on my brother's bed crying. I immediately got concerned and sat down beside her and asked her what was wrong, and she actually hugged me and told me that her verbally abusive ex left a voice message for her. I got very weirded out because, first of all, S is so much older than me and it was creepy. But also, she is my brother's girlfriend and that, in my opinion, means things like hugs are off-limits between us. So I kind of shoved her off and tried cheering her up in my own way, but she didn't feel any better and walked out of the bedroom to cry somewhere else. To be totally honest, I get very skeptical these days about claims about \"verbal abuse\". Is it abuse, or is it just being a little bit rough with your words?\n\nS still wasn't feeling much better when my parents and my brother came back home, and my brother spent a bit of time alone with her in his bedroom, comforting her. I felt that this was more appropriate than S trying to hug someone who wasn't her boyfriend. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If he were to marry her, it might change though, as she\u2019d now be family.\n\nThe other two factors I think are worth mentioning are context and age. A quick, friendly hug in company is very, very different to a deep, extended hug with emotional baggage alone in a bedroom. Nothing sexual about the quick hug (a few child safety courses I\u2019ve been on actually suggest a sort of side hug is a good way to do it). But the long, private hug here indicates at the very least a high level of emotional closeness that is way beyond what OP feels, and is also beyond what is appropriate for a BF\u2019s brother or even a brother in law TBH.\n\nThe age matters here too, since OP is a minor, and S is eight years his senior.
