We didn't have to go that far, we made it like 5 minutes before boarding closed. We asked the airport staff to wait but they said no.

If the meeting was as important as you're saying, he should have figured out a way to make it or called your company to let them know what happened.

You need, the kind they use at the airport to help people get from one place to another quickly who otherwise couldn't?

At the end of the day his problem is not your problem but you do work together on a team.", "NTA. This is really hard. I have been in this situation - not because of my weight but because I have a disability. It was mortifying and there was certainly tension among my coworkers when I arrived at the gate, having busted a$$ to get there to the best of my ability. But by the time we got to our destination we had moved on. We were there to do the work, that was my coworkers\u2019 primary responsibility. What would absolutely for sure have made it so much worse for me is to have one of them stay behind with me as I made my awkward way. I blessed them for knowing that. I was lucky enough to make the flight but it was a near thing. \n\nAlso what I didn\u2019t do is file a complaint with HR and make a huge stink in the workplace. It was a situation that sucked, nobody did anything wrong.

I let my boss know and she agreed it was the right call.", "NAH. the most you could\u2019ve done to help that you didn\u2019t (from what info you gave) is ask them to send him a cart or scooter so he wouldn\u2019t miss the flight, but that wasn\u2019t your responsibility, john could\u2019ve asked for assistance getting out of the plane. that said, john being upset and embarrassed is also understandable given that he literally couldn\u2019t make it and was left behind. i\u2019d certainly feel abandoned too, if that happened to me. calling it discrimination was a little far, but i don\u2019t think he\u2019s being an asshole either. this is an issue that needs to be discussed as calmly as possible. don\u2019t lose your head when you go to the meeting with HR, apologize to john for not staying behind to try to help or asking the airport to send assistance, and maybe point out the fact that he could\u2019ve asked for assistance in a less pointed way, ie \u201cnext time this kind of thing happens to us i\u2019ll make sure to remind you to ask the staff for help, or even ask for you, if you would rather that.\u201d if you make a point out of not only apologizing but being kind to him and offering to help more next time, he\u2019ll be more likely to forgive you and get over it, and HR should also forgive you and get over it lol", "NTA\n\nAsk HR or John, or anyone else complaining about his what should have been done.  \n\nYou stay with him and you lose the account.  You leave him and only he misses the meeting.  \n\nYou didn't make him fat and unable to move quickly.   Maybe a wheelchair should have been used.   I don't know.  But the boss would have probably been pretty pissed if you all had missed the meeting.", "What surprises me, is that in the many years I've flown, I've never had a flight crew refuse to wait for a passenger trying to make a connecting flight, if they've been informed they're on their way. Especially, if they're in the concourse.", "John knows his needs the best, so shouldn't he be the one to ask for assistance with mechanized transit? Expecting his colleagues to know this is needed because he is overweight would be inappropriate and discriminatory, and an HR complaint would still have been filed along the lines of, \"Colleague X embarrassed me by assuming I was too fat to walk and arranging for motorized transit\". At some point, people need to understand their limitations and practice self-advocacy. We all have our areas in need of support, but expecting others to know them and act on them for us is unreasonable.", "But John is TA for going to HR about it and attempting to harm OP\u2019s employment by claiming discrimination. Being an adult means distinguishing between being hurt and being wronged.", "I disagree. John\u2019s an adult. He shouldn\u2019t need a babysitter. His embarrassment is not a company problem.", "John might have been less angry, but I am not sure that their boss would have been.  International flights are expensive, and missing a business meeting would have been very bad.  It is better for some of the staff to arrive than for none to have arrived at the meeting.", "Yeah I'm saying NTA too and that someone probably should have stayed behind.  I'm also not trying to sound mean when I say it is kind of his own fault though...I have a friend that was once very over weight but he still could run faster than me (I'm just not fast) so I'm not trying to blame weight here.  If you miss the flight cause you are slow then it is on you, but it was kind of a dick move to leave him alone from a team building standpoint.  While at the same time, business is business and y'all had a meeting to get to.  I guess he just needs to either accept reality or change, I think it is wrong for him to be causing trouble.", "This would have probably been the best solution", "It\u2019s not Op\u2019s responsibility to make sure their coworker made the flight.\n\nIf John needed assistance he should have arranged it.\n\nPlus, he could have reported Op for requesting the cart and found that equally embarrassing.", "> ETA: you did not and are not creating a \u201chostile work environment.\u201d That refers to multiple or ongoing instances of bullying or discrimination, \n\nHow do you reconcile your statement with what the OP wrote below?\n\n>  John constantly complains and says we are not team players and that we aren't good people.", "If he had any of those other things, it would still be his responsibility to make sure he could get to the gate on time by doing something like getting a wheelchair. It isn't on OP to put their job in jeopardy because someone hasn't ensured they will be on time.", "I don't think any of those hypothetical conditions would have changed anything.  They made an appropriate decision under the circumstances, and I don't see why other reasons for their colleague's mobility issues would change the calculus.  The one factor that could change the calculus for me would be if he had an acute medical emergency of some sort (e.g. a heart attack, seizure, etc.).  In which case leaving one person behind (to make sure he was taken care of in the event he lost consciousness or was taken to the hospital and his family needed to be contacted) would have been appropriate.  But that's not the situation here.", "Oh please. Even then, everyone is responsible for themselves.", "I like your story more so we can empathise with the false narrative you wrote. Poor guy missed his flight. Wasnt his fault his coworkers didnt get him all the available help that he would know to use. How dare he not inform them to go get help. I understand hes grown, but needs a handler like a 8y/o but he is so cute in his lil buisnessman attire \ud83d\ude0d\ud83e\udd2a", "Totally agree! I\u2019m fat and not that quick, and I\u2019d have definitely told my coworkers to leave me behind! I\u2019d rather be embarrassed that I couldn\u2019t keep up than embarrassed we all missed the meeting and thus wasted the trip.", "Yeah I am shocked your HR department took this complaint seriously and that they have somehow convinced you to apologize.  Let\u2019s see, by catching your scheduled flight you saved your company money and made it to the meeting on time.  The guy who could not make the flight did cost the company more money and did not make the meeting.  Seems to me you put the company first \u2026", "Agree and most likely  meeting is being held as standard procedure as a complaint was filed.", "NTA\n\nTough situation, but it\u2019s so much easier for one person to get rebooked than 4.\n\nI don\u2019t think leaving John was rude at all. It\u2019s actually surprising to me that he expected you to miss your flight because he couldn\u2019t walk faster.\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t hold it against you and it\u2019s pretty childish that he filed a complaint.", "Airline is definitely TA. But the story seems fake. If they didn\u2019t have far to go and told the flight attendants that there was a 4th member of their party coming in a few minutes why wouldn\u2019t they have waited? OP is leaving out some important details. I\u2019m also calling the person who booked travel TA for booking flights that close together. It\u2019s not even a matter of physical fitness, what if the gate had been further away and they all missed the \u201cimportant meeting.\u201d", "You clearly don't understand air traffic control or scheduling works, in no way is the airline the AH for boarding and taking off at the time they were supposed to.", "Maybe it would have made it worst and they may have all got terminated for missing the meeting.  Who knows\nNTA   This in no way falls under the definition of discrimination", "Apparently they were supposed to carry him somehow. Like what the fuck??? \n\n\n(I'm overweight and not fatshaming.)", "What about this was inhumane?\n\nThese employees had to catch a flight to a business meeting for work - how they provide for their families. \n\nThey didn't call John nasty slurs, just did what they could to not miss the meeting...", "Yes, if I missed the important meeting due my health conditions while my teammates could make it and cover my absence and close the deal, and still counted me in as part of success, I\u2019d appreciate it.", "Getting a wheelchair or other cart assistance might have been hard given the apparent very short time between flights.", "You realize that they could just push someone in a wheel hair to match their speed, right?", "You\u2019re reaching HARD.  Completely different situation.", "John\u2019s the asshole.  If that were me I\u2019d be glad they made it to the meeting so the purpose of our entire trip wouldn\u2019t  fail simply because I\u2019m slow.", "right? \n\nI wonder if OP could turn it around and say HR didn't adequately provide accommodations for the issue LOL (or the airport?). Your job was to go to the meeting and close the deal, not worry about John's health accommodations.   \n\nand now John is creating a hostile work environment, it seems wildly unprofessional to call OP and crew 'bad people'\n\nAND, OP why are you 'to blame' instead of the other people you were with? seemed like a group decision and OP is getting all the hate - are you their superior?\n\nor, I'm prob reaching, but is OP the only woman there's some weird gendered dynamic? \n\nNTA", "Also let\u2019s say you all didn\u2019t make the meeting. Would the company prefer that? I\u2019d throw it back to HR", "What part is capitalism outside of the obvious that flying costs money?", "Solidarity forever.", "Best answer so far", ">Capitalism makes ~~assholes~~ 41.9% of us ~~all~~ obese.", "Well, they should have been more proactive and planned ahead by providing a better nutrition plan for him if it's the case of over indulging and not another health issue.", "It was a second flight on a layover. The first flight was late \u2014 out of John\u2019s control.", "Yup. What if coworker forgot passport, I\u2019d definitely go by myself and cover their absence.", "I'm not sure if I agree with him going to HR or not. We are only hearing OP's side of the story and there could be other factors that contributed to going to HR. Plus I'm sure OP would be in some shit regardless of him going to HR, had something like this happened where I work the people who left someone would absolutely have explaining to do", "Agree with this. OP is NTA, especially because they tried to get the plane to wait. John is just embarrassed with himself", "Agree. Coworker is not a caregiver for teammate with health issues. Business needs to accommodate people with mobility issues but it\u2019s not on coworkers.", "*Shouldn\u2019t*, I agree!  But now he\u2019s filing HR complaints and causing issues for others. Perhaps if they didn\u2019t all leave him, he wouldn\u2019t have done so is what I said.", "That's easy, John is the one creating a hostile work environment. OP feels guilty about it and wishes to make amends and move on. John is determined to get revenge.", "Well it sounds like John is making it a hostile work environment because they declined to not skip an important meeting. The lack of team player is John; who expected everyone to miss the plane and the important business meeting.", "Disagree on other comments are based on overweightness. If John needs special arrangements such as wheelchair or cart, that\u2019s an arrangement business needs to make for John. coworkers are not caretakers for employees with health issues.\nIf I have to go to business trip and keep eyes on coworker with heath issue, I\u2019d feel uncomfortable to be responsible. I would push wheelchair to be kind but if I was told doing so is my responsibility during business trip, I\u2019d decline. Business needs to hire someone for that during the trip for employee who needs such accommodations. \n\nWeight is sensitive subject but that\u2019s not the case here. Most comments even don\u2019t have word \u201coverweight\u201d or \u201cweight\u201d.", "Agree 100%.", "The part where employees felt pressured by their job (that as you so kindly pointed out, is how they provide for their families) to prioritize one meeting over their coworker. I\u2019m not saying OP is at fault at all. Why would the flight be scheduled so close to the meeting? Why did the meeting have to be in person? I sincerely doubt that this meeting was so important, that it had to be held at that exact time, and if it was, why didn\u2019t OP\u2019s company plan better?", "The part where they didn\u2019t care about the health and well being of another human being", "If you order one in advance, they have it waiting for you. Also if they know they have a passenger needing assistance coming to a flight, they are more likely to hold it, as it\u2019s up to them to provide the airport wheelchair.", "Sometimes. Not all wheelchairs can go quickly. What if it was your one-legged team mate?", "I disagree. It\u2019s exactly the same.", "Keeping your job. Making a meeting. On and on.", "They prioritized their job and the meeting over their coworker. Because they felt pressured like their jobs depended on them being there.", "He isn't going to cause an issue for any of them. They did nothing wrong. \n\nIt's more embarrassing he is trying to get his cowroners in trouble for this than it was for him to miss this flight. \n\nIf that were me I'd probably just apologize to the supervisor that I wasn't able to make the flight and explain why and leave it at that. I also would have told my coworkers to not wait on me because the meeting I'm assuming is important and there's absolutely no reason they should all miss it and feel bad over my personal issue.", ">The part where employees felt pressured by their job (that as you so kindly pointed out, is how they provide for their families) to prioritize one meeting over their coworker. \n\nI'm very curious about how this will end up with HR for that reason. \n\nIt's also frustrating there was no cart to help him. I've had people rushing for planes for far stupider reasons (minutes to get across the airport to make a flight isn't very reasonable for anyone, really) and not have to hoof it. I've been FAR earlier for connections and they insisted I get on a cart.", "Keep moving the goalposts.", "I don't know why you're trying to come up with other scenarios like some kind of \"gotcha.\" How exactly do you think OP could have helped John? Clearly, they can't physically assist him in running there. They asked staff to wait for him and were turned down. The only other thing they could have done was ask staff to assist him, but the odds of staff getting to John and then helping him reach the plane within 5 minutes are very low.", "It's different because if he was in a wheel chair they could push him but he is not.", "My sentiments exactly", "Not goalposts. Analogies in the hope to explain how leaving their team mate behind was despicable.", "Not necessarily. And what if it was their one-legged team mate with crutches?", "But it's not is it? And what were they supposed to do ,miss the meeting and probably get fired by the boss?", "You just made up that last part."]}
