Your brother likely knows what his daughter likes and knows she doesn't like the garbage your mom made. I say garbage because you seem a little too eager to claim it was delicious.

Here's one way your mom is not being a good parent: don't offer advice to your adult children when they don't ask for it. Here's another way: preparing an unexpected meal for a picky eater. It's not good parenting to let a child go hungry. It's not good parenting to stop a son from feeding his hungry daughter. It's not good parenting to not be adaptable to needs. Your mom is old school and that doesn't make her a good parent. Ruling over 7 children doesn't make her a good parent. If the worst thing you can think of is a child growing up to be a \"spoiled picky adult\" then I think you lack sufficient imagination to critique your brother's parenting ability. Does his daughter trust or flinch around him? Does she smile when she's around him or bend over backwards to please him? Does she have bruises from being physically abused? Is she afraid to express her feelings and needs? I'm going out on a limb to suggest that your brother has chosen a different parenting style from your mother's for reasons that seem important to him. He wants a different relationship with his child than the one the you two clearly have/had with your mom. You don't have to like what I'm saying or agree with your brother's style. But since you're asking, YTA most definitely. You're behavior suggests that you still have some growing up to do yourself and could maybe benefit from gaining some distance from your family dynamic and the role that's been carved out for you as mom-pleaser.", "OP: \"Moooooooooom, brother is telling his daughter she doesn't have to eat her dinner and he's going to buy he food insteaaaaad.\"\n\nThis is ridiculous!

Forcing kids to eat food they dislike, or eat when they\u2019re full is yet another example of BS that adults force on kids, but would never tolerate themselves. It teaches them to ignore their own bodily autonomy, to ignore their.body\u2019s cues, and it creates an unhealthy relationship with food in general, and it\u2019s actually a really positive thing that your brother has recognised the harm your mother did to you and is taking a different path. Your brother sounds like he understands and accepts his daughter, he wants meal times to be a positive experience, rather than a needless battle, and he isn\u2019t repeating the mistakes your mom made with the two of you. I\u2019m sorry your mom treated you like that, but it doesn\u2019t give you the right to subject your niece to it. It\u2019s really easy to be critical of someone else\u2019s parenting when you still live with mommy and have no parenting experience yourself, mind your own business and if you can\u2019t help your brother advocate for your niece, leave her alone.", "YTA your mother is abusive and you are not a good person", "YTA.

Having had seven kids is no guarantee that the person who bore them was a good parent, and your brother\u2019s needing to stay there doesn\u2019t give Mom carte blanche to stick her nose into his family dealings.

Thankfully my mom wasn't super strict about that so I'll probably make it to 40 before I lose half of my digestive system like my sister did. \nMy point is steamrolling a person's hunger cues and food choices in the name of discipline is a proven fast track to eating disorders and digestive issues.

They had acorn squash with dinner, I tried it and HATED it and politely refused to eat any more. And he made me sit there with that stone cold squash until bedtime.\n\nTurned out later that I was right - I didn't like it because it made my mouth feel funny. I'm allergic to them.", "I grew up with 3 siblings and my two younger sisters were notoriously picky eaters. My parents cook nearly exclusively Chinese food at home. We were always given the option to eat what was made or we could make ourselves a sandwich with side salad or steamed rice with a fried egg and vegetables. We also had to clean up our own dishes and any additional mess made in the kitchen. This always worked in our household. No arguments and no one went to bed hungry. Any dinner leftovers were taken for lunch by a family member the next day.", "true! when I was 6 or 7 my aunt would fill my plate to brim and then fill my toddler sister with the right amount then she would say I will be punished if i cant finish my food before my sister. Until now, I have this unhealthy urge to finish my plate even if it doesnt taste good or even if I am already full", "Youngest of 6 here, with a mother who did this and can confirm the damage. She'd serve food she knew I couldn't stand, call me picky (I have sensory issues as I'm ADHD), and make me go without food regularly - at least once a week.

Have TONS of babies, but they also have been known to eat their young.

My kids ate or left whichever  foods they liked/didn't like, and have always been eager to try new things. My sister and her husband used to have massive battles at meal times and force their kids to eat things they didn't like, just because that's what the family meal consisted of that day.

Once I had to sleep at the table bc I could not finish it. Then I had to eat it when I woke up. After sitting out all night.

Not to mention the mental issues.", "This is why I let my children pick how much they eat. I don't force feed them. Sometimes they are hungry and eat 3 helpings of a meal.

Hamster moms will however put their babies in their pouches to save them from danger, and if she's too scared she might keep them in there too long.

Horses is a good example.", "So that's why the very THOUGHT of eating a few specific foods make me start to gag, choke, and feel nauseous? \n\nGlad you were here to clear that up!\n\n(This comment is dripping with sarcasm.

If they did not like what I fixed, they could make themselves a sandwich. It should not make any more work for the original cook. I would not eat a few things, such as liver.\n     Some kids have a sensory processing disorder that significantly limits what they will eat. Most typically, they eat a \"brown diet\" of chicken nuggets, fries and crackers, with few fruits or vegetables. They may eat only one brand of cereal. They may vomit if forced to eat foods of the \"wrong\" consistency.  Kids in the Autism spectrum have a higher incidence of sensory processing disorders  but it can happen in isolation. Intervention by a specialist is needed to gradually expand what is eaten. Talk to an MD if this is the case in your family.", "Green peas for me.

Just different sides of the coin.", "That's the common trend in a lot of (maybe most) Western countries, honestly. The statistics are more varied in different countries with really different legal systems, parenthood structures, and access to birth control and education. But generally well over 50% (and I'd guess probably over 75%) of teenage moms' babydaddies are 19-21 or above. \n\nI don't have my hands on the numbers, but the roughest available sketch is: Here's [a CBC article on teenage fatherhood](https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/teen-fathers-support-1.4018191) that says in 2014, 4017 boys ages 15-19 became fathers. During that year, the same time, [10,657 girls gave birth](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1310041601&pickMembers%5B0%5D=3.1&cubeTimeFrame.startYear=2013&cubeTimeFrame.endYear=2015&referencePeriods=20130101%2C20150101), and there are usually [slightly more abortions and miscarriages](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1310016601&pickMembers%5B0%5D=1.1&pickMembers%5B1%5D=2.1&pickMembers%5B2%5D=4.1&cubeTimeFrame.startYear=1998&cubeTimeFrame.endYear=2000&referencePeriods=19980101%2C20000101) for that group in a given year for that group than there are live births. \n\nIt's partly a risk-factor thing. If you're poor, heavily discriminated against, and/or have experienced domestic violence as a child, you're more at risk of getting preyed on by older men, less able to access or insist on birth control, less likely to get an abortion, and more likely to have a dad who flakes out instead of sticking around. \n\nAnd like, even 1/4 of the fathers of teenage girls' babies isn't nothing. That's still thousands of people every year. But usually custody stays with the mother (and if the mother doesn't want the baby, she's more likely to abort than carry it to term and let the father take custody.)\n\nSo it *happens*, but it's still kind of remarkable when it *does.* It usually says that this dad had to actively work to stick with his daughter, at a time when a lot of people would see that as \"tossing his future away\" (though less so than it would be for girls). And actually, him not living with his parents and owning his own house is *another* case of him beating the odds.", "right.\n\nIt doesn't matter.", "Because I don\u2019t kids tell me what to do?
