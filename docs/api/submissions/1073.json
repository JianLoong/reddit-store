Have you reported the bullying? Does your mom not believe you or she says to suck it up? I would write a whole list of ways you have been bullied at school and post it on the fridge. Have her come across it when you are not around. End it with \u201c I feel these reasons are valid enough for me to not be somewhere I feel unsafe, I hope you can hear me now\u201d.", "NTA.\n\nPeople seriously underestimate the long-lasting damage bullying can do to a person. If the school are unable to resolve the situation to your satisfaction, then moving school is definitely the best option.\n\n\"Making everyone's life more difficult\" should not be your mum's primary concern if you are being bullied. Making sure you are in a comfortable and safe environment where you can focus on your education should be.", "NTA. Switch schools if you don't feel confortable where you are. I don't see why its a problem for your mother that you change schools.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'd say bullying is a good enough reason to want to switch schools (don't drop out entirely please!).", "Nta\n\nYou actually mean switch schools not drop out. I think it's definitely understandable if your are feeling as you do. I know it may daughter she that to me and does the work i would have no problem being inconvenienced driving her to school so that i know she is safe and happier.\n\nWhat i am curious about is that you said it has not been a problem on the past so what is going on that you are getting bullied? What are they bullying you about? I think addressing a problem and trying to fix it is a better solution for life but it everything has been tried to no avail then it's not right for you to be made uncomfortable for any reason", "Info needed: How old are you and how many times have you switched schools?", "So you want to transfer schools because you are being bullied? NTA.", "You shouldn't switch schools every time you're bullied. Talk to the principal, guidance counselors, and teachers and see what can be done. Switching schools so much can hurt you in the long run.", "NTA. Switching schools can be a game changer. My BF switched schools in i wanna say high school but maybe middle, for bullying, and it definitely helped him and idk how it inconveniences anyone beyond the brief time spent registering for a different school and signing paperwork", "Depends on how many times op switches school. Sounds like more than once. That can't be the answer for bullying.", "I don\u2019t really get the vibe that the OP has changed schools multiple times but even if they had, and all were for bullying, I don\u2019t see an issue with family being supportive and trying to help them find an environment in which they can actually learn.", "There is far too much missing for any person to make a judgment call. \n\n- how old are you?\n- how many times have you transferred schools?\n- have you attempted to solve the situation at school? Spoken with a counselor, trusted teacher, principal?\n- exactly what do you mean by bullying? The hard truth is that word is so overused and does not necessarily mean what it used to mean. \n\nAgain, you\u2019ve left out way too much info."]}
