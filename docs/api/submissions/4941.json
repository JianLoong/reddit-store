Hannah is currently saving for a new car (just for comfort) and has been working part time at Lucy's work for about 7months. Every time Lucy and Hannah talk about work at home (which is all the time), Lucy always brags how she has put more hours on Hannah's timesheet so she can get more money as she deserves it. For example, her contract is 16hours but she only works 10hours and gets paid for the 16hours. At first, I thought it was nice of her but it came to light that other employees are losing out on hours due to budget issues. \n\nThis also annoys me as I am literally studying/working 7 days a week and am struggling with money, just trying to get into an industry that is really hard to get into. Hannah and Lucy also have been making digs at me about my old car and how I am so frugal with my money but I literally have no other choice. My bf and I have talked about how frustrating it is and my bf has talked to Lucy about how she is putting her job at risk. Since then, the situation has escalated, where Lucy is now paying herself extra too, so she can give the money to Hannah as Lucy is on a higher salary. Lucy has also been making remarks that to be an adult you need a full time job and that is why they don't respect me as much as I am still studying so I do not know the real world... \n\nSo AITA for wanting to report both Lucy and Hannah to HR of the company?
