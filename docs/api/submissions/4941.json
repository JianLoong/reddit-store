And it is a crime that you can be at the very least fired over, at the worst charged with a felony.", "They were taking _about_ work while they were both home. They aren't working from home", "It's fraud. Embezzlement requires that you have legitimate control over an asset that you don't own, like being able to sign corporate checks.\n\nThe cliff notes are basically:\n\n* If you take something that's not yours, it's theft.\n* If you receive something by lying, it's fraud.\n* If you misuse assets or funds owned by someone else who gave you access for defined purposes, it's embezzlement.", "Her bf'sd mom is NOT her family? Then the relationship has no future at all.", "You're right.\n\nEmbezzlement has as an element that you have legitimate control over property or funds that aren't yours, to carry out some assigned responsibility with it, like being authorized to sign checks for your company, and using that access/control for personal gain. That's what makes it a different crime than theft.\n\nThis is fraud, because it's receiving something of value under false pretenses.", "It is actually not. It is a term with origins in common law, and has analogs in many different countries. Germany gor example has a similar differentiation between felony/misdemeanor with verbrechen/vergehen.", "Well, worst case scenario is being fired _and_ charged with a felony.", "op doesn't even work with them\n\nin another comment she said\n\nNo, Lucy offered me a job but due to this situation I declined.", "Op I would report it if it\u2019s true and she\u2019s been doing all this.

I misread the post, and thought OP's part-time job was at the same company, also under Lucy.", "it happens :)", "Thats just wrong, so you are saying that OP should go ahead and report them  and despite the chaos she is going to cause she should still stay at their house. If she says something  to the company first she will need proof. HR arent just going  to take her word for it, since once again  she doesnt work there.  Second of all, in case they do listen  to her without  solid proof, they arent going to just loose their jobs, they most likely  are going to face criminal charges. Does OP really wants to put the person  who provide her with a roof over her head behind bars? Because OP is living at mothers in laws house. OP dont bite the hand that feed you.  And last thing OP doesnt want to report them  because she wants them to do right thing, she is acting  out of jealousy. \nIf you dont belive me i recommend  to read the last paragraph.", "You are acting like the mother the gave OP a roof over her head out of the goodness of her heart, but she is getting rent.
