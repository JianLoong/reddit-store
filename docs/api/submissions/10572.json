He worked full-time too, in a demanding role 12-14 hour shifts 5 days a week. \n\nNow we both worked hard, we both paid bills but he was secretive with money, accounts & such. I never had money left over from my wages after paying for groceries, kids childcare or school fees, uniforms, water, gas & electricity as well as petrol for my car. \n\nIf I would ask him for money for something, he would want something sexual in return, even though I repeatedly told him that it makes me feel bad when he does that. There would be sulking & grumpiness from him saying that HE provides for me & that I would be nothing without HIM, that the house is HIS, not ours, because I didn't financially contribute to the mortgage. \n\nAnyway, I had no funds of my own, so I was able to borrow enough from my parents for myself & my son (11) to move into a rental. Money is tight, but we are both incredibly happy. \n\nI have regained confidence & am enjoying the freedom of not tiptoeing around him constantly. \n\nHe wants to discuss separation & settlement between us & come to an agreement on our own. I'm insisting on dealing with it through solicitors because I was so financially isolated, I have no idea what was going on with mortgages, investments, etc \n\nHe, his friends & family are calling me an asshole & gold digger \n\nAm I the asshole? \nI don't think I am, but some assholes never do \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1677023704, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/118j5v8/aita_hard_working_woman_or_gold_digger/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That includes legal help, family and community support, therapists, and maybe organizations that help with abuse. Because what you experienced is textbook financial and sexual abuse. Do not buy into the bullshit that you are a gold digger; that\u2019s just another way he is trying to control you. Who knows what he is telling his friends family about you, but that is not your concern; taking care of yourself and children is. Obviously NTA.", "NTA. You\u2019ve been in an abusive relationship and you are afraid of being manipulated. Again.\n\nWhere were his friends and relatives when you were struggling?", "guys feel soooo mistreated while they abuse women . That was emotional and financial abuse . you should have been on the deed of the house it is your sons home . Get what you legally suppose to get it is for your son . Men can complain as much as they want but the moms often enough do the majority or the  childcare and tooooo many single mom suffer because they have to raise a kid with no financial support . your son deserves a stable home", "NTA!!!  Of course he doesn't want you to have competent representation!  He can't continue to abuse, cheat and otherwise screw you over if there's someone looking out for you!  Take him for every penny and if they want to spend a bit digging out his concealed finances, invest in it!!!  You and your son deserve everything you can get from this disgusting excuse for a lifeform.  Best of good fortune in your hunting!!", "NTA \n\nAbusers will draw other people in with their tall stories of how they're the 'real victim' and the abused person is a horrible, unreasonable monster. His friends & family only have his version of events, and obviously aren't willing to look beyond his stories to find the actual truth of this abusive relationship. Do as much as possible through a lawyer. Don't meet him to discuss stuff as he will try to manipulate you like always. Ignore his friends and family, it's none of their business and he's rallying them round in hopes you'll be put off from getting what's rightfully yours.", "NTA as loud as I possibly can say it. He will 100% try to screw you over financial and probably try to lure you back in if you do it in person. I would switch to everything possible through solicitors until he settles down. He's trying to continue to control you, you've already escaped, stay free and keep your distance as much as humanly possible", "NTA. You worked at home and outside of the home; he worked outside of the home. You both contributed to the family, and you deserve equal compensation and assets.", "Get a solicitor and a forensic accountant to go over everything. Do not talk with his family. Limit your communication with him to only matters related to your child and only communicate via a traceable system (email/text).\n\nProtect you and your child.\n\nNTA", "NTA- You provided him with childcare and housekeeping so that he could focus on his career. That\u2019s worth just as much as him paying for things. The fact that all the money you made went back into the household tells me that he wasn\u2019t doing a very good job at being a provider. Don\u2019t let him take advantage of you at the end.", "NTA. If you are in the Uk get a solicitor. It is not just the house and investments, you need advice on whether you have a claim on his pension.", "NTA and get the most vicious divorce lawyer you can find.", "NTA\n\nYou did most of the part of the \"heavy lifting\" like the kids, groceries and whatnot.\nTake a lawyer and take the house.\nI'm sure he is hiding his wealth and didn't spent as much as you did in this relationship.", "NTA.  This screams for lawyers.  Anyone who says you are an ah is no friend of yours.", "NTA. Of course his friends and family will take his side. He knows that a formally arranged agreement will work in your favor and he doesn\u2019t want that. Get every penny you are owed.", "Nta by your account, but there's two sides to every story, and the truth always lies in the middle. Getting an attorney to help you through it is a smart choice, all things considered. I feel like he's counting on you not knowing what to look for, and that's why he wants to settle it personally. Also, don't forget that they're only hearing his side, so of course you sound like a gold digger to them. No one ever wants to admit to wrongdoing, especially to their family.", "NTA - HIRE A LAWYER AND FIGHT FOR WHAT IS LEGALLY YOURS", "NTA! Let the lawyers take him for every penny you are due. He sounds like a bloody monster. Good on you for getting away. Stay strong.", "NTA. lawyer up. He is hiding a ton I bet. Get a financial forensic accountant. They will trace every penny he has made and hidden.", "NTA. Maybe we have different ideas about what a \u201cgold digger\u201d is, but someone works and cares for the home and pays bills doesn\u2019t scream \u201cgold digger\u201d to me. \n\nAnd no NTA for wanting to involve lawyers or mediators in your divorce. Self-managed divorces are fine for some couples, but both parties need to be relatively amiable and totally transparent for it to work and it\u2019s clear your ex isn\u2019t.", "Get a lawyer.  I was in your situation and the best thing i did was get the lawyer.", "NTA. Some couples are able to equitably handle divorce without getting attorneys involved but this is definitely not one of those cases. As a lawyer myself I would absolutely suggest you hire an attorney asap. It sounds like your soon-to-be ex-husband is trying to manipulate you into settling for crumbs. Don\u2019t let his insults or peer pressure from his friends/family impact the way you view yourself. It sounds like you\u2019re a great mom who worked hard to provide for your family despite having a controlling and financially abusive husband. Good for you for finding a safe way out of the situation. Keep your chin up and go after what you rightfully deserve! Meet with a few attorneys before deciding whom to hire. You should feel confident about and comfortable with your lawyer.", "NTA. From someone who divorced someone with a Cluster B personality disorder, this is a business transaction and should be conducted through lawyers. Do not trust this man and do not let him manipulate you into settling for less than you're entitled to. Abusive relationships are incredibly hard to leave, and it's hard to trust yourself for a long time after putting up with one for longer than you should have.", "NTA.", "NTA & fuck what he and his associates think tbh", "NTA \n\nGet a lawyer. \n\nAnd forensic accountant", "Obviously NTA, and I think you are well aware of it, but I'm happy to reaffirm it. Lawyer the fuck up, fuck his family, and if his friends saw him treat you poorly, fuck them too. \n\nGo live your life and be free.", "NTA. Don't worry about what people think. That's not going to pay the bills or put food on the table. If you split with a kid. Go for gold look out for the kid and yourself.", "NTA. \nWhat gold does he think you are digging for when you work and provide too ? \n\nThe only reason he worked more than you is because he didn\u2019t have to also take care of the house and kids, that\u2019s also labour. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t want a lawyer because he wants to be able to pressure, manipulate and flake out without any consequences.\nProtect yourself from this dreadful man.", "You are a whole lot of levels of NTA, and I want to meet the person who says otherwise, because I seriously doubt their intelligence.  I would actually consider it foolish NOT to go through legal channels.  It's not even a matter of going after him, it's a matter of protecting yourself.  \n\nGet a great lawyer with no connection to your husband, and communicate through him from here on out.  And enjoy your freedom!  This is just the beginning of better days ahead!", "NTA in the slightest. Both parties would be protected by impartial experts in family law assisting with the agreement. Unless they have something to hide that the experts would find.", "Nope, nope, nope NTA. Use the solicitors and don't back down. His abuse will win if you do", "Nope NTA it's safer going through with a solicitor or similar. Let them call you a gold digger who cares? It's not true. Just shows how ugly they are in their behavior.", "Ignore what his side has to say. In fact, the only time you need to talk to your soon-to-be ex-husband is when it's regarding your child and there's no reason why you even need to be in contact with his side of the family.\n\nEven though it'll end up costing you money, go to a solicitor. I wouldn't trust him for a second negotiating an agreement by yourselves.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\nWithout even judging if he was bad, there should absolutely be transparency of all funds.", "NTA\nGet a lawyer, tell him to talk through your lawyer.  Like you said, you have no idea how much is a fair settlement, since you don't know the full picture.\n\nI'm so sorry you've been through that level of abuse.  He effectively made you prostitute yourself to him, just to get him to pay for things.  Yuck, yuck, yuck.", "NTA. If he wouldn't have been so secretive, you wouldn't literally have to dig to find out wtf you're not getting. Get the best lawyer you can, and good luck.", "NTA this is how the law works, based on how he has treated you in the past I would bet that he is going to screw you out of something if you don't go the legal way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You do not need to trust him to be honest with you at this point when he\u2019s spent a decade being dishonest about finances. The fact that he and his are responding so wildly to you just getting an attorney should tell you he\u2019s hiding something.", "NTA - Do not deal with him at all without solicitors involved.  Your ex and his family will do everything they can to freeze you out.", "Definitely NTA. He wants to deal with it without accountability so that he can run you over. He sounds gross.\n\nCongrats on your freedom, OP!", "NTA\n\nHe was controlling and financially abusive. Go with your gut. I wouldn\u2019t trust him to do the right thing now.", "NTA.\n\nIn listening to this story, I was wondering when the hell you were going to leave with a husband who treats you like a whore, literally, insisting on sexual favors in exchange for money.\n\nHe wants you to do this among yourselves because he's got a more stash hidden than he's letting on and he's afraid a solicitor will get you a much more generous settlement than he would negotiate with you privately.\n\nHe's has every intention of lying about his finances. I expect he'd insist that his investments all went bad, he has gotten very little in return, practically broke, etc.\n\nBut with a solicitor, you will find out exactly how much he has and how much you're entitled to. I never thought I would see myself saying this, but I hope you soak him for everything he's got, after years of his financial abuse of you.", "NTA but you\u2019re not necessarily right either.\n\nDealing exclusively with lawyers can make the divorce not only more expensive but significantly more contentious as well.\n\nConsult with a lawyer, ask for advice. They can suggest what documents to ask for, what you might be entitled to, etc..  Then negotiate personally with your ex husband and review with the lawyer before you sign anything.  If you don\u2019t get anywhere, you can hand it all over to the lawyers.", "Sounds like he wants to continue to be financially secretive and pull the wool over your eyes. Get it into the legal system where there are consequences for lack of transparency. You\u2019re not a gold digger. A few weeks without all the support you provided at home *after a work day* will demonstrate that to him. You want what you helped build by supporting his foundation: home and family. Congrats on getting out!", "NTA. Of course he is calling names. He has lost control and is about to lose 1/2 of what the two of you have built together. Don't discount your contributions just because it wasn't monetary.", "NTA. The more you hear the gold digging part, ask for more. You deserve what you deserve and nothing less. If they get mad, let then stay mad!", "NTA.\n\nRemember what you said in the first paragraph. Financial control and emotional abuse. You are now facing a new version of the same thing.\n\nStand firm on the lawyer. Not only are you doing this for yourself but also for your child. You need all the support you can get.\n\nAnd make certain your lawyer is aware of the financial control your husband had.

She doesn\u2019t know what assets could be there, what documents to request, how much the law says she\u2019s entitled to or when her ex is lying to her about what he has. Attorneys go to school and train to do those things. They can\u2019t be taught to her during a brief conversation.", "Get a lawyer when you have assets. Especially in this when it sounds like OP doesn\u2019t know the full extent of their finances.", "He was financially, sexually, and emotionally abusive. You don't negotiate with that. And the abuse has obviously not stopped - why do you think his people are calling her to call her names?", "Facts! I forgot to comment on that part.", "She should definitely get a lawyer if she\u2019s uncomfortable talking to him on her own or if she feels she\u2019s not getting anywhere.\n\nYes, it is important for OP to get the financial resources she needs.  But there\u2019s also an emotional cost/toll to consider.  Settling it in 6 months vs 2 years has value, both in the monetary savings of not paying the lawyer and the emotional toll proceedings can take.  Not to mention, that when all communications go through lawyers, that\u2019s not only about the money, that means discussions about the child do too.\n\nI feel like the people who say \u201cget a lawyer, destroy him\u201d haven\u2019t been through the emotional exhaustion that doing that causes"]}
