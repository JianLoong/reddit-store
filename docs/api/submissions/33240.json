When we separated (about 3 years ago) Jennifer moved to a different state, and last year I moved there too so that we didn't have to keep going back and forth for visitation. \n\nLast year we all drove back to our home state together for Christmas, and Jennifer stayed at her brother's house with Raya, except for one night when I had Raya at my mom's to go skiing the next day. We opened presents at my mom's that night and at my dad's the next day after skiing. She went back to Jennifer's brother's house after that until we drove back. The roads were hell and we agreed when we got home that next year (this year) we'd fly. The plan has always been to go back home for Christmas, especially since Raya misses her cousins and grand-parents. I wanted to go for her birthday too, but we couldn't afford it. The trip back has been mentioned repeatedly throughout the year, stuff like \"when we go back to \\[Home City\\] we'll do this\", or the like.\n\nA few months ago, Jennifer's family told her she \"doesn't need to bother with Christmas\" and sort of unofficially disinvited her. Or at least that's the way she told it to me. She also says she can't afford a plane ticket. She's complained a bunch about how she's mad at her family and hurt they aren't including her, and that she's upset she'll be spending Christmas alone. But she never asked me to change my plans.\n\nI booked our flights in November and sent her the dates. Again she complained about her family and not being able to afford a plane ticket anyway, but otherwise didn't say anything.\n\nOur flight is today (I'm writing this from the airport). 30 minutes before I was supposed to pick up Raya she texts me that she's \"hurt and angry because I never asked if I could take her for Christmas.\" She says \"it's unfair because you (meaning me) got her last year,\" and that I'm \"ignoring her parental rights.\" I maintain that this has been the plan all year, we've spoken about it repeatedly throughout the year, and I sent her the dates a month in advance. If she had a problem with the plan, it was her responsibility to communicate that, not to expect me to infer that from her complaining about her family or even about being alone for the holiday.  She cussed me out, called me a bunch of names, told me she hates me, and to \"just go.\"\n\nWe have a mutual friend who's staying with her to help her out while I'm gone (we live in a very rural area and despite our divorce I do a lot of maintenance and animal care around her property), and another mutual friend gave me and Raya a ride to the airport.

If you are married, part of the job is to anticipate your partner's feelings, read your partner's moods, etc.  If the two of you are divorce co-parents, then that duty doesn't exist anymore.  Instead, the two of you need to communicate clearly and succinctly.  You are right.  If Jennifer was worried about being alone for the holidays, or wanted to spend holidas with Raya because her family has exiled her, or wanted to amend your plans for some reason, she should have said something clear to you.

By \u2018you got her last year\u2019, did she mean that Raya spent actual Christmas Day with you? And even though she stayed at her uncle\u2019s house for all but one night, how much time was she spending with you while you were both in town for the holidays?  Also, did you specifically discuss the dates and you booking the flight to go home before you booked, or did you just send her an FYI? And if the latter, why?  Finally, what is the legal custody agreement here - who legally has her for this holiday, and have there been any variations to this?\n\nIt is unfortunate, but I would caution you going forward to discuss things in writing and thinking about how to approach these kinds of things differently - have some way of being firm on some things where applicable, have some way to give a no objection period before plans are finalised etc. This is partly to get her to be less wishy washy, and partly to protect yourself so she doesn\u2019t pull these things after the fact.

Next year though is HER year. \n\nAnd you probably need to stop acting as her sort-of husband. It\u2019s confusing things. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou do have IN WRITING - where she agreed that you were taking your daughter - don't you??  \n\nI'm a formerly single mom.   We let each other know EVERY SINGLE TIME  we took our kid somewhere.  We never took the other person, but we let them know where our kid was going to be. \n\nThis should be covered in your custody agreement as part of your divorce.   Kids are not allowed to travel out of state without the permission of the other parent.   But the other parent does NOT get to cancel the kid's travel at the last minute because they wanted you to offer a free plane ticket.\n\nDon't put your friends in the middle of this.  Consult the attorney who wrote up your custody agreement.  You need to get this documented.   Her instability is terrifying.  You don't want her to say that you kidnapped your child without her permission just because she wanted you to buy her a plane ticket.", "So I guess the question is, do you have a custody agreement and if so who was Raya supposed to spend Christmas with? I f you can't figure out from everything your ex said about not being invited and not being able to afford it then that's on you, sure she didn't outright tell you but if she said Raya couldn't would you have painted here as the bad guy?", "In the back of my head I wonder if she thought her complaints about not being able to afford a flight would guilt you into buying her a flight as well. She never suggested your daughter not go because she secretly wanted you to take her as well. NTA", ">we live in a very rural area and despite our divorce I do a lot of maintenance and animal care around her property\n\nIs your ex wife ill or disabled?  Are these tasks she is physically unable to do?", "You're NTA for sticking to the plan you both had all year, but you could have been more empathetic to your ex-wife's situation. It sounds like she's going through a rough time and could have used some support from you. Maybe next time, try to be a bit more understanding and communicate more openly with her.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I need to go and find some popcorn to enjoy this drama unfolding. Good luck, and may the force be with you, or at least not against you.", "She never mentioned her daughter not getting to go. OP was running under the assumption they were putting HER needs first. She had months to communicate more than sulking.", "What happens when u get a partner ? This dynamic will get wierd soon", "No where in the post does it even say that he had her on Christmas. It says one night, but not that that night was Christmas", "Thank you, Captain Abelist. \n\nWhat a vapid, immature pile of bullshit. No one should be reading anyone's mood. Two adults should have the maturity and respect for each other to open their fucking mouths and communicate. It's the literal foundation of a safe, healthy relationship. Not some fanfiction of reading them like the shitty book you got that crap out of.\n\nOf course, that would be effort and given your posts, I can understand why you might find that a foreign concept.", "Did you see the part where I said technically? And since they opened presents at his mom's that night, and then opened presents at his dad's the next day, I'd be willing to bet they spent a good portion of Christmas with his side of the family.  I also wouldn't be surprised if it actually was his Christmas last year, but that he saw it as a group Christmas. Divorce makes people do dumb things and she probably is intentionally ignoring the fact that it was more of a split holiday that shouldn't be counted as one or the other.", "I'm not sure why you're lashing out over something so basic to human life. My guess is that you have trouble with reading people, which is not surprising and points to the one flaw in my statement. I should have said, \"you ***probably*** don't know them well enough,\" because the fact is that there are a lot of people (presumably like you) who don't have that ability, and of course they can still get married and be quite happy, but I'm guessing it is much more work if you don't have that ability. And not for nothing but the average person can, in fact, read other people (the opposite is quite rare, to be honest), and usually people who are in serious relationships can, in fact, read each other. It's not fanfiction, although to someone who thinks it's make-believe, I wouldn't be surprised if they have trouble understanding it.", "OP clarified in another comment that it was the night of Christmas, but that the mom had her until the afternoon. So technically they both had her for Christmas.", "He actually said he picked up Raya after lunch on Christmas Day, but then had her for the rest of Christmas. That means his ex had her in the morning, but most of that morning was likely spent sleeping. I'd be surprised if she had more than 5 or 6 waking hours with Raya, and then OP picked her up around 1 or 2 and had her for the rest of the night, which his ex probably sees as HIM having the lion's share of the day. As such, the ex probably has arbitrarily decided that he technically had her, so now it's her year, ignoring the fact that last year didn't actually even count. \n\nTo be clear, my only point about this was that the ex thinks custody last year matters. It doesn't. She's just grasping at straws to create drama."]}
