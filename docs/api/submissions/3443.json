But it doesn\u2019t sound like you are lol. And that\u2019s also totally fine.", "If he gets offend that you tell him his house is a garbage pit rethink this relationship....would you want to marry him and then down the line something happens and he tells you the ILs need to move in with y'all and next thing you know they done trashed your house and he finds nothing wrong with it.", "Someone is going to be offended in this scenario. At the moment it's you, and you're not being unreasonable.", "If you can't be honest with him - not mean but HONEST - you should not be in a relationship. \n\nYou don't have to say that the house is a disgusting fucking pig sty and unfit for human habitation but you CAN say that you aren't comfortable entering the house or spending time there because of serious hazards to your health. \n\nBut I have news for you, your bf is NOT the clean person inside a prison of filth that you think he is. He let the room get disgusting again within weeks of it being clean. He is like the rest of his family, and likes when you clean up after him.\n\nIf he were truly willing to commit to being clean and hygienic, his room would be SPARKLING. \n\nYOU WILL BE CLEANING UP AFTER HIM FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. \n\nNTA but you do not have to commit to this person. Frankly, you deserve better than an absolutely disgusting, filthy environment. I would die on this hill.", "He isn\u2019t worried about offending your sensibilities by having his brothers wet underwear on the floor.", "So then communicate very well and tell him that you\u2019re uncomfortable spending so much time there.", "If you both communicate so well, why is this whole post about you walking on eggshells and being too scared to tell him the truth, in case you offend him?", "Yikes. So in addition to everything else, they're running a mini farm and slaughterhouse in there? Run away. But get the bunnies out first.", "Omg I\u2019m gonna block you you\u2019re annoying me atp IT\u2019S MY OPINION STFU", "Ahh yes, the science; trust the ever changing science. I'm in America, and the people that put it straight under the tap and/or use paper towels are dumb. They'll learn the hard way.", "Lol nice try", "of course i\u2019m not no sane person would be in afraid \ud83d\ude05", "but if i tell him now and later down the line the in laws have to move in. wouldn\u2019t they still be moving in?", "lol shut me up real quick", "it\u2019s the cats, they\u2019re killers", "Imagine thinking your opinion is better than actual science. Wait till you find out about the bacteria *in* the chicken. Good luck washing that out.", "The position on washing chicken in the US has been relatively consistent for a few decades, from food safety boards to the companies that litigate cases about foodborne illness. You'll excuse me for choosing to trust the preponderance of evidence against there being any genuine benefit to washing chicken that isn't personal.", "Haha yeah, you\u2019re not mean. Of course phrase it gently, but honestly? Just tell him the truth and see what he says.\n\nIf he gets defensive about it though, that means he thinks it\u2019s fine and will be fine living like that when he gets his own place. So probably run now \ud83d\ude02", "You really have an issue here if you can't tell the truth....stop trying to sugar coat this crap and tell him your house is fckn nasty", "No.. it\u2019s your house you can say no. And knowing what you know about how they live I would never let them move in with me. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to wash chicken.. but if their house is that disgusting I don\u2019t even know why you are staying there. Even though you say your boyfriends room is clean he must be ok with living like that if he eats there and acts like everything is normal. You need to sit down and have a very serious discussion and just be honest and if he takes it the wrong way then you need to think about if you really want to be in a relationship with someone who is ok living in a pigsty.", "why would you ever let your in laws move in with you?? I wouldnt let *my parents* live with me if I lived with a partner unless they were elderly! also you're waaay too young to be thinking about \"what if we get married and his family moves in with us\" hypotheticals\n\nsigned, someone who also thought like you when I was your age lol", "It\u2019s the facts. You\u2019re not an AH, you have preferences on your lifestyle. He\u2019s not an AH, he was raised like that. No one\u2019s a jerk here.  You\u2019re different people.  You\u2019re going to need to speak up for yourself now. You\u2019re unhappy sleeping there.", "You do you", "no we\u2019ve talked about it before. his room was really messy and once he and i spent the whole day cleaning it. after a few weeks it got pretty messy again and he said that he hated knowing how clean it could be and he let it get to this point", "thank you"]}
