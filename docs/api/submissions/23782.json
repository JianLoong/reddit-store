It doesn\u2019t seem like the kid is doing anything other than being a little grumpy and passive aggressive, which is very normal for a 13 year old. \n\nWhy offer to watch the kids just to try to get rid of the oldest one for seemingly no reason? As soon as your brother said \u201cno\u201d that should have been the end of it. You don\u2019t have to understand his reluctance. You brought up having the kid stay home alone, the parent said no, and you\u2026argued? \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to watch the kids, don\u2019t watch the kids.

It is telling him what you will, and will not agree to do to help him in the future.\n\n In that respect both of your last answers are unreasonable. \n\nAnyways you yourself have a right to decide the extent of your help, he can either take it or leave it altogether. HE is in no way entitled to more than you are willing to offer and you are not the AH for not offering things you are uncomfortable with. \n\nNAH I guess as you both escalated the argument unnecessarily but in the end, he's probably just a concerned parent and you were just pushed too hard while already helping quite a lot honestly.", "He\u2019s 13, that\u2019s plenty old enough to be left alone.

At least from that you could then determine if you are willing to accept it and continue letting him come over. If his reasoning isn't valid enough for you to change your mind, then he should take on the expense of paid daycare for that child.  If he cops an attitude about the situation, he should then pony up for the other two.  Them being at your house is not a favor to you, quite the opposite, and he needs to be made to remember that.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe should not lose sight of the fact that you are doing this man an enormous favor in providing daycare for his kids, after providing an enormous favor of securing his mortgage.", "YTA\n\n13 is too young to be left alone all day.

What if he was hurt, what if he chose to leave the house without anyone knowing etc - like I could go on and on with what ifs because quite simply 13 is too young for him to reliably know what to do in given situation.\n\nBut the fact is, and what makes you the AH is that you're not the parent, so you don't get to make this decision.  And furthermore... You said to your brother that if he brought Dane to your house, you would just take him back to be alone at his.... So now, you're threatening to leave the child alone, which is directly against his father's wishes. Sorry but that's not your call to make. \n\nNo, you don't have to look after your brother's children, you are not obligated to do that. However if you do choose to look after them then that has to be following your brother's safety rules, whether you like them or not.  \n\nUnfortunately at 13 teenagers can be moody as hell, so, if you choose to have them over to look after them, youre going to just have to put up with that!", "NTA\nThe last comment was unnecessary.

The kid clearly articulated to this man he doesn't like being there and just wants to be at home.\n\n\n\n\nYou are once again mistaken when y ou say that he said \"no\" and that should be the end of it.  Who's receiving the enormous benefit of unpaid daycare, and who's providing that daycare?  The uncle owes the father NOTHING.

The uncle advocated on his behalf for what the kid wanted.  The uncle doesn't want someone under his roof that doesn't want to be there.  He argued with a man who said he wanted it his way, and that's that.   He ultimately got pissed and said.. Hey.. just don't bring him anymore.. period.  Seems reasonable to me considering its the uncle's time and house.\n\n\n\n\nAnd then.. the icing on the cake.. You throw in that he is picking on a guy having a tough time already..

All I see is the cold hard facts that the uncle wants the eldest kid out of his home, the father doesn't want him alone at his home, and expects the uncle to take him regardless of how he feels about it, and finally the uncle stating flatly, \"you bring him over, I will just take him back, so don't bring him over.\"", "Depends on the 13yo.

Sure. But trusted adults were next door to go to for help. And nothing major. \n\nBut I get it if the 13yo is prone to getting into trouble and you can\u2019t trust them. But that\u2019s not all 13yo. \n\nIt\u2019s miserable as a kid when you have no agency over where you go for the day and what you do.

I was left alone as young as 10 sometimes.  Guess what.. I made it along with thousands of other kids in the same boat.  If there is an accident?  The uncle is 5 miles away, 911 is also a thing (that I never had).   What if the child leaves without anyone knowing?  What if.. never killed me, and he apparently could just as easily do it at his uncle's house.  This is sort of why successive generations have become weak, lethargic, and timid.  Everyone is ringing their hands coddling, and shielding kids from adversity.  FFS.. the government wants to let 26 year old adults stay on parent's insurance and remain dependents... \n\n\n\n\nVery astutely you have stated that he is not the parent, he does not get to make the call on what the kids do or don't do.  Now let me make an astute observation.. He is the guy who takes care of them at 0 expense every day  (as a parent would do), as an extreme benefit and favor to their father.  You act as if this guy owes the father something, when the reality is that he has done nothing but be selfless and provide him life saving favors.  He may not make decisions about the raising of those kids, but he absolutely is the one who makes the call of who does or does not come into his home, who he does or does not take responsibility for watching.  I find it funny you take exception to him bringing the child back to his own house, what should he do.. drop him off in the street, or at an arcade?  If he rejects the kid being in his home, the father doesn't get to hold him hostage by just dropping the kid off assuming that he will let him in cause he has no choice.\n\n\n\n\nAh.. and now we have total agreement.  He does not have to watch his kids, no obligation.  He has to choose, and clearly he has chosen to watch 2, not the 3rd anymore.  The father needs to respect that and appreciate that he is still watching the 2 for free.  Maybe find other arrangements for the 3rd.\n\n\n\n\nYah, teens are typically moodie little asshats, but again, this guy has recognized that, and that he does not want someone who does not want to be around him or in his house, in his house.  He's voiced it to the guardian, the guardian is trying to impose his will in someone else's home by making the guy take a kid he doesn't want there anymore.   He doesn't have to put up with anything.  Their father needs to find another place for his eldest to be, and if he wants to cop an attitude about it, find a place for the other two as well, and the money to pay for that other place.", "OP is being an asshole by refusing to babysit this one child *(especially when it\u2019s just because the child wants to stay home.)* And by saying they will drop the child back off at their home without supervision and without consent.

And it's not her call to make.", "Yowza. Tldr. Sorry", "but OP informed him in advance they won't be watching the oldest anymore, he would be an AH if he brings the boy even after being informed. You can't strong arm people to watch your kids against their will by bringing the kid and leaving him there ....what's so difficult about understanding that? \n\nAnd the boy does not want to be there hence OPs uncomfortable with having him there as well, it is not OPs kid and I dare to say lots of people are unwilling to watch over a teen who does not want to be at their house ... OP has a right to refuse free babysitting if it is an inconvenience.\n\nSure the father can insist they're a package deal, in which case he should find a proper childcare for all three of them.

I seriously doubt OP will try to stop him fro doing so. Nobody's really making him do anything. \n\nAgain he can't push his kid on a person who does not feel comfortable with it, that is that. That's not negotiable. \n\nMy partner's parents also refused to babysit our oldest as it was their first time babysitting the small one overnight and they were too nervous to have another distraction. Hence we had to find another childcare for the oldest.

OP even told brother in advance that they can't babysit him because he doesn't want to be babysit.\n\nOP is providing a valuable service to their sibling but that doesn't mean that they have lost the right to say no to situation which is likely to be turned unpleasant for them.\n\nAnyhow OP last sentence was unnecessary.
