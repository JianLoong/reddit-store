I bought my wedding dress weeks ago. His my (FMIL) kept petering me abput trying it on but I firmly refused. I finally shut it down after she offered me 100$ to let her try it on. Her reasoning for presisting so much? She says it's because of her \"love\" for wedding dresses and her obsession with them.\n\n\nFast forward to yesterday, I came home from work early and I found my fiance at home. He freaked out after seeing me and tried to prevent me from going into my room while trying to text somebody on his phone. I opened the door and was shocked to see his mom standing there wearing my dress. I instantly pulled out my phone and took a photo of her in it. Sheand my fiance freaked out after I told her that she needed to pay me for a new dress in 3 days or else I'll show the family the photo. She started crying and thrn left and my fiance blew up at me saying I can't be serious and that I overreacted because his mom just wanted to try the dress on, no harm done. But I refused to listen to him because in my opinion, the dress should only be worn by the bride and the bride only. quite frankly, I felt disgusted looking at the dress again, I don't want it anymore. And so I think it's fair that she pays me after she ruined it for me. He yelled at mr and told me to wake up and stop treating his mom like that. We had a fight after he failed to get me to back down and he's been staying with his mom since then.\n\nI felt awful, but I spent 3k on this dress and worked hard yo get it, I can't stand looking at it but people in my family think I'm escalating things and risking my relationship with not only FMIL but my fiance as well.\n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1691087372, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15hbw8d/aita_for_giving_fmil_3_days_to_pay_me_for_a_new/", "score": 802, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I bought my wedding dress weeks ago. His my (FMIL) kept petering me abput trying it on but I firmly refused. I finally shut it down after she offered me 100$ to let her try it on. Her reasoning for presisting so much? She says it's because of her \"love\" for wedding dresses and her obsession with them.\n\n\nFast forward to yesterday, I came home from work early and I found my fiance at home. He freaked out after seeing me and tried to prevent me from going into my room while trying to text somebody on his phone. I opened the door and was shocked to see his mom standing there wearing my dress. I instantly pulled out my phone and took a photo of her in it. Sheand my fiance freaked out after I told her that she needed to pay me for a new dress in 3 days or else I'll show the family the photo. She started crying and thrn left and my fiance blew up at me saying I can't be serious and that I overreacted because his mom just wanted to try the dress on, no harm done. But I refused to listen to him because in my opinion, the dress should only be worn by the bride and the bride only. quite frankly, I felt disgusted looking at the dress again, I don't want it anymore. And so I think it's fair that she pays me after she ruined it for me. He yelled at mr and told me to wake up and stop treating his mom like that. We had a fight after he failed to get me to back down and he's been staying with his mom since then.\n\nI felt awful, but I spent 3k on this dress and worked hard yo get it, I can't stand looking at it but people in my family think I'm escalating things and risking my relationship with not only FMIL but my fiance as well.\n\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
