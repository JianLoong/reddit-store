I'm very sorry MIL that not only did you break a promise, you got the color wrong since I said a girl.  This will never happen again. Sorry", "NTA\n\nI totally understand that you don't want to damage the relationship with your MIL over this. But do you really want to apologize for being in the right? Wouldn't it be healthier going forward to have an honest conversation?\n\nI am guessing in her mind she was doing you a favor for making sure you received \"gender appropriate\" gifts. Was she wrong for lying and deciding you need that: yes. Were her intentions malicious: probably not?\n\nMaybe talk about that without accusations or apologies on your part in the hope of understanding each other better in the future?\n\nCongratulations on the baby boy!", "NTA and don't apologize. If anything MIL should apologize for lying to you if she want any time with the grandkid.", "NTA. it\u2019s kind of hilarious how hard karma hit her lmao. she has no one to blame but herself for the embarrassment she\u2019s facing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is amazing.\n\nMaybe just cause I hate gender reveals but omg this made me laugh so hard. A true lesson for your MIL to keep her mouth shut.\n\nPeople should buy mostly gender neutral stuff for babies anyways tbh. They're just weird little gremlins at first.", "NTA\n\nShe embarrassed herself. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry you embarrassed yourself by lying\u201d is about the only apology I\u2019d be willing to give.", "NTA\n\n\n\n\"Yes, I lied to you. But how you dare lie to me?\" Lol. Your husband needs a spine.", "So his side insisted on having a gender reveal, but all of them were under the assumption that they already knew the gender because of your MIL\u2026 Like what was even the point? NTA", "She sounds like fun", "NTA for you. This worked out to be the best sequence of events. I would have paid money to be there", "NTA and please don\u2019t apologise to her. Your husband should have your back and put your feelings above hers. Remind him she harassed you until you just told her something to make her go away, it was emotional self defence.", "NTA. Also, never apologise to keep the peace - the person who breaks the peace should be the only one apologising! In case your husband is confused, that would be his mother, who not only harassed you unrelentingly until you picked a gender at random, but also broke a promise of secrecy. \n\nIf she's embarrassed, it's the result of her own bad behaviour. And if she apologises, then you can be magnanimous and forgive her. But you absolutely should not apologise to her.", "NTA.\n\nWell played. I\u2019m sorry you have such an annoying MIL who lies thru her teeth.", "NTA.  Brilliant no-lose scenario for you.  I would\u2019ve told her it was a panda bear but I\u2019ll bet yours provided more peace during the pregnancy.", "NTA\n\nTime for a fauxpology.\n\nTell her you\u2019re sorry she didn\u2019t accept your repeated assurances that you didn\u2019t know the gender and that you weren\u2019t holding anything back from her. Tell her that you\u2019re sorry you felt you had no other choice to get her off your case. Tell her that you\u2019re sorry she feels embarrassed that she broke her promise.\n\nAnd tell her that you\u2019ll be ready to accept her apology for both hounding you and lying about not sharing the information with anyone when she\u2019s ready to give it.", "If you apologise now you'll be apologising for the rest of her life. NTA. I'm metaphorically side-eyeing your husband though. Is he always willing to sacrifice you on the alter of his mother's ego?", "NTA\n\nWell played", "NTA\n\nShe played a stupid game and won a stupid prize. \n\n\nHigh-five for that quick thinking and congrats on the baby!", "NTA. \n\nIt's always funny when karma bites back lmao. This will hopefully show your MIL to keep her mouth shut in certain situations.  Congrats on the baby!", "NTA. Apologize to \"keep the peace\" if you must but only after the MIL does.", "NTA. MIL lied and she\u2019s mad you beat her at her own game. You don\u2019t owe her an apology. And you certainly didn\u2019t owe her an answer ahead of time. Once she extracted what she wanted from you, she proceeded to blab. And she not only lied, now, she\u2019s manipulating the situation to look like a victim who\u2019s owed an apology. Definitely NTA.", "NTA. What tf is the damn point of a gender reveal party if she\u2019s gonna tell everyone beforehand??? She deserved being made a fool of.", "NTA congrats and best wishes for a safe delivery! \n\nMiL played the FAFO game. She doesn't deserve an apology whatsoever, nor does she deserve to be told secret or private information going forward. She can't be trusted.", "NTA, tell her you are sorry she made a fool of herself.", "NTA\n\nAnd I'm sick of people being told they should apologise when they did nothing wrong in order to keep the peace.\n\nBeing forced to appease bullies / people who break boundaries is harmful. Submerging yourself to please others is harmful. Not having the person who did wrong held to account is harmful.", "How did they think this would play out?\n\n\u2018Oh wow it\u2019s a girl! What a surprising surprise we had no idea. Here is a bundle of pink frilly dresses as a gift that we brought!\u2019", "NTA. She should not have lied.", "NTA\n\nIf anyone needs to apologise it's her, not you.", "NTA\n\nThis calls for a politician-style apology. Tell her that you're sorry this upset her. Tell her you're sorry you couldn't think of a better way to get her to stop pestering you.", "NTA. Love that you had the receipts to catch her in the lie. Maybe don\u2019t lie in the first place? Easy.", "NTA. Her face must have been a picture! \n\nMIL harassed you (hope it doesn't get worst once baby is here), lied and had no intention of keeping her word. You told the truth, she embarrassed herself... But most importantly she broke your trust. I would ask your husband how you are supposed to trust his mum in the future if she intentionally lies and try to sabotage things or cares about your wishes (it was a gender reveal party and the all point is guest not knowing)... \n\nShe should be the one apologizing big time...", "NTA. She lied and is now upset that people found out about it. Let her apologise to \"keep the peace.\"", "NTA. But I\u2019d have just told her something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019ve already said I don\u2019t know the gender. I\u2019m not sure how else to get you to wrap your head around such a simple fact. Since we\u2019ve been over this a dozen times already, I am no longer going to repeat myself and will simply ignore any further inquiries regarding the matter\u201d rather than lying to her. Seems like an odd decision to me. Still NTA. But I guess she can apologize to you for lying and you can apologize to her for lying \u00af\\\\\\_ (\u30c4)\\_/\u00af  Just in my personal experience lying basically never pays off. So if I were you, I\u2019d avoid it 99% of the time, it just causes more problems than it solves. Would\u2019ve been better to be bluntly honest even if its a bit \u2018rude\u2019 at first than just make something up to placate her. But she said she was gonna keep it a secret, so you\u2019re not responsible for any of the repercussions of her breaking that promise (bunch of people getting the wrong gifts). It\u2019s just a good example of how lying often has unintended consequences. But ultimately those consequences fall on your MIL\u2019s back in this case."]}
