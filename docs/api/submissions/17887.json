Do NOT set a precedent whereby she's entitled to do whatever she wants and you have to agree to \"keep the peace.\" That's toxic bullshit.\n\nHave a long talk with your husband about why he's defending his mother's atrocious behavior -- not just the lying, but the constant harassment prior! Where was he when she was hounding you about the baby's gender? Why did he not put a stop to it right then? And why of all things does he think YOU should apologize to HER, and not vice versa?\n\nIf he keeps putting his mother first,- and yes, he's definitely putting her way ahead of you - then you will never be able to set any boundaries with your MIL. \n\nDon't want her posting pictures on Facebook? Too bad! Don't want her to be the person to take your kid to their first haircut? Oopsie, it just happened lol gosh! Want to plan the first birthday party yourself? Looks like MIL invited all her friends, and is gonna elbow you out of pictures! And your husband's just going to stand there uselessly and tell you not to get mad, she's just like that, you know?\n\nSit your husband down and tell him it's time to start acting like a husband and father.

She brought all of this on herself by not accepting that you didn\u2019t know, and then running around telling everyone when she said she wouldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t exactly understand her end game besides thinking it gave her family the upper hand to have gendered gifts and making her feel special for knowing. \n\n\nWe kept our kids name a secret, partly because we didn\u2019t wanna deal with snide comments and partly because we honestly didn\u2019t have a set name. But one thing I wanted was to give our kid my grandmas name as his middle name, Jackie btw. The one person we told was my mother and I told her absolutely no one is allowed to know. Guess what she announced at my baby shower and gave me a little happy smirk when people awed? So our kid has a completely different middle name than planned. She asked why we didn\u2019t go with the middle name we wanted in the hospital, and I just shrugged and was like yea we changed our minds but I could tell she knew why and was embarrassed because she was gonna have to tell everyone she was wrong. She hasn\u2019t pulled shit like that with me since so I\u2019d continue doing what you\u2019re doing without apologizing until she gets the hint. \n\n\nLet her make an ass out of herself.

You don't have a MIL problem you have a big, hooting and tooting husband problem and once kiddo is born it will only get worse.

How he grows that spine and whether he needs professional help to do so is up to him, but he needs to do this and he needs to start now!\n\nDo. Not. Back. Down.\n\nDo. Not.

Then said that her own documented lie was <*checks notes*> your attempt to make her look bad?\n\n\nI am stunned, honestly, at the sheer stupidity.\n\n\nAnd I am deeply disappointed that your husband, an adult and about to be a parent, thinks you should apologize.\n\n\nBut: my real concern is your future and your baby's future. Your MIL is going to get worse, not better.\n\n\nYour husband will take her side \"to keep the peace\".  2 on 1 isn't a fair fight. You will always lose and, I'm afraid, so will your baby, ultimately.\n\n\nWithout a major course correction now with your husband, at v least, the kid will witness manipulative lying as a successful life strategy, making a scene and lying some more as the right way to handle getting caught, and demanding apologies \"to keep the peace\" as the icing on the cake.\n\n\nIt's a pattern. In interviews, cyclists who rode with Lance Armstrong said he attacked the reputation of anyone accusing him of doping and demanded apologies.", "NTA. Don't apologise for her mistake and big mouth. This will teach her not to push you ever again. Keep your boundaries up especially with the birth. Don't tell her until the baby is born. Tell your husband to grow a spine. He can't please 2 women.

If you apologize this time, this may be your husbands go to in the future when MIL tries to pull stuff regarding your child. Good luck dealing with this type of MIL. Your husband has to realize his priories is with his fam now (you and baby) not his extended (mil etc)", "NTA \n\nShe doesn't respect you and an apology will actually make that worse, because then she will feel morally superior to someone she already disrespects.

In earlier decades there were a lot more neutrals for infant stuff and the gendered clothing kicked in around 6 months -  year. \n\n(In even earlier centuries, all infants were dressed alike, in dresses. Boys were 'breeched' - given their first pair of pants - once toilet trained. Many family portraits from the 16th - 19th centuries show kids we'd read as toddler girls who are actually toddler boys.) \n\n\\- Much higher use of molded injection plastics for kid furniture means it can be coloured brightly. Nurseries move away from being solid wood rocking horses and chairs, etc, to more plastics.\n\n\\- A lot more money floating around in the west in the 1980s, along with a consumption-heavy culture, led to a lot of people buying a lot more baby and kid stuff, and the kid-market grew immensely.\n\n\\- Targeted ads at the grandparent market who were now buying gendered items for unborn babies (see above re: ultrasounds).\n\n\\- Capitalism. Specifically marketing targeting families who already had a kid. Make 'em believe that it will damage Billy to be dressed in Susie's hand-me-downs, and you make twice the money off of one family.
