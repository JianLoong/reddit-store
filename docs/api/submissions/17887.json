Do NOT set a precedent whereby she's entitled to do whatever she wants and you have to agree to \"keep the peace.\" That's toxic bullshit.\n\nHave a long talk with your husband about why he's defending his mother's atrocious behavior -- not just the lying, but the constant harassment prior! Where was he when she was hounding you about the baby's gender? Why did he not put a stop to it right then? And why of all things does he think YOU should apologize to HER, and not vice versa?\n\nIf he keeps putting his mother first,- and yes, he's definitely putting her way ahead of you - then you will never be able to set any boundaries with your MIL. \n\nDon't want her posting pictures on Facebook? Too bad! Don't want her to be the person to take your kid to their first haircut? Oopsie, it just happened lol gosh! Want to plan the first birthday party yourself? Looks like MIL invited all her friends, and is gonna elbow you out of pictures! And your husband's just going to stand there uselessly and tell you not to get mad, she's just like that, you know?\n\nSit your husband down and tell him it's time to start acting like a husband and father.

She brought all of this on herself by not accepting that you didn\u2019t know, and then running around telling everyone when she said she wouldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t exactly understand her end game besides thinking it gave her family the upper hand to have gendered gifts and making her feel special for knowing. \n\n\nWe kept our kids name a secret, partly because we didn\u2019t wanna deal with snide comments and partly because we honestly didn\u2019t have a set name. But one thing I wanted was to give our kid my grandmas name as his middle name, Jackie btw. The one person we told was my mother and I told her absolutely no one is allowed to know. Guess what she announced at my baby shower and gave me a little happy smirk when people awed? So our kid has a completely different middle name than planned. She asked why we didn\u2019t go with the middle name we wanted in the hospital, and I just shrugged and was like yea we changed our minds but I could tell she knew why and was embarrassed because she was gonna have to tell everyone she was wrong. She hasn\u2019t pulled shit like that with me since so I\u2019d continue doing what you\u2019re doing without apologizing until she gets the hint. \n\n\nLet her make an ass out of herself.

You don't have a MIL problem you have a big, hooting and tooting husband problem and once kiddo is born it will only get worse.

Then said that her own documented lie was <*checks notes*> your attempt to make her look bad?\n\n\nI am stunned, honestly, at the sheer stupidity.\n\n\nAnd I am deeply disappointed that your husband, an adult and about to be a parent, thinks you should apologize.\n\n\nBut: my real concern is your future and your baby's future. Your MIL is going to get worse, not better.\n\n\nYour husband will take her side \"to keep the peace\".  2 on 1 isn't a fair fight. You will always lose and, I'm afraid, so will your baby, ultimately.\n\n\nWithout a major course correction now with your husband, at v least, the kid will witness manipulative lying as a successful life strategy, making a scene and lying some more as the right way to handle getting caught, and demanding apologies \"to keep the peace\" as the icing on the cake.\n\n\nIt's a pattern. In interviews, cyclists who rode with Lance Armstrong said he attacked the reputation of anyone accusing him of doping and demanded apologies.", "NTA. Don't apologise for her mistake and big mouth.

If you apologize this time, this may be your husbands go to in the future when MIL tries to pull stuff regarding your child. Good luck dealing with this type of MIL. Your husband has to realize his priories is with his fam now (you and baby) not his extended (mil etc)", "NTA \n\nShe doesn't respect you and an apology will actually make that worse, because then she will feel morally superior to someone she already disrespects.

He should\u2019ve been handling this and enforcing boundaries with his pushy, entitled mother this entire time she\u2019s been harassing her. And now he\u2019s telling op to apologize?? Red red red flags. I can only imagine the ways in which he\u2019ll allow his mommy to walk all over his wife in regard to raising their child.", "Yes, exactly this.", "The point was so that the MIL could be the centre of attention. She had the secret information. She was the most important person. All attention was on her.", "This is the way.", "Yeah, I'm worried about the dynamics of that relationship if the husband is standing up for his mother over and above his wife. \n \nShe needs to nip that dynamic in the bud right now.", "And it honestly won't hurt for a boy to wear a pink onesie or a girl to wear a blue one. They'll both just get thrown up on or peed on anyway. I did see one kind lady that took a similar situation and donated all the \"wrong\" colored items to a domestic violence and homeless shelter which I thought was really nice.", "Omg yes. Babies are just babies. I had a female patient the other day (3 months old, approximately 6 lbs) who looked like a grumpy old man. I think she would've looked ridiculous in pink.

If he\u2019s dealt with this his whole life, I can see how he wants to just keep the peace and move on. But he does need to get a spine if he\u2019s gonna be a father soon!", "Exactly! I knew I was having a girl and at my baby shower I asked for gender neutral stuff, my mum co ordinated with everyone invited what they was buying and out the people that said clothes gave each one a size so I had a lovey size selection up to 1 years \ud83e\udd70 I was free to buy the girly dresses I liked and wasn\u2019t rushed in wearing outfits before the babe grew out them as they had got me all the basic base layers \ud83d\ude0d", "DO NOT APOLOGIZE TO KEEP THE PEACE!!!\n\nDon't rock the boat analogy:\n\nWe aren't the ones rocking the boat. It's the crazy lady jumping up and down and running side to side. Not the one sitting in the corner quietly not giving a fuck.\n\nAt some point in her youth, Crazy Woman gave the boat a little nudge. And look how everyone jumped to steady the boat! So she does it again and again and again. Soon her family is in the habit of swaying to counteract the crazy. She moves left, they move right, balance is restored (temporarily). Life goes on. People move on to boats of their own.\n\nThe boat-rocker can't survive in a boat by herself. She's never had to face the consequences of her rocking. She'll tip over. So she finds an enabler: someone so proud of his boat-steadying skills that he secretly (or not so secretly) lives for the rocking.\n\nThe boat-rocker escalates. The boat-steadier can't manage alone, but can't let the boat tip. After all, he's the best boat-steadier ever, and that can't be true if his boat capsizes, so therefore his boat can't capsize. How can they fix the situation?\n\nBallast!\n\nAnd the next generation of boat-steadiers is born. \n\nA born boat-steadier doesn't know what solid ground feels like. He's so used to the constant swaying that anything else feels wrong and he'll fall over. There's a good chance the boat-rocker never taught him how to swim, either. He'll jump at the slightest twitch like his life depends on it, because it did.\n\nWhen you're in their boat, you're expected to help steady it. When you decline, the other boat-steadiers get resentful. Look at you, just sitting there while they do all the work! They don't see that you aren't the one making the boat rock. They might not even see the life rafts available for them to get out. All they know is that the boat can't be allowed to tip, and you're not helping.\n\nNow you and your SO get a boat of your own. With your SO not there, the balance of the boat changes. The remaining boat-steadiers have to work even harder. \n\nWhile a rocking boat is most concerning to those inside, it does cause ripples. The nearby boats start to worry. They're getting splashed! Somebody do something!\n\nSo the flying monkeys are dispatched. Can't you and SO see how much better it is for everyone (else) if you just get back on the boat and keep it steady? It would make their lives so much easier.\n\nYou know what would be easier? If they all just chucked the bitch overboard.", "This is absolutely beautiful. If I knew needlepoint I would make this and bloody frame it.
