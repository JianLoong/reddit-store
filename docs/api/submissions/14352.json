Sister was given a chance to come clean to this ex previously.  Keeping the original comment below but wanted to change the vote\n\n\nESH.  You should have confronted your sister about it first to give her a chance to come clean.  This was also not the time to share that information.  She just got out of a surgery for an ectopic pregnancy and your main concern is whether her boyfriend is there out of guilt?  How is that not shitty?\n\nYour sister is obviously an AH for the lying.  She does sound exhausting but she should have been given an opportunity to come clean.", "ESH - I wouldn\u2019t be getting involved in this mess, yeah she\u2019s a manipulator but he\u2019s hanging around which seems odd given what he knows and you\u2019re less interested in being there to be caring but seemingly just to be a part of what\u2019s going on. Not great", "You think I should apologize to her then? I feel guilty that he official left her, but at the same time I couldn't sit and not tell him the truth. The only reason he stood by her is because she was using his guilt and manipulating him.", "Not sure if I do. She only ever calls us when she needs something or wants something. Before this she would never call me back when I wanted to see how she was doing or answer my texts. But whenever she needed something from me I'm always there to help. I'm going through my own health problems but unlike her and my parents I don't have anyone to fall back on or anyone to be a good support for me. So I just deal with it with my husband on my side.", "She's says she's in therapy. She told her ex that she was in therapy and working on herself which is another reason he was giving her chance so I suspect she only got into therapy to please him. \n\nShe's been to therapy before and always gives up after a shirt time worth of sessions. Even though I told her therapy is a journey that can last years. It took me 2 years of therapy to be in a better place. It's not a 2 week journey and giving up after.", "Yeah, I can admit I was wrong on that part. The only reason why I told him she was pregnant before with another man is because she told him this was her first pregnancy in order to guilt him. Loosing your first pregnancy is tough on anyone. And she did lie to him that she was infertile. And that her Dr. Told her she's infertile. She refused to go on birth control too. That's why she's had multiple miscarriages and abortions. I was wrong but as a mom having a son I don't thinking I could have put up with those lies. I never want a girl to do this to my son. Do you think I should apologize to her?", "I actually spoke to her about this before. The issue is that she didn't just manipulate him but also my parents. My parents think it's all his fault. And her ex thought it was all our fault. She pinned up against each other and I realized that when he and I spoke.", "He left her yesterday after I left. I was there because she called me to be there and my parents are out of town. I work for 14 hours straight and spoke to the Dr and they said she was going to be discharged. I went there to not just be there but also take her home with me so I can care for her until my parents found the first flight back home. From the mintue I got there and told her I'll take her home with me she was very rude and said she didn't want to go with me. Even though I live closer to the hospital and can care for her in her recovery. And I felt annoyed because from the start she was dismissive and rude. I went with good intentions. We thought she was sleeping when we had the conversation.", "Well, you could apologize for discussing her medical history, but the rest of it isn't wrong, and it sounds like it'd just open a can of worms because she would draw no distinction. She absolutely treated her boyfriend badly, and it's his choice to leave her. I doubt he left her over the medical disclosures; she was manipulating him into staying with her, probably in a wide variety of ways.\n\nSo, although medical information shouldn't be disclosed, you should not take responsibility for her boyfriend leaving her.\n\nIt sounds reasonable for you to limit contact with her, as she seems to emotionally manipulate you too.", "What would you even apologize for?  You seem pretty pleased about what you did.", "I don't think you were wrong to disclose her previous pregnancies. She lied about her infertility, almost certainly with the intent to \"trap\" her BF. You were sharing what directly impacts him. \n\nThe only reason to apologize here is to make yourself feel better. I don't think it will matter one way or the other to your sister; she seems to only value others for what they can give to her, and your apology doesn't affect that.", "Well that changes everything.  I\u2019m sorry your sister sucks so much", "No I'm not necessarily pleased with the outcome. I don't regret telling him the truth but I regret that it's my fault he left her. I'm feeling guilty because maybe it wasn't the right time to expose her. I was just very upset at reliazing what my sister was doing. I'm a boy mom for for that moment the mom part of me took over than being a sister. If I was a sister I couldn't just shut up and spoke to her in privately and hoped she would do the right thing. But I felt so bad for the guy.... I don't know I'm confused and tired.", "Info are you in her dr appointments with her? Where did you get her medical info? Was she fake sleeping or dozing? \nYour posts all reak of idk... do you have other issues with your sister?", "Her therapist visits no. I always keep updated and usually she tells me she's stopped going or ect. And her abortions o know because two times she was pregnant I was the one there. And she was fake sleeping. She was wide awake when she yelled at me. And I have alot of issues with my sister. She only calls us when she needs something but could go months without answering our calls to see if she's okay. And she always has issues with her bfs and then comes to us for a few days. We advise her and then she goes back to the same thing ignoring us until she needs us. My issue is that she hates people getting in her business but involves us herself but telling things and asking for help.", "NTA. People who are suffering from painful and traumatic medical issues deserve support in various forms.\n\nBecoming a party to their lies and deceit that have the potential to ruin a person's life is not one of those ways.\n\nThe people who are saying YTA because your sister is sick and this is none of your business are incorrect. You are there supporting her and she is completely free to continue to accept your support even though you exposed her lies.

Truth hurts.", "NTA \n\nYour sister is a real piece of work and, in letting her continue her charade, she would have cause more damage.", "NTA. You exposed a con artist. You saved him a lot of misery. We need more people like you in the world.", "NTA, you clearly gave this guy an out from a toxic situation. That being said, it was a bad idea to talk about this right next to your sister if you intended on maintaining a relationship with her. The appropriate thing to do if you sensed something was off was \u201chey do you want to grab a coffee downstairs really quick while she\u2019s sleeping\u201d? And then talked with him out of earshot.", "NTA\nYou saved him", "YTA. The whole \u201cshe trapped him with pregnancy\u201d thing, I call BS on that. And ectopic pregnancies can be deadly. Dealing with one is an emergency. Organs surrounding the fallopian tubes can be permanently damaged, and a woman is at risk of bleeding to death. It\u2019s a big deal, big enough that your sister may never have children going forward. What she needs at this time is support from her family, and the man who fathered her child, irrelevant of whether or not the relationship continues past this emergency. He DOES bear some responsibility for this pregnancy. It ain\u2019t all on your sister. The way you speak of your sister is very judgemental throughout your entire post.", "*I also knew She's purposefully got pregnant thinking that she could get him to stay.*\n\nINFO: How do you know this? Are you speculating or is this something she told you? How much of this is something you heard or witnessed and how much have you heard from third parties, which could be a game of whispers.", "[removed]", "YTA. My god, your sister's in a hospital bed after suffering thru an ectopic pregnancy and loss, and you need to tell her bf ANYTHING? You never heard of minding your own business and letting the couple figure their own sh-t out? Naw instead you outted yourself as backbiting and toxic. She needs to get herself together -- but so do you. Good luck with that.", "YTA.", "NTA", " NTA ~~YT A~~ \n\n(Edit of verdict)  \nWhy did you go to see your sister when you seem to not have empathy for her loss or feel any supportive emotion?    \n\nShe just had a serious medical event with horrible implications for the future - can she have children now? - and you are pretending to her ex that  you will be supportive when you think her of her the way you describe.   \n\nThe way you speak of her is chilling. Low? irresponsible?  An ectopic pregnancy is not a moral punishment. \n\n Of course she cannot  stay with  this man but  his being there when she in hospital  for the crisis of losing his baby is something she may have needed .  Her family seem not have supportive feelings  for her.\n \nYour  sister should  have explained her family  disapprove of her and are not supportive, rather than pretend you wont take her in. But frankly she in hospital  with a horrible medical problem and maybe  feeling desperate for some support.", "Yeah I should've done that. But after last night I don't think I want a relationship with her. I've consistency came to her recuse. I'm always there to listen and give her advice. But it was the last straw. She even called me this morning just to blame me for everything and never took responsibility. I didn't say anything that wasn't true and after years of this cycle where she only uses us when she needs us and treats us like crap after she gets what she wants I snapped. I couldn't keep my mouth shut anymore. My parents hate the guys from what she told him and we hated him for what she told us and it was all lies to make herself be a victim.  It's not fair to me.", "Actually she did. I couldn't add it to the post above but months before she and him would call me because they would have fights on how he didn't want kids and she kept pressuring him to. I told her that both need to agree to have kids. And she ignored that because she thought a baby would fix everything. She specifically told me he would be a good dad and would never want his child to grow up without a father.  And I kept telling her he's warning you he doesn't. And then she told him that she's infertile. After going to get a pap smear. He's just as reckless because he should've used protection but like I told them he can easily walk away and pay child support which isn't much but she's the one that would have the child and raise it with our support.", "And it is NONE of your business whether or how this relationship continues. Let them work their own sh*t out.", "She's done this before. She has baby fever. And last time I spoke her before she got pregnant. He told me she keeps pressuring him to start a family but he said their relationship had become toxic and he didn't want to bring a baby into that. She kept pushing. And the told me herself that if she got pregnant he'd never leave the baby without a father. And I told her why would you want a baby if he clearly doesn't want one it. And I advised her that a baby will never fix her relationship. And then she gets pregnant. Lies to us that he's so happy. And then they break up and she comes to me that he was never happy with the pregnancy. I told her well what did you expect he told you and you decided to get pregnant anyways. And she said something along the lines that she didn't think of it ending this way.", "For context: this isn't the first time she's called only when she needs us. After years of trying to help her she does the same things. And we involved ourselves in her relationship because she's the one that comes to us. She only ever talks to us when she needs something from us. As soon as she turned 18 she left to state to live with a man she barely knew online only to come back home and leave again after they reconciled. Like I told her before. My relationship isn't perfect but it's functional and no relationship is perfect anyways. But at least I keep my things private and never involve anyone. I figure it out on my own. In the past couple of years she's been coming to me endlessly with every failed relationship talking about how horrible her partners are just to go back to them. I'll admit I had a very tough week and learned about some helath problems I had and I lost it. I went there with good intentions but ever since I arrived she was rude to me and treated me like crap. And when she fell asleep. Her bf looked like he didn't even want to be there and after everything she told me I had my reservations about him just to find out she pinned us against each other. And again it's the cycle where we all have to come to her rescue just for her to do the same things over again.", "Yep.", "Did you basically just say it's his fault for being manipulated and staying around regardless lmao", "It's okay to cut toxic people out of your life.", "There's a saying on this sub that sounds appropriate for you.\n\nDon't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.\n\nStop helping your sister/parents.

There may be a great reason why the sister wants little to do with this toxic family.", "I did have her back. But you can only help someone for so long. And unfortunately my parent hate this guy because of everything she's told them. She never mentioned how she threw bleach on his face or shot blanks at his car when he was leaving. I did apologize for the wrong timing but a person can only handle so much and see someone they love consistently not help themselves before we snap. Like I mentioned every time it's lie after lie and I don't involve myself in it. She involves me and then my parents do because they want me to be her support. And mentally as an eldest daughter it's always on my shoulders to fix everyone's issues and be the mediator and I help the best that I can but like I told my father yesterday. I'm done helping. I don't want to hear anyone's issues. I no longer want to be a support system for anymore or be responsible for anyone my myself. I had every good intentions in being there all I ever did was be by her side and let her make her choices but also tried to guide her so she can have stability. I've been everyone's punching bag when they needed help but no one has ever been there for me. And I never held that against them because I was always the strong one and always suffered in silence.

I've been through this with her for years. Trying to have her mature and see reason and do something with her life instead of jumping from relationship to relationship and moving in with each guy. If she wants to live her life she's welcome to but not at the expense of me or my parents because when she goes through a break up my parents are there to support her financially I'm I'm here emotionally and she has even stayed for months in my house rent free. I did this all with the illusion that she would change. The ex right now is genuinely a good guy who reach his limit with her. I'm a fair enough person to see that even if my parents hate him because of everything she said about him. She's told him alot of things about us and it was a lie. So no longer doing this with her.

If my sister didn't want me in her life I would respect that. But throughout the years she has come to me with every single issue and it's always the same thing new boyfriend new breakups. Every issue she has she puts me into it. I have always had her back and try to guide her because I'm not the one that's gonna cuddle her and not tell her what she is doing is wrong. I have had endless conversations to her that a baby does not change your relationship this isn't the 1st time she was pregnant this isn't the 1st time she's had a miscarriage this isn't the 1st time she's had an abortion. She's kept going on and on about how she's inferno and doesn't need to be on birth control and every boyfriend she's had never wanted to have a baby with her but she thought that if she wanted the baby they had no choice that they had to be there.

Ectopic pregnancies are *extremely* rare and they are typically one-off events.

She had every right to let him know the truth about her sister and how she\u2019s manipulating him among other things. If her sister is angry now that he knows the truth than so be it, that guy doesn\u2019t deserve to be treated that way when he deserves better.

Hoping the dude also cuts her out of his life.", "What am I making up? OP then said in a different comment that the sister kept pressuring the boyfriend to start a family, but the boyfriend said no because relationship was too toxic. The sister kept pushing though and eventually got pregnant. OP is contradicting herself. Why would the bf think the sister is infertile if she is pushing him to have a baby?", "bro I literally copied and pasted what OP said and you ignored it lmao  \nshe never said 2 ectopic. she opened the story saying her sister just had one (the one with the man that this story focuses on, hence the hospital setting) and then goes on to mention she found out her sister lied and said it was her first failed pregnancy, implying it's not  \n\n\nand before you go \"well first one was also ectopic so she had no way of thinking it would happen twice\", it doesn't fucking matter. if you lost ONE child and you go to have a second with someone else, you fucking tell them about your past (you're having a kid with them, i assume you trust them enough to open up to them) so they know that while rare and low risk, it HAS happened before to you and prepare them for what could happen. sister did nothing, lied to the man and used it to manipulate him even further  \n\n\n  \nalso politeness is relative", "> Why would the bf think the sister is infertile if she is pushing him to have a baby?\n\nWhy are you questioning it? Maybe sister was pressuring him to want to adopt or something. Who the fuck knows. But you insist on somehow placing blame on the guy who was \nmanipulated and lied to. And once again: **he was sexually assaulted. Stop fucking searching for ways to make it his fault.** You're disgusting."]}
