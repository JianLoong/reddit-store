It's unfortunate that the truth is your sister less and manipulates people to get what she wants, but it's the truth nonetheless.\n\nYour sister will never see it that way though.  All she's going to see is that you ruined her chances with him.  She's going to stay blind to the fact that it's her lies that made this blow up in her face.

To her you will still be TA, even when everything else says otherwise.", "ESH - sister because use pregnancy to keep man, kid is not a toy, you because exposing your sister medical history without permission, and yes bf is AH too because he is adult  and if he didn't want to have baby with someone then he shouldn't have unprotected s**, he could have used protection!", "Nta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sister was given a chance to come clean to this ex previously.  Keeping the original comment below but wanted to change the vote\n\n\nESH.  You should have confronted your sister about it first to give her a chance to come clean.  This was also not the time to share that information.  She just got out of a surgery for an ectopic pregnancy and your main concern is whether her boyfriend is there out of guilt?  How is that not shitty?\n\nYour sister is obviously an AH for the lying.  She does sound exhausting but she should have been given an opportunity to come clean.", "ESH - I wouldn\u2019t be getting involved in this mess, yeah she\u2019s a manipulator but he\u2019s hanging around which seems odd given what he knows and you\u2019re less interested in being there to be caring but seemingly just to be a part of what\u2019s going on. Not great", "You think I should apologize to her then? I feel guilty that he official left her, but at the same time I couldn't sit and not tell him the truth. The only reason he stood by her is because she was using his guilt and manipulating him.", "Not sure if I do. She only ever calls us when she needs something or wants something. Before this she would never call me back when I wanted to see how she was doing or answer my texts. But whenever she needed something from me I'm always there to help. I'm going through my own health problems but unlike her and my parents I don't have anyone to fall back on or anyone to be a good support for me. So I just deal with it with my husband on my side.", "She's says she's in therapy. She told her ex that she was in therapy and working on herself which is another reason he was giving her chance so I suspect she only got into therapy to please him. \n\nShe's been to therapy before and always gives up after a shirt time worth of sessions. Even though I told her therapy is a journey that can last years. It took me 2 years of therapy to be in a better place. It's not a 2 week journey and giving up after.", "Yeah, I can admit I was wrong on that part. The only reason why I told him she was pregnant before with another man is because she told him this was her first pregnancy in order to guilt him. Loosing your first pregnancy is tough on anyone. And she did lie to him that she was infertile. And that her Dr. Told her she's infertile. She refused to go on birth control too. That's why she's had multiple miscarriages and abortions. I was wrong but as a mom having a son I don't thinking I could have put up with those lies. I never want a girl to do this to my son. Do you think I should apologize to her?", "I actually spoke to her about this before. The issue is that she didn't just manipulate him but also my parents. My parents think it's all his fault. And her ex thought it was all our fault. She pinned up against each other and I realized that when he and I spoke.", "He left her yesterday after I left. I was there because she called me to be there and my parents are out of town. I work for 14 hours straight and spoke to the Dr and they said she was going to be discharged. I went there to not just be there but also take her home with me so I can care for her until my parents found the first flight back home. From the mintue I got there and told her I'll take her home with me she was very rude and said she didn't want to go with me. Even though I live closer to the hospital and can care for her in her recovery. And I felt annoyed because from the start she was dismissive and rude. I went with good intentions. We thought she was sleeping when we had the conversation.", "Well, you could apologize for discussing her medical history, but the rest of it isn't wrong, and it sounds like it'd just open a can of worms because she would draw no distinction. She absolutely treated her boyfriend badly, and it's his choice to leave her. I doubt he left her over the medical disclosures; she was manipulating him into staying with her, probably in a wide variety of ways.\n\nSo, although medical information shouldn't be disclosed, you should not take responsibility for her boyfriend leaving her.\n\nIt sounds reasonable for you to limit contact with her, as she seems to emotionally manipulate you too.", "What would you even apologize for?  You seem pretty pleased about what you did.", "I don't think you were wrong to disclose her previous pregnancies. She lied about her infertility, almost certainly with the intent to \"trap\" her BF. You were sharing what directly impacts him. \n\nThe only reason to apologize here is to make yourself feel better. I don't think it will matter one way or the other to your sister; she seems to only value others for what they can give to her, and your apology doesn't affect that.", "Well that changes everything.  I\u2019m sorry your sister sucks so much", "No I'm not necessarily pleased with the outcome. I don't regret telling him the truth but I regret that it's my fault he left her. I'm feeling guilty because maybe it wasn't the right time to expose her. I was just very upset at reliazing what my sister was doing. I'm a boy mom for for that moment the mom part of me took over than being a sister. If I was a sister I couldn't just shut up and spoke to her in privately and hoped she would do the right thing. But I felt so bad for the guy.... I don't know I'm confused and tired.", "Info are you in her dr appointments with her? Where did you get her medical info? Was she fake sleeping or dozing? \nYour posts all reak of idk... do you have other issues with your sister?", "Her therapist visits no. I always keep updated and usually she tells me she's stopped going or ect. And her abortions o know because two times she was pregnant I was the one there. And she was fake sleeping. She was wide awake when she yelled at me. And I have alot of issues with my sister. She only calls us when she needs something but could go months without answering our calls to see if she's okay. And she always has issues with her bfs and then comes to us for a few days. We advise her and then she goes back to the same thing ignoring us until she needs us. My issue is that she hates people getting in her business but involves us herself but telling things and asking for help."]}
