Sister was given a chance to come clean to this ex previously.  Keeping the original comment below but wanted to change the vote\n\n\nESH.  You should have confronted your sister about it first to give her a chance to come clean.  This was also not the time to share that information.  She just got out of a surgery for an ectopic pregnancy and your main concern is whether her boyfriend is there out of guilt?  How is that not shitty?\n\nYour sister is obviously an AH for the lying.  She does sound exhausting but she should have been given an opportunity to come clean.", "ESH - I wouldn\u2019t be getting involved in this mess, yeah she\u2019s a manipulator but he\u2019s hanging around which seems odd given what he knows and you\u2019re less interested in being there to be caring but seemingly just to be a part of what\u2019s going on. Not great", "You think I should apologize to her then? I feel guilty that he official left her, but at the same time I couldn't sit and not tell him the truth. The only reason he stood by her is because she was using his guilt and manipulating him.", "Not sure if I do. She only ever calls us when she needs something or wants something. Before this she would never call me back when I wanted to see how she was doing or answer my texts. But whenever she needed something from me I'm always there to help. I'm going through my own health problems but unlike her and my parents I don't have anyone to fall back on or anyone to be a good support for me. So I just deal with it with my husband on my side.", "She's says she's in therapy. She told her ex that she was in therapy and working on herself which is another reason he was giving her chance so I suspect she only got into therapy to please him. \n\nShe's been to therapy before and always gives up after a shirt time worth of sessions. Even though I told her therapy is a journey that can last years. It took me 2 years of therapy to be in a better place. It's not a 2 week journey and giving up after.", "Yeah, I can admit I was wrong on that part. The only reason why I told him she was pregnant before with another man is because she told him this was her first pregnancy in order to guilt him. Loosing your first pregnancy is tough on anyone. And she did lie to him that she was infertile. And that her Dr. Told her she's infertile. She refused to go on birth control too. That's why she's had multiple miscarriages and abortions. I was wrong but as a mom having a son I don't thinking I could have put up with those lies. I never want a girl to do this to my son. Do you think I should apologize to her?", "I actually spoke to her about this before. The issue is that she didn't just manipulate him but also my parents. My parents think it's all his fault. And her ex thought it was all our fault. She pinned up against each other and I realized that when he and I spoke.", "He left her yesterday after I left. I was there because she called me to be there and my parents are out of town. I work for 14 hours straight and spoke to the Dr and they said she was going to be discharged. I went there to not just be there but also take her home with me so I can care for her until my parents found the first flight back home. From the mintue I got there and told her I'll take her home with me she was very rude and said she didn't want to go with me. Even though I live closer to the hospital and can care for her in her recovery. And I felt annoyed because from the start she was dismissive and rude. I went with good intentions. We thought she was sleeping when we had the conversation.", "Well, you could apologize for discussing her medical history, but the rest of it isn't wrong, and it sounds like it'd just open a can of worms because she would draw no distinction. She absolutely treated her boyfriend badly, and it's his choice to leave her. I doubt he left her over the medical disclosures; she was manipulating him into staying with her, probably in a wide variety of ways.\n\nSo, although medical information shouldn't be disclosed, you should not take responsibility for her boyfriend leaving her.\n\nIt sounds reasonable for you to limit contact with her, as she seems to emotionally manipulate you too.", "What would you even apologize for?  You seem pretty pleased about what you did.", "I don't think you were wrong to disclose her previous pregnancies. She lied about her infertility, almost certainly with the intent to \"trap\" her BF. You were sharing what directly impacts him. \n\nThe only reason to apologize here is to make yourself feel better. I don't think it will matter one way or the other to your sister; she seems to only value others for what they can give to her, and your apology doesn't affect that.", "Well that changes everything.  I\u2019m sorry your sister sucks so much", "No I'm not necessarily pleased with the outcome. I don't regret telling him the truth but I regret that it's my fault he left her. I'm feeling guilty because maybe it wasn't the right time to expose her. I was just very upset at reliazing what my sister was doing. I'm a boy mom for for that moment the mom part of me took over than being a sister. If I was a sister I couldn't just shut up and spoke to her in privately and hoped she would do the right thing. But I felt so bad for the guy.... I don't know I'm confused and tired.", "Info are you in her dr appointments with her? Where did you get her medical info? Was she fake sleeping or dozing? \nYour posts all reak of idk... do you have other issues with your sister?", "Her therapist visits no. I always keep updated and usually she tells me she's stopped going or ect. And her abortions o know because two times she was pregnant I was the one there. And she was fake sleeping. She was wide awake when she yelled at me. And I have alot of issues with my sister. She only calls us when she needs something but could go months without answering our calls to see if she's okay. And she always has issues with her bfs and then comes to us for a few days. We advise her and then she goes back to the same thing ignoring us until she needs us. My issue is that she hates people getting in her business but involves us herself but telling things and asking for help.", "NTA. People who are suffering from painful and traumatic medical issues deserve support in various forms.\n\nBecoming a party to their lies and deceit that have the potential to ruin a person's life is not one of those ways.\n\nThe people who are saying YTA because your sister is sick and this is none of your business are incorrect. You are there supporting her and she is completely free to continue to accept your support even though you exposed her lies. If she decides that your honesty is a reason to decline your support that is on her, not you.", "Oh NTA, wow a manipulative person who fakes her sleeping wtf you did well to open the eyes of her ex. Truth hurts.", "NTA \n\nYour sister is a real piece of work and, in letting her continue her charade, she would have cause more damage.", "NTA. You exposed a con artist. You saved him a lot of misery. We need more people like you in the world.", "NTA, you clearly gave this guy an out from a toxic situation. That being said, it was a bad idea to talk about this right next to your sister if you intended on maintaining a relationship with her. The appropriate thing to do if you sensed something was off was \u201chey do you want to grab a coffee downstairs really quick while she\u2019s sleeping\u201d? And then talked with him out of earshot.", "NTA\nYou saved him", "YTA. The whole \u201cshe trapped him with pregnancy\u201d thing, I call BS on that. And ectopic pregnancies can be deadly. Dealing with one is an emergency. Organs surrounding the fallopian tubes can be permanently damaged, and a woman is at risk of bleeding to death. It\u2019s a big deal, big enough that your sister may never have children going forward. What she needs at this time is support from her family, and the man who fathered her child, irrelevant of whether or not the relationship continues past this emergency. He DOES bear some responsibility for this pregnancy. It ain\u2019t all on your sister. The way you speak of your sister is very judgemental throughout your entire post.", "*I also knew She's purposefully got pregnant thinking that she could get him to stay.*\n\nINFO: How do you know this? Are you speculating or is this something she told you? How much of this is something you heard or witnessed and how much have you heard from third parties, which could be a game of whispers.", "[removed]", "YTA. My god, your sister's in a hospital bed after suffering thru an ectopic pregnancy and loss, and you need to tell her bf ANYTHING? You never heard of minding your own business and letting the couple figure their own sh-t out? Naw instead you outted yourself as backbiting and toxic. She needs to get herself together -- but so do you. Good luck with that.", "YTA.", "NTA", "YTA \nWhat you did shows you can go very low indeed. \n\nWhy did you go to see your sister when you clearly  wish her harm? \n\n\nShe just had a serious medical event with horrible implications for the future - can she have children now? - and you are pretending to her ex that her family will be there for her.\n\nFrankly you  lied when said your family would be there-  they are not safe for her because  of how you wish her ill-        \n\n  maybe your family wouldn't refuse to take her as they would look bad   you are so low you used her very big emergency as an opportunity  to be abusive  about  her. \nThe way you speak of her is chilling. \n\nHopefully next time you sister will not be diplomatic and will explain her family  dislike her and are cruel to her and hopefully leave intinctions to staff  to not allow you near her,.", "Yeah I should've done that. But after last night I don't think I want a relationship with her. I've consistency came to her recuse. I'm always there to listen and give her advice. But it was the last straw. She even called me this morning just to blame me for everything and never took responsibility. I didn't say anything that wasn't true and after years of this cycle where she only uses us when she needs us and treats us like crap after she gets what she wants I snapped. I couldn't keep my mouth shut anymore. My parents hate the guys from what she told him and we hated him for what she told us and it was all lies to make herself be a victim.  It's not fair to me.", "Actually she did. I couldn't add it to the post above but months before she and him would call me because they would have fights on how he didn't want kids and she kept pressuring him to. I told her that both need to agree to have kids. And she ignored that because she thought a baby would fix everything. She specifically told me he would be a good dad and would never want his child to grow up without a father.  And I kept telling her he's warning you he doesn't. And then she told him that she's infertile. After going to get a pap smear. He's just as reckless because he should've used protection but like I told them he can easily walk away and pay child support which isn't much but she's the one that would have the child and raise it with our support.", "And it is NONE of your business whether or how this relationship continues. Let them work their own sh*t out.", "She's done this before. She has baby fever. And last time I spoke her before she got pregnant. He told me she keeps pressuring him to start a family but he said their relationship had become toxic and he didn't want to bring a baby into that. She kept pushing. And the told me herself that if she got pregnant he'd never leave the baby without a father. And I told her why would you want a baby if he clearly doesn't want one it. And I advised her that a baby will never fix her relationship. And then she gets pregnant. Lies to us that he's so happy. And then they break up and she comes to me that he was never happy with the pregnancy. I told her well what did you expect he told you and you decided to get pregnant anyways. And she said something along the lines that she didn't think of it ending this way.", "For context: this isn't the first time she's called only when she needs us. After years of trying to help her she does the same things. And we involved ourselves in her relationship because she's the one that comes to us. She only ever talks to us when she needs something from us. As soon as she turned 18 she left to state to live with a man she barely knew online only to come back home and leave again after they reconciled. Like I told her before. My relationship isn't perfect but it's functional and no relationship is perfect anyways. But at least I keep my things private and never involve anyone. I figure it out on my own. In the past couple of years she's been coming to me endlessly with every failed relationship talking about how horrible her partners are just to go back to them. I'll admit I had a very tough week and learned about some helath problems I had and I lost it. I went there with good intentions but ever since I arrived she was rude to me and treated me like crap. And when she fell asleep. Her bf looked like he didn't even want to be there and after everything she told me I had my reservations about him just to find out she pinned us against each other. And again it's the cycle where we all have to come to her rescue just for her to do the same things over again.", "Yep.", "Did you basically just say it's his fault for being manipulated and staying around regardless lmao", "It's okay to cut toxic people out of your life.", "There's a saying on this sub that sounds appropriate for you.\n\nDon't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.\n\nStop helping your sister/parents. Block her number and messages for a while. You need to save your energy and effort for your own problems because as you mentioned, you don't have anyone to rely on other than your husband.", "You are not a medical professional. You have no duty of confidentiality. She was using a medical lie to abuse someone. If you had told him with no prompting, it would have been uncalled for, but she disclosed her medical information first, and since she was using false information to hurt someone, the right thing to do was correct it to prevent the harm.\n\nNTA You protected someone and hurt no one. Stop feeling guilty about this.", "Like you said it is none of their business but I'm the first one she calls for advice and when she has a problem and I have never denied being there for her. Now I will because I understand just how much this isn't my business so next time she comes to me I'm just going to ignore her or drop the call because she involves me in it and on top of that my parents call me non stop to get involved because they think she listens to me. So I'm being called from all different places. Now I will have that boundaries where I just won't listen . It only brings me troubles.", "[removed]", "And OP is so judgemental. There may be a great reason why the sister wants little to do with this toxic family.", "I did have her back. But you can only help someone for so long. And unfortunately my parent hate this guy because of everything she's told them. She never mentioned how she threw bleach on his face or shot blanks at his car when he was leaving. I did apologize for the wrong timing but a person can only handle so much and see someone they love consistently not help themselves before we snap. Like I mentioned every time it's lie after lie and I don't involve myself in it. She involves me and then my parents do because they want me to be her support. And mentally as an eldest daughter it's always on my shoulders to fix everyone's issues and be the mediator and I help the best that I can but like I told my father yesterday. I'm done helping. I don't want to hear anyone's issues. I no longer want to be a support system for anymore or be responsible for anyone my myself. I had every good intentions in being there all I ever did was be by her side and let her make her choices but also tried to guide her so she can have stability. I've been everyone's punching bag when they needed help but no one has ever been there for me. And I never held that against them because I was always the strong one and always suffered in silence. I love her and I wish her the best life but I no longer want to be the shoulder she cries on.", "OP, please don't take this person's words to heart, they clearly are projecting something. \n\nYour sister sounds like a toxic nightmare, and telling the truth to somebody that has been misled like that does not make you TA at all. I'm sorry you (and everyone else involved) had to deal with these manipulations. At least now you've fully seen her for who she really is and can distance yourself from her moving forward.\n\nNTA"]}
