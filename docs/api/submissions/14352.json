Sister was given a chance to come clean to this ex previously.  Keeping the original comment below but wanted to change the vote\n\n\nESH.  You should have confronted your sister about it first to give her a chance to come clean.  This was also not the time to share that information.  She just got out of a surgery for an ectopic pregnancy and your main concern is whether her boyfriend is there out of guilt?  How is that not shitty?\n\nYour sister is obviously an AH for the lying.  She does sound exhausting but she should have been given an opportunity to come clean.", "ESH - I wouldn\u2019t be getting involved in this mess, yeah she\u2019s a manipulator but he\u2019s hanging around which seems odd given what he knows and you\u2019re less interested in being there to be caring but seemingly just to be a part of what\u2019s going on. Not great", "You think I should apologize to her then? I feel guilty that he official left her, but at the same time I couldn't sit and not tell him the truth. The only reason he stood by her is because she was using his guilt and manipulating him.", "Not sure if I do. She only ever calls us when she needs something or wants something. Before this she would never call me back when I wanted to see how she was doing or answer my texts. But whenever she needed something from me I'm always there to help. I'm going through my own health problems but unlike her and my parents I don't have anyone to fall back on or anyone to be a good support for me. So I just deal with it with my husband on my side.", "She's says she's in therapy. She told her ex that she was in therapy and working on herself which is another reason he was giving her chance so I suspect she only got into therapy to please him. \n\nShe's been to therapy before and always gives up after a shirt time worth of sessions. Even though I told her therapy is a journey that can last years. It took me 2 years of therapy to be in a better place. It's not a 2 week journey and giving up after.", "Yeah, I can admit I was wrong on that part. The only reason why I told him she was pregnant before with another man is because she told him this was her first pregnancy in order to guilt him. Loosing your first pregnancy is tough on anyone. And she did lie to him that she was infertile. And that her Dr. Told her she's infertile. She refused to go on birth control too. That's why she's had multiple miscarriages and abortions. I was wrong but as a mom having a son I don't thinking I could have put up with those lies. I never want a girl to do this to my son. Do you think I should apologize to her?", "I actually spoke to her about this before. The issue is that she didn't just manipulate him but also my parents. My parents think it's all his fault. And her ex thought it was all our fault. She pinned up against each other and I realized that when he and I spoke.", "He left her yesterday after I left. I was there because she called me to be there and my parents are out of town. I work for 14 hours straight and spoke to the Dr and they said she was going to be discharged. I went there to not just be there but also take her home with me so I can care for her until my parents found the first flight back home. From the mintue I got there and told her I'll take her home with me she was very rude and said she didn't want to go with me. Even though I live closer to the hospital and can care for her in her recovery. And I felt annoyed because from the start she was dismissive and rude. I went with good intentions. We thought she was sleeping when we had the conversation.", "Well, you could apologize for discussing her medical history, but the rest of it isn't wrong, and it sounds like it'd just open a can of worms because she would draw no distinction. She absolutely treated her boyfriend badly, and it's his choice to leave her. I doubt he left her over the medical disclosures; she was manipulating him into staying with her, probably in a wide variety of ways.\n\nSo, although medical information shouldn't be disclosed, you should not take responsibility for her boyfriend leaving her.\n\nIt sounds reasonable for you to limit contact with her, as she seems to emotionally manipulate you too.", "What would you even apologize for?  You seem pretty pleased about what you did.", "I don't think you were wrong to disclose her previous pregnancies. She lied about her infertility, almost certainly with the intent to \"trap\" her BF. You were sharing what directly impacts him. \n\nThe only reason to apologize here is to make yourself feel better. I don't think it will matter one way or the other to your sister; she seems to only value others for what they can give to her, and your apology doesn't affect that.", "Well that changes everything.  I\u2019m sorry your sister sucks so much", "No I'm not necessarily pleased with the outcome. I don't regret telling him the truth but I regret that it's my fault he left her. I'm feeling guilty because maybe it wasn't the right time to expose her. I was just very upset at reliazing what my sister was doing. I'm a boy mom for for that moment the mom part of me took over than being a sister. If I was a sister I couldn't just shut up and spoke to her in privately and hoped she would do the right thing. But I felt so bad for the guy.... I don't know I'm confused and tired.", "Info are you in her dr appointments with her? Where did you get her medical info? Was she fake sleeping or dozing? \nYour posts all reak of idk... do you have other issues with your sister?", "Her therapist visits no. I always keep updated and usually she tells me she's stopped going or ect. And her abortions o know because two times she was pregnant I was the one there. And she was fake sleeping. She was wide awake when she yelled at me. And I have alot of issues with my sister. She only calls us when she needs something but could go months without answering our calls to see if she's okay. And she always has issues with her bfs and then comes to us for a few days. We advise her and then she goes back to the same thing ignoring us until she needs us.

And then talked with him out of earshot.", "NTA\nYou saved him", "YTA. The whole \u201cshe trapped him with pregnancy\u201d thing, I call BS on that. And ectopic pregnancies can be deadly. Dealing with one is an emergency. Organs surrounding the fallopian tubes can be permanently damaged, and a woman is at risk of bleeding to death. It\u2019s a big deal, big enough that your sister may never have children going forward. What she needs at this time is support from her family, and the man who fathered her child, irrelevant of whether or not the relationship continues past this emergency. He DOES bear some responsibility for this pregnancy. It ain\u2019t all on your sister.

But after last night I don't think I want a relationship with her. I've consistency came to her recuse. I'm always there to listen and give her advice. But it was the last straw. She even called me this morning just to blame me for everything and never took responsibility. I didn't say anything that wasn't true and after years of this cycle where she only uses us when she needs us and treats us like crap after she gets what she wants I snapped. I couldn't keep my mouth shut anymore. My parents hate the guys from what she told him and we hated him for what she told us and it was all lies to make herself be a victim.  It's not fair to me.", "Actually she did. I couldn't add it to the post above but months before she and him would call me because they would have fights on how he didn't want kids and she kept pressuring him to. I told her that both need to agree to have kids. And she ignored that because she thought a baby would fix everything. She specifically told me he would be a good dad and would never want his child to grow up without a father.  And I kept telling her he's warning you he doesn't. And then she told him that she's infertile. After going to get a pap smear. He's just as reckless because he should've used protection but like I told them he can easily walk away and pay child support which isn't much but she's the one that would have the child and raise it with our support.", "And it is NONE of your business whether or how this relationship continues. Let them work their own sh*t out.", "She's done this before. She has baby fever. And last time I spoke her before she got pregnant. He told me she keeps pressuring him to start a family but he said their relationship had become toxic and he didn't want to bring a baby into that. She kept pushing. And the told me herself that if she got pregnant he'd never leave the baby without a father. And I told her why would you want a baby if he clearly doesn't want one it. And I advised her that a baby will never fix her relationship. And then she gets pregnant. Lies to us that he's so happy. And then they break up and she comes to me that he was never happy with the pregnancy. I told her well what did you expect he told you and you decided to get pregnant anyways. And she said something along the lines that she didn't think of it ending this way.", "For context: this isn't the first time she's called only when she needs us. After years of trying to help her she does the same things. And we involved ourselves in her relationship because she's the one that comes to us. She only ever talks to us when she needs something from us. As soon as she turned 18 she left to state to live with a man she barely knew online only to come back home and leave again after they reconciled. Like I told her before. My relationship isn't perfect but it's functional and no relationship is perfect anyways. But at least I keep my things private and never involve anyone. I figure it out on my own. In the past couple of years she's been coming to me endlessly with every failed relationship talking about how horrible her partners are just to go back to them. I'll admit I had a very tough week and learned about some helath problems I had and I lost it. I went there with good intentions but ever since I arrived she was rude to me and treated me like crap. And when she fell asleep. Her bf looked like he didn't even want to be there and after everything she told me I had my reservations about him just to find out she pinned us against each other.

If she wants to live her life she's welcome to but not at the expense of me or my parents because when she goes through a break up my parents are there to support her financially I'm I'm here emotionally and she has even stayed for months in my house rent free. I did this all with the illusion that she would change. The ex right now is genuinely a good guy who reach his limit with her.

If my sister didn't want me in her life I would respect that. But throughout the years she has come to me with every single issue and it's always the same thing new boyfriend new breakups. Every issue she has she puts me into it. I have always had her back and try to guide her because I'm not the one that's gonna cuddle her and not tell her what she is doing is wrong. I have had endless conversations to her that a baby does not change your relationship this isn't the 1st time she was pregnant this isn't the 1st time she's had a miscarriage this isn't the 1st time she's had an abortion. She's kept going on and on about how she's inferno and doesn't need to be on birth control and every boyfriend she's had never wanted to have a baby with her but she thought that if she wanted the baby they had no choice that they had to be there. I went to the hospital with very good intentions to be next to her and the moment I got into that room she was aggressive and rude and I even took her to the bathroom to help her because he didn't.

If allowed to develop, the fetus will burst through the Fallopian tube or other internal organs because it\u2019s growing in the wrong spot.

In her opinion she's infertile because she had tried to get pregnant multiple time and was never successful not because a Dr told her. Then she said she was definitely infertile because of all the miscarriages. Then she had abortions. And ect. The baby thing I spoke to her about it countless times because he made it clear to not just her but to me he doesn't want children with her. So I explained to her mutiw times that having a child with someone who clearly doesn't want it is wrong. She made him believe she was infertile and this was some kind of miracle baby. He didn't know she was pregnant before and previous were miscarriages and abortions. She guilty him by telling him that it was her first and only child and disappointed how she lost it and I understand that. She was really sad about it but during this process she was considering abortion because he wasn't happy about the child but felt obligated to stay and it was everything she wanted when she spoke to me. So when we talked in the hospital the convo was light. But then he opened up and made her out to be this victim and told me about things she said about us and I lost it. Not only was she treating me like crap for coming to the hospital to visit her and help her but she was lying. She called me saying she wanted me there before her surgery then her ex showed and she started being mean and rude to me.

I really thought he deserved to know because obviously he doesn't want to be with her.
