Say in front of a judge that you are mad that your ex is a better parent and person, and you want to \u201cpunish\u201d her by giving away MORE time with your kids, so they have more proof that their mother is the better parent. \nI can not WAIT for your follow up post in a few years, where you complain that your kids never want to visit you and your next wife, and how it is clearly your ex-wife poisoning them, and not the fact that you willingly dumped more responsibility on their mother so you could attempt to get your weenie wet.

You had kids you need to own up to that and take care of them. You are jealous your wife has a partner and got laid. I know everyone has needs but you sound like getting laid should be above your kids. What do you do during the week after work? Can you not get a babysitter to watch the kids while you go on a date?

Your ex already has the more than you and you want to ask her to have even less free time than she already has cause your not getting laid.

Your reasons are utterly selfish. At least if you moved back, you could do a 50/50 split and be responsible for school drop-off, etc. half the time.  Maybe your ex would be happy with this as well. Weektime childcare is not as rosy as it seems, one barely sees one kid during the week with school and extracurricular. Going every other weekend is 4 days a month. That is stucky dad material! You are a 'poor me', could this be the reason you have no girlfriend?", "YTA rather than give up the precious little time you do get with your kids permanently, why don\u2019t you just hire a babysitter once in a while?", "If you wanted weekends off you shouldn't have moved away. Pain and simple.\n\nIf you want to have every other weekend off then move into their school district and help out during the week. \n\nEvery other weekend is completely outdated and ridiculous and dad's are held to a higher standard these days as they should be. YTA.", "YTA. I do actually get wanting weekends off childcare but the trade for that is weeks on, and you're the one who moved too far from their schools for that. Meanwhile their mum does all the school stuff and doesn't get the fun time with them. Move back closer and share both.", "YTA. You can go out during the weekend too, ya know?", "YTA. This is embarrassing for you OP.", "You're awful. YTA.", "YTA. You have significantly more kid free days than your Ex. No one is stopping you from dating during the week.", "YTA. You decided to move too far away and you decided to only have the kids on the weekends because of that. You still have five days a week to do whatever you want when you\u2019re off work. You may no longer be married, but you\u2019re still a parent. And right now you get to be the fun parent while your ex has to do all of the school stuff, doctor appointments, all the responsible stuff. You have the much lighter burden here. Really it just sounds like you\u2019re trying to do this out of jealousy in addition to wanting to shirk your responsibilities as a parent. You can find a new romantic interest during the week. All you have to do is put in some effort.", "YTA. Move back and go 50/50, figure out how to have a social life during the week, or hire a sitter for afrer bedtime on the weekends. Don't worry too much- eventually your kids will catch on to your attitude and ask to change the arrangement themselves so they can have sleepovers at friends house and their own socisl lives. Of course you'll probably be on here complaining about how their mother turned them against you when they happens....", "YTA. Do you work 24 hours a day? You get 5 days off a week from your kids and she gets 2.", "YTA.  My dad got me on the weekends too and it devastated him to see me so little (my parents lived too far apart for joint custody).  Guess what?  He was able to pick me up nearly every weekend for 12 years and still meet the woman he married.  The fact he was always there for me is something I'll hold in my heart forever.  Just don't expect to have a relationship with your kids.  Your ex is going to call you a bad dad because you're acting like one.  Then again, if you don't actually care much about your kids (which seems pretty on point), maybe they'd be better off seeing you less.  Again, don't be surprised or upset when the step-dad walks them down the aisle or starts being called \"dad\" because that's def a thing that's going to happen, too. I have so many other thoughts about this, but don't want to get a ban.", "YTA for the the reason you want to change the custody agreement. It\u2019s not for your kids, it because you want to get your little pecker wet.", "YTA. The mature solution to this problem is life changes that would allow you to alternate entire weeks. That way you get every other weekend and you are pulling your weight as a father. (Both of which aren't occuring now)", "YTA.  Please get to know Rosie Palm and her 5 sisters, and that might help your situation and relieve your frustration about not getting laid. \n\nNow your ex takes care of the kids all the time snd you want to be an AH and not see your kids as much, because they take up too much of your free time.  Figure out how to justify it.", "Yep, it's YTA. You have weekday evenings for dating. This is a phase, and after not too many years your kids won't want to come on weekends anyway because they'll have their own lives. The less you engage with them now the worse off your relationship will be with them for the long run.", "Yeahhh no one here is struggling to see why you\u2019re still single. YTA", "YTA. I love my kids, but I wish they'd go away.  You deserve whatever nursing home they leave you in 40 years from now.", "YTA\n\nAlmost thought my ex wrote this because this is our agreement as well\n\nYou have ALL week free to go out and do whatever you like, do you think it\u2019s easy for her to go to work all day, pick the kids up from school/daycare, feed, parent, get them in bed, get them up and ready to do it all again the next day?\n\nYOU chose to be a father, this is what that means. IF you want to change custody, better offer up some more child support then, also if you think your kids won\u2019t find out that \u201cDaddy gave up time with us so he could go out, meet someone, and get laid\u201d, do I have news for you\u2026\n\nIf you didn\u2019t want to be a dad, then you shouldn\u2019t have had kids. Put on your big boy pants and accept responsibility for your actions", "YTA what about she gets a full week (7 days) and you get a full week (7 days).", "Damn dude, YTA! Everyone will blast you because you\u2019re more worried about getting laid than parenting your kids. You have plenty of time during the week to do whatever you want; use that. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re jealous that your ex is managing everything and moving on. Full time mom and dad, working, friends, dating again. All you can manage is a a job and a few weekends and even that\u2019s too much for you. You wouldn\u2019t seem like a bad dad, you\u2019d be one. Check your priorities.", "Yuck- YTA. You\u2019re not gonna have an easier time finding a gf when you tell them why you don\u2019t see your kids on the weekend. Your dick is gonna stay drier than Ben Shapiro\u2019s wife\u2019s vagina.", "YTA. Take them for the weekdays so you get your weekends off then. Plenty of time to date. Win-win.", "I\u2019m not gonna judge but I bet if you asked your ex she\u2019d gladly take the kids on the weekends.  She probably misses out on doing the fun things with them since she only has them on weekdays where she has to work and help with homework and doesn\u2019t have time for things like going to the zoo etc.   I would hate never having my kids on weekends.", "You can not seriously be this stupid and mean. Are you thinking about your children at all???   \n Also hey maybe their mom deserves the weekends off since you moved far enough away you can't help during the week. \n\n Suck it the fuck up, you are a father first of all, you can worry about getting laid either later or do it during the week when you don't have your kids.", "YTA you get them 2 days a week! You know what you can do pay for a babysitter for a night out!", "lemme play you a song on the worlds tiniest violin \ud83c\udfbb ofc yta", "1) YWBTA. You're prioritizing a social life that you can have during the week over time with your kids.\n\n2) So what if you haven't gotten laid? Been 4 years here and I ain't bitching about it (divorce started this year) and I'm not looking forward to it ever happening again.\n\nPut your kids FIRST and your social life SECOND.", "For everyone saying he is the AH, his ex wife gets more \u201cfree time\u201d than he does.  She gets school hours and then weekends.  OP works and then has the kids at the weekend.  So basically no free time as I know how hard it is to wind down after work and prepare for work the next day.  If I was you OP I would take one weekend every couple of months if she doesn\u2019t like it say you are sick.  You deserve free time too. I\u2019m sure you would love to see your kids more during the week.", "Do you have the kids from Friday night or Saturday morning? I was in a similar situation a most women I was chatting with only had weekends free making dating a little difficult but week night dates are sometimes an option. Do you have some family who could have the kids on a Saturday night?", "WNBTA - I get where you\u2019re coming from. You should also get some free weekend time, its only fair. But also if thats the case you should find a way to take some weekdays also and alternate weekends with your ex. That way its fair for the both of you. Not sure how that will work since you said you live far but you also cant make her take them on the weekends if shes taking care of them all week. You need to find a fair compromise where the both of you can enjoy having free time.", "Nah most custody arrangements ive ever seen have the non custodial parent taking them every other weekend. Your ex didnt force this on you....you just didnt think it thru. There is nothing wrong with wanting to also be able to enjoy free time yourself tho. Parents are still people and you still have a right to find someone. Hopefully your ex will agree to every other weekend. Im honestly surprised you agreed to every weekend. Ive never seen that.", "[deleted]", "Nta you can propose a new agreement if is better for the two parts", "YTA because you made it about you and not your kids. There will come a time when thi ga get more complicates, sports, music, school etc so some communication is warranted. An arrangement that works for 2 kids and might be a compromise is:\n\nWeekend 1: Kid 1\n\nWeekend 2: Kid 2\n\nWeekend 3: Both\n\nWeekend 4: None\n\nBoth kids get individual time with both parents. Your time with them can be special, and they also get time together as well.", "A lot of comments on here that wouldn\u2019t be here if this wasn\u2019t a man\u2019s post\u2026\u2026\nYou wouldn\u2019t be the first to negotiate custody just to find that it wasn\u2019t like you expected.\nIf the kids are asleep 10 hours a day and in school for 8 with wrap around care and you pick them up on Friday then you get around the same amount of time with the kids each in reality although you ex gets a lot more of the actual care with regards homework, dressing them, putting them to bed etc\nThe best solution is to move close enough to their school that you can share custody but it would be worth talking with your ex.\nI personally would hate not having kids on any weekends, it would make me feel like a ducking maid!\nYou don\u2019t have to have them all of every weekend OR all of every other weekend. She might want to have the odd Saturday or Sunday with them? More importantly your kids might want that!", "NTA. You would have to talk to your ex and possibly take her back to court. Not having any downtime is a recipe for burnout which wouldn\u2019t be good for your kids.", "Why don\u2019t you modify custody so that you at least have dinner with them 1 x per week (go to them and take them out to eat) and then do extended every other weekend so that you pick them up every other Friday afternoon and take them to school that Monday morning.  Then you only drop one day and you pick up two dinners.  That will increase their weekday time with you and give them more frequent contact with you than just weekends.", "NTA to ask but based on what you are saying..you will see them less than 8 days a month.  You can't get them during the week so what your proposing is to see them less.  If it's feasible maybe you can move closer and then you can see them during the week and have a full weekend to yourself.", "NTA \nA lot of non custodial parents only get their kids every other weekend so I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re being vilified in the comments. Another alternative though would be to get them for all their school holidays (teacher workday etc) in lieu of the fewer weekends, hire a babysitter for one night a weekend or change the type of person you\u2019re trying to date e.g. a working parent who understands your limited availability. You\u2019re not wrong for wanting a day to yourself to socialize and find a partner. You\u2019re not even wrong for being jealous that\u2019s human nature. You will be wrong if you make it an issue with your ex without giving her an incentive. You\u2019re the one wanting the change so you have to come up with a plan that everyone can live with. Not just \u201cI only want them every other weekend\u201d.", "Agreed.", "He only sees his kids 8 days a month and wants to cut that down to 4 days? Can people not go on dates on week nights?\n\nYTA", "Ponders why OP is still single......", "This! Hire a sitter for a couple hours of you MUST go out on a weekend. But honestly god trying to get less time with your kids when you only see them 8 days a month? Learn how to manage your time and take someone out to dinner on a weeknight. That is possible. YTA", "Right like why can't you go on a date on a Thursday?", "And if the change is approved by the judge, maybe CS will be adjusted to more money = more time with mom.", "It\u2019s only odd and inconvenient because OP decided to move away from his kids, though! I live somewhere I despise because it\u2019s where my kid is.", "His reason for wanting to move to 4 days of parenting a month make him an AH.", "One evening a week and every other weekend is not a fair schedule. That would put more of the responsibility on OP\u2019s ex.", "So you think it\u2019s ok for a parent to only see their kids two weekends out of the month so he can get laid? Parenting is a 24/7 job. OP only does it two and half days out of the week. He has plenty of free time during the weeks while his ex is raising their two kids.", "What about all the free time OP gets during the week when his ex is raising the kids? As an adult, you have to take your free time where you find it.", "then OPs ex wife only gets 2 days a month \u201coff?\u201d", "You know hiring a babysitter is a possibility right?", "I feel like we\u2019re getting a hint of why he\u2019s divorced.", "Right? As if a deadbeat dad is a prize out here. If I heard a guy willingly asked for less time with his kids it would be such a turnoff", "This. I managed to date a guy where we had opposite weekend custody schedules. There\u2019s more going on here about why he can\u2019t get a date.", "A little but would also give the ex one night off a week and I wouldn't assume the ex enjoys *never* having the kids on a weekend.", "That\u2019s a good point. There\u2019s no way he has no free time during the week."]}
