Say in front of a judge that you are mad that your ex is a better parent and person, and you want to \u201cpunish\u201d her by giving away MORE time with your kids, so they have more proof that their mother is the better parent. \nI can not WAIT for your follow up post in a few years, where you complain that your kids never want to visit you and your next wife, and how it is clearly your ex-wife poisoning them, and not the fact that you willingly dumped more responsibility on their mother so you could attempt to get your weenie wet.

I agree with you that this is somewhat of an odd arrangement, and I get why it would be inconvenient on both ends. But your reasoning here is shit.

You had kids you need to own up to that and take care of them. You are jealous your wife has a partner and got laid. I know everyone has needs but you sound like getting laid should be above your kids. What do you do during the week after work? Can you not get a babysitter to watch the kids while you go on a date? Life gets hard with kids, and finding a way to juggle is part of being an adult. Your solution is to drop part of the responsibilities of being a father, that is not okay.", "YTA. Your ex already has the more than you and you want to ask her to have even less free time than she already has cause your not getting laid.

Maybe it's a good thing you haven't been able to get laid again, cuz you know.....you can get MORE kids that'll take up more of your free time.", "Jesus, dude.\n\nYTA.", "Move closer to their school.  That is your obligation so that you can participate in their lives.\n\nThen, you can 50/50.  Until then, do not ask for less time under any circumstance unless you want to be considered an asshole by all.\n\nBelieve it or not, there are lots of people who work on the weekends and have their days off during the week.  Takes more effort to find them, but if you really wanted to, you could.\n\nYTA", "You sound like my kid's dad. YTA. \n\nSay you got a new job that's long hours and calls for nights and weekends. Then say (to save face and look like a good dad) you begged and pleaded to at LEAST have every other weekend off. Your ex will either see you for what you are or if you're lucky she'll believe you and think you're a good dad for making such sacrifices for the kids. \n\nBut seriously. Asking to have less time with them can ultimately lead to no time with them. Kids notice and pay attention. Mine's 4 and realizes just how little her dad interacts with her. You know what else small children are known for? Definitely not their filter. Don't be surprised if they tell everyone how little they see you. \n\nHave you even thought this through or are you only capable of seeing two minutes into the future?!", "Why did you move too far away from your own kids?\n\nSolve the problem. Move closer. Take on more responsibility during the difficult school week, then you can discuss alternate weekends allowing your selfish ass to get a shag or two and your ex wife to have a bloody break during the week. \n\n\nYTA", "YTA i wonder why you are divorced and you are still single", "Agreed! \n\nYTA OP! And your really, really are. You want \u201cfree\u201d time?? You only see the kids on weekends. Your ex has them the rest of the time. If you want to \u201cget laid\u201d do it on the weekdays! Grow up. Not hard to see why she\u2019s your ex, you are only thinking about yourself and not even cherishing the little time you have with your children and for what???? Because you want to get laid. Wow.", "Bingo!", "Agreed. And to add on a point about caring for them when sick that people miss, kids get sick a lot, which means that parent has to regularly leave work to pick up a sick child. That affects their job performance, their ability to do overtime and earn promotions, unless a company is very flexible that parent has their career take a dent for that responsibility.", "Agreed.

That affects their job performance, their ability to do overtime and earn promotions, unless a company is very flexible that parent has their career take a dent for that responsibility.", "You read my mind lol", "Also that he has less money to date because his child support will probably increase.", "This is good advice. Being a single parent makes it difficult to date. You are very lonely yet if you take time away from your kids you feel extremely guilty. No matter how much time you\u2019ve spent with them. I think OP was just expressing his frustration with the situation. Throwing in the \u201cgetting laid\u201d part makes him sound like a major AH but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not just that part of it but the loneliness that\u2019s bothering him. I don\u2019t think cutting 8 days down to less is the answer so he does need to move back closer so he can have some weekdays as well. This arrangement is tough on both parents. As others have mentioned she only gets time when the kids have school and he doesn\u2019t have any time for himself when he doesn\u2019t have to work.", "Right! The majority of my dates were on week nights.", "What! *He\u2019d have to pay for that*, gasp!", "This guy couldn't handle being married with kids, and now can't even handle 5 days completely solo and only weekends with kids.\n\nHow selfish can you be", "And I bet he will cry about how mom is living the high life off of his child support, while his child support is something laughable like $500 a month. Like, yeah, living the high life on what is a little less than one week of daycare.", "INFO: Did OP make the decision, or was it where he could afford to move when he moved out of the family home?", "Hell id say more than a hint", "I used to work weekends and nights (restaurants), somehow I\u2019m not single too.", "That's why so many guys pretend it's the exes who are keeping them from the the kids and the system is biased against them.", "Absolutely!! But isn't that what child support is for? Living the high life -- going out all the time, traveling when you want, buying fancy cars...\n\nOh, wait, if you have the kids full time, you don't have the time for all of that!", "Hed still be an asshole if he did that considering he has them 8/30 & 8/31 days of the month. He has all week to do date nights. If I was going on a date with OP and I heard how he got a babysitter for kids he only sees 8 days out of the month I\u2019d leave.", "I think that could depend. If OP stepped up and made a lot of special memories with his kids during the days he has them, (unlikely, I know) and then after putting to bed himself, had a trusted person come over for an hour or two while he went out for a late meal, I wouldn\u2019t see the problem with that. I agree though, that he seems like a checked out father already, so the best case scenario is unlikely here.", "Plus if the date isn't going well on a weeknight you always have the \"well I should go I have work in the morning\" excuse", "*You* moved too far from school to have them weekdays.\n\n*You* don\u2019t go out to meet people on weekdays. (Lame) \n\nSounds like you need to make better choices, like not ditching your kids.", "YTA you have 5 nights of free time every week while your ex is giving baths and bed time and actually raising the kids. You only get them 8 days a month and you want to cut that in half that\u2019s disgusting.", "Men be like: Getting laid is more important to me than my own kids. YTA", "This.\n\nOP, move back closer so you are within their school district. It might be inconvenient to you but it would be far better for the children.\n\nHonestly dude, you sound incredibly selfish on every level.\n\nYTA", "can\u2019t up vote this enough", "But then he\u2019s gonna be too tired to actually date from having to actually parent, how selfish of you not to think about OP\u2019s needs!\n\n/s and YTA op", "I don't think his options are as open as he thinks they are; a couple of conversations with this guy and any self-respecting woman will say \"Yeah, no.\"", "Why is the wife terrible?", "And bars/clubs/restaurants won't be crowded, etc", "Considering both kids are under 6, they should both be in bed by 8ish. I wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong with him getting a babysitter for a date that starts at 9. (He\u2019s still the AH though.)", "BINGO", "Yeah this made me so sad for the kids. Like, I cannot even imagine a universe in which I only see my kids 8 days a month, and I want *less* time with them.", "Was thinking the same thing", "\u201cYou keep using that word.  I do not think it means what you think it means.\u201d", "They weren\u2019t saying the wife is terrible. They said that (given the limited info) it\u2019s possible (just possible) the wife wasn\u2019t perfect either, but given the post it seems OP is well and truly the only asshole.", "Do we know he moved out and she stayed? They may have both moved.", "One of my step brothers is like this and has literally never shown up to a court date or filed anything and didn't see his kids for like ten years.", "OP indicated they were the one that moved, but you're right - we don't know that either. Thus, INFO.  It would be good to know the situation, either way.", "It\u2019s three hours away. I am confident that no matter the region, there was another option. Many parents just like me live in less than ideal apartments in cities we hate. Some of us are marginally employed. \n\nBut we see our children regularly. It\u2019s the only thing that matters til they\u2019re grown.", "Not having them sleep in a dangerous area seems more important, thus wanting to know, was it where he could afford that was safe? Was it where he had move? Or did he just leave, because he could? We don't know. It all seems like essential info to have.", "NTA - you should definitely ask! The key to asking a favor is to ask it like it's a favor. Ex wife, I was wondering if you'd be open to having the kids one weekend a month? She says no, then that's that. Notice I said one weekend because well, it seems reasonable.\n\nThe thing is, she might say yes. By this point, she might be thinking gee, it'd be nice to actually do something fun with the kids every now and again.", "Few years down the Road OP will come on here and say my kids have gone NC or LC with me. I don\u2019t know what to do, I barely saw them when they were young\u2026 I moved far away and cut my weekends in half and then it was like 1 day a month. Now they don\u2019t bother to even call me. OP YTA, kids are hard work. Look for other ways to meet people if you are feeling lonely\u2026", "Exactly this. YTA. There\u2019s a reason you won\u2019t ask the people you know - you already knew the answer.", "Agreed. My parents divorced when my siblings and I were aged 1-6. My mom found time to have a babysitter and go out to the bar (where she met my step-dad.) My dad? I'm not sure if this is genius level dating or not: he took us on his dates and used us as his \"escape\" from bad dates on more than one occasion (best one was him having my sister hit me - no, I was not in on the ruse - which ended the date, and Dad took us to go get ice cream afterwards.) No, my dad never remarried, but I think that was more a choice than a lack of dating time.\n\nYTA, OP. Sure, cut down on visitation if you so desire, but I can nearly guarantee you that both your ex AND your kids will have 0 to do with you. Yes, your kids will find/figure it out, as they get older, especially if this attitude regarding them stays in place.", "Yesss! And if he wants a few days off just use pto for the week and do stuff then.", "Yeah. I wonder why he\u2019d assume people will think he\u2019s awful if he tells them what wants \ud83d\ude44 Whose choice was it to move far away so there\u2019d be no weekdays possible? Oh right. OP\u2019s choice. Who now doesn\u2019t even want them on weekends. Poor kids. OP, YTA obviously.", "He so badly wants to have the sex but doesn\u2019t want to deal with the consequences of doing that exact thing!", "I work 12 hr weekend shifts and am a full time single parent. I still managed to date after my divorce. Chances are time is not the reason this dude is not having luck.", "And the reason he only sees them 8 days is because he moved away. He\u2019s TA for the reasoning when he created the situation in the first place.\n\nI feel kind of bad for the ex. It\u2019s not really fair on her to only get all the days that involve \u2018work\u2019 and no fun time. Plus, kids will probably get no weekend activities with their friends if they\u2019re always travelling. Again though, this is a problem of his making.", "The temptation to screenshot this comment and send it to my ex is huge, he finds 2 nights a month hard.", "Yep, sounds like my ex who wants our kid one night every other weekend as he doesn't get any time to relax, poor little lamb.", "my boyfriend and i went on our first date on a wednesday", "My mom woke up early and drove me 30-40 minutes to school and picked me up at the end of her work day for the same drive back for 10 years after the divorce and moving to a cheaper area. Never complained about it once. And there were points in life where my brother went to a different school or once of us had before school programs/ sports making it and extra 1-1.5 hours in the morning. It definitely a chose to stay involved and he just doesn't want to.", "Me too.", "tell that to my ex \ud83d\ude02 he sees his kids 4 days a month and not even overnights. I'm with them everyday and can't do anything. He chose to work away and goes out  everynight, drinking, drugs etc and complains when the kids don\"t want to go with him to \"visit family\" when it suits him", "I work in family court quite often and a lot of the guys in my age range already have kids. I hear quite often about how the evil ex-wife manipulated the family court judge until I say omg no way, which judge? Tell me more about your case because I'm so curious! They always get mysteriously silent, and they get outright angry if I tell them that I know great lawyers who work on custody cases and I'm happy to make a referral because I'm sure their top priority is getting equal custody. I often really lean into it and say I totally understand if we have only free or low-cost dates because I know their priority is their kids.", "Inconceivable!", "Your comment made me giggle imagining the looks on these dude\u2019s faces.\n\nOP\u2019s ex is probably getting some time to herself for the first time in years.", "So your wife spends 5 days a week with them and you are complaining here?!", "NTA \n\nAnd before I get down voted all to hell, please check my reasoning.\n\nI'm giving him an NTA expecting he'll just look for NTAs and not actually read these. I want to support him in his endeavors to remove himself from his children's lives, and give them a better chance of more time with a real father-figure rather than THIS AH as an example.  He's already resentful of the time his children take away from his attempts to get laid. He's self-selecting out of their lives, and that's a great thing in this circumstance. He's an awful example. So i hope he sees this and goes for one weekend a month, and kids' mom gets a real man in her life.", "I literally just made this same comment, scrolled down and saw yours, then proceeded to sad face delete mine.\nThe math really slaps ya hard in the face in this instance tho.", "Apparently Babysitters don\u2019t exist either.", "I am embarrassed to say that in my early 20s I dated someone around 10 years older than me and fell for that shit *hard*. Down to doing all the research and paperwork to try to \"help\" him get more time with his kid (that he never ended up lodging, funny that)\n\nIn the end, I could see the evidence that the situation wasn't how he described it, but it took a lot to sway me that way since I had his version in my head from the start. \n\nTo be fair, it's a story that so many people tell, so it doesn't seem unrealistic. It didn't seem out of place when so many guys complain about the exact same thing. If someone told me that now it would be a very different conversation.", "Right. If he lived closer, he could do a couple of week days and then him and ex wife could alternate weekends", "Bingo!!!! When the kids get older, even though they love their dad, they are going to truly get sick of spending every weekend so far from home. Birthday parties, team sports, sleepovers, etc all typically happen on the weekend with school friends. My kids are teens so their social and sports calendars are FULL, but I remember even in elementary school there are months where it feels like there was a bdayor slumber party every weekend. They also started sports and dance in grade school so weekends have been full in our house for awhile. His kids are going to miss out on a lot. I never understand parents who get divorced and move away from their kids (unless it's military where you have 0 choice).", "I feel more sorry for the ex wife than OP. Imagine doing all the grunt work of parenting and then every single weekend your kids are gone. You don't even get time to take them swimming or on a picnic or to a movie. You don't get to spend decent chunks of time just hanging out with your kid/s without needing to worry about homework and bath and packing lunches for tomorrow and getting to bed on time. That would make me sad", "This! These arrangements always make me feel so sad. I would be upset if I did all the grunt work and then my kid was gone on all the 'free' time. When do you get to go to the zoo, a picnic, a movie, a day at the beach etc. Gosh that'd suck", "He's got the chance to be the \"fun parent\". He's not doing the day to day grind of school, homework or chores. He has the best days of the week to really get to spend time with the kids. Ex is awesome for being willing to give that up for him in the first place. But, he still wants less time with the kids?\nYTA", "I have multiple friends who get assessed for less than $500 per year and their exes still won't pay it. $500 a month is living the high life \ud83d\ude02 /s", "And I would put money on him not being in a great mood with them all the time as well. Because he's probably not used to looking after his own children, and he seems them as cock blockers", "Yep, awfully presumptuous someone wants you.", "Same. I was working 2 jobs when I met my husband. We both have kids and worked really wonky hours when we met. We made time when we could and talked as often as possible. We still have wonky hours but we make it work because we want to. OP doesn\u2019t want a relationship. He just wants to get laid.", "A former friend of my mother dearest said she wished that mindset had been more of a thing when she was a single mom dating.
