You had kids you need to own up to that and take care of them. You are jealous your wife has a partner and got laid. I know everyone has needs but you sound like getting laid should be above your kids. What do you do during the week after work? Can you not get a babysitter to watch the kids while you go on a date?

Your ex already has the more than you and you want to ask her to have even less free time than she already has cause your not getting laid.

You need to do better and stop wearing your posterior as a hat.", "YTA should have just titled it: AITA for wanting to see my kids less so I can get my dick wet??\n\nTo which yes the verdict is still YTA but this way you don\u2019t blame the woman who is taking care of your children all week. Imagine if you had to take care of them during the week? How horrifying for you and your unseasoned penis.", "You ARE an awful person. I bet your wife divorced you because you were so selfish and uncaring.", "YTA. I can tell why you\u2019re divorced! You were probably already doing 7/7 childfree days under the same roof before and now you\u2019re complaining that you actually have to be the main parent for 2 days. Count yourself lucky, there are other separated parents who want to see their kids more rather than less.", "YTA. Work on moving closer so you can alternate weeks.", "YTA. How much free time do you think she really has? Woo, she gets the weekends off and I'm sure she's spending most of those cleaning, doing laundry, and just catching her breath from the prior week. Frankly, I don't like \"dads\" like you that haven't done everything possible to have 50/50 custody.", "YTA dude. My ex and I split 5 years ago, and I have my son every weekend, more whenever I can. They're your kids, they're more important than going out and getting laid.", "YTA: who says you can\u2019t go to the bar during the week? Tinder don\u2019t close on Friday nights. Facebook don\u2019t shut down for holidays. Does your phone auto correct to Friday and Saturday night when typing Wednesday or Thursday? If it bugs you that much, move closer to the kids and pick up days during the week. Then they can stay at your house on the weeks days and you get get them bathed and dressed for bed. Then up and dressed for school. Sorry you can get drunk on Tuesday and enjoy the hangover since you have to work..", "Imagine putting your sex life over spending time with your kids. Top parenting \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc", "YWBTA. You can go it during the week, and hire a babysitter as necessary during the evening on weekends. They aren't young forever", "So you want 8 days to go down to 4 days a month. Your wife will then have them 26 days a month. YTA.  Get laid during the week.  I hope if she agrees that she takes you back for more child support.  And I hope you can't afford to have a girlfriend.", "YBA. \nYour agreement is awful.  \nIt must be so stressful for the kids to never have a weekend \u201cat home\u201d. They always have to travel. \nWhy on earth are you doing this to them? Not for their sake, I\u2019m sure. \n\nI feel sorry for those kids.", "Yep AH\u00b2", "YTA\nI have my kids 8 days a month. It\u2019s not fair. I need free time. Should read I don\u2019t want to be a parent at all. \n\nCry me a fucking river.", "This is what happened with my ex.  Our son is now married and has 2 children.  Guess who isn't welcome to stay more than 3 days on a visit?  Grandpa.  Guess who is welcome anytime for as long as I want?  Grandma.  But I doubt if these comments will get through to OP.  He is focused on Tindr and his kids get in the way.", "Or like\u2026find a trusted babysitter so you can go out on weekend nights after the kids go to bed?", "This. \n\nI was trying to figure out why this guy can\u2019t date during the week? \n\nSure, it\u2019s easier and more traditional to do a Friday or Saturday night, but I dated all throughout the week when I was single.", "Plenty of men manage to have a wife, kids, and a mistress all at once! You just have to be creative with your time management.", "The sad thing is\u2026he can: Sunday night (since he can\u2019t get them to school, let\u2019s face it, he only has them Friday night/Saturday night and sends them home Sunday afternoon) through Thursday. And (if he gets a babysitter)Friday through Sunday afternoon.", "Don\u2019t forget him trying to pawn what little parenting responsibilities he has on his new partner!", "I disagree- OP you still have these kids, they stay forever. It\u2019s not really childfree cause of emergencies that might happen- op need to be responsible", "Bold of you to assume he \u2018remembers\u2019 a task he\u2019s probably never done in his life.", "How much do you want to bet he didn\u2019t help out a lot when they were married?  Too bad he didn\u2019t take on more when his wife was carrying most of it. Guys like this never realize how good they have it till they have to be the only parent for 48 hours and suddenly that\u2019s way too much to ask of them.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

He should sign away his rights and stop burdening his kids with a father that doesn\u2019t want them anyways. I\u2019m sure she can find an upgrade for them.", "This is how it is at my place. I have the kids 5-6 days a week. He gets them every Sunday and about every other Saturday. We are so exhausted from school and work and everything else that we rarely get the fun time. Their dad gets that. Which is cool, I\u2019m glad they get fun weekends with their dad. But it makes me feel like a bad mom for being totally drained all the time. \n\nAlso: YTA OP", "Not only that, he\u2019s ALREADY prioritizing his possible future partner over his kids. I don\u2019t see this ending well.", "OR can people not move too far from their kids to be a part of their whole lives?

After he weaves a sob story about how he wishes he had them more, but their mother totally took advantage of him because he was sooo broken when she refused to help him save the marriage for the children. \nThe the new girlfriend will start looking like a clown by ranting about how awful the ex is, and talking about how SHE is going to help him go back to court for \u201ctheir\u201d kids!\nSame song and dance. The women who fall for these busted bums are pathetic. I would feel bad for them, but they are so eager to look stupid for a man who is not worth it.

When does he get a day to himself. Do you really not understand that?", "He has other obligations besides his kids.

I\u2019m surprised so many people don\u2019t understand that.", "And also why he's still single...", "Especially first dates. It\u2019s such an easy out to say you have work the next day if you\u2019re not feeling it. Also what is stopping OP from hiring a babysitter for a few hours on a Saturday evening. His kids are under six, they\u2019re probably going to bed before you\u2019d meet up for a weekend date anyway. They wouldn\u2019t even have to know there was a babysitter. YTA", "My date nights are weeknights. In the past five years, I've gone on one date on a weekend, and that was several dates down the road.", "I loled a little too hard at this.  I was literally waiting for him to say something like that \ud83d\ude02", "Right \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 this is probably why he can't get laid", "But the mother works 5 days a week and takes care of kids 5 days a week, on top of other obligations like friends, extended family, etc. He can prioritize plans for the 5 nights he doesn\u2019t have his kids.", "So the mom, she works 5 days a week and takes care of the children 5 days a week and gets off 8 days a month. \n\nIf he changes that then mom gets off 4 days a month and he then has all his weeknights free and 2 weekends a month while mom gains 4 days with no additional downtime.", "I definitely prefer weekday dates for this exact reason.\nDon\u2019t want to give up me weekend for dates and also won\u2019t ever be getting crazy or rowdy on a week night.", "I guess we will just have to agree to disagree.", "Oh I\u2019ll get rowdy on a weeknight, just not too rowdy", "Do the math. He\u2019s got every. single. evening. free to do as he pleases. He gets a good nights sleep, every. single. night. He doesn\u2019t have to feed them 3x a day, get them ready for school, deal with doctors, school, homework, daily bathing, he never has to take off for or deal with a sick kid, doesn\u2019t have to arrange care for days off school, holidays, or summers, or any of the other daily things that comes with being a parent. Not sure how you think her 2 days a week is such a big thing, and that\u2019s if it\u2019s actually 2 whole days. Pretty sure he isn\u2019t picking them after work on fridays and bringing them back before school on Monday mornings. He probably picks them up Saturday mornings and drops them off late Sunday afternoon. She\u2019s maybe got a little over 30hrs without the children. If he\u2019s off work at 5 and goes to bed at 11, 5 days a week, he\u2019s got 30hrs, same as her", "Haha oh me too but I\u2019ll get 3 beers rowdy instead of 5 cocktails rowdy"]}
