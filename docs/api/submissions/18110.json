{"id": 18110, "submission_id": "13qtuky", "title": "AITA for not making my two year old say please?", "selftext": "My parents in law (who I absolutely love) watch our toddler (2f) often. This is something they ask us to do at least once a week. She is the only grandchild on this side and my in laws live less than 10 minutes away. 99% of the time this is a lovely arrangement for everyone involved. They love to spoil my daughter, my daughter loves the attention, and we love the break. \n\nA problem has arisen recently though about my daughter\u2019s boundaries. My husband and I (both 29) have been very firm about everyone listening to my daughter when she says no about something to do with her body (no kisses, hugs, whatever). We noticed my MIL in particular was no longer listening when my daughter refused kisses and hugs. This is probably because it was only recently that she was regularly saying no to love from my in laws. So last week we gave the whole family a heads up that toddler was rejecting love more often lately and reminder that she was to be listened to about her body unless it was a safety/health issue. \nEveryone agreed and we went out of town for a week. Well\u2026 the in laws wanted to see the toddler after we got back and that\u2019s when things got messy. \n\nSee, in the week we had been gone my toddler had picked up two new phrases to tell us no, \u201cgo away\u201d and \u201cleave me alone\u201d. My daughter is quite articulate for her age, so these phrases were funny but not shocking to her father and me. Unfortunately, my MIL did not find it funny. When we were picking her up last night all my little girl wanted was mommy and daddy. When asked if she wanted to give kisses goodbye to her grandparents she told them to leave her alone. Having heard her say this all last week, I thought nothing if it. I simply told my in laws not to feel bad and that she was saying that to everyone right now. \nBut this morning I was greeted by a long text from my in laws asking my husband and I to teach my toddler manners. And that if she was going to say things like \u201cleave me alone\u201d she needed to add \u201cplease\u201d  at the end. \n\nI was SHOCKED. And upset. Both at the insinuation that we don\u2019t attempt to teach our daughter \u201cnice words\u201d and at the insistence that a two year old needed to say please all the time. As far as I\u2019m aware most of the children my daughter\u2019s age YELL and HIT and CRY when they are tired and want to be left alone. I was baffled that my in laws were insisting she say please to them. I sent them a long text back (nicely) conveying what I felt about their expectations for our two year old. And then let them know that we DO ask her to say please often, but that we don\u2019t expect her to pick up this behavior for a long time. \nSo AITA for not expecting my 2 year old to be polite when she\u2019s tired? The only reason I\u2019m not sure is because my husband thought nothing of their text. Thought it was a reasonable request. And maybe I\u2019m just being a \u201cmama bear\u201d or coddling her. Or something.\n\nETA: a lot of people are missing the part when I said that we DO ask my daughter to say please and thank you. We just don\u2019t EXPECT her to do it naturally without being reminded by an adult lol. \nAnd I simply didn\u2019t ask her to do it last night because it was past her bedtime and she was on the verge of a melt down. I was just trying to get her home asap.\n\nETA2: many of you think that I think it\u2019s funny when my daughter says go away or leave me alone. Nope. We thought it was funny that she picked up those phrases. We have no idea where she learned them since she doesn\u2019t go to daycare. We thought it was unexpected and therefore funny. Like haha where did she learn that? Obviously it hurt our feelings the first 20ish times she told us to go away. And we imperfect parents remember to ask her to say please about 60% of the time. But we are also ADULTS and realize she\u2019s just using a phrase she doesn\u2019t quite understand to convey that she wants to not be touched , or allowed to be grumpy for a few minutes, or even she\u2019s trying to poop and needs privacy. Some of y\u2019all obviously spend zero time around toddlers.\n\nLAST EDIT: since a lot of you are still here I figured I\u2019d take a last look and answer some of the frequent questions. \n\nMy daughter came with us on the week away. She was not with her grandparents. That was the first time they had seen her in a week and a half (which is a long time for them to go without seeing her) and she was noticeably more shy around them than usual. \n\nYes. My mother in law, and my in laws in general, have had to be reminded of boundaries more than once. This was their third or fourth reminder to listen to my daughter. This is the second time my MIL was the cause of the reminder. \n\nNo. I am not worried about my MIL abusing my daughter (I know she\u2019s safe. But I also have reservations about multiple people in my husbands family who have history of sketchy behavior. But that\u2019s a whole other can of worms we aren\u2019t discussing here). A lot of the clashing about bodily autonomy comes from both generational and cultural differences. \n\nNo. I\u2019m not \u201cdying on this hill\u201d. Lol. The conflict was never about whether or not I would be teaching my daughter manners (we definitely are). It was about whether or not my in laws had any right to be mad about this specific instance and then also backseat parent. \n\nYes. After taking a step back for the day I can see that both I and my in laws way over reacted about this. She\u2019s two. None of this is a big deal. They were probably hurt by my daughter telling them to go away. And I\u2019m pregnant and very emotional rn. So yeah. We blew it out of proportion. My bad. \nIf anyone was wondering it\u2019s all good with my in laws already. They backed off a bit after my text letting me know they had just felt her \u201crudeness\u201d was out of character sine she\u2019s such a sweetie pie normally (you know, cuz we aren\u2019t idiots who don\u2019t teach our child manners). And that they won\u2019t bring it up again.

She won't get it right away but the only way she will eventually learn is if someone models it for her. That's how language is learned.", "YTA\n\nYour daughter is \u201cvery articulate for her age\u201d & has learned \u201cgo away\u201d & \u201cleave me a one\u201d to vocalize her need for bodily autonomy but the word \u201cplease\u201d is too challenging for her to understand? \n\nYou expect everyone to accept whatever comes out of her mouth but asking her to say the word \u201cplease\u201d is offensive to you?\n\nETA \u2014 I\u2019m so confused by your edit.

If you\u2019re teaching her to say \u201cNo\u201d...then isn\u2019t \u201cNo thank you\u201d a more appropriate response to grandma asking for a hug?", "YTA, but only barely. I think you're doing a great job raising your daughter. You're teaching her boundaries! And you're right, she does sound very advanced and articulate for her age. But if she is advanced and articulate enough to understand her boundaries and verbalize them, she is old enough to start learning manners and how to use please and thank you. I'm sure it's cute to you to hear her say \"leave me alone\" but other people don't find it as cute, and the older she gets the less cute it becomes. She's two, so she's perfectly expected to be rude, unruly, etc., but it's never too early to start getting kids in the habit of expressing themselves in healthy, polite ways.\n\nWhen you excuse her behavior by pointing out that she's still better than other two year olds, you're kind of stunting her growth. Don't hold her to the same level as other two year olds if she is more advanced than they are, keep it that way! Don't let them catch up to her by excusing impolite behavior. I honestly don't think anyone here is an AH, but I do agree with your in laws.  And again, it sounds like you're doing a bang up job raising a confident and smart little lady!\n\n**EDIT:** in response to OP's edit- if you really are reminding her to say please and thank you regularly, I don't understand why you would be so \"SHOCKED. And upset.\" Clearly you agree that these are good things she should learn, so why would it be upsetting or shocking to hear that your MIL agrees?  \n\nAnd hey, we all get tired. I'm in my 30s and I can be a bit of a grump and forget my manners when I'm tired. But that's still not good behavior! The earlier you start reinforcing the concept that manners and decency are non-negotiable, even when tired or stressed or frustrated, the less likely she will be to take out her frustration on other people as she grows. By ignoring it when she's tired, you're inadvertently teaching her that she only has to be polite when she feels like it.", "YTA.\n\nThe no kisses thing?  Reasonable.  However that doesn\u2019t mean she gets to be rude.  You don\u2019t always hug or shake hands when you leave a friend/relative home, but you at LEAST say \u201cgoodbye\u201d and aren\u2019t mean about it.\n\nI understand she\u2019s two and she was tired, but that\u2019s the perfect time to teach, \u201cNow honey, we don\u2019t say that.

This entire conversation is batshit insane.", "YTA\n\nIt's reasonable for a kid to develop boundaries around their own body and for you to teach that. \n\nIt is NOT reasonable to teach them that they can demand any adult leave them alone or go away. That's not safe, there are situations where an adult cannot safely leave a child alone or go away.  That's also not practical - your kid won't get to have the option to tell a teacher to \"leave me alone\" or \"go away\" while being corrected about a learning or behavioral issue.\n\n\"Don't kiss me\" can be a command. But \"leave me alone\" or \"go away\" in the context of talking with a caretaker is a request.", "[deleted]", "I'm gonna say NAH. You are being an awesome mom protecting and teaching your daughter. Your in-laws sound lovely as well but they do come from a different generation and it sounds like their feelings were hurt. This is new territory for everyone honestly, we're trying to parent differently than we were and it's an adjustment for grandparents as well. Next time in that situation, maybe address your daughter in a sing-song voice  \"it sounds like you don't want goodbye kisses right now, that's okay. Can you say 'No thank you!\" Even if she's too tired and overstimulated to comply. Then turn to the other party and apologize for the delivery but not the message. We can set firm boundaries while still being kind to the people we love and care about.", "Teach her to say \"No thank you\" when she doesn't want to be touched. :) People will laugh and be less hurt. \n\nWe taught our first born to say please and thank you from the time she learned to talk. When our second child started to speak, without ever being reminded, even once, he started saying \"pee\" for \"please\" and \"ha hoo\" for \"thank you\". To this day we still often say ha hoo. So adorable to hear a 14 month old say \"ha hoo\"\n\nToddlers are such a joy. The \"Terrible Twos\" was probably my favourite age.", "I'm going with ESH and here's why:\n\nI'm also the parent of a small child.  I get teaching them bodily autonomy and saying no when they don't want a hug and a kiss.  I do that with my own daughter but I also model the language and behavior I would like her to use.  My parents and in-laws do the same.  Even before she could speak.  If she pushed away from a hug or kiss we'd simply say \"Oh, no thank you?  Ok.\" and then move on.  So while I don't expect her to always say please or thank you, she is hearing what the preferred response is.  So, if you're just letting the behavior pass because it's new or she's tired that makes you an AH.\n\nOn the other hand, your in-laws are also AHs in this situation.  Expecting an over-tired 2 year old to remember to say please is not quite realistic.  And sending you a long text about it was also out of line.", "Per your edit. She likely learned these phrases from you. Not sure why you would pretend otherwise.", "YTA it's possible to have boundaries and not be a dick about it. Teach your kid common courtesy.

It doesn\u2019t sound like they\u2019re saying she has to say please flawlessly every time. They\u2019re noticing that you\u2019re not bothering to correct the behavior when it happens and are acting like it\u2019s funny.

You're wrong. You can't vogue for most kids your child's age. You can only ever speak for your daughter.

I wonder if MIL spent this visit continuing to ignore that 'no,' or signaling (verbally or nonverbally) that your daughter is wrong to exercise autonomy over her body?  Even if MIL was perfectly well-behaved *this* time, the fact remains that she has very recently shown disregard for your daughter's boundaries. \n\nSo, while your daughter *has* been indiscriminately blanketing the landscape with 'go away' and 'leave me alone,' in this particular instance, when speaking to someone who has very recently ignored her bodily autonomy and forced unwanted physical affection on her, it was entirely reasonable (even if accidentally so) and 'please' can happen if and  when MIL has established a *consistent* pattern of *enthusiastic* respect for your daughter's bodily autonomy. \n\nWhile it sounds like your reasons didn't follow this line of thought, the end result is that you declined to comply with a demand that you require your daughter to soothe the feelings or ego of someone who has not respected her bodily autonomy.

That's so cute!! Yeah- I made that point in another comment- In other cultures, they don't coddle their kids as much about learning. I think it's great that you are teaching her to baby sign. It's going to help her develop communication skills earlier and help her to advocate for herself. She sounds really smart! If you don't mind an unsolicited recommendation, this book really helped me get a head start on reading as a toddler. Not all toddlers are ready to dive into reading, but with the foundation you've given your daughter with language, I bet she'd be able to read pretty early! I can't recommend it enough- the reviews speak for themselves.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Teach-Your-Child-Read-Lessons/dp/0671631985", "Sure, all kids are different; I didn't mean to imply that everyone is ready at that age, just that I think many more toddlers are capable of reading than we realize. But I think most toddlers have the capability to develop rapidly in some area. Some are musically inclined and can begin teaching themselves rhythm, pitch, etc. by 2 or 3. Others are great problem solvers or have excellent organizational skills.  Others learn motor skills at a very advanced rate (mine are still developing, lol). I agree with your last sentence, which was my point. If you just assume your kid can't do it, they won't.\n\nAnd for the record- when I say I could read at 2.5 we are talking \"the cat is big\" kind of stuff- I wasn't reading books by myself until late 3, early 4. I also was not into it at first- I had to be held down in my grandma's lap and  fussed and wiggled and tried to peel back my grandma's hands to see the pictures...it takes a lot of patience.  I don't know your daughter so I am not implying that she's ready when she isn't, I just don't want anyone to think that a protesting toddler is a sign that they aren't cognitively ready. You will have to force them, but in the long run they will be so grateful you did. Teaching me to read early and giving me a love of books is the most incredible gift my grandma could have ever given me.\n\nThis is the book my grandma used, if anyone is curious. It's been around since the 80s and has really high success rates, even with toddlerss: [https://www.amazon.com/Teach-Your-Child-Read-Lessons/dp/0671631985](https://www.amazon.com/Teach-Your-Child-Read-Lessons/dp/0671631985)", "Who said anything about expectations? I don't expect toddlers to understand complex concepts, but why not introduce them to them anyway and see if they surprise you? I would never expect my kid to read by 3, but I'd sure try and see if its possible. No worries if they aren't there yet- but why not try? Look at how early education is conducted in East Asian cultures- toddlers are doing montessori style play and helping put their toys away and tidy the home, learning binary through toys, etc. Heck, watch the show \"Old Enough!\" on Netflix. It's pretty impressive what kids can do when they are given opportunities. I'm just advocating for parents to give their children every opportunity to learn, even if something seems advanced.", "Its still a request.

If I request that you don't touch me, and you do it anyway, there will also be consequences, like my fist in your face and a police report. \n\nBut this kind of illustrates my point.

Redirecting the toddler to say no thank you or no would be the beat response.", "You mean like she agreed the first time?\n\nCome on, this isn't about the lack of please.

If you politely ask someone to stop and they don't, escalate! We aren't saying be polite in the face of danger- just maybe don't respond  rudely the first time. Your original comment implied that, if you use manners first, you put yourself in danger. But your own anecdote kind of refutes that point. My point is that, the type of person who is *so dangerous* that you can't give them the benefit of the doubt by being polite first without running the risk of being SA'd are unlikely to care about what you want, regardless of how you phrase it. \n\nBut yes, some people will hang around and keep trying, but again, it's not impolite to be firm and loud and aggressive after the first no.

You're being a little intellectually dishonest to support your point here, and I don't mean any disrespect because I understand your concern for the safety issues we, as women, face. But you know that the real world doesn't work this way.
