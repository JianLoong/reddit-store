Your feelings are valid. You spent time and energy making something sentimental that she asked for. Of course its hurtful that she didn't use it in its intended traditional way. I still don't think she's an asshole because who knows what went into that decision. Maybe she felt guilted by how much her in-laws spent, figured you'd be the more understanding one. Who knows. \n\nYour son/whoever told her absolutely did not need to take what you told him to his newly postpartum sister who has enough going on between her own recovery and caring for a newborn. I'm not surprised she snapped.", "NTA. Everyone saying \"there's still time to wear the outfit\" are missing the point. The outfit was for a specific event. If you had been asked to make a prom dress, and spent hours and hours of your free time to make it, only for your daughter to wear a different dress to prom, no one would say \"she can still wear it since other time\". Similar situation here. \n\nWhile I agree that it would have been better that this news didn't get to her from a third party, it's understandable you aren't as comfortable speaking with your daughter-in-law as you are your son. This is how my family works: most often, my in-laws speak to my wife and my family speaks to me about issues.", "INFO: Did she ask you to just make the outfit?

It's extremely selfish to ask someone to make something handmade that takes ages of effort, refuse to use it choosing a capitalistic designer brand instead and then get angry that you're upset that your handmade item wasn't used. You are definitely NTA. She doesn't know how lucky she is to have someone who makes this much if an effort. Seems like she's the one focussed on what label the child is wearing, not you.", "NTA.

Talk to her like , good honest conversation,  clarify things with her . That's what you should have done instead of venting and creating this snow ball.", "That\u2019s is a tough one. Did Pam actually tell you the baby would wear this home or did you just assume based on previous experience? \n\nI understand your feelings.

Thankfully your granddaughter is healthy, at home with parents & she can still wear it.\n\nNothing horrible happened here, it just didn\u2019t happen the way you wanted it to. I think you maybe lost some perspective of the big picture. Your son also did not help in this situation. I\u2019m sorry your moment was ruined but it was never really your moment.

Your daughter specifically asked to take part in this tradition. Sounds like, in the end, the in-laws gave her a splashier gift that she wanted to show off. There is nothing you can do, of course, but your feelings are valid and you have a right to be hurt.", "NTA. You\u2019re allowed to be upset about it, it\u2019s disappointing.

Just sleep easy knowing that your daughter was being an AH.", "YTA because while I understand that this is a heartfelt tradition in your eyes, your daughter is allowed to change her mind about what her child will wear when leaving the hospital. It doesn't mean that the outfit you made would never be used, it just means she changed her mind. And instead of telling her that you were hurt by the change, you told your son with apparently no stipulations about not telling others, and let it get back to her from a third party.      \n     \nOf course she's on the defensive, she's a new mom being told she made the wrong decision around something which, to many, is not a decision which needs a ton of thought put into it. Your feelings aren't invalid, but you didn't communicate them effectively, and that makes all the difference.", "NAH, maybe your daughter planned on dressing her baby in what you made and then changed her mind later, that's fine.

You are slightly overreacting to something that doesn't actually concern you.", "I\u2019m torn between NAH and a soft E S H. \n\nWas it a mistake to mention it to your son? Probably. But you worked lovingly on something culturally significant and traditional to your family and that you thought she wanted for a specific purpose.  \n\nShould your daughter have called you on that? Probably not.  She knew that you made it with that specific purpose in mind - and she also shared this child with another parent and there is another grandparent and she\u2019s postpartum and tired.  \n\nYour feelings were and are valid but only you are in a position to make it right - she\u2019s still an new mom and how you handle this will determine the freedom she has to interact with you moving forward.  You can apologize to her for complaining to your son about your gift.  The baby is the blessing.", "YTA because you're only worried about the specific time your grandchild will be wearing the outfit. You are making this about you. I could understand you being upset if you put your time and effort into it and your grandchild never wore it but the baby can wear it other times, unless you've now soured the outfit for your daughter. \n\n\nYou have no idea if she was planning something special for the outfit like maybe newborn pictures. You've jumped the gun and got hurt feelings because she didn't wear it when you wanted her to wear it. I only hope that the baby can wear it in the future without any of you thinking about this situation.", "I'm going with YTA but very, very lightly. They asked you to make it. I know it's special to you, but ultimately, it will have no impact on the child's life what was worn going out of a room, and the important thing is that the child has clothes you made.", "NTA for being a little upset that your outfit wasn\u2019t used, but \u201cheartbroken\u201d? That\u2019s an excessive reaction. If that\u2019s the worst thing that happens to you this year you can be thankful for your good fortune.", "YTA - I know you said she asked for it, but, the key thing here is it's not your child, its her child her call.  From the sound of what you said and how you wrote it, I also see that guilt tripping is heavy here, i.e.; do it in my spare time, it takes months; it was one of the prettiest jobs I've ever done; heartbroken on the way out that she was not wearing what you made.  You are not going to make things better with this, only worse.  You need to call all your kids and tell them to cut the crap with what the hard time they are giving Pam.", "Nta.\n\nIts beenan optional tradition. She is the one who asked.

Then she shouldnt have asked. \n\nI hope that she apologizes. But i bet she wont. This will prolly lead to a ripp between families.\n\nIt sounds like she grew up with $.  People who grow up with $ are not considerate. Usually. It may help to talk to her. Why people are upset explain it to her. The fam also needs to let it go. People already made the fuss.

Ofcourse your daughter can decide whatever she wants to put on her baby, but maybe she could have explained to you why she did it? She must know it\u2019s important in your family. It wasn\u2019t the best \u201cchoice\u201d to talk to your son about it, I also have 5 siblings and we always say it immediately when our mom talks to us (sometimes they also hurt her, so we put them in their place).

I have received homemade gifts and I wore them to family events.", "NTA the clothes weren't just a random present. You put a lot of time and effort into making them, and not on your own idea, but specifically because your daughter asked. It is normal that you took it badly and were upset. Your son ment well in scolding Pam, but at that moment the damage was already done. Pam currently has a lot going on, with her newborn and healing her body, but when she feels better, a nice picture of your granddaughter wearing the clothes you made could be a nice gift to make up to you.", "NTA, it be one thing if you had gone to Pam to scold her, but you didn't. You're allowed to have feelings and be hurt, and you didn't take it out on Pam or your granddaughter.\n\nYou are allowed to discus your feelings, and you spoke about it with your son. All of this is ok and normal. Everyone when they are upset will vent to someone. \n\nThe ah in this story is everyone who spread your personal feelings around and whoever decided to lecture Pam on your behalf without your consent.\n\nReddit be so weird with relatives/inlaws, like if they are even a little upset, reddit is like how dare you that's not your child yadda, yadda, you'll never see your grandkids, That's so extreme. People aren't robots. Feelings can get hurt over minor things, and that's fine. Seriously, wtf, like if my Dad hurts my feelings and I vent to my mom, and she tells everyone how tf am I the ah in that situation? \n\n\nAlso idc what everyone else is saying, but Pam gets a slight ah, and she knows she was a little wrong. That's why she was so angry and defensive. Yes, it is her child, but SHE asked for the clothing and was well aware of the tradition and what it was intended for. It be another thing had you just given it to her but she requested it and then changed her mind when something fancier came along, and that's her right as a parent, but that doesn't mean there wouldn't be fallout, and where she really messed up was not having a conversation with you like \"thanks so much for the clothes we decided to go with a different outfit for that day but I can't wait for you to see her in the clothing you made.\" But she didn't say or do anything, she didn't mention it bc she knew it was hurtful.

It probably feels like you did all that work for nothing. Plus, I understand that it's a special tradition for you. So I get you being upset. You put a lot of time and effort into something for them, at their request, and it wasn't even used. That sucks! And there's nothing wrong with confiding in a loved one about your feelings. Sometimes you just have to let it out haha.", "She is fine not to use it.", "She didn't \"let it get back to her\".

Spent 7 long months making them and then when the time came, they were pushed aside so the parents could look boujie and have the baby leave wearing Gucci. \n\nEveryone saying that there's still time to wear the clothing clearly don't understand tradition nor the fact that there is still time to wear the Gucci outfit as well. \n\nI wouldn't make another piece of clothing at the bequest of Pam, again.

Make no assumptions on why Pam chose to have the child wear what she did.\n\nI agree there is time to wear either.  IMO, a tradition is not, mom did this for the other grandkids.  A tradition is, this has been going on for a couple generations, this may be semantics on my part but it is just how I see it.\n\nFor me the underlying message was not one of hurt but impressing guilt on Pam.

Maybe there was conflict you weren't aware of? There are so many things that could have happened that interrupted her original plan.\n\nMaybe she thought her mother would understand her situation, and she could risk your hurt feelings more than her in-laws, for fear of mistreatment. \n\nYes, your feelings are hurt and it's understandable. But i'm sure something happened that caused this. \n\nYour son needs to learn to either keep things to himself or stop stirring up things in your family. She just had a kid.

I'm sure my mom would have been heartbroken if she'd made something special that my kid didn't wear and I'm sure I would have been heartbroken to be criticized on my first full day as a parent.", "The question here is, why did she change her mind about what the baby wore? Is there a \"political\" reason she used the outfit from her in-laws? There may be tensions there she hasn't told you about.\n\nI totally get you being upset, especially after she asked you to make the Going Home outfit. I am a knitter and know the amount of time it takes, even for baby cloths.\n\nYou are NTA for being upset; however, I think YTA for talking with son instead of Pam about it; your son for spreading it around to others; ESH for taking sides without knowing the full story because things DO get misinterpreted when being gossiped about.", "I\u2019d like to hear the other side of this story\u2026", "INFO: What do you know about the circumstances of Pam leaving the hospital?\n\nThere are a ton of factors that go into what a baby wears on any given day. What's the weather like? What fits? What's clean? What's clean after the baby spits up on the first outfit? Who dressed the baby? Was anyone putting pressure on the new parents to use the other outfit? How was delivery for Pam? When was she discharged from the hospital and how was she feeling?\n\nI am gravely concerned that your daughter was scolded something that happened when she was, at best, extremely tired, in a way you should have understood. For most family, leaving the hospital with a baby is a photo opportunity. For the mother, it's a physically grueling experience. All I wanted was to get home so I could go back to bed. \n\nFwiw, I also knit. When I knit someone a gift I have to make peace with the notion that using it or not is up to them. I knit gifts EXTREMELY rarely, only for people I love so much that I could forgive them for felting my work in the washing machine. If someone has a whole sweater from me, it was a declaration of undying affection: if I would knit you a sweater, I would also give you a kidney. \n\nHandknits can be tough to get onto babies. For babies, I knit blankets. Out of yarn I know washes well.\n\nI am trying to be gentle. I think you owe Pam an apology. This got blown out of proportion. You would love a pic of the baby in the outfit you knitted, but a gift is not supposed to be an obligation.", "You put all that thought, time, and effort into making a special requested gift, that wasn\u2019t used. It really sucks, and I understand why you are hurt. But the thing about gifts is that once you\u2019ve given something, you have no say in how it is used. NAH.\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I know that I\u2019d think twice about making gifts for this daughter in the future.\n\nETA: Is there any chance Pam meant to use the outfit for newborn photos instead?", "Why is it that the information was able to do hostile travel to the point that your other children were scolding your dol after having just given birth? Whichever of your children took it up on themselves to do that on your behalf has dragged you into being the ass hole even if you weren't with your own intentions... They went off on her on your behalf and the timing was atrocious. She just had the baby? Let her be! If you wanted to bring it up you should have talked to her about it before you exposed your hurt feelings to the rest of the group - I don't think you intended to be the ass hole but whoever went after her on your behalf is, and I wouldn't doubt if she sees it as an extension of your thoughts since that's were the regurgitation began.", "And this is why it's important to just have direct conversations with the person you are upset with.", "its possible that the op's daughter was going to have the baby wear the outfit leaving the hospital but the inlaws probably showed up with that outfit and pressured her to put her in the gucci instead and didnt want to argue about it.", "NAH. \n\nI understand your frustration that she asked you to make this for coming home from the hospital, and I sympathise with you. \n\nBut I also know being a new mother comes with its own set of landmines to manoeuvre. \n\nIt's hard to try and please all of the grandparents, and all of the extended family that want to be included in the birth of your new baby. You have to navigate who is likely going to react worse if you decline their offer in favour of someone else's. It's probably just a simple case of who she felt more comfortable with. You're her mother and she knows you will always love her no matter what, but her in laws aren't her blood, it can be so hard to navigate being accepted by your spouse's family that things like this are so incredibly hard to say no to. \n\nMaybe you can plan a \"welcome to the world\" gathering and ask your daughter to put baby in your outfit for it. Coming home from the hospital may seem like a special time but for the parents they're really not thinking much about anything other than getting back to the comfort of their own home.", "NTA, you're allowed to be sad and you're allowed to vent. It's hurtful when your effort feels unappreciated. I'm not sure if your daughter is an AH or not because she does have two sides of the family to make happy. Is the clothing they wear to leave the ward a big deal in your country or is it just a personal family tradition? \nTbh I feel the bigger AH here is your son who took it upon himself to spread round something you had told him privately. I don't know if you were planning on bringing it up with her ever, it definitely doesn't sound like you would have brought it up as a scolding so it feels like other people have turned this into drama", ">knitted clothes and hat for them to come out of the maternity ward...asked me to make it for her daughter...she chose the color red\n\nNTA. I won't even call your son an asshole for talking about this with his siblings, he probably thought he was standing up for you in the moment.

Pam has the right to change her mind but she should have told you she changed her mind so you don\u2019t have the expectation of your granddaughter in the outfit you made.\n\nYour son could have kept it to himself. He asked how you felt and you answered. Now you should probably talk directly to your daughter.", "Why tf did she ask for it then? And pick colors? Nta but the gossip is unfortunate", "NAH but please put this aside else it will become an irreparable rift in your family over a thing that matters so little in the long term. Do you and your daughter want to hold onto resentment over this thus ensuring ultimate alienation from your daughter and granddaughter? Please take time to celebrate your new family member and her mother who is likely going through a lot right now with the new baby.   \n   \nDon\u2019t take it any further because the heartbreak you feel over an item of clothing, so lovingly made, is nothing compared to the pain of disintegrated relationships between loved ones.", "I dont think you're an asshole for being upset, however i think you are for getting worked up this much over it.\n\nYou have new life in your family. Think of the more important parts.", "Nah, you are right to be upset. You started to get a little ah by talking to your son about it. Its best not to talk about what your children did to upset you with the other children. For its most likely for them to tell another sibling and it gets back to the one you upset. Which is exactly what happen. If you need to vent don\u2019t do it with your children if it is about one of them. \n\nYou haven\u2019t talked to your daughter yet. Which means you don\u2019t know why her mind was changed. Maybe she wanted to use it but forgot to talk her partner about before asking you. Then when it came down to it her partner didn\u2019t want to. Which I believe both partners get a say. \n\nNow your daughter should have told you however without knowing when it was decided I won\u2019t call her ah for she was heavily pregnant and may have been too focused on other stuffs to remember to tell you.", "NTA.

She choose not to accept that something.\n\nJust don't put the same amount of effort into something for her going forward. Your time and energy is precious and you should invest it in people that are grateful for it. \n\nYour granddaughter is going to grow up and see that all her cousins got a very special and personal gift, while she didn't. I hope you still kept it so you can give it to her personally when she is old enough to appreciate it.", "NTA. That wasn't just a piece of baby clothing, it was a piece of love, effort and time from you. Of course you would be upset that it was rejected. It's like you being asked to make a prom dress, spending months doing it, then she wears a shop bought one from someone else. It doesn't matter that she might wear it for a different occasion, it was a prom dress, for prom.", "Nta \nYour daughter chose superficially. \n\nI would be so hurt and offended if I worked full time and then spent my free time meticulously creating a beautiful gift for your grandchild making sure it will be ready in time for the special day only for your daughter to act so dismissive and insensitive.", "I\u2019m seamstress. NTA. I\u2019ve been asked to make things for friends and family many times before.

I\u2019m making a wedding gown right now for another friend\u2019s mother. I would be furious if after all the time I have spent on it, she chose to wear something else. My feelings would terribly hurt, and you have every right to be upset right now", "NAH.

It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re disappointed but you should have spoken to your daughter gently and directly.

I'm sure her focus was 100% on birth recovery and new baby, not on your feelings regarding an outfit that will likely be changed 10 minutes after going home.\n\nNow she had to hear through sibling gossip about how you're upset over an outfit while she is recovering and adjusting with the baby.

Maybe by the time she realized baby wasn't wearing your outfit, it wasn't a good time to change and she let it go. I imagine after giving people are distracted by lots of other issues. It could be that they put the outfit on the baby and the fiber reacted with her skin, or maybe they put it on and then the baby had a diaper accident, or they couldn't find it in the bag they brought, or they forgot to pack it, or the in-laws were there and pressured mom and dad to put on their outfit because they spent so much. So, your daughter isn't an asshole either, but you don't know why she didn't use your beautifully handcrafted item because you didn't talk to her about it.    \n\nWhere you do kinda become the asshole, is that you went and talked to someone else about it. It was a thought that was best kept to yourself. Families gossip, and I think you knew it would get back to your daughter. From her perspective, you went and complained about something trivial after she went through something huge, life-altering, and possibly traumatic depending on how the birth went. If I were your daughter, I'd absolutely be annoyed as hell.    \n\nTry to let this go, and remember fondly all the other times a baby went home in one of your knitted items.

I would venture the outfit shouldn't be your priority, either. You sound jealous of the in-laws for buying an expensive outfit.

Maybe she just plain forgot out of sleep deprivation or maybe it simply wasn't close to hand when they were getting ready to leave and she wanted to get home as soon as possible and not fuss about putting a specific outfit on first. \n\nTraditions are not more important than the comfort of a brand new mother and baby.\n\nYour daughter just had a baby.

She looked like a tramp and disrespected the institution of motherhood.\" But no, not that at all. \n\nYou daughter asked you to make this outfit which is culturally worn as a special protection during a specific occasion.

Simple", "Except her daughter told her she did want to follow the tradition and asked her to make the clothes", "Okay and we\u2019re talking about clothes that took op seven months labor to finish. Thats super fucked up to expect someone to donate their time and energy like that and then blow it off. She shouldn\u2019t have asked for the clothes if she was going to be so fickle.", "... and didn't think to tell her mother, who spent months on the outfit, that she wouldn't be using it for the intended purpose.", "That's not how it works, hun. Talk about being dense and dismissive about other people's feelings", "When something expensive was flashed her way...", "Except OP going with her emotions was holding her tongue until she got home(not detracting from the moment like Pam thinks), and then vented to her Son, only after being prompted", "No. I\u2019m saying it doesn\u2019t make a bit of a difference to me one way or the other.", "One of my best friends just finished knitting me a nonbinary flag cardigan. I haven\u2019t even gotten it yet and only seen a picture but I love it. I know how much time they put into it and she didn\u2019t have to but did. As soon as I get it it\u2019ll replace my current sweater as my favourite. \n\nSome people don\u2019t realize how much time and energy goes into knitting and crocheting stuff. I\u2019ve even made a sweater for my own kid that she grew out of quickly but she LOVED it. It didn\u2019t look like much but she wore it to school and proudly told everyone her mom made it. She was 5 and seemed to appreciate it more than Pam does and that makes me sad for OP."]}
