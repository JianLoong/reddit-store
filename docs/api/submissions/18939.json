Your feelings are valid. You spent time and energy making something sentimental that she asked for. Of course its hurtful that she didn't use it in its intended traditional way. I still don't think she's an asshole because who knows what went into that decision. Maybe she felt guilted by how much her in-laws spent, figured you'd be the more understanding one. Who knows. \n\nYour son/whoever told her absolutely did not need to take what you told him to his newly postpartum sister who has enough going on between her own recovery and caring for a newborn. I'm not surprised she snapped.", "NTA. Everyone saying \"there's still time to wear the outfit\" are missing the point. The outfit was for a specific event. If you had been asked to make a prom dress, and spent hours and hours of your free time to make it, only for your daughter to wear a different dress to prom, no one would say \"she can still wear it since other time\". Similar situation here. \n\nWhile I agree that it would have been better that this news didn't get to her from a third party, it's understandable you aren't as comfortable speaking with your daughter-in-law as you are your son. This is how my family works: most often, my in-laws speak to my wife and my family speaks to me about issues.", "INFO: Did she ask you to just make the outfit? Or did she ask you to make the outfit specifically for her to take the baby home in?", "NTA and i hope she doesn't think she's going to her any knitted items for any future children, that is beyond rude.", "You are NTA. It's extremely selfish to ask someone to make something handmade that takes ages of effort, refuse to use it choosing a capitalistic designer brand instead and then get angry that you're upset that your handmade item wasn't used. You are definitely NTA. She doesn't know how lucky she is to have someone who makes this much if an effort. Seems like she's the one focussed on what label the child is wearing, not you.", "NTA. If it\u2019s been a tradition that baby wears this when leaving the hospital, mom shouldn\u2019t have asked you to make the outfit if she had no intention of following the tradition.

Talk to her like , good honest conversation,  clarify things with her . That's what you should have done instead of venting and creating this snow ball.", "That\u2019s is a tough one. Did Pam actually tell you the baby would wear this home or did you just assume based on previous experience? \n\nI understand your feelings. You definitely have the right to feel disappointed however you maybe are missing the big picture of your daughter just gave birth to a healthy baby girl. Thankfully your granddaughter is healthy, at home with parents & she can still wear it.\n\nNothing horrible happened here, it just didn\u2019t happen the way you wanted it to. I think you maybe lost some perspective of the big picture. Your son also did not help in this situation. I\u2019m sorry your moment was ruined but it was never really your moment.

Your daughter specifically asked to take part in this tradition. Sounds like, in the end, the in-laws gave her a splashier gift that she wanted to show off. There is nothing you can do, of course, but your feelings are valid and you have a right to be hurt.", "NTA. You\u2019re allowed to be upset about it, it\u2019s disappointing.

But you shouldn't have mentioned it to your son without assuming it would get back to your daughter.", "OP, you\u2019re NTA. \n\nYou were asked to do something special, you did a great job, and you were hurt.

Your 4 previous grandchildren have all worn the clothing.

Just sleep easy knowing that your daughter was being an AH.", "YTA because while I understand that this is a heartfelt tradition in your eyes, your daughter is allowed to change her mind about what her child will wear when leaving the hospital. It doesn't mean that the outfit you made would never be used, it just means she changed her mind. And instead of telling her that you were hurt by the change, you told your son with apparently no stipulations about not telling others, and let it get back to her from a third party.      \n     \nOf course she's on the defensive, she's a new mom being told she made the wrong decision around something which, to many, is not a decision which needs a ton of thought put into it. Your feelings aren't invalid, but you didn't communicate them effectively, and that makes all the difference.", "NAH, maybe your daughter planned on dressing her baby in what you made and then changed her mind later, that's fine. She didn't throw the clothes away so her child can wear them whenever. You are slightly overreacting to something that doesn't actually concern you.", "I\u2019m torn between NAH and a soft E S H. \n\nWas it a mistake to mention it to your son? Probably. But you worked lovingly on something culturally significant and traditional to your family and that you thought she wanted for a specific purpose.  \n\nShould your daughter have called you on that? Probably not.  She knew that you made it with that specific purpose in mind - and she also shared this child with another parent and there is another grandparent and she\u2019s postpartum and tired.  \n\nYour feelings were and are valid but only you are in a position to make it right - she\u2019s still an new mom and how you handle this will determine the freedom she has to interact with you moving forward.  You can apologize to her for complaining to your son about your gift.  The baby is the blessing.", "YTA because you're only worried about the specific time your grandchild will be wearing the outfit. You are making this about you. I could understand you being upset if you put your time and effort into it and your grandchild never wore it but the baby can wear it other times, unless you've now soured the outfit for your daughter. \n\n\nYou have no idea if she was planning something special for the outfit like maybe newborn pictures. You've jumped the gun and got hurt feelings because she didn't wear it when you wanted her to wear it. I only hope that the baby can wear it in the future without any of you thinking about this situation.", "I'm going with YTA but very, very lightly. They asked you to make it. I know it's special to you, but ultimately, it will have no impact on the child's life what was worn going out of a room, and the important thing is that the child has clothes you made.", "NTA for being a little upset that your outfit wasn\u2019t used, but \u201cheartbroken\u201d? That\u2019s an excessive reaction. If that\u2019s the worst thing that happens to you this year you can be thankful for your good fortune.", "YTA - I know you said she asked for it, but, the key thing here is it's not your child, its her child her call.  From the sound of what you said and how you wrote it, I also see that guilt tripping is heavy here, i.e.; do it in my spare time, it takes months; it was one of the prettiest jobs I've ever done; heartbroken on the way out that she was not wearing what you made.  You are not going to make things better with this, only worse.  You need to call all your kids and tell them to cut the crap with what the hard time they are giving Pam.", "Nta.\n\nIts beenan optional tradition. She is the one who asked. You have every right to be upset. You didnt make a big deal of it. Others did. \n\n But it suck for her to get chewed out over it. If she wasnt planning on using them. Then she shouldnt have asked. \n\nI hope that she apologizes. But i bet she wont. This will prolly lead to a ripp between families.\n\nIt sounds like she grew up with $.  People who grow up with $ are not considerate. Usually. It may help to talk to her. Why people are upset explain it to her. The fam also needs to let it go. People already made the fuss. To keep it going is going to add to the rip. \n\nThis is all imo.", "YTA.", "YTA\n\nThe never said they wouldn't put it on the baby!!! The baby was just born and would have had plenty of opportunities to wear it if you hadn't complained.", "YTA for talking about your daughter behind her back to your son.", "kinda both yta and nta. its a nice thing u do for ur grandchildren but u cant always expect every one of them to wear it when leaving. there'll be many other times when they will happily wear it though. i think you should be more open to that. giving birth is already hectic enough as it is im sure u know that", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Stop causing drama, or you will not be allowed to be in the kid's life.", "Very difficult OP, I can understand you feel so hurt, after spending so much hours, love and care into that outfit. Ofcourse your daughter can decide whatever she wants to put on her baby, but maybe she could have explained to you why she did it? She must know it\u2019s important in your family. It wasn\u2019t the best \u201cchoice\u201d to talk to your son about it, I also have 5 siblings and we always say it immediately when our mom talks to us (sometimes they also hurt her, so we put them in their place). So even tho it was an AH move for him to tell the others, it would have also happened in my family, especially if they\u2019re close. \n\nI think you\u2019re NTA and neither is your daughter. You\u2019re both allowed to have your emotions, sometimes there is just miscommunications that lead to heartbreak. Maybe you can figure something else out to make a moment feel special, like a baby photo shoot or something in your clothes.", "OP- does it have to be specifically worn leaving the hospital and did she know that? I have received homemade gifts and I wore them to family events.", "NTA the clothes weren't just a random present. You put a lot of time and effort into making them, and not on your own idea, but specifically because your daughter asked. It is normal that you took it badly and were upset. Your son ment well in scolding Pam, but at that moment the damage was already done. Pam currently has a lot going on, with her newborn and healing her body, but when she feels better, a nice picture of your granddaughter wearing the clothes you made could be a nice gift to make up to you.", "NTA, it be one thing if you had gone to Pam to scold her, but you didn't. You're allowed to have feelings and be hurt, and you didn't take it out on Pam or your granddaughter.\n\nYou are allowed to discus your feelings, and you spoke about it with your son. All of this is ok and normal. Everyone when they are upset will vent to someone. \n\nThe ah in this story is everyone who spread your personal feelings around and whoever decided to lecture Pam on your behalf without your consent.\n\nReddit be so weird with inlaws, like if they are even a little upset, reddit is like how darw you that's not your child yadda, yadda, you'll never see your grandkids, That's so extreme. People aren't robots. Feelings can get hurt over minor things, and that's fine. Seriously wtf, like if my Dad hurts my feelings and I vent to my mom, and she tells everyone how tf am I the ah in that situation? \n\n\nAlso idc what everyone else is saying, but Pam gets a slight ah, and she knows she was a little wrong. That's why she was so angry and defensive. Yes, it is her child, but SHE asked for the clothing and was well aware of the tradition and what it was intended for. It be another thing had you just given it to her but she requested it and then changed her mind when something fancier came along, and that's her right as a parent, but that doesn't mean there wouldn't be fallout, and where she really messed up was not having a conversation with you like \"thanks so much for the clothes we decided to go with a different outfit for that day but I can't wait for you to see her in the clothing you made.\" But she didn't say or do anything, she didn't mention it bc she knew it was hurtful. Don't knit for her again. I'm sorry it's not worth the physical and emotional labor.", "NAH - this is what you take away from having a beautiful healthy grandchild delivered into this world  - that they didn\u2019t wear the right clothes at the exact time. Hmmmm i get you put a lot of work into it but hey - there is such a thing as priorities.   \n\n\nYou know better now and you can choose to make things for the child out of love or not out of unwillingness to be disappointed.

My vocabulary became clouded once I saw her laying guilt and, like you said, let it get back to her (Pam) from a third party.  I especially didnt like that move.", "How can you say that how someone feels, inside, is overreacting?\n\nShe's allowed to be hurt. She's allowed to be upset. \n\nShe was asked to make the clothes for a specific reason and did so. It took her 7 months of working on these clothes. \n\nMaking clothes from hand, especially baby clothes,  is not easy. It's painstakingly difficult, depending on what's being made. She did it for free, out of love for her daughter and because Pam requested it.", "Shemade these items to be worn from\nthe hospital because she was asked to because of a tradition ,why would she waste her time making them if they weren't being used, new born babies grow insanely fast and by even one week old they can't fit into clothes that they can from hospital.", "So, you're saying that OP is the AH for how she's feeling?\n\nFor feeling upset and hurt.\n\nPeople aren't allowed to feel a certain way, internally, anymore without being called an AH for it?", "Tradition is just peer pressure from dead people... or in this case, those still alive as well", "how?", "babies grow out of new born clothes by the time they are one week old.", "They asked her to make it for the baby to wear home from the hospital. \n\nShe spent a lot of time making the clothes just to have her daughter not use them, in favor of some Gucci clothing so she could look boujie. The baby is going to grow out of the clothes in 5 minutes. \n\nThis lady is NOT the AH for being upset about it. She has EVERY right to be hurt.  \n\nSo, you're saying OP is an AH for having feelings.

Nothing wrong with that. She didn't want to tell Pam, so that Pam wouldn't feel bad (even though I'm sure she doesn't anyways since she made the choice).\n\nHer son spread everything around and it got back to Pam.  OP didn't say anything bad. Just that she was upset. I would be too. Very much so.", "I kind of disagree with you. Remember OP's daughter Pam specifically asked OP to make the clothes and chose the colour.\n\nIf the daughter hadn't asked, then it would be a different situation.", "do you know how fast babies grow", "Exactly. The baby can wear the outfit other places, where even more people can see it.  The fact that she did not wear at this moment does not mean that it is not appreciated or will be frequently used.\n\nYta", "Staying out of it would have meant keeping his mouth shut.

She may have originally, when she asked, fully intended on bringing the baby home in the outfit you made her. Somewhere along the line, she must have changed her mind or something. And she is allowed to. It might suck, but she's allowed. \n\nIt just does suck that she asked you to do all that work for that one moment, and then it wasn't even used. It probably feels like you did all that work for nothing. Plus, I understand that it's a special tradition for you. So I get you being upset. You put a lot of time and effort into something for them, at their request, and it wasn't even used. That sucks! And there's nothing wrong with confiding in a loved one about your feelings. Sometimes you just have to let it out haha.", "She is fine not to use it.", "She didn't \"let it get back to her\". It just got back to her because people are busy bodies and can't help but cause problems when there aren't any like that. \n\nOP has every right to be upset and hurt. \n\nShe was asked to make the clothing for the baby to wear home from the hospital. Spent 7 long months making them and then when the time came, they were pushed aside so the parents could look boujie and have the baby leave wearing Gucci. \n\nEveryone saying that there's still time to wear the clothing clearly don't understand tradition nor the fact that there is still time to wear the Gucci outfit as well. \n\nI wouldn't make another piece of clothing at the bequest of Pam, again. On my own, sure, but thats the only way I'd do it.", "Yeah this type of situation is one of the many reasons that my attitude with my parents is \"look, if there's a way you think I can actually *help* my sibling, by all means tell me.

She knows her kids, she also knows which child of hers will be the conduit to the others.\n\nShe was asked, and like others said, Pam made a different call.  Make no assumptions on why Pam chose to have the child wear what she did.\n\nI agree there is time to wear either.  IMO, a tradition is not, mom did this for the other grandkids.  A tradition is, this has been going on for a couple generations, this may be semantics on my part but it is just how I see it.\n\nFor me the underlying message was not one of hurt but impressing guilt on Pam.  Again, not saying I'm right or wrong, just my perception.", "Do we have the same parents, lol?", "OP didn't chew Pam out, though. \n\nOP intentionally didn't say anything to Pam because she didn't want to cause issues or upset her. \n\nThe son asked OP what was wrong because he noticed she looked a bit down. Her son spread the word around and gossiped about it. OP didn't say bad things about her daughter, just that she was hurt by the events that transpired.\n\nSure, Pam can do whatever she likes, as it's her baby, but OP can be upset because she was asked to do something for a specific reason and then it didn't matter after a better deal came along."]}
