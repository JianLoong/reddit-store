Your feelings are valid. You spent time and energy making something sentimental that she asked for. Of course its hurtful that she didn't use it in its intended traditional way. I still don't think she's an asshole because who knows what went into that decision. Maybe she felt guilted by how much her in-laws spent, figured you'd be the more understanding one. Who knows. \n\nYour son/whoever told her absolutely did not need to take what you told him to his newly postpartum sister who has enough going on between her own recovery and caring for a newborn. I'm not surprised she snapped.", "NTA. Everyone saying \"there's still time to wear the outfit\" are missing the point. The outfit was for a specific event. If you had been asked to make a prom dress, and spent hours and hours of your free time to make it, only for your daughter to wear a different dress to prom, no one would say \"she can still wear it since other time\". Similar situation here. \n\nWhile I agree that it would have been better that this news didn't get to her from a third party, it's understandable you aren't as comfortable speaking with your daughter-in-law as you are your son. This is how my family works: most often, my in-laws speak to my wife and my family speaks to me about issues.", "INFO: Did she ask you to just make the outfit? Or did she ask you to make the outfit specifically for her to take the baby home in?", "NTA and i hope she doesn't think she's going to her any knitted items for any future children, that is beyond rude.", "You are NTA. It's extremely selfish to ask someone to make something handmade that takes ages of effort, refuse to use it choosing a capitalistic designer brand instead and then get angry that you're upset that your handmade item wasn't used. You are definitely NTA. She doesn't know how lucky she is to have someone who makes this much if an effort. Seems like she's the one focussed on what label the child is wearing, not you.", "NTA. If it\u2019s been a tradition that baby wears this when leaving the hospital, mom shouldn\u2019t have asked you to make the outfit if she had no intention of following the tradition. If she hadn\u2019t asked you to do it, then that\u2019s different.", "NTA , your daughter asked for them for that specific moment , so you thought that this tradition was going to continue , otherwise, why would she have asked for them? \n\nIts totally OK to be upset ,after all she snobed it for designer brand , she seems to care more about money  .\n\nEdited for this - maybe talk to her , she also might have been pressured by her in-laws or husband to dress the kid like that . Talk to her like , good honest conversation,  clarify things with her . That's what you should have done instead of venting and creating this snow ball.", "That\u2019s is a tough one. Did Pam actually tell you the baby would wear this home or did you just assume based on previous experience? \n\nI understand your feelings. You definitely have the right to feel disappointed however you maybe are missing the big picture of your daughter just gave birth to a healthy baby girl. Thankfully your granddaughter is healthy, at home with parents & she can still wear it.\n\nNothing horrible happened here, it just didn\u2019t happen the way you wanted it to. I think you maybe lost some perspective of the big picture. Your son also did not help in this situation. I\u2019m sorry your moment was ruined but it was never really your moment. Your kids just chose to do it that way right up until they didn\u2019t.\n\nNAH", "NTA. You went to a lot of work making an outfit she asked for you to make. Specifically so she could bring the baby home in it. And her in-laws swooped in with a designer outfit. Also, you didn\u2019t vent to her; your son is the AH for spreading it around. You were trying to hold it together.", "NTA they asked and you put a lot of effort into it. You have every right to be upset. \n\nHowever it\u2019s time to move on and enjoy your new granddaughter.

Your daughter specifically asked to take part in this tradition. Sounds like, in the end, the in-laws gave her a splashier gift that she wanted to show off. There is nothing you can do, of course, but your feelings are valid and you have a right to be hurt.", "NTA. You\u2019re allowed to be upset about it, it\u2019s disappointing. You put a lot of work into it. Yes the baby can wear it any time but she specifically told you in advance and what color it was gonna be when she could have waited if she wasn\u2019t going to put her in it", "You are NTA for feeling upset. She asked you to make it and you are hurt. You are entitled to your feelings. But you shouldn't have mentioned it to your son without assuming it would get back to your daughter.", "OP, you\u2019re NTA. \n\nYou were asked to do something special, you did a great job, and you were hurt. I think you should sit down with your son and daughter-in-law and explain your feelings because clearly what she got through the grapevine was not the way you said it.", "NTA. She shouldn\u2019t have asked you to go to all that trouble if she didn\u2019t plan to use the gifts for their intended occasion.", "I say NTA.\n\nThis clothing item takes a long time for your to make. Your 4 previous grandchildren have all worn the clothing. Your daughter asked to you make the clothing. \n\nI think it\u2019s safe to make the assumption that the expectation was for grandchild #5 to wear the clothing leaving the maternity ward. Pam blindsided you for sure. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t cause a big fuss about it. This should be a joyful time for the family. Just sleep easy knowing that your daughter was being an AH.", "YTA because while I understand that this is a heartfelt tradition in your eyes, your daughter is allowed to change her mind about what her child will wear when leaving the hospital. It doesn't mean that the outfit you made would never be used, it just means she changed her mind. And instead of telling her that you were hurt by the change, you told your son with apparently no stipulations about not telling others, and let it get back to her from a third party.      \n     \nOf course she's on the defensive, she's a new mom being told she made the wrong decision around something which, to many, is not a decision which needs a ton of thought put into it. Your feelings aren't invalid, but you didn't communicate them effectively, and that makes all the difference.      \n    \nEdit: after reading the edit to the post, my opinion hasn't really changed. OP didn't have to bring it up in the moment, but she 100% should have known that if you vent to one of your kids about another one of your kids, there is every chance that it will make it back to the kid you're upset with. I don't fault her for being upset or needing to vent, but saying that she's blameless for it getting back to Pam doesn't sit right with me. At *best* this is E S H.", "NAH, maybe your daughter planned on dressing her baby in what you made and then changed her mind later, that's fine. She didn't throw the clothes away so her child can wear them whenever. You are slightly overreacting to something that doesn't actually concern you.", "I\u2019m torn between NAH and a soft E S H. \n\nWas it a mistake to mention it to your son? Probably. But you worked lovingly on something culturally significant and traditional to your family and that you thought she wanted for a specific purpose.  \n\nShould your daughter have called you on that? Probably not.  She knew that you made it with that specific purpose in mind - and she also shared this child with another parent and there is another grandparent and she\u2019s postpartum and tired.  \n\nYour feelings were and are valid but only you are in a position to make it right - she\u2019s still an new mom and how you handle this will determine the freedom she has to interact with you moving forward.  You can apologize to her for complaining to your son about your gift.  The baby is the blessing.", "YTA because you're only worried about the specific time your grandchild will be wearing the outfit. You are making this about you. I could understand you being upset if you put your time and effort into it and your grandchild never wore it but the baby can wear it other times, unless you've now soured the outfit for your daughter. \n\n\nYou have no idea if she was planning something special for the outfit like maybe newborn pictures. You've jumped the gun and got hurt feelings because she didn't wear it when you wanted her to wear it. I only hope that the baby can wear it in the future without any of you thinking about this situation.", "I'm going with YTA but very, very lightly. They asked you to make it. I know it's special to you, but ultimately, it will have no impact on the child's life what was worn going out of a room, and the important thing is that the child has clothes you made.", "NTA for being a little upset that your outfit wasn\u2019t used, but \u201cheartbroken\u201d? That\u2019s an excessive reaction. If that\u2019s the worst thing that happens to you this year you can be thankful for your good fortune.", "YTA - I know you said she asked for it, but, the key thing here is it's not your child, its her child her call.  From the sound of what you said and how you wrote it, I also see that guilt tripping is heavy here, i.e.; do it in my spare time, it takes months; it was one of the prettiest jobs I've ever done; heartbroken on the way out that she was not wearing what you made.  You are not going to make things better with this, only worse.  You need to call all your kids and tell them to cut the crap with what the hard time they are giving Pam.", "Nta.\n\nIts beenan optional tradition. She is the one who asked. You have every right to be upset. You didnt make a big deal of it. Others did. \n\n But it suck for her to get chewed out over it. If she wasnt planning on using them. Then she shouldnt have asked. \n\nI hope that she apologizes. But i bet she wont. This will prolly lead to a ripp between families.\n\nIt sounds like she grew up with $.  People who grow up with $ are not considerate. Usually. It may help to talk to her. Why people are upset explain it to her. The fam also needs to let it go. People already made the fuss. To keep it going is going to add to the rip. \n\nThis is all imo.", "YTA.", "YTA\n\nThe never said they wouldn't put it on the baby!!! The baby was just born and would have had plenty of opportunities to wear it if you hadn't complained.", "YTA for talking about your daughter behind her back to your son.", "kinda both yta and nta. its a nice thing u do for ur grandchildren but u cant always expect every one of them to wear it when leaving. there'll be many other times when they will happily wear it though. i think you should be more open to that. giving birth is already hectic enough as it is im sure u know that", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Ofcourse your daughter can decide whatever she wants to put on her baby, but maybe she could have explained to you why she did it? She must know it\u2019s important in your family. It wasn\u2019t the best \u201cchoice\u201d to talk to your son about it, I also have 5 siblings and we always say it immediately when our mom talks to us (sometimes they also hurt her, so we put them in their place).

I have received homemade gifts and I wore them to family events.", "NTA the clothes weren't just a random present. You put a lot of time and effort into making them, and not on your own idea, but specifically because your daughter asked. It is normal that you took it badly and were upset. Your son ment well in scolding Pam, but at that moment the damage was already done. Pam currently has a lot going on, with her newborn and healing her body, but when she feels better, a nice picture of your granddaughter wearing the clothes you made could be a nice gift to make up to you.", "NTA, it be one thing if you had gone to Pam to scold her, but you didn't. You're allowed to have feelings and be hurt, and you didn't take it out on Pam or your granddaughter.\n\nYou are allowed to discus your feelings, and you spoke about it with your son. All of this is ok and normal. Everyone when they are upset will vent to someone. \n\nThe ah in this story is everyone who spread your personal feelings around and whoever decided to lecture Pam on your behalf without your consent.\n\nReddit be so weird with relatives/inlaws, like if they are even a little upset, reddit is like how dare you that's not your child yadda, yadda, you'll never see your grandkids, That's so extreme. People aren't robots. Feelings can get hurt over minor things, and that's fine. Seriously, wtf, like if my Dad hurts my feelings and I vent to my mom, and she tells everyone how tf am I the ah in that situation? \n\n\nAlso idc what everyone else is saying, but Pam gets a slight ah, and she knows she was a little wrong. That's why she was so angry and defensive. Yes, it is her child, but SHE asked for the clothing and was well aware of the tradition and what it was intended for. It be another thing had you just given it to her but she requested it and then changed her mind when something fancier came along, and that's her right as a parent, but that doesn't mean there wouldn't be fallout, and where she really messed up was not having a conversation with you like \"thanks so much for the clothes we decided to go with a different outfit for that day but I can't wait for you to see her in the clothing you made.\" But she didn't say or do anything, she didn't mention it bc she knew it was hurtful. Don't knit for her again. I'm sorry it's not worth the physical and emotional labor.", "NAH - this is what you take away from having a beautiful healthy grandchild delivered into this world  - that they didn\u2019t wear the right clothes at the exact time.

She didn't want to tell Pam, so that Pam wouldn't feel bad (even though I'm sure she doesn't anyways since she made the choice).\n\nHer son spread everything around and it got back to Pam.  OP didn't say anything bad. Just that she was upset. I would be too. Very much so.", "I kind of disagree with you.

She may have originally, when she asked, fully intended on bringing the baby home in the outfit you made her. Somewhere along the line, she must have changed her mind or something.

It probably feels like you did all that work for nothing. Plus, I understand that it's a special tradition for you. So I get you being upset. You put a lot of time and effort into something for them, at their request, and it wasn't even used. That sucks! And there's nothing wrong with confiding in a loved one about your feelings. Sometimes you just have to let it out haha.", "She is fine not to use it.", "She didn't \"let it get back to her\". It just got back to her because people are busy bodies and can't help but cause problems when there aren't any like that. \n\nOP has every right to be upset and hurt. \n\nShe was asked to make the clothing for the baby to wear home from the hospital. Spent 7 long months making them and then when the time came, they were pushed aside so the parents could look boujie and have the baby leave wearing Gucci. \n\nEveryone saying that there's still time to wear the clothing clearly don't understand tradition nor the fact that there is still time to wear the Gucci outfit as well. \n\nI wouldn't make another piece of clothing at the bequest of Pam, again.

Make no assumptions on why Pam chose to have the child wear what she did.\n\nI agree there is time to wear either.  IMO, a tradition is not, mom did this for the other grandkids.  A tradition is, this has been going on for a couple generations, this may be semantics on my part but it is just how I see it.\n\nFor me the underlying message was not one of hurt but impressing guilt on Pam.

OP didn't say bad things about her daughter, just that she was hurt by the events that transpired.\n\nSure, Pam can do whatever she likes, as it's her baby, but OP can be upset because she was asked to do something for a specific reason and then it didn't matter after a better deal came along.", "NAH\n\nYes she asked you for it for a specific moment,\n\nBut she's freshly post-partum, and handed an expensie outfit by her in-laws. Maybe it was the pressure, maybe she didn't have the energy or the heart or brave enough to stand up for herself in that moment. Do the in-laws treat her well?

It got ruined before we left the hospital (both poop and formula, never did get the stains out). I wish I had saved it for a few days until I was more confident and my baby oozed less unexpectedly gross substances. I was also exhausted and hadn't slept in 2 days. I'm sure my mom would have been heartbroken if she'd made something special that my kid didn't wear and I'm sure I would have been heartbroken to be criticized on my first full day as a parent.", "The question here is, why did she change her mind about what the baby wore? Is there a \"political\" reason she used the outfit from her in-laws? There may be tensions there she hasn't told you about.\n\nI totally get you being upset, especially after she asked you to make the Going Home outfit. I am a knitter and know the amount of time it takes, even for baby cloths.\n\nYou are NTA for being upset; however, I think YTA for talking with son instead of Pam about it; your son for spreading it around to others; ESH for taking sides without knowing the full story because things DO get misinterpreted when being gossiped about.", "I\u2019d like to hear the other side of this story\u2026", "INFO: What do you know about the circumstances of Pam leaving the hospital?\n\nThere are a ton of factors that go into what a baby wears on any given day. What's the weather like? What fits? What's clean? What's clean after the baby spits up on the first outfit? Who dressed the baby? Was anyone putting pressure on the new parents to use the other outfit? How was delivery for Pam? When was she discharged from the hospital and how was she feeling?\n\nI am gravely concerned that your daughter was scolded something that happened when she was, at best, extremely tired, in a way you should have understood. For most family, leaving the hospital with a baby is a photo opportunity. For the mother, it's a physically grueling experience. All I wanted was to get home so I could go back to bed. \n\nFwiw, I also knit. When I knit someone a gift I have to make peace with the notion that using it or not is up to them. I knit gifts EXTREMELY rarely, only for people I love so much that I could forgive them for felting my work in the washing machine. If someone has a whole sweater from me, it was a declaration of undying affection: if I would knit you a sweater, I would also give you a kidney. \n\nHandknits can be tough to get onto babies. For babies, I knit blankets. Out of yarn I know washes well.\n\nI am trying to be gentle. I think you owe Pam an apology. This got blown out of proportion.

NAH.\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I know that I\u2019d think twice about making gifts for this daughter in the future.\n\nETA: Is there any chance Pam meant to use the outfit for newborn photos instead?", "Why is it that the information was able to do hostile travel to the point that your other children were scolding your dol after having just given birth? Whichever of your children took it up on themselves to do that on your behalf has dragged you into being the ass hole even if you weren't with your own intentions... They went off on her on your behalf and the timing was atrocious. She just had the baby? Let her be! If you wanted to bring it up you should have talked to her about it before you exposed your hurt feelings to the rest of the group - I don't think you intended to be the ass hole but whoever went after her on your behalf is, and I wouldn't doubt if she sees it as an extension of your thoughts since that's were the regurgitation began.", "And this is why it's important to just have direct conversations with the person you are upset with.", "its possible that the op's daughter was going to have the baby wear the outfit leaving the hospital but the inlaws probably showed up with that outfit and pressured her to put her in the gucci instead and didnt want to argue about it.", "NAH. \n\nI understand your frustration that she asked you to make this for coming home from the hospital, and I sympathise with you. \n\nBut I also know being a new mother comes with its own set of landmines to manoeuvre. \n\nIt's hard to try and please all of the grandparents, and all of the extended family that want to be included in the birth of your new baby. You have to navigate who is likely going to react worse if you decline their offer in favour of someone else's. It's probably just a simple case of who she felt more comfortable with. You're her mother and she knows you will always love her no matter what, but her in laws aren't her blood, it can be so hard to navigate being accepted by your spouse's family that things like this are so incredibly hard to say no to. \n\nMaybe you can plan a \"welcome to the world\" gathering and ask your daughter to put baby in your outfit for it.

My boys were the first grandchildren for my parents, and everyone was so excited that they were coming that his aunt and her family spent months making these amazing dresses. I am talking hand-made lace and everything. She sent them to me right after they were born and then was horrified when she realized that she got the gender memo wrong.  I thanked her profusely and put those boys in those dresses and posed them adorable photos. I sent her a thank you gift with the photos and let her know that I had them professionally preserved and sealed so that my eventual granddaughter(s) would be able to wear them. That was 25 years ago and I am waiting for those grandchildren.  The dresses look as beautiful as the day they were made. \n\nIt\u2019s just about appreciating the love and time others put into caring for you.", "NTA. I'm sorry this happened. Very hurtful. I hope you can take comfort in a loving relationship with your new grandchild.", "It broke Traditons so that hurts.\n\nIn the grand scheme it doesn\u2019t matter, the baby wore clothes some relative bought her", "NAH, fellow knitter. I can tell you exactly how many times I've knitted a requested item for someone and they never wore it. 3 times: my husband, MIL, BIL. One sweater each, and they were gorgeous. Never again. I only knit for myself now, or I surprise someone who I 100% know will love it, because the other person and I have had multiple conversations about knitting. It hurts for sure, but I don't bother bringing it up, I just assume they ultimately don't like it or they don't understand how much time it takes. So, you're not an asshole for being hurt.   \n  \n\nThat being said, you never know why someone didn't wear a specific item. It could've been that someone else dressed the baby while mom was dealing with a health issue. Maybe by the time she realized baby wasn't wearing your outfit, it wasn't a good time to change and she let it go. I imagine after giving people are distracted by lots of other issues. It could be that they put the outfit on the baby and the fiber reacted with her skin, or maybe they put it on and then the baby had a diaper accident, or they couldn't find it in the bag they brought, or they forgot to pack it, or the in-laws were there and pressured mom and dad to put on their outfit because they spent so much. So, your daughter isn't an asshole either, but you don't know why she didn't use your beautifully handcrafted item because you didn't talk to her about it.    \n\nWhere you do kinda become the asshole, is that you went and talked to someone else about it. It was a thought that was best kept to yourself. Families gossip, and I think you knew it would get back to your daughter. From her perspective, you went and complained about something trivial after she went through something huge, life-altering, and possibly traumatic depending on how the birth went. If I were your daughter, I'd absolutely be annoyed as hell.    \n\nTry to let this go, and remember fondly all the other times a baby went home in one of your knitted items. And, I cannot stress this enough, knit something for yourself.", "NTA.

But everyone in the family decided, yes, let's make this hospitalized, bleeding woman a villain and center the grandmother's feelings instead (who yes, made an outfit, but c'mon, the daughter made a whole person!)\n\nOr maybe the outfit wasn't the priority for these new parents. I would venture the outfit shouldn't be your priority, either. You sound jealous of the in-laws for buying an expensive outfit.

No one? No one saw us when she came home, minus the nurses. Yes, it's very symbolic but she can pop the baby in the mom's outfit that night or to a family party or whatever. I did a cute little photo shoot with my daughter in her dress about a week later. It's perfect and had no stress attached. \n\nWhat mattered so much to me before the birth - adorable muslin dress - was way too overwhelming to navigate in the actual moment.

Maybe she just plain forgot out of sleep deprivation or maybe it simply wasn't close to hand when they were getting ready to leave and she wanted to get home as soon as possible and not fuss about putting a specific outfit on first. \n\nTraditions are not more important than the comfort of a brand new mother and baby.\n\nYour daughter just had a baby.

I totally get OP in the that she never insisted on making it but was literally asked to, it was literally a favor and not just a gift. It's why I say the daughter needs to make the exact same thing so she understands why her mother is upset and so she can appreciate the work put into it. I've crocheted blankets for boyfriends before and that's just literally a giant rectangle, no complicated pattern or sizing or symmetry to follow, and it took me 2 months and over $300 in yarn to make. And even my bfs, none of whom crochet, understood the undertaking required to make it and they cherished the fuck out of my amateur blankets. OP's daughter can't even appreciate the effort by apologizing and thanking their mother, which I'm sure would go a long way to placate her disappointment, instead she doubled down on insulting the FAVOR given to her. Gross. OP didn't even bother daughter with her disappointment.

Was the outfit appropriate for the weather? Maybe it was too heavy for that particular day and daughter was worried about baby overheating.\n\n2. How complicated is the outfit? OP makes it sound like it was the fanciest she\u2019d made so far. Maybe it was too much hassle compared to a onesie for a postpartum c-section mom.\n\n3. Did daughter pack the bag? Could somebody have packed it for her like husband or in-laws and forgot the handknits?\n\n4. What were the hospital guidelines for discharge? Would the outfit get in the way of the car seat? Nursing staff won\u2019t discharge if baby isn\u2019t safe in the car seat.\n\nThat\u2019s not even touching on why OP didn\u2019t think about how quickly the rest of the family would move to attack daughter.

Leaving the hospital is a crazy and exhausting process and there are so many unknowns when you go in. I also knit, and made several special items for my second baby who decided to be 99th percentile across the board in size. The hat and boots would not fit onto him even enough for a photo op. With my first he went through three partial clothing changes in the last twenty minutes before we got in the car because of separate diaper blowout and spit up incidents. \n\nOPs not wrong for being disappointed but she really should have spoken with her daughter before causing drama over it with the whole family.", "This is the only sensible reply.

You cannot change how someone feels just because you feel insulted and embarrassed. Instead she blew up on OP for being upset with her and because the people in her life were siding with her. It\u2019s just distasteful and disrespectful to make a request for something that takes a lot of time, and personal time at that, to make just to then not use it for its intended purpose. OP clearly states that she only vented to her son about the situation, she never intended for their conversation to leave the room", "Thank you so much for this reply.

It's a bamboo breathable footie that's meant for summer wear. \n\nI'm sure OP's outfit is beautiful and crafted with so much love. I know it was requested by the daughter, but when it comes down to it what baby wears home from the hospital has to be suitable and safe for baby. Babies overheat easily. \n\nI also don't see OP as TA, because she never intended for anyone to scold her daughter for this. She respected their space, and was quietly disappointed. \n\nNTA, but the situation is understandable", "I'm wondering about the pattern. Pam got to pick the colour, but did she have any input into the style of baby clothes?

OP mentions in the post that it made it to the new mother via someone scolding her for doing that, which was likely them trying to hold her accountable it just...

An explanation and apology is the most logical thing, yes, and it's what she should be doing *no matter the situation*, but what happens is that people often realize their relationship might not be great, and they either dig their heels in to pretend it's great (because otherwise they have to confront those emotions), or they retreat further into the relationship. Let's say the in-laws did pressure Pam: if she explained and apologized, yes that's the right thing, but then she has to open up and completely unload everything that's happening. That's a draining, possibly devastating process. Additionally, she has to process her mom's emotions as well, and possibly deal with the fallout of what if a relative overheard and a bigger mess is made? Much easier to just bottle it up and lash out. It sucks, and it's not something that people are aware of happening, so they show extremely little leniency when it happens. \n\nNot to mention, postpartum is an infamously difficult and emotional time. \n\n> you're literally suggesting it would be acceptable\n\nWhere the ** am I suggesting that it's \"acceptable\"? What I'm trying to say is that these situations are never as simple as \"Oh fuck my mom! My in-laws told me to.\" When you are married with kids, you're not operating just on your own desires and ideals. You're basically tip toeing over a whole ass minefield. (Money is only one factor, that I list specifically because it muddies so many relationships. But lots of other things--childcare! keeping the peace in the marriage! relatives!--are involved.)\n\nI mean yeah, all of this is hypothetical. Pam could totally be a clout seeking, insensitive person who doesn't care at all about her mom. In which case she's 100% the asshole. But what I'm getting at is, we're really not getting the full picture, and while what Pam did was extremely callous, it's not fair to put the blame solely on her back when there could be lots more going on. Regardless, the mom is fully in the right here to not be upset, and she definitely is not the asshole. \n\nEdit to add: You also need to understand not everyone has a strong, shiny backbone. As someone else whose response to most things that violate my boundaries is to walk away, I didn't understand this for much of my life. But many people just don't have that backbone, or are in the process of growing that backbone (because growing one in adulthood will take much longer than growing one as a child). Some of those people are going to be people you love in some capacity. It's infuriating to see, and many of these people are never going to grow a backbone. But some of them are fully capable of growing on a reasonable timescale.", "The daughter telling op that she was making the moment about her and not her granddaughter is ridiculous.

I wouldn't put a baby in anything knitted - even a 100% flax (linen) yarn - and take them outside for 5 minutes in this weather for fear they would overheat. \n\nThere are as many reasons someone may choose not to wear (or have a baby wear) even a requested handmade item as there are asymmetrical shawl patterns. \nFear of ruining the item, because it did take so much of the maker's time, is the most common excuse I hear from my family & friends, and is the most often relayed excuse/lament by other fiber artists I see at maker hangout events when gift knitting comes up. \n\nSimply add DIL to your non-knitworthy list and keep the knitted stuff for your new grandbaby to a minimum until she grows up some and can ask for and respect the items (or learns how to knit her own stuff from you).", "NTA \n\nI think OP is right to be upset. Whilst the other grandchildren have all had a maternity ward outfit knitted for them, OP specified that it is only on request. I presume that also means OP doesn\u2019t bring it up whenever there is a pregnancy announcement. Additionally, all the knitting is done outside of working hours. So for Pam to have REQUESTED an outfit AND be involved with the colour choice, it would seem like she is excited and appreciative of all the time and effort OP puts into the outfit. \n\nI\u2019m not sure when Pam\u2019s in-laws got her the branded baby clothes but I\u2019m guessing it wasn\u2019t planned and prepared 7 months prior to the delivery day. So for all the effort and love that OP put into the outfit to be just thrown out, it\u2019s more than justified to be upset. Additionally, OP STILL put her daughter\u2019s well-being first in the moment and simply put the other set of clothes on and helped her and her new grandchild out of the maternity ward. \n\nNTA", "I agree with the OP.

You have a right to feel your feelings <3", "All of this drama could have been avoided with a quiet chat with Pam after the event.

What if Pam\u2019s in-laws put a great deal of pressure on Pam for the Gucci-esque outfit to be worn, say as a trade-off for only Pam\u2019s mum (OP) being allowed to assist in the maternity ward? What if Pam\u2019s husband packed the baby suitcase and insisted his parent\u2019s outfit be used.. this could already have been a topic of contention amongst Pam and her husband? What if Pam miscommunicated and didn\u2019t want the outfit for leaving the ward but for the baby\u2019s church dedication ceremony or the social media announcement of the birth, so it\u2019s just a case of mismatched expectations?\n\nWhat a shame that after carrying a baby for 9 months and going through labour, Pam can\u2019t catch a break. I don\u2019t blame her reaction at all if she\u2019s criticised within days of the delivery for something which in the scheme of things doesn\u2019t matter. I say this with empathy for OP\u2019s knitting efforts and feelings, but it\u2019s not a life or death choice for the baby who will still be in good health. Now all Pam will remember about the period post-labour when she\u2019s at her most vulnerable is the drama her siblings stirred up.\n\nThis is a good (and hard) lesson on gifting without expectations or attachment to how we\u2019d prefer the gift to be received/used.

Because the way I see it is that every baby gets a special outfit from you and it shouldn't matter when they wear it since walking out of the maternity ward isn't anything special. It really shouldn't be about that. Just because they didn't put it on the baby when leaving the hospital doesn't mean that they're not going to use it. They asked for it because they wanted it and plan to use it multiple times. And did she explicitly know that walking out with the outfit on was the prize jewel?

Maybe baby was bigger or smaller than outfit was, since you literally have no clue the exact measurements of a newborn until they are born. People bought me things for my daughter, but yes I asked for, but I had no idea that I wasn\u2019t going to use them because she outgrew them to quickly or didn\u2019t ever fit them to begin with.

Why was what she wore for 15 mins the most important thing? And no offense, but I can\u2019t afford things like Gucci or Prada, or anything designer like that. If someone would\u2019ve gifted my daughter with an outrageously expensive outfit, I would\u2019ve absolutely felt pressured to put her in that to come home and or to be seen in first, only because do you have any idea how much that probably cost yes I\u2019m aware you spent months making that dress, but that Gucci outfit was probably a good thousand dollars. That\u2019s a lot of money yours was a lot of time I\u2019m sure she had more sentimental plans for yours, and the fact that someone just gifted them $1000 baby outfit put pressure on her to make sure that it was worn at least once. Either way soft YTA I understand you put a lot of time and effort into it, but at the end of the day, Baby is healthy, Mom is ok, but tired, in pain, and was gifted a high-pressure outrageously expensive baby gift she likely felt she had no choice but to use. Cut her some slack.", "Yup NTA daughter can dress her kid how she wants but to ask for someone to hand make an outfit for a very specific special moment and then not use it is kind of wrong. OP was right for not making fuss in the moment but she is allowed to express her feelings in a normal way.

The only way I would not be agreeing with a NTA verdict is if OP had been forcing the issue the entire time and been persistent and pushy about it, and made the thing after being told not to.

The victim-seeking op is being extremely disingenuous", "Given the pressured, stressed environment that surrounds childbirth, especially with the first-born child, the onus is still on the mother to use her communication skills and *ask* why her outfit wasn't being used, instead of stewing on it. \n\nThe answer could be, \"yeah I liked the Gucci logos better so [infant]'s never gonna wear yours, sorry\", in which case Pam would be TA. \n\nBut the answer also could be, \"You know, it was so messy when [siblings] gave birth, the outfits were never the same afterward. I appreciate the care and attention that you put into making this, so I wanted to save your outfit for later in the week, to avoid it being ruined.\" \n\nIt's all speculation since, again, the mom didn't ask for an explanation, just sat on her hurt feelings until it came to light in a more explosive way than necessary.", "I also really want to interrogate who all had opinions about what the baby wore home and how those pressures complicated things. Did Pam's ILs give the other outfit? Did that gift. Ome with strings? Was Pam maybe dealing as best she could with competitive grandparents? Who packed the hospital bag, when was it packed, when was the birth, certificate as the C-section scheduled in advance or not?

So not less than the kid who it got made for, my aunts, my brother and me, several cousins etc who were visiting my grandparents and now my daughter used this blanket.\n\nIt's still nice and perfect for changing seasons when it's to warm for a tightly crafted blanket, but to cold for using none.\n\nPS: If you use something and it starts to wear out/get thin, you can also patch it up BEFORE it has holes in it. There are nice and easy How To... on YT :)", "Use the blanket my darling. That\u2019s what granny why\u2019s made.

My friends husband had just died and she didn\u2019t have money for a gift so she asked if the blanket would be okay. I was so happy with it because I had memories of seeing her crocheting with him chatting next to her before he passed. \n\nI\u2019ll always treasure it and when tho it doesn\u2019t match I use it all the time in the winter.  Another friend made bunting, curtains and a quilt for my camper.

I brought it to the hospital each time I went into labor and handed it to the nurse who would be diapering and swaddling my babies after they were born.\n\nWith my daughter,  I had a scheduled c-section turned emergency when my water broke before the surgery date. We were so scared we didn't even think about the hat, which was in my bag, while I was rushed into surgery and the nurses put a hospital hat on her. Best believe I ripped that thing off immediately when I got to hold her and put the hat my momma made on there. Her hands touched that hat and that meant she was touching my baby and that meant everything to me.\n\nNTA.

It was a cesarian birth. That's a significant piece of bodily trauma. I can't imagine making such a stink about an outfit.", "It's OP's right to be upset over this, but I don't think \"heartbroken\" is the right word here. \"Heartbroken\" is a word you use when someone has died.", "No, she was \"heartbroken\" over the clothes themselves. Not the confrontation.\n\n> I was heartbroken on the way out of the maternity ward when I found out that my granddaughter would not wear the clothes I made, but one that Pam got from her in-laws from a very expensive brand (like Gucci).", "It could have clearly been too big for a newborn so mom decided to save it for a later occasion", "I wondered if OPs daughter felt like she couldn\u2019t say no to her in laws.

If her daughter was feeling trapped and scared of her mil, why couldn't she just tell her mom that? Why just make it all about the mom being manipulative and attention seeking? I could see being too tired pre birth/at birth, but this is now 20 days in, daughter hears rumors through the grapevine that mom is upset, and instead of calling mom to verify (because phone tag) and talk about it, she calls in on the offensive. Straw that broke the camel's back? Maybe, but I'd expect someone to cool down and apologize pretty quickly for an outburst like that, no matter how stressed they are, I mean it's her mom and presumably (?) they've had a good relationship till now? I mean, I admit we don't have the daughter's side on this so there are some assumptions here on my part, but if it turns out OP already has a rocky relationship with Pam then that changes things drastically.

No matter how fair and even you try to be you have a child that acts like you favor the others or don\u2019t love them the same.

You made it for the occasion that it would be your granddaughters first outfit, you made it under the (rightful) assumption that this outfit would be worn to celebrate her birth and wish her whatever the colour red means to you. I would be upset too, especially if the person had asked. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot to mention you only talked to someone about it because you were reasonably upset and needed someone to vent to which there is nothing wrong with. You deserve to have someone support you when you're upset and you had every right to be.

People can call me dramatic if you want but these are my thoughts on the matter", "NTA. I crochet and I rarely do it for family because it is almost never appreciated. If I made something for my grandchild at my daughter\u2019s request for a one time event and she didn\u2019t put it on the kid, I\u2019d be hurt and angry. If it didn\u2019t fit, I wouldn\u2019t be upset. Doesn\u2019t sound like that is what happened here. I\u2019d be frustrated with my son for not keeping his mouth shut and my daughter for being angry with me. You didn\u2019t make the moment about you, you said nothing during that moment. I\u2019d be done making anything for your daughter or her children (at least until they are old enough to ask). I don\u2019t know if you frequently help out, you mentioned you stayed two weeks.

For how much this subreddit loves to harp on communication, there sure is a lot of excuse making in this thread.", "We have this tradition in my family, only the outfits are crochet instead of knitted. If a grandmother had BEEN ASKED and then created the crochet dress or onsie and the mother had just threw on a designer onsie without saying a single word in advance there would be world war III kicking off in the extended family. For those of us that follow the tradition this is hands down the rudest thing I've ever heard.\n\nHaving said that, some people just don't like the tradition so no effort is expended on bespoke clothing for their child. It's the asking and agreeing to follow the tradition and then just not even caring because someone threw a designer label the mom's way that makes me shake my head.\n\nIt doesn't matter than she just gave birth, if the husband insisted, she wanted to impress the in-laws or was just star struck by the designer label and how cool like would look on their social media.

It seems crazy to me that anyone would spend a lot of time or money on an outfit for a baby that will be worn once for a few hours. I don\u2019t understand the point.

I think I would have told my mom ahead of time if that was the case.", "Honestly, that's something I don't get. I'm Greek Cypriot on my Mum's side, and was basically raised in that culture, even though I was born in the UK and grew up here. I literally didn't know what a baby shower was, until I was like... 29 and watched this movie. Father of the Bride Part 2. That's when I saw them have a baby shower. Was so completely lost. Asked my Mum wtf? She basically explained it to me. I was like \"Why don't we do them?\" Just out of curiosity. My Mum said \"In our culture, we believe its bad luck to celebrate a baby before it's born. The parents don't buy stuff for the baby directly, until after it's born. It's considered tempting fate. If you want something for your kids, you can give the money to someone else, and they can buy it for you, to negate bad luck, u til after they're born.\" So while I've heard of most of these American/English traditions, I've never participated in any. So I know about the wearing an outfit home from the hospital thing, but literally don't know why it happens.", "When I was expecting my first, I picked out an adorable frilly pink dress with lace, ruffles, etc. Newborn size. As it turned out, she was much smaller than expected (5 pounds 12 ounces, 18 inches long, and yes she was full term) and even the newborn-sized things were too big. My mom went to Walmart and got what she could find in premie size: footed pajamas. That was literally all they had. So, my daughter came home in footed pajamas.

She's now 20 and healthy as can be!", "Yup, cards would have been on the table instead of a hard bluff.", "The times I knitted stuff for friends baby's I asked beforehand if the colour choice and the pattern is their taste.\n\nLike a cappuccino coloured (the request was a neutral/nude colour, so it's unisex) open Cardigan with a matching scarf (this kind there you can put the end through the other, so its not getting lost) and matching tiny gloves. I broke two needles on this damn gloves, cause it was so fidgety and on tension nearly at the end \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude48\n\nOr the same kind of cardigan but made from cotton (summer baby) and in a nice corn flower blue, cause the baby mother loves blue.\n\nI would never work hours and hours on something, that will in the end never will be used.\n\nLike I got gifted several knitten baby jackets and they were all way to loose, cause our kiddo is very fragile in statue. Also one is antique pink (I hate pink in any kind of variation) and the other mustard yellow... Also not really my favourite colour and nothing to combine it with.\n\nThe beanies which came with them were also to big and by the time the head if our kiddo was big enough, they were to short to reach over the ears. Also nobody make friggin bands to secure the caps. Like why tf would you do this?!? Babys look around and always turn their heads, so it's a matter of 30 seconds, that I need to readjust it.", "oh how sad is that. a gift made by a loved one is way more special than a store bought. who cares if it matches its not about that. your sil is very superficial and vain.", "Yeah, as a fellow crafter, I understand that we have the best of intentions when making a gift, particularly a baby gift. But you also have to have the  self awareness to realize that not everyone is going to want a handmade gift, or appreciate the work that you put into it. It can also put the gift receiver in an awkward position because a homemade gift is higher stakes when it comes to hurt feelings. Also, it's harsh but you're right. Sometimes a project is something only the maker can love. We all have different tastes and learning curves. \n\nMy basic rules of thumb for craft gifts are: \n\n1) ask what kind, if any homemade gift they would like (making it explicit that if they would rather have something else, that's totally cool).\n\n2) ask if they have preferred styles/colors, or want me to wing it (and then desperately hope they give me something to go off of so I don't have to spend the entire time wondering if they will like it).\n\nAnd 3) if they don't like it, do my best not to have any hard feelings. I'm also okay with them choosing to donate if it just isn't quite for them. I'd rather that than have them store it away to never be seen again, use it begrudgingly, or have it become a source of derision like the poster talking about her SIL constantly insulting her gift.", "Baby boys wearing shirts that say \u201cLock up your daughters\u201d.", "That is the coolest thing ever.

Maybe the other clothing was more practical and she will dress baby in your special clothes at another point.

I don\u2019t think I put my baby in any of her special outfits for at least another 3 weeks. \nI get this was a tradition and you spent a lot of heartfelt time on the outfit.  I hear your disappointment that they put baby in some designer outfit. But the moment already happened, so what could you do to move forward?

I've crocheted so many blankets for babies and only once have i seen one pop up in a picture that the mom posted on social media.  I was so excited!   \n\nI so rarely see the items that i make after they leave, and i hope they are being used.  One of my former coworkers has a hat i made and he wears the fuck out of it in the cold weather.  He's the type to always take selfies and i'm still excited to see one with him wearing that hat.  \n\nUse it!  Just be gentle with the laundering and follow instructions for the fiber.  It should last a long time"]}
