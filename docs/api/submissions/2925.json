Even with their problems in the social domain, sensory issues, obsessions, etc., they are still living in greater society and must live within social boundaries. \n\nHis condition is only an explanation for his behavior, not an excuse. I believe that you could have handled his behavior better, but the results would have been the same. In the first instance a better response would have been, \u201cDon\u2019t do that. If you do it again, you\u2019re going to have to leave.\u201d If your brother was an NT and drunk, I expect you would have reacted much like this. \n\nAs time passes, he\u2019s going to have to live more independently and assume responsibility for his behavior.

Or does he do it to your parents and other people in his life as well? If he just does it to you that\u2019s a pretty big red flag and a perfectly understandable reason for you to request your parents to not bring him to your apartment anymore.

Anyone touching your body in a way you don't approve of is a red line that you should never give way on. Brother gets kicked out, brother shouldn't be allowed back.
