Well done on your quick thinking!\n\nYour roommate shouldn't have used your eggs without your permission and he shouldn't have planned to use them again without your permission. He also shouldn't be yelling at his gf for his own thwarted misdeeds. Perhaps going to the store will give him time to clear his head and think about all this a bit more sensibly.", "NTA. And I hope you reminded him to pick up two dozen since they still owe you from using the previous dozen you had in the fridge.  And I bet he tried to use one of your eggs and realized it was hard boiled, not that he saw your name on the package.", "NTA. Groceries are ridiculous so I don\u2019t blame you.", "NYA.

Even the 15 boxes are cheaper. Since its something you both use then surely it would make sense to share the burden of buying the eggs? Similarly with milk flour and condiments etc. Also fridge/cupboard space comes at premium in a shared house.\n\nIt would be better for both parties to share the burden as much as possible.

Do you each have to have your own cartons of eggs, cartons of milk, bags of flour, etc? Hope you have a big fridge for all the double items. And eggs are $6 a carton, that\u2019s $0.50 an egg each, that\u2019s still not crazy\u2026\n\nI think it\u2019s less stressful if you guys both loosely taking turns buying common items and share (eggs, butter, milk, condiments, etc), but don\u2019t keep strict score or make a thing of it. Sure, some months you may pay more or they may pay more, but the comfort and commodity is 100% worth it to me\n\n\nUnless you are in debt and REALLY hurting for $.50 an egg, then I do apologize and see your point and hope you make it through this tough time. \n\nAlso- I\u2019ve never used eggs for pancake mix, I always just use milk/water and mix haha it still works, pancake batter is thick enough you don\u2019t need an egg to bind it", "YTA for being so petulant over *eggs.* \ud83e\udd5a\n\n>\tI asked them **if they got stuff to make breakfast for themselves because I need eggs.**\n\nFrom what you said, it sounds like you weren\u2019t being straight up instead of just saying, \u201chey, eggs are expensive atm. do you mind buying your own separately?\u201d Don\u2019t ask about their breakfast. Be straight up.\n\nTo then boil ten eggs a **WEEK IN ADVANCE** of your lunch and then write your name on a carton (as if they don\u2019t know it\u2019s not theirs) is passive aggressive af. \n\nI\u2019d love to read their POV of you as a roommate \ud83d\ude2d\n\n**edit to those downvoting:** They didn\u2019t use the entire carton.

Have you explicitly told your roommate that you can't afford to share eggs?

If they still eat your eggs, they are def th AH.", "No I don\u2019t use any of their groceries", "They are in relationship, I think OP is not. She may end up with way less than half!", "I agree that butter, condiments and flour can be shared. But not eggs or milk. They use those items more than me and it turns into me buying their groceries for them. It doesn\u2019t make me comfortable to think I have enough eggs/milk to make something and finding out they used it all (multiple times).\n\nAlso interesting about eggs for pancake mix, it calls for it on the box so that\u2019s why I\u2019ve always used an egg", "Whether OP is in a tight spot or not, they're not obligated to buy their roommates anything. It's the roommates obligation to get their own supplies. It sounds like a  shared home so people should just use common sense buying items and not overstock and buy essentials. It'd be different if there was a prior agreement but it's not indicated and just rude of the roommate to use someone else supplies/groceries", "Ive been in this situation several times with roommates. Unless there is a specific agreement about sharing groceries, which was not specified here, then it is perfectly reasonable to be upset if a roommate is mooching off of supplies you purchased. Personally, if you need to borrow an egg or two, that shouldnt be a big deal, but if you take the last of them, you at least owe the courtesy of a notification and a replacement for what you took when you next go to the store.\n\nA loose agreement to take turns buying groceries? Ive done that, and got burned every time. Other roommates will be all \"Hey make sure you pick up X items,\" and expect me to cover it all, and when its their turn, its \"Oops, I forgot what you wanted.\" and they only get the bare minimum for their needs. Granted this is my personal experience, others may have had different, but I think its rather naive to think such an agreement will last long without somebody taking advantage... intentional or not.\n\nI just paid 12.99$ for eighteen pack carton of eggs. That will not last a week in my house. \n\nAnd if you like pancakes with no eggs in it, good for you. Two eggs in a standard batch of pancake batter has always been the norm for people I know, and on every recipe Ive seen.", "I agree. It\u2019s a tiny fridge and having two cartons of milk and two cartons of eggs is mad for two people living in the same place.", "You cut out where I said \u201cmy eggs\u201d. Also I boiled them 2 days ahead of time\ud83d\ude02 not a week lol. Plus, they always make breakfast on the weekends so that question was normal.

If you let them use your flour or sugar once and said nothing, that just means you are letting the groceries be shared. You not using theirs is not their decision, so they dont have to be bothered by it. \n\nEven a gentle pointer that eggs cannot be shared cos it's a bit expensive and you are trying to ration your use should be verbally spoken prior. If you have, then NTA. Else, I am not so inclined to say they should have known.", "They can buy the eggs 2/3 of the time then.\n\nI think it gets a bit petty when people start counting individual eggs but definitely if 3 people are using them them they should all contribute 1/3 of the cost or buy them 1 in every 3 times.", "Ok cool, glad it works for you and your roommate! Whatever works for you guys, go for it and best of luck", "That\u2019s true, depends on how close you are to them too.
