Ive done that, and got burned every time.

Comparing H-E-B in Texas (like Sainsbury) to Tesco in Scotland.", "Increased food prices has happened rather suddenly in the US and it is pretty shocking and worrying to Americans.  I think avian flu has made eggs particularly expensive.", "Back in my day, eggs & toilet paper were so inexpensive we would *throw* them at our enemies house!", "why would you assume that just because you do something once and someone doesn\u2019t say anything you can just continually do so. That\u2019s the logic of so many abusers.", "Nope...", "A lot of huge farms in the US also went up in flames, https://www.thepoultrysite.com/news/2022/12/more-than-500-000-us-farm-animals-died-in-barn-fires-in-2022\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-processing-fire/fact-check-food-processing-plant-fires-in-2022-are-not-part-of-a-conspiracy-to-trigger-u-s-food-shortages-idUSL2N2WW2CY", "My Costco doesn't have eggs, they've told me they just can't get them when I've asked when they will refill.", "Am sorry you feel thats entitlement, but I was raised in a more communal living. Things should be specified as private, else it's all for common use. We dont have hang ups about personal belongings as much, and those things considered personal were only in personal rooms or shelves and specified as such.", "If you do a little digging, you\u2019ll find that the biggest egg producer in the US raised it prices 138%. Gross profits jumped from $50.4 million to $535.3 million (26-week period, ending in November 21 compared to the same 26-week period in 2022). That\u2019s called price gouging, when you add in the fact that Cal-Maine is busy buying up the competition, I\u2019d say it\u2019s all about lining their pockets. Highest price I\u2019ve seen in my area is $8.99/dozen\u2026\u2026guess who owns the label.", "Yeah, FWIW I always buy expensive free range eggs and they\u2019ve only gone up a little. I just got a dozen from the bougie grocery store in my Midwest town for $5-something. Expensive, but they\u2019ve gone up less than $1.", "Egg producers said not bird flu but supermarket mark-up. \n\nFarmers receiving the same price for their product. \n\nRailway slowing trains leading to increased feed costs. \n\nGreedy corporate profiting asshats.", "Michigan US.  About $5 per dozen.  Sucks.  And we moved from Alabama where we had our own chickens!!!", "Only 5 to 6% of egg layers have been euthanized. Somehow, that resulted in 138% increase to profit for the largest egg distributor. It is unquestionably price gouging.", "I\u2019ve been having a hard time finding dandelion greens for my rabbit where I live. Right now food shortages seem to be very regional. I\u2019m lucky to live in an agricultural area in California and can buy fresh eggs if things start to get too bad. I used to be able to get them for free though. Before the avian flu epidemic most people around here would rather give away the extras than have them rot.", "See, that's a you problem. The default is that unless it is specified communal-KEEP YOUR FREAKING HANDS OFF.", "I live in a city that has the egg farm label that supplies the greater counties around me. That brand is $8/dozen at our local store, but they can charge 12-15$ by sending the eggs to further stores; so our local store hasn\u2019t had any in a couple weeks."]}
