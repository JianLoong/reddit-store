Also, she made a post online??? Time to comment about how your aunt was your cousins accomplice to try and steal her own sisters partner.", "NTA. Wednesday is obviously \u201cnot alone forever\u201d, as she\u2019s the one who brought a BF to Thanksgiving. Projection much? Your comment was absolutely perfect, I literally laughed reading it. She should know better than to flirt with her sisters BF. Sandy is messy, manipulative, and dramatic.", "NTA. The Adams Family were controversial in their time because the parents actually showed affection towards each other (gasp!) In your family, there\u2019s a very clear dynamic that Sandy is a golden child- you are seeing through the nonsense - lovable weirdos are way better than awful pretty people.", "NTA not even a little bit.  Sandy is manipulative and well - ugly on the inside.  Your aunt is judgmental and wrong to support her.  Well done you.  And how was Wednesday responsible?  For having a boyfriend Sandy would flirt with?  You, Wednesday and George are on solid ground.  Everyone else...sink hole", "NTA. Someone called her out for her trashy behaviour. It\u2019s not because she follows the latest trend that she\u2019s better than her sister. The fact that your aunt doesn\u2019t think her flirt with the bf is bad, is weird", "NTA- glad she has you on her side since her mother and sister are against her.", "NTA but also you are kinda an AH. A justifiable one tho. You came in hard. But, goodness gracious don\u2019t apologize to Sandy. I don\u2019t see a shared metal preference as a reason to be together, but \u201cyou\u2019ll be alone forever\u201d going into \u201cflirt with your boyfriend\u201d is an extra level of awful. Sandy is the worst and aunt is, at best, not great.\n\nETA: by \u201cyou are kinda an AH\u201d I mean it in the best possible way. You did good and are a good friend.", "NTA  \n\n\nWell, well, well if it isn't a spoiled Golden Child and their enabler back on the scene. I'm guessing your aunt favors Sandy over Wednesday a lot. \n\nYou're a good person to stop Sandy from making George uncomfortable and a good cousin for cutting off Wednesday's toxic sister.", "NTA - your aunt is showing obvious favouritism to Sandy (the Grease Adams family references are killing me!) - she's made it acceptable for Sandy to sexually harrass her sisters boyfriend- I think Sandy might be starting to realise her sister is having more success in the love department with her goth looks and is doubling down because she's used to being the centre if attention.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSandy is a bully, I'm wondering how she were at school if that's how she's acting towards her own sister.", "NTA, enjoy thanksgiving without those two", "My lord, NTA! Sandy needs to go fuck  off all the way", "NTA!! Your aunt and your cousins are asshole for being OK with flirting with taken men. You did good kid!", "NTA - Sandy was trying to one-up Wednesday by taking her bf, who was obviously uncomfortable in the situation, didn't read the room, and was generally being TAH.

It was technically none of your business to chip in, George should have resolved it himself. \n\nNo need to explain why Sandy is an AH, because she is.", "Oh yes please do it!", "Because how dare Wednesday find someone that likes (maybe love her, he got her a promise ring and he lights up when he sees her)", "I don't know. \n\nSandy went to a private school and Wednesday got into a student exchange program in London (no wonder why she's happier over there)", "Not really, they were not strangers in a public place where everybody would mind their own business.

Are you saying we shouldn't stand up against sexual harassment? We should mind our own business when a family member is sexually harassing a guest?\n\nJust because he's a man doesn't mean he should have to resolve it himself.
