{"id": 1766, "submission_id": "yp90ij", "title": "AITA for leaving my baby shower early and \"causing a scene\"?", "selftext": "TA account \n\nMy (32F) husband of 7 years (32M) and I are pregnant. We have one previous child, Anne (6F, fake name) who has epilepsy. She has had 1 seizure before (relevant later in the story).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo be honest, my MIL is horrible. She gives backhanded compliments, insults me and my looks and always tries to set my husband up with other people. The last time we went to her place she said she could make my husband a tinder account, or set him up with some girl who is the daughter of MILs best friend. My husband has told her to stop, but doesn't do anything else. News flash, she doesn't stop. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen sending invites to my baby shower, I told my husband I didn't want my MIL there. He told me, \"since you're not letting my own mother be in the room with you when you're giving birth, you have to invite her to this. You should be grateful that you get a baby shower at all\". Also, he wouldn't even be at the baby shower, as he has something at work. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the baby shower, I was telling everyone how our baby was once again a girl. My MIL then decided to say, \"Wow another girl! Let's hope she's not like her sister\". I asked what she meant by that and she said, \"we don't need any other diseases in the family. Imagine seeing a new-born baby drop to the floor and shake everywhere. It's embarrassing\". At first I was honestly confused as she clearly had 0 idea what she was talking about. But then the pregnancy hormones really kicked in and I started crying hysterically. I left my friends house and my mother drove me home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce I got home I saw my husband there. I didn't know why he was home and not at work but I just didn't stop crying. He said, \"where are all the gifts? You do realise how expensive some baby things can be\". I honestly couldn't believe he said that of all things so I decided to lock myself in our bedroom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout 10 mins later he tells me he got a text from his mother explaining what happened. He told me that I \"caused a scene\" and \"should be happy I got to meet up with some friends today\". I tried explaining how wrong what she said was and how she insulted our daughter and UNBORN baby. He said \"well Anne's epilepsy medication isn't cheap so I see why she said what she said. You just interpreted it wrong. Apologise to my mother.\" I packed a bag and called my mother to pick me up. I'm currently at her place and she's picking Anne up from school.\n\nMy husband and his family keep blowing up my phone and calling me a \"drama queen\" along with other hateful names so I need to ask, AITA?\n\nEdit: WOW this blew up. I woke up to 700 new notifications so thank you all for your feedback. Just wanted to let y\u2019all know that I am meeting up with my husband later today and we will discuss things. I *will* be showing him this posts and your comments. Also, thank you all for the kind messages and the awards too! However I don\u2019t know what they do lol. Can someone please explain them to me? Thanks. See you soon.\n\nUPDATE: ok so I\u2019d like to start by explaining my username. My friend (who hosted the baby shower) suggested the name as a joke. When I showed her the kind things y\u2019all said I also asked, \u201cwhy do people think I\u2019m suicidal?\u201d. So I\u2019d just like to say I\u2019m not and my friend apologised if we worried any of y\u2019all. Ok now to what happened\n\nAll of you were talking about how abusive my husband is. I guess I never realised it was abuse just because it wasn\u2019t physical. I don\u2019t know why I had that mindset, but I did. \n\nI sat him down and started reading. \n\u201cYou\u2019re MIL is horrible\u201d\n\u201cDivorce this man\u201d\n\u201cAnne doesn\u2019t deserve this\u201d etc. \n\nI explained to him that I wanted a divorce. We were in a public cafe so I knew there was no way he\u2019d physically hurt me. This was how the conversation went after I said I wanted a divorce:\nHusband: \u201cSo just because a few strangers on the internet told you to do something, you\u2019re going to do it?\u201d\nMe: \u201cit\u2019s not \u2018a few\u2019, it\u2019s thousands.\u201d\nHusband: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who it is, you don\u2019t even know them\u201d\nMe: \u201cWell you don\u2019t know the chefs in restaurants yet you trust them to cook your food\u201d\nHusband: \u201cShut the fuck up\u201d\nMe: \u201cit\u2019s not my fault all you do is run to mommy and choose her over your daughter\u201d\nHusband: \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck about you or your opinion you fucking bitch\u201d\nMe: \u201cha ok\u201d\n\nAfter that he stormed out of the cafe.\n\nI think y\u2019all would be glad to know that I emptied our joint bank accounts and took any valuables. \n\nY\u2019all might think \u201coh that\u2019s a happy ending to the story\u201d but there\u2019s way more. \n\nSo my FIL contacted me (which is weird we only talk at family gatherings and what not) and told me he apologises on behalf of his wife\u2019s actions. He told me that she never liked me because I \u201cstole him away\u201d from someone called Melissa?Apparently my husband and her were together during college but she cheated on him. MIL however still loved her like a daughter. Turns out, all these years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s been cheating on me with Melissa. MIL knew. FIL knew. Everyone knew. It explains a lot, like why he wasn\u2019t at work that day. What actually happened was Melissa came over to our house and they had sex IN MY OWN BED. I was disgusted hearing it. I\u2019m not sure how but she must\u2019ve left before I came home. So basically Melissa told MIL and MIL told FIL. FIL said he regretted not telling me sooner and kept apologising over and over again. I was shocked and started crying. I thanked him for telling me and said I just needed some space. \n\nHowever he also told me that MIL was telling a different story to what happened on that day (none of my soon to be ex husbands family was there so they didn\u2019t know what happened) and that\u2019s why everyone was telling ME to apologise to MIL. MIL told them that I started yelling at her for \u201cwearing a better dress than me on my special day\u201d and I \u201cthrew drinks and food on her\u201d. (She made a mess of her dress previously so I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s what she used as \u2018evidence\u2019 lol). FIL said, \u201cthe woman really loves herself. In a couple of days I can guarantee you we\u2019ll have *another* picture of herself hanging in our living room\u201d. I laughed and said goodbye. I\u2019ve also gotten a lawyer to sort out some divorce stuff. \n\nI\u2019ll give y\u2019all another update soon. \u2764\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1667875624, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yp90ij/aita_for_leaving_my_baby_shower_early_and_causing/", "score": 7661, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that it would be better if there was no disease doesn\u2019t change the fact that your MIL said something incredibly rude and your husband doesn\u2019t catch it.\n\nFrankly I\u2019d let your MIL make him a tinder account at this point. Stay with your mom.", "Document everything", "Obviously everybody would prefer a baby not to have a serious medical condition, for the baby's sake. Any decent human isn't gonna wish medical hardship on an unborn child. That doesn't give your MIL leave to be an absolute shrew about it and denigrate your other child as somehow less-than for having a condition that's in no way her fault.", "Love get thee into individual therapy asap!  You've normalized emotional abuse......it ain't normal.  No loving husband would treat their wife the way your husband treats you and allows you to be treated.\n\nHopefully you'll get to a point where you recognize that you deserve better.", "Please don't subject your daughters to being anywhere near this toxic cow, or her horrible son.\nBy your own description, he mistreats you, his mom mistreats you AND your daughter; if your two girls are raised in that family, then you risk both your children being mentally and emotionally abused by those two, not just the one that already is. \nI think you know that deep down.", "Obviously no one *wants* their child to have an illness. That is not what your MIL said though. If you want to give your husband the benefit of the doubt, go ahead and tell him again what his mother said and tell him to listen to what she *said* not to *what he thinks she meant*. \n\nShe has no concern for the babies\u2019 health and well-being. She\u2019s *embarrassed*. Can you imagine being *embarrassed* by your grandchild\u2019s illness? \n\nIf he still decides to side with MIL on this you have a bigger husband problem than you have a MIL problem. \n\nPS: she has no right to be in the room when you give birth and don\u2019t let anyone guilt trip you about this!", "Of course, it would be good if she didn\u2019t have epilepsy. As an epileptic myself, I would love not to have this condition. But it doesn\u2019t make your daughter less then. So his defense of his mother makes no sense whatsoever.", "Your husband is a cowardly dipshit, who is abusing you through his AH mother.", "Drop him like he\u2019s hot and slap him with divorce papers. You and your girls deserve better.", "You\u2019re in an abusive relationship. Leave for yourself and the sake of the kids", "Of course it would be good if she didn\u2019t have epilepsy. I don\u2019t think anyone wants this poor child to suffer with that. He\u2019s just making excuses for his demonic mother.", "A man who values more about expensive baby gifts than his horrible mother saying those things is still the ah.  Gather all important documents for you and your daughter and stay with your mother.  Do not allow DH or MIL at the hospital.  In fact, I'd call the hospital ahead and tell them to revoke DH's medical power and to not tell people that you are a patient there when giving birth.  The only person who has to be in the room is you and the baby you are birthing.", "Can we go back to the friends thing for a second though? You do have regular opportunities to hang out with your friends without his approval, don't you??", "Hon, if my mom had the audacity to call my (pretend) child with epilepsy *diseased*, I'd rip her apart. Has he called your mother out at all for such despicable behavior?", "Does he agree with the \"embarrassing\" part? What an awful woman.", "hello, i am a sex worker.\n\nmy CLIENTS treat me better than your HUSBAND.  i wouldn't even let that man through my door.\n\ni hope you make it out.", "He probably changed his tune cause he realized what an AH he was being by agreeing, he didn\u2019t want to look like the bad guy and probably was thinking it but didn\u2019t say it.", "I have a kid with a very mild disability, sure it would be great if she didn't have to deal with that, but I love her just as she is, she might be a different kid without it. He's back tracking and you know it.", "I have epilepsy, o have since I was a little girl. I have heard comments similarly to what your MIL and husband said my entire life, and at one point I had convinced myself I was such a burden and was better off unalive because of those comments. I highly recommend those are never said around your daughter or that someone is talking to her about the fact it's not her fault.", "Did you find out why he was home instead of at work? That's another thing to be concerned with. He sucks. His mom sucks. Stay with your mom as long as you can, if not forever.", "omg yes, this! I can't believe i forgot to add that. must have been so horrified at the idea my brain went NOPE lol", "this was what shocked me right at the beginning.\nwas gonna ask if anyone considers this normal.\nglad someone said it and I'm not the weirdo!\n\nNTA!", "You must be a saint to not have smacked her yet...NTA", "My mom stayed in a similar situation you are in. I love her dearly, but I can't forgive her and I don't think I ever will. It scared me for life.", "NTA.  Your husband and his family sound horrible.    YOU are the one giving birth. No one has a right to be in the delivery room.  \n\nAnyone that is in the delivery room is there to support you - and that includes your husband.   If he isn\u2019t supporting you, have the nurses kick him out.   \n\nBirth isn\u2019t a spectator sport, so any comments from your husband about MIL being in the delivery room need to be shut down.   He doesn\u2019t get to be in there if you don\u2019t want him there. \n\nYou do have a MIL problem, but you have a much bigger husband problem.", "We're not talking about the red flags from your MIL, it's the marinara your Husband is throwing all around the room.", "Why the fuck was your husband  home during your baby shower btw", "Regardless of what your MIL does or says, your husband is the real problem. What a complete and total AH he is! His lack of support for you, lack of respect and empathy, lack of everything really, is the true problem. Why are you married to such a complete jerk??? You may want to take a good, long look at this relationship. He obviously isn\u2019t even going to attempt to change if you keep putting up with his crap.", "You have a husband problem - NOT A MIL PROBLEM. Wake UP.", "Yes!  I read it in a book a donkey\u2019s age ago and it fits so many situations lol!", "Yes this so much. Your daughters may choose men similar to your husband if you let them see 'its okay' because you stay with him. I can't imagine you would want your daughters to be treated this way when they grow up.", "The unfortunate thing though is that if they divorce, she'll have to send her kids to stay with him, and he seems exactly like the kind of guy who will have his MIL take care of the kids when it is his time with his children.\n\nWomen need to know that a partner's toxic family can be just as troublesome as a toxic partner, and if you split up, your child will be subjected to them for the rest of their childhood without you there to intervene when they are being treated poorly.", "MiL doesn't respect her son, either. The only point in his favor is telling his mom to stop trying to set him up with other women (point for bare minimum, but still), but she won't stop until he's with a prop SHE likes better. Extra gross.", "Yes \ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. This is what I did to my mom. It was bad. Thx for pointing this out. This, I think, hurt my mom even more than the direct abuse from my dad. Her own kid turning on her. Terrible.", "This is why my friend is NC with her daughter... her verminous abusive husband groomed the daughter to crap all over her mother, the same way he did. So they BOTH were horrible to my friend.", "Bring a police escort too!!! Sorry to chime in!!! But male friends might make the situation worse. Get a lawyer and pull those texts from his phone, and get affidavits from EVERYONE there!!! Then document estimated times she\u2019s tried to set your husband up! That\u2019s NOT ok to say that about a child!!!! Ugh Humans. I swear!!! Worst species on the planet!!! Where do these people come from?", "You hit ALL the bullseyes!", "Yes, that sounds familiar. Thank you for rescuing my poor foggy brain!", "Let nurses and Drs know beforehand who you want and don't want into room when you are having your baby.", "Awful Husband and mil. When I was with 1st husband I had to get away from him.  My parents lived in another country for work. I went to stay with mil and fil.  They told me if it came to be a choice between him and me, they were on my side.  That is the type of inlaws you need.", "So glad to read your updates!! I\u2019m also glad to read that you\u2019ve got a potential ally in FIL. Great job preparing yourself by bringing valuables and documents with you. Stay strong, collect as much evidence against that abusive prick as you can and keep your precious babies away from him!", "NTA and your husband sounds like a weak father figure. If he's not willing to go to bat for his daughter that is already a part of his life, he seriously can't be trusted with this new one. Poor mother-in-law is hateful and the fact that your husband thinks what she does and says is okay, is probably indicative of the fact that he is an unsuitable mate. If he was home before you, that is also really suspicious. Good luck", "NTA. Your MIL is an ableist AH and your husband is an enabling AH. No decent man would allow *anyone*- especially not his own mother- to insult his family like that. \n\nYour husband can be a husband and a man and stand up for you, your children and hold your MIL accountable, or he can be a mama's boy and let her mistreat you, which will result in him being shipped back to his mother if she wants to take care of him.", "Wow just..... wow sorry but please leave this man immediately he sounds like absolute garbage and abusive. What kind of man can't even stand up for his own family. His mother sounds horrible too I honestly don't know how you put up with them for 7 years. You absolutely do not need to put up with this kind of disrespect from either of them. \n\nBig NTA", "NTA\n\nI am telling you this as someone who left an emotionally abusive marriage decades ago.\n\nIt is terrifying on every level. You will feel guilty because you are breaking up your kids family. You will be shamed, cussed, driven into the ground on every level.\n\nYou will come out the other side of this a kick ass woman who knows she and her girls deserve better.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband is the first person that will teach your daughters what to tolerate from men. Do you want your daughters being treated like that? \n\nThat's exactly what will happen if nothing changes. \n\nYou don't need this kind of stress while pregnant. Hope everything works out", "If MY mother had said that to MY wife about MY child, I'm not sure I would have been able to stop myself from punching her in the face. \n\nSomeone definitely caused a scene...and it ain't you.\n\nRather miraculous that you're pregnant at all, since your husband clearly has no balls.\n\nYour husband is a loser and your MIL is a hag. Get out while you still have some dignity--make it a story you tell your friends over mimosas in 10 years about how you can't believe how much better your life is and how long you put up with it.\n\nNTA, NTA, all day.", "NTA. Your husband is a mentally abusive asshole a d your MIL is a shit human. Run as fast as you can and never look back. He's not going to get better and she's only going to treat you worse as time goes on.", "NTA hate to be that jump straight to divorce guy but......", "NTA. I'm not sure who's the bigger asshole between your husband and mil, but that apple sure didn't fall far from the tree.", "Get Out!!!! You are absolutely NTA. Don\u2019t dare feel down. Your MIL was absolutely wrong for saying what she said. And your horrible husband is disgusting for not putting his foot down and protecting his child. You were not a drama queen by any means. Nobody should stay somewhere where they feel attacked like that. Also let\u2019s no brush why he was home and not at work. If he got off early why wasn\u2019t he at the baby shower?", "The update guys ! \nEven casual looking stuff can have deep reasons \ud83e\udd79", "Wow those are beautiful in-laws", "Thank you!!", "I\u2019m so glad to see your updates and that you\u2019re leaving him.  Please also consider therapy to help you work through all the gaslighting and emotional abuse he and his family have put you through!", "THAT MAN IS EVIL! Girllllll if it wasnt for that baby shower you would never have known. F MELISSA AND THAT MIL. You are worthy of love and deserve it. You did not do anything to warrant this level of cruelty. He stole 7+ years of your life when he could have just been with Melissa this whole time. Im so angry rn! I should not be this involved but I\u2019m all in. I pray God brings you peace. They wont even get joint custody, your kids are better off without an abusive father and evil vile grandma. Babeee I am giving you THE BIGGEST VIRTUAL HUG! I wish I knew you cause girl I would ride out on their asses with and for you!", "Personally I wouldn't even put the bastard on the new baby's birth certificate. And only supervised visitation. And file for full custody of both kids. He doesn't deserve to be in either child's life", "Yes they were.", "Luckily he will keep getting cheated on by Melissa the same way he did in college! And your knight is otw! He will protect Anne and new baby. I just know it! You deserve so much I\u2019m praying and hoping it comes swiftly. They are all disgusting", "Remind me! 5 days", "It needs to be OP or MIL. He has to choose. So far, he's leaning toward MIL.", "Not gonna lie, I\u2019ve always looked down on therapy but maybe I\u2019ll give it a try"]}
