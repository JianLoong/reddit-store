Imagine seeing a new-born baby drop to the floor and shake everywhere. It's embarrassing\". At first I was honestly confused as she clearly had 0 idea what she was talking about.

I didn't know why he was home and not at work but I just didn't stop crying. He said, \"where are all the gifts? You do realise how expensive some baby things can be\". I honestly couldn't believe he said that of all things so I decided to lock myself in our bedroom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout 10 mins later he tells me he got a text from his mother explaining what happened. He told me that I \"caused a scene\" and \"should be happy I got to meet up with some friends today\".
