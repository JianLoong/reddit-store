Imagine seeing a new-born baby drop to the floor and shake everywhere. It's embarrassing\". At first I was honestly confused as she clearly had 0 idea what she was talking about.

I didn't know why he was home and not at work but I just didn't stop crying. He said, \"where are all the gifts? You do realise how expensive some baby things can be\". I honestly couldn't believe he said that of all things so I decided to lock myself in our bedroom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout 10 mins later he tells me he got a text from his mother explaining what happened. He told me that I \"caused a scene\" and \"should be happy I got to meet up with some friends today\".

Your MIL and husband are monsters!\u201cEmbarrassing\u201d to see a baby have a seizure?! Scolding his sobbing, pregnant wife for being upset and not bringing the presents? These people are disgusting. \n\nYou did not \u201ccause a scene\u201d and you are NTA.  Your reaction was totally understandable, I just wish your friends had booted that b**** so you could have stayed and enjoyed your shower.  Good on you for going to stay with your mother.

Build your case against allowing her any access to either child and preventing their father from using them as weapons.", "OP, I know this is going to be downvoted to hell, but you can't diagnose epilepsy after one seizure.
