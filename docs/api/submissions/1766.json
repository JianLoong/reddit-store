We have one previous child, Anne (6F, fake name) who has epilepsy. She has had 1 seizure before (relevant later in the story).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo be honest, my MIL is horrible. She gives backhanded compliments, insults me and my looks and always tries to set my husband up with other people. The last time we went to her place she said she could make my husband a tinder account, or set him up with some girl who is the daughter of MILs best friend. My husband has told her to stop, but doesn't do anything else. News flash, she doesn't stop. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen sending invites to my baby shower, I told my husband I didn't want my MIL there. He told me, \"since you're not letting my own mother be in the room with you when you're giving birth, you have to invite her to this. You should be grateful that you get a baby shower at all\". Also, he wouldn't even be at the baby shower, as he has something at work. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the baby shower, I was telling everyone how our baby was once again a girl. My MIL then decided to say, \"Wow another girl! Let's hope she's not like her sister\". I asked what she meant by that and she said, \"we don't need any other diseases in the family. Imagine seeing a new-born baby drop to the floor and shake everywhere. It's embarrassing\". At first I was honestly confused as she clearly had 0 idea what she was talking about. But then the pregnancy hormones really kicked in and I started crying hysterically. I left my friends house and my mother drove me home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce I got home I saw my husband there. I didn't know why he was home and not at work but I just didn't stop crying. He said, \"where are all the gifts? You do realise how expensive some baby things can be\". I honestly couldn't believe he said that of all things so I decided to lock myself in our bedroom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout 10 mins later he tells me he got a text from his mother explaining what happened. He told me that I \"caused a scene\" and \"should be happy I got to meet up with some friends today\". I tried explaining how wrong what she said was and how she insulted our daughter and UNBORN baby. He said \"well Anne's epilepsy medication isn't cheap so I see why she said what she said. You just interpreted it wrong. Apologise to my mother.\" I packed a bag and called my mother to pick me up. I'm currently at her place and she's picking Anne up from school.\n\nMy husband and his family keep blowing up my phone and calling me a \"drama queen\" along with other hateful names so I need to ask, AITA?", "created_utc": 1667875624, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yp90ij/aita_for_leaving_my_baby_shower_early_and_causing/", "score": 188, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
