When my parents moved to America John and his wife moved with, they now live about 5 hours from us but they come visit every couple of months. My mom goes to visit John and his wife because she got a job in the same hospital as his wife. \n\nThis weekend John and his wife came to visit us for a few days. Everything went smoothly, my cousin came over with a couple of his friends and we sat by the pool and talked while John was inside watching a car show. The time came for everyone to leave and my parents went to sleep and Johns wife went to sleep. \n\nI was upstairs in my room watching tv but I decided to go downstairs to grab something to eat and when I came down John was laying on the couch. I asked why he wasn\u2019t in bed and he said that he was too lazy to get up and go to bed. I turned the tv off for him and grabbed my food and started to walk back to my room but while I was walking back he asked to see my nails because I just did them. \n\nI went over and showed him my nails and he asked for a hug and kiss goodnight. I leaned down and turned my face away from him and gave him a hug. He kissed my neck and turned my head and kissed me on the lips. I tried to pull away but he put his hand on the back of my head and pulled me down and started kissing me with tongue while slipping his hand between my legs. I stood up quickly, said goodnight and ran up to my room. I started crying and told my mom. \n\nThe next day I called my therapist and told her what happened and she said she would have to file a police report. The police came by our house and asked a few questions before they left. That night my parents sat me down and explained that I had just ruined Johns life and possibly their friendship with them. (John is a teacher by the way) My mom said that he will never be able to teach again and that I will have ruined his teaching carreer.

You did exactly the right thing. Him not being able to teach is a good thing what if he did that to others?", "NTA - Your parents are not adequately protecting you from an actual sexual predator.

It\u2018s all completely his fault. \n\nMaybe your therapist can talk to them and explain to them why the situation was absolutely wrong and that you\u2018re a victim. \n\nobviously NTA", "Oh OP!!! Absolutely NTA\n\nThat man is a predator and I\u2019m so sorry you had to be the one he targeted \n\nHow dare your parents put the guilt trip on you!!!

It\u2019s inappropriate.", "NTA Absolutely in no way are you in the wrong. You are a child, he is an adult. He is a teacher he knows better and he is the one who decided to ruin his teaching career.", ">That night my parents sat me down and explained that I had just ruined Johns life and possibly their friendship with them. (John is a teacher by the way) My mom said that he will never be able to teach again and that I will have ruined his teaching carreer.\n\nGOOD! He shouldn't be around kids. If he's willing to sexually assault his friends' SIXTEEN YEAR OLD daughter, you KNOW he's done it to students. Your parents need to get their priorities straight. Ask them if they are really putting the career of a predator above their daughter's right not to be assaulted in her own home. NTA, but your parents are definitely assholes if they don't wake up. And if they don't? Ask yourself if this is how they always act and if you need that in your life. They should be proud of you! I sure am. You may have saved countless others from similar treatment.", "NTA. John assaulted a child. He ruined his own life. Your parents need to be parents and protect you.", "NTA! You did not do anything wrong, and this is not your fault. You did a good thing by telling your therapist, well done!\n\nHe lost his job because of his disgusting actions, which is his fault only. Not yours, not anyone's. You reporting his actions prevented him from causing the same abuse from happening to his other students, you may have even motivated a few plausible victims to come forward too. So no, you are NTA nor is it your fault.\n\nI suggest talking to your therapist about any confliction that you have, maybe ask for any support groups to attend (so that you can understand more from those in the same position as you)", "NTA - You did nothing wrong, and you're 16 years old. This creep is a predator and set you up from the start by  staying up.\n\nIf I were your father. I would whip this mf'er with my belt until he pissed his pants. \n\nThen, I'd call the sheriff to report what he did. If I caught a case for giving him some belt help, whatever.  \n\nI don't understand why your parents aren't upset at this person for doing this? That's not normal. You should work on being self-sufficient as soon as you turn 18.", "No, your parents absolutely are though. Totally and completely off the rails AHs. How DARE they?!?", "NTA. Also talk to your parents and therapist about this.", "NTA.  You didn't ruin anything. HE ruined it.", "NTA and I am so, so sorry!  I hope your parents come to their senses and defend you, protect you, and take care of you.  He is a predator and ruined his own life by doing something wildly inappropriate and illegal.", "Nta", "NTA. NTA. NTA.\n\nYou are the victim. And your parents are further victimizing you with their bullshit. Make it clear to them that you were sexually assaulted, and all they are doing is making it so you never have a good relationship with them again because they couldn't be bothered to support you when you were victimized. \n\nI am so disgusted by your parents.", "Oh hell no. NTA. He deserves whatever he gets and your parents should be ashamed of themselves.", "So you were assaulted and your parents are trying to make you feel guilty?

He had assaulted several other kids in the class. He SHOULD not be able to teach anymore. You DIDn't misunderstand anything. You're idiotic parents should be supporting you and not their friend who attacked their daughter. \n\nMaybe it was my age, but I remember blaming myself as a kid for a long time. Don't do that. You are not misunderstanding things. He ruined his friendship with your parents by attacking their daughter. If you don't realize this yet THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT!!!  Sorry but I'm so mad I want to hit something. This guy is a monster. Just because he seemed nice doesn't change that. My teacher was well liked by parents. Seemed like a great guy. Hard lesson for me to learn that monsters don't look like monsters. \\*hugs and healing to you", "None of what happened is your fault. Your parents are AHs. He made a choice to assault you, this is his consequence. Also, I promise you this is not the first time he does something like that. Thank you for reporting him, you saved countless lives.", "> That night my parents sat me down and explained that I had just ruined Johns life\n\nYour parents are just awful and I'm so, so sorry for you. John ruined his **own** life by committing sexual assault. The end.\n\nMake sure you get the counseling and therapy you need.", "Exactly! I hope it is just the shock of the news and that they came to their senses soon!", "Feel free to provide them with  graphic details.  Their job as parents is to protect YOU. Not their friend, his job, their friendship or themselves.  YOU should be their primary concern.", "Personally, You did the right thing, and I wouldn't trust my parents if they didn't take my side.\n\nSome life advice.... every job you have, be on time every day, keep your mouth shut, your hands busy, and never complain. Learn it, be the best, and make a goal to get a promotion every 2 or 3 years until you're comfortable. This advice has worked for 4 generations. Even if it means you have to jump companies/fields. If you want to make 100k a year, you need to work with ppl that make that or more. If you want free college and free healthcare, join the military for 2 years. That alone will save you 10s of thousands in your lifetime. \n\nWhen you make it, always remember what your parents did in that situation. They could be grandparents someday.", "Thank you so much. I really appreciate you sharing that with me, it really helps", "I will thank you", "Me too", "I\u2019ll remember this advice, maybe even make a poster for my room out of it. Thank you so much. I\u2019ll definitely keep this incident in mind if I ever decide to have kids", "Yes, not only did you not ruin John's life, you have likely saved other people from being assaulted by him. You have protected, not ruined.", "Please know that if that ever happens again, you are well within your right to fight back - bite anything put in your mouth, hit (with all your might!) back aiming for the eyes/groin. Scratch into their skin, pull out their hair, scream into their ears.", "I thought about that after but while it was happening all I wanted to do was get out of there. It took me a few moments to realize what was actually going on"]}
