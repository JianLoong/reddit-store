It's understandable that you don't want to be in a situation where you feel neglected and treated unfairly. Your dad's response to your concerns was dismissive and unsympathetic, and it's not fair for him to expect you to just \"deal with it\" when you've tried to address the issue multiple times. It's good that you've communicated your boundaries and are taking care of yourself by removing yourself from a situation that is causing you stress and discomfort. It's important for families to be supportive of each other, but that doesn't mean that you have to tolerate mistreatment or neglect.", "NTA. I have seen this exact situation before in where the child (you) was forced to accept the dads new wife and children, told to treat those children as your siblings, only for then a few years later to have the dad split up with the new wife and so the child (you) then having to basically forget those people ever existed! \n\nAsking your dad to have one on one time with him was perfectly reasonable and also very mature of you, to have him then dismiss and reject your request was unfair and unwarranted, I am sorry too as I can imagine the courage that would have taken, but you should be very proud of yourself for giving him that option before going low contact. \n\nYour dad needs to remember that you will be his family forever, that will NEVER change, however,his new wife and her daughter may not.", "NTA, He should've told that to his daughter instead. You made a good decision there, I'm so sorry that happened to you", "Nta, your father is way off base here.  Unless it is mandated by the court,  stay with your mom where you are cared for.  God bless you!", "NTA, your father should be spending time with you and feeding you when you're hungry. Just because a 10 year old isn't hungry shouldn't decide on whether you get to eat or not. Your dad is putting his gf's daughter over you. I don't blame you for not wanting to 'play family' with his gf and her child. When he wants you to come back over again, just tell him that you'll stay where your meals don't revolve around a 10 year old.", "You sound mature for 17. I think maybe this will give your dad some time to reflect perhaps if you really feel like you\u2019ve told him what the issues were and why you now are going to not be coming over. If he can make the actual effort for those changes within the new \u201cfamily\u201d dynamic to be consistent then things could change. \n\nAlso- not sure how long you\u2019ve known his wife and her daughter, but don\u2019t feel like you have to feel obligated to them or they are now your \u201cfamily\u201d- your dad doesn\u2019t have the right to push that on you. It\u2019s actually really weird he would do that, esp at your age when your basically a legal adult.", "NTA! Of course you did the right thing.", "This is his problem, not yours.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You're 17. Old enough to decide whom you spend time with. If your dad and his family are not treating you well, then you should not feel guilty for not spending time with them.

You shouldn\u2019t be the one having to make concessions to his new family.", "NTA - your father's main concern is keeping this woman happy because he wants what that relationship offers him.\n\nHe isn't willing to negotatie with this woman to ensure you are treated fairly becuase that isn't a priority for him.  When you say something that she doesnt' agree with that creates drama in his life and the fastest way for him to deal with what you say is to tell you that you are the problem\n\nYou took the best course of action for you.  If you were hungry, you couldn't make a sandwich? bowl of cereal? meal for yourself? or were you prevented from accessing food in the kitchen?", "\"He just told me to deal with it\" so I dealt with it by refusing to go and see him. BOOM!!!\n\nA foul and horrible position to be in. I cannot imagine your distress at being treated so shabbily by your own father. At least he has, finally perhaps, shown you who he really is. Without prying for details, which is no-one's business, his attitude and behaviour may be the reason your parents separated.\n\nAs miserable as it is, I think you have dealt with the situation wisely. It must feel bad to go LC with him but for your own wellbeing, it is probably the best course of action. \n\nThank goodness you seem to have a mum who treats you with love, kindness, decency and respect.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Hard to take an entire weekend off at a hotel for visitation. Completely understand you going low contact, though. If he isn't going to intervene, then he will be adjusting to not being a priority.", "Yea this is what it is at his house, we\u2019re only allowed to eat as a family and snacks you have to ask permission for.", "I suspect that comment about accepting the new family situation was in response to OP wanting to have time with just him. He doesn't want to take the time to deal with two families, so suck it up and make his life easy, apparently all the way around as he also doesn't want to deal with the 10 year old or her mother.", "I would have agreed with you if not for [OP's comment here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11oz5md/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_my_dads_house/jbve188?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) So they are literally *not allowed* to eat when they're hungry! Enforcing that on a 17 year old is way out of line, it's not comparable to, say, not letting an 8 year old have cookies before dinner.", "Regardless of his dad wanting time invested with them \u2014 he still has an obligation to feed his child - no matter if no one else is eating in the house"]}
