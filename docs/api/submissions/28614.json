{"id": 28614, "submission_id": "1749emd", "title": "AITA For \"being mean\" to my little cousin by telling her that she is a terrible pet owner?", "selftext": "17F here. My friend 16F \"Lily\" bought a hamster who turned out to be pregnant. The baby hamsters are going to be old enough to leave the mom in a week, so before that, I've been helping to tell as many people as possible to make sure the babies get adopted.\n\nMy cousin 14F \"Chloe\" found out and has been begging me to give her one of the baby hamsters because she really wants one and promises to take care of it.\n\nLike I said in the title though, Chloe is a terrible pet owner. Chloe's the one who begged my Aunt \"Kimberly\" for the pets they have right now (a cat, a betta fish, and a goldfish) but never takes care of them.\n\nThey got both of the fish from a carnival. Aunt Kimberly wanted to give the fish to someone else but Chloe begged her to keep them and promised she would take care of them. Chloe took care of them at first but after a few months she pretty much got bored of them and now Aunt Kimberly basically does all the work.\n\nBefore that, Chloe begged for a cat. Aunt Kimberly says she has to remind Chloe twice a day to feed the cat and refill its water bowl. Chloe admits to me that if Aunt Kimberly grounds her for something, she won't clean the cat's litter because she's mad at her mom. So the cat is stuck stepping on its poop until Aunt Kimberly notices and forces Chloe to clean it while hovering over her.\n\nAunt Kimberly obviously told Chloe that she couldn't have one of Lily's baby hamsters and said it was because they couldn't afford one. Chloe kept telling me how she knows her mom is lying about not being able to afford a hamster because Aunt Kimberly and her husband went somewhere nice recently and basically that her mom is a jerk because Chloe promised to take care of the hamster.\n\nI told Chloe that, no offense, but I don't think she should have a hamster either. She's a terrible pet owner to the pets she has now and never takes care of them even though she promised to when she first got them. Why should she get a new pet that's honestly more work than a cat or fish?\n\nChloe apparently told Aunt Kimberly about it. Aunt Kimberly told me that she knows I was sticking up for her, but calling Chloe a terrible pet owner was \"mean\" and she was trying not to make Chloe feel bad about herself.\n\nLily agreed that Chloe wouldn't have been a good hamster owner. But Lily also told me that I could have just repeated Aunt Kimberly's excuse of not being able to afford it. Lily said it was a bit mean because Chloe does have ADHD, so her maturity is lower than other kids her age and she's naturally more forgetful.\n\nI also have ADHD and I still take care of my pets. Obviously, not all people with ADHD are the same. But if she can't manage her ADHD enough to take care of a pet then she honestly shouldn't have one. Plus, Chloe's 14 not 5. She's more than old enough to be told that she can't have a new pet when she doesn't take care of the ones she has now.

It would have been better to tell her that it was her mom's call and her mom said no, so she should first see if her mom thinks she's ready. Then you could have asked her if there are ways she could prove to her mom that she's ready to care for such a little, little animal.  She's a terrible pet owner, but the bluntness wouldn't have been my approach.

You could have said in a way where you would be, but I'm gonna assume you didn't", "NTA. My boys are both Autistic, different as can be, are 5 and 8, and take care of a fishtank with multiple fish in it as well as a cat because they have a routine.

She has too many as is, and hamsters require much more than people think to be mentally stimulated and healthy. She is not responsible or mature and you are understandably preventing the animal from harm. Stay firm on this for sure", "NTA. Shes not a wee 5 year old that doesn\u2019t understand. And if someone doesn\u2019t explain things to her then she doesn\u2019t have the chance to try and learn/understand.

All it creates is insecurity and resentment.\n\nNTA.", "NTA also I\u2019m hoping the cat finds a better home! I\u2019m not fond of hamsters and even I wouldn\u2019t give your cousin one. Unless that hamster cage is cat proof, it would be dinner. \n\nLook sometimes I get to sick to scoop that day. My boy has 2  large storage tubs for litter boxes (he is a long cat/big cat.) The advantage to that is if I\u2019m sick and can\u2019t do one day, his litter boxes are still Ok to use for 48 hours. \n\nI\u2019m kinda hoping your aunt withholds dinner until the box gets scooped, every single day. Like \u201cyour dinner is ready let\u2019s go check the box. Oh no it isn\u2019t done, well go clean the box, your dinner can be reheated when you finish\u201d  The box gets cleaned, the cat gets fresh water and dinner, then you eat dinner kind of hard line. The cat gets fed then you get breakfast and pack your lunch. That or the kid has 1 week to shape up and care for the cat every single day or the cat is being rehomed to a no kill shelter (& mean it!) \n\nThe rule of thumb is 1 extra litter box plus 1 litter box per cat. The boxes should be 1.5 times the size of the cat (the reason my 19 inch long from nose to rear cat has storage tubs for litter boxes.) He like many cats likes to pee in one box and poop in the other box.

It's not about being forgetful, she admitted to you that she ignores the cat intentionally even when she knows what needs to be done. She deserved to know the truth because she was smart enough to figure out people were lying to her but not smart enough to know they did it to protect her from consequences.   \n\n\nYes, she is crying because she learned something serious about herself,  not because you hurt her. hopefully, the lesson will be useful.", "NTA pets a living things and need care", "NTA\n\nI have ADHD, and at that age, I was capable of caring for my dog. You know why? Because I actually cared about him.", "NTA. Telling terrible pet owners the truth of the matter is the way.\n\nIf they would rather complain to somebody instead of changing their behavior, then you can rest easy knowing you were right.\n\nAnd does Lily know that the first thing your cousin said was how she knew Aunt was lying? At least you can say you didn't lie to her. Not even her own mother can say that.", "NTA.  She does not seem to understand that she is caring for a living being.  An innocent creature should not have to suffer because she can\u2019t hear the word \u201cNo\u201d \n\nIf she is not taking care of the animals she currently has then she should not get another one under any circumstance.  Animals are not accessories or toys, they are living beings that require a lot of attention all the time.  I don\u2019t think you were out of line by pointing out the why behind your reasoning.  It sounds like it is borderline animal abuse, specifically not cleaning the litter box out of spite. Hopefully she matures and realizes she was wrong and does not get another animal until she is ready for it.", "NTA. ADHD isn\u2019t an excuse for not feeding or caring for your pets.", "This. This. This. I also have ADHD and the only pet I currently have is my cat my mother got me nearly 10 years ago when I was 16/17. Of course I feed and play and snuggle with my furbaby daily because I love him and I know I have to because no one else is going to do it (I have one housemate). But I would be lying if I said it wasn't exhausting and sometimes frustrating to the way my brain works that I have to complete the steps to keep another living creature alive AND happy. Because I'm an adult and can recognize this (and the many fish, my first cat and family dogs that my parents ending up caring for before I matured), I'm at a point where I've been able to admit to myself that I may not want to get another pet (or have real human children) after my boy passes because it does take a lot of work and discipline that you can't just simply forget to do because the consequences of forgetting are major. This 14 year old needed to hear the truth that unfortunately at this time their skills and discipline aren't up to par and that if she wants to own pets in the future, she has to find a way to learn what she can actually handle, how to prioritize caring for another living being, and honestly how to not chase after every idea or thing that makes her feel good  because people with ADHD are impulsive by nature.", "Maybe if Aunt Kimberley was less concerned about hurting Chole's feelings maybe Chole's current pets wouldn't be being abused. Like seriously WTF, why does Chole think it's acceptable to punish the cat because she was angry at her mum for grounding her. Chole needs to have the pets she currently has taken off her. That is not acceptable behaviour by any means.", "And honestly, I don't know where people got the idea that making someone feel bad about themselves is inherently bad. Making someone feel bad by making fun of them for interests or looks? Yes, bad. Making someone feel guilt/shame/remorse by pointing out their bad behaviors so they (hopefully) reflect and make changes? Not bad.", "And why would you put a hamster in the same house as a cat? They're amazing at getting out and are the exact sort of things cats hunt.", "Or the girl that lost her turtle (she left it outside on the lawn for a walk) and then got mad because the police who found the turtle, out in nature roaming about freely next to the road, did not recognize that it was an invasive species being kept as a pet and brought it to the closest local body of water to release it. We all tried to be kind about it, but there was a point where some of us were like...\"Okay, but they can't break out and they don't exactly run...so like...maybe you shouldn't have left a turtle outside, without enclosure or supervision for god knows how long??\"", "Agreed. I\u2019m (probably- still mid diagnosis) ADHD and pets are difficult. I love my pet but he is hard work! Even though he\u2019s a low maintenance species (hammies are NOT a low maintenance species).\n\nEven though I have stayed on top of looking after my animals as an adult (less so as a kid when I had parental backup and I wasn\u2019t motivated by terror) I constantly worry about letting it slip- I have nightmares about having forgotten pets on the regular that are plain traumatising.\n\nI\u2019m only just letting myself get a houseplant again after letting a million of the things die (because houseplants are way easier to accidentally forget than animals, though not much less guilt inducing) at thirty-two, and that\u2019s only because technology has advanced to the point where my smartwatch can remind me to water it every day (because the tiny computer physically attached to my body is the only system that has ever worked for me longer than a month, because that\u2019s when the novelty factor wears off).\n\nI get the impulse of the shiny new thing completely but animals are just not something you can let that instinct have free rein over.", "I know. I don\u2019t want to encourage bullying by saying this, but sometimes shame helps us learn and grow. Especially from a peer. Being told something from a peer/slightly older teenager will hold a lot more weight than coming from a parent. Obviously that doesn\u2019t mean kids should be allowed or taught to be cruel or to mock people for things, but if someone is doing something wrong, and they\u2019re told that, it\u2019s a normal reaction to feel badly.", "This.  We\u2019ve gotten to the point where people think \u201coffending anyone is bad\u201d but it is a serious disservice to society as a whole to not point out troublesome behavior."]}
