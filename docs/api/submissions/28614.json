{"id": 28614, "submission_id": "1749emd", "title": "AITA For \"being mean\" to my little cousin by telling her that she is a terrible pet owner?", "selftext": "17F here. My friend 16F \"Lily\" bought a hamster who turned out to be pregnant. The baby hamsters are going to be old enough to leave the mom in a week, so before that, I've been helping to tell as many people as possible to make sure the babies get adopted.\n\nMy cousin 14F \"Chloe\" found out and has been begging me to give her one of the baby hamsters because she really wants one and promises to take care of it.\n\nLike I said in the title though, Chloe is a terrible pet owner. Chloe's the one who begged my Aunt \"Kimberly\" for the pets they have right now (a cat, a betta fish, and a goldfish) but never takes care of them.\n\nThey got both of the fish from a carnival. Aunt Kimberly wanted to give the fish to someone else but Chloe begged her to keep them and promised she would take care of them. Chloe took care of them at first but after a few months she pretty much got bored of them and now Aunt Kimberly basically does all the work.\n\nBefore that, Chloe begged for a cat. Aunt Kimberly says she has to remind Chloe twice a day to feed the cat and refill its water bowl. Chloe admits to me that if Aunt Kimberly grounds her for something, she won't clean the cat's litter because she's mad at her mom. So the cat is stuck stepping on its poop until Aunt Kimberly notices and forces Chloe to clean it while hovering over her.\n\nAunt Kimberly obviously told Chloe that she couldn't have one of Lily's baby hamsters and said it was because they couldn't afford one. Chloe kept telling me how she knows her mom is lying about not being able to afford a hamster because Aunt Kimberly and her husband went somewhere nice recently and basically that her mom is a jerk because Chloe promised to take care of the hamster.\n\nI told Chloe that, no offense, but I don't think she should have a hamster either. She's a terrible pet owner to the pets she has now and never takes care of them even though she promised to when she first got them. Why should she get a new pet that's honestly more work than a cat or fish?\n\nChloe apparently told Aunt Kimberly about it. Aunt Kimberly told me that she knows I was sticking up for her, but calling Chloe a terrible pet owner was \"mean\" and she was trying not to make Chloe feel bad about herself.\n\nLily agreed that Chloe wouldn't have been a good hamster owner. But Lily also told me that I could have just repeated Aunt Kimberly's excuse of not being able to afford it. Lily said it was a bit mean because Chloe does have ADHD, so her maturity is lower than other kids her age and she's naturally more forgetful.\n\nI also have ADHD and I still take care of my pets. Obviously, not all people with ADHD are the same. But if she can't manage her ADHD enough to take care of a pet then she honestly shouldn't have one. Plus, Chloe's 14 not 5. She's more than old enough to be told that she can't have a new pet when she doesn't take care of the ones she has now.

Sounds like she likes the novelty of the new pet but once that wears off she ignores the animal in favor of the next new thing.  \n\nYou are right to be honest with Chloe about why she doesn\u2019t deserve any new pets until she can prove she\u2019s capable and willing to take care of the ones she\u2019s already been given.  It\u2019s not \u201cmaking her feel bad about herself\u201d.  It\u2019s telling her why her behavior isn\u2019t acceptable.", "NTA. The truth hurts, but it had to be said. Your cousin is too irresponsible to take care of the pets she has now. Hamsters are so high maintenance, it would've just been more work for your aunt.", "NTA. A living baby animal deserves the care needed to keep it alive and healthy.  You could have said it in a more encouraging way. It would have been better to tell her that it was her mom's call and her mom said no, so she should first see if her mom thinks she's ready. Then you could have asked her if there are ways she could prove to her mom that she's ready to care for such a little, little animal.  She's a terrible pet owner, but the bluntness wouldn't have been my approach. It was a missed opportunity to encourage her to be a better caretaker for the variety of fauna she's already taken responsibility for.", "NTA\n\nThe hamster deserves better than this!", "NTA\n\nI foresee the top being left off the hamster enclosure and the kitty doing what kitties naturally do . . . .", "NTA. Was it brutally honest? Maybe. But you had the best interests of everyone including Chloe and the hamster in mind. Could you have worded it more tactfully? Probably, so maybe consider that for next time. \n\nAnyone who lets an animal live in it's own poop just to be petty when they're mad really shouldn't have pets at all.", "NTA. \n\nHaving vivid flashbacks to the ADHD reddit girl who forgot about her hamster for a week. Animals are living things that rely on us for care; if she can't remember to feed and water a cat - a pet that roams free in the house - then a more dependent animal is a disaster waiting to happen.
