We share five kids ( 15m , 12f , 10m , 10f, 4m ) . Mark and I split after he cheated on me with Mandy ( 35F) about 3 years ago. Only the oldest 2 know why we divorced.\n\nThe other day , I was picking up the kids from Mark's house after work. When i pulled up my oldest texted me that Mandy wouldn't let them leave until they call her mom. \n\nI saw red and started pounding on the door screaming for her to let my kids out. Mandy answered and said the kids needed a stable mother figure sighting my work schedule. I work long hours as a nurse in a hospice center but I'm home for my kids.\n\nI called her crazy and said she'd only be the step mom not a mother to them.\n\nI took them home and Mark called me , saying I was out of line for the way I acted towards his wife.\n\nMy coworkers think I acted like any mother would, my parents meanwhile said I shouldn't have acted like that around the kids\n\nSo AITA for telling my kids' step mom she'll never be their mother", "created_utc": 1681960381, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12sk1zu/aita_for_telling_my_exs_wife_that_she_isnt_my/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
