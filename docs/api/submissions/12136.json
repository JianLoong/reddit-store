My son loves to cook and bake. To him it\u2019s his source of relaxation. Alfredo, burgers, pizza, you name it. Heck even a whole cake he can make it. Everyone who\u2019s met him knows he\u2019s a fantastic cook.\nHowever, he prefers to only cook for himself and gets really annoyed when my twins walk in on him cooking and ask him to make them food as well. He\u2019ll end up doing it but he does it very begrudgingly and usually gives them a much smaller portion than his own serving, which my twins don\u2019t like. They both have jobs, and will sometimes use their job money to buy us all a little fast food. So they find it really upsetting how their younger brother never returns the favor by primarily cooking for himself.\nThe other day, neither of my twins had class and weren\u2019t really in the mood for the food that we had in the house. My son came back from school and decided to make himself some banana pudding. When my twins asked for some as well, he told them they could just make it themselves and the ingredients were all still there.\nMy son put the banana pudding in the fridge and went to go take a shower while it was chilling. When he came back down he saw that my twins had eaten it all and this really upset him. \nWhen he told me about the situation I confronted the twins to which they said it was really rude for him to only make something for himself knowing that they were hungry as well and like he said, he could always make some more. I told my son that while they shouldn\u2019t have eaten his food that they were right, and he was very inconsiderate. My son replied that it\u2019s not fair how he gets back from school and is expected to make food for his older siblings. That they can just get a cookbook and learn how to make things for themselves. I told my son that if he\u2019s not going to cook for everybody than he can\u2019t cook anymore. \nHe\u2019s been pretty moody ever since. Obviously his brothers shouldn\u2019t have eaten his food but it takes no effort to just make a larger portion of the food he\u2019s cooking so that everybody can have it. My husband thinks I\u2019m in the right but I\u2019m really not happy with how things are right now between my children.

You will make him hate cooking just because your oldest can\u2019t be bothered to prepare things for themselves.\n\nDid it ever occur to you that your youngest might be more inclined to offer to cook food for others if they *appreciated* him and didn\u2019t treat him as a live-in cook? If they didn\u2019t behave in such entitled ways, he might be more receptive to sharing. Of course that\u2019s always his choice whether he would or not. The point is that it\u2019s your twins who are fostering this animosity by their behavior and sense of entitlement; they expect your youngest to prepare meals and dishes for them with nothing of the same value in return.

A definite hobby-killer: something I speak from experience.  \n\nYour twins are especially something else for eating what he made.

Ok, that's nice of them, but it's easy compared to cooking from scratch\n\n- the twins had been off all day, didn't want anything in the house, didn't bother to go out and buy anything, waited until your younger son got home, asked him for some of what he was making and when he said no they ate it anyway - wow, how is the younger one at fault for this?\n\nI think it's fair enough asking your younger son to share - but perhaps you could ask him in advance to cook things for everyone, instead of him having to do it on demand.

You're building the resentment between your kids. This is a great way to ensure your younger son cuts off contact with his brothers once he's out of the house. Shit like this from my mom is part of the reason I don't speak to my sibling. You're teaching your younger son that you favor the twins. They get a \"stern talking to\", and he gets a hobby taken away from him?  Do you cook for your kids at all? Why don't you suggest your kids cook together? Your older ones can learn from the younger one and also assist him in making more food so they can enjoy it too. If they want what he's making, they should contribute to it in some way.

They're 19, so i assume at some point they will be leaving home and won't have little brother as a personal chef.

Maybe if they were more selfless about it, the 16 year old would want to share his food more often. BUT - buying food is not the same as cooking it. It takes way more effort to spend an hour preparing a meal than it does shelling out a few bucks for some fast food.\n\nHave a sitdown with your sons and talk this out.

This is a hobby your son enjoys and it relaxes him. I get that he's using household resources to pursue his hobby, but if your twins were into a sport of any kind, that cost plenty, I'm sure.

That sounds fair to me. There is no reason to expect the youngest to make food for everyone every single time he cooks. If he was eating a snack like crackers or something, would he be expected to go ask everyone in the household if they want crackers too? I doubt it. If the 16 yo's hobby was painting, would he be expected to paint for everyone? Surely not. Your twins sound entitled and you sound like you enable them with much less regard to your younger son.

My son loves to cook and bake. To him it\u2019s his source of relaxation. Alfredo, burgers, pizza, you name it. Heck even a whole cake he can make it. Everyone who\u2019s met him knows he\u2019s a fantastic cook.\nHowever, he prefers to only cook for himself and gets really annoyed when my twins walk in on him cooking and ask him to make them food as well. He\u2019ll end up doing it but he does it very begrudgingly and usually gives them a much smaller portion than his own serving, which my twins don\u2019t like. They both have jobs, and will sometimes use their job money to buy us all a little fast food. So they find it really upsetting how their younger brother never returns the favor by primarily cooking for himself.\nThe other day, neither of my twins had class and weren\u2019t really in the mood for the food that we had in the house. My son came back from school and decided to make himself some banana pudding. When my twins asked for some as well, he told them they could just make it themselves and the ingredients were all still there.\nMy son put the banana pudding in the fridge and went to go take a shower while it was chilling. When he came back down he saw that my twins had eaten it all and this really upset him. \nWhen he told me about the situation I confronted the twins to which they said it was really rude for him to only make something for himself knowing that they were hungry as well and like he said, he could always make some more. I told my son that while they shouldn\u2019t have eaten his food that they were right, and he was very inconsiderate. My son replied that it\u2019s not fair how he gets back from school and is expected to make food for his older siblings. That they can just get a cookbook and learn how to make things for themselves. I told my son that if he\u2019s not going to cook for everybody than he can\u2019t cook anymore. \nHe\u2019s been pretty moody ever since. Obviously his brothers shouldn\u2019t have eaten his food but it takes no effort to just make a larger portion of the food he\u2019s cooking so that everybody can have it. My husband thinks I\u2019m in the right but I\u2019m really not happy with how things are right now between my children. So AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Plus idk about you but the serving size for teenage boys are huge. \n\nI made chili when my bf younger brother came for dinner to make sure I had enough. I didn\u2019t have leftovers and that was from one\u2026.", "My friend had just had a baby so hubbie was fending for  himself, while i was visiting them he came out the kitchen and askd me if you put cheese in the microwave to grate it. I have no words!!!", "Why would you ask someone to stop eating to make you food though? Now that\u2019s inconsiderate", "I was thinking the same thing. All food described is less than healthy", "In regards to the food itself though, I don\u2019t see driving through a drive thru, per se, the equivalent of making/baking banana pudding.", "Okay, so the equivalent thing here is the work and the payoff. For the twins, they work which gets them money. For the youngest, he works (cooks) which gets him food.\n\nIf the youngest saw his older brothers had money and got frustrated because he doesn\u2019t have a job to make money, would it be reasonable for him to demand that they give him money? I mean, they make a lot of money! They might as well share it, right? They can give him $20 every paycheck, it won\u2019t even take them much more effort. He\u2019s entitled to that, right?\n\nThe answer is no. It\u2019d be unreasonable for him to feel entitled to their money, which they earned by working. It\u2019s unreasonable for the twins to feel entitled to his food, which he created by cooking. No one is entitled to the fruits of another person\u2019s labor, except literal babies and children to their parents.", "It is more effort to make for more people.\n\nAnd as I said in a different comment, I think the son would be more inclined to share *on his own* if his older siblings didn\u2019t act with such entitlement. If the younger brother doesn\u2019t stand up for himself, he\u2019s encouraging that sense of entitlement. They were selfish for trying to mooch off of his food, he\u2019s trying to not be made into their personal chef. He\u2019s setting boundaries because they keep expecting him to cook for them. Being *forced* to share will only make him resentful, as what\u2019s happened here.", "No\u2026family doesn\u2019t put *all* of the labor onto one person whom they take advantage of. Or at least they shouldn\u2019t. If a family does that, it\u2019s dysfunctional. A healthy family shares with one another when appropriate but takes \u201cno\u201d for an answer and respects the time/feelings of everyone in the family. They delegate chores and responsibilities so one person isn\u2019t overwhelmed. They don\u2019t treat each other as unpaid maids.", "Takeout every once in while and cooking everyday for two people is not the same", "Willing to bet that if he cooked for them everyday there would never be takeout", "Yeah, that's definitely true. Anything where the packet says 'serves two' you might as well buy one each for teenagers!", "It seems they did if you look at mother's comments. Saw him eating a cheese toastie so asked/told him to make them one. Suspect there is a pattern here and just come to a head.", "Glad I'm not in your family. Ish", "??? So your family puts all of the work on one person whom is treated like an unpaid maid??? And you don\u2019t respect the time or feelings of those you love???", "No. But no one in my family would ever be so selfish that if they made banana pudding. They wouldn't make enough for everyone. We worked together. As a family. It brought us joy to treat each other. You obviously are projecting some personal issues that you haven't resolved.", "I think the fact that you called a child indulging in a hobby \u201cnot right in the head\u201d is much more indicative of you projecting personal issues, but eh.\n\nBut again, the issue is that OP\u2019s family *is not working together.* They expect the youngest son to do all of the work. The twins are *refusing* to work together with their brother and instead expect him to do all of the cooking for them. *That* is what makes it unhealthy. The fact that they *aren\u2019t* working together.", "I'm just stating my opinion. I don't need your blessing.  Who cares what any of you think of it. I don't know you. You have no power or authority.  You're just some nobody. And yes, you get to have an opinion,  but so what. The younger child is a selfish asshat. He makes food and flaunts in front of his siblings because he knows it will piss them off. If you don't like it? Stick it! Go work on your own life.", "Alright friendo, and you work on yours. Peace to ya."]}
