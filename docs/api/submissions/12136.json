My son loves to cook and bake. To him it\u2019s his source of relaxation. Alfredo, burgers, pizza, you name it. Heck even a whole cake he can make it. Everyone who\u2019s met him knows he\u2019s a fantastic cook.\nHowever, he prefers to only cook for himself and gets really annoyed when my twins walk in on him cooking and ask him to make them food as well. He\u2019ll end up doing it but he does it very begrudgingly and usually gives them a much smaller portion than his own serving, which my twins don\u2019t like. They both have jobs, and will sometimes use their job money to buy us all a little fast food. So they find it really upsetting how their younger brother never returns the favor by primarily cooking for himself.\nThe other day, neither of my twins had class and weren\u2019t really in the mood for the food that we had in the house. My son came back from school and decided to make himself some banana pudding. When my twins asked for some as well, he told them they could just make it themselves and the ingredients were all still there.\nMy son put the banana pudding in the fridge and went to go take a shower while it was chilling. When he came back down he saw that my twins had eaten it all and this really upset him. \nWhen he told me about the situation I confronted the twins to which they said it was really rude for him to only make something for himself knowing that they were hungry as well and like he said, he could always make some more. I told my son that while they shouldn\u2019t have eaten his food that they were right, and he was very inconsiderate. My son replied that it\u2019s not fair how he gets back from school and is expected to make food for his older siblings. That they can just get a cookbook and learn how to make things for themselves. I told my son that if he\u2019s not going to cook for everybody than he can\u2019t cook anymore. \nHe\u2019s been pretty moody ever since. Obviously his brothers shouldn\u2019t have eaten his food but it takes no effort to just make a larger portion of the food he\u2019s cooking so that everybody can have it. My husband thinks I\u2019m in the right but I\u2019m really not happy with how things are right now between my children.

You will make him hate cooking just because your oldest can\u2019t be bothered to prepare things for themselves.\n\nDid it ever occur to you that your youngest might be more inclined to offer to cook food for others if they *appreciated* him and didn\u2019t treat him as a live-in cook? If they didn\u2019t behave in such entitled ways, he might be more receptive to sharing. Of course that\u2019s always his choice whether he would or not. The point is that it\u2019s your twins who are fostering this animosity by their behavior and sense of entitlement; they expect your youngest to prepare meals and dishes for them with nothing of the same value in return.

A definite hobby-killer: something I speak from experience.  \n\nYour twins are especially something else for eating what he made.

Ok, that's nice of them, but it's easy compared to cooking from scratch\n\n- the twins had been off all day, didn't want anything in the house, didn't bother to go out and buy anything, waited until your younger son got home, asked him for some of what he was making and when he said no they ate it anyway - wow, how is the younger one at fault for this?\n\nI think it's fair enough asking your younger son to share - but perhaps you could ask him in advance to cook things for everyone, instead of him having to do it on demand.

You're building the resentment between your kids. This is a great way to ensure your younger son cuts off contact with his brothers once he's out of the house. Shit like this from my mom is part of the reason I don't speak to my sibling. You're teaching your younger son that you favor the twins. They get a \"stern talking to\", and he gets a hobby taken away from him?  Do you cook for your kids at all? Why don't you suggest your kids cook together? Your older ones can learn from the younger one and also assist him in making more food so they can enjoy it too. If they want what he's making, they should contribute to it in some way.

They're 19, so i assume at some point they will be leaving home and won't have little brother as a personal chef.

Maybe if they were more selfless about it, the 16 year old would want to share his food more often. BUT - buying food is not the same as cooking it. It takes way more effort to spend an hour preparing a meal than it does shelling out a few bucks for some fast food.\n\nHave a sitdown with your sons and talk this out.

This is a hobby your son enjoys and it relaxes him. I get that he's using household resources to pursue his hobby, but if your twins were into a sport of any kind, that cost plenty, I'm sure.

That sounds fair to me. There is no reason to expect the youngest to make food for everyone every single time he cooks. If he was eating a snack like crackers or something, would he be expected to go ask everyone in the household if they want crackers too? I doubt it. If the 16 yo's hobby was painting, would he be expected to paint for everyone? Surely not. Your twins sound entitled and you sound like you enable them with much less regard to your younger son.

My son loves to cook and bake. To him it\u2019s his source of relaxation. Alfredo, burgers, pizza, you name it. Heck even a whole cake he can make it. Everyone who\u2019s met him knows he\u2019s a fantastic cook.\nHowever, he prefers to only cook for himself and gets really annoyed when my twins walk in on him cooking and ask him to make them food as well. He\u2019ll end up doing it but he does it very begrudgingly and usually gives them a much smaller portion than his own serving, which my twins don\u2019t like. They both have jobs, and will sometimes use their job money to buy us all a little fast food. So they find it really upsetting how their younger brother never returns the favor by primarily cooking for himself.\nThe other day, neither of my twins had class and weren\u2019t really in the mood for the food that we had in the house. My son came back from school and decided to make himself some banana pudding. When my twins asked for some as well, he told them they could just make it themselves and the ingredients were all still there.\nMy son put the banana pudding in the fridge and went to go take a shower while it was chilling. When he came back down he saw that my twins had eaten it all and this really upset him. \nWhen he told me about the situation I confronted the twins to which they said it was really rude for him to only make something for himself knowing that they were hungry as well and like he said, he could always make some more. I told my son that while they shouldn\u2019t have eaten his food that they were right, and he was very inconsiderate. My son replied that it\u2019s not fair how he gets back from school and is expected to make food for his older siblings. That they can just get a cookbook and learn how to make things for themselves. I told my son that if he\u2019s not going to cook for everybody than he can\u2019t cook anymore. \nHe\u2019s been pretty moody ever since. Obviously his brothers shouldn\u2019t have eaten his food but it takes no effort to just make a larger portion of the food he\u2019s cooking so that everybody can have it. My husband thinks I\u2019m in the right but I\u2019m really not happy with how things are right now between my children. So AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

However, as anyone who's ever cooked in their life knows, a quick meal from a drive-through isn't exactly the same as a home cooked meal. There's time and effort put in to make sure that it tastes quality, which you certainly won't get at a fast-food chain. Your youngest isn't obligated to cook meals in exchange for something that likely took ten minutes to finish cooking and be picked up. \n\nSecondly, there was other stuff in the house to eat that day.

For example: son A cooks on Monday, son B on Wednesday, son C on Friday, you and your DH cover the other days (maybe even make one or two days as \u201cfend for yourself\u201d days).  \n\nRight now, you\u2019ve shown your 16yo who you favor - and it isn\u2019t him.  Don\u2019t be shocked if he goes LC or NC in a couple of years.  You need to approach this with a more balanced method.  Your twins ate what he made for himself, and you all expect him to suck it up and make more - NO.  Stop that.  THEY ate it, THEY replace it.  End of story.  If he ate something of theirs, would you expect them to suck it up and replace it themselves?  Or would you tell him to replace what he took, as is fair?  \n\nMake some house rules.  One, NOBODY is to be expected to feed everybody all of the time (bc that\u2019s just unreasonable and logistically impossible for a busy family).

His older siblings need to learn to take care of their hunger themselves.

They can even stop buying fast food for little bro, if that makes them feel better about the tradeoff, seeing as their main complaint seems to be that they get fast food for little bro and feel they get nothing in return from him when he's cooking. Something tells me little bro won't mind the tradeoff, if it means he stops being pestered about cooking for others.\n\nAlso, the twins did not need banana pudding. That's a  dessert. If they were hungry, they should have made themselves a sandwich or other actual food, and then made themselves some pudding later. They could do it for themselves, instead of expecting their brother to change the recipe mid-process just because they happened to arrive home when he was making something for himself (multiplying the amount from a one-person serving to three mid-process would be a bit more complex and might mess up the texture of the pudding).\n\nYou twins are old enough that they can feed themselves instead of relying on their kid brother to cook for them.", "YTA your son should tell his brothers that he'll cook for them if they prepare ingredients with him.
