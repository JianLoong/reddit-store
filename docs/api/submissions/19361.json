The guests that enter the casino and even the women that work there. Imo comments like \"great knockers\" or \"that's a fine ass\" could get a pass. I myself don't use such terms to describe women but its ok. I was even dating a cashier that most of the guys here wanted to bone and sexualised regularly but I never let it bother me.\n\nI can give you an example of a discussion they were having today. There's a chick with a really hot bod and these guys were like \"she has a great bubble butt, I'd stick my dick in it and not let it out all day\" and then another female guest that walked in with cleavage showing they were like \"you just rip off her dress, suck on her tits, then close her dress off, then open up her tits, suck on it and do it all day whenever needed\". They also zoom in cctv cameras and there's a guy that's like \" Damn check that cashiers ass out, I'd hold her hips *proceeds to perform humping actions and make gestures* and says I'd fuck her ass like that all day\". Then proceeds to check her out and sometimes act like he's masturbating for the rest of the day.\n\nI ask those guys to tone it down in such instances, I'm not very uptight in most instances and these guys make sexual jokes about me too and I just don't mind most of the times.\n\nBut I asked this guy who wanted to fuck this cashier about what his views would be if his girl was working there and other guys wanted to nail her and made comments like those and he was like I would beat the fuck outta them. And I was like wow, so you wouldn't want other guys having sexual attraction to your girl since you'd find it degrading but you can do the same to other women. Another instance he points out to a woman with huge tits and is like \"God look at those tits\" and I was like you should date her and he's like nah I'd just fuck her and leave, she'd get too much sexual attention from the guys.\n\nSo this is how these guys view all these women, \"fuck her and leave\" and constantly slut shame them even if these women decide to sleep around and call any guy who takes them seriously a loser. Recently a receptionist got married to another receptionist and these guys are like the guy that married her is a loser, she's been knocked up by a couple of us itself.\n\nAnd then I tell them to tone it down, even though I'm younger than them and it's been just 7 months since I joined, they call me prudish.\n\nTLDR - Colleagues get too thirsty, I tell them to tone it down, get called a prude. Colleagues don't respect women except for as sexual commodities and think that any guy who takes them seriously is a loser, \"just fuck and leave\", constantly slut shame, tell them to tone it down and I'm a prude.\n\nAITA here and need to lighten up and let it fly or I'm in the right to tell them to tone it down and show women some respect.", "created_utc": 1686318228, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1455nl9/aita_for_telling_colleagues_to_cool_off_or_am_i/", "score": 458, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

One of them was like I'd beat them up if someone tried to wanna have sex with my girlfriend if I'm serious with the girl. I'm like ok.

I am a M 25 who just recently started working there. About 7 months in. I know and do realise how insanely hostile this environment is. I speak up against it but then I'm isolated, gossiped about and all sorts of backhanded political games are played with me.\n\nI was dating a cashier F 23 who was being objectified, sexualised by these men behind a computer screen and with controls of the CCTV cameras of the whole casino. I spoke to her about this disgusting behaviour. She told me to ignore it since it's behind her back and even she won't be able to report it and if she does she'd have to mention it which would mean the end of my career in casino industry. Since surveillance is like the dead end and once you work in surveillance you cannot switch to working in any other department and YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DATE OR HAVE ANY PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH EMPLOYEES OF OTHER DEPARTMENTS. So we both thought about it, and she said it doesn't affect her, she was like let them talk, let them lust after me, doesn't mean they're going to snatch me away and I took her word and focused on our relationship instead.\n\nJust the one instance where I told people to shut up was when one of them called her a slut for talking to too many guys. He apologized to me and never did it again but that was the day most people figured out we were indeed dating and now they can use it against me.\n\nThe girl in question (we broke up recently due to other personal reasons) so she's my ex now. So my ex wants to keep her job until she completes a year at least by September. Same with me as even I had joined in September last year. Then we can think about quitting.\n\nAnd the rest of the objectification that goes on is as I've mentioned in the post. Like these guys think since it's all men in the department and since they have the total control over all the cameras in the casino they can gawk over and make such comments about women. Even our Head of department is sexist and doesn't allow women to join surveillance but maybe even he's aware of potential rapists like these being in there.\n\nWhen it came to my girlfriend, the best option for me was to ignore them and not let it affect our relationship. When it comes to other women, I don't participate in their discussions neither do I show them that I find it even remotely funny.\n\nThey are uncivilized perverts from some rural areas of these countries and they've probably seen women these good looking for the first time in their lives.\n\nBut yeah there's a stereotype about indians being pervs. Well it's true as this post is an example of one incident", ">Stand up for your patrons or quit your job.\n\nThis might be easy enough for you to say, free from the consequences as you are, but not so much for OP.

This is just foul.", "These conversations are not ok period.  What a bunch of fucking pigs", "You obviously haven't been to India where a culture like this is being normalised. I posted about it in r/AskMen too and they're like you haven't heard what women talk about in private, it isn't wrong to discuss with your peers how hot a woman is, you need to take it as a weird compliment that they're lusting over someone you're dating etc.\n\nIt's tough as a young man in his mid-20s here. They'd have to fire at least 60% of out department if I do my best to report them and get the evidence and stuff but that's obviously not happening and it is a losing battle.\n\nI feel like I'm alone. I discussed this with a woman from cashier department and she's like since it's happening behind my back I won't be able to report it to HR without involving you. And that would be the end of our careers since everyone will figure out we know each other and used to date and that's not allowed according to company ethics.

Aren't they deserving of the same type of respect? \n\nHe later on points out a woman with large tits and gawks at her and I tell him that you should date women like those if you're into them and he's like nah they're just for fucking and leaving, they'd get too much sexual attention from other men, I want someone who covers up and stuff like that's their thought process. It's disgusting.", "You have absolutely nailed it bro. The culture, along with the fact that it's literally a backroom full of just guys with camera controls all around and these guys start objectifying women and speak their desires and fantasies openly. They were literally showing their boners to each other yesterday like wtf lmao saying that this is what happens when all these hot women walk in and they have the entire access to all the cameras.

This is being excessively vulgar and wildly immature. Sad if the entire country is normalizing being a pathetic excuse for a person. You did post this publicly, so you're going to get this exact thought from most people, because we don't live in a country like this and would never in a million years act like that kind of behavior is okay. Because it's not. Tell them to grow up and stop acting like 12 year olds who just discovered their wee wees go up sometimes.
