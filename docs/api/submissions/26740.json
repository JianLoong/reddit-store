I have made it clear that i fully intend to pull my own weight, but we are both completely aware and okay with the fact that I'm never going to earn even as much as her, let alone more, and as such our share of expenses is obviously going to reflect that.\n\nWomen like this do exist OP, do not settle for someone who only sees you as an ATM.

So let her know your goal in life isn't to pay for her and or her family's expenses. You want a partner. \n\nDoes she want to build a future with you? Tell her you've been happy until now and hoped it could continue, but regardless of your ex, that's not what you want and if it's what she's looking for you should both walk away.", "And if she's caving to these pressures and buying what they're selling, you need to firmly stand up for reasonable. At that point, she's going to have to pick because you need to be a rock. \n\n\n\nYou're worth it. Seriously.", "I have never seen one of these relationships work out well for the man. It will totally ruin you financially, and when you have nothing left to give, and a mountain of debt, she WILL leave. Because this is all about what you can spend on her. You can't be a sugar daddy on a nutrasweet budget. What she wants, essentially, is a sugar daddy.", "Best wishes bro", "Yep. A princesses. Some are truly awful, others are just spoiled but still good. I'd start small if I were you, if you go to a gas station to get gas pick up her favorite candy bar or a rose or even coffee if she likes that. Compliment her. If she shows appreciation for that you can up the ante and suggest once a month going to a nice little place and wine and dine her within your budget. Do picnics or hang by the pool (outings that don't cost much money),  things like that.\n\nStay within your means, even the richest of us understand that being frugal will often serve you better. If she doesn't appreciate your effort or if she demands more of you financially then you can afford then she's one of the bad ones.", "Good luck, and i hope you become an RN.

Dont let anyone get in the way of that, least of all some short-term fuckbuddy", "So what does she do for you? \n\nShe is going not going to be passive aggressive. She is gonna get mad and try to manipulate you and gaslighting If she does this  i hope you are listening to her actions.  \n\nLookout for yourself. No one else is going to do that for you. A good partner will compromise and try to work things out.", "Smh.\n\nMy friend recently graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering. When I spoke to him, I found out he had no college debt.\n\nThe reason? He had a gf, but made sure it was always 50/50.  \n\nThink about how much a date cost? How often you two go out. When your not paying the cost, people try generally don\u2019t care about saving.\n\nYou save so much money by simply not eating out.", "Thank you I\u2019ll look into this", "Not gonna lie, the internet has ruined me and I was halfway trying to work out in my head why it said licensed psychotherapist and not a domme or something... In this context could I ask what CBT refers to?", "I appreciate your comment and yeah I do plan on discussing this with her. We had this initial conversation that started this over the phone while she was getting ready for work so it obviously didn\u2019t end well.", "We have been discussing this and it has felt like we\u2019re talking in circles but we both are slowly making compromises. I have (possibly a na\u00efve) hope that we can fix this and work things out like we have multiple times before. If not then it\u2019s the only option to walk away.", "She has been very kind to me in the past, and very supportive. This is a fairly new occurrence.", "I mean prior to this we were fine, it\u2019s my suspicion that it\u2019s like her family and friends pressuring her into this ideals.", "She\u2019s never been like this prior and has been happily doing things for me and I for her in return. It\u2019s just started happening recently as of late. She\u2019s been mentioned her family and friends often when these conversations happen as well. I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s personal greed, cultural norms, or familial and friend based pressure tbh", "I really hope not, because I was really beginning to feel safe and happy again.", "We\u2019re the same age of 23", "I did bring up what she wanted as a dynamic if I was even able to pay for everything and she had mentioned that she wants to stay independent but she wants me to pay more often completely since she grew up seeing it and kinda equates it to a love sign.", "As a Mexican woman this is 100% correct. In most Latin cultures the man should provide and the woman does everything else. Literally everything else. And if that\u2019s now what she\u2019s going to do fuck her and her entitled princess attitude", "That is a possibility", "Yeah I\u2019ve paid for several and even paid for the last date. I try to pay when I can afford it but I\u2019ve also done it when I honestly can\u2019t and I ended up needing to borrow money from family to make ends meet. She does make double my income though and we\u2019ve been fine for the longest.", "She did tell me she doesn\u2019t care what they think because they don\u2019t know how hard I work and how I\u2019m working to better myself.

I work really hard and I do strive to become a better person and better off person. I can understand wanting your parents approval and I feel that plays a major part in her thought process right now. I\u2019ll do what I can to maintain my beliefs and boundaries in hopes that she will I\u2019ll see that.", "Thank you I\u2019m going to have to try this, I really hope she\u2019s not a bad one", "I really appreciate this comment, it makes me happy to see support", "She does invite me over often, cook for me there, buy me things, and she even planned a birthday party for me and decorated for it. I keep the same energy in the relationship and do my best to be romantic with my budget and sometimes making things by hand since I\u2019m proficient with woodworking.", "She also has no college debt but it was paid off by her father.

Pour freely when things are clearer.", "OP, if she insists it\u2019s a cultural thing- she doesn\u2019t want to change. And I am sorry, but how selfish can someone be to say hey I make twice the amount you do but if you love me, you will pay for everything!! Uhhh no. It\u2019s not only selfish, but it\u2019s immature, narcissistic, and quite honestly insulting. RUN AWAY. I promise you one day you will find a partner who values you and all that you bring and will help balance the life, not take away from it.", "I hope things work out for you!", "Social media can be so damaging and it seems so many people are susceptible.

If what she says it true she would have dumped you when you discussed 50-50.\n\nWith abusive people, they are usually on 'best behaviour' and reveal their true selves as time goes on, or some event happens where they feel the victim has committed.  \n\nThis is only going to get worse. Leave, and as others have suggested get some therapy to break the cycle. I wish you the best.", "But, shes going along with it.", "Look I\u2019m a Latina too. The only cultural norm that she is talking about it\u2019s a sexist one, that actually exist in the entire world with the old fashion values. She is just trying to manipulate you. Of course that at the beginning she is not going to show those behaviors, but now that it\u2019s showing you need to decide if you want to be her meal ticket or if you want to have a real partner that love you for what you are and not for what you have to offer.", "Best wishes navigating these straits.", "To be fair, who wouldn\u2019t *love* the idea of being both financially independent and financially unaccountable?\n\nI say this because from what I\u2019ve scanned from your comments, you seem like a particularly nice person who\u2019s lacking in confidence: take a couple steps back and really analyse this situation.\n\nYou questioning whether you\u2019re an asshole or not for saying you can\u2019t spend money you physically don\u2019t have is ridiculous. Not as an insult to you, but the situation as a whole.
