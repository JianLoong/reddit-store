I like Bob and Lisa fine, but I know they treat me different than their bio kids and Adam and Braden remind me all the time that I\u2019m not really family.

That it's because of their bio kids? If you did, what was their response? \n\nNTA for not wanting to be around people who clearly don't like you.", "NTA \n\nYou need to get your foster parents alone and have a frank discussion with them. You have been there 4 years and the 12 and 11 year Olds still hate you and ostracize you. It will ruin what relationship you have with them and their relationship with their sons if it proceeds. That you care for them and all that, but it is not the best choice. \n\nThis scenario is why it is often recommended not to adopt out of birth order. There are many studies about this. Yes it can work, but not always. The oldest children were 8 and 7 and still have not came around. They probably never will, even after family therapy. Four years ago, they were the oldest and now not. This is also why biological children input on adoption and fostering should be taken into account.", "NTA and Bob\u2019s mom is not right. YOU deserve better. It's clear from your post that you don't feel welcome or accepted by this family. You can be grateful for all that Bob and Lisa do while still maintaining your independence. If Bob and Lisa truly view you as family and want to help you long after your 18th birthday that won't change after you age out. Don't ever commit to anything you're uncomfortable with, especially if it's to please someone else. You are smart and intuitive. Listen to yourself.", "Kudos to Bob and Lisa for fostering you for four years, and for wanting to adopt you!  I think that's awesome.  But...  over four years, what have they done to address Adam's hostility toward you, or the fact that they treat their bio kids differently than you?  I think these things would need to be addressed prior to entertaining thoughts of adoption...  maybe even with therapy.  And, at the end of the day, you may still decide not to pursue adoption.  Your choice.\n\nBob's mother is an AH for calling you ungrateful.", "I am going to be practical.\n\nAging out of foster care is a nightmare. They expect 18 yo's to have sufficient income to cover rent and skills to earn it. I have some friends who made it through and it was rough.\n\nI don't know where you will be in terms of education when you hit 18, but many careers are closed to people without college degrees. Even a community college degree can make a huge difference. Finishing HS is a must.\n\nSo, what do you want to be when you grow up?\n\nNot all bio-siblings get along, so having brothers that make life hard isn't just something you deal with in foster care or as an adopted daughter. Actually, you can sit down with your foster parents and explain just what is keeping you from committing - their two eldest's behaviors and bullying. What are they going to do to interceded and stop or minimize these behaviors going forward.\n\nAre your foster parents willing to help you get into college or some type of apprenticeship training? Because that's a huge step up. To be fair to you, I think you need to be more forthcoming about your wants, dreams, desires, and roadblocks.\n\nSo, while not perfect, I think allowing the adoption is going to help you in your life. If the boys continue to make life difficult, you can avoid them after going to college. But having people at you back as you make it through those critical young adult years is important. \n\nI had a friend who adopted her son as well as having two biological children and he got through college and went no contact. I don't say you have to go to those extremes, but do what's best for you in the longterm.", "NTA\n\nYou have your reasons and this is your choice. sit down with your foster parents without their bio kids there and tell them the reason why you don't want to be adopted, they shouldn't be offended by the truth .\n\nRemember this is your life and your choice.", "NTA - My thought is that you should agree with the condition that you all get family therapy first to address your concerns. Either the issues get resolved, or they get a clear vision that there are issues and they work on them. Either way, you get therapy!", "NTA. I'm so sorry you're in foster care and you're having to walk on eggshells in the family you've been placed in. I think you should be honest with Bob and Lisa about why you don't want to be adopted and about what Bob's mom said to you. They're not doing great jobs as parents if they're not handling their sons' feelings and they didn't do a good job integrating you into the family. None of this is your fault and you should not have to suffer for it.", "INFO: Have you actually explained your reasons for not wanting to be adopted to your foster parents?", "NTA- Bob and Lisa should not be putting you in this position. They know their oldest two kids do not treat you well, and they're putting the choice of adoption on you when that's only going to make things worse. If you say yes you'll probably be treated worse by the brothers, but if you say no you're hurting Lisa and Bob and you'll have other family telling you that you're wrong. You can't win either way. You need to have a serious conversation with Bob and Lisa and explain that two of their sons are extremely cruel to you and have made it clear they do not like having you around. It's not fair of them to ask for adoption knowing this is the situation, and pushing adoption is likely to just make it worse. They need to address the behavior of the other two sons before even thinking about adopting. If you want to be adopted but are being held back due to the behavior of the boys you need to tell them that. But if you just don't want to be adopted that's okay to. And they should not make you feel guilty for that choice. It doesn't matter how kind they are to you, that doesn't mean they've somehow earned the right to adopt you if that's not what you want, or you think it will make your life harder.", "NTA, have you brought up all this with Bob and Lisa? About their bio kids treating you that way?", "Everyone I know has bio-siblings that they hate/hate them. If you are interested in being a part of a family you will likely experience sibling hatred. Luckily they are young that there is the possibility of friendship when they are older. \n\nIf I were you I would look into the legal differences between adoption vs continuing the foster relationship. Are the parents asking because there are grants or stipends available? Are there monetary incentives for you or them one way or the other? If you don\u2019t get adopted would you be welcome to stay with them past 18? Do some research, sit down with them, ask some questions. It may be mutually beneficial to go through an adoption and it may be best for you to remain unaffiliated (for lack of a better word sorry) but either way try to be informed and keep communication open.", "NTA\n\nYou should sit down with Bob & Lisa and discuss this. Let them know you appreciate that they took you in and that they want to adopt you, but also tell them the reason you have hesitation and you feel it will cause resentment from their children.\n\nOr....you could let them adopt you just to spite the brats.", "NTA. Sit down with Bob and Lisa and definitely tell them about what was said to you. Explain that the boys make you feel like you will never truly be a full member of the family. Tell them you like them and like living with them but you feel better not doing anything adoption.", "NAH.\n\nFirst of all it is 100% your choice.  It doesn't seem like you have a personal reason to be adopted or not.  Their other children don't want you to be adopted because it somehow pushes them out.  Grandma thinks you are ungrateful to refuse, but she doesn't understand why.\n\nI think you should accept, because in the long run there will be many benefits and even if it doesn't seem so now, eventually when you are adults your relationship with your brothers will improve.  And really they won't care about the adoption, except to be annoyed at all the fuss.\n\nBut either way you should tell your foster parents EXACTLY WHY you are hesitant.  That you don't want to make things worse with their other kids.", "NTA, not at all. I understand your hesitation.\n\nThe other piece of realism to consider is that many foster situations are very, very bad and I believe you know this because you don't want to be sent back out into the system. You, and every person, deserve a loving family and 100% acceptance. But sometimes we have to make a decision in imperfect situations trying to make the best imperfect decision. ou hesitate to be fully truthful for fear that you'll be sent somewhere else. Adoption will remove this fear always hanging over you.\n\nEven in bio families, there is jealousy and sibling relationships that don't gel. I think family therapy will help, to give the parents and everyone tools to manage the situation. I strongly recommend asking for it. It may or may not be 100% successful but there are no guarantees with anything.\n\nEditing to remove several repeating paragraphs.", "Nta but I think you should ask them to set up a meeting for you to talk to someone knowledgeable about what exactly being adopted would mean vs stay in care beyond just that you couldn't be moved to different home. A social worker, a lawyer, a foster charity volunteer, etc\n\nWhat benefits and resources YOU might lose out on and what would still be available if you were adopted. You want and deserve all the information written down in black and white to be able to make the best decision for you.\n\nThis is a really big decision for someone to make, especially when they are so vulnerable. I do think you need to consider that you can be taken out of that home at any point.  What were other foster homes like? Have you ever stayed in a group home? It's really hard to find people to take teens esp in your age group, you would most likely be put in a group home if removed. You might also have to switch schools. \n\nIf you aren't in therapy, then request to go to help you have the big conversations with your foster parents. I do think it's important that they know why you don't want to be adopted so they can attempt to fix things. (I dont understand why they haven't already done this. They do know their bio kids aren't happy with you being there or being adopted, and they know they don't treat you well). \n\nThat bobs mom spoke to you may mean that the extended families accept you more than you think, even though she could and should have been kinder about the conversation. (Did your foster parents foster other kids before you? It may be that you feel temporary and they don't want tongetvattatched when you can be quickly ripped away)\n\nI hope things turn out well for you and end up the way you want.", "NTA You don't sound ungrateful to me. You sound like you have a sound a reasonable point of view. Its wonderful that they have treated you well. But if you don't feel like part of the family the adoption isn't probably going to change that. You don't owe anyone anything. Even though I'm sure they are foster parents out of kindness and love, they also get compensated for their work so granny can stuff it. \n\nLike some other comments you should have a talk with them. Its possible Bob and Lisa do absolutely care about you as though you're a bio kid and they are just having difficulty expressing it properly. \n\nThey can still be in your life when you age out without being adopted.", "NTA but I would suggest being honest with the parents about why you don\u2019t want to be adopted.", "I think it's time to sit down with Bob and Lisa away from everyone else and have a real talk about your future. There may be reasons they want to legally solidify your relationship such as preventing your removal or making you a legal heir and there may be reasons it's in your best interests to age out such as housing assistance or scholarships.", "Bob\u2019s mom is TAH.\n\nI think you should talk to them. Tell them that you\u2019re happy there, but you worry that an adoption would upset the other kids.\n\nIf Bob and Lisa suggest that the kids would get used to it, you can tell them that you don\u2019t want to do that to the kids, and forcing it on them wouldn\u2019t help.\n\nThey truly seem to care for you, so I hope that being honest would work out, but I understand your reservations.", "I think you need to look into what programs and scholarships will be available to you for college. See if it is better for you to have parents with income when filling out grants or self supporting. Will you be covered under their health insurance while at college if they adopt you? I think it is important to consider financials and your future when you make this decision.", "NTA\n\nBut...\n\nBob and Lisa are adults, the oldest brother is just a 12 year old kid...\nIts normal for that to happen in their age because they are... kids...\n\nTo me it seems very much that its Lisa's dream to get a girl since there are only 3 boys atm, and she probably thought it through very well by now.\n\nBut the kids can think they hate u now, they probably will change their minds like 20 times until they grow up tho so its possible that they will totally regret not letting their own mom have their dream daughter when they grow up, i think they would feel very bad bc its mainly their fault atm.\n\nBut if you listen more to Bob and Lisa, and obviously only if u want to be adopted yourself, then you will make the right decision and the boys will understand it too when they get older.", "YTA and don't think you are. I understand that 16 you may think you have a good grasp on the world but there's a lot you don't get yet so take this from someone that has some miles, made bad choices, made good choices and is still trying to figure it all out. \n\nYou need to open up to Bob and Lisa and think about your future. Once you \"age out\" I doubt they'd want you out of their lives, which is why they want you apart of their family, legally. They want you to have a stable family and a home. It's a lot to ask children to like someone, its even harder if they're told too. Thier other kids may never come around and feel like siblings and you need to explain how you feel about them; you they make you feel to Bob and Lisa. I suggest you talk, even if its a hard talk that a 16 year old shouldn't have to have, let yourself have a second chance at a family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Do it for your own mental and emotional wellbeing.", "You gotta tell Bob and Lisa about how the boys make you feel and what bob's mom said to you.  Theyre not smart enough to know what you're going through, you need to spell it out for them that part of the family is unwelcoming.", "You really should tell them", "I know in my state children aging out of foster care have some housing allowance and significant financial aid to state schools. OP should talk to their case worker and see what that looks like where they live. Unless the foster parents are offering a college fund with the adoption it may just be the practical choice to stay \u201cin the system.\u201d", "Its not a bad question to ask Bob & Linda what they are planning for college.  IF they are independently wealthy and can write a check for $100K without blinking then whatever.  But for the majority of people adding another kid at 16 isn't going to give enough time to build a college fund.", "True! OP should definitely talk to the foster parents about the financial/practical reality and what would be best (aging out of foster care is such a shit situation), and the bio kids. \n\nIt's OK to have a different relationship with the parents to the bio kids. It's OK to have siblings that resent you (sadly, that happens sometimes regardless). OP needs to look out for herself as much as she can.", "NTA, but do you have a counsellor (or an independent third party) you could talk to?  It sounds as if you are getting a lot of pressure from all sides put on you directly.  It would be good if there was someone who could advocate for you.", "Going to go NTA/bordering on NAH", "I don't have a great answer for you, and I wish I did, but I want to express to you that there IS a good ending; you are going to get through and be okay. Keep on going, keep your grades up in school and do what you need to do to be safe. Keep your focus on the lifestyle/outcome for your life that you want, and stay detail oriented on your way to it.", "[removed]", "I used to see a counselor before I came here but it didn\u2019t help much and I don\u2019t feel like she really listened to anything I said so finally just told her what she wanted to hear so she could feel like she succeeded and I could stop. I\u2019ve already talked to my caseworker, I just have to be careful about what I say.", "You havent done anything to hurt bob and lisas relationships with their other kids. the other kids did that damage. \n\nmake your decision without input from the other kids. bib and lisa clearly care about you, and your refusal is based on you caring for them. \n\ntell them why you feel how you feel. tell them you would never want to jeopardize their relationship with their kids.\n\n\nadoption provides you legal protection. i would strongly suggest you pursue it.", "I don\u2019t think the kids did the damage.\n\nI think Bob and Lisa have handled this terribly. They brought a helpless kid into a hostile family and have made no effort to address that hostility, with their children or with their older relatives. They\u2019ve latched onto this adoption idea as a band-aid solution that will (they assume) magically heal all of the anger and resentment in the family by legitimizing OP\u2019s status in the eyes of the law. But their other children aren\u2019t going to care about the law - they\u2019re *kids*, they barely understand it as a concept. They just know that OP did not grow up with them, the rest of the family does not see her as a \u201creal\u201d family member, and she requires time and attention from their parents that they wish they had for themselves. That is the beginning and end of their emotional calculus."]}
