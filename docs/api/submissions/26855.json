That it's because of their bio kids? If you did, what was their response? \n\nNTA for not wanting to be around people who clearly don't like you.", "NTA \n\nYou need to get your foster parents alone and have a frank discussion with them. You have been there 4 years and the 12 and 11 year Olds still hate you and ostracize you. It will ruin what relationship you have with them and their relationship with their sons if it proceeds. That you care for them and all that, but it is not the best choice. \n\nThis scenario is why it is often recommended not to adopt out of birth order. There are many studies about this. Yes it can work, but not always. The oldest children were 8 and 7 and still have not came around. They probably never will, even after family therapy. Four years ago, they were the oldest and now not. This is also why biological children input on adoption and fostering should be taken into account.", "NTA and Bob\u2019s mom is not right. YOU deserve better. It's clear from your post that you don't feel welcome or accepted by this family. You can be grateful for all that Bob and Lisa do while still maintaining your independence. If Bob and Lisa truly view you as family and want to help you long after your 18th birthday that won't change after you age out. Don't ever commit to anything you're uncomfortable with, especially if it's to please someone else. You are smart and intuitive. Listen to yourself.", "Kudos to Bob and Lisa for fostering you for four years, and for wanting to adopt you!  I think that's awesome.  But...  over four years, what have they done to address Adam's hostility toward you, or the fact that they treat their bio kids differently than you?  I think these things would need to be addressed prior to entertaining thoughts of adoption...  maybe even with therapy.  And, at the end of the day, you may still decide not to pursue adoption.  Your choice.\n\nBob's mother is an AH for calling you ungrateful.", "I am going to be practical.\n\nAging out of foster care is a nightmare. They expect 18 yo's to have sufficient income to cover rent and skills to earn it. I have some friends who made it through and it was rough.\n\nI don't know where you will be in terms of education when you hit 18, but many careers are closed to people without college degrees. Even a community college degree can make a huge difference. Finishing HS is a must.\n\nSo, what do you want to be when you grow up?\n\nNot all bio-siblings get along, so having brothers that make life hard isn't just something you deal with in foster care or as an adopted daughter. Actually, you can sit down with your foster parents and explain just what is keeping you from committing - their two eldest's behaviors and bullying. What are they going to do to interceded and stop or minimize these behaviors going forward.\n\nAre your foster parents willing to help you get into college or some type of apprenticeship training? Because that's a huge step up. To be fair to you, I think you need to be more forthcoming about your wants, dreams, desires, and roadblocks.\n\nSo, while not perfect, I think allowing the adoption is going to help you in your life. If the boys continue to make life difficult, you can avoid them after going to college. But having people at you back as you make it through those critical young adult years is important. \n\nI had a friend who adopted her son as well as having two biological children and he got through college and went no contact. I don't say you have to go to those extremes, but do what's best for you in the longterm.", "NTA\n\nYou have your reasons and this is your choice. sit down with your foster parents without their bio kids there and tell them the reason why you don't want to be adopted, they shouldn't be offended by the truth .\n\nRemember this is your life and your choice.", "NTA - My thought is that you should agree with the condition that you all get family therapy first to address your concerns. Either the issues get resolved, or they get a clear vision that there are issues and they work on them. Either way, you get therapy!", "NTA. I'm so sorry you're in foster care and you're having to walk on eggshells in the family you've been placed in. I think you should be honest with Bob and Lisa about why you don't want to be adopted and about what Bob's mom said to you. They're not doing great jobs as parents if they're not handling their sons' feelings and they didn't do a good job integrating you into the family. None of this is your fault and you should not have to suffer for it.", "INFO: Have you actually explained your reasons for not wanting to be adopted to your foster parents?", "NTA- Bob and Lisa should not be putting you in this position. They know their oldest two kids do not treat you well, and they're putting the choice of adoption on you when that's only going to make things worse. If you say yes you'll probably be treated worse by the brothers, but if you say no you're hurting Lisa and Bob and you'll have other family telling you that you're wrong. You can't win either way. You need to have a serious conversation with Bob and Lisa and explain that two of their sons are extremely cruel to you and have made it clear they do not like having you around. It's not fair of them to ask for adoption knowing this is the situation, and pushing adoption is likely to just make it worse. They need to address the behavior of the other two sons before even thinking about adopting. If you want to be adopted but are being held back due to the behavior of the boys you need to tell them that. But if you just don't want to be adopted that's okay to. And they should not make you feel guilty for that choice. It doesn't matter how kind they are to you, that doesn't mean they've somehow earned the right to adopt you if that's not what you want, or you think it will make your life harder.", "NTA, have you brought up all this with Bob and Lisa? About their bio kids treating you that way?", "Everyone I know has bio-siblings that they hate/hate them. If you are interested in being a part of a family you will likely experience sibling hatred. Luckily they are young that there is the possibility of friendship when they are older. \n\nIf I were you I would look into the legal differences between adoption vs continuing the foster relationship. Are the parents asking because there are grants or stipends available? Are there monetary incentives for you or them one way or the other? If you don\u2019t get adopted would you be welcome to stay with them past 18? Do some research, sit down with them, ask some questions. It may be mutually beneficial to go through an adoption and it may be best for you to remain unaffiliated (for lack of a better word sorry) but either way try to be informed and keep communication open.", "NTA\n\nYou should sit down with Bob & Lisa and discuss this. Let them know you appreciate that they took you in and that they want to adopt you, but also tell them the reason you have hesitation and you feel it will cause resentment from their children.\n\nOr....you could let them adopt you just to spite the brats.", "NTA. Sit down with Bob and Lisa and definitely tell them about what was said to you. Explain that the boys make you feel like you will never truly be a full member of the family. Tell them you like them and like living with them but you feel better not doing anything adoption.", "NAH.\n\nFirst of all it is 100% your choice.  It doesn't seem like you have a personal reason to be adopted or not.  Their other children don't want you to be adopted because it somehow pushes them out.  Grandma thinks you are ungrateful to refuse, but she doesn't understand why.\n\nI think you should accept, because in the long run there will be many benefits and even if it doesn't seem so now, eventually when you are adults your relationship with your brothers will improve.  And really they won't care about the adoption, except to be annoyed at all the fuss.\n\nBut either way you should tell your foster parents EXACTLY WHY you are hesitant.  That you don't want to make things worse with their other kids.", "NTA, not at all. I understand your hesitation.\n\nThe other piece of realism to consider is that many foster situations are very, very bad and I believe you know this because you don't want to be sent back out into the system. You, and every person, deserve a loving family and 100% acceptance. But sometimes we have to make a decision in imperfect situations trying to make the best imperfect decision. ou hesitate to be fully truthful for fear that you'll be sent somewhere else. Adoption will remove this fear always hanging over you.\n\nEven in bio families, there is jealousy and sibling relationships that don't gel. I think family therapy will help, to give the parents and everyone tools to manage the situation. I strongly recommend asking for it. It may or may not be 100% successful but there are no guarantees with anything.\n\nEditing to remove several repeating paragraphs.", "Nta but I think you should ask them to set up a meeting for you to talk to someone knowledgeable about what exactly being adopted would mean vs stay in care beyond just that you couldn't be moved to different home. A social worker, a lawyer, a foster charity volunteer, etc\n\nWhat benefits and resources YOU might lose out on and what would still be available if you were adopted. You want and deserve all the information written down in black and white to be able to make the best decision for you.\n\nThis is a really big decision for someone to make, especially when they are so vulnerable. I do think you need to consider that you can be taken out of that home at any point.  What were other foster homes like? Have you ever stayed in a group home? It's really hard to find people to take teens esp in your age group, you would most likely be put in a group home if removed. You might also have to switch schools. \n\nIf you aren't in therapy, then request to go to help you have the big conversations with your foster parents. I do think it's important that they know why you don't want to be adopted so they can attempt to fix things. (I dont understand why they haven't already done this. They do know their bio kids aren't happy with you being there or being adopted, and they know they don't treat you well). \n\nThat bobs mom spoke to you may mean that the extended families accept you more than you think, even though she could and should have been kinder about the conversation. (Did your foster parents foster other kids before you? It may be that you feel temporary and they don't want tongetvattatched when you can be quickly ripped away)\n\nI hope things turn out well for you and end up the way you want.", "NTA You don't sound ungrateful to me. You sound like you have a sound a reasonable point of view. Its wonderful that they have treated you well. But if you don't feel like part of the family the adoption isn't probably going to change that. You don't owe anyone anything. Even though I'm sure they are foster parents out of kindness and love, they also get compensated for their work so granny can stuff it. \n\nLike some other comments you should have a talk with them. Its possible Bob and Lisa do absolutely care about you as though you're a bio kid and they are just having difficulty expressing it properly. \n\nThey can still be in your life when you age out without being adopted.", "NTA but I would suggest being honest with the parents about why you don\u2019t want to be adopted.", "I think it's time to sit down with Bob and Lisa away from everyone else and have a real talk about your future. There may be reasons they want to legally solidify your relationship such as preventing your removal or making you a legal heir and there may be reasons it's in your best interests to age out such as housing assistance or scholarships.", "Bob\u2019s mom is TAH.\n\nI think you should talk to them. Tell them that you\u2019re happy there, but you worry that an adoption would upset the other kids.\n\nIf Bob and Lisa suggest that the kids would get used to it, you can tell them that you don\u2019t want to do that to the kids, and forcing it on them wouldn\u2019t help.\n\nThey truly seem to care for you, so I hope that being honest would work out, but I understand your reservations.", "I think you need to look into what programs and scholarships will be available to you for college. See if it is better for you to have parents with income when filling out grants or self supporting. Will you be covered under their health insurance while at college if they adopt you? I think it is important to consider financials and your future when you make this decision.", "NTA\n\nBut...\n\nBob and Lisa are adults, the oldest brother is just a 12 year old kid...\nIts normal for that to happen in their age because they are... kids...\n\nTo me it seems very much that its Lisa's dream to get a girl since there are only 3 boys atm, and she probably thought it through very well by now.\n\nBut the kids can think they hate u now, they probably will change their minds like 20 times until they grow up tho so its possible that they will totally regret not letting their own mom have their dream daughter when they grow up, i think they would feel very bad bc its mainly their fault atm.\n\nBut if you listen more to Bob and Lisa, and obviously only if u want to be adopted yourself, then you will make the right decision and the boys will understand it too when they get older.", "YTA and don't think you are. I understand that 16 you may think you have a good grasp on the world but there's a lot you don't get yet so take this from someone that has some miles, made bad choices, made good choices and is still trying to figure it all out. \n\nYou need to open up to Bob and Lisa and think about your future. Once you \"age out\" I doubt they'd want you out of their lives, which is why they want you apart of their family, legally. They want you to have a stable family and a home. It's a lot to ask children to like someone, its even harder if they're told too. Thier other kids may never come around and feel like siblings and you need to explain how you feel about them; you they make you feel to Bob and Lisa. I suggest you talk, even if its a hard talk that a 16 year old shouldn't have to have, let yourself have a second chance at a family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She and my next oldest cousin were 4 years apart in age and did not get along - to be honest, he doesn\u2019t get along with anyone.

Your foster siblings are scared, insecure kids and using shame to push you out of \"their\" family. Maybe later they will have a change of heat as they mature, but that won't happen if they are forced. Your foster grandparent is using shame to force you *into* \"their\" family. That just poisons your relationship with your foster parents into one of \"owing\" instead of one of love and appreciation. If your foster parents are willing to listen, tell them how both sides are using manipulation to try and force something and you don't want it either way, being put aside when you aren't their legal responsibility or forcing a closeness with kids who feel insecure & that you are an outsider. You appreciate the care and love they show you and if they want to continue once you \"age out\" they can choose to continue without the formality of an adoption.", "NTA.  If you have not already told them your reasons you need to let them know.  You can explain how grateful you are to them for providing a stable and safe home all these years.  But do explain that you don\u2019t feel true member of family because of bio kids behavior.  Also let them know that Bobs mother had a conversation with you and you want to express that you are not trying to be ungrateful but don\u2019t want to be put in a situation where you will be resented.", "NTA but I'd get adopted to take a portion of those kids' inheritance away when their parents are gone.", "NTA\n\nBut, you need to tell them the real reason why you are saying no.\n\nIt would seem they are tolerant of their sons (and your potential brothers) abusive behavior towards you.", "Speaking as an adopted child: no, you're not an AH for your feelings.  Bob's mom is the AH for thinking she has a right to be rude about how you feel.\n\nBeing a foster child is a whole different world, and you don't get over your experiences just because you finally have good people in your life.  The fact that their own boys remind you regularly that you aren't a blood relation only heightens your feelings of being the Other in the family, and that likely won't change either.  They're old enough to understand what their words mean, and while they may not understand the feelings (likely insecurity and jealousy) that those feelings are coming from, and you may be old enough to process their insecurities, it doesn't change how they feel and how they make you feel.\n\nMy suggestion is that you ask Bob and Lisa if the three of you can go out to dinner just the you three, because you want to discuss their generous offer in a private setting.  No other kids, no other relatives.  Then, tell them honestly about everything you feel and why.  Tell them what Bob's mother said to you and how that made you feel, and how you feel when the kids slur you.  Be completely honest - that you see and feel how they treat you differently, and that while you love them and love being in their family, you also know the kids don't see you that way.  They may not even realize they still treat you differently.\n\nIf you aren't sure you can handle saying everything out loud, you can try writing it down first?  So you can fully organize your thoughts and feelings, and review them, and then when the time comes just read it to them.\n\nI would ask if the boys are in therapy?  Charlie may be young enough that he literally believes if you were officially adopted, that means one of the current 'real' kids has to be kicked out.  I wouldn't rule out his brothers telling him that either - siblings can be terribly cruel without even realizing it.  The older boys would possibly think it was just funny to torture Charlie with such a threat, but he may actually believe it would happen.\n\nYou may need to ask your social worker if you can have a counseling session with Bob and Lisa so you can all talk through the problems with their idea, and also what it really means to you.  You're 16:  very few foster kids that age still believe that being adopted is even possible anymore, and they've come to terms with it.  Bob and Lisa may have ulterior motives for their desire to adopt that come from thinking you have very different expectations from them.\n\nAnyway, I hope you don't stress too much over this.  Honestly, Bob's mom would be a major reason to NOT be adopted - to avoid being permanently legally tied to that witch.  But trust me, we all have crap relations, whether blood or adopted or chosen or married into.  It's part of life.  Don't allow her nastiness to have even a grain of weight in your decision.  That should only be made based on your feelings, and what Bob and Lisa want, and what you feel in regards to your foster brothers and their expressed wants.  I would hedge that any adoption decision should hinge on the boys having counseling first, since that seems to be a BIG issue.  \n\nBut in the end, you are not beholden to what your foster parents want just because they've been willing to care for you.  Be true to yourself, but also give B&L credit for trying.  As long as you can explain that you are grateful and appreciative for what they've been able to give you, hopefully you can find a middle ground regarding the adoption idea that makes you all able to understand each other.  You may not be able to do what they want you to do, but as long as you can explain why while still respecting their feelings, you have done your very best.", "NTA  it is how you feel, and if you don't want to be adopted, that is your choice, and Bob's mom was way out of line.

It sounds like they don't do much to address it. I usually think it's great advice to communicate but OP is in a vulnerable position here and this situation won't improve if she points out the problem; they'll probably just feel attacked about their parenting, or like you're telling them their bio kids are the problem (they are, but I doubt their parents will want to hear that).\n\nNTA OP, the problem with situations like this is that the adults involved think they know what's best for you, and that you can't possibly know what's in your best interest because you're just a mixed up kid who's been in the system too long and doesn't know how to be loved. And if you don't go along with what they want, you get the attitude exemplified by Bob's mom: you're an ungrateful brat who doesn't appreciate everything they've done for you. And despite what I've seen a lot of other commenters say, that can easily turn into \"well if you don't want to be part of this family then maybe it's best we find another placement for you.\" Them wanting to adopt you does not mean that they unconditionally love you or love you as much as they do their bio kids, and it sounds like you already feel that separation.\n\nThis kind of difficult dynamic often isn't very fixable, and just as what happens with bio parents pretty often, you sometimes have to just find a way to work with what you have when you're dependent on them. To possibly get them to back off on adoption though, I'd frame it in terms of how you're trying to look out for the boys.\n\nExplain that the boys are continuing to struggle with what your place is the family is, and as much as you appreciate that Bob and Lisa do want to adopt you, you don't want to create resentment or a rift between them and their other children. Tell them that you'd love to be able to be an older sister and be there for the bio kids as they grow up, be able to give them advice and support etc, but that can only when the boys are ready for that, that it can't be forced, and that you just know in your heart that you'll be able to build that with them but you have to be patient to have that chance. You're worried that adoption will just worsen the situation between you and the kids or even between the kids and their parents.\n\nAssure them that you know how much they love you (even if you don't necessarily feel that way), and that adoption or no you do consider them your parents (even if you don't lol). Also assure them you're extremely grateful for all they've done and are doing for you, and you understand why they want this, but you also love your siblings (they'll probably love if you talk about their kids that way) and you want to do what's best for them too.\n\nI'm sure you've dealt with a lot of tough interpersonal situations in your life so far.

I doubt those boys will ever come around but once you're able to live somewhere else whether it's dorms or something else you won't need to deal with them so much if at all.\n\nGood luck OP, this just kind of sucks but I hope you can find a good solution and stay safe and as happy as you can be for now.\n\nEDIT: u/No-Magazine-4012 also makes a great point in another comment that aging out can make a huge difference with things like what resources/help/financial aid might be available to OP if they age out vs being adopted.

It's far from ideal, but it's also not that uncommon.", "I would tell bob and Lisa your concerns and have them sit down and have a talk with the boys. They need to find out why they treat you like this and find a solution to all of this. Even if you all decide not to go through with the adoption it\u2019s important to get to the bottom of these issues with their bio kids because obviously they\u2019re either feeling neglected by the fact of you being there or something else.", "Hey op I\u2019ve been where you are now, you know in your heart what you want, you want to be able to trust them but every experience in your life has made you fear trusting anyone for anything but if they really are as good of people as I believe you think they are, go against every instinct you have and trust them, they are offering you a support system past aging out, and as hard as foster care was when you turn 18 atleast for me, it got harder, way harder, being on my own in my little bubble I made knowing no one could hurt me if I didn\u2019t let them in but it took me too many years to realize no one could help me either and they want to be there for you and they are not asking anything of you, the other kids will mature and grow up one day and understand what you went through, just my two cents anyway, feel free to message me anytime if you need to talk about any of this stuff", "Have you thought about having your foster parents go through the post and comments and explain how uncomfortable you were about telling them directly, and if you aren't all the way for showing them with them knowing it's you, you could show them under the gise that you found the post and want their opinion on how they would feel if it was you before revealing it's yours after you've gotten a reaction/response? It could be something to think about. And as a former foster kid I feel the struggle of not wanting to be moved to another place but your safety, both physical and mental, is more important than foster parents who want to adopt just cuz and I have a feeling if you said yes without conversation and family therapy that the treatment would get worse. Just in the worst case please be ready to accept a new placement for your own safety. I hope it gets better and I wish I could help more than just some small bit of advice.", "dont mind the brats, do an 180, get adopted and be happy about it, if they bully u, tell them at least u were chosen", "The only reason you may want to consider it is so you have some support when you age out. I can't pretend to understand what it's like to be a foster kid but I also know many end up homeless at 18 because it's nearly impossible to completely support yourself without help at that age.", "You need to be upfront and honest with them, you really do.", "Mate, your 'brothers' are just dumb little kids. Who gives a shit if an 11 year old hates you?  They love and hate a bunch of stupid things. My brother and I were horrible to each other growing up. Fighting and beating the absolute shit out of each other. But now we are best of friends. We look back at the stupid shit we did when we were kids and laugh at just how dumb we were. They will grow out of it.", "This absolutely makes sense, but honey they really love you or they would never ask to adopt you! They care about your wellbeing and will try and help with the brothers. Also, I'm sure they have no idea why you don't want them as your legal parents, and blame themselves, do telling them the truth will be a gift to them.  Good luck!!", "NTA.  It sounds like you\u2019re handling a sensitive situation gently.", "This OP! Follow these talking points - they acknowledge all they have done for you, how thankful you are, and reinforces how much you care for them because you don't want to put strain on their relationship with their bio kids.", "OP, this is the way. I'm not a foster kid myself but for my entire childhood my mom was a social worker and I've known and been close with a ton of foster kids (some of whom are still good friends over 30 years later). Please don't believe the commenters who say screw the angry kids and get yourself adopted. Their resentment WON'T change and all that will happen is that it will create a you vs. them situation and ultimately you will lose. At the end of the day, who knows what their true motivation for adopting you is, especially since they still make a clear difference between how they treat you vs their bio kids, and don't stop the boys from antagonizing you. If they really love you, they won't press about this and you can decide later whether to keep them in your life or not.", "Oh my god please. All of these three kids are under 13. She is in no danger.", "Also, think about the fact that adoption is relatively permanent so they will *be* your parents even after you turn 18. \n\nThe question isn't, \"Should I let them adopt me since it's only 2 years until I'm an adult?\" The question is, Do you want them to be a part of your life after you turn 18?\" They can be helpful with college and getting started in life but, they will still have some control. Do you *like* the parents enough to stick around? \n\nThis is about how you want to live the next 6-10 years of your life. Do you want them to be a part of it or not? NTA", "Most foster youth are entitled to aid if they spent some of their adolescence in foster care, even if they get adopted.", "It depends on the state. In my state there are grants available for people 18- 22 who have aged out of foster care or have been adopted out of the system.", "If they're rich, being adopted as a child instead of as an adult could be invaluable in any later inheritance dispute.", ">  and will have a LOT more resources available to help her financially than if she has legal parents.\n\nI'm not 100% sure, but have seen some things saying that those adopted as teens are still counted as emancipated for FAFSA. Might be worth a little more research or a conversation with her social worker and/or school counselors.", "That's a good point to bring up to Bob and Lisa, if she's afraid of telling them about the bullying. It sounds like this is a better home than ones she was in before, so if she mentions college and how not being adopted will help provide her with financial aid, they may drop it. It's not perfect, I know, but once she finishes college and feels safer op can speak to Bob and Lisa about everything. Maybe with a family therapist?", "This was my thought. I don\u2019t know much about foster care, but I do know that there are significant downsides to adopting so close to 18 compared to the funds available and the programs in place to help foster kids get accepted and succeed in college.\n\nOP needs to look out for themselves first.", "Bob and Lisa are also very likely being paid 300-600$ pet month for caring for OP.  They stop getting that money if they adopt her, so I assume money isn't an issue for them.  Hopefully they already been putting away all or a portion of that money for OPs college.  Also at least in TX anyone that spent any time in foster care is eligible has their tuition fully covered at any Public college in the state", "> The strategic thing to do is wait until 18, and, if they want to do an adult adoption after OP finishes college, that is still possible.\n\nAnd by framing it this way to the foster parents, OP gets time - and so do the foster brothers, who... well, clearly there's a lot going on there.", "I just checked, in my state, an adoption would negate the tuition and fee waiver offered to foster children.\n\nHowever, this covers only tuition and fees - it wouldn't cover room & board or books (although filling out the FAFSA would pretty much guarantee Pell grants and other assistance). I know because I was granted a state scholars award that covered - tuition and fees, there were still several thousands left that other scholarships, grants, and aid had to cover.", ">They know the older boys don\u2019t like me but they say they\u2019ll come around.\n\nWhy don't you just tell them that you'll be open to the idea once this happens?", "Do they understand the level of uncertainty you feel.  I  believe they think that by adopting you they are showing that you are wanted and secure.  That\u2019s not what you are perceiving.  Understandably you are in a continuous survival mode.  Not sure how you feel about sharing that with them.  My advise do share your concerns and work with them as how you can feel secure.   They wanting to adopt you is not doing it.", "I have no clue if this is an option, but what if you would suggest to be adopted when you are 18? I\u2019m sorry for your situation, you are making the best of it and I\u2019m rooting for you to get a scholarship.", "Just so you know there IS a good ending coming for you no matter what happens on this decision. Even if you age out, have to deal with another group home or family, or are adopted. You still get to move on with your own life in 2 years. You get to decide where you live and go from there on. You get to pick your friends and/a partner or spouse and build a family for yourself- whatever that looks like to make you happy. You still get to pick all of that. \nLife is always gonna be have problems and be hard. But you get to live it. So dig in and find the things that you want for yourself and go get it. \nYour NTA no matter what you decide here. Your just a kid in a crappy situation. And as someone who was in your position- it's gonna be ok \ud83d\udc4d", "Do you have any evidence to support your fear that they will kick you out, or is it more of an irrational fear based on your past experiences?", "Would you get more aid for college as a foster child?\n\nIf so, can you phrase it that way? \"I really appreciate that you two want to adopt me, but that would put the burden of my college on you or reduce the amount of aid I can get because your salaries will be counted. Add that in to the fact that 12 and 11 still don't like me and I think it's best if we don't proceed with an adoption right now, but adult adoption is a thing, so if you still feel this way in a few years and the boys have adjusted to me and don't object anymore, I'd be thrilled to do it at that point.\"", "And be sure to reassure Bob and Lisa that you like them and want to stay, you just aren't sure that adoption is the best thing to do right now.", "I don't think that them not being \"smart enough\" is the problem. I think it's that they can't read minds. \n\nOP, please correct me if I'm wrong, but in my experience, people who bully and ostracize like this tend to only do it when other people aren't around. Bob's mother waited until she was alone with OP to spew her hateful garbage. Odds are that the older 2 boys also only do it when their parents aren't around. \n\nOP, you need to tell Bob and Lisa what's going on. It sounds like they care deeply about you, and they probably think that they've done something wrong for you not to want to be a legal part of their family after being with them for 4 years. I promise you they want to help you, and they can only help if they have all the facts.", "OOOHH -- good point. \n\nIt could be the boys have not come around because of granny.", "This.  Kids that age generally don't react like that unless someone is in their ear.", "This is good advice.. everyone needs support from someone going forward, and as a teen, you don't realise how much harder life as an adult is.. \nAs others have said, the boys may mature and realise for themselves, they may not, they may always hate you..\nBut this is a them problem, not you, you deserve love and blood does not make family", "I really have to disagree. OP says that *they know* how their sons feel and they are still going against those kids' wishes in respect to OP. That's horrible parenting and is sure to deepen the divides that already exist. OP actually has more wisdom than her parents do, here.", "Nah, then she'll have to deal with this shit for the rest of her life.", "You're horrid.", "Yes bc assault, physical/mental/sexual, never happen to anyone under 13 and could never be committed by someone under 13 . . . Fucking grow up.", "And if they are, that needs to be made into a solid legally binding contract with the court's approval and blessings.  Otherwise it's a far better from a financial and practical pov to \"age out\" making sure one has been a pita to their social worker enough that the social worker does their job and facilitates connecting their charge with the proper resources, and college opportunities. This is why my foster parents didn't adopt me until much later as an adult adoption. They and I understood the system likes to push unwanted/unready adoptions on kids just to wipe their hands of us in that life's lot.", "I was wondering if a college fund is one of the ways that Bob & Linda 'treat her differently' that the boys keep throwing in her face.", "Idk about all states, but I've adopted a child from foster care in texas and know from that process that any child that spends even 1 day in the states custody through CPS can go to any state college with their tuition 100% covered by the state.", "Idk about all states but in Texas any child that has spent time as a foster child for any amount of time can go to college with their tuition covered by the state.  In fact the foster parents are currently being paid by the state to care for OP, once adopted they stop getting that money.  Lawyers are often used in the process costing money as well.", "Happens to kids all the time.  If you don\u2019t give the fosters what they want, they\u2019ll move on to someone who will because there\u2019s always more where you came from. Even if they\u2019re really nice, all it takes is one bad day when they\u2019re having a bad day and you\u2019re back in the system.  Happened to me before and pretty much every kid in the system I know. There\u2019s nothing you can do about it, if you find a good place you have to do whatever to stay there because you might get raped or beaten at the next place. Maybe Bob and Lisa wouldn\u2019t drop me, but maybe they would and there\u2019s no way to know until it happens.", "The boys are pretty open about hating me, they don\u2019t hide it at all. Bob\u2019s mom has made comments in front of them before but this was the first time she\u2019s been really pointed about it.", "Why are we talking about assault? You fucking people in this sub always go to the extreme despite Op not saying a single word about anything like that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou should stop jumping to conclusions, and telling someone else to grow up... what a joke.", "Well she didn\u2019t say that, but let\u2019s assume for fun!", "That may apply in this case, too, but it would be best for OP to talk with local experts who know the facts on the ground.", "This is such a stressful way to live a life. \nYou're giving up on too much and trying to bear too much alone. And all that because of two brats who have everything. \n\nIt's your life we are talking about here, even between members of the same family we get to *choose* the people we want to socialize with. We get to cut ties with family members who only bring toxicity in our lives. \n\nDo you think you could try to give the two kids a little more time to maybe change? Then you can see your options.\n\nYou say you can see that your foster parents don't treat you the same as their kids, but it's only normal. There are things they can't do for you in your situation right now. Things they can't enforce. If you become their child that attitude is certainly going to shift because now they will have to give you the place they promised you. The rest is a problem of *parenting* and it's NOT your problem. You're still a kid even if you're older than them, you're not supposed to put up with that. \n\nAlso you don't need to be at home to be their kid. You are already 16, if you start to take a part time job and save money you can get your own apartment quite soon, especially if your new parents decide to support you. \n\nThen in the case the two brats didn't change you can just get out to avoid them and continue to enjoy your relation with their parents.\nIt will be a relation between adults on a totally different level you will be able to detach yourself from them. At least till they change.\n\nDon't put all these barriers around you, you know you don't want to be alone. Try to rely on Bob and Liza a little more, try to trust them a little more, and the same for your counselor too.  You're so scared it's like you're closing your eyes, your heart, everything.\nBut your councellor is  *paid* to help you, and sincerely, they are seeing a lot of other children too, so  I'm pretty sure they know something isn't quite well.\n\nDo you really think that they wil suddenly decide to displace you if you said that you're hesitating because you think the two kids hate you? Or maybe there is more to the story? Are they bullying you? Is it why you're so afraid of opening to someone? \nIt's such a shame to see someone like you who deserves to be happy like anyone else, be so afraid of a new, *rare* chance because of too little pests who still know *nothing* about life.\n\nYou know, if you get adopted you're going to change too, you'll be able to rebuild yourself on new and better bases you can choose, this time.\n\nThat's what I did when I escaped from my abusive parents. I cut all ties, immigrated to another country and completely rebuild myself. Suddenly everything was much clearer. Also, it was insanely fun and so very therapeutic.\n\nI hope you'll manage to grab that chance too.\n\nI wish you all the luck and happiness in the world.", "I am sorry to hear that! I am from a different country and did\u2019t know that the foster system is THAT horrible. As a mother it\u2019s unbelievable how could do that to your children, don\u2019t matter if they\u2019re your blood, chosen or adopted. I hope that one day you can feel happy and safe, no matter how you decide <3", "I think that's a reasonable fear. I'm not sure if telling them why is in your best interest considering you are currently somewhere stable and safe. \nThere is some good advice in this thread but I can also see some people don't understand the genuine risks of foster care.\n\nI guess just try and determine if it's more valuable for your future to be adopted by them or not. If you think they'll financially support you or if you think you would get more funding alone.\n\nOnce you're over 18 you don't have to speak to their bio kids, even if you do keep in touch with them.", "I would really just urge you to tell the truth to Bob and Lisa about the way the other members of the family have been treating you. Either they'll listen and things will be better, or they won't, in which case they're not fit to call themselves your parents in the first place.", "Please be completely honest with Bob and Lisa. Tell them everything you\u2019ve written here. Maybe show them the post. Gramma sounds like a nasty sort and I don\u2019t blame you for wanting to be in a family with boys who are allowed to treat you this way. Good luck. You deserve so much more than being made to feel unwanted and uncomfortable. NTA", "You mentioned that Bob and Lisa treat you different than their bio kids, how so? If they treat you  differently why would they want to adopt  you?", "Perhaps Bob and Lisa are dismissing their sons' behavior as normal sibling rivalry and nothing to be concerned about. If that's the case, they're totally wrong and they need to address it if they really care about you.", "Compliment sandwich. \n\n\u201cBob, Lisa, I really like you both and want to keep living with you. I also feel your bio kids still hate me and it would cause more issues if you adopted me.

I study really hard and get good grades but it\u2019s a way bigger deal if the boys get good grades when it\u2019s just like \u201cgood for you keep it up\u201d to me.
