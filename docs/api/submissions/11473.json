In this post, you've called your professor awful and judgmental. You've assumed his criticism is because you are wealthy, rather than that it's motivated by experience, and perhaps even wisdom. \n\n  \nWhen you start getting clients, it won't serve them or you well to do so much projection and imagineering about their mental landscape, especially if it's not in good faith.", "YTA", "YTA and I agree with the professor. What he said was exactly true and it\u2019s the type of education that you won\u2019t get from a book. You should be soaking it up.", "YTA I was going for E S H but given your subsequent responses I think your teacher may have seen some red flags in things you say and was trying to combat that. From what you described at worst he was insensitive in the way he did it, attack is an inappropriate term for the interaction you described. You may have felt attacked but he did not attack you, important distinction. I\u2019m from the UK so it may be different in America but here using words like common to describe lower income education options is frankly horrid. If I heard a mental health professional use it I would be very concerned about their judgment in general and especially how they view people.", "I don\u2019t even care that this post has to be fake. It is the funniest thing I have read in weeks. YTA just in case this is real.", "Kinda YTA,he didn't say you wouldn't do well in your future career because you're wealthy. He didn't say that at all. So your report is false. Your professor is right tho.", "YTA. Some friendly advice from a professional crisis counselor, it is super important to acknowledge your privilege in this field, clients come from all walks of life and they won\u2019t want someone who can\u2019t understand their situation. For example, if someone is telling you about their anxiety caused by financial struggles, but they know you\u2019ve never had such struggles, they\u2019re going to have a much harder time communicating that with you. Your professor was trying to teach you, he isn\u2019t the AH for that, jobs in mental health are NOT easy, and people who aren\u2019t prepared for those hardships tend not to last very long in the field.", "YTA", "lol it isn't your professor's place to teach you? What do you think school is for? What's the point of getting a fancy, expensive education if you aren't willing to learn? It's clear that this type of education is just a bragging right for you rather than a chance for you to expand your mind and see the world outside your own perspective.\n\nAnd everything your professor said is correct. You will not be a good counselor if you aren't willing to see past your privilege and stop bragging. You aren't special because your parents have money. You aren't special because you get to go to a fancy school.... That isn't something you earned. There are so many people who could get into and be successful in a T20 school that can't go because they can't afford it. \n\nYou are in for a rude awakening if you go into counseling because it'll take you out of your rich kid bubble and no one will think you're special because daddy inherited money.\n\nedit: forgot to include YTA", "I have never been a therapeutic - but I have been am executive that had thousands of employees through my career.

It stinks of privilege and you will never relate to anyone. You can\u2019t even relate with people here. Has no one ever told you no or that you weren\u2019t special?  YTA", "YTA. Why does he even know those things? Obviously because you've been bragging about them and he's 100% right. People won't relate to you. I wouldn't relate to you.  Maybe instead of being a tattle tale you should listen to your professor.", "what i got from OPs post was that the professor was just trying to bring awareness to OP to be conscious of what wording they use and how they present themselves to patients in order to present a neutral playing field and make their patients feel comfortable.\n\nwhat i got from OPs replies is OP doesnt know *how to* or *want to* listen to others which is a key skill to have as a counselor.\n\n whats the point of going to the best schools if you arent going to listen and take advice from the highly recognized people i am assuming they hire.", "YTA.\n\nHoney, pull the silver spoon out of your ass.

I work in the trauma field and clients do care their practitioner has humility, depth and has navigated their own personal struggles, and knows what it takes to grow and change as a person. You cannot lead anyone through places you haven\u2019t navigated yourself. The first bit of feedback you didn\u2019t like you REPORTED your professor. Not a conversation but an official report. You do sound privileged and entitled and the fact your mother backed you up confirms that you perhaps are. Also there is so much more to therapeutic talent and ability then talking to a few mates in Highschool who had depression.", "Yes YTA for reporting him. He's correct, and he's offering some personal insight, which is above and beyond his job. This is valuable, and your strong reaction means it's literally a great lesson.", "YTA.

As someone who works successfully in that field, specifically in MH crisis, this will be a barrier between you and your future clients. You aren\u2019t there to save anyone, you are there to empower people to make positive choices. At this point, unless you learn from this and drop your privilege, you will not be successful in this field and will actually be harming anyone you work with. \n\nAs someone who attends therapy, I would drop you after one session if you talked like this to me and tell all my friends not to see you.", "YTA. You are going to have a hard time in this field if you can\u2019t self reflect and see things from another perspective. You won\u2019t be able to help anyone but the most privileged with that type of reaction. Your professor was trying to get you to think about how you will explain yourself to those that aren\u2019t as fortunate. Your reaction was to report them. Not to reflect, not to contemplate. You ran to your wealthy parents, told your side, got confirmation, moved on to complain.", "YTA. Just for that name alone", "YTA- The professor isn\u2019t judge, but as a counselor, if your clients aren\u2019t comfortable with you, then you\u2019re the problem. Like if I went to a white counselor and I decided to talk about the numerous racial discriminatory practices I\u2019ve come across while dealing with medical issues that could have killed me, and they decided to talk about their time at an HBCU and how they got called \u201c Mayo King\u201d I\u2019m leaving midsession and finding a new practice.", "YTA and only reason your upset is because he\u2019s right.

Your comments alone show how much of a rude awakening you are in for.  This isn't a field you go into for prestige. You go into it to meet people where they are and walk alongside them in the midst of life.   He didn\u2019t overstep at all, also clients don't give a crap about where you went to school. \n\nI honestly hope you get over the entitlement or reconsider this line of work.  It isn't about you and it never will be. It is about the clients.", "YTA and a snob. You are going into counseling for self aggrandizement, which will probably make you a shit therapist. If you can\u2019t relate to all kinds of people, you won\u2019t be able to help them. Being a counselor isn\u2019t about you, it\u2019s about patients. Your professor is trying to help you realize these things. You reporting him just proves what he was saying- you don\u2019t know how to relate to people who don\u2019t think like you.", "YTA\n\nHe called out your bragging and a bit of a saviour complex. He said nothing about wealth. You have reported a teacher for providing a taching moment", "It's quite ironic that you proved your professor right in that your privilege would get in your way. \n\nYTA.  I went to grad school for Marriage & Family Counseling with people like you. The ones that thought that doing some hand-holding for friends with depression was akin to having the personality and character to actually be effective as mental health professionals.  Hate to break it to you, Scooter, but they were the LEAST effective, and years later they ended up leaving the profession.  \n\nAnd THIS killed me: \n\n>I said it wasn't his place to teach us this.\n\nIt is ABSOLUTELY his place to teach you this. Further, he would be doing you (and any potential future clients) a disservice by not teaching you this. \n\nGet off your entitled high horse and stop pitching fits whenever someone tells you a hard truth.", "YTA\n\nMasters of Social Work student here.  I also come from a very privileged background (I'm white and middle-class), so I make it a point to understand how that impacts the clients I interact with.  Your professor is right.  Counseling is more than just \"making people with depression feel better\".  It's getting to know the client, focusing on where they come from, listening to the way they want themselves or their environment to change, helping them in the way they want/need, and sometimes, even challenging them when they do acts that are harmful to themselves and/or others.  We cannot challenge them or ask them to be introspective of themselves, if we are also not practicing that.  \n\nYou mention in a comment how you want a nice education for respect?  You only earn respect when you respect your clients.  Calling certain schools common or making a username like that (even as a joke), does show respect to the people you're supposed to serve.  And your \"high-end\" education does no good if you're not using it to grow yourself.  \n\nRecognize your privilege, challenge yourself, and learn to respect those who are vastly different from you if you want to be a counselor.", "YTA, plus entitled as hell. You reported him because he dared give you perfectly accurate advice?  \n\nYour boyfriend is a lot smarter than you are.", "YTA, and actually proved him correct when you couldn't understand the lesson. I don't think you're meant to help people.", "YTA. \n\nAnd going to a top school doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to be a great counselor.

Bragging about your education is not cool!", "YTA He's telling you the truth about your future career, you're going to hear things that will give you nightmares. And he's also right about being empathetic to other's circumstances. You are getting a great education, but you only want the parts that you think you should be getting - if you don't learn how to react to situations, how will you cope with your first really combative client? You've got a lot of learning, and a lot of growing up to do", "NTA. Your professor is partly right but mostly wrong. When I did my fellowship, I was looked down on by my attending anesthesiologists and surgeons because I did medical school and residency in Ivy league schools. They thought I was going to be stuck up. That lasted a month and now no one cares where I went to school. They care that I do the job well. That will happen to you. If you are a caring counselor, your patients aren't going to care where you graduate. And the ones who do are going to appreciate you graduating from a good school.", "He didn't imply you won't do well because of your wealth but because you seen to be unaware you've had privileges. There is nothing bad in being wealthy or having privileges as long as we recognize them as such and remember where do we stand and how that affects our perspective. As a counselor you'll have to put yourself into many different perspectives knowing not everyone had your same paths. This could have been the first lesson in learning to put yourself into different shoes  but you decided to just go against it so YTA. \nIt's fine, we all do mistakes but if you don't start realising you have to be less hurt by critics you'll have a hard path no matter what you do.", "He didn't tell you you wouldn't do well because of your wealth. And he makes a valid point.  You sound very full of yourself. Very full of yourself.\n\nYou need to recognize your privilege and realize that not all people will respond well to you.\n\nYTA", "YTA  he was trying to get you to think about how you might approach a discussion with someone from a different background, this is just getting you to think critically about how your life experience differs from others and new approaches you may need to consider, standard for anyone working and teaching in this field", "Actually I don\u2019t read this as disrespectful or discouraging you about your career choice. It sounds like you should learn to talk differently about it your privileged background yes, I said it, privileged. It\u2019s okay, good for you for getting a great education, there is no problem with that. But if you sound like you are bragging about it to people with significantly less chances in life you will probably have difficulties. Therefore you need to learn how to talk about it. \n\nIt\u2019s about how you present yourself, not about who you are. I change my vocabulary depending on the audience. Because I want them to understand me and I don\u2019t want to come off as snobby. That\u2019s what you need to learn. And your professor tried to tell you. Learn the lesson. \n\nYTA. I hope the professor will not suffer from giving a student much needed advice", "Yta And it\u2019s hilarious that you don\u2019t think so.", "YTA. You need to grow up and think about how much privilege you have had in your life. You come across as very sheltered. You reported a professor who was simply trying to help you?  Good luck finding a boss who won\u2019t critique your work.", "YTA, but I feel badly for you because you  sound very young, ego-centric, and naive. I hope you gain more life experience and learn some humility in the next few years, because I think your heart is in the right place. Truly wishing you all the best, but please learn how to take constructive criticism, because the real world will not kiss your ass just because you are rich and have a great education. Your background does not make you better than anyone else, and the sooner you learn that, the better..", "YTA, OP, and you\u2019re pretty much proving his point. Reporting him absolutely reeks of privilege. Part of the application process for the program I\u2019m in was a separate essay on whether/why diversity in the field of psychological counseling is important. And my assertion was that yes, it is, because diversity can only strengthen the profession by providing far more perspectives and insights, and gives prospective clients options better tailored to their needs. Diversity in race, culture, religion, sexuality, socioeconomic background, etc. can all be important when it comes to the relationship between client and therapist. It\u2019s not necessarily my style, but many clients do benefit from their therapist opening up at least a little bit and sharing something back. It makes them feel more comfortable. If a patient feels you are incapable of truly understanding them, they\u2019re just not going to open up on certain subjects. Some factors you can\u2019t change, like your skin color, but others you can, such as *how* you present yourself. Your professor was absolutely correct in pointing out that boasting about getting into a prestigious (and expensive) institution has the potential to alienate certain clients. Think about how some politicians smear opponents as out-of-touch, elitist academics from Ivy League schools. They do so because they\u2019re tapping into a resentment held by their base; do you think you can effectively engage with one of those people, say, a dairy farmer experiencing suicidal ideation because he\u2019s going to lose his farm, if the way you\u2019re presenting yourself comes off to them as out-of-touch with their lived experiences?", "HAHA YTA. If you think this was judgy, get ready for the medical health world", "YTA, change your career, you shouldn\u2019t help people.\nBy reporting him, you have proven his point.", "ESH - your professor does have a point and it's hard to appreciate until you do get into the field, however he may well have gone about it in the wrong way: rather than supporting and guiding you to see an alternative viewpoint, he seems to have shot your confidence down, and it wasn't very nice to do it in front of the group. I had a manager do a similar thing while I was in training to become a casework support officer and it was really disheartening so I can appreciate where you're coming from", "YTA but let me explain why\u2026\n\nSame background actually. Dad owned a company/Mom was head of QC for clinical trials. Private school whole life. I worked at a graduate school of social work for a T20 school for 8 years. My sister is a psychologist.\n\nThe one thing LCSWs, LMSWs, DSWs, and LPCs don\u2019t get taught, that every other mental health professional is taught and must do before they graduate with a PhD, is to clean out your own house before helping others. After working with social workers, soon to be social workers and hosting their credit events, I learned about about the toll it takes on them to listen to traumatic issues every day all day. It takes a huge amount of emotional intelligence to disassociate from every work day. Otherwise, your gage of emotional responses will be skewed.\n\nWhen you professor confronted you, he was helping you reflect. Granted, he may not have approached you right. I\u2019ll give you that. The healthy approach and the standard policy of schools and business would be for you to speak with that person first. If the problem persists, then you report.\n\nYou skipped a step because you were uncomfortable. You may not have been comfortable but one of the things they teach is having uncomfortable conversations. \n\nI realize I may get flack for this but as someone who has received these types of reports/complaints, my first question would be if you spoke to the professor directly. \n\nIt sucks when we get called out but it happens and you won\u2019t always have a way to report the person.\n\nHe may get a talking to but that is probably it. You might get an apology but he is probably thinking the same things I typed above.\n\nGood luck. We need more of you, I just wish they taught more self healing before releasing y\u2019all into the wild.", "YTA He gave you very good advice on how to make yourself more relatable to future clients. By reporting him, all you did was show how out of touch you are and that you will need to work on your social intelligence to be successful.", "Your professor was right & the fact you can't understand it makes me wonder if you are capable of learning anything, or if this expensive education is wasted on you. But reporting them makes YTA. \n\nAlthough I suspect the staff & administration will get a good chuckle out of it, in all honestly.  This is so ridiculous, it's hard to believe it's real.", "YTA", "\u201cWait till my father hears about this\u201d comes to mind", "YTA\n\nIf you\u2019re unable to professionally handle and take to heart a professor\u2019s justified critique of your attitude, you have absolutely no business in the mental health field. Having friends that came to you with their issues in high school means absolutely nothing. The school you go to? Means nothing. \n\nIf you\u2019re so worried about the status that the name of your school brings you, become a business major and go work for daddy\u2019s business. At least then you\u2019ll be with like-minded company.", "YTA. Your professor wasn\u2019t saying you wouldn\u2019t do well because you are rich, he was pointing out that you talking about being rich and having a prestigious education might make people from different backgrounds feel uncomfortable confiding in you as they may see that as a claim you are superior to them. You need to learn to listen better if you want to become a councillor.", "[removed]", "Oh man you wouldn't last a second in graduate school. Grow some thicker skin. Your professor is completely right. You wouldn't have any personal experience to draw upon. YTA", "YTA. I hope you are never my counselor, or anyone\u2019s counselor with that attitude. I went through a few addiction counselors for my drinking. They all had degrees from prestigious universities and didn\u2019t do shit for me. They didn\u2019t try to relate to me. They just repeated the same lines they got from their college textbooks. The one who got me to finally quit had no degrees hanging up nor did he brag about his education. He was an addict himself and was able to relate to my own addiction. (He did go to a prestigious university, but didn\u2019t make it his selling point). \n\nI\u2019m not saying you have to have mental health or addiction issues to treat other\u2019s problems. But you need to relate to the person seeking help. Your professor is literally teaching you how to be a counselor and you\u2019re discrediting him when he gave you legitimately good advice. He wasn\u2019t even saying you won\u2019t make it because of your background. He was saying you need to step back and see your client\u2019s from their points of view. Poverty and lack of government resources is directly related to higher rates of mental health disorders. If you come in and think that your high cost education is all you need to be a counselor, you will be a terrible counselor.", "On what grounds did you report him on? He gave you advice that your statements can come across as pretentious and \"holier than thou\" and may turn clients offs - Nothing about that states you *shouldn't* go into the given career path. If anything, he's trying to help you not burn bridges later in your career. Stating that you can \"make everyone feel comfortable\" seems to validate his point. You've lived a privileged life, and that is going to limit how much you can relate to others without further experience. If you can't listen to a professor with a different viewpoint without taking offense, how are you going to deal with clients from an entirely different lifestyle? \n\nYTA", "Helping your rich depressed friends isnt what counseling is. Also theres noone to tattle to in the real world. Grow up", "Also your bf is right. And you really showed out on your privilege reporting him. Maybe you should take a sociology class \u2026quite a few actually", "YTA and ughhhh as a mental health clinician with 15+ years in the profession it makes me sad and nervous to know that you are the future of the field if you don\u2019t pull your head out of your ass and listen to those who came before you.", "YTA. I\u2019m a therapist and your professor is right, you do need to be mindful.

It is just a reminder that those who are unemployed, in debt, make barely any money, or who are uneducated are indeed missing out on what you have. I am not saying you WOULD say that to a client/patient - but your professor seems to be just trying to help by reminding you to be careful how you word things such as this.

I might question them about how they thought their background would help them, relate to their clients, but saying that patients want someone they can relate to is telling the OP that their background is negative. seriously anyone who becomes a counselor has spent the time and money to go to graduate school so they\u2019re already privileged to matter what school they went to.

What mattered to me was knowing that they had walked through hard times too and had come out the other side. Also that I could build a rapport with them. I can usually tell when a mental health professional is just telling me things they\u2019ve learned about in a book and not with lived experience and I don\u2019t want to open up them.", "That's actually not realistic at all. You may have had more opportunities due to financial reasons, however, that does not equal better advice. If anything it's a very narrow viewpoint with a complete lack of understanding of how 95% of the world lives. Im not saying you'll be a bad counsellor but stop convincing yourself that this prestigious school is going to give you a leg up with your clients, it won't. Maybe with the people hiring you but those who you claim to want to help will not care. If anything they will likely resent you and/or think you're completely unrelatable.", "I have never checked my therapist\u2019s education. I don\u2019t care what school you came from, they all learn from the same books. I want someone I feel comfortable with and can open up to and you would definitely not be the one. With that attitude, I wouldn\u2019t even pay for our first session. You suck.", "No. I don\u2019t think any of that makes you have better \u201cadvice\u201d. JFC.", "Well you got advice from a professor at a T20 university, thought it was bad and reported him so you are living proof that not everyone values top school education\u2026.", "Even if this were true (it's not), how are you getting a better education if you're not accepting feedback from the people teaching you at your prestigious school?", "I would rather have a counselor who knows how to connect with people and not make it about them and their privilege.", "See, here's the thing; a better education doesn't mean you've learned more or better stuff. \n\nSomeone could go to Harvard and pass all their classes and still be an unempathetic AHole with a gigantic head. \n\nSomeone could attend the top university in the world and it could be driven by the student's love of prestige, not love of the people they want to help. \n\nAnd when you're meeting with a counselor you want someone who understands you where you are and who can connect and help in a way that you can appreciate, not some pompous twit who thinks a good education is the same as real empathy coupled with an average education.\n\nAnd all your tone deaf comments only prove that you're not interested in really listening and understanding and helping, you're more interested in being listened to and understood and being thanked for your help.", "I have no idea where my therapist went to school. All I know is that she has helped me so much over the years, and that I\u2019m very grateful for her empathy and the experiences that allowed her to help me. My opinion definitely wouldn\u2019t change if I learned she didn\u2019t go to a prestigious school.", "Better advice comes from overcoming and relating, not just education.", "I want someone I can connect with. Someone who\u2019s also had hard times and suffered some. If you\u2019ve never dealt with mental health issues or money issues or anything then it\u2019s hard to take your advice seriously.", "Wouldn\u2019t you want to see someone with a better education\n\nA \u201cbetter\u201d education won\u2019t make you a better therapist.  If you lack the critical skills needed to be a therapist, such as self-awareness, empathy and compassion for vulnerable people, no amount of education will make you a \u201cbetter therapist\u201d.\n\nand therefore better advice\n\nSee, this is wrong again.  As a therapist, you aren\u2019t suppose to \u201cgive advice\u201d.  Your job is to help people walk through stages of change so they can reach their full potential.  It\u2019s about them, it\u2019s not about you.", "Actually you\u2019re incredibly off base. You have zero real life experience that isn\u2019t coddling. Get a grip.", "What school you went to (which is heavily based on privilege) will not matter once you're out in the field.\n\nYour clients don't give a shit if you went to Harvard, Yale or to local state school. What your clients want is someone *real*, who can truly empathise and speak with connection with them.\n\nAll you're doing (with your horrific name and bragging here) is just showing how out of touch you are. And having been the 'mental savior' to your high school buddies is zero litmus test for being a good, capable counselor, psychiatrist or psychologist out in the field.\n\nYou're so immature but so egotistical.", "Not if they have this kind of attitude, and I come from a wealthy family. You think you are better than other people because of where you go to school and they should automatically respect you for it. That\u2019s not how the real world works.", "Someone from a \"lesser\" school can easily surpass you in every way simply by understanding what others need, which you completely fail to do.", "No. Counseling isn\u2019t about how \u201cprestigious\u201d your education is. It\u2019s about who you are and how you apply your knowledge to help someone else. \n\nEducation is barely a stepping stone in the field you\u2019ve chosen. What really makes you worthwhile is your experiences. And those don\u2019t come from where you went to school. You won\u2019t get any form of internship or shadowing opportunities with elitist privilege like you\u2019re displaying here.", "Absolutely not \ud83d\ude02", "I think this is where the issue lies - across this post and in your replies. Your sense of self and intentions don\u2019t translate well to those outside your current circle of influence. \n\nYears back, I dealt with a lot of depression internalized stigma before mental health advocacy was a thing (in particular, I thought getting additional tools meant I was weak for not solving my own issues). Having a mental health professional thinking I needed saving would have made make me stop seeking resources immediately. Heck, I stopped seeking treatment for a few months because I ran into a councilor who thought they knew everything. \n\nWhat I needed most was for someone to listen and see me as a unique, complex person. And I at last found that when I was at my lowest point (luckily). This is why people here don\u2019t care about your background, upbringing, or education. They care about the empathy of your words and ability to listen. \n\nI hope you are able to understand and reflect on what people are saying in this thread. THESE are the people who may one day sit in your office for an initial evaluation.", "Your hubris is so telling.", "It makes you sound like an insufferable arrogant sort of person.

The supreme arrogance of your position it's mind boggling.", "I doubt it was a joke OP", "Guys I\u2019m not tech savvy and don\u2019t have social media so somebody please put this on that TIKTOK.", "Absolutely. It\u2019s why women often want to see women counselors, LGBTQ want to see LGBTQ counselors, POC want to see POC counselors. You often would like someone who can relate and understand your experiences.", "Careful, OP might report you to your superiors for not being encouraging /s", "Only checking I've done was to confirm they didn't go to one of the old quack defunct schools. Otherwise, the school they went to is just a curiosity and has no bearing on whether I choose to set up an appointment with a therapist."]}
