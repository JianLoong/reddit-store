I thought we were happy, but it turns out I was happy while she was keeping secrets to herself.  Before me, Lisa was in a relationship with Mary(41f), but it ended. I was told that it just didn\u2019t work out. I didn\u2019t ask any more questions because quite frankly that wasn\u2019t my business and figured she knew her sexuality. \n\nSo, let\u2019s get into it I guess. I live in a house a few blocks away from the college that Lisa is receiving her graduate degree at, and with the way our relationship was going I asked her to move in a little over a year ago. Lisa was put on academic probation due to grades which caught me off guard tbh. I asked what was going on and if I could help. It turns out that would begin our downward spiral. \n\nAfter a few days Lisa came to me and told me she could not fight it anymore, and she needed to tell me that she was gay, and she no longer felt that she had romantic interests in men. I was surprised and to be open, I was livid. I don\u2019t care that someone is gay, but she had no right to steal years of my life from me. Our relationship was a lie, and my time was stolen. I felt like I was going crazy. People were calling her brave while being confused why it would upset me. I gave Lisa an eviction notice (legally) and it went from bad to worse. \n\nLisa does not drive and doesn\u2019t work. She came from NYC and said she had no reason to drive and didn\u2019t want the expense. She didn\u2019t work because of school and free housing provided through me. She contacted her colleges resource center to figure housing out, but they are unable to help and pointed her in direction of shelters and a local church. She can move back home, but she would have to drop out till the fall semester, but due to being on probation that could slow her graduation down to 18 months longer and adding a ton more of debt, and that\u2019s even if the classes she would need would be offered when she reenrolled. Making going home a waste of her graduate time. \n\nI view this as her problem. I\u2019m still bitter about my time being wasted, but a little more has come out. Apparently, the real reason Lisa and Mary split up is due to physical problems, and Lisa is likely to move back in with Mary. Lisa called me last weekend and pleaded to let her stay just till May 21st, but I dismissed her. Most of my friends want to stay out of it, but some say I\u2019m doing something wrong. The one friend who is on my side has asked them why they don\u2019t take her in, and they get uneasy and say why it\u2019s different. \n\nAITA for evicting Lisa?", "created_utc": 1677250522, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ata5h/aita_for_evicting_my_ex/", "score": 181, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Easy for me to say, but don't look at it through a hateful eye.  Let's be honest, you ignored a pretty huge red flag getting into a relationship with someone who had a GF 20 years older than her.  I agree she doesn't owe you a full analysis of her sexuality, but it is absolutely fair to ensure your partner is the same (or compatible) sexual orientation as you.\n\nBut still - NTA as long as you're following the law and giving her some level of grace.  Meaning,   you shouldn't be tossing her stuff in the garbage and being a jerk (doesn't sound like it).  If she needed an extra week or so - fine.

In fact,  the moving out event usually happens immediately with out the need for eviction papers. That fact that she needs evicting instead of just leaving pretty much makes her TAH.", "NTA.

In both cases, the leaving partner deceived the innocent person, even if they were deceiving themselves.  OP has every right to feel used and be angry about the last three years of his life being fraudulent.\n\nBeing queer is hard in our world.  So is being a POC or differently abled or frankly, a woman.  But none of these selves excuse willingly letting an innocent person suffer the blowback of your inner conflicts.

So no, you are not in the wrong imo. No one can expect you to just let your ex live with you after you are not even allowed to grieve.\n\nBut for the sake of everyone involved, maybe have a talk with her about how you hurt for your loss and how you need time to feel your feelings.

The fact that she didn\u2019t plan ahead, blurted out that she couldn\u2019t hide it anymore and now expects him to house her for three more months is too much to ask. He gave her 2 weeks and then went the legal route. She had plenty of time to figure something out. She was already breaking his heart, why on earth should he pay her anymore kindness?", "Hard to respect someone who doesn\u2019t respect you.", "If she could afford rent, why can't she get her own place with roommates then?", "If he wants her around. He doesnt need her to pay for the house and after a breakup it's absolutly reasonable to not be willing to live with an ex that just left him. She is an adult she has to figure it out and she was incredibly lucky to be living there free of any expense.", "She doesn't work. There's literally no source of income for her, and I would defintly prefer to move on with my life. \n\nYou understand that it's very easy to say what you would do until you're in that situation, right?", "OP mentions her mom in the comments", "She literally said she \u201cthought she could change\u201d. Meaning she went into it knowing she was gay. It was, indeed, a sham. And even worse, it seems like she was using him as a meal ticket.", "He received emotional and physical happiness, she received emotional and  financial support. (isn't that a sugar baby?) It feels transactional when it's laid out like that.  \n\nEither way, she's withdrawn the emotional and physical happiness from her side, so....", "Of course, the character count is pretty limiting. It's just that if your reason for the action you took seems insignificant enough to omit, I have to assume it's not actually the reason.", "Literally the first line of my first comment is saying it's fair to evict her since they've broken up. You are arguing with things I have not said.", "That's missing my point entirely, because I am not saying it isn't an expression of grief, but that OP was not using the grieving process to justify his actions. He instead chose to use a stage of grief (anger) and his bitterness and blame to justify and explain his choices. \n\nLots of things are part of grief, and that doesn't magically make them good. Spite is often a part of grief too, but that doesn't make it okay to act out of it. OP's justifications are all anger and bitterness, not healing or closure. I can understand his bitterness and anger are coming from a place of grief without condoning acting on them. \n\nGrieving is not a free pass to be an asshole.", "THANK YOU! Bi-sexuals do exist and can commit to long term relationships and marriages without cheating.", "with whom are you disagreeing?\n\nI think so, as well.   And how long did she \"know\", before she told him.", "Thus situation so reminds me of the girl that was in a relationship with a guy.  Turns out,  he was gay,  and sleeping with her brother until he got through college. \n\nThis feels like the same thing,  the ex is just a user.", "Ah, I never thought about that. You're right. She should probably borrow money from Mary and find a cheap place to live temporarily.", "You're right. She should probably borrow money from Mary and find a cheap place to live temporarily.", "Yes, I understand. Did you read my top-level comment? \n\nHow about asking her to get the money from Mary?\n\nIf you have Mary's contact info, then you can give Mary an ultimatum, either loan your ex the money to pay rent or you'll kick her out.", "She also said \"she **no longer** felt that she had romantic interests in men\" which implies she did have interest in men back when she was dating him. It sounds like rather than being a lesbian, she is bisexual but has a preference for women.", "You, I thought? I thought you were disagreeing with OP in your above comment, it kinda sounded to me like you weren't blaming her for using OP as a test in that comment", "She's 25, and I am not her parent. I accept your judgment but come on?? really? I need to make phone calls for her now?", "Even then it's his house she is not a tennant he has every right to kick her out if he doesnt want her there. He has no obligations to do anything for his ex. It's fine he doesnt want to help her in any way after she dumped him", "He shouldn't have to.  He's not her parent he's her ex-boyfriend.  \n\nShe ended it.  She's not a child who is unable to function.  Why can't she take responsibility for her own arrangements?\n\nShe's a 25 year old grad student.  She should have some life skills by now! It is unrealistic to expect him to continue in the provider roll.", "Regardless it shouldn\u2019t have taken her three whole years to figure that out and she shouldn\u2019t have used another person to do it that long. She was just looking for a free ride while in school. He has every right to do what he did.", "You don't care about extra rent money? Then she should probably borrow money from Mary and find a cheap place elsewhere to live temporarily.", "You're correct that he has the right to kick her out, but letting someone who provided you with 3 years of happiness become homeless when you could easily prevent it is asshole behavior.", "You're right that he doesn't have to help her, but letting someone who provided you with 3 years of happiness become homeless when you could easily prevent it is asshole behavior.\n\nAnd she apparently can't make other arrangements because she has no money.", "So he should enable and infantilize her by allowing her to be dependent on him as a friend and provider?\n\nFrankly, if someone had strung me along for 3 years, lived with me, led me to believe we had a future, allowed me to provide for him, then told me he wasn't actually into me and wanted his ex back, I'd go scorched earth and his stuff would be out on the front yard. You are a much kinder person than I am."]}
