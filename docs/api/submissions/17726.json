We were bffs from 1st grade to college. In college she met a great guy. He proposed to her on graduation and I 100% was giddy. I was her maid of honour. They had a baby a year or so later and 10 months ago I woke up with my fiance to her screaming and knocking at my door at 2am. She claimed her husband kicked her out due to being on her phone while he was trying to sleep? Hes a doctor so I was like, high stress? She left the kid with him, which I thought was odd. I told her to crash on our couch for the weekend. Me and my fiance work but we have a new puppy so we have a camera to check up on her, something I told Sue about. My phone got a notification about human movement and I checked to see her and some strange guy sitting on our couch. Im not being racist, trust me, I dont care. Me and my fiance and my bff and her husband are white. This guy was black. I called her, which I watched her ignore and her and this random guy proceeded to have sex in our living room. I could care less but her and her husband are not in a open relationship. I confronted her about it when I got home. She cried, packed up and left for a hotel. A month later she claimed she was pregnant all over facebook. Her and her husband seemed to reconcile until the baby girl was born. Shes black and looks nothing like their first kid. I saw her husband just shocked outside smoking when I went to visit the hospital. He just said, \"I do not think that baby is mine and she said if I pursue a DNA test, shell divorce me.\" I told him about her and this random guy and I have the screenshots that the camera took to prove it. I showed him and the guy is a friend of a friend. He knew him. He was just gutted. He asked me what to do. I told him to leave her. 100%. We are all in our 30s. Its not acceptable. They are married. They had a kid together. \nHe did.\nMy ex bff called me screaming threats at me saying how she was served with divorce papers and would need to do a custody hearing for the first kid. She said, and I quote, \"XXX needs to be a big man and raise our kids.\"\nI responded, \"He is. Hes raising the kid you two had. Not some other guy.\"\n\"He needs to man up. It doesnt matter.\"\nThat comment blew me away. It matters?!?!\nAm i the asshole for advising him to leave her?\nShes bombarding me with texts and messages on social media, saying how I made her a single mom and how she will need to move in with her parents due to no longer having her husbands salary.\n\n\nEdit: I wish I told her husband. Just I figured that maybe it was a one time thing?
