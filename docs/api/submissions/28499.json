To help out, I've started cooking dinner during the week, as well as taking care of cleaning the house so my dad can relax when he gets home. My dad cooks dinner on the weekends and cleans around the house, as he gets home before I do.\n\nI also work and am usually home by 3:30, so it doesn't bother me to be the one doing a majority of the cooking. My mom works until 5:15 most days, except for Wednesdays, and she also doesn't work weekends, whereas my dad and I do. \n\nI started working longer hours, but I still beat my dad home every day. On Wednesdays, my mom is now the first one home. My dad and I both asked her if she would take care of dinner every Wednesday and make sure the house stays clean, since we were working later in the evening. She said she would, but I could tell she was unhappy about it.\n\nThe first couple of Wednesdays after my dad and I asked her to make dinner and clean, she followed through. By the third Wednesday, however, when I asked her what she was making for dinner, she told me she wasn't making anything. I shrugged and figured we would just order out, and thought nothing of it until my mom added in that she thought it was ridiculous of my dad and I to expect her to provide dinner every Wednesday. She also didn't bother to clean the house.\n\nI told her I didn't agree because I made dinner and cleaned every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, and my dad made dinner and cleaned every weekend. I said I didn't think it was a big deal to expect her to make dinner and clean once a week. My mom snapped and said that she worked hard and should be able to come home to a hot meal and a clean house every single day. \n\nI told her that it was only once a week that she was expected to help out around the house, and that she didn't even have to cook if she didn't want to, and could just order food. She said that she shouldn't have to pay for dinner either, and reiterated that she worked hard and should be able to come home and relax. I started getting annoyed because my mom never helps out around the house and always gets to come home to a hot bath and a hot meal with a glass of wine on a dinner tray.\n\nShe kept arguing that she shouldn't have to clean the house or cook/pay for dinner every Wednesday, and said that my dad and I needed to pick up the slack. I finally snapped at her and told her she was fucking lazy and said I was tired of her never pitching in to help the family out. My mom immediately started crying, said I must not love her enough if I was calling her lazy, and told me I was an ungrateful asshole.\n\nI said I didn't think I was an ungrateful asshole just because I called her on her refusal to help out, and that what I said was true. My mom demanded I apologize but I refused, and now she's pissed because my dad came home and agreed with me. She said I'm an asshole for calling her lazy and turning my dad against her.\n\nAITA here?", "created_utc": 1696771250, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/172yzyf/aita_for_telling_my_mom_shes_lazy/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You each get two days a week where you make dinner for everyone, and maybe one day you order in. Divide the cleaning and laundry and house chores up as evenly as possible and she gets assigned tasks.

Most women I\u2019ve met are usually more open to cooking and cleaning when their husbands are the sole providers. It could be why she\u2019s giving some pushback.

It's not exactly what I meant and I should have worded it better. My dad did agree with me, but what I really meant was that he shared my opinion. Not necessarily an 'oh, he's on my side and not my mom's, that's great' but more so when my mom told him what I said, he essentially told her that he too thought she was lazy and needed to help out more. I definitely should have worded 'my dad came home and agreed with me' a lot better. It came off more obnoxious and entitled than I intended."]}
