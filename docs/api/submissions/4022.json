Normally I'm not one to comment here, especially when Agreeing with the broad consensus, but I wanted to offer a suggestion.\n\nI would seriously consider forming a check-in plan with someone you trust. I don't know if it's something someone at your school would be able to provide, or something you'd have to work out with a friend. Set a date before and after the holidays (the day of your family's flight might be a good one, for example) for them to expect contact from you confirming your okay, and what to do if they don't hear from you. Check with your school and/or local government about resources your contact can reach out to if you miss the check-in (they may refer you to the Department of State, but I'm not sure). The pop culture adage of needing to wait 24 hours to report a missing person is a myth, so the contact having resources on hand from the get-go can only help. Don't inform your family about the check-in plan to avoid cooersion should the worst come to pass. \n\nI don't mean to assume that your family *would* resort to kidnapping, but it's not entirely without precedence.

I hope they didn't just get shipped off but I doubt that.\n\nPlus I couldn't marry anyone I didn't know and wasn't emotionally invested in. Plus the language barrier would suck too.", "Listen to those inner feelings. Trust those instincts. \nGet all the help you can from your university and collect your belongings from home. \nYour passport can be flagged if you contact the US embassy and let them know what you feel is possible kidnapping and/or more.\n\nSorry...edited to add NTA", "Yeah sorry I wanted to write home instead of own. So basically she was kidnapped? Thinking to go for a holiday and never came back?", "Your family has already proven to you that they can't be trusted. \n\nYou are doing what you need to keep yourself safe.\nDon't give in to your parents in this one.\n\nNTA at all", "I wonder if they are just pissed off about the cost of the flights... or the mother of the bride outfit, the caterers, the venue hire...\n\nAll joking aside OP, NTA and good for you for choosing yourself and your liberty and not allowing your love for your family to get in the way of your common sense and your awareness of the risk this visit might pose. Have a wonderful, UNMARRIED, Christmas break. Happy holidays!", "Unless they were willing to cut off and publicly shame those relatives for their actions, then you have no reason at all to trust them. And even if you did, why take the risk? The consequences of not seeing family in person are minuscule in light of video calls whereas the risk is a lifetime of rape and servitude.", "They wasted their own money.", "Your parents wasted their own money by purchasing tickets before you agreed to go. This is just a manipulation tactic. \n\nWe're not your family, but I hope it helps that all of us internet strangers are behind you and support your autonomy. Protect yourself and stay safe.", "I wouldn't trust them either, NTA", "Well they were probably expecting your dowry to cover the cost.", "THEY wasted their money and THEY seem to have given you reason not to trust them.", "They wasted their own money, buying a ticket without Mekong sure you were ok with it.", "Can you verify that they actually bought you a round-trip ticket? (not that I'd trust the trip even if they did, since they could just eat the cost)", "The problem may not be your parents though. They may be subject to pressure themselves in that country. You don't know the family dynamics, it could be an older relative pushes marriage and respect for tradition is invoked, or money, inheritance, land or citizenship.\n\nI'm not suggesting you go, just that your parents may not be the problem.", "They wasted their money by buying you a ticket without any reason to think you'd use it. And they are idiots if they think you'd trust them enough to do the exact same thing that got your cousin kidnapped.", "You trust them to put you at risk and they are proving they do not respect your wishes by buying tickets and choosing to pretend to not understand your decision.", "Who cares, ur parents shouldn\u2019t force you to do something when ur clearly afraid", "they def should have asked you first.", "They wasted their own money.\n\nYou've got to ask why they bought the ticket without asking you first - and I think you already know the answer. They knew you'd say no, so they thought they'd try blackmail instead.\n\nIf a family holiday begins with emotional blackmail, then I think its fair to wonder about what the rest of the trip will be like.", "They shouldn\u2019t be pissed. They bought a ticket without consulting you.  I am sure they won\u2019t agree with that logic.", "Put your important documents in a bank safe deposit box (should be under $50/year for a small one).", "Exactly this.\n\nIf they were ok with it happening to your cousin you can't be sure that it wouldn't happen to you.", "Thank goodness you have a clear head and a spine; no, you're not an asshole for standing up for yourself. \n\nYour parents should be ashamed of enabling your cousins rape and be understanding that you will not be joining them.", "Is your cousin okay???\n\nCan you try to help her?", "Well, that's all I need, too. NTA.", "I think the biggest red flag is as others have said: they are making threats if you don't go (threatening to cut you off.) To me, that means they have a lot riding on it, more than a family visit. If it was just about visiting family, they would be disappointed and sad, they may guilt trip you for them spending money on a ticket. But to take it to another level of \"I'm threatening you into coming with me\": that's more than just a visit. Why take it so far? Too extreme.", "Oh god. That's absolutely terrifying.", "Maybe you should at least let them know your reasoning, that might help them understand and help your relationship with them in future.", "Don't feel guilty. They bought the tickets without discussing it beforehand with you. You never indicated you wanted to go. They could still go on their own.\n\nThe fact that they made this decision without asking you and being so upset by your refusal is a huge red flag.", "you shouldn't.  they knew you didn't want to go and bought the ticket anyway.  that's on them.", "That\u2019s how they wanted you to feel. The only reason to buy those tickets without talking to you first is to A) surprise you (but that only works if you had constantly been talking about how much you wanted to go there) or B) force you to go.\n\nAnd if they\u2019ll try to force you to go to that country, it\u2019s not hard to imagine that they\u2019ll force you to get married while you\u2019re there.", "pretty sure that's the joke", "You aren't. Get a flag on your passport. You can still travel but they'll check you are willing. Your family don't need to know why security and passport control keep stopping you.", "I doubt it.  Trust you gut, OP. NTA and good luck!", "No you are not overreacting in the least. I went to college with someone who had herself declared independent by a court (she was still a minor when this happened) because her father tried to force her into an arranged marriage. I am glad you are legally an adult.\n\nPlease be safe and take care of yourself.  NTA obviously.", "And if you\u2019re overreacting and your parents are not trying to marry you off: so what? You can\u2019t take that chance. It\u2019s better to \u201coverreact\u201d now rather than risk abduction and rape, because that\u2019s what it would be. Stay safe.", "From the comments you\u2019ve made,I don\u2019t believe you are overreacting.  If your parents are OK with what was done to your cousin, and they are threatening you, then they have the same in store for you.  \n\nIt is scary.  I\u2019ve seen young people who are raised in the US act like normal western kids, then suddenly their parents decide they need to \u201cact appropriately \u201c and they get closeted, forced to wear traditional (full covering) clothing, etc.", "You\u2019re absolutely not over reacting. unfortunately people tell women that way too often and makes us doubt guts which can put us at risk. Make sure you have your passport (and all important docs) somewhere safe and your parents don\u2019t know where it is - or even other family members who may help them get it, either intentionally or just not realizing the danger. Also double check your bank accounts that they don\u2019t have access to them to further protect yourself! Good luck and stay safe \u2764\ufe0f", "The risk of them actually wanting to force marry you now might be low, but they have shown to be capable of doing it. I think I would have gone no contact with them as soon as they married your sister away.", "trust your gut.", "No you're not overreacting.  You never know what your parents and relatives are up to lately.  Keep them blocked and move far away from them.", "God know I was thinking how much of a fuss they made despite what happen to your cousin that they are planning the same.  Stay far and secretly away from them. Take the above advise soon than later. If they do drag you into airport yell you have a bomb or anything to get security attention.", "I don't think you are overreacting. If you don't trust your parents enough to know that at least one of them will back you up and don't force marriage on you, don't go. (English is not my first language, this phrase may come out wrong, not blaming anyone here) \nI assume you are in the US i don't know how to help. In Europe there are signe that you can do in airports", "They said it was just a family visit", "Don't really know. Her family is more traditional than mine.", "NTA Op! Make sure you have any legal/important documents in a safe place your parents don\u2019t have access to in case they try to use it as leverage. Birth certificate, passport, social security card these are replaceable but it\u2019s a PITA", "The fact that they're more bent out of shape over money and not the SEX-TRAFFICKING OF THE COUSIN speaks volumes.", "Exactly this", "This is why you never give your passport to anyone else", "Her parents are definitely going to marry her off, and yes this is human trafficking and super illegal. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a dysfunctional family dispute, it\u2019s an international crime in the planning stage. \n\nYes, OP - contact the US State Department if you are in the US. \n\nWhat happened to your cousin? \n\nDo you think you\u2019re safe with your parents? Will they put you on a private plane to get you out of the country? \n\nNTA. You are not overreacting.", "Even if her *parents* aren't, that says very little about aunts, uncles, cousins, etc.  There are some awful news stories about extended families take mg matters into their own hands when the parents of someone with citizenship in a desired country don't go along with their marriage plans.", "I'm sure that's what you're cousin thought too.  You're Parents Hurt feelings don't over-ride your survival instincts.", "Mmhm yeah I agree with others that you made the right decisions.  Best of luck to you in the future, and may you have the strength and wits to deal with whatever they decide to throw at you", "cousin was told the same thing...NOPE.", "You didn\u2019t ask to visit. You are an adult. By trying to make you feel guilty about their choice to purchase a ticket for you without asking you, they are being passive-aggressive. You have better things to do.", "One person's family visit is another person's arranged marriage.", "Tell them your more than happy to FaceTime them once they are their so you can see you extended family but that\u2019s the closest you will ever get to them.", "NTA \n\nkeep a spoon on your person around the date of the travel. \n\nIn the UK it is advised for people as the sooon will set off alarms at the airport security - and you will be separated for extra checks- or so I believe"]}
