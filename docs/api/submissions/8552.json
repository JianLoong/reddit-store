Include him more on the budgeting, so he is more aware of how dire the situation is. Make a long term plan for like 1-2 years and estimate the bank account status and debts.

I manage our entire budget so my husband has no idea. I mean he can access everything but he doesn\u2019t think to because he trusts me with it.\n\nAs is: My takeaway is he was trying to show he loves and appreciates you with the new game you wouldn\u2019t buy yourself.

Although your husband probably didn\u2019t deserve to be blown up at, you were justified in being upset.

Lodging, food, transportation and other essentials have to come before entertainment no matter what his intentions were.\n\nHas he not been poor before?  My mind literally can't comprehend how he could have done this.

Everyone deserves a treat every now and then, regardless of their circumstances, we're all human, but a new gaming system and games, yeah, no. I was thinking more like going out to dinner or splurging for your favorite dessert but a gaming system isn't a treat, it's frivolous.", "NTA. \n\nI think that there\u2019s better ways to have this conversation, but also involve him in the budgeting. \n\nAlso find a way to de-stress.

It sounds like y\u2019all are on different pages. You probably spoke in a way no one liked but in the only reasonable way given the situation.

Either way, I'd say a meltdown was entirely justified. \n\nTime to sit your husband down and go through **everything** in your budget. He needs to be just as aware of the debt, of the struggle to afford necessities, of how painfully tight you are cutting it each week/month. This needs to be as real and pressing an issue for him as it is for you, or you are all heading for a lot of extra strife.", "ESH. If you do all the budgeting how does he not know what the finances are like? Why would you hide this from him?", "NAH. He had a great idea but terrible timing. You mentioned you wanted the game and you know he heard you say that. It represented something different to him than it did to you in that moment.

I would forgive him.", "Controversial buuuut\u2026. YTA\n\nYou were struggling with gas money and were stressed out by it. Ok reasonable. \n\nYour husband goes to get milk and your frustrated he didn\u2019t refill the gas while he was out\u2026 ok but you should\u2019ve talked to him about this. \n\nHe surprises you with a $60 game and you scream, yell, and freak out on him over it since you didn\u2019t even have a PS5\u2026 ok a little over the top but I could see the misunderstanding\n\nYou then run off to the bedroom, see the PS5 he was going to give you on the bed, and instead of going \u201comg I should apologize because obviously he was trying to be nice\u201d YOU DOUBLE DOWN AND SCREAM AT HIM EVEN MORE.\n\nLike wtf at that point that sounds more like anger issues than just fuel related stress", "Husband hasn't learnt to take financial responsibility yet.  This might be the dawn of it, but you'll need to teach him, I guess his parents always paid for stuff growing up, and he hasn't learnt it.\n\nMaybe be sorry for shouting, explain why you were upset, explain that you're grateful that he thought of you wanting the game, but walk him through the finances and budgets and explain that once the basics are covered you'll love to play it with him, but right now your joint priority has to be the basics.", "NTA, but you need to have him sit with you EVERY time you're trying to pay bills and look at the bank account. He doesn't get the dire situation you're in. Might be time, too, for looking at household and childcare responsibilites together - you have a lot on your plate and sound completely overwhelmed. Is there family around who can give you a break from the toddler?", "NAH. Oh, honey, you are running on fumes like your car. It boggles my mind that he couldn't see the gas light on and not stop by a gas station as a gift to you. Go give your husband a big hug because from your post he sounds clueless about the budget and was only trying to lift your spirits. Make a spreadsheet of your budget so he can eyeball for himself the expenses. I truly admire all the juggling you're doing - working, going to school, and raising a family on a shoestring budget. Keep your eye on the prize, you'll get your degree to lift your family up and out of the wilderness, and you will look back on these hard years to find out how fast they went. The very best of luck to you.", "YTA for screaming at your husband and not talking to him about yalls situation. He did something nice for you or thought he was knowing you wanted it. Do you actually budget together? It doesn't sound like it. Why didn't you get gas? Or ask him to while he was out picking up groceries if you wanted him to. Or after. It sounds like yall are in no way communicating and need to sit down and together go over your finances.", "YTA for having a complete meltdown at your partner. There were so many better ways of dealing with this.

(We seem to have just leaned in with our strengths which is good - but at the same time, my job is mentally exhausting and his is physically exhausting soooo this doesn\u2019t always work for us either\u2026).  It\u2019s the way we balance, and there are some switches. For example - I\u2019m the one who organizes WHERE things belong in our home. It\u2019s a physical task but I\u2019m better at that and I\u2019m more concerned about it than he is. At the same time - he does all the grocery shopping. He\u2019s a picky eater who doesn\u2019t make shopping lists and I absolutely cannot stand wandering around in the store, so I refuse to go in the grocery store with him. At the same time - he\u2019s patient enough to find the best deals and will go to multiple places (vs me who is a One Store and Follow the List type of person).  \n\nYou\u2019re sharing here that there isn\u2019t a balance in your house right now - not one that is working for you anyway. You need to work together in this.", "NAH maybe Y T A, depending on how things are divided. Are your finances separate? Does he know how dire the situation is? You didn\u2019t ask for gas so it\u2019s unreasonable to expect him to fill up your tank, or get mad that he doesn\u2019t do it. It sounds like you two have separate finances and he brings in more money so he isn\u2019t struggling while you are, but you aren\u2019t telling him that. \nI have separate finances from my husband and I wouldn\u2019t think twice before dropping 700 dollars on something I wanted. I assume he pays his designated bills, just like he assumes I pay mine. If he doesn\u2019t say he needs money, I assume he doesn\u2019t need money.", "Yeah, good luck with that.  It didn\u2019t matter how much I tried to talk to my spouse about the finances, I couldn\u2019t keep his attention.  He didn\u2019t waste money, but he just didn\u2019t care to hear about it.\n\nI would try, on New Year\u2019s Day, to have a \u2018state of the finance\u2018 talk about how we did the previous year, and the plan for the coming year and didn\u2019t pay attention.  Not rudely, but I could tell he was zoned out.  It was, and is, infuriating.", "He was driving with the gas light on\u2026", "Working full time doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re making enough money to actually live.", "Yeah, the thing that's off is the husbands weaponized incompetence", "There are a lot of nice gestures that aren\u2019t $660", "I think a \u201cnice gesture\u201d for OP would be to take some of the load off her shoulders. He didn\u2019t make a nice gesture, it was selfish. I don\u2019t believe for a minute that this was really for her, when does he truly think she\u2019d have the time?", "Oh, no no no. My ex went and bought a whole game system knowing that we didn\u2019t even have water. I don\u2019t want to say that men are oblivious but some are are. OP is not the AH but there are some people who are", "When it comes to effectively budgeting, you absolutely have to communicate. It is so much easier to be on the same page when you regularly look at your budget together and discuss your priorities together. Couples who do not communicate about their finances are the reason that money/budgeting is one of the leading causes of marital problems.", "I disagree with you entirely. Making assumptions is terrible in relationships. Communication is how the obvious becomes obvious", "> I'm not allowed to hide from the scarier parts of finance, and I gave the tools to get through financially if he gets hit by a bus tomorrow\u013a\n\nThis is the policy my spouse and I have. My spouse is a SAHD but he fully knows the state of our finances. He also make sure that I know basic home repairs and car maintenance so it all won't fall to shit if he suddenly passes.", "Money Dates...dates with you (and your partner) and your money.", "This is not just a \"relationship\" it's a freaking family.", "It\u2019s terrible when the assumption is \u2018they\u2019re cheating because they won\u2019t let me look at their phone\u2019"]}
