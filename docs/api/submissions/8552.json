Include him more on the budgeting, so he is more aware of how dire the situation is. Make a long term plan for like 1-2 years and estimate the bank account status and debts.

I manage our entire budget so my husband has no idea. I mean he can access everything but he doesn\u2019t think to because he trusts me with it.\n\nAs is: My takeaway is he was trying to show he loves and appreciates you with the new game you wouldn\u2019t buy yourself. I suggest talking to him, apologizing for the stressed response and acknowledging he was trying to be thoughtful and kind, then sitting down together to go over your budget and try to make a plan about how to tackle things.\n\nI\u2019m sorry it\u2019s a stressful time!", "NTA.\n\nYour husband clearly had good intentions, but it\u2018s ridiculous and irresponsible to buy such expensive luxuries without communicating it first and especially when you\u2018re highly in debt, can barely afford your necessities AND have a little child to care for.", "NAH. Your husband probably shouldn\u2019t have spent the money and pushed you further in debt, but it sounds like he was trying to make you happy with a sweet gesture that unfortunately just wasn\u2019t appropriate with your circumstances. \n\nYour reaction was a poor one, no reason to blow up, but stress can manifest in ways we aren\u2019t proud of. Although your husband probably didn\u2019t deserve to be blown up at, you were justified in being upset. If there\u2019s a next time, do your best to walk away and cool down so you can discuss rationally why this wasn\u2019t appropriate.", "INFO: A lot of your statements regarding being unable to afford things are \"I\" statements.

Lodging, food, transportation and other essentials have to come before entertainment no matter what his intentions were.\n\nHas he not been poor before?  My mind literally can't comprehend how he could have done this.  I fully (FULLY) understand the need to sometimes treat yourself when you have nothing, but that's a pint of Ben & Jerry's or a nice candy bar, or a bus ride instead of walking, not nearly $700 on something completely frivolous.", "NTA Spending $660 on luxury items without consulting your partner when your credit cards are maxed out and yours cars are running of fumes is irresponsible. Everyone deserves a treat every now and then, regardless of their circumstances, we're all human, but a new gaming system and games, yeah, no. I was thinking more like going out to dinner or splurging for your favorite dessert but a gaming system isn't a treat, it's frivolous.", "NTA. \n\nI think that there\u2019s better ways to have this conversation, but also involve him in the budgeting. \n\nAlso find a way to de-stress.

It sounds like y\u2019all are on different pages. You probably spoke in a way no one liked but in the only reasonable way given the situation.

Either way, I'd say a meltdown was entirely justified. \n\nTime to sit your husband down and go through **everything** in your budget. He needs to be just as aware of the debt, of the struggle to afford necessities, of how painfully tight you are cutting it each week/month. This needs to be as real and pressing an issue for him as it is for you, or you are all heading for a lot of extra strife.", "ESH. If you do all the budgeting how does he not know what the finances are like? Why would you hide this from him?", "NAH. He had a great idea but terrible timing. You mentioned you wanted the game and you know he heard you say that. It represented something different to him than it did to you in that moment.

I would forgive him.", "Controversial buuuut\u2026. YTA\n\nYou were struggling with gas money and were stressed out by it. Ok reasonable. \n\nYour husband goes to get milk and your frustrated he didn\u2019t refill the gas while he was out\u2026 ok but you should\u2019ve talked to him about this. \n\nHe surprises you with a $60 game and you scream, yell, and freak out on him over it since you didn\u2019t even have a PS5\u2026 ok a little over the top but I could see the misunderstanding\n\nYou then run off to the bedroom, see the PS5 he was going to give you on the bed, and instead of going \u201comg I should apologize because obviously he was trying to be nice\u201d YOU DOUBLE DOWN AND SCREAM AT HIM EVEN MORE.\n\nLike wtf at that point that sounds more like anger issues than just fuel related stress", "Husband hasn't learnt to take financial responsibility yet.  This might be the dawn of it, but you'll need to teach him, I guess his parents always paid for stuff growing up, and he hasn't learnt it.\n\nMaybe be sorry for shouting, explain why you were upset, explain that you're grateful that he thought of you wanting the game, but walk him through the finances and budgets and explain that once the basics are covered you'll love to play it with him, but right now your joint priority has to be the basics.", "NTA, but you need to have him sit with you EVERY time you're trying to pay bills and look at the bank account. He doesn't get the dire situation you're in. Might be time, too, for looking at household and childcare responsibilites together - you have a lot on your plate and sound completely overwhelmed. Is there family around who can give you a break from the toddler?", "NAH. Oh, honey, you are running on fumes like your car. It boggles my mind that he couldn't see the gas light on and not stop by a gas station as a gift to you. Go give your husband a big hug because from your post he sounds clueless about the budget and was only trying to lift your spirits. Make a spreadsheet of your budget so he can eyeball for himself the expenses. I truly admire all the juggling you're doing - working, going to school, and raising a family on a shoestring budget. Keep your eye on the prize, you'll get your degree to lift your family up and out of the wilderness, and you will look back on these hard years to find out how fast they went. The very best of luck to you.", "YTA for screaming at your husband and not talking to him about yalls situation. He did something nice for you or thought he was knowing you wanted it. Do you actually budget together? It doesn't sound like it. Why didn't you get gas? Or ask him to while he was out picking up groceries if you wanted him to. Or after. It sounds like yall are in no way communicating and need to sit down and together go over your finances.", "YTA for having a complete meltdown at your partner. There were so many better ways of dealing with this.

He\u2019s a picky eater who doesn\u2019t make shopping lists and I absolutely cannot stand wandering around in the store, so I refuse to go in the grocery store with him. At the same time - he\u2019s patient enough to find the best deals and will go to multiple places (vs me who is a One Store and Follow the List type of person).  \n\nYou\u2019re sharing here that there isn\u2019t a balance in your house right now - not one that is working for you anyway.
