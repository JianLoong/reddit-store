I\u2019ve been driving off the gas light for two days straight. I can\u2019t even afford gas right now and my husband took my car the night prior to go buy some milk, and the next morning that gas light was still on\u2026 I\u2019ve never been the type of expect things without asking, but I haven\u2019t asked him in a while for gas so I don\u2019t know if he realized I needed gas? \u2026but anyways, I came home and saw a brand new game on the kitchen table. The funny thing is I always comment \u201cI can\u2019t wait to be able to afford a new gaming system. I would love to play that game\u201d but I know that in the future I hope we can buy it. So my priorities are focused on making sure the house is good.\n\nI was so upset about a $60 game and I told my husband \u201cWHY WOULD YOU THROW $60 ON A GAME I CANT EVEN PLAY RIGHT NOW? I\u2019m literally driving off the gas light and you bought a video game?!\u201d \n\nI automatically saw the change in energy and he was visibly upset. He said he would return it. I told him that money can go towards groceries please. \n\nAfter hold my tears back from that\u2026\n\nThen I walk into the bedroom and, I just started crying. Fully crying. Like eyes are red, I\u2019m about to pass out, I saw a brand new boxed PS5 system on our bed. \n\nI ran back to the kitchen and said \u201cNOT JUST $60 BUT $600 WHEN YOURE OBLIVIOUS TO THE FINANCES IN THE HOUSE?! WE ARE IN SO MUCH DEBT. WHY?!\u201d And again, husband was just silent and upset with me\u2026\n\nAfter explaining that I was heartbroken that he would go buy a gaming system without telling me than put gas in my car that transports our child everywhere, he said he would return it tomorrow.\n\nWhat upsets me is I\u2019m the person who does the budgeting in the house. The doctors appointments. The making sure things are straight\u2026.so I\u2019m REALLY stressed almost all the time.\n\nAnd I\u2019m also a full time student while working a full time job and a parent to a toddler\u2026\n\nHusband works full time also and takes over when I need to do homework\u2026\n\nAITA for getting upset for my husband trying to surprise me with a brand new PS5 when I can\u2019t even afford gas or groceries right now?", "created_utc": 1674945555, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10nrprq/aita_for_having_a_complete_meltdown_when_husband/", "score": 101, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Are you communicating with him about current expenses and debt? You can't expect him to make good decisions without the info to do so.", "NTA. Include him more on the budgeting, so he is more aware of how dire the situation is. Make a long term plan for like 1-2 years and estimate the bank account status and debts. It really helps to put things into perspective and avoids wasting money now that you need in half a year for a travel, medical examination, study, etc", "INFO: did he actually know what the state of the budget was? I manage our entire budget so my husband has no idea. I mean he can access everything but he doesn\u2019t think to because he trusts me with it.\n\nAs is: My takeaway is he was trying to show he loves and appreciates you with the new game you wouldn\u2019t buy yourself. I suggest talking to him, apologizing for the stressed response and acknowledging he was trying to be thoughtful and kind, then sitting down together to go over your budget and try to make a plan about how to tackle things.\n\nI\u2019m sorry it\u2019s a stressful time!", "NTA.\n\nYour husband clearly had good intentions, but it\u2018s ridiculous and irresponsible to buy such expensive luxuries without communicating it first and especially when you\u2018re highly in debt, can barely afford your necessities AND have a little child to care for.", "NAH. Your husband probably shouldn\u2019t have spent the money and pushed you further in debt, but it sounds like he was trying to make you happy with a sweet gesture that unfortunately just wasn\u2019t appropriate with your circumstances. \n\nYour reaction was a poor one, no reason to blow up, but stress can manifest in ways we aren\u2019t proud of. Although your husband probably didn\u2019t deserve to be blown up at, you were justified in being upset. If there\u2019s a next time, do your best to walk away and cool down so you can discuss rationally why this wasn\u2019t appropriate.", "INFO: A lot of your statements regarding being unable to afford things are \"I\" statements. Are you the only one contributing to shared household expenses (i.e. gas, groceries, etc.)", "NTA.  Lodging, food, transportation and other essentials have to come before entertainment no matter what his intentions were.\n\nHas he not been poor before?  My mind literally can't comprehend how he could have done this.  I fully (FULLY) understand the need to sometimes treat yourself when you have nothing, but that's a pint of Ben & Jerry's or a nice candy bar, or a bus ride instead of walking, not nearly $700 on something completely frivolous.", "NTA Spending $660 on luxury items without consulting your partner when your credit cards are maxed out and yours cars are running of fumes is irresponsible. Everyone deserves a treat every now and then, regardless of their circumstances, we're all human, but a new gaming system and games, yeah, no. I was thinking more like going out to dinner or splurging for your favorite dessert but a gaming system isn't a treat, it's frivolous.", "NTA. \n\nI think that there\u2019s better ways to have this conversation, but also involve him in the budgeting. \n\nAlso find a way to de-stress. You\u2019ve got a lot going on.", "Does he know the severity of the financial situation? \n\nIf you are the one that handles the finances, and he doesn't understand or know how severe the situation is, then you are the AH - for not telling him, and for going off when he was trying to do something sweet for you. \n\nIf he DID know, then your not the AH because his spending that money knowing how broke you are is irresponsible.", "NAH. It sounds like y\u2019all are on different pages. You probably spoke in a way no one liked but in the only reasonable way given the situation. This event makes it clear that y\u2019all need to talk to get on the same page. I recommend both of you managing the finances more transparently and collaboratively.", "NTA - I'd say his heart is in the right place but it's the head that matters.", "NTA Even in a good financial position I cannot imagine spending nearly $700 without talking to my partner, even for a gift for him.", "Sounds like your husband had no idea finances were so tight. Invite him to do the budgeting with you or even take over since you're so busy.\n\nHe's seen how stressed you are and wanted to do something nice for you. Now he realizes how he's made just so much worse. Please be kind to each other. \n\nNAH", "NAH.  He tried to do something sweet. I'm assuming he doesn't fully understand the dire circumstances of your household budget.", "NTA. \n\nAll adults in the household should be aware enough of the financial situation to know when they can and cannot afford to drop $600 on a luxury item.\n\nSo either he didn't actually understand how dire your family finances are, in which case he is an oblivious AH who needs to start paying more attention to the budget, or he knew and purchased it anyway, in which case he is an irresponsible AH who needs to start treating money more seriously. Either way, I'd say a meltdown was entirely justified. \n\nTime to sit your husband down and go through **everything** in your budget. He needs to be just as aware of the debt, of the struggle to afford necessities, of how painfully tight you are cutting it each week/month. This needs to be as real and pressing an issue for him as it is for you, or you are all heading for a lot of extra strife.", "ESH. If you do all the budgeting how does he not know what the finances are like? Why would you hide this from him?", "NAH. He had a great idea but terrible timing. You mentioned you wanted the game and you know he heard you say that. It represented something different to him than it did to you in that moment. He seemed to want to make a little miracle for you and you wanted it as a treat after you got these stressful pieces out of the way.\n\nHe's a little confused but he's got the spirit. I would forgive him.", "Controversial buuuut\u2026. YTA\n\nYou were struggling with gas money and were stressed out by it. Ok reasonable. \n\nYour husband goes to get milk and your frustrated he didn\u2019t refill the gas while he was out\u2026 ok but you should\u2019ve talked to him about this. \n\nHe surprises you with a $60 game and you scream, yell, and freak out on him over it since you didn\u2019t even have a PS5\u2026 ok a little over the top but I could see the misunderstanding\n\nYou then run off to the bedroom, see the PS5 he was going to give you on the bed, and instead of going \u201comg I should apologize because obviously he was trying to be nice\u201d YOU DOUBLE DOWN AND SCREAM AT HIM EVEN MORE.\n\nLike wtf at that point that sounds more like anger issues than just fuel related stress", "Husband hasn't learnt to take financial responsibility yet.  This might be the dawn of it, but you'll need to teach him, I guess his parents always paid for stuff growing up, and he hasn't learnt it.\n\nMaybe be sorry for shouting, explain why you were upset, explain that you're grateful that he thought of you wanting the game, but walk him through the finances and budgets and explain that once the basics are covered you'll love to play it with him, but right now your joint priority has to be the basics.", "NTA, but you need to have him sit with you EVERY time you're trying to pay bills and look at the bank account. He doesn't get the dire situation you're in. Might be time, too, for looking at household and childcare responsibilites together - you have a lot on your plate and sound completely overwhelmed. Is there family around who can give you a break from the toddler?", "NAH. Oh, honey, you are running on fumes like your car. It boggles my mind that he couldn't see the gas light on and not stop by a gas station as a gift to you. Go give your husband a big hug because from your post he sounds clueless about the budget and was only trying to lift your spirits. Make a spreadsheet of your budget so he can eyeball for himself the expenses. I truly admire all the juggling you're doing - working, going to school, and raising a family on a shoestring budget. Keep your eye on the prize, you'll get your degree to lift your family up and out of the wilderness, and you will look back on these hard years to find out how fast they went. The very best of luck to you.", "YTA for screaming at your husband and not talking to him about yalls situation. He did something nice for you or thought he was knowing you wanted it. Do you actually budget together? It doesn't sound like it. Why didn't you get gas? Or ask him to while he was out picking up groceries if you wanted him to. Or after. It sounds like yall are in no way communicating and need to sit down and together go over your finances.", "YTA for having a complete meltdown at your partner. There were so many better ways of dealing with this. Money is always a stressful topic, you need to learn how to have better communication in this space so you can get on the same page - I guarantee this didn't help achieve that end.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think it\u2019s crazy how he is so oblivious to necessities, you need to also let him know that you\u2019re going to take the reins.

He should be doing some of the budgeting and mental load as well (appointments/grocery shopping/ refilling gas/ etc) and be the main caretaker for the child if you're doing school and working full time.\n\nHow is the housework and childcare divided among you two currently? Because from how your post reads, it seems you're doing the majority on top of schooling and work which is insane.", "That's how it sounds.

They haven't been buying extras for years, but he just missed that it was because they didn't have any money???\n\nI could believe that he does not understand the mental stress of being the person who handles it all and keeps them just barely treading water.
