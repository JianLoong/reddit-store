Your feelings are so very valid and reasonable. Do not ever let someone tell you they are not. From a mama who understands what you are going through just know that those moments are not a weakness but a challenge you overcame. I am proud of you for being honest with her as to the reason why you did not attend.

It is unfortunate that through no fault of your own you were not able to have all of those things normally associated with graduation.

This isnt about you, its about him. Part of growing up is learning that sometimes you need to put your own feelings aside to be there for whoever it is about.

How would you feel if the situation were reversed?", "YTA\n\nIt's very immature to let what happened with your senior year affect your ability to celebrate your cousin on what is a big day for them.

You had those things taken from you but guess what you can learn to be happy for someone who got to experience it", "NAH but I think you should talk to someone about this- the mental/emotional aftermath of the pandemic is still very much alive. If you can't find or afford therapy, there are some good free apps that help (my daughter graduated in 2020 and now has severe anxiety- she's been using the free version of Calm).  And, a word of advice from a internet stranger- when asked why you are not going, etc.- just say you are super busy, have a project due, or something true that would take up your time.  Even in the best of families, being completely honest (out of context or not) brings out the flying monkies.", "NTA.  It was almost NAH - but your aunt shouldn't have gone running her mouth.  She asked a question (that she shouldn't have asked - you RSVP'd no.  Its the end of the conversation), and then went running around trying to paint you in a bad light.   \n\n\nAnd I'm sorry - but who invites extended family (cousins) to the graduation ceremony itself?  The party is one thing, but honestly what the hell?  I've never not seen a limit to the # of people who could attend - everyone got so many tickets, so that one kids extended family didn't take up all the seats. Honestly - I would've called them the asshole for inviting you to the graduation ceremony itself", "NTA. Especially since you haven\u2019t hidden the reason, let them get on with it", "NTA - Any-Engineering said it best.  If you went the aunt would lean on you for being down.  You did the right thing and avoided the event.", "She owned her decision too even if it didn't paint her in a flattering light. This should always be supported. Radical acceptance of negative emotions and making rational decisions as a result of said emotions should be applauded. OP is walking into adulthood with a steel spine.", "Reddit has a huge number of Branch Covidians who bought into the propaganda 100% and see anyone who takes issue with anything done to us in the name of covid as being a living incarnation of evil.  I have long suspected that a whole lot of the users here fall into that camp just based on other things I see of them and what I know of the kinds of people who went all-in on the covid hysteria.", "Easy for us to say when *we* got all those things. NAH", "> NAH but you do need to learn to get over it.\n\nSo let me get this straight, you Branch Covidians get to tell the people that YOU hurt to \"just get over it\" but when we were telling you the same shit back after the shots got out to the public and we wanted all the restrictions lifted immediately well we were just out of line?  Yeah, that's bullshit and you know it.", "I am taking my cousin out to lunch when our schedules line up", "When his family fid nothing I see op point. There were things the could have done to acknowledge his accomplishments. Cards FaceTime small gifts but no one bothered. It would have been nice to have someone care. I get his point. So you are saying his accomplishment did not matter but others do?", "So to ignore his accomplishment is ok?  He should not expect anyone to care about him. As I said they could have done many things to celebrate but no one cared. FaceTime send cards small gifts at least acknowledge his accomplishment but none of his family did. He is NTA", "Never said I wasn't happy, just jealous", "I never said I wasn't happy for him, just jealous, and I did not want to bring any bad feelings into these events so I'm not going", "Shut this Branch Covidian revisionism the fuck up.  No, being forced to miss milestones due to unjustified mass hysteria isn't OK just because that mass hysteria is going to be in the history books.", "Choosing to not attend is mitigating the emotions. They were happier not going. \n\nThe good thing about being an adult is that you don\u2019t have to do something that makes you unhappy just to please other people.", "Ahhhh.  You're just crazy.  Cool.", "Based on that, it's been 2 years and you're in a new stage in life.  It's time to move on.   Part of life is getting used to the fact that others will get things you don't.  \n\nYou're not an AH but you need to learn to let it go.  You're only hurting yourself.", "You don't have to \"just get over it\". It's a right of passage that people have gotten to experience for decades. My advice, do what we did: organize your own graduation party with some friends and maybe even invite others who also didn't get the experience. Make your own experience", "What does Branch Covidians even mean?  \n\nYeah it's something you have to suck up if you're an adult.  OP is 20.  Time to pull the big kid pants up.  \n\nSorry that you viewed a ceremony that half the people skip anyways more than people's lives.  I'll let my neighbor know her husband's death totally wasn't a big deal and more people should have died so you could go cough in more faces.", "Perfect!", "OP didn\u2019t say that. Only that not much was done by the school. All of that could\u2019ve happened at the picnic", "No, Im saying that life happens and you either get over it or are a bitter person about it. OP can\u2019t control that they didn\u2019t get the graduation fanfare, not participating in others and loved ones is pathetic and selfish.", "The OP didnt mention what the family did or didnt do, just what the school did and public events held. The cousin in question would have been 15ish at the time too, aside from wishing them congrats, what would you expect them to do?", "I'm confused are you talking about OP? Or the cousin?", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Agreed but that first line lmaoo", "I agree with this. OP, NTA at all, I think your feelings are valid and you\u2019re not obligated to attend this stuff, especially with it not being an immediate family member. But, bear in mind, you\u2019re going to get to do this with college in a couple years (or however long). Quite frankly, graduation ceremonies aren\u2019t that exciting - you walk up to get your diploma and then sit back down for what feels like (and sometimes literally is) hours to listen to the phone book be read. This always follows the worst speech you\u2019ve ever heard in your life. These ceremonial things aren\u2019t as important as what they actually signify, which is that you\u2019ve progressed to the next stage of your life. Just for yourself, I would work on managing your feelings of disappointment and I think it may help to realize that these things never seem as important in retrospect.", "So why didn\u2019t family go to park to help celebrate?", "Family did not care so why should he. He has a right to his feelings and he did what he felt best. So just get over his feelings and worry about everybody else\u2019s? He\u2019s not being selfish he was hurt the way the family and everybody did not even acknowledge his accomplishment. He has that right. Life throws crap at us all the time are we supposed to just ignore it and be happy?", "See above", "Op family", "Its more of a 50/50, but either way", "I don't talk to my father and my mother could careless about what I do with my fathers side", "tell me if i am missing something but i don't think thats what this is about. It's weather OP IS wrong for not going to the party and being jealous not about OP's family sending a card or something like that", "Don't go, but between the two options citing jealousy is not a good call.", "That is part of it seems nobody cared about his accomplishment. That\u2019s all part of his jealousy. It might\u2019ve been different if people made an effort for his accomplishment. I get how he\u2019s feeling but there would\u2019ve been ways for family to celebrate him also. I think that\u2019s where the jealousy is coming from. He will get over it but it\u2019s still a sore point right now"]}
