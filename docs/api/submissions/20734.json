You can simultaneously feel happiness for someone and their accomplishments while suffering your own hurts and not wanting be a burden or, as you said, bring the mood down. If you had gone to the party your aunt would have prob still accused you of being selfish for moping around and assume you were trying to make it all about what you missed out on. It\u2019s a no-win situation, but you did the right thing.", "NTA because you did not say it to your cousin in a rude way  or cause a scene at the graduation or anything, you bowed out respectfully and took your space because you knew you wouldn\u2019t be in a good mood being there. I doubt anyone would\u2019ve wanted you there is you were just pouting the whole time anyways tbh. \n\nYour aunt is kinda TA for telling people what was said in a private conversation when you were trying to be honest with her. Also cousins in my family were never expected to go to graduations because we all have our own very busy lives? Your family seems shitty to not be understanding of that. \n\nTell the people texting you that they have no need to butt into a conversation they were not involved in you did what was going to be best and if they don\u2019t stop then what also might need to happen is them being muted or blocked for being rude. \n\nTry to work on the jealousy because you will miss out on a lot of things over it.", "You are the farthest thing from spoiled! You\u2019re not saying \u201cI want more than everyone else\u201d (the usual definition of spoiled), but that you are sad you couldn\u2019t have what most HS grads have gotten for the last 100 years! Your aunt is a jerk for spreading around what you told her. You know that it\u2019s not your cousin\u2019s fault and you were purposely trying to NOT dump your sadness on his big day. I think that was nice of you and I\u2019m sorry your family can\u2019t see that.\n\nNTA", "NAH. I graduated college in 2020 so I understand. It feels weird to miss all these milestones that people talk so much about and make a big deal of. The events aren't frankly as big and amazing as people make them out to be, but especially in high school they kinda feel like rites of passage. That being said, it's not your cousins fault in the least. He just has the fortune to be a couple years behind you and the world has mostly righted itself during that time (covid-wise). Acknowledging that feeling of jealousy is a very important step, now you just have to figure out what to do with it and how to let it go.", "NTA you lost out on so much because of the pandemic. Your aunt can get bent, she has no idea what it\u2019s like to miss out on so much. \n\nMy oldest was class of 2020, my middle was class of 2021. I get it, that shit was hard. It is okay to tell people how you are feeling and why you are feeling that way. Iy is not okay for someone to shame you for your feelings. I am so sorry that you missed out on so much. Your feelings are so very valid and reasonable. Do not ever let someone tell you they are not. From a mama who understands what you are going through just know that those moments are not a weakness but a challenge you overcame. I am proud of you for being honest with her as to the reason why you did not attend. She should be ashamed of herself and I hope she finds the empathy that she is seriously lacking. \n\nI would also encourage you to find someone (professional or not) you can work through those feelings with as it has been extremely helpful for my kids.", "I'm gonna say NTA\n\nI think you are self-aware enough to realize that this may be triggering to you. If I were your cousin I'd rather you be happy and not attend then unhappy and attend.\n\nMaybe ignore the rest of your family and ask what your cousin thinks. I think if they said they wanted you there then maybe you should go but I don't think you TA for not wanting to go.", "NAH \u2014 you said yourself that you are happy for him, but that you think your jealousy would bring the mood down, which isn't a bad reason not to go. But he's also allowed to be hurt that you're not there to attend and support him. It's a really tough situation, because you lost something that you'll never get back, but if you continue to not attend graduations, they'll be losing something they can't get back either: your support during important events in their life. \n\nYou're not TA for needing to mourn what you didn't have, but you will be if you don't focus on working through these feelings so that you can be there for your close family and friends.", "NTA\n\nYou would be the AH if you showed up and brought the mood down. You instead chose to keep your feelings private and removed yourself from the situation for the benefit of yourself and your cousin. You Aunt pried and you were honest. You decisions and emotions show that you\u2019re struggling but doing your best.", "YTA\n\nYes the pandemic sucked.  As a result you can feel cheated, but it was not personal (despite over 1 million US deaths and nearly 7 million world wide not counting residual illnesses amongst the nearly 1 billion cases of COVID world wide  https://covid19.who.int/?mapFilter=deaths)  So why not celebrate what you acknowledge you are happy about for your cousin.  Don't be so transactional that a world event that effected everyone now makes it impossible to return to LIFE.  Will you never go to a graduation again in your life?  If you have kids will you let them know you can't be there?  If you feel the world revolves around you, this may be a problem, but it shouldn't; go have a nice time with friends and family.", "Going to tell you now, they really aren't that big of a thing.   You've built them up to be stuff they aren't.  \n\nAre you going to college or working?  \n\nNAH but you do need to learn to get over it.", "NTA you feel how you feel.\n\nNext time though learn how to say \u201cSorry I must have gotten a stomach bug.\u201d  Case closed end of story.", "YTA - and also petulant, childish, and stubborn. Grow up.", "NTA - Admitting why you didn\u2019t want to go is a terrific first step. You were able to identify your thinking rather of inventing a justification. \n\nNow work on yourself to overcome your jealousy.", "YTA. I graduated in 2020. From someone who knows, your aunt is right. A real graduation is a luxury, not a need. While it\u2019s valid to wish you had these cultural milestones, it should not be holding you back from celebrating your family. You\u2019ll get a college graduation.", "YTA. It is unfortunate that through no fault of your own you were not able to have all of those things normally associated with graduation. It is valid to be upset about it and even to feel jealous of your cousin who does get to. But what makes you the asshole is that just like its not your fault you couldnt, its not your cousins fault he does get to. You are focusing on your own feelings at the expense of your cousin. This isnt about you, its about him. Part of growing up is learning that sometimes you need to put your own feelings aside to be there for whoever it is about. It doesnt mean your feelings arent valid or dont matter, but then is not the time for them. How would you feel if the situation were reversed?", "YTA\n\nIt's very immature to let what happened with your senior year affect your ability to celebrate your cousin on what is a big day for them. If you get divorced in the future, are you going to skip every wedding you're invited to? I'm sure it sucks on the inside, but you have to push through pain sometimes in order to be there for others.", "YTA. Highschool is very literally one of the least important things in your life and if you\u2019re this hung up about it you need therapy", "YTA be happy for him and stop acting like a kid", "I mean it\u2019s true, your cousin getting a graduation has absolutely nothing to do with you not getting one. It isn\u2019t his fault, and kind of dickish to not just suck it up and deal with it. This is something that he will remember, and if you guys have any sort of close relationship, it will probably be on the mend for awhile. I lost the last 3 years of my college experience to COVID, including a botched graduation at the end of the pandemic, and you don\u2019t see me(or most people for that matter) scrooging out on every college student that lives in my town and gets to party, go to sporting events, have fun, and do all the things I wasn\u2019t able to from 2020-the end of 2022. In my opinion, YTA. Suck it up.", "YTA \n\nYou know that you are because it's not your cousin's fault that the pandemic happened the year you graduated rather than the year he did.\n\nHowever, your aunt is also an asshole for spreading this around. Especially to your cousin! That really wasn't necessary.", "YTA - it was his day and you made it about you. I'm really sorry things didn't go the way you wanted them to for your grad and prom - the pandemic sucked and took away lots of things that we loved. But that doesn't give us the right to cast a shadow over other people's good things.", "[removed]", "Info: are you close to him and/or his family? If so, YWBTA if you don\u2019t go to the party. Life is full of undeserved and unexpected disappointment. You can choose to wallow in them or move past them and find other joy. It\u2019s been two years since you graduated. Does it suck that you lost that full experience? Sure. Should you hold onto that to the point of avoiding other events? Nope.", "Info: why are you mad at your cousin when it wasn\u2019t his fault you were robbed of those experiences?", "i think i\u2019m going with ESH. your feelings are totally understandable and valid, but not going to the graduation AND the party? you can\u2019t fake a smile for even one of them? especially grad parties\u2014you don\u2019t have to stay long at those if you don\u2019t want to. show up for 20 minutes, congratulate him, talk to him and family for a little bit, then leave when it\u2019s getting too much. covid SUCKED especially for those of us who lost out on important milestones, but what are you going to do? just avoid graduation related events for the rest of your life? that\u2019s not how it works. aunt also sucks for spreading around what you said. it\u2019s great that you were honest about why you said no; it means you recognize what\u2019s going on with your feelings. that doesn\u2019t mean you were willing or ready to tell anybody else how you were feeling, least of all your cousin. just a lot of immaturity on both sides here imo", "YTA and need to get over not having a grad or prom. I didn't have those either but my brother did and I'm going to his graduation tonight and am happy for him. He got to do the things I didn't get to, including being able to go to school for his last 2 years of high school, which I would've loved.
