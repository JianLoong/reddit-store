You have no clue about the legality.", "OP is paying half the mortgage on the house, where do you get \"free of charge\" out of that?", "OP asked the tenant permission and got that permission. Tenant was free to say no.\n\nOP is doing ex a huge favor not forcing a buy out. OP needs to stop doing that immediately given ex is being difficult.", "That would be something but OP doesn't even seem to be charging enough rent to cover their full 1/2 of the mortgage payment.\n\"I'm paying about 1/3 of my 1/2 of the mortgage still myself, not living there.\"\nAlso it sounds like they would be open to reducing that person's rent for the duration of their stay as this person likely pays utilities so they're offsetting the cost of OPs stay to them.", "They\u2019re not your buddy, guy.", "They're not your buddy, pal", "They\u2019re not your buddy, guy.", "It is relevant since everyone says NTA on the base that it\u2019s his right as the owner", "They're not your guy pal", "I still have conversations with his parents.", "They're not your pal, guy", "\"Pal\"? I haven't heard that term since I was in Niagara Falls.", "I didn\u2019t say it\u2019s relevant or not I said that you have no clue about the legality because there isn\u2019t enough information available to make that assessment.", "That's kind of a ridiculous thing to expect though. You were with this person for 10 years, and you've broken up. Emotions are obviously going to be raw... you truly thought you'd come live with him in the same house occasionally, and that everyone would be fine with it?? You are N T A bc it's your home too, but any plan short of selling (or him buying you out) was/is completely unrealistic.\n\nHopefully this situation has shown you and your ex that sharing a mortgage post breakup is unsustainable, and you guys can start working on fully separating.", "Who is paying for the basic maintenance of the house? If there's an issue with the roof or the hvac, whose pocket does that come out of? Is your ex being paid for maintaining the yard? It seems like you want your ex to put in all the work of homeownership while you reap the rewards.", "Eh. You bought a house with your decade long partner. That implies a certain amount of staying out and a certain lifestyle. Then a year later you decided you needed to be free to travel, so you left the relationship and the house. I would absolutely call that bailing. I also think it's really interesting that you say the relationship \"just fizzled\" and it was amicable- I find it hard to believe that your ex is as nonchalant about all of this as you are, and I find it shocking that you don't understand why what you're asking is ridiculous of an ex. \n\nIf you want investment property, buy your own. Get your name off the deed and loan for the old house and let ex move on.", "I accidentally commented on the wrong comment thread my bad.", "They\u2019re not your pal, omelet", "Yes I have no clue just like everyone else under this post, I was responding to someone saying that it\u2019s his right as a owner.\nMy point was we don\u2019t know.", "It\u2019s his house. It\u2019s not at all ridiculous to expect he could live there temporarily. He literally pays his part of the mortgage.", "House repairs are still split between us 50/50", "They\u2019re not your omelet, goose."]}
