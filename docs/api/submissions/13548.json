That's because you own half, and the house is lived in by 2 people.  \n\nYour ex agreed to the roommate under the belief that they'd be the only one there.  There's a difference between living with 2 people vs 1 person.  \n\n> For the short-term, we would work out whatever is monetarily fair for the tenant's rent during my time there. \n\nYou would also need to factor in that you're taking usable space from your ex.

So basically the tenant should have reduced rent to be a third of the bills, you pay out of pocket for a third, and your ex pays a third.
