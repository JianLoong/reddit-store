He\u2019s a jerk for saying you can\u2019t when you can, and probably has a serious relationship going in that he\u2019s not divulging the full details about. But why would you you want to be around a person that you broke up with and moved away from? In the same space no less? \n\nIf he\u2019s involved in a serious relationship he needs to express that because he shouldn\u2019t have to explain to a new SO why his ex is staying at his \u2018place\u2019 for a while. But you need to acknowledge that saving money isn\u2019t a realistic reason to basically move back in with your ex.", "NTA. But why would you want to have all this extra drama in your life? Cut your ties with the ex and move on.", "YTA - you can\u2019t peacefully live with an ex, I just don\u2019t think it can be done. Maybe work out a deal with your mortgage for that period & sell the house asap", "mainly NTA but un-F this financial tie. Of course it's a red flag but not for the reason he thinks. It's a red flag because you and he are still as intertwined financially as though you were still together.   \n\n\nIt's like you guys haven't really broken up. It's probably not a good idea to go back but you are within your rights to do so.", "Kinda sorta, if you want to move back in, the rent being paid exclusively to you for your half of the house would need to be split equally. Currently you and the partner pay 50% each. Basically you each own a bedroom and a half. Right now you're renting out a bedroom and paying for the half a bedroom you own. You're not entitled to the third bedroom and the profit from the rental. if you're willing to pay up it's not a big deal but your partner is right in not letting you take over the majority of the house while paying half.", "Technically you're NTA, but idk why you'd want to stay in a house where your ex lives, even if it's just for a couple days.", "On the one hand, I totally get where your ex  is coming from.\n\nIt would be wierd, he wouldn't knowingly let you move back in if he had his own place, except this is a place you both own. So NTA technically but this isn't sustainable \n\nThe thing is your paying for a house that is of no benefit till you until its sold. So really it's time to sell it or be bought guht out", "She owns 50% and is already using 1/3 bedrooms for a tenant. All his rent goes to her. \n\n\nOP should at least be splitting the tenant's rent 50/50 with her ex, then.", "Punctuation is your friend, friend.", "Yes but his half is rented to someone else so legally he is not entitled to stay there", ">INFO: Has your ex ever considered you to be an abusive person?\n\nI don't believe so.

Meaning ex pays utilities and the like, from my understanding\n\nAt this point, ex needs to buy you off and be done with it. Asking to move back in is ridiculous and their ex is right", ">There's no reason to keep paying for a house you don't use.\n\nThe reason I'm still still paying for this house is to be able to use it at times, and to think of it as an investment that appreciates over time.", "No one is demanding anything here. I am friends with the tenant and we speak quite frequently. The first thing I did was ask him if he was okay with it.", "I think both parties are male here.", ">OP should at least be splitting the tenant's rent 50/50 with her ex, then.\n\nOP's ex is living in the house, OP is not. Since the ex is getting the value of living there and OP does not, it seems fair that OP get the rent money for his half of the mortgage.", "Ok I don\u2019t understand at all now haha. All the rent goes to her?", "That makes absolutely no sense, since the ex lives in the house and, as such, gains a benefit from that. The OP is effectively subletting their half of the house. And they would be justified in not only charging the renter the entire half of their mortgage, but putting a bit of profit on top of it, and keeping it all themselves. This is how subletting works.", "2/3rds of his half. Op is still paying towards the house. With this math, op should be entitled to live at their house for at least 4 months of the year", "legally he is still a co-owner of the house so yes he is", "In that case, NTA, but you shouldn\u2019t be paying any of the mortgage if there is no benefit to you.", "It sounds like you wanted to travel and be free and your partner of a decade wanted to be settled down in the house you bought together, so you bailed and moved a roommate in to cover the mortgage, and now you want to move back in \"temporarily\".

Or did you just \"think\" it'd be available to you?\n\n\nAlso, you say you get the tenant's entire rent? So, your ex is in one bedroom, the tenant is in one bedroom, and you'll be in one bedroom? You'll benefit from 2/3 bedrooms? At minimum, half the tenant's rent should be going to your ex while you are there.\n\n\nAnd, while your tenant is saying okay, they might not actually be happy, either, if they made an agreement based on living with one person, not two.", "It sure sounds like you are demanding or at least not taking no for an answer.  There are two people living there and the other person told you no in no uncertain terms.", "Ya but if they want to move back in they have to pay.", "As a owner he has to pay towards the house. How much is rented would depend on the terms of the contract with his tenant and not on how much he pays. But the tenant seems to agree so maybe.", "Depends where I am from if you rent your half you actually don\u2019t have the right to use the place anymore.\nBut idk might not be the case there", "Well, the benefit was I thought I'd be able to live there temporarily and to think of the house as an investment that would appreciate over time.", "Essentially that's the situation. However I find it interesting you say \"you wanted to travel and be free\" then \"you bailed\", which I don't think are equal statements.", "Not necessarily depending on the lease agreement between all three parties.", "Depends on the situation. If he is renting out his ownership of the house then he really doesn't have the right to be their.\n\nIf it was a 4 bedroom house and the OP was renting out their 2 bedrooms to the tenet then the OP wouldn't have the right to take the spare bedroom that the ex owns in this case. In this case the OP would have to get the tenet out to then move back in.\n\nIt all comes down to how the ownership is split and what agreements are in place. It's not a strictly \"OP can do whatever they want\" situation.", "On the same logic her ex the 2/3 of bedrooms the other 50 weeks of the year which seems fair.\n\nShe said she pays 1/2 the mortgage and the tenants rent covers most of that.  She still pays more total than she collects.", "We never discussed this (obviously a dumb move) and I assumed I would have access to a house I own.
