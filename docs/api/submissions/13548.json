That's because you own half, and the house is lived in by 2 people.  \n\nYour ex agreed to the roommate under the belief that they'd be the only one there.  There's a difference between living with 2 people vs 1 person.  \n\n> For the short-term, we would work out whatever is monetarily fair for the tenant's rent during my time there. \n\nYou would also need to factor in that you're taking usable space from your ex.

So basically the tenant should have reduced rent to be a third of the bills, you pay out of pocket for a third, and your ex pays a third.

You're now in a weird kind of co-owner/landlord arrangement, and landlords don't get to stay in their tenants' apartments just because they own the place\u2014even if they used to live there. \n\nLegally, you may be able to insist on your right to stay there, but that doesn't make it a good idea.", ">If OP moves back in then the rent paid up till now needs to be split with the ex.\n\nNo, ex is getting a much better deal and screwing over OP as is. If ex couldn't buy OP out, and a sale wasn't feasible for whatever reason, then both should've moved out and the entire house should've been rented out, which would probably cover the mortgage and all the expenses until they could get it sold.\n\nEx is already screwing over OP with this bullshit. I don't see how OP staying there for a few days entitles ex to not only current rent, but a share of all rent up until this point (which isn't even enough to cover OP's portion of the mortgage).", "No, I'm saying if OP moves back in then the rent that OP is currently receiving needs to be split between both owners. Currently, OP is basically renting out their half of the house.", "Op owns half of the house that has 3 bedrooms. They pay half the mortgage which entitles them to 1.5 bedrooms and half the use of the common areas. Currently they rent that space out to a tenant. It doesn't matter that they aren't getting the full mortgage price out of the tenant. If OP wants to move back in they're now occupying the space the tenant was paying for so that rent money from the tenant should be split evenly during OPs stay back at the house. If OP moves back out then the arrangement goes back to tenant paying OP but while OP and Tennant are living there they're using more than the space OP is entitled to.", "The other comment might be referring to a more traditional landlord/tenant situation. Like I rent my house, but the owner isnt entitled to live at my house just because he owns it without it being in a contract", "So does OP's ex own half of the last bedroom? If so, why can't the ex deny OP from occupying the ex's half of the bedroom? \n\nAssuming OP and OP's EX each pay half of the mortgage and OP gets all of the tenant's rent money, then OP's EX would only be getting 1/3 of the house while paying 1/2 of the rent.", "When op sublet a room they crossed into dangerous waters.\n\nUnless the room is sublet by both then op owe ex 50% of rent.\n\nSo it comes down to op owning ex money or tenant is illegally in home.\n\nRoll the dice", "I'd be interested in how long OP hung around after making the decision to travel.  Did he stick around long enough to actually go through the whole division of assets?  Was he available in order to sell the house?  Or did he just bugger off without a glance backwards and not bother doing all that paperwork stuff?  If it was the former then both OP and ex are TAs for not sorting it out, but if he just skeddadled then he's TA for not sorting out his responsibilities.", "Yes they should have forced a sale. In summer of 2022\n\nBut op didn't do that.\n\nOp went to live as a digital nomad and rented his portion of the home for a price he and tenant agreed to.\n\nThat it doesn't cover his portion of the mortgage isn't EX issue.\n\nOp wanting to move back in for a few months July to mid September isn't a few days.\n\nRegardless he either needs to decide that he was always a resident of the home hence 50% of rent due to EX or he is returning cause he owns 2/3 of the bedrooms\n\nThis is a screwed up situation but op best watch how he approaches it cause I am going to run with the assumption he was going about this under the table and hasn't filed correct taxes/permits as a land lord.", "Oh okay, yeah, that's fair. That could also give his ex an incentive in the extra money.", "They're not \"moving back in\" though, it sounds like a temporary situation.", "Except it doesn't matter because OP stated the ex said it is not about the money.", "Literally not the situation they\u2019re in. But ok", "He's a landlord at this point that co-owns a property. It is not his residential address any longer and it's ridiculous for him to treat it as such.", "It might be his house but it's his ex's home.\n\nWould you be happy with an ex moving into your spare room for a few months?", "I\u2019d be interested to know how long he knew he wanted to travel. Given the timeline, I\u2019d put big money on him having doubts about the relationship at the time the house was purchased. How do you make a huge life/financial decision with someone and then end the relationship \u201camicably\u201d because it \u201cfizzled\u201d within months?", "RIP my karma but I guess I just didn't lay it out well enough. And ya if the ex is still resistant at that point then the ex is an asshole.", "Ok then temporarily the rent money should be split. Currently both OP and expartner(EP) each pay half the mortgage. OP is renting out his portion of the house for money. If OP moves in then Op is using a third of the space, EP is using a third of the space and then OP is profiting off the last third of the space. If OP wants to move in temporarily then during that period the money the tenant pays should be split between OP and the EP so they are both paying reduced mortgages because of the tenant. When OP moves back out then they can return to the current arrangement which is totally fair.", "Talk to me Goose....", "How so?\n\nSublet is the easiest thing people on here could understand.", "I've had an ex that was still on the lease for what was our apartment and needed a place to stay for a month about 6 months after he moved out. He stayed in what had become my gaming room and we led our separate lives for a month sharing a roof. It wasn't ideal but life happens and sometimes we have to accommodate situations that aren't what we expected.", "\\> Would you be happy with an ex moving into your spare room for a few months?\n\nWould you be happy not being able to stay in a house you pay a mortgage on?\n\nPlaying reductionist games makes no sense. The context literally determines the situation. Your body temperature is higher than your IQ.", "Yeah I thought you meant OP was suggesting he doesn't pay at all and I was like, wait, that's not what he did.", "OP said that they were willing to work that out in the original post.", "COBRA CHICKEN!\n\nNow, go ahead and lets that one marinates.", "Go on back to the pond since you want to be such a silly goose XD", "Because it's not the situation.\n\n- The tenant is not subleasing. They're *leasing*. Stop calling it subleasing. There is no lease to sublet. It does not work like subletting.\n- All owners would have to agree to the lease to set up the lease agreement. That means the situation isn't \"OP leased to tenant\" it's \"OP and ex leased to tenant\". OP recognizes this fact, which is why he says, \"We got a tenant.\"\n- *The tenant agreed to OP staying there.* The tenant has *nothing* to do with this post *at all*. The tenant is wholly irrelevant to OP's current issue. Not even a little bit.\n\nThe fact that the division of the mortgage payment is 50% ex, 33% OP, and 17% tenant *does not change anybody's rights*. That division is entirely the agreement between OP and his ex. That division is *not* tied to the lease agreement with the tenant. That's because *it's not fucking subleasing.*", "Dear dear, who stole the milk from your cornflakes this morning?  \n\nThat literally *is* the point.  Ex does not want OP in his home.  Ex has said this.  OP has reported this.  What else do you need? \n\nAlso, as a landlord, I do pay a mortgage on a house I am not able to stay in.", "Ya in that case just move back in and let the ex figure it out. It's their right to be in their home.", "I thought hunting them was illegal?! If not; I know what that 4 iron that came with me golf set is for\u2026. It\u2019s my sword while trying to get back my golf balls the Cobra Chickens have claimed."]}
