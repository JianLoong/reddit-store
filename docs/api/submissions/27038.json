You\u2019re not very good at telling stories. How many children do your son and DiL have? Why are there two in the house when she\u2019s having quiet time? Or did your son drop them off and they snuck past you to go straight to bed? Why was your DiL needing quiet time? What is going on in that family - arguments or is she stressed from work or what? What did your son lie to you about and why is it pertinent to this story? Why hasn\u2019t your DiL and two grandchildren at your sons house ever met the grandchild you are taking care of? Do you not have a smart phone or was it out of battery? How did he call you at his house?\n\n2. Your son and his family should have treated you better in this emergency situation. They seem selfish and self-absorbed, but it\u2019s obvious that there\u2019s more to the story that you\u2019re not telling and possibly not even aware of.\n\n3. You remained at his house when you clearly weren\u2019t wanted there. That\u2019s really bad manners. It\u2019s fine to go over when you\u2019ve been told you have an open invitation but once you saw the actual situation was different you should have adapted and left, not hung out in the dark like ghosts til you got kicked out.", "There has got to be something missing. \n\nThere is a storm bad enough to kill power, but your DIL sends her husband and kids out in it?\nKnowing a storm is coming you don\u2019t have everything charged?  You don\u2019t have backup battery supply in a storm area?  Why couldn\u2019t you charge your phone in the car?", "So if you couldn't call and thought you'd be without power for a few days, it's reasonable to show up. \n\nHowever YTA because \n- she told you it was her alone time (ie NOT a good time to hang out) and had sent her children/son out into the storm, so clearly she really really needed to be alone \n- you are so inconsiderate that you still expected her to socialise\n- you seemed to be incapable of following the rules in her house, like letting her children sleep \n- your expectation wasn't just for essentials like power, but for WiFi as well \n\nAnd finally - I strongly suspect you're not telling the full story. They treated you like an extremely inconsiderate guest, and I suspect you earned that treatment.", "In order to avoid being TA, you might consider preparing for your frequent power outrages at home. You can get recharger pads for charging electrical devices and a charger cable for your car. You could get a gas generator for yourself.  You can get camping lanterns for light in your home. You can get a camp stove, a propane heater, etc.  and flashlights.\n\nI also don\u2019t think your story is entirely credible. If your phone didn\u2019t work to call or text how did it work as a flashlight?\n\nI\u2019m sorry you have had to take on raising your grandson. That\u2019s very hard, but he\u2019s your responsibility, not you son and daughter in law who are raising their own children.", "> They kicked us out in the rain with no lights on in the house to see. We were only there for 1.5 hours and my lights came back on by that time at my address.\n\nThey didn\u2019t \u201ckick you out in the rain\u201d, they sent you home to your house where the power was back on because it was late and their children needed to be in bed. You didn\u2019t need to be there anymore, your \u201cemergency\u201d was over. \n\nStrange that your phone had no battery THAT fast? Your power went out and conveniently NOTHING was charged, all devices were already dead? Usually when someone\u2019s power goes out, it doesn\u2019t drain all their devices. None of your devices worked? You couldn\u2019t text *before* your phone or tablets all completely went out of battery??? There\u2019s usually warning like the battery symbol turning red to tell you.\u2026  That\u2019s very strange it didn\u2019t.\n\n**How did you get there? Did you drive there? You don\u2019t even have a car charger for your phone?**\n\nYour power was only out for 1.5 hours, you never even needed to leave. And yes, I\u2019m in an area where we JUST had a hurricane, and our power went out for a few hours. It\u2019s not the end of the world? You pull out your emergency flash lights and battery packs, and hunker down. If your grandson is bored, you entertain him tell him stories whatever. If it\u2019s been a while and youre worried your flash lights are running out of battery, then I can understand leaving but at any point you could text at least giving them a heads up, it really sounds like your power went out and you immediately left for their house without any warning. I don\u2019t buy that all devices were conveniently out of battery exactly when your power went out either. That\u2019s not how any of that works, you know when you are low on battery, you could have texted before your devices ALL died. \n\nYour story does not add up. \n\nWhat if their power was out too? What was the plan then?\n\nAlso you have custody of your grand child in your home, but not emergency basics like flash lights? Battery packs? And your phone is just always dead? You don\u2019t charge it when you *do* have power? That\u2019s alarming\u2026.\n\nYTA", "Okay, you're all up in your family's business, raising your grandson.

Why would she place herself in a situation where you would pawn off his care to her?\n\nThe mere fact that you son was out doing activities with their kids indicates that you were not in the middle of a hurricane, maybe prep time, but you just didn\u2019t want to be inconvenienced with a meltdown because of no Wi-Fi.  \n\nTEXT next time.   \n\nStarbucks, McDonald\u2019s, Denny\u2019s , etc. all have free Wi-Fi.   Stop and check before barging over.", "YTA if you can't make a 30 second phone call to see if everything is ok why should they do whatever you want without questions? It feels like there is a lot you haven't mentioned here.", "It was an emergency situation. I'll shelter complete strangers if such a situation arises, let alone a family member with disability. I understand she wanted alone time but considering the situation, she could've addressed MIL and the kid, ask them to take care of themselves, informed I have something going on and I'll be in my room. \n\nThe biggest AH is your son.

No one thinks that an open invitation means sho up with no warning.

This is literally what family is for.", "Why did your son shut off power to his home?", "Info: what phone do you have that only runs on Wi-Fi and why??", "TL;DR: Grandpa might be autistic, not an asshole.\n\nFrom the very limited information in the post, I suspect the special-needs grandson has autism or some form of neurodivergency. That runs in families. From tone and wording choices, plus the content of the post, I suspect the grandad has a much milder form of the same condition and this situation is largely a miscommunication.\n\nGrandad was told multiple times that he was welcome in an emergency, so in an emergency he packed up and came over, bc that was what he thought he was expected and welcome to do. \n\nFrom the post, the DIL used subtle signals to try and get grandad and grandson to leave so she can have her alone time, but if grandad is actually neurodivergent he might literally not have known she was asking him to leave if she didn't actually say those words. I am autistic and I have this problem frequently. Remember, most people say things that are polite and socially acceptable, but not necessarily true to their wants or desires. It took me a very long time to realize that these aren't actually considered lies, which is also where the comment about the son lying to him may come in. I figured out Santa wasn't real when I was 8 and it took years for me to forgive my family for lying to me. They were participating in a dearly held tradition, I felt I was being deceived for the amusement of the adults. I still feel resentment and embarrassment when I think about it and I'm freaking 32.\n\nI'm considered a level 1 or high functioning autistic; I have held a job, I've had romantic and platonic relationships, and I can feed, bathe, and dress myself (sensory issues notwithstanding). My younger sister is 12. She is level 3 autistic: nonverbal, not potty trained, can't dress herself, and regularly eats pebbles and ants. She communicates her needs through her tablet and its special apps and programs that are designed to help her function and keep her calm. My brother knocked her tablet off the table once and broke the screen, and she had violent tantrums for days bc that tablet is her lifeline to the world and the only way to get her needs met. The sand thing happens if my parents lose power or wifi. It's exactly like an anxious, neurotic toddler has lost their safety blankie.\n\nI totally understand why grandpa would have come over and stayed long past his (perceived) welcome in order to do right by his grandson. I feel some sympathy for DIL bc I get migraines and burnouts where I need to just be alone, but she should have just come out and said \"I'm very sorry, but this is not a good time. Please leave.\" From the post it sounds like there's some issue or friction in the son's family or between them and the grandad, because they are definitely acting weird.", "Does your DIL suffer from migraines? It sounds like she was experiencing an episode that required quiet and darkness.\n\nthis is not an excuse for the absolutely revolting behavior shown by both your son and DIL during an emergency.\n\nI suspect you may get an explanation at a later date, but you are correct.

They have wants and needs too.\n\nI don't see why communicating beforehand is a bad thing.  It's easy and would have been the respectful thing to do.  Hell, maybe they offered just to be nice.  \n\nJust because they didn't tell you to leave doesn't make you welcome either tbh.  \n\nAnd it kinda seems like you're weaponizing your grandson's condition.  I don't think he needs a tablet.  And using him for sympathy is kind of disgusting and toxic.", "So many other things OP has said didn\u2019t seem entirely clear how do we know the invitation is?", "Aite", "That\u2019s extremely harsh and unecessary", "He was recently uprooted from HIS parents home. He is non-verbal autistic and uses it to communicate. Keeping him out out of foster home, I believe that I am doing better. He's hasn't been with me three weeks yet.", "What an ignorant comment. Do better.", "It makes sense, parents can sign over custody to other people without the kid entering the system. If the kid doesn\u2019t enter the system the state wouldn\u2019t be providing funding, unless the kid qualified for disability", "Thank you for your input. Just really hurt by the whole thing going on. I'm definitely not using my grandson. I was put in this situation by fate because I wouldn't want any family member to put in foster system. I guess I'm really surprised by what happened.", "I had no way to communicate and I was always welcomed before. Perhaps something going on in my son's marriage that I am not aware of, he has never taken the boys out for the whole day before.", "If this was a mystery novel, I would care. This same story would get a thousand NTA replies any other time, today is just not the right day.", "Ignore that comment. Ignorance is abundant on reddit.", "If your son has never taken the kids out for the day to give him wife a break before now he needs to be a better father and husband.", "Instead of speculating, why don't you simply communicate with them?  What are you hoping for from Reddit besides sympathy?  I can't tell you the state of your family.  Neither can anyone here.  Ask them."]}
