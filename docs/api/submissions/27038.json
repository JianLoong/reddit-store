Come over, come over...even if I had power, come over anytime. I'm welcomed anytime. \n\nRemember, I have no power, no Internet connection and no wifi phone. I packed an overnight bag for my autistic grandson along with food that he likes to eat. Idk how long we will be without power. \n\nI show up, DIL, is quiet. She tells me that my 40 yr old son had to take their two younger sons out so she can have alone time. I apologize that we messed up her time. I asked her if she had everything running on the generator and she said no. \n\nAfter her movie, she does a few things and hides in her bedroom. This is the FIRST time that she met her nephew, no interest on her part to even to get to know him. \n\nMy son called me while I was at their house and said today was my DIL alone time and said I shouldn't just show up without calling.

He hung up on me after I had told him, I thought I had an open invitation. \n\nHe tells me by text that McDonald's has Wi-Fi and by the time he comes home, he is shutting off his power to his house so no Wi-Fi  for his nephew. He has his two other sons sneak upstairs and not to talk to me while we are sitting in the dark.\n\nI used the flashlight on my phone to go upstairs to say goodnight to my grandsons, as I get upstairs my DIL tells the boys to be quiet. I told my grandsons goodnight and gave them each a hug & kiss. I'm told that I'm just rowling my grandsons up, it's 7:30 PM. \n\nThey kicked us out in the rain with no lights on in the house to see. We were only there for 1.5 hours and my lights came back on by that time at my address. Normally, when we lose power, it's for days. I had texted a friend and asked if she could drive by my residence because my son has lied to me in the past.

What did your son lie to you about and why is it pertinent to this story? Why hasn\u2019t your DiL and two grandchildren at your sons house ever met the grandchild you are taking care of? Do you not have a smart phone or was it out of battery? How did he call you at his house?\n\n2. Your son and his family should have treated you better in this emergency situation.

You remained at his house when you clearly weren\u2019t wanted there. That\u2019s really bad manners.

This is literally what family is for.", "Why did your son shut off power to his home?", "Info: what phone do you have that only runs on Wi-Fi and why??", "TL;DR: Grandpa might be autistic, not an asshole.\n\nFrom the very limited information in the post, I suspect the special-needs grandson has autism or some form of neurodivergency. That runs in families. From tone and wording choices, plus the content of the post, I suspect the grandad has a much milder form of the same condition and this situation is largely a miscommunication.\n\nGrandad was told multiple times that he was welcome in an emergency, so in an emergency he packed up and came over, bc that was what he thought he was expected and welcome to do. \n\nFrom the post, the DIL used subtle signals to try and get grandad and grandson to leave so she can have her alone time, but if grandad is actually neurodivergent he might literally not have known she was asking him to leave if she didn't actually say those words. I am autistic and I have this problem frequently. Remember, most people say things that are polite and socially acceptable, but not necessarily true to their wants or desires. It took me a very long time to realize that these aren't actually considered lies, which is also where the comment about the son lying to him may come in. I figured out Santa wasn't real when I was 8 and it took years for me to forgive my family for lying to me. They were participating in a dearly held tradition, I felt I was being deceived for the amusement of the adults. I still feel resentment and embarrassment when I think about it and I'm freaking 32.\n\nI'm considered a level 1 or high functioning autistic; I have held a job, I've had romantic and platonic relationships, and I can feed, bathe, and dress myself (sensory issues notwithstanding). My younger sister is 12. She is level 3 autistic: nonverbal, not potty trained, can't dress herself, and regularly eats pebbles and ants. She communicates her needs through her tablet and its special apps and programs that are designed to help her function and keep her calm. My brother knocked her tablet off the table once and broke the screen, and she had violent tantrums for days bc that tablet is her lifeline to the world and the only way to get her needs met. The sand thing happens if my parents lose power or wifi. It's exactly like an anxious, neurotic toddler has lost their safety blankie.\n\nI totally understand why grandpa would have come over and stayed long past his (perceived) welcome in order to do right by his grandson. I feel some sympathy for DIL bc I get migraines and burnouts where I need to just be alone, but she should have just come out and said \"I'm very sorry, but this is not a good time. Please leave.\" From the post it sounds like there's some issue or friction in the son's family or between them and the grandad, because they are definitely acting weird.", "Does your DIL suffer from migraines? It sounds like she was experiencing an episode that required quiet and darkness.\n\nthis is not an excuse for the absolutely revolting behavior shown by both your son and DIL during an emergency.\n\nI suspect you may get an explanation at a later date, but you are correct.

Also talk to the social worker about access to respite care for when you feel you need some help with him.", "There's a lot in this story that doesn't make sense to me but the one thing that does seem very clear is that the relationship is incredibly strained for unknown reasons, that OP almost definitely knew this beforehand and was using the power outage as an excuse to show up, and that the family really, really did not want them there - to the degree that, if we're going by the facts as presented, they literally turned off the power to the home to get OP to leave because every other method they were trying was not working.

The person who gave the open invitation does keep the right to say, \"No, now isn't a good time to have you in my home.\" \n\nAn open invitation absolutely does NOT mean come to someone's door and walk in like you own the place. \n\nThe DIL told OP he wasn't welcome.

If that isn't a sure way of saying, \"Get out of my house!\" I don't know what is. \n\nDoes OP listen. No. The only thing OP ever heard was \"open invitation\" and seems to just ignore everything that won't benefit him. \n\nOP going upstairs to see the kids when their parents told you not to was just because OP wanted to get hugs and was for no one's benefit but his own. \n\nWhat would OP have done if the DIL and son were not an option.

Perhaps he doesn't understand why his behaviour has lead to him not being welcome anymore, but I'd put money on him coming up with reasons to impose being part of the problem here.

Addition education and knowledge is never a bad thing.", "I mean you can defend the old person driving all you like. The ones near me can barely drive in full sun. Lol.\n\nMy comment still applies. That expectation is crazy af.", "This is my take on it. I would go NTA. But son and DIL are hardcore A-holes if they acted as they did without explaining it.", "Brother, I was replying to \u2018not everyone has a cell phone\u2019 by saying they must do, because they used a torch on their phone.", "I\u2019ve actually seen some pretty heartless shit on this sub. It has a very me first fuck everyone else type of feel. OP said numerous times that they had an open invitation so not sure where you\u2019re getting this narrative that OP was in any way unwelcome.  You don\u2019t get to add your own spin to things and call it truth. Also OP never stated whether they where a man or woman.", "And OP still stayed after he did it!! Going upstairs to say goodnight to the grandsons with a flashlight after the son told OP not too. This is clearly someone who plows through boundaries.", "That's Texas, though. Its power grid is infamously terrible. And OP isn't saying that she tried to call or text, but it couldn't get through. She's saying she just headed over there.\n\nI don't know what the deal is with the family, as it sounds like there are multiple assholes in it. Where are grandson's parents? Kissing goodnight isn't \"riling up\". And if OP lives close enough to her son to drive there, why have her son's kids never met their cousin before now?\n\nBut OP *should* have made more of an effort to contact her son and DIL and let them know she needed to come.", "OP doesn't say where the son lives, but if they weren't being affected by the power outages, wouldn't OP get service as they came closer to son's/DIL's house?", "Exactly, during Harvey in Texas, we weren't sure if my cousin and my sister made it because we didn't hear from them for like 4 days. They were out when it started and it all came so quickly. Thankfully they were fine, but I don't think very many people realize it's not just not having power, cell towers can go down and then there are normally a lot more people trying to access it at the same time.", "I don't use ibuprofen but I do use another NSAID. Is it just ibuprofen? Or is it NSAIDs in general? Genuine question because I do tend to take tramadol for migraine-like headaches but I know a lot of people don't have access to that because opioid.\n\nBut for anyone who reads this and triptans don't work for you, amitriptyline at a low dose has taken me from daily debilitating headaches (around 25 days in a month) to low grade pain twice a week and migraine symptoms once a month. Life saver, honestly. I've only needed to up my dose once and it took around 6 years before I needed to go from 10mg to 20mg. (ETA: specifically for chronic headaches with migraine symptoms (like nausea and aura), not confirmed chronic migraines)", "I would need to know how old this grandparent is. Not every grandparent is 85 or 90 and someone who is 70 even is still very much able to exist in the world as a typical adult. \n\nThere\u2019s something missing here is what I\u2019m saying. NO ONE would send their family out in a hurricane if it was dangerous. It was not bad if the husband and sons were out in it.", "Yeah, without knowing the details of where she lives, what neighborhoods had their power down, etc. it's hard to know. It sounds like he had power because he was running a generator, so it's easy to imagine the service could have been down there, too.", "Not necessarily, if they live right on the outskirts of it, the cell towers could still be overwhelmed by people in that area trying to contact people inside the area of impact.", "Here is a more recent article, I hope it helps. Honestly it sucks because so many don\u2019t have access. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470171/#:~:text=Causal%20agents%20are%20varied%20and,potentially%20trigger%20medication%20overuse%20headaches.", "My daughter's neurologist said NSAIDs in general can and do cause rebound headaches/migraines. However, she said it is using them daily for several days. She couldn't give an exact number of days, but said several days in a row.", "OP would be 58 atleast based of her 40 yr old son. I'm expecting around 60-65."]}
