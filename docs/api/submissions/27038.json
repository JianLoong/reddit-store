Come over, come over...even if I had power, come over anytime. I'm welcomed anytime. \n\nRemember, I have no power, no Internet connection and no wifi phone. I packed an overnight bag for my autistic grandson along with food that he likes to eat. Idk how long we will be without power. \n\nI show up, DIL, is quiet. She tells me that my 40 yr old son had to take their two younger sons out so she can have alone time. I apologize that we messed up her time. I asked her if she had everything running on the generator and she said no. \n\nAfter her movie, she does a few things and hides in her bedroom. This is the FIRST time that she met her nephew, no interest on her part to even to get to know him. \n\nMy son called me while I was at their house and said today was my DIL alone time and said I shouldn't just show up without calling.

He hung up on me after I had told him, I thought I had an open invitation. \n\nHe tells me by text that McDonald's has Wi-Fi and by the time he comes home, he is shutting off his power to his house so no Wi-Fi  for his nephew. He has his two other sons sneak upstairs and not to talk to me while we are sitting in the dark.\n\nI used the flashlight on my phone to go upstairs to say goodnight to my grandsons, as I get upstairs my DIL tells the boys to be quiet. I told my grandsons goodnight and gave them each a hug & kiss. I'm told that I'm just rowling my grandsons up, it's 7:30 PM. \n\nThey kicked us out in the rain with no lights on in the house to see. We were only there for 1.5 hours and my lights came back on by that time at my address. Normally, when we lose power, it's for days. I had texted a friend and asked if she could drive by my residence because my son has lied to me in the past.

What did your son lie to you about and why is it pertinent to this story? Why hasn\u2019t your DiL and two grandchildren at your sons house ever met the grandchild you are taking care of? Do you not have a smart phone or was it out of battery? How did he call you at his house?\n\n2. Your son and his family should have treated you better in this emergency situation.

You remained at his house when you clearly weren\u2019t wanted there. That\u2019s really bad manners.

This is literally what family is for.", "Why did your son shut off power to his home?", "Info: what phone do you have that only runs on Wi-Fi and why??", "TL;DR: Grandpa might be autistic, not an asshole.\n\nFrom the very limited information in the post, I suspect the special-needs grandson has autism or some form of neurodivergency. That runs in families. From tone and wording choices, plus the content of the post, I suspect the grandad has a much milder form of the same condition and this situation is largely a miscommunication.\n\nGrandad was told multiple times that he was welcome in an emergency, so in an emergency he packed up and came over, bc that was what he thought he was expected and welcome to do. \n\nFrom the post, the DIL used subtle signals to try and get grandad and grandson to leave so she can have her alone time, but if grandad is actually neurodivergent he might literally not have known she was asking him to leave if she didn't actually say those words. I am autistic and I have this problem frequently. Remember, most people say things that are polite and socially acceptable, but not necessarily true to their wants or desires. It took me a very long time to realize that these aren't actually considered lies, which is also where the comment about the son lying to him may come in. I figured out Santa wasn't real when I was 8 and it took years for me to forgive my family for lying to me. They were participating in a dearly held tradition, I felt I was being deceived for the amusement of the adults. I still feel resentment and embarrassment when I think about it and I'm freaking 32.\n\nI'm considered a level 1 or high functioning autistic; I have held a job, I've had romantic and platonic relationships, and I can feed, bathe, and dress myself (sensory issues notwithstanding). My younger sister is 12. She is level 3 autistic: nonverbal, not potty trained, can't dress herself, and regularly eats pebbles and ants. She communicates her needs through her tablet and its special apps and programs that are designed to help her function and keep her calm. My brother knocked her tablet off the table once and broke the screen, and she had violent tantrums for days bc that tablet is her lifeline to the world and the only way to get her needs met. The sand thing happens if my parents lose power or wifi. It's exactly like an anxious, neurotic toddler has lost their safety blankie.\n\nI totally understand why grandpa would have come over and stayed long past his (perceived) welcome in order to do right by his grandson. I feel some sympathy for DIL bc I get migraines and burnouts where I need to just be alone, but she should have just come out and said \"I'm very sorry, but this is not a good time. Please leave.\" From the post it sounds like there's some issue or friction in the son's family or between them and the grandad, because they are definitely acting weird.", "Does your DIL suffer from migraines? It sounds like she was experiencing an episode that required quiet and darkness.\n\nthis is not an excuse for the absolutely revolting behavior shown by both your son and DIL during an emergency.\n\nI suspect you may get an explanation at a later date, but you are correct.

The person who gave the open invitation does keep the right to say, \"No, now isn't a good time to have you in my home.\" \n\nAn open invitation absolutely does NOT mean come to someone's door and walk in like you own the place. \n\nThe DIL told OP he wasn't welcome.

If that isn't a sure way of saying, \"Get out of my house!\" I don't know what is. \n\nDoes OP listen. No. The only thing OP ever heard was \"open invitation\" and seems to just ignore everything that won't benefit him. \n\nOP going upstairs to see the kids when their parents told you not to was just because OP wanted to get hugs and was for no one's benefit but his own. \n\nWhat would OP have done if the DIL and son were not an option.

Perhaps he doesn't understand why his behaviour has lead to him not being welcome anymore, but I'd put money on him coming up with reasons to impose being part of the problem here.

This seems like it's an incident with a lot of background to it. \n\nFor starters, a lot of context needs to be had about the autistic kid. Terrible I know, but autistic kids vary on their needs and problems. If the kid is nonverbal, your DIL may not really care to engage with the kid because it's not her kid, it's not her grand kid, and not her problem. It might be hard to form a relationship if any with him because a lot of internal communication comes from frankly verbalization. Without it, she's basically forming half a relationship.\n\nI'd also be curious about why he needs tablet time so much. Does it reduce behaviors? What do those behaviors look like? It could be that the kid is basically a ticking time bomb. If he is violent, I especially wouldn't want him around the kids if they were little. In some tantrums with autistic kids, they can beat on their parents but they don't care. There is a disconnect between their actions. \n\nAlso it doesn't seem like it was a major emergency if your power came back on for an hour, and the husband and kids were out. It could have seemed like an emergency to you because you have an autistic youth you are dealing with, and he gets aggressive when tablet time is not an option. \n\nAll in all, it's hard to make a real judgement or assessment on the situation because there is a lot of missing context.

I\u2019d say most people are okay with family texting asking if they can stop by later unplanned, I don\u2019t think it really needs specifying that you can - more so if you can\u2019t, it\u2019s just kind of a thing family does when they\u2019re close from time to time. Open invitation to me very much implies that they\u2019re allowed to cut out the middle man and can just come over, which is a big thing to offer but like\u2026if you\u2019re not okay with it you don\u2019t have to offer. It\u2019s also not like they just did it for jollies, there was an actual hurricane.", "or even if you have service all the capacity is used so \"your call can not be completed at this time, please try again later\"... for hours", "I\u2019m wondering if they extended the invite before they took in their grandson. If their son has an issue with the little guys parents and there\u2019s been some bad blood caused because of the Grandma taking their child in and therefore the invite is no longer extended?", "Exactly, you can be annoyed by this but usually people don\u2019t act like this even when their family (or anyone, really) has inconvenienced them, just wait it out and have a chat when the situation is over.", "Younger people in areas that always have service can\u2019t conceive of the fact that some areas are not all 5g all the time it\u2019s actually wild", "Actually, texting is typically the only thing that will get through in an emergency.   It doubting OP, just that your comment is not that accurate.", "WiFi", "We live in a service black hole. Up until we had switched to more reliable high speed internet, I couldn't receive calls at home and regularly couldn't send or receive texts. We had to have a landline so I could be contacted by school/doctors/family. With the new high speed I can rely completely on wifi calling at home, enough that we canceled our landline. An unfortunate side effect is I now get tons of telemarketing calls that never went through before.", "Say it for the people in the back! Bloody hell, what's there not to understand. \n\nOn holiday I only use wifi because it costs \u00a35 a day to roam. Come on people. Even if you didn't understand, a bunch of people have already explained that wifi calling without electricity cannot be done. SMH.", "Yeah this is wild to me. If someone doesn\u2019t have power, and I know them, they are welcome at my house to regroup and come up with a plan. Fuck I don\u2019t even have to know you during a Hurricane, you\u2019re welcome to stay.\n\nSome people love claiming they have Southern Hospitality until it comes time to dole out that Southern Hospitality.\n\nShameful behavior, unless we aren\u2019t being told the whole story.", "I wonder if the DIL was ill or was up to her neck or on her last nerve so that is why hubby and sons left to give her some alone time. I'm usually pretty open about people coming by but if this was like the first 'alone' time in months (or more) and then your MIL and nephew shows up I'd be pissed. Like \"I just want one day to myself and when I get it, my MIL shows up?\"", "An uncle of mine did something super similar. He had unrelated serious life problems going on combined with being a dick in general.", "She also said she asked her neighbors about her power because her son has lied to her before, so seems the open invitation isn\u2019t actually open.", "I\u2019ve got some completely insane and toxic family members so the only thing that makes sense is that there is a lot of drama OP didn\u2019t cover.  The 100% innocent version and clueless as to the \u201cwhy\u201d behind her child acting that way doesn\u2019t add up.", "Bruh, the Robin's donuts near me literally put out psa's that they had a generator and to come there if you needed shelter. It's not that farfetched", "After Hurricane Sandy, our power was out for over a week. My friends .3 miles away never lost power or only for a few hours.  I took our aquarium to them to plug in and then my kids and dogs got out of Dodge.", "The problem with that is that if the reader doesn't think OP is a reliable narrator, the reader won't trust OP's answers to INFO questions.\n\nI would agree that the initial response is making assumptions. But I would agree that OP is an unreliable narrator, and potentially lacks empathy. They explain their position, but give almost no weight to anyone else's experience of things, which \\*may\\* mean that they are not a thoughtful houseguest.", "I don't understand this response. He acted in an emergency, and accepted an invitation that was given for said emergency. He couldn't have given a heads-up cos his phone was down. In your comment you mentioned your power was off for a week so you are aware that he moved because he assumed it would be longer than a couple of hours.", "The son came home and turned HIS OWN power off to the house, the wife said they weren't using a generator. They did this so the autistic kid would be scared and have no wifi. They were trying to force them out. And they did it immaturely, they should have been straight up about it and not beat around the bush.\n\nThere maybe be other things at play, but they still should have just said it.", ">Surely it\u2019s what the \u201copen\u201d means?\n\nI always thought so, too.  Never made this distinction in my life.", "This definitely reads to me like they have an issue with the grandson, it\u2019s surprising that so few people seem to have mentioned it?", "I have a relative who tells me she loves me, and would do anything for me, all I have to do is ask, etc etc etc.\n\nIt's all bullshit, of course. But I only found out it was bullshit when I took her at her word, and asked her to help me out. That relative exploded with rage, called me selfish, and said, \"Why should I be expected to do that for you?\" Umm, because you just offered? And you could have just said no?\n\nI wonder if the DIL's open invitation wasn't really sincere, and it was more about the DIL feeling good about herself and looking good to others. But like I did, the OP took the DIL at her word and didn't understand that it was a form invitation only, and DIL never intended for OP to actually take her up on it.", "Or it could be like me- live in the boonies with no cell signal outside of wifi.", "Fairly certain we lived in the same state, and there were some hurricanes that took out power and everything with it for 2 weeks. Admittedly, I lived in a pretty rural area there, too. I like my space \ud83d\ude02", "Floridian here, the entire tower typically has multiple carriers antenna and one shared generator.   The internet is like dial up version 1, like forget using it.  Calls may or may not go through and if signal was poor it's worse now because the actual transmitting power is reduced. That's even in a situation where it's just losing power and not a devastating event. Just thought I would clarify that.  \n\nCompletely couldn't use the internet, couldn't text and making a call took quite a bit of time to go through so don't put your money on things working like they do when there's no power outage.", "Yes it is. During hurricanes, the wind blows. The towers LITERALLY go down. To the ground. We\u2019re not talking about one blown transformer, ENTIRE GRIDS go down. It took two days for cell service after Ida. And we were on a big grid.", "During and after Ian I could only text and even that was unreliable.  Half the time people would respond right away but I would get it hours later.", "During an emergency that affects a geographical area, even if the cell towers HAVE power, they are going to be overwhelmed with people trying to use them. Cell towers operate very much on a '90% of our customers don't all call at the same time' kind of budgeting, like all private owned infrastructure. It's cheaper.", "We've had signal loss on cell phones before because the power loss caused other issues and knocked the towers offline. They still had power but were unconnected until they were reset. Could be the case here.", "Last migraine I put on Midsommer Murders. I have seen it so many times, I can picture all the quaint little English villages and quirky vickers, landed gentry, and pub owners in my head..", "Ken Burns documentaries are one of my go tos for falling asleep", "Other commenters have indicated \"missing missing reasons\" and I think that may be apt here. \n\nThe fact that OP feels like they were given an open invitation, but the son/DIL have never met their nephew, and they seemed to shoo their children past OP shows me that things are probably not going well in their relationship.", "Also in a dead zone. I\u2019ve got shit hot wifi and one bar of cell service. I wouldn\u2019t have known this was possible prior to living here so I\u2019ll give the commenters a pass", "u/zombiemiki u/AncientBlonde2 this entire comment section is surprisingly civil but your interaction stood out the most to me. Just a really kind back-and-forth about a misunderstanding on Reddit", "After Katrina my parents, sister, and niece loaded into the car and drove to my house. They had no power, no water, no cell service. As they crossed the state line they finally got cell service and left me a message that they were on the way. Prior to that there was no way they could contact me. They were 2 hours from home when they finally got a signal. I got home from work that afternoon and they got to my house 15 minutes later. I welcomed them in for the next two weeks until they had both power and water again. Sometimes with storms all means of communication go away.", "Yea my parents keep their land line just for this reason.", "yep, limited lines and they're all constantly tied up. as if calling the power company is going to magically reconnect your power faster", "Reddit was about the only thing that sort of worked during the first big ice storm, and even that was iffy. I think I would have lost my mind without that narrow window to my fellow Texans.", "All phones on the east coast got a busy signal on 9/11 from the high demand.", "> It has a very me first fuck everyone else type of feel.\n\nThis is true, but there's no \"me first\" here. A lot of people on AITA are posting about people that only care about their own reasons for why they do things. But in this situation, we have no reasons at all. There's a difference between \"I'm doing this because (selfish reason)\" and \"I'm doing this for literally no reason\".\n\nWhen it comes to rocky parent/child relationships, it's kind of common for the parent to actively pretend not to know the reasons why their child isn't happy with them because if they acknowledge those reasons they might have to confront their own behavior. That's why people are skeptical of this OP - it's not believable that the son and DIL did all this for literally zero reason at all, and it's suspicious that OP hasn't provided any reasons. What's more likely? That OP's son and DIL are just cruel people that enjoy watching OP suffer and have been building up a long con in hopes that something like this would happen so they can kick them out in the rain? Or that son and DIL have a reason that OP is choosing not to share? And if it's the latter, why do you think OP is choosing not to share it?"]}
