We're both from the US, but we met abroad. Before I met him, I decided I wanted to return to school in the US. When we got serious, he asked me to stay, and I put my schooling on hold.\n\nWe moved back to the US and live about a 6-hour drive from his family. My boyfriend always wanted to live in the area, so we agreed to try it out for a few years. We live close enough that his parents can visit frequently, and he can quickly fly back to see them when he wants. I am currently taking classes, and things are looking good.\n\nMy bf's parents called a few days before Christmas and told him they wanted to visit for the holidays. He told them I was renting the extra room because his parents are conservative and they don't know about our relationship. The day after Christmas, his dad gets a call and has to return to work, but his mom decides to stay. She has cancer and wants to spend time with her eldest son. I thought things were fine until his dad called yesterday.\n\nMy bf's dad told him his mom felt better here because the weather was nice, and she could relax. His dad pointed out that they wanted to visit more as a family (his brother, sister, and nieces) and that it would be crowded with me here. So his dad suggested that my bf get the extra room back and have me leave. His dad told him his mom had more energy here, and it was for her health.\n\nMy bf told me what his dad wanted on our way to buy groceries and thought of some solutions. One is for me to move back to my parent's place ( my parents live on the opposite side of the country) and have a long-distance relationship while his parents visit. He tried to soften the blow by saying the flights are cheap if we plan ahead and that my classes are offered online.\n\nThe other solution he thought of involves our friend. Our friend is having an interview in our area and plans to move into our building if he gets the position. My bf suggested that if our friend moved here, I could stay with him. Which is ridiculous, and I almost lost it. \n\nI didn't speak to him on our way back. When we got home, I went into the extra bedroom, and he hung out with his mom until she went to bed. \n\nI understand that his mom is sick, and I want to do what's right for her. However, a part of me thinks we wouldn't be in this mess if he told his parents about us. I also feel that it is unfair that I have to derail my life again. I pushed back going to school and stuck with the job I disliked because he asked me to stay. I feel like I am making more sacrifices and have been more accommodating about his needs and feelings.\n\nI'm unsure of what to do.\n\nAITA for wanting to tell my bf I don't want to leave and have him figure out his family?", "created_utc": 1703792945, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18t2qhe/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_i_dont_want_to_move/", "score": 102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He obviously doesn't care for you at all to decide this without your input because lets face it he has decided.", "Are you on the lease?", "Imagine you were, actually, just the tenant you're pretending to be, living with another guy and splitting the rent and bills because it's cheaper and can be good to have a roommate.  Imagine that your landlord then proposed to abruptly kick you out with very little notice for an indeterminate amount of time, interfering with your education and life plans.\n\nImagine the dollar amount you'd be asking your landlord for in exchange for breaking the lease like that.  Imagine the angry emails and googling of \"your state's rental laws\" you'd be doing right now.\n\nWhat about \"his being your boyfriend and therefore in theory in love with you\" makes this huge lapse of normal civility any more okay?\n\nYou're NTA.  But this guy is telling you that his remaining closeted to his family is more important to him than you are.", "NTA. You are both in your 30s and your boyfriend is behaving like a child by not being honest about his relationship and standing up for you. If I were in your shoes I'd say that moving out would mean the end of the relationship.

You deserve better than a 35 year old who's too scared to come out to his parents and tell them who you are.", "Your bf is the AH. He's still lying to his parents at almost 40", "NTA \ud83d\udea9  I think you need to get back on track with school. Move back so you can find a job, place to live, etc.. and get started with your life. You will always come last with this guy, if he was serious he would've  told his parents", "NTA. In your place I'd get a place for myself close to school and leave the bf who can't even bother to come clean to his parents about you being his partner. Do not try to finish school online, that's never as good if you have the in person option. Don't compromise your life for him again. \n\nI'd ask if you would even want to share your home with all of them if your bf does admit that you live \"with\" him? If his parents can afford it, THEY can get a nearby place instead of living with you all.", "This sucks.  But your boyfriend is an adult and has not come out to his parents. And he would rather kick you to the curb than to be honest with them.  It's time to stop making decisions about your life based on his convenience.  Tell him that he can move out and find a place to live with his parents.  Then, finish up your degree and do what you want to do.\n\nThis relationship is doomed.

You should tell his mom that you do not live in the spare room and never have.", "NTA\n\nThat's your home.  Your BF is wrong to ask you to leave.\n\nBut if he truly wants you to go, there's no reason to fight it.  He'll choose his family every time.  If your name is on the lease, insist he has to get the landlord to release you from the lease and take on full responsibility for the remaining lease and any fees for the change.\n\nAfter you're moved out, break things off with this guy.  He doesn't respect you or your relationship enough to stand up for as even a roommate.\n\nBTW, unless they're exceptionally wealthy, it's unlikely that his Mom will be able to get cancer treatments in the U.S.  They would need insurance or cash to get seen by most non-emergency providers.  They may not realize that, in which case, Mom and Dad would have to leave soon for her treatment.  Or she may be planning to stay until she dies.", "NTA.  It's time to start thinking long term.

Right now all you're doing is fucking around and treading water.", "NTA but he's creating this mess by not being honest. Conservative family members can suck. But he is an adult in his 30s. If he hasn't had the stones to come out yet, staying with him means you will always be the perpetual dirty secret. You deserve better than that. \n\nMove back home and start fresh. New Year, new beginnings. Best of luck OP. I hope you find a partner who will be able to treat you as more than a dirty secret, no matter how crappy his family is.", "NTA.  He is being completely unreasonable.  He needs to tell his parents about you.  If he wont and insists you leave, you should break up with him.", "NTA - it's high time your BF comes clean and tells his parents you're living together. Yeah, they probably won't like it but that's just too bad, you're in your 30's for crying out loud. **He can't ask you to move out if you can't ask him to tell them the truth.** If he refuses, make sure she hears you say \"I'm your girlfriend & I'm not moving out, tell them the truth\".", "NTA-- He is 35 and is independente of his parents.

And this is their last ditch effort to \"Change their son\"....And it is working.\n\nSorry you are being treated like this. Noone deserves to be punished for loving someone.", ">He told them I was renting the extra room because his parents are conservative and they don't know about our relationship.\n\nSo...your boyfriend is closeted and, by default with his family, you are as well?\n\nY'all are in your mid-30s and putting up with this b.s.? \n\nYou've already derailed your life for him once with your schooling.

You have been together 3 YEARS, and his parents have no idea that you are not only a couple, but you live together.

His family will crowd you out either way, so move and reevaluate your relationship", "NTA. Tell him sure you can move out, but he better be ok with not seeing or hearing from you ever again if you do. Or he can finally sprout a spine and realize that he's grown so he doesn't have to pander to his parents so they can be all comfy in their ways. Personally, I'd do the former. If he won't buck up for himself and you, then you're better off starting fresh and doing for yourself. He suggested going the extra step, now he wants you to jump off of it so mommy and daddy won't have a frowny fit. It's your turn to make a kick-in-the-blueberries suggestion and see how he likes it.", "Hadn\u2019t thought of that\u2026.you might have a point here", "Oh shit! My apologies!"]}
