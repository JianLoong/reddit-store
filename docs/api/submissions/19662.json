The girl had been distant from us lately mostly because she told she got a crush on a boy in school but wouldn\u2019t say who, for a long time she became inactive in our group chat, maybe sending a text or two every month or so. They had been hiding their relationship until summer started. We all knew she was dating someone, but she didn't tell us who. \n\nThe guy she is with is not part of our friend group but he\u2019s generally really chill and I\u2019ve never had any issues with him, he doesn\u2019t stand out much in school but it could be worse. The problem was that once they started holding hands and posting each other on ig my IG, my friend got really bitter about it and started calling her a \"snow bunny\" in private messages because of the race of the guy she is dating and making small inappropriate jokes, he said never said anything about the guy, just about her, I asked him and he said \u201cim not judging him for dating her, im judging her for dating him\u201d or some bs like that, he also said he is worried the dude smokes cigarettes or something even though that\u2019s hypocritical because my friend does too. \n\nWhat happened next was that he planned a small get-together for our friend group since his birthday is next week. He made a chat that includes me, about 2 girls, 3 guys from our grade, his cousin and a couple friends from his middle school, the idea was that we would all go out to drink and etc\u2026 The girl he likes said she couldn't go, and then my friend confronted her about it in a really bitter way by saying something like \"why can't you just make time for us? You rather hang out with your boyfriend rather than your friends right?\" or something like that. It was pretty awkward but he brought up race or anything so ig that is better than I expected him to act really, and they an argument, well in reality it was just him going on about her having \u201cabandoned\u201d us and her replying with \u201cok\u201d and \u201cokay\u201d keep in mind my friend isn\u2019t unpopular or a bad looking by any means if he wanted to get with a girl in school he probably could do it very easily, just not this specific girl, and yet he insists on it. Anyways he asked one of the other girls named Violet to kick Alize (the girl the girl he likes) out of our main groups group chat and so she did without ever consulting and this led to an argument over how fucking childish he is acting rn and yet Violet defends him, \n\nI tried calling him out but it\u2019s impossible, not everyone has to deal with his bitter over the fact a girl picked a minority over him. Now I def understand why he is sad about all of this and I can mentally but not socially justify the way he is acting because, yeah but I still don't think that gives him the right to act like this.
