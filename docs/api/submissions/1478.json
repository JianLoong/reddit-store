She says she needs a few weeks to see places in person because rental scams are a big deal here and is twice as hard to find a place that accepts a dog as big as her's. She also says she can't afford deposit+rent+moving, she'll need at least a paycheck to do it but she had good savings when she left. She's also very angry at me because when I fell in hard times she let me move in with her even though she wasn't ready to live together (we were 4 months in) and how I owe it to her because of that but I believe this is a different thing and I never promised that I would let her move in, just that I'd help her.", "created_utc": 1667619735, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymj7am/aita_for_not_letting_my_ex_fianc\u00e9e_to_stay_with/", "score": 5, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Where are you living while renting out your place? Why can\u2019t you screen/visit places for her to rent. You thought you were just helping out by picking her up at the airport! and she thought she would be living with you? Communication breakdown", "You were supposed to clarify that \"help\", and she was supposed to explain. You assumed she needed a ride, and she assumed you would give her a place to stay.\n\nBut I must ask, how can you talk about her as your fiancee and say that you will spend the rest of your life with her, but you refuse to let her stay with you? \n\nConsidering your age and that you are engaged for 3 years, sharing a room/bed wouldn't be unusual. Or am I missing something here?\n\nESH", "I'd say NTA. When she asked you for \"help\" that was the time for her to mention that she needed a place to live. It's not like you can just call the people who already agreed to rent from you and tell them they don't have a place to stay now!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm staying at someone else's house for a fraction of what I'll earn (that house was meant to be an Airbnb but it wasn't renting so we stayed instead). That's the \"compromise\" we got to, I'll help her to find a place before she arrives but she still says she's very hurt because I'm not helping her as she did to me and she'll have to get a loan to survive till her first paycheck. I do realise now that none of us said what we meant and was a mistake.", "Besides the place is rented for a few days in December, I feel is to soon for us to be together again, I'm happy with my life how it is right now and she hasn't worked out the things she has to fix properly, besides getting a diagnosis for her mental health she hasn't done any of the other things I ask for her.", "Thank you! She swears she'll find a place before they arrive but I know her, she'll become complacent and won't move out on time."]}
