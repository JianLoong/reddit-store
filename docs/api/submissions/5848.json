So, I've tried to get used to it and he kindly does it a little less often. For my favorite artists he won't sing along at all so I can enjoy the music. Try to have a serious conversation about compromising on this, because demanding that he stop singing along will continue to be unproductive.\n\nIf you push for him to stop singing along completely then yes, YWBTA. It comes off as controlling to demand that someone not ever sing out loud in your presence because you don't like their voice and singing style. Serious question: does he really act like a baby, or are you just upset that he won't do as you say?", "Info Why not one up him?? Do a sing off, sound even more off key than him and see what happens??", "It all depends on how you ask. \u201cSTFU\u201d takes you into asshole territory", "NTA. I was gonna go with N-A-H until I saw some of your comments- he gets sulky and petulant, gives you the silent treatment, and compares you to his ex when you ask him to respect other boundaries? That's concerning.\n\nIn a vacuum, this should be N-A-H. My best friend loves to sing along to music in the car. I absolutely hate when people sing along with music, for similar misophonic reasons. When we go on short trips together (she drives, I don't have a license) I keep it to myself because it's her car and plus she gets joy from it and I love her and want her to have that, even if she'd be willing to stop singing if I asked. When we went on a vacation together that was several hours away, we took separate modes of transport because I wouldn't be able to deal with her singing and I wouldn't want to ask her to stop doing something she loves. We're still best friends, because we find ways to respect each others' boundaries.\n\nIt's possible that he can be reasoned with and maybe you could compromise- travel separately, or agree that you do trips about half his way (singing) and half your way (no singing). But if he gets pouty and manipulative, ask yourself is he really only doing this about singing in the car? Or is he going to get like this about every conflict you have?", "NAH, but hopefully you can find a compromise that suits both of you since it's obviously something he enjoys", "soft YTA cuz i get it but. idk what to tell you bud singing along to music is fun and telling someone their fun is annoying you is pretty much always gonna be hurtful.", "NTA. A bit of singing every once in while would be fine, but I imagine it gets annoying quickly enough no matter how much you love him. He's the AH for making you feel bad about asking to turn it down for a bit.", "NTA. I totally get you. I have sensory issues so it literally physically hurts me sometimes when someone is singing loudly like this right next to me. I get trying to be a good sport/killjoy, but maybe he can get a shower speaker and take his performances to a more private place. You\u2019re not required to be his audience and you\u2019re entitled to feel comfortable and sit and peacefully listen to music too.", "YTA, I can\u2019t sing at all, but I belt out songs with passion because I want to", "NTA and the comments here are hilarious, you\u2019re taking it in good stride \n\nNothing more annoying than someone RELENTLESSLY hamming it up and then looking for validation, like ok \n\nIt\u2019s one thing if everyone\u2019s singing, obviously, but if it\u2019s just him in a car with two other people who aren\u2019t joining in and he won\u2019t stop after like five songs , yeah he is the asshole \n\nPlus he knows you have sensory issues, that\u2019s just inconsiderate \n\n(One or two songs, ok whatever)\n\nI say, be honest *with reassurance* -  \u201cbabe I love YOU so much but can we take a break for a bit, the singing is driving me nuts right now\u201d\n\nEdit: ok if you think he\u2019ll take that personally you could try \u201cthere\u2019s too much sound for my sensory issues\u201d\n\nEdit: both my boyfriend and I sing and even then he drives me nuts with it sometimes", "NTA but I think you guys are probably super incompatible. He loves it, you hate it. Either you're going to have to suck it up and let him sing because he loves it, or he's going to have to accept the fact that he's just not allowed to sing anymore. \n\nOr, you know, you find a healthy middle ground by openly and honestly communicating with your partner (you're not an asshole for telling him his singing is bad, you're only an asshole if you shame him for it or if you convince him to give up singing completely.) My recommendation? Look into singing lessons, go on karaoke dates. Turn on songs specifically for him to sing to. Set boundaries, communicate your frustrations. If your BF loves it, he shouldnt have to give it up just because hes bad at it. He does, however, have to be reasonable. I love to cook but I'm shit at it. I'm trying to get better, but I don't force my family to eat everything I make. If I make something awful and they don't want to eat it, hey, fine by me! Does it hurt a little bit? Yeah, of course it does. But my family isn't entitled to pretend to love everything I concoct just to inflate my ego. They know how much I love to do it, and when they encourage me to keep going, shit it feels really good! And sometimes I make something edible and that's the greatest feeling in the world! \n\nYou and your boyfriend have to have reasonable expectations for each other. Don't expect him to completely shut up, but he can't expect you to willingly subject yourself to his caterwauling whenever he wants. \n\nAnd seriously, if he's pouting EVERY time you ask him to stop... Yikes. That's a serious sign of immaturity. Reconsider the relationship if his ego is so fragile that he gets butthurt everytime you ask him to stop. It's okay to be bad at something.", "NTA. Had a guy do this ALL the time too, drove me nuts. He could sing well, so that wasn't the issue, but sometimes you just want to hear the music! I never found a way to broach it with him, so good luck with that OP!", "NAH\n\nMan the sound of someone singing along to the music that's playing gets on my nerves like nothing else. It drove me nuts when my ex did that (he's a horrible singer/rapper) and it drove me nuts when my best friend does that (she's one of the best singers I have EVER come across. Sometimes her voice is better than the actual singer's might have been without the instruments or the auto-tunes) Doesn't matter. It grates me on the nerves so hard, I felt like jumping out of the car.\n\nBut tbh, its a bit of a 'me' problem too. This is something you guys need to work out. And you need to decide if this is a hill you want to die on. Personally, I'd suggest try to find some middle ground.\n\nTalk to him (maybe without the stfu comment) and explain your point. Do a his car, he sings, your car, you both listen kind of rule or let him jam during some drives and go for a quieter ones on others. \n\nOr if nothing, get noise cancelling earphones (if you aren't driving) so you listen to your music and he does his live concert! (That helped me with my ex's case)\n\nOne thing that helped me in this situation with my bestie, which I HIGHLY do not advice, is me singing out and jamming along, at full volume too. Like really getting into the singing part. When I sing, I sound like a walrus in labour, so yeah, my problem was solved when SHE suggested we just listened at times.", "NTA\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how good someone is at singing, there are times when you just want to sit in the car quietly and relax. \n\nI suggest you have an honest conversation about how it makes you feel when you tell him to tone it down and he seems to ignore you. I love singing but this would drive me mad.", "NTA. If he is not the driver, then his singing is distracting the driver. Tell him to stop, for safety reasons. If he pouts like a child, then tell him no music will be played at all.", "NAH Sometimes you just want to listen to the music and not to the performance. He must learn that not everything is a personal attack. Always walking on egg-shells because the partner is over sensitive just build up resentment.", "NTA. That\u2019s something he can do alone. With anyone else in the car, it\u2019s pretty rude and inconsiderate. That includes you too - I\u2019m right there with you, I just want to hear the music, not the driver\u2019s interpretation of it.", "I dont think anyone is really the AH here, you're allowed to not enjoy his impromptu concerts as much as he's allowed to give them because he enjoys it. But you do need to realize that by doing that youre crapping on something he enjoys and are opening yourself up for the same. So I hope you're perfect at everything and aren't easily offended when he asks you to stop baking or cooking or painting or watching that one show he hates, or whatever it is you enjoy but is probably a mild annoyance for him. So maybe think about just ignoring it for short car trips and feigning a headache on long ones.", "NTA. Let him sing a long. Its really good for the nervous system \ud83d\ude01\n\nSorry revising this,why don't people add all relevant info to their op!\n\nStill think he should be allowed to sing but given your noise sensitivity, it seems a dickish move on his part when you ask for a break from it", "No judgment here, but I\u2019m just going to say years ago when my now husband were dating before I was incredibly annoyed with his singing. I had a meltdown over it one time (now I know I have sensory processing issues) and we broke up for a variety of reasons. Years later we came back together and I\u2019d listen to his singing any time. What changed was me. He is my best friend and seeing his pure joy while he\u2019s singing now greatly outweighs my sensory issues and overwhelm. He is being his authentic self and it\u2019s beautiful. Just a different perspective.", "NTA. You are literally his captive audience!", "NTA, I totally get you. I consider myself calm in most situation, but hearing unwanted singing voice from someone, or even professional music that I don't like somehow makes me very irritate that I have violence thought (never did it btw). I usually try to leave or block it with other noise.", "Waaaay back when I was in college I went on a road trip from Boston to Florida with a guy I was seeing. His car, his music, and he sang to every song the entire way and back. Twenty plus hours each direction of him belting out every lyric. It was the olden days so he had cassette tapes and sometimes the lyrics were on the j-card. If I was driving, he'd bust those suckers out and read along to make sure he didn't miss a word. \n\nHe was also a huge Ayn Rand fan. \n\nMy interest in him didn't survive either.\n\nI don't think this is an insurmountable issue in a relationship, and if you are going to address it, you'll have to do so with kindness to not be the AH. That said, I'm quite glad that my husband and I never sing above the music and never for more than a few minutes at most.", "INFO: Have you had a good talk with him about how much it annoys you and have you looked for a compromise (e.g. only 1 song an hour or something like that).", "NTA, would wreck my head too. Maybe try podcasts for long journeys, find some genre you both like - avoids the temptation for him to sing", "NAH. I don't like people singing very much either.", "NTA far from it, but just actually talk to your partner about it. Tell him it annoys you, tell him why.", "YTA you're making him feel like shit for enjoying himself.", "NTA. But neither is he... Maybe you don't belong together right now?", "Info: are you the one driving?\n\nIf so, then NTA. Having someone screaming in the car while you\u2019re driving is dangerously distracting, and it\u2019s not fair of him to have fun at your expense when you\u2019re already doing him a favor and going through the annoyance of having to drive. \n\nIf not, then I think a good pair of headphones is the best bet.\n\nEdit: just saw that you have misophonia and your boyfriend is definitely aware that this is a huge trigger for you. HUGE NTA and your boyfriend is being outright cruel.", "Op, get some earplugs and let the man sing", "NAH. He wants to sing, you don't want him to sing. When you're not there, he can sing. When you are there, he doesn't sing. Very easy fix and if he's not willing to do that then you've got bigger problems than just singing.", "YTA and probably no fun at parties\u2026I hope ur bf finds someone who supports his terrible car karaoke \ud83d\ude24", "I wouldn't necessarily say YTA, but as someone who loves singing along to music, being told that would crush my feelings. I know you don't like it, but sometimes we have to endure things we don't like because we love the person doing them. If that's absolutely not going to happen for you, maybe try talking to them about it kindly, and seeing if you can reach a deal, i.e. only singing on the return trip, and just listening on the way there, or having 5 songs they're allowed to sing along with per trip, or something similar. Just approach it gently. I still remember how crushed, embarrassed, and unwanted I felt with my ex told me he didn't want me to sing along to songs. Literally part of the reason I broke up with him.", "YTA. Just put on your own music with earbuds or something if it really bothers you that much.", "[removed]", "NTA.

I think the immortal words of the choirmaster of Hamilton Children\u2019s Choir right before my 8 yr old was kicked out of the choir, \u201cSinging is a passion that lies in everyone.

I'll be doing dishes and trying to enjoy some tunes, and here comes my husband, singing along loudly. Hate it. I want to listen to the music, not him.

Don\u2019t steal his joy. If you don\u2019t like it, break up.

My partner has ruined some songs in particular because of this. He's entitled to have fun and sing sure, but when it's at the expense of someone else's enjoyment or comfort, then the person who's ears are being constantly assaulted has every right to voice their discomfort at the expense of the singer.

I am not musically gifted and am a bad singer, but love to sing along. \n\nYears ago when we\u2019d only been together for a bit he asked me not to sing because \u201cHe wanted to hear the professional singers\u201d. It seriously hurt my feelings and the message I took was that my joy was annoying. I stopped singing around him. \n\nDecades later (we\u2019ve been together 30 years) I don\u2019t remember why it came up, could have been me apologizing for singing, and basically he asked why I wasn\u2019t singing ever and I told him he told me it bothered him and he didn\u2019t want to hear me\u2026 he was surprised that this had effected me for so long. \n\nYou and my husband might mean that singing off key bothers you and you want to hear the music, but what I heard is that my joy and presence were annoying and I needed to be quiet and not bother him. \n\nIs it fair for him to always be belting it out, probably not. Is it fair for you to tell him you don\u2019t want to ever hear him sing and he annoys you, also no. The better option would be to take it on a case by case basis. Some days let him sing. And the days you really need him to not sing because is too much for you, don\u2019t focus on his lack of ability or wanting \u201cto hear the professional\u201d instead focus on you, \u201cHey I\u2019m feeling distracted/overwhelmed/have a headache coming on could we just have some mellow music today.\u201d", "This is an underrated comment.", "Just sent this one to my bf \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 tho I consider my voice of song my shared resource so tbh he should be grateful?", "Ha ha\ud83d\ude00", "Notice how you said offend and I said annoy?
