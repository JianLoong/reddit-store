It\u2019s something my wife and I agreed on early in our relationship. We both have pretty good jobs and are able to afford many expensive items and activities. I attribute this to our jobs obviously, but also the fact that we are child free and live in a one bedroom apartment. I own a manufacturing plant that was given to me from my father. On that property, I store 4 classic cars that I have bought/restored. I have always been a car guy. I plan to buy another car in the next year too. \n\nI have one sister who is younger than me and never made the best decisions in life. She has a boyfriend who she lives with after getting divorced twice. She\u2019s also in her early 40s. She has 2 kids who already seem smarter than their mom. She makes an okay living but she\u2019s the breadwinner. Her bf that she lives with spends most of his time stoned and playing Xbox. He\u2019s always \u201clooking for a new job\u201d. Or blaming \u201cthe capitalist system\u201d for him not having a job. \n\nHer daughter (10) is a very good singer. I don\u2019t have an ear for talent but to me She is very good. My sister has wanted to enroll her in lessons with a private coach but cannot afford it. She has asked me to help her out since she is embarrassed to ask our parents. She also does not speak to the father of her daughter. I declined politely until she made a comment about my money and cars, just another \u201cmust be nice\u201d comment I\u2019m all too sick of hearing. Here is where I made my asshole comment. \n\nI said \u201cMaybe if your boyfriend can put down the dope for all of 10 minutes he can help you out\u201d and \u201cI have 5 cars I\u2019ll buy another 5 before I give you a dime\u201d. I said her daughter isn\u2019t my responsibility. She\u2019s got a mother and a father and if they can\u2019t figure it out it doesn\u2019t fall on my shoulders. \n\nMy sister called my wife and told her \u201chow mean\u201d I was to her. My wife now wants us to give the money, but I don\u2019t want to. Sure we can afford it but I\u2019m not my sisters welfare. Last bit, I\u2019m sure some of you will make a comment about how I refer to her daughter or my niece. They live in another state and have for the entirety of her life. I don\u2019t see my sister or her kids much at all. I don\u2019t really know her kids too well. I send them birthday and Christmas gifts but I\u2019m not close with them.\n\nEdit: this is coming up a lot in comments. My sister could have had a stake in the business but she didn\u2019t want to work there. I\u2019ve worked for my dad all my life and learned the business. She never did. She knew she wouldn\u2019t be getting anything with it and she was okay with that.\n\nEdit: I have given financial support to her before and I\u2019ve decided to pay for nieces lessons directly", "created_utc": 1678115896, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11k1le8/aita_for_what_i_said_to_my_sister_after_she/", "score": 5350, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are of course not at all obligated, but if your niece would enjoy it, consider setting up the lessons yourself and paying the teacher/school directly.

She made her decision and has to accept the consequences. And you were a bit harsh but perhaps someone needs to be since she chooses deadbeat men over providing for her children.

It\u2019s not even something she needs (like fukin food or a little rent one month) it\u2019s dance lessons??! Her daughter can have a friend over and watch an instructor on YouTube for free. Or the mom can save a few months to begin putting her in classes.", "NTA, she made her bed and has other options she just doesn\u2019t want to try before hounding you for money, but I gotta ask, what are the cars? I\u2019m also a car guy lol.", "YTA for what you said, not that you didn't want to give your sister money.  You can say 'No' with being an AH about it.  Yes, people make different life choices and have consequences as a result, but acting superior to your sister was definitely an AH move.", "NTA, and tell your wife that this is a dealbreaker and not up for further discussion. Sometimes you have to give a hard no, and this is clearly one of those times.", "YTA for saying what you said.  You don't get to make judgments on her decisions, just like she doesn't get to make judgments on yours.  If her \"must be nice\" comments bother you, you can always tell her you don't appreciate her trying to make you feel guilty for success.  It is not  a license for you to tell her all the things you think she's doing wrong.  Keep that shit to yourself.\n\nHowever, you are NTA for refusing.  \"No.\" is a complete sentence.", "NTA, for a few reasons.  You\u2019re not all that close, for starters.  I may be assuming a bit, but she seems to have a poor track record with picking men and it costs her financially.  You pointing out that her boyfriend is a bum is ugly, but it is also a fact.  There\u2019s a small chance that what you said will get through to her and she might make some changes.  \n\nWhat kind of weighs on my mind is the niece.  While I realize that you\u2019re not responsible for her, I think about the influences she has at home.  Your sister might be an ok mom, but what the niece sees is that clinging on to a mediocre man and letting him sponge off you is ok.  That the boyfriend shows her it\u2019s ok to be a lazy slob.  If I could afford to give her an opportunity to succeed, I would, in the hopes it would guide her to making better choices.  I\u2019d for sure pay it directly to the coach or facility though.", "NTA. If you wanted to make it a gift for maybe a holiday or a birthday, then sure, go for it. But it\u2019s smart to avoid enabling bad choices. It\u2019s good to support your family, just not when they regard you as an ATM to make up for their repeated bad behavior.", "NTA. All the y-t-a commentators are jealous of you lol: not only your company but your success, and are self-inserting themselves into your story in the role of your sister, except with their personal spin on their tales of woe. \n\nYou have money, and you\u2019re being snarky to the \u201cdowntrodden\u201d: this sub is not gonna be a friendly place for you even tho you are in the right and your sister sounds lazy, entitled, and short-sighted.", "Man to man, that's your niece. You don't deserve the problems of a child that you didn't conceive, but thats your family and blood. Its not your nieces fault who her parents are. It's bigger than you.", "Give her nothing\u2026.nothing. Nta", "You are NTA but, my daughter is in high school and to participate in music programs at more than the most basic level, private lessons are pretty much required. I wouldn't give them cash but sponsoring the kid directly could make a huge difference. Even if she doesn't go on to a music career, it helps with university admissions.", "NTA. I see your comments why she didn\u2019t get a part of the business. You don\u2019t *owe* her or her kids anything. However, if you want to give voice lessons as a \u201cgift\u201d directly to your niece,  that would be awesome. No judgement, honestly, I just have a soft spot for kids with parents like this, they are not going to be supported. It could backfire in that your sister may continue to ask for things, but sounds like you know how to draw a line. Btw - I would not apologize, you don\u2019t owe anyone one.", "You\u2019re not TA for saying no per say, but YTA because you come across as a harsh, spoiled, judgemental snot. \n>\nIt would have been a super sweet gesture to your niece had you helped pay for lessons as an early birthday gift. There are so many talented kids who never get a real chance in life to shine, simply because there isn\u2019t money for extracurricular activities.", "OP may come across as harsh but NTA. Also the whole privilege chat is kind of moot here because the sister was afforded the same opportunities but chose not to take advantage of them. Another major thing is the fact that the sister is trying to manipulate OP by going through the wife but has too much shame to ask her parents? If the lessons were so significant I\u2019d think the grandparents would be more willing to help rather than OP who practically doesn\u2019t know these kids.", "NTA!  You\u2019re right, you are not her keeper or her father.  Eventually she needs to be ACCOUNTABLE for her actions.  Don\u2019t feel bad.", "I think YTA.\n\nYou don't have any strict obligation to hand over money, but you are incredibly judgemental about your sibling.\n\nIf all their misfortune is as a resuot of their choices, does that mean you think your inheritence is a result of yours?\n\nTo be honest, if you want to cut your family off just do it. But if you do care about their wellbeing then staying on the sidelines and passing judgement is just you cruelly satisfying your superiority complex.\n\nDo you want to support your innocent 10 year old neice or not? By the sounds of it they need all the help they can get if their parents are as you so compassionately describe them.", "I mean...YTA but you're also a representation of today's society. Once upon a time families would all help each other. If your sister was stupid, you'd still take care of her kids even if it were wants and not needs. But we don't currently live in that world. If people are struggling, even if their family can help, that is not who we turn to. Turn to the government. She'll have to see if she can get some kind of government aid to free up some funds if she wants to give her kids any luxuries. Yes in a perfect world she'd dump the loser, get a better job and meet a partner to help, but we don't. We live in a welfare state. So of course you won't help your family.", "The comment was harsh, but not entirely unwarranted. So you're not the whole asshole. \n\nDoes she receive any derivatives from the plant? If not did she get anything? If not, why? And why would she be embarrassed to ask her own parents, but not her SIL barely knows?", "YTA.\n\nNepo baby who owes everything he has to his family is, for some reason, above his family. I assume OP also believes his success is also solely due to his hard work.", "I'd go with ESH here.\n\nYour sister shouldn't feel entitled to your money but your comment was also a little rude. Yeah, technically speaking, your niece isn't your responsibility but she's just an innocent child. The only person who's going to suffer from this whole situation is her. She shouldn't get punished for her parents' mistakes. Since you are doing very well financially, you could definitely help your niece. (If I was you, I would never help your sister or her boyfriend, though. They need to get their shit together) \n\nAlso, tell your sister to dump her boyfriend.", "NTA. \n\nI'll probably get a lot of flack for this: Your sister has made the choices she has that impact her life and her daughters' life. \n\nShe asked, you said no. Then she started making comments that didn't need to be made, literally just to be rude. While your comments weren't nice, you spoke a truth that she doesn't want to hear or understand how it impacts her life. If her bf doesn't work, who pays for him to get high? I'd assume that would be her. That money could be going towards a vocal coach. \n\nMy take: I think you made the right choice, as hard as it is, since it still your niece, despite not being close. No one likes to think of kids missing out on things when they could easily make it happen. However- unless you are the one paying the vocal couch directly, you have no way of really knowing where the money would go. And unless you have a way to meet the person, you can't know for sure it's not some scam your sister is playing.", "YTA", "Some people here are missing this piece:\n\n>I declined politely until she made a comment about my money and cars, **just another \u201cmust be nice\u201d comment I\u2019m all too sick of hearing.**\n\nBolded is my emphasis.\n\nSo it's been years of making snide and passive aggressive comments by the sister. The same sister that is too ashamed, or too chicken, or - just maybe - has depleted the parents' money train because of her constant begging. Maybe she's made too many snippy comments to the parents, too, and they've finally had enough.\n\nNow, if she'd been nicer all these years, OP probably wouldn't hesitate to help out.\n\nOP took on the family business. OP has made it a continued success. OP made personal choices that resulted in having a comfortable life. \n\nNobody is obligated to help raise or fund their sibling(s) child(ren).\n\nSister seems to have a habit of making not so smart life choices. That is not OP's problem.\n\nCould OP have been be nicer? Less insulting? Sure. But even the most patient people finally have enough, and that's what this sounds like. \n\nNTA.", "Having read the responses you've made to some of the other posters, combined with the OP, I'm going to go with YTA. I'd like to clarify that this is because of your response to your sister, not whether or not you pay for singing lessons for your niece.\n\nYou're in a position nearly nobody ends up in and that is a massive, ludicrous advantage. You might have worked to get it, but plenty of people work harder than you and don't get that kind of opportunity. You have been handed a functioning, profitable business and have reaped the advantages of it. Your sister has not, whether that's by her choice or not. Frankly, making her wait most of her life to get the same benefits you have right now is deeply unfair to her regardless of her choices. Exactly what age was she when she made the choice not to work in this manufacturing plant anyway?\n\nBased on this context of unfairness, your comment that rather than help your sister and your blameless, talented niece you'd waste money on cars is a super asshole thing to say. You are the asshole for this, because you're rubbing it in her face that you've got the advantage and she doesn't and this is apparently all her fault for not wanting to work in a manufacturing plant and having a boyfriend who is lazy.\n\nYou come across as privileged and ignorant about that privilege. You don't owe your sister money, but it would be kind to help your niece out if you chose to. Your parents definitely do owe your sister, and the fact she's scared to ask them should tell you everything you need to know about her situation with them, and the likelihood of her ever getting anything from them. You're the favoured child and she's not, and you lording your wealth over her is a very asshole thing to do.", "ESH. You don\u2019t need to twist the knife into your sister and she shouldn\u2019t be demanding money. \n\nYou\u2019ve had good fortune from your inheritance. Personally, I would help your niece with voice lessons. It\u2019s a kind thing to do, but it\u2019s your money.", "Nta, she chose not to learn the business, chose to have a deadbeat boyfriend, chose to not ask her daughter\u2019s father for money.

And her bf could get off his ass and work, you owe her nothing", "YTA\n\nYour are 100% within your rights legally and morally to say no to paying for lessons. She isn\u2019t starving and asking for food- she\u2019s asking for voice lessons. Sucks for her daughter but she\u2019ll live.\n\nThe way you went about it is absolutely vile. You clearly have a lot of disdain and hatred for your sister. You immediately jumped down her throat and shamed her, mocking her, and for what? Made fun of her intelligence, mocked her divorce (??) Because she asked? Jesus dude. On top of all of that- you act like a God because daddy gave you a manufacturing plant. You aren\u2019t better than her- you were spoiled and gifted something the vast majority of people would never have the chance to have. You are a nepotism baby, plain and simple. No amount of \u201cchoices\u201d in life can allow the average person to be able to afford ten cars and whatever the hell else they want.", "NTA. Stay away. You\u2019re right.

Why wasn't the sister given a part of it?", "ESH.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP would you feel better to give the money directly to your niece?  If so here is an idea.  Have a conversation with your niece, explaining your feelings - you want her to be successful but you don't want to enable bad decisions by her mother.  And then pay for the class.  Your sister will likely disown you, but your niece will look up to you and appreciate what you have done.  Just an idea.", "NTA and once you get started giving her money, it might suddenly become an entitlement. She can swallow her pride and go to her parents or else kick out the useless bf and make some decisions with her life.

Don't let her emotionally manipulate you into submission.", "NTA\n\nYou sister didn't like when you told her no, and came with a smartass answer so you did the same.

Don\u2019t encourage the idea that your sister has a right to your money \u201cjust cause\u201d.\n\nYour sister is primarily TA though. Singing lessons are not a need, they are a luxury. Demanding a sibling give them money just cause they make or have more is unreasonable and very entitled. Your sister\u2019s situation is sad, but it is due to bad decisions. Your not responsible for her or her family, and should be very not to give money to support these decisions. She shouldn\u2019t be paying for boyfriend - her decision. I read your comment that she didn\u2019t get the plant because she chose to have nothing to do with it - her decision. She should be going after birth fathers for support - her decision not to. She needs to take responsibilities for her decisions. Giving money to her is very unhelpful to her.\n\nAgain, ESH only because of how you spoke to her.

It\u2019s something my wife and I agreed on early in our relationship. We both have pretty good jobs and are able to afford many expensive items and activities. I attribute this to our jobs obviously, but also the fact that we are child free and live in a one bedroom apartment. I own a manufacturing plant that was given to me from my father. On that property, I store 4 classic cars that I have bought/restored. I have always been a car guy. I plan to buy another car in the next year too. \n\nI have one sister who is younger than me and never made the best decisions in life. She has a boyfriend who she lives with after getting divorced twice. She\u2019s also in her early 40s. She has 2 kids who already seem smarter than their mom. She makes an okay living but she\u2019s the breadwinner. Her bf that she lives with spends most of his time stoned and playing Xbox. He\u2019s always \u201clooking for a new job\u201d. Or blaming \u201cthe capitalist system\u201d for him not having a job. \n\nHer daughter (10) is a very good singer. I don\u2019t have an ear for talent but to me She is very good. My sister has wanted to enroll her in lessons with a private coach but cannot afford it. She has asked me to help her out since she is embarrassed to ask our parents. She also does not speak to the father of her daughter. I declined politely until she made a comment about my money and cars, just another \u201cmust be nice\u201d comment I\u2019m all too sick of hearing.

She\u2019s got a mother and a father and if they can\u2019t figure it out it doesn\u2019t fall on my shoulders. \n\nMy sister called my wife and told her \u201chow mean\u201d I was to her. My wife now wants us to give the money, but I don\u2019t want to. Sure we can afford it but I\u2019m not my sisters welfare. Last bit, I\u2019m sure some of you will make a comment about how I refer to her daughter or my niece. They live in another state and have for the entirety of her life.

OP clarifies in another comment that she had the same option as him to join the business but instead chose to go to college to become a teacher and dropped out after 2 years to get married.

But he knew that doing so would set up better financially so he chose to do it anyways. He's still working for his paycheck. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Now everyone calls her a freeloader for some reason.\n\nI don't see anywhere in the post where she's referred to as a freeloader.", "This doesn't sound like an inheritance, as far as OP's post goes both parents are still alive. \n\nThis reads as though it was Dad wanted to retire, offered the business to the kids. OP took the opportunity, sister did not.\n\nIf my dad offered me a position at the family business, and I decided not to take it but my brother did, I don't get to be upset if he's bringing home a bigger paycheck than me. He's working for his money, it's not being handed to him and I was given the exact same opportunity. \n\nHow would it be fair to OP that he has to deal with the stress and responsibility of owning a factory to earn his income while his sister decided she didn't want to and still gets handed a bunch of cash?

Any money that is given to his sister would essentially be coming from his paycheck - which again, he's working for.", "In what way is OP entitled?", "Thank god I don't have people like you and OP as family.

The business is not an inheritance because Op didn\u2019t simply inherit the business. His dad gave him equity and a stake in ownership for him working there. You can become an owner without having started the company so it doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t personally believe he didn\u2019t put in millions of dollars of work, because that\u2019s not how equity is earned and not how ownership in a business always works. So any preconceived ideas you have about his sister being owed some value of this business doesn\u2019t apply because Op did not inherit this in the traditional inheritance sense. \n\n> and if it was given to him then the sister should get a better part of the remaining inheritance.\n\nOP was not \u201cgiven\u201d the business in the way you keep implying. and what remaining inheritance are you even talking about? The business was not being lumped into a large pot as part of a communal inheritance to be split up, their father gave equity and ownership to the person who dedicated their career to the business", "You're doubting OPs word that OPs sister was given a choice in whether or not to work at that company.\n\nThis is you doubting OPs word without a reason.\n\nAlso, I'm not being aggressive.", "I feel sorry for the kids.

I would be ok helping more if she was trying to get her and her kids into a better situation.\n\n\nAdd and edit: \n\nI don\u2019t own a manufacturing plant. But my husband and I have done very well for ourself. Do you know how many times we have purchased something and heard the words must be nice?

We don't know that OP wanted anything to do with manufacturing. He may have had different goals and aspirations, just like his sister. But ultimately, when the option was put on the table for both of them, he decided that the factory would ensure financial security for him and his wife, and chose that path. \n\nSo now, he's working at the factory dealing with the stress and responsibility of running that place. He made his choice, sister made hers.", "Sure, and the same opportunity was given to her. \n\nThis isn't a case of dad giving OP money from his savings account while leaving the sister out. The money is in the factory, OP's income is generated from the factory. He is working for his paycheck. If sister got any money, it'd essentially be coming from his paycheck. \n\nWhy on earth should he have to deal with the stress and responsibility of running a factory, while simultaneously giving his sister a chunk of his paycheck? In what world would that be far to make one kid work for money while handing the other kid money without needing to work for it?", "He's not an \"heir.\" They retired. They're still alive. \n\nAnd again, \"privilege\" is comparative. Right now we're talking about the relationship between brother and sister, both of whom had the same opportunity. OP stated that the parents offered the sister an opportunity to work for the company and that she was told that she wouldn't get anything from it if she didn't work for them. That's not unreasonable.", "That's fair. I'm thinking more in this vacuum of the situation. Since both had the same opportunities, neither is privileged over the other. The sister chose not to take opportunities and is acting like OP is privileged over her with her comments and such. In that case there is no privelage. Both had the same opportunities to start with. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom my own perspective, yes, he does have privelage, but I personally think that's getting a bit off topic. He's not being a dick to an employee. For all we know, if an employee asked for help, he'd be glad to. Or maybe he's a dick to employees. We don't know, and it's not relevant.

I know that OP worked at the factory all their life and because of that they were given the company. What you need to understand is that it was GIVEN to you, you did not buy it. If this was any other factory (without your father involved) you would not of simply worked your way to the top to be handed the business. You may have been on an accelerated career path as well, making more, faster than the average worker.  Many people have held jobs for 20 to 25 years and they aren't being showen how to take over and being handed everything. I also understand that your sister could have taken part in all this but declined. \n\nWhat you need to understand is that when you started working there at 21, she was in her early teens. By the time she would be old enough to work there, you had been there for years already. Joining you and your father on this may have felt like third wheeling, she may have been offered to join but did not feel welcome. Your sister probably felt like she needed to create her own path. I did see that you mentioned she went to college for some time but left upon meeting her husband. \n\nFrom what I have seen it is true that she has made bad choices and has not lived the greatest life but I can relate and I want to help others to understand. For me, my brother was bought a house. He had kids, had troubles with the law, and it was hard for them to maintain a proper living situation. So my sister bought him a house so the kids would have somewhere to grow up and when they were old enough she was going to sell it. At one point in my life I asked her to help me get a house, and I was denied. I have never been in trouble with the law, I had a good work record, took care of my kid. At the time I guess I was looking to get a headstart and put down roots. Since then I have doubled down on my independence, I do not ask anyone for help and secretly resent my siblings. \n\nI feel like in a way that is what is happening here. I did see that the parents helped out with the college but that does not compare at all to what you received. And yes I do understand that life is not fair, it seems that you were given quite a bit more and then judge your sister for not having very much. All of your comments in your post compare your life against hers like it is a contest. You have this and this, NO KIDS, and she lives like this and has kids, pssshhht. \n\nAnother thing I need to point out is something I tell my son. He has a half brother who he complains about their behavior sometimes. What I tell him, is not to judge him too harshly, it is not his fault, kids are a product of their parents. If they were raised to act like such and such behavior is ok, and they are allowed to continue it, then they will. You may need to think back to your childhood and your sisters. Being 6-8 years apart can end up having siblings being raised differently. They may have been stricker on you with what you were given while being lenient with her. It may have turned her into being entied and resentful.\n\nRegardless, this is when you need to decide how you want the rest of your relationship with your sister/her kids to be. While I do not think she should be given handouts (unless she is in dire need) I do think you need to be more appreciative of what you have, be humble about it and really look back at how you talk about her in this post. If you want a relationship with them, then just talk with her (in a kind and caring mannor). See why she is in this positon, with the boyfriend, the exs, the finanical.

Depending on how feasible that is, the answer may still be \"no\" but that's how you take proper steps to attempt to rectify that regret in a productive way.", "If that is available in this girl's area, sure, that is most definitely an option.", "The chances of anyone being able to get into a university-level music program without years of private instruction are disturbingly close to zero, and the chances of someone getting a music career going after putting that off until they're adults and scrimping to pay for their own lessons and then going back to school later are ACTUALLY zero. At age 22 I was told, point blank, I was \"too old\" to study violin at university by a Julliard-educated professor at my local university, at the same time that another university's conducting professor told me \"all of my students who get their master's degree before the age of 30 found (mostly bad) jobs, none of my students who graduated in their 30s have gotten jobs.\" There are alternative pathways into musical careers, but usually those are in hip hop, dance, rock etc. and even then, it's HARD without extensive training and good networking skills. Youtube videos and school choirs are for people to learn some nice skills and have fun appreciating music, private lessons are for people actually trying to do this as a career, and there's not half as much wiggle room as these comments suggest.", "My brother has 5 kids. I\u2019ve only met them a time or two. They live 2000 miles away. All five are smarter than him, at least in a manner of speaking. Three are in college on scholarships. Their mom and dad both dropped out of HS and their dad (my brother) is probably facing prison this time around.", "Does Communism actually allow people to not work or barely work while other people who do work are financially supporting them? I'm not really sure if I understand, but I thought Communism means everyone in the commune has to work equally as hard in order to partake in what everyone has made.", "Also, idk if this is what OP did, but my sister and her husband are currently buying his dad's business in a payment plan. So they're currently part-owners while managing the business, working their way to full ownership.", "Further, people who aren't interested in the business having a stake in it can actually damage a business' long term prospects.", "Excellent point there. Like, how does the dope-smoker gamer boyfriend think he would fare if he actually *had* to work?", "People who support communism think it means that, yes.", "Heck, sometimes you do things you hate for the benefit of yourself. Most people aren't working a job they love and even when they are, it's still not going to be 100% enjoyable all the time. That's life. You do what you have to so you can do (some of) what you want to.", "I mean, he doesn't call his niece his niece, but instead his \"sister's daughter\". What has the niece done wrong? He mentions nothing about her other than that he doesn't see her, and based on the way he talks he doesn't seem to care or want to.\n\nHow is not paying for voice lessons for his niece a punishment for his sister? This is some straight \"sins of the father\" type deal. He could absolutely do it for his niece if he wanted to, not his sister.", "He literally says \"her daughter\" as in his sister's daughter, for continuity. He also said she's a good singer and despite not having an ear for talent, still thinks this, so it's clear he recognizes her achievements. That doesn't mean he needs to fund them.", "> Last bit, I\u2019m sure some of you will make a comment about how I refer to her daughter or my niece. They live in another state and have for the entirety of her life. I don\u2019t see my sister or her kids much at all. I don\u2019t really know her kids too well. I send them birthday and Christmas gifts but I\u2019m not close with them.\n\nAnd I'm not saying he NEEDS to do anything. It would just be nice is all, and the way he talks about it rubs me the wrong way."]}
