It\u2019s something my wife and I agreed on early in our relationship. We both have pretty good jobs and are able to afford many expensive items and activities. I attribute this to our jobs obviously, but also the fact that we are child free and live in a one bedroom apartment. I own a manufacturing plant that was given to me from my father. On that property, I store 4 classic cars that I have bought/restored. I have always been a car guy. I plan to buy another car in the next year too. \n\nI have one sister who is younger than me and never made the best decisions in life. She has a boyfriend who she lives with after getting divorced twice. She\u2019s also in her early 40s. She has 2 kids who already seem smarter than their mom. She makes an okay living but she\u2019s the breadwinner. Her bf that she lives with spends most of his time stoned and playing Xbox. He\u2019s always \u201clooking for a new job\u201d. Or blaming \u201cthe capitalist system\u201d for him not having a job. \n\nHer daughter (10) is a very good singer. I don\u2019t have an ear for talent but to me She is very good. My sister has wanted to enroll her in lessons with a private coach but cannot afford it. She has asked me to help her out since she is embarrassed to ask our parents. She also does not speak to the father of her daughter. I declined politely until she made a comment about my money and cars, just another \u201cmust be nice\u201d comment I\u2019m all too sick of hearing. Here is where I made my asshole comment. \n\nI said \u201cMaybe if your boyfriend can put down the dope for all of 10 minutes he can help you out\u201d and \u201cI have 5 cars I\u2019ll buy another 5 before I give you a dime\u201d. I said her daughter isn\u2019t my responsibility. She\u2019s got a mother and a father and if they can\u2019t figure it out it doesn\u2019t fall on my shoulders. \n\nMy sister called my wife and told her \u201chow mean\u201d I was to her. My wife now wants us to give the money, but I don\u2019t want to. Sure we can afford it but I\u2019m not my sisters welfare. Last bit, I\u2019m sure some of you will make a comment about how I refer to her daughter or my niece. They live in another state and have for the entirety of her life. I don\u2019t see my sister or her kids much at all. I don\u2019t really know her kids too well. I send them birthday and Christmas gifts but I\u2019m not close with them.\n\nEdit: this is coming up a lot in comments. My sister could have had a stake in the business but she didn\u2019t want to work there. I\u2019ve worked for my dad all my life and learned the business. She never did. She knew she wouldn\u2019t be getting anything with it and she was okay with that.", "created_utc": 1678115896, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11k1le8/aita_for_what_i_said_to_my_sister_after_she/", "score": 441, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are of course not at all obligated, but if your niece would enjoy it, consider setting up the lessons yourself and paying the teacher/school directly.

She made her decision and has to accept the consequences. And you were a bit harsh but perhaps someone needs to be since she chooses deadbeat men over providing for her children.

It\u2019s not even something she needs (like fukin food or a little rent one month) it\u2019s dance lessons??! Her daughter can have a friend over and watch an instructor on YouTube for free. Or the mom can save a few months to begin putting her in classes.", "NTA, she made her bed and has other options she just doesn\u2019t want to try before hounding you for money, but I gotta ask, what are the cars? I\u2019m also a car guy lol.", "YTA for what you said, not that you didn't want to give your sister money.  You can say 'No' with being an AH about it.  Yes, people make different life choices and have consequences as a result, but acting superior to your sister was definitely an AH move.", "NTA, and tell your wife that this is a dealbreaker and not up for further discussion. Sometimes you have to give a hard no, and this is clearly one of those times.", "YTA for saying what you said.  You don't get to make judgments on her decisions, just like she doesn't get to make judgments on yours.  If her \"must be nice\" comments bother you, you can always tell her you don't appreciate her trying to make you feel guilty for success.  It is not  a license for you to tell her all the things you think she's doing wrong.  Keep that shit to yourself.\n\nHowever, you are NTA for refusing.  \"No.\" is a complete sentence.", "NTA, for a few reasons.  You\u2019re not all that close, for starters.  I may be assuming a bit, but she seems to have a poor track record with picking men and it costs her financially.  You pointing out that her boyfriend is a bum is ugly, but it is also a fact.  There\u2019s a small chance that what you said will get through to her and she might make some changes.  \n\nWhat kind of weighs on my mind is the niece.  While I realize that you\u2019re not responsible for her, I think about the influences she has at home.  Your sister might be an ok mom, but what the niece sees is that clinging on to a mediocre man and letting him sponge off you is ok.  That the boyfriend shows her it\u2019s ok to be a lazy slob.  If I could afford to give her an opportunity to succeed, I would, in the hopes it would guide her to making better choices.  I\u2019d for sure pay it directly to the coach or facility though.", "NTA. If you wanted to make it a gift for maybe a holiday or a birthday, then sure, go for it. But it\u2019s smart to avoid enabling bad choices. It\u2019s good to support your family, just not when they regard you as an ATM to make up for their repeated bad behavior.", "NTA. All the y-t-a commentators are jealous of you lol: not only your company but your success, and are self-inserting themselves into your story in the role of your sister, except with their personal spin on their tales of woe. \n\nYou have money, and you\u2019re being snarky to the \u201cdowntrodden\u201d: this sub is not gonna be a friendly place for you even tho you are in the right and your sister sounds lazy, entitled, and short-sighted.", "Man to man, that's your niece. You don't deserve the problems of a child that you didn't conceive, but thats your family and blood. Its not your nieces fault who her parents are. It's bigger than you.", "Give her nothing\u2026.nothing. Nta", "You are NTA but, my daughter is in high school and to participate in music programs at more than the most basic level, private lessons are pretty much required. I wouldn't give them cash but sponsoring the kid directly could make a huge difference. Even if she doesn't go on to a music career, it helps with university admissions.", "NTA. I see your comments why she didn\u2019t get a part of the business. You don\u2019t *owe* her or her kids anything. However, if you want to give voice lessons as a \u201cgift\u201d directly to your niece,  that would be awesome. No judgement, honestly, I just have a soft spot for kids with parents like this, they are not going to be supported. It could backfire in that your sister may continue to ask for things, but sounds like you know how to draw a line. Btw - I would not apologize, you don\u2019t owe anyone one.", "You\u2019re not TA for saying no per say, but YTA because you come across as a harsh, spoiled, judgemental snot. \n>\nIt would have been a super sweet gesture to your niece had you helped pay for lessons as an early birthday gift. There are so many talented kids who never get a real chance in life to shine, simply because there isn\u2019t money for extracurricular activities.", "OP may come across as harsh but NTA. Also the whole privilege chat is kind of moot here because the sister was afforded the same opportunities but chose not to take advantage of them. Another major thing is the fact that the sister is trying to manipulate OP by going through the wife but has too much shame to ask her parents? If the lessons were so significant I\u2019d think the grandparents would be more willing to help rather than OP who practically doesn\u2019t know these kids.", "NTA!  You\u2019re right, you are not her keeper or her father.  Eventually she needs to be ACCOUNTABLE for her actions.  Don\u2019t feel bad.", "I think YTA.\n\nYou don't have any strict obligation to hand over money, but you are incredibly judgemental about your sibling.\n\nIf all their misfortune is as a resuot of their choices, does that mean you think your inheritence is a result of yours?\n\nTo be honest, if you want to cut your family off just do it. But if you do care about their wellbeing then staying on the sidelines and passing judgement is just you cruelly satisfying your superiority complex.\n\nDo you want to support your innocent 10 year old neice or not? By the sounds of it they need all the help they can get if their parents are as you so compassionately describe them.", "I mean...YTA but you're also a representation of today's society. Once upon a time families would all help each other. If your sister was stupid, you'd still take care of her kids even if it were wants and not needs. But we don't currently live in that world. If people are struggling, even if their family can help, that is not who we turn to. Turn to the government. She'll have to see if she can get some kind of government aid to free up some funds if she wants to give her kids any luxuries. Yes in a perfect world she'd dump the loser, get a better job and meet a partner to help, but we don't. We live in a welfare state. So of course you won't help your family.", "The comment was harsh, but not entirely unwarranted. So you're not the whole asshole. \n\nDoes she receive any derivatives from the plant? If not did she get anything? If not, why? And why would she be embarrassed to ask her own parents, but not her SIL barely knows?", "YTA.\n\nNepo baby who owes everything he has to his family is, for some reason, above his family. I assume OP also believes his success is also solely due to his hard work.", "I'd go with ESH here.\n\nYour sister shouldn't feel entitled to your money but your comment was also a little rude. Yeah, technically speaking, your niece isn't your responsibility but she's just an innocent child. The only person who's going to suffer from this whole situation is her. She shouldn't get punished for her parents' mistakes. Since you are doing very well financially, you could definitely help your niece. (If I was you, I would never help your sister or her boyfriend, though. They need to get their shit together) \n\nAlso, tell your sister to dump her boyfriend.", "NTA. \n\nI'll probably get a lot of flack for this: Your sister has made the choices she has that impact her life and her daughters' life. \n\nShe asked, you said no. Then she started making comments that didn't need to be made, literally just to be rude. While your comments weren't nice, you spoke a truth that she doesn't want to hear or understand how it impacts her life. If her bf doesn't work, who pays for him to get high? I'd assume that would be her. That money could be going towards a vocal coach. \n\nMy take: I think you made the right choice, as hard as it is, since it still your niece, despite not being close. No one likes to think of kids missing out on things when they could easily make it happen. However- unless you are the one paying the vocal couch directly, you have no way of really knowing where the money would go. And unless you have a way to meet the person, you can't know for sure it's not some scam your sister is playing.", "YTA", "Some people here are missing this piece:\n\n>I declined politely until she made a comment about my money and cars, **just another \u201cmust be nice\u201d comment I\u2019m all too sick of hearing.**\n\nBolded is my emphasis.\n\nSo it's been years of making snide and passive aggressive comments by the sister. The same sister that is too ashamed, or too chicken, or - just maybe - has depleted the parents' money train because of her constant begging. Maybe she's made too many snippy comments to the parents, too, and they've finally had enough.\n\nNow, if she'd been nicer all these years, OP probably wouldn't hesitate to help out.\n\nOP took on the family business. OP has made it a continued success. OP made personal choices that resulted in having a comfortable life. \n\nNobody is obligated to help raise or fund their sibling(s) child(ren).\n\nSister seems to have a habit of making not so smart life choices. That is not OP's problem.\n\nCould OP have been be nicer? Less insulting? Sure. But even the most patient people finally have enough, and that's what this sounds like. \n\nNTA.", "Having read the responses you've made to some of the other posters, combined with the OP, I'm going to go with YTA. I'd like to clarify that this is because of your response to your sister, not whether or not you pay for singing lessons for your niece.\n\nYou're in a position nearly nobody ends up in and that is a massive, ludicrous advantage. You might have worked to get it, but plenty of people work harder than you and don't get that kind of opportunity. You have been handed a functioning, profitable business and have reaped the advantages of it. Your sister has not, whether that's by her choice or not. Frankly, making her wait most of her life to get the same benefits you have right now is deeply unfair to her regardless of her choices. Exactly what age was she when she made the choice not to work in this manufacturing plant anyway?\n\nBased on this context of unfairness, your comment that rather than help your sister and your blameless, talented niece you'd waste money on cars is a super asshole thing to say. You are the asshole for this, because you're rubbing it in her face that you've got the advantage and she doesn't and this is apparently all her fault for not wanting to work in a manufacturing plant and having a boyfriend who is lazy.\n\nYou come across as privileged and ignorant about that privilege. You don't owe your sister money, but it would be kind to help your niece out if you chose to. Your parents definitely do owe your sister, and the fact she's scared to ask them should tell you everything you need to know about her situation with them, and the likelihood of her ever getting anything from them. You're the favoured child and she's not, and you lording your wealth over her is a very asshole thing to do.", "ESH. You don\u2019t need to twist the knife into your sister and she shouldn\u2019t be demanding money. \n\nYou\u2019ve had good fortune from your inheritance. Personally, I would help your niece with voice lessons. It\u2019s a kind thing to do, but it\u2019s your money.", "Nta, she chose not to learn the business, chose to have a deadbeat boyfriend, chose to not ask her daughter\u2019s father for money. I don\u2019t see why you need to help her", "NTA like you said she could have a stake in the company but refused to. And her bf could get off his ass and work, you owe her nothing", "YTA\n\nYour are 100% within your rights legally and morally to say no to paying for lessons. She isn\u2019t starving and asking for food- she\u2019s asking for voice lessons. Sucks for her daughter but she\u2019ll live.\n\nThe way you went about it is absolutely vile. You clearly have a lot of disdain and hatred for your sister. You immediately jumped down her throat and shamed her, mocking her, and for what? Made fun of her intelligence, mocked her divorce (??) Because she asked? Jesus dude. On top of all of that- you act like a God because daddy gave you a manufacturing plant. You aren\u2019t better than her- you were spoiled and gifted something the vast majority of people would never have the chance to have. You are a nepotism baby, plain and simple. No amount of \u201cchoices\u201d in life can allow the average person to be able to afford ten cars and whatever the hell else they want.", "NTA. Stay away. You\u2019re right.

Why wasn't the sister given a part of it?", "ESH.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP would you feel better to give the money directly to your niece?  If so here is an idea.  Have a conversation with your niece, explaining your feelings - you want her to be successful but you don't want to enable bad decisions by her mother.  And then pay for the class.  Your sister will likely disown you, but your niece will look up to you and appreciate what you have done.  Just an idea.", "NTA and once you get started giving her money, it might suddenly become an entitlement. She can swallow her pride and go to her parents or else kick out the useless bf and make some decisions with her life.

Don't let her emotionally manipulate you into submission.", "NTA\n\nYou sister didn't like when you told her no, and came with a smartass answer so you did the same.

Your sister is by no means entitled to your money just because she is family and you earn more. You are responsible with your money it seems, good for you and your wife.

Don\u2019t encourage the idea that your sister has a right to your money \u201cjust cause\u201d.\n\nYour sister is primarily TA though. Singing lessons are not a need, they are a luxury. Demanding a sibling give them money just cause they make or have more is unreasonable and very entitled. Your sister\u2019s situation is sad, but it is due to bad decisions. Your not responsible for her or her family, and should be very not to give money to support these decisions. She shouldn\u2019t be paying for boyfriend - her decision. I read your comment that she didn\u2019t get the plant because she chose to have nothing to do with it - her decision. She should be going after birth fathers for support - her decision not to. She needs to take responsibilities for her decisions. Giving money to her is very unhelpful to her.\n\nAgain, ESH only because of how you spoke to her.

It\u2019s something my wife and I agreed on early in our relationship. We both have pretty good jobs and are able to afford many expensive items and activities. I attribute this to our jobs obviously, but also the fact that we are child free and live in a one bedroom apartment. I own a manufacturing plant that was given to me from my father. On that property, I store 4 classic cars that I have bought/restored. I have always been a car guy. I plan to buy another car in the next year too. \n\nI have one sister who is younger than me and never made the best decisions in life. She has a boyfriend who she lives with after getting divorced twice. She\u2019s also in her early 40s. She has 2 kids who already seem smarter than their mom. She makes an okay living but she\u2019s the breadwinner. Her bf that she lives with spends most of his time stoned and playing Xbox. He\u2019s always \u201clooking for a new job\u201d. Or blaming \u201cthe capitalist system\u201d for him not having a job. \n\nHer daughter (10) is a very good singer. I don\u2019t have an ear for talent but to me She is very good. My sister has wanted to enroll her in lessons with a private coach but cannot afford it. She has asked me to help her out since she is embarrassed to ask our parents. She also does not speak to the father of her daughter. I declined politely until she made a comment about my money and cars, just another \u201cmust be nice\u201d comment I\u2019m all too sick of hearing.

She\u2019s got a mother and a father and if they can\u2019t figure it out it doesn\u2019t fall on my shoulders. \n\nMy sister called my wife and told her \u201chow mean\u201d I was to her. My wife now wants us to give the money, but I don\u2019t want to. Sure we can afford it but I\u2019m not my sisters welfare. Last bit, I\u2019m sure some of you will make a comment about how I refer to her daughter or my niece. They live in another state and have for the entirety of her life.

OP clarifies in another comment that she had the same option as him to join the business but instead chose to go to college to become a teacher and dropped out after 2 years to get married.

Total AH", "What do you think the chances are that OP has been condescending and rude to his sister in the past without a good reason? Feels close to 100% to me.", "You said she should get something in similar monetary value. In addition, your question about an early inheritance is irrelevant to judging the situation.", ">She chose to earn her own money doing something she presumably likes better than manufacturing under Daddy's control.\n\nThat's fine, but don't expect to earn the same paycheck? I'm in marketing and hated working for corporate so when I had two job offers, one at a big agency and one at a smaller company, I took the job at the smaller company knowing I'd be happier. I'm getting paid quite a bit less than what was offered at the big agency. But I was given the opportunity to make more, so I don't get to complain that I'm not making that paycheck. I made a choice.\n\nOP made his own choice. Maybe he'd like to do something better than manufacturing under Daddy's control as well. But he knew that doing so would set up better financially so he chose to do it anyways. He's still working for his paycheck. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Now everyone calls her a freeloader for some reason.\n\nI don't see anywhere in the post where she's referred to as a freeloader.", "This doesn't sound like an inheritance, as far as OP's post goes both parents are still alive. \n\nThis reads as though it was Dad wanted to retire, offered the business to the kids. OP took the opportunity, sister did not.\n\nIf my dad offered me a position at the family business, and I decided not to take it but my brother did, I don't get to be upset if he's bringing home a bigger paycheck than me. He's working for his money, it's not being handed to him and I was given the exact same opportunity. \n\nHow would it be fair to OP that he has to deal with the stress and responsibility of owning a factory to earn his income while his sister decided she didn't want to and still gets handed a bunch of cash? The money is in the factory, it's not like OP's father is giving him money from his savings account. Any money that is given to his sister would essentially be coming from his paycheck - which again, he's working for.", "In what way is OP entitled?", "Thank god I don't have people like you and OP as family. Will punish a 10 year old who is your niece to send some weird message to your own sister. Thats family bro. One day he is not going to have a kid of his own to care for him, hopefully his cars he is buying come with elder care too.", ">remaining inheritance\n\nThe business is not an inheritance to begin with...", "> I get that but im talking about the remaining inheritance. even it op worked for it im sure he didnt do several million dollars worth of work. \n\nI think this is flying over your head. The business is not an inheritance because Op didn\u2019t simply inherit the business. His dad gave him equity and a stake in ownership for him working there. You can become an owner without having started the company so it doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t personally believe he didn\u2019t put in millions of dollars of work, because that\u2019s not how equity is earned and not how ownership in a business always works. So any preconceived ideas you have about his sister being owed some value of this business doesn\u2019t apply because Op did not inherit this in the traditional inheritance sense. \n\n> and if it was given to him then the sister should get a better part of the remaining inheritance.\n\nOP was not \u201cgiven\u201d the business in the way you keep implying. and what remaining inheritance are you even talking about? The business was not being lumped into a large pot as part of a communal inheritance to be split up, their father gave equity and ownership to the person who dedicated their career to the business", "You're doubting OPs word that OPs sister was given a choice in whether or not to work at that company.\n\nThis is you doubting OPs word without a reason.\n\nAlso, I'm not being aggressive.", "I feel sorry for the kids. But op\u2019s sister has had the same opportunity he did. She choose not to go that route. But now expects him to pay for big expenses.\n\n\nAnd I would feel different if she wasn\u2019t letting her bf free load off of her and the kids. I would be ok helping more if she was trying to get her and her kids into a better situation.\n\n\nAdd and edit: \n\nI don\u2019t own a manufacturing plant. But my husband and I have done very well for ourself. Do you know how many times we have purchased something and heard the words must be nice? Or how many times family has expected us to give them money because we can afford it. Yes we can afford it but only because we have worked out asses off the last 30 years.", "Yes but their opportunities were equal. Whether OP is privileged relative to you, me, or anybody except his sister is not relevant to whether he is an AH in this situation.", "I disagree with this. We don't know that OP wanted anything to do with manufacturing. He may have had different goals and aspirations, just like his sister. But ultimately, when the option was put on the table for both of them, he decided that the factory would ensure financial security for him and his wife, and chose that path. \n\nSo now, he's working at the factory dealing with the stress and responsibility of running that place. He made his choice, sister made hers.", "Sure, and the same opportunity was given to her. \n\nThis isn't a case of dad giving OP money from his savings account while leaving the sister out. The money is in the factory, OP's income is generated from the factory. He is working for his paycheck. If sister got any money, it'd essentially be coming from his paycheck. \n\nWhy on earth should he have to deal with the stress and responsibility of running a factory, while simultaneously giving his sister a chunk of his paycheck? In what world would that be far to make one kid work for money while handing the other kid money without needing to work for it?", "He's not an \"heir.\" They retired. They're still alive. \n\nAnd again, \"privilege\" is comparative. Right now we're talking about the relationship between brother and sister, both of whom had the same opportunity. OP stated that the parents offered the sister an opportunity to work for the company and that she was told that she wouldn't get anything from it if she didn't work for them. That's not unreasonable.", "That's fair. I'm thinking more in this vacuum of the situation. Since both had the same opportunities, neither is privileged over the other. The sister chose not to take opportunities and is acting like OP is privileged over her with her comments and such. In that case there is no privelage. Both had the same opportunities to start with. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom my own perspective, yes, he does have privelage, but I personally think that's getting a bit off topic. He's not being a dick to an employee. For all we know, if an employee asked for help, he'd be glad to. Or maybe he's a dick to employees. We don't know, and it's not relevant. He's asking when it pertains to his sister, someone who had equal opportunity to him, and he's nta for her bad choices", "I do a lot to help others.", ">He just doesn\u2019t seem to acknowledge the enormous leg up he has received in life. \n\nAnd what relevance does this have to judging whether or not he's the asshole for choosing to not subsizide his sisters life?", "It's not a leg up when he put in the work and she didn't. Equal opportunity does not mean equal outcome. She had the same opportunity he did. She chose not to take advantage of that opportunity. There are consequences to choices we make in life.", "He EARNED the leg up. Sister didn't want it and so didn't get it.", "But what does this have to do with the subject at hand? She's not disinherited, and even if she was, that's not OP's circus or monkeys. He made his choices, she made hers, their parents made theirs. Does she have a right to demand money from him? I say no- this is between her and her parents.", "100% this.\n\nMy sister is a dentist - my dad isn't giving her his dental practice and then giving me nothing! He & my mother have amended their will to keep things fair. They'll likely review this again in a few years because with property prices, I could end up with more than my sister which we don't want. But even if they didn't...sister and I would work it out. We get half each, we know this.", "Well, you said she was offered a share, but chose not to take it. Did you think that was unfair to you? She chose not to take it, I presume out of a sense of fairness to you. It sounds as though she can't win. If she'd taken the share without ever working at the firm, you'd be mad. She gave it all to you. But now you complain that it was a 'bad decision' financially on her part and begrudge her a few singing lessons. Poor woman is never going to do anything right by you or your parents. Hope she cuts you all loose.", "You got what you have by working for your father and being handed a portion of what he built.

They may be holding \"her half\" just waiting for her to dump the druggie BF.

IP just comes across as the AH due to his arrogance and his lack of humility in understanding the roots of his success are his dad, not his hard work.
