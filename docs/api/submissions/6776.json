My husband Bill (M50) and I (F51) greeted and caught up with Nicole's friends for a bit. One of Nicole's best guy friends John (M20) had started bulking up nearly a year ago according to Nicole, and it was definitely evident today. Bill complimented John and said he looked big, and I added to it, saying it was clear he was putting in the hard work. John thanked us, and Nicole said, \"Yeah dude, your ass is huge now, the squats and RDLs are definitely doin' you favors!\" John laughed and thanked Nicole, and Bill and I gave each other an awkward yet amused look. I wish I was making this up. \n\nThis morning, I was chatting with Nicole during breakfast, and John came up. Wanting to be honest, I told Nicole that I felt her relationship and dynamic with John was kind of weird, as it usually isn't normal for girls to be saying that about guys unless it's their significant other. I also told Nicole that I've never been that flirty with platonic guy friends I've had since I was a teenager. Only ever Bill. Nicole rolled her eyes and said I was \"stuck in the 1980s,\" and that her dynamic with John is just like that, playful and goofy. I asked if the two were dating, and I even assured Nicole that I'd be more than supportive if that were the case. Nicole got more annoyed and said no, saying that she's allowed to have platonic guy and girl friends that she can maintain her own dynamic with. She got up after that and went out to go see a friend, and I later talked to Bill. Bill agrees that the dynamic's a bit weird, but it's not up to us to just say that to our daughter. Since Nicole got home, we pretty much dropped the topic and are fine, but this hasn't left my mind.

It is in part understandable that you were weirded out if you were raised very differently, as seems to be the case, but your main issue comes in how you approached your daughter about this. Your questions and interactions with her overall suggest criticism of how she conducts her friendship rather than any actual curiosity of it.

Maybe not AH, but def prudish/conservative to the point of being out of touch.", "YTA\n\nYou're 50.  You don't understand the rapport that 20 year olds have with each other and you're not in a place to dictate it.  \n\nMove on with your life.  It's unimportant.", "Yeah YTA, there's nothing wrong with their dynamic.", "You're not an asshole but you've GOTTA lighten up. It honestly sounds like at least one of them may not be straight so they feel extra comfortable having a relationship that way. Not assuming, just saying that could be a possibility to consider. But also DONT ASK YOUR DAUGHTER ABOUT THAT EITHER or you'd be a huge asshole.", "I am 58 and I dont get it. When I was 22, I had plenty of platonic friends, and even co-workers, that talked shit with me. 80's were not that long ago, and things were not all that different. Parents here are not AH, just a little silly and old fashioned (in a 50's kind of way, and not 80's)", "in front of your parents?? Talking about his ass and about how good he looks should be between friends", "Girl, YES!!!! Came here to say this! Ppl who've put in the work KNOW how hard it is & appreciate other's hard work (like a well-developed booty). When I look at developed, or developing, muscles... I think: \"hell yeah! They put in the WORK!\" It's not sexual at all.", "Yes but who talks like that in front of their parents? Parents can try to be your friends but they are still supposed to be the \u201cwatch your language\u201d police. you should keep that shit to your outings with your friends", "Geezus people, parents are not your friends. Have some respect and keep the playful ogling to time with friends", "I had to scroll too far to see this. Out of touch or not understanding/comprehending, yes. An A-HOLE? No...", "yeah i straight up read daughters comment as humour trying to gloss over/cover/jog straight passed her parents commenting on her friends body", "She didn\u2019t say it looked good, she said it was huge. And yeah, I absolutely would\u2019ve said that in front of my mom. \n\nIf John were a girl OP wouldn\u2019t have batted an eye but because they\u2019re opposite sex friends there\u2019s all kinds of weird hang ups going on.", "Bot", "YTA.\n\nWell maybe not a AH, but definitely pushing your own ideas of behaviour onto your daughter.", "Really soft yta. The dynamic of interaction between the sexes hasn't changed much.  Some are always more free with their expressions and others struggle with their openness. Your daughter knows herself and her friends and the level they are comfortable  engaging with each other.", "YTA, this is normal friend banter.", "Yeah very soft YTA, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not trying to offend Nicole at all but take into account generational divides. I\u2019m a 25 year old female and this kind of thing is absolutely something I\u2019d say to my platonic guy friends.", "What century are you from? I'm your age and it's not weird or not the norm. In fact, this is like my whole life norm. If you have a friend who works out regardless of gender and you compliment them and encourage them, it's not weird. Are you Amish per chance? YTA\n\nSorry, no offense to Amish ppl. But seriously... where were you raised and by whom? You give Gen Xers a Boomer title (no offense to Boomers- I'm sure they're even more chill about this than you are). \n\nYou CAN be friends w/the opposite gender. You CAN admire someone's regimen without wanting to do them... This seems to be a YOU issue.", "Soft YTA.  Doesn\u2019t sound like you did anything bad, just don\u2019t understand how the younger generation act.   And to be honest..it\u2019s not even the younger generation.   Just drop it, and accept it.   If you keep going on about this, you may become a hard YTA", "When people ask questions like this I find myself wondering if they ever actually spend time with, like, other people? YTA, and I'm 59. And anyone who thinks a conversation like the one your daughter had with her friend would have been unusual in the 80s really has no idea what the 80s were like! \ud83d\ude02", "YTA. While I personally wouldn\u2019t be talking about someone\u2019s ass, I wouldn\u2019t bat an eye at my friends doing it with each other. I find it more odd that your husband complimented John on being big, but that might just be me.", "YTA cuz you\u2019re stuck in the 80s. Why\u2019s it matter what their friendship is like?", "YTA. They are happy with each other's comments which is all that really matters. I really don't see any harm in what she said. We all could do with some more compliments on how good we look.", "Your not the asshole, and let's be honest one of them wants to date or have sex with the other one. Sorry but it's true normal guys don't have friends that are girls that they just do stuff with unless they want to get with them. Argue all you want but that is the truth", "YTA", "YTA Not your business to comment on other adult relationships.", "YTA - Let her joke around with friends.", "Adding: if those are the types of comments John appreciates, then really, Nicole is just being a good friend and celebrating the progress John has made.", "Just watched Back To The Future (for the 200th time) last night! She sounds just like 80s Loraine whose mind was stuck in the feckless moralizing of her 50s youth)", "Right? Op should watch Mr/Miss Olympia commentary", "Lol, nah, this kind of banter was perfectly common between friends in the 80s. OP sounds like she was old-fashioned during the 80s.", "I got Little Red Riding Hood vibes. \u2018My, John, what big muscles you have!\u2019", "> Parents can try to be your friends but they are still supposed to be the \u201cwatch your language\u201d police. you should keep that shit to your outings with your friends\n\n\nI once heard you are truly an adult the day you stop seeing your parents as god-like authorities and instead realize they are actually people just like you;\n\n\nOn the other hand I've heard that you know you did a good job parenting when your kid stops being your kid and becomes your most cherished friend", "Nah, I learned all my best swearing from my parents. My mother in law added on some flair though.", "I respect and admire my mom and we've been cussing and making bawdy jokes around eachother since I was like, thirteen. Popping out a kid sometime in your life doesn't automatically turn you into a square who clutches their pearls over a dumb butt joke."]}
