My husband Bill (M50) and I (F51) greeted and caught up with Nicole's friends for a bit. One of Nicole's best guy friends John (M20) had started bulking up nearly a year ago according to Nicole, and it was definitely evident today. Bill complimented John and said he looked big, and I added to it, saying it was clear he was putting in the hard work. John thanked us, and Nicole said, \"Yeah dude, your ass is huge now, the squats and RDLs are definitely doin' you favors!\" John laughed and thanked Nicole, and Bill and I gave each other an awkward yet amused look. I wish I was making this up. \n\nThis morning, I was chatting with Nicole during breakfast, and John came up. Wanting to be honest, I told Nicole that I felt her relationship and dynamic with John was kind of weird, as it usually isn't normal for girls to be saying that about guys unless it's their significant other. I also told Nicole that I've never been that flirty with platonic guy friends I've had since I was a teenager. Only ever Bill. Nicole rolled her eyes and said I was \"stuck in the 1980s,\" and that her dynamic with John is just like that, playful and goofy. I asked if the two were dating, and I even assured Nicole that I'd be more than supportive if that were the case. Nicole got more annoyed and said no, saying that she's allowed to have platonic guy and girl friends that she can maintain her own dynamic with. She got up after that and went out to go see a friend, and I later talked to Bill. Bill agrees that the dynamic's a bit weird, but it's not up to us to just say that to our daughter. Since Nicole got home, we pretty much dropped the topic and are fine, but this hasn't left my mind.

It is in part understandable that you were weirded out if you were raised very differently, as seems to be the case, but your main issue comes in how you approached your daughter about this. Your questions and interactions with her overall suggest criticism of how she conducts her friendship rather than any actual curiosity of it.

I know I'd be tempted, but man is it annoying to be on the receiving end, and I know that from awkward (and in retrospect funny, but still) experience.", "Not an asshole, just a parent stuck in the 80s.", "YTA - I am 52 (shout out to 70s babies) and can confirm you are stuck in some puritan 80s. Your daughter's relationship with her friend seems weird to *you* not to them. Unless your daughter is getting hurt or is hurting others, stay out of it.", "Thanks for the opinion that WASNT asked for. Mind your business. YTA", "Very gentle YTA, as your kid is old enough to be running her own friendships. One thing I think you **could** say is that you\u2019d prefer that she not comment on her friends\u2019 asses in front of you.", "NAH just a generational culture clash. Young people are supportive and complementary to their friend's and their efforts and their bodies. There was nothing flirty about what Nicole said.", "YTA \nI'm in my 20s and I have the same dynamic with my guy and girl friends alike. \nMy mom used to be weirded out too by the way my brother and I interacted with our respective friends, but she's used to it by now.", "Semi YTA. Just because you feel that the dynamic is weird, doesn\u2019t mean you should place your beliefs onto your daughter. It\u2019s a different time and day now compared to when you was her age. Platonic guy and girl friendships/relationships exsist, try and accept that. If things were to eventually blossom between them, it\u2019s nice to know (for her) that she\u2019ll have your blessing but it might never end up that way and that\u2019s fine.", "I think that you didn't mean ill with it, but it does sound like you're a bit stuck in old expectations of dynamics between friends. \n\nPeople who are comfortable with those sorts of comments from friends are capable of discerning that it's friendly banter. And your daughter can comment on a body and still see it as just a body with no further connotation.", "Gentle YTA I'm someone who grew up in the 80s. Your ideas are very old-fashioned. You could do with looking into what you actually mean by what you said to your daughter. What's the basis of this idea you have? Is it perhaps based in dated stereotypes and misogyny that you just never questioned?\n\nBreak down your feelings and thoughts about your opinion and really ask yourself if they're reasonable. Do they really have logic behind them?", "YTA", "You're not being the A, you just view things differently but at the same time she is correct that relationship dynamics have changed. Flirty banter is often seen as a norm and it's not for us to dictate how others interact.", ">Bill agrees that the dynamic's a bit weird, but it's not up to us to just say that to our daughter.\n\nWhat Bill said. YTA", "yta. useful phrase for you- \"stay in your lane\".", "Soft YTA , talking about someone\u2019s dump truck is normalized now , especially with the gym goers. To be honest it always was normalized between lifters even in the 1980\u2019s. It just hadn\u2019t gotten out into the general culture then.", "Surprise surprise boomer this aint the 1800\u2019s no more.", "YTA", "A very very soft yta. Its uncomfortable for you to watch your daughter compliment a males body, but okay for you to do it right in front of her with your husband. This isnt the 1980's. 25 years old here and this is definitely how we sometimes talk to our friends. I remember in high school. Telling my gay friend they his cologne smelled very good. Would that make you uncomfortable too?", "YTA. Mind your own business keep that up and your daughter won't talk to you.", "As a girl with 3 male roommates that go to the gym with me, YTA. Not every guy/girl intimate interaction has to be romantic.", "I don\u2019t think anyone is TA, but it\u2019s definitely not weird in today\u2019s day and age. If she said it to someone of the same sex, you probably wouldn\u2019t bat an eye. They\u2019re friends.", "Yta - you are stuck in the 80s", "YTA and defs stuck back in time", "NTA, but more like YTOldhead\n\nIt's how Gen Z-ers talk now. They talking about everybody's asses and congratulate each other on it cuz \"booty goals\" in the gym are a thing for EVERY body. They don't mean anything by it. But I actually applaud your instinct to be on guard. More parents need to have it these days, especially regarding male friends. Cuz a lot of this new shit that's supposedly \"liberal feminism\" is really just misogyny under a facemask, and young women are being pushed into sex-positive (instead of sex-critical) conversations they're not actually comfortable with but do it for the sake of their friends and overall culture. But anyway, NTA.", "Very, very gentle YTA and only because it was a teeny bit judgy when you talk about it. Men and women have a different dynamic now-a-days, but I did talk to my adult daughter and son about not being too flirty with someone unless the relationship boundaries are clear. They are adults and can do what they like, of course. I just think sometimes the flirting with a friend who really would like more when they aren't particularly interested can be hurtful and send a mixed message. Maybe that's old-fashioned advice too now.", "I guess by OP\u2019s standards, my gaming friends and I should be married??? If a compliment means they\u2019re dating in their eyes. The stuff we say to each other is waaaaaay racier than that, although not normally said as compliments. \ud83d\ude02 I\u2019m a woman who plays with a bunch of men.", "Maybe because at 48 I'm younger but I disagree. My relationship with friends is similar to the daughter and has always been.\n\nWouldn't call this 89s", "Thank God I wasn't drinking coffee when I read this or I would have bricked my phone.", "Yeah. I know that there are people who think this way, but it's surprising to see them *here*.", "Super controlling behavior.  If they say this they say loads more. My mom is one.", "Right? They sound like they workout together.", "I (f) comment on my besties (m) physique sometimes because I know he\u2019s insecure about his body and has been going to the gym a lot. I will frequently compliment his glutes or biceps in a teasing way. He\u2019s someone who hasn\u2019t been shown a lot of kindness or softness in life, and doesn\u2019t really know how to show it to himself, so I\u2019m determined to show it to him. YTA OP- your daughters friendship dynamic has nothing to do with you", "I'm 46 and have completely platonic guy friends who I would joke around with like this.", "This sounds like pretty normal \"people who are into fitness\" talk, too.", "I was also thinking 1950\u2019s rather than 1980\u2019s.", "Right? More like just being uptight. I get it, I have to remind my wife that if it isn't hurting anybody, why be judgy about it?", "Pfft and try to be a different person with them? Nah fam. I'm gonna compliment my gym buddies butt IN FRONT OF MY MOTHER lol \n\n(She will generally chime in)", "YTA\n\n>I wish I was making this up\n\nMe too, because this is so incredibly ridiculous to even complain about much less to sit your adult daughter down and lecture her about.", "NTA.... maybe... but you are a little more... conservative than your daughter which isn't really unexpected. You MIGHT have tread accidentally into the \"Slightly asshole\" space at one specific point though.\n\nInitially you were sharing your life experience with her and that's totally fine, but it did elicit an eyeroll. As long as you weren't doing it in that judgy tone we have all heard in our lives, she was likely fine and viewed you as being out of touch \"olds\".  Or, you did use that judgy tone and you need to watch out for that in the future.\n\nWhere it probably went a little off the rails is asking if she was dating him. Presumably, she'd have told you she was if that was the case, or would have in her OWN time. You asking that question made it sound like you don't trust her and/or invading her privacy. That's why she left.", "YTA stop making gen x look so bad, also your daughter is silly, the 80s were also full of interactions like that.", "YTA. But I dont think youre a 'true AH', you are kinda atuck in the 80's though lol. Or at the very least; old fashioned! The comments your daughter made as goofy fun to her friend are fine, i mean its pretty normal and not anything out of the ordinary. People have their own different dynamics with their friends, like how some just do things differently depending on the friend group!", "YTA. I don't know what's wrong with you but your behavior does not seem normal. Why shouldn't she support and compliment her friend?", "NAH", "Somewhat YTA. If she works out in the same gym this would be shared language", "YTA\nLet me be clear, I am a girl, I am the same age as Nicole, and my best friend is a guy.\n\nThere has never been anything more between us, we are adults, we are able to talk and we know that there is nothing more than platonic feelings towards each other, at best I would say it is brotherly, besides he often introduces me as his little sister and I do the same.\n\nIn the same way as here, I wouldn't have any problem to make this kind of remark to him, we are the kind of people who can easily make fun of each other as much as compliment each other, so I guess in a way some people would see it as flirting or something, it's absolutely not the case, I also do it with female friends.\n\nNow I can't describe how many times my family (luckily not my parents and my brother, but my grandparents, uncle, aunt etc) have questioned the nature of our relationship, found it weird, felt obliged to give their opinion and question my life just because they don't experience things the same way, especially at this time of the year ahahaha !\nAnd I can't explain how tiring it is to spend one's life justifying oneself when in the worst case it's only a matter of concern to the people involved and not to the others.Seriously, I've given up but it's still unpleasant to get comments when it's none of their business anyway.\n\nAnd I wouldn't wish that on your daughter from her own parents!\n\nYou already had absolutely no reason to come and ask her and tell her that you thought it was weird, but she also assured you that there was nothing going on between them and that it was normal for her and you continued to doubt!\n\n Obviously YTA if you can't trust your daughter like that and try to be that intrusive with her for no reason. Small YTA since it's not that deep and stuff, but still, it's not cool at all and again, non of your business so why ?\n\nLearn first that there is nothing weird about the PLATONIC relationship between your daughter and her friend, and then just learn to trust your daughter and let her live her relationship as she sees them rather than trying to dicate to her what is a \"normal\" platonic relationship !\nThey are adults and don't need your external doubts !\n\nEdit : typo", "YTA", "YTA. I don't see anything questionable or odd about their friendship dynamic at all.", "Very Mild ESH\n\nYou:  You went about it an in an acceptable way but I don't think there's anything weird about their friendship.\n\nDaughter:  She was being unfair to the 80's.", "NTA, IMO she is sending mixed signals by engaging the way she is, but I'm on autistic spectrum and need firm lines and bounders to relationships, I can't really handle nuance well.", "YTA.  Your daughter is an adult.  The 80\u2019s called and need you to exit.", "YTA really let it go. You sound like you're a little uptight sorry. Please don't pass on those same traits to your kid. sounds like she has a fun relationship with her friend. If her friend is not bothered by it you have no reason to be. If she was commenting on the physical fitness success of one of her girlfriends would you still think it's weird?", "NAH \n\nShe was just basically commenting that her friends workouts are showing results and you read more into that. \n\nThat\u2019s all", "Jesus Christ,when will you boomers fucking learn that things have changed in the past 30 years??", "NAH. It's the generation gap!", "YTA - mind your own fucking business and let your daughter define her friendships for herself and what works for her and her friends.\n\nHave you ALWAYS been this judgemental of her, making her feel like shit when she didn't do things exactly the way you do?\n\nJesus Christ. Some people shouldn't be allowed to have children.", "I'm not calling you an asshole because the youths confuse us all but this is normal stuff for them. NAH", "Soft YTA.   \n\n\nShe's right. She is an adult and can have platonic male, female, or any identity friends and choose the dynamic that works for their friendship. As someone who enjoys going to the gym and working out, her quote is pretty typical of many gym cultures. You comments on his physical appearance, as well, recall.", "\ud83e\udeb6 Feather-light, yta. But only in the sense of having some outdated theories on opposite gender platonic friendships. \n\nI get it. I'm 40. I'd have the same questions about a romantic relationship.

It shouldn\u2019t be any of your concern.", "Soft YTA.\n\n33 male here, complimenting friends when they're working hard is great support! Male, female,doesn't matter.", "YTA, though this does seem to be more of a\u2026cultural? generational? Difference than malicious. Her dynamic with him sounds completely normal for platonic friends to me.", "I am 53 say stuff like that to male and female friend.

Stop being controlling.", "Yta keep your antiquated opinions to yourself daughter or not mind your business", "Soft YTA. I'm a weightlifter/gym rat, and some of the banter between the gals and guys on our team would make you blush crimson. But there's nothing in it, and most of that group are fast friends outside the gym, including their respective partners. Nicole is right - she interacts with her friends on her own terms, not on your 30 year old idea of how relationships should be conducted.", "YTA. Though the way you narrate it seems like you are an understanding person. You just need to be more open minded and slowly lose the conservative and traditional thinking. In this modern era boys and girls can be 'intimate' (I don't know how to word it ahahaha) when teasing or playing each other. Especially if you're really close to someone, people would often mistake you as partners because nowadays people can interact so closely without being romantic. You just have to remember that we are now in the 20th century and not in the 90s.", "YTA and stuck in the 80s.

NAH, just relax a little life\u2019s too short.", "YTA I am in my 50\u2019s and would be thrilled if my daughter saw a man as another human being and not a sex object. Seriously. Every male/female(if we solely focus on heterosexuality as you are stuck in the 70\u2019s) interaction is not about flirting. Seriously. Get thine heads out of the mud and look at the world we live in.", "idk i am in my 20\u2019s and i wouldn\u2019t say that to a friend. nah", "A very light YTA. It may be a running joke in their friend group. You're interrogating this too deeply. Be like Elsa and let it go.", "Soft YTA, I think you have good intentions but you're very out of touch. 46 here, but I can say that this is actually very normal playful banter between friends, regardless of their gender/sex. That was pretty tame an innocent and I think you panicked. I get it. Please rethink your approach.", "Even if it is/was weird (which most here are suggesting it isn't/wasn't), your daughter was hurt. I would suggest that you take some time to unpack where your discomfort is coming from. Why did it make you feel uncomfortable exactly? What are the expectations you have about what makes for a non-weird interaction? Where do your expectations about gender come from and why? Once you have done that hard work, you might then have a conversation with your daughter, which should probably involve an apology and lots of open-minded listening (mostly on your part).", "Maybe just don't make comments on her relationships, if she asks fine, otherwise best to not say anything.", "YTA for bringing it up. I think you\u2019re just really out of touch which is okay", "YTA but not like overly so. Definitely stuck in the 80s lol jk but seriously. You seem to have made the situation into more than what it was and it seems to have made your daughter uncomfortable. I think you should just stay out of it. It\u2019s really not your place.", "YTA\n\nLol. It's just how kids are these days.", "YTA just because you didn't do it doesn't make it wrong or weird...
