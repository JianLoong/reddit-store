They have had problems with gifts being stolen before but still want the Christmas tree to have gifts under it.\n\nWhere I work I can get a lot of boxes and scored a good deal on some wrapping paper and ribbons. So I get some EMPTY boxes from work and wrapped them up using pine cones to give them some weight. Only in the last one I placed a red and sliver glitter bomb inside. To be sure and maybe use it as a prank later, I use the ribbons to mark the gift boxes and take pictures just incase I forget. There was a total of 9 placed under the tree.\n\nNot even a week after putting them out do 3 gifts go missing. A bit worried but mostly annoyed, the director and I brush it off but tell the other employees/volunteers to keep their eyes open. The day after one of the volunteers is yelling at the receptionist while covered in red and sliver glitter\u2026\n\nApparently the lady thought they had given her two kids(8F and 10M) gifts, only to find out that it was just yard trash inside. The lady then opened the 3rd gift and her whole house was covered in glitter. She demanded money for cleaning and emotional destress. Honestly she was laughed out by the director who told her to leave.\n\n I learned this today from a volunteer who said the glitter bomb was a AH thing to do, even when I pointed out the gift had been STOLEN, other volunteers agreed and said I was an AH. Even though the director told me it was funny and was sorry he didn\u2019t get it first. \n\nThe kids still come to the programs but are picked up and dropped off by their dad who is annoyed by the glitter he keeps finding. The kids also apologized for taking the gifts because their mother told them to.\n\nSo am I the AH for making a glitter bomb that got stolen?\n\nEdit:\n\n- The Glitter BOMB was not ment to catch a thief. It was ment to be a prank on the director who loves glitter.\n\n- Some of the volunteers have been working with the director for YEARS so he trusts them, and I would like to believe they are not thrives.\n\n- The years before, ALL gifts where stored in an unlocked supply closet. The director has changed it this year and trusts me with the more valuable items.\n\n- The gifts where set up on a stage that is 4 ft off the ground, it was set up to look like a living room, and the two access doors to get up on the stage where locked. A kid jumping up on stage would have been noticed.\n\n- All employees and volunteers of the community center should have been told the gifts on stage where just for decoration. Only a few employees knew one box had glitter in it incase it needed to be moved.\n\n- The woman who stole the gifts is banned form the center but her kids and husband are allowed to attend. The kids have also apologized for taking the gifts and like my ribbons and glitter.\n\n- An officer that patrols the area had to escort the woman out, but told us that we couldn\u2019t press charges because there was no monetary loss on our end.\n\n- While the staff and director get a good laugh about this event, most of the volunteers are not to happy with me. One has already tired to tell me the wrong date of a meeting not knowing the director can text me himself and vise versa.", "created_utc": 1701828584, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18bt59h/aitah_for_making_a_glitter_bomb_gift_that_was/", "score": 3303, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
