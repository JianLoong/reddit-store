They have had problems with gifts being stolen before but still want the Christmas tree to have gifts under it.\n\nWhere I work I can get a lot of boxes and scored a good deal on some wrapping paper and ribbons. So I get some EMPTY boxes from work and wrapped them up using pine cones to give them some weight. Only in the last one I placed a red and sliver glitter bomb inside. To be sure and maybe use it as a prank later, I use the ribbons to mark the gift boxes and take pictures just incase I forget. There was a total of 9 placed under the tree.\n\nNot even a week after putting them out do 3 gifts go missing. A bit worried but mostly annoyed, the director and I brush it off but tell the other employees/volunteers to keep their eyes open. The day after one of the volunteers is yelling at the receptionist while covered in red and sliver glitter\u2026\n\nApparently the lady thought they had given her two kids(8F and 10M) gifts, only to find out that it was just yard trash inside. The lady then opened the 3rd gift and her whole house was covered in glitter. She demanded money for cleaning and emotional destress. Honestly she was laughed out by the director who told her to leave.\n\n I learned this today from a volunteer who said the glitter bomb was a AH thing to do, even when I pointed out the gift had been STOLEN, other volunteers agreed and said I was an AH. Even though the director told me it was funny and was sorry he didn\u2019t get it first. \n\nThe kids still come to the programs but are picked up and dropped off by their dad who is annoyed by the glitter he keeps finding. The kids also apologized for taking the gifts because their mother told them to.\n\nSo am I the AH for making a glitter bomb that got stolen?", "created_utc": 1701828584, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18bt59h/aitah_for_making_a_glitter_bomb_gift_that_was/", "score": 323, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am absolutely baffled as so how she's trying to say she thought it was for her kids? Does she think the presents under the trees at shopping centres are also for her kids? Why take 3 when she has two kids?\n\nI have a christmas tree at my office. It has decorative \"presents\" under it (empty boxes with wrapping paper). Why would anyone think those are a) real or b) for them personally?", "NTA at all!!! So what if it's a pound of glitter? She ordered her kids to steal gifts that would otherwise go to other children in need. Yes I get that it's a b**** to clean up, but it's an even b****ier thing to have your kids steal from others, and then when you get caught demand compensation for it!!! Was it petty? A little, but you taught her kids a valuable lesson and saved 3+ gifts for the other children. You shouldn't feel bad about it.

Apparently they were suppose to be free gifts to people according to her. \n\nDon't steal and you won't get glitter bombed. She only has herself to blame.", "NTA at all. Sticky fingers who stole from a program her children attend should be ashamed of herself. But, I guess some people aren\u2019t capable of shame?

He not only rigged glitter, but also a stink bomb, and a camera to take footage of the thief getting his come-uppance. \n\nThe only thing here that MIGHT be slightly asshole-ish is that glitter contributes to pollution.\n\nBut the real AH here is the thief who is setting a bad example for her kids.
