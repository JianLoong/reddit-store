They can learn to wait until 7 am. Let them either A open on gift before bed time or B make some awsome Christmas stockings and a good movie to keep them occupied.", "YTA. Our parents made a firm rule from the start, we could get up as early as we wanted, but we had to stay in our room and play *quietly* until 7am, then *they* would come get us, and we would all Go see \"what Santa brought\" for the first time together. Stockings included. I would imagine that your husband was grumpy because his wife encouraged her children to disobey his very reasonable request right in front of him and then called *him* the baby. Can't imagine you'd be too particularly pleased if he did the same to you.", "YTA.\n\nChildren can be allowed their stocking (ours always had a comic book and a tangerine, and gifts opened after breakfast.\n\nThere are very few years where kids fervently believe in the magic of Christmas.  If your husband was refusing to get up by dawn, that is a bit different, but it is a shame you deprived him of their joy.", "NTA. So the kids were so excited they got up early, ONE day of the year! Times that by a limited number of years before they're too grown to be as excited. Christmas IS FOR KIDS, it's the parents' job to make it magical for them & make happy memories! You don't have TWO kids, you have THREE, because your husband is a big spoiled whiny baby.", "YTA. No one wants to be up at this time of day. You need to agree an appropriate time in advance and both stick to it. Our earliest is 7.30. No sooner. The children all pile into one room on Xmas Eve and wake up together and keep each other company until the time comes for them to get up. As others have said, stockings are a good way to keep them amused.", "YTA. I learned to entertain myself for a few hours when I was very young because my mom worked long hours as a nurse and my dad has severe PTSD from Vietnam and sleep is very precious to him when he can get it. Mom would probably have a Christmas movie in the VCR and fast forwarded to the beginning of the movie so I just had to turn on the TV and watch quietly. Or I could color, or play Oregon Trail on the computer\u2026anything until my parents were both ready to be up. \n\nBesides, we did it at my grandparents house one year and the old Catholics made me go to church first, so I learned waiting for mom and dad wasn\u2019t that bad compared to grandma and grandpa.", "[removed]", "NAH it's Christmas!!

We have a rule for our kids, now 6 and 9, that they can get up whenever they want and go through their (well stocked) stockings but to let us sleep until 7 and no presents until after we all eat breakfast.

So I'm going with NAH but communication was lacking?", "YTA - for the way this was handled and for the time. Unless there is something about those kids that they cannot be left alone in their room unsupervised until a later time, send \u2018em back. \n\nBuilding up a little more expectation energy for the kids won\u2019t harm them. Probably make their experience that much more enjoyable. They had to wait all month for this morning. A few more hours won\u2019t hurt. \n\nAnd you guys need to work this stuff out as a couple. Being the parent seen as the final decision maker is not good for being a unified team as seen by your kids. This sets up a pattern where the kids learn that they can always ask mom for a different ruling in the future. \n\nAnd why don\u2019t you have instructions to your kids not to get up until X:XXam in advance???", "Absolutely not the asshole.

Dad worked nights so loved his sleep when we woke Mum up Dad used to ask \u2018Has that man been?\u2019 over his shoulder and go back to sleep.

Would it have killed them to go back to bed until 6am? I was told to go back to bed as a child and it didn\u2019t upset me, only built up the excitement and anticipation. Parents just won\u2019t say no anymore. YTA!", "YTA. It would still be Christmas an hour or two later. Most families tell their kiddos to go back to bed. In my family, we were allowed to grab our stockings until the rest of the family woke up.", "YTA.  The 6yo is old enough to read a digital clock.  You tell them they can get out of bed when it reads 6 or 7am and they can have their stockings until you get up.\n\nOr you say, you stay in your room until X time or you set an alarm, you stay here until it goes off.", "YTA. I can see just getting up if it's 6:00 a.m., but 4:45 a.m. is too early. Your kids are old enough to hang out on their own until the more reasonable time and if you're really okay with getting up that early that is fine, but there's no reason to wake up your spouse as well.", "Good parenting is not saying ignore the other parent.   It makes it look like that do not have to listen to them.   Parents has to be on the same page.    If one parent says no, then the answer is no.", "YTA. You just showed your husband you don't respect him or his boundaries and that any time your kids don't like his answer they can just ask you so you've also completely undermined his authority in the household hierarchy. Kids can learn and go back to bed. My parents would let us open our stockings before we woke them up but we had to wait until at least 7am. My dad also usually worked until 3p on Christmas day so we didn't open presents until after dinner.", "YTA - That's too damn early, Christmas or not.

Husband is a jackass and you are NTA.", "Yeah, it feels a little harsh to call you T A when I get that you were just excited about the kids being excited about Christmas, but YTA. As an adult who is not an early riser, my concern would have been less the kids napping and more me feeling out of it all day. Especially if I had not been planning on getting up that early, I would be tired and cranky all day. It's a holiday for him too. There are lots of good suggestions here for ways to keep the kids busy while letting dad sleep a little more. I would definitely implement some of them next year.", "YTA for saying your kids don't need to listen to their father.", "Nta for indulging your kids but you could just as easily said \"guys, santa won't have made it to our place yet, go back to bed and keep your ears open for bells or reindeer hooves, but keep the noise down, they can hear you\".", "NTA. In my household growing up my mother wouldn\u2019t let us open gifts until 9 am. At the time it seemed lame bc it was a day off but also she was a SAHM. I feel even more strongly about it as an adult. \n\nYour husband is an AH for his tereible attitude and saying you ruined his Xmas. If anyone ruined Xmas it was him with his bad vibes. He was wrong for letting it affect the day. \n\nI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a right answer to the time disagreement btw. In the future it might be a good idea to set a time that everyone agrees to. It\u2019s just about setting the expectations.

So what if he woke up slightly earlier than he wanted, it\u2019s once a year. He\u2019ll survive. A good rule we had with our kids was, you cannot wake us up before full daylight. That always worked for us!", "Yeah, YTA.  At least one of your kids is old enough to tell time.  4:45 is entirely too early for the kids to be waking you up for Christmas morning.  Sure\u2026your kids got to take a nap later.  What about your husband?  Did he get a chance to catch up on his sleep?  How late was he up putting together the Santa stuff?  \n\nYou need to figure out a routine for Christmas morning.  Ours was that they had to wait until 7 am to wake us up but stockings were fair game to explore.  There is absolutely no harm in teaching children about boundaries.  And no kid was ever harmed by delayed gratification.", "NTA. Why even have kids if you're going to pout through the kid things? One of the greatest blessings of my divorce was knowing my ex wouldn't be ruining any more Christmas mornings with his pouting and complaints.", "Some of my fondest memories are of waking up at like 3am going to wake my parents up and being told I had to wait, it sounds silly but waiting and trying to figure out what the presents were imagining new stuff, it was fun! They usually let me open my Stocking to hold me over too. NAH imo but it's totally reasonable to have your kids wait", "NAH.\n\nWhat you should have done is communicated ahead of time about what an acceptable time is, and what the plan was.  Then you two aren't fighting, or having one overrule the other first thing in the morning.\n\nYour husband was OK to be slightly annoyed to have his desire overridden though, 5am IS early.  However, he's an adult, so he should have also just rolled with it and taken a nap himself later.\n\nNext year talk about what time to get up the day BEFORE, and work together on a plan.", "YTA. In my family presents are opened with the family AFTER breakfast. And if family is coming over for a late breakfast? Guess what? we wait until they come - yes that can be after 11am. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t kill the kids to wait a bit longer - they waited all year after all. \n\nGive them a stocking with small gifts and sweets to open when they awaken.\n\nInform them the day before when family gift sharing will begin so they know what is expected - hold your ground if they push back or complain. They will learn to wait.", "YTA\n\nYou told your kids to ignore their father. Yup, you ruined Christmas.", "YTA. You over road your husband in front of the kids. Is this a pattern in the relationship? You should be making decisions together.", "YTA, 4:45am is wayyyyy too early to start Christmas. I get that the kids are excited but that is crazy. We use an awake clock in my house and it\u2019s a lifesaver.", "YTA \n\nTelling kids they don\u2019t need to listen to another parent\u2019s *very reasonable* instructions? Gross.", "NTA.

You did good, tell the bear that the Christmas magic you're seeing in their eyes now won't last much longer.", "The kids are only small for a short while.  He can take a nap!", "What time to get up on Christmas Day is something you two should have talked about with each other and then with the kids before the big day. \n\nTelling kids to ignore someone on Christmas isn\u2019t in the spirit of Christmas. Neither is it in the spirit of Christmas to hold a grudge. Both of you could do better.", "YTA. If he\u2019s a working man I\u2019m sure he wanted the extra sleep on his day off. Kids don\u2019t need to have their every whim indulged. Many many households, as evidenced even in these comments, have rules about what time you can wake up and open presents. It\u2019s not fair to undermine his stance, and it\u2019s also not great parenting to show the kids they can make the rules. You failed here.", "ESH obviously undermining your husband is an issue but i\u2019m not sure why he gets to decide that children should have to wait in their rooms because adults can\u2019t be tired. Wild.\n\nit\u2019s Christmas day and 5am is definitely morning time for most parents. If you don\u2019t want your kids to bother you on christmas morning and you want to sleep in then i\u2019d question why you would have kids. Are all the rest of the commenters not parents? 5am is day time, if you think that\u2019s too early then you need to go to bed earlier", "YTA. 4:45am is ridiculous, especially for a day that is so long and action packed for so many. It wasn't like he was asking for a lie in - another hour or two was more than reasonable. \n\nYou undermined him. Then expected him to function on minimal sleep as well. No wonder he was grumpy. Most people would be. \n\nWe know kids are wild, and excitable, especially on Christmas Day but expecting him to wake up that early is unfair.", "YTA - for telling your kids to ignore what their dad said, way to undermine your coparent OP \n\nI could understand your argument more (sort of) if it was after 8am and he still wasn't up - but 4:45?!?!? As a mother of 2 - HELLLLLLLL no. It's still dark outside!\n\nThe gifts from Santa aren't wrapped at my house (same with the stockings obv), and my kids know they can get into that stuff whenever they wake up. But the rest of the presents are getting opened at 7:00am at the absolute earliest - usually closer to 730 tbh", "YTA.  Teaching patience is important. You needed to set a time the night before that you and your husband agreed upon.  Maybe 7:00 or something. And you need to stick to it.", "ESH. This should have been something you talked about and decided upon together as a family before 4 am. \n\nThis is coming from someone who told their kid no earlier than 5am  and gave the kid an alarm  clock and told them where to look when it said 5. I tried talking him into 6. It wasn't happening, lol.  My kid was practically vibrating with excitement. Pattering his feet wildly with excitement while standing over me.... all at 4:45am. He kept running around between peeking at Santa's presents and the clock and my bedroom.... while screaming, \"It's almost 5! Can we go!\". My kid is 7. So a little older than yours. But this trick worked when he was your kids' ages.  \n\nThe key point: is that my husband and I agreed beforehand that this was the plan.  \n\nI think most people know there's no stopping children with this level of excitement, so I get why you over rode your husband,  but acting like a child is not someone I'd want to be married to either.   \n\nIf there is a next year with your husband,  maybe try \"they can only get up when a small present is placed outside their door?\"  Again... I  stand by ESH because of the fact that you both didn't anticipate this happening as this is very common behavior for young children on Christmas and plan for what to do... together.", "NTA, but it doesn\u2019t hurt children to have rules. We weren\u2019t allowed to get up until Mom had made her coffee at about 7. She\u2019d turn on the Christmas lights and pull the hall closet door open so we could only peek past it. Dad wasn\u2019t a morning person so that gave him time to sleep in a bit. \n\nOur stockings were pinned to our beds and the thrill of pulling little items out of my stocking in the dark and feeling everything carefully to guess what it might be was delicious. I\u2019d delay turning on my light because I enjoyed the sense of mystery so much.", "YTA - I can\u2019t think of anyone who is or wants to open presents and be celebratory at 4:45 in the morning. My mom always told me I couldn\u2019t wake her up until a certain time on Christmas Day (7-7:30 was the time she set). 6 and 4 are definitely old enough to get that. In the future maybe give your boys things to keep them occupied until a time that you and your husband BOTH agree is appropriate to be woken up.", "YTA - only because this should not just be a unilateral decision. You need to talk about these things and agree on what to do. Some ppl are cool with insane early wakeups. My agreement with my son is 7 am at the earliest to wake me up and I get 30 mins to get ready (like grab tea and food and mentally prep for the off the wall bouncing excitement of a 6 year old)", "YTA but this is more of a \"well what the hell did you expect?\"\n\nI'm not even particularly mad that the three of you got up, it's not like the 4 & 6 year olds were gonna go back to sleep anyway.  But *of course* he's going to be pissy the rest of the day, he got loudly woken up before 5am and then completely fucking dismissed on what is *also his* Christmas day.\n\nAnd do you really want to be training your kids that waking mom & dad up at *four forty five in the morning* is a perfectly okay thing to do?", "ESH.  Why would you tell the kids to ignore their father?  Kids need to respect their parents.  What if he told them to ignore you?  The correct thing would be to speak to your husband without the kids and tell him they can stay up since they won't be able to sleep more anyway.  He could've slept more if he wanted and you would stay up.  Why are you trying to undermine him?  Kids should never be told to ignore their parents.  I would be so pissed if my husband said that to our kids.\n\nHe sucks for getting pissy over his kids waking up early.  That's his family and he should be grateful he has a family for the holidays, many people do not.  He also sucks for saying you ruined his Christmas.  That's crappy behavior and unacceptable imo for a parent to act that way.", "I'm going against the grain and saying NAH.  Every year growing up myself or one of my siblings would wake up, run and check the tree, then wake the other siblings exclaiming \"Santa came Santa came!!!\" And then we'd wake up our parents.  Mom would say \"call Grandma and tell her\" and grandma would be already awake having coffee waiting on our call.  It was so great and exciting.  Then as we got a bit older we'd still do it, but mom and dad would need coffee, mom would need cigarette breaks, and we'd be up for hours just sitting there waiting. Grandma would go to our aunt's first because she knew it would be a while before we started and she didn't want our cousins waiting on her waiting on us.  So then we had to wait even longer because Mom wanted grandma there.  \n\nNow for my own kids, I wake up at 6, and I'm ready.  These punks sleep until 9-10:30 every year and I'm just like c'mon c'mon c'mon wake up!!! If they woke up before me and excitedly woke me up I'd be so happy.  We'd open gifts and then I'd take a nap with them later.  \n\nIt just sounds like different views for Christmas morning and that's okay.  You didn't know he was going to be that moody about it ahead of time.  Now you do and you can make a plan for next year.  Him saying you ruined Christmas for an hour difference is pretty dramatic and feels like he just wanted to punish you for not getting his way.  It's Christmas.  Work it out for next year and just enjoy the day sheesh.  Take in the kids excitement and don't make it about yourselves.", "YTA.

Trying to somehow demand calm or extra sleep once they're up is not a fight anyone's going to win-- and when my mother tried to say that I wasn't even allowed out of my bed until 9 AM on xmas day some years into my childhood, she really cemented the whole feel of that holiday as an obligation to putting her feelings above everyone else's. The wise move, if more sleep had to happen this year, would have been to pull the kids into bed for snuggles. I'm not a morning person AT ALL now, but if I have to get up and go at 5 AM once in a while, I can. I'm just nauseated and headachey for like 40 min. (which is why my father always started breakfast; my mother didn't pick at me as badly if she had coffee first). \n\nBtw, I'm completely out of contact with my parents now because of the special treatment my mother always demanded and how my father always gave in and forced me to do the same. \"That's just how he is; it's easier not to fight,\" is not something a kid should hear about their parent unless that parent is seriously ill or injured.

Stockings are allowed until 7am and THEN you can wake up Mom and Dad!", "Yup - it was 7am for me growing up. I could be in the living room with my stocking but I couldn\u2019t wake my parents until 7am. The anticipation was great wondering what was in all the new boxes!", "Same. My kids weren\u2019t allowed to get up before 5am (so they didn\u2019t catch Santa in the act), and they couldn\u2019t wake me up until 6am but were allowed to go through their stockings and whatever Santa brought them that was unwrapped. I always made sure that the stockings had several small items that were wrapped (I would literally wrap a roll of Lifesavers lol), and opening those was enough to keep them busy until they came and got me.", "My parents did a similar thing with the \"Santa\" present. They'd come out with us to see what Santa brought and then go back to bed while we played with it. Santa normally brought the big stuff like a dollhouse and it would always be unwrapped, set up and ready to play with so they could get an extra rest.", "Your kids are lucky, my mom made us wait until 7, and if we were at dad\u2019s we had to wait until 8! To be fair though, when at dad\u2019s we did go to the 11 pm service, so didn\u2019t go to bed until after midnight\u2026", "My rule for my kids is the sun has to be up.", "My parents had to make a rule like this when my brother and I were kids, because of this exact situation. My brother would try to wake my parents before the sun had even come up, and they were NOT having any of it. So they made a rule we had to wait until 8 am LOL.", "All of this, plus wasn't it a Christmas tradition, waiting in until mom said it was okay to wake dad up? Looking at the beautiful tree and wondering what was in all the beautifully wrapped packages? That's what I remember about childhood Christmas, not a single gift, but the anticipation...", "There was a time in my life where Christmas was one of 6 days off a year (not counting Sunday\u2019s but I worked Saturday). No way was I getting up at 4:45", "OP is an asshole because she undermined her husband's parental authority over his kids, then called him a big baby because of his understandable reaction. Hope this helps!", "I too am the grumpy, don\u2019t do mornings, parent, thankfully my wife is in agreement that 7 is the earliest that the kids can wake us, we do the stockings on their door so they have stuff to open if they are up early. There is so much to do on Xmas day trying to do it all on a couple of hours sleep and actually enjoy it is very hard.", "Lmao, mine slept in this year. Their dad wasn't getting home from work till 11:30am, so they knew damn well we weren't doing presents until later. My oldest slept till 9, which is also when the 3 year old woke me up. He had zoomed right past the tree and found the cardboard boxes I'd had the presents in. He was shuffling around in it and saying he was in his Christmas boat. Agreed with YTA. Kids are fine getting sent back to bed at 4:45 in the freaking morning. They can learn some patience, just like OP can learn not to undermine her husband in front of the kids. Parents have to present a united front, unless one is REALLY out of line.", "Right, I loved sleeping in. We were allowed to open stockings but presents were after breakfast once everybody had time to get ready. Especially considering parents were usually up all night wrapping and putting shit together.", "Googled \"ready to wake clock\" -- what a clever tool. Thanks for broadening my horizon a bit.", "Exactly, they should be given a set time. Watch a Christmas movie or something if they're up that early & tell them the start time will be 7:30 or something.\n\nMy dad got up between 9 & 10 normally, we got our stockings then read Christmas books or watched something like Frosty the Snowman.\n\nYou don't wake people up that early.", "This. And this is exactly why OP's husband was grumpy. She completely undermined him in front of the kids. \n\nThat's a giant no-no in parenting. It's OK to ask questions, it's OK to point out, \"Actually, we had already agreed that...\", but never ever override the decision of the other parent. \n\nIf you don't like it, you grit your teeth and stick with it, then discuss your disagreement in private.", "Maybe because they\u2019re 6 and 4\n We used to get up super early and the. Go back to bed after we opened gifts. That\u2019s the fun part when they\u2019re little", "YTA\n\nAside from the commenter above who is exactly right. \n\nPerhaps your husband was concerned he'd miss out on the big present opening and being a part of it, seeing his kids joy when they opened things. He was worried you were the only one getting that moment which can't be recreated. I could easily see him being upset at missing that for a selfish move by his wife, who also dismissed him. Either he faked some cheer or it was real, that's not really an issue, that's him being a parent so his kids can have the best day. \n\nThe kids can be excited, the kids can have a nap all they like in the middle of the day. But the kids can't get up that early in the morning, it's not reasonable even accounting for excitement. \n\nIn my own house, we weren't allowed up until 6.00am which was about 1.5 hours earlier than our usual time to get up for school. Breakfast had to come first, even just a bowl of cereal. we could look at the tree, what sizes and shapes were wrapped under it, but not allowed to open anything. \n\nBut the parents are \"always on\" from the moment the kids get up til they are back in bed later that night, it's a full day of cheer and magic and fun to keep going. And my own oldies stayed until about 3am to set things up. \n\nAnd god! Do people need sleep! It's tough to set things up, to afford it, to keep the merry going. It can be exhausting, and getting interrupted 1.5 hours early might be a third of the short sleep he'd be getting, it's hard to function that way.", "I want to upvote this x100000", "4:45 is such a ridiculous time to be awake!  It\u2019s still dark outside and Santa is still working!  What if he hasn\u2019t came yet and the kids went downstairs to no gifts!  Mom would had ruined Christmas.", "But he was telling them they shouldn\u2019t listen to their mother. \n\nNeither one is the \u201cdecider.\u201d They should have had a time out to discuss. Hard to do at 4:45am, so I understand why it didn\u2019t happen. \n\nBut this will happen again. They need to discuss how to handle these kinds of things in the future, when a decision has to be made \u201con the field.\u201d First one responding rules? Flip a coin?", "She's an asshole for telling her kids to ignore another parent.", "YTA btw", "You've totally glossed over the part where OP told her children to ignore their father, trampling all over his reasonable boundary.", "That's not a healthy way to deal with being upset.", "Seriously it\u2019s Christmas the kids were never gonna go back to sleep, my nephew was up at. 3.45 then we were all up.", "Hard disagree. My kiddos are now in their early 20s and for many years now we all enjoy sleeping in, a nice brunch, and opening presents all together instead of the \u2018Santa crazed present grab\u2019. OP deserves the YTA for raising selfish pouty children that do not consider that Christmas is for everyone, family time, not just about presents.", "YTA imo for the husband", "Your dad is spot on!  I felt the same way when my kids were little.  Besides, I was just as excited as they were about what Santa left for them.  \n\nAlso, when I was growing up, I was always the kid that was up first, and after about 7, and could tell time, I had to wait until 7 am before I could wake up my mom and dad.  There were two tasks that had to be completed before I could wake up the house.  First, I had to make the coffee for my dad (sorry Pops, I know that coffee was awful!), and then make the pitcher of orange juice (the frozen concentrate stuff).  Then I would wait, impatiently, for 7 am to wake everyone up - my sisters and brothers hated me...haha.  I hated waiting, so I made sure my kids never had to wait.  As they got older, I really hated that they slept in so late.  It's one day a year, and in reality the wonder and excitement lasts just a few short years. \n\nOP, NTA...at least in my opinion.", "Real world? Didn\u2019t say \u201cdon\u2019t wake up.\u201d My experience is that a child can be instructed not to wake the adults up until a time certain or when it\u2019s okay to start the festivities. \n\nAlso, in what world do kids make the rules? That\u2019s a path to misery. I see the main problem in this fact pattern is that there was a lack of clear instructions the night before as to what the expectations will be. That said, Merry Christmas!", "Yes! I always get my kids to bring them in my room and sit on the floor/bed to open them together so I can watch and they can see what each other get. They're teenagers now and I still do it. Husband usually sleeps through it.\nMy Mum let me open mine when I woke up but although I loved my stocking, it was quite lonely (big age gap with siblings). Also stopped getting a stocking around age 12, while I've vowed to keep doing them as long as I can.", "One of my favorite Christmas memories was running to the tree to see all the stuff quietly before anyone else woke up. I knew to look but not touch. And there would usually be a big present unwrapped that I would stare at with excitement.", "I\u2019ve never heard of a tradition of waiting until mom says it\u2019s okay to wake dad up. We always just jumped on the bed and woke up our parents, but I guess we did it late enough in the morning no one minded.", "Right. We ate breakfast while we waited. And sometimes dad would pretend to be asleep to get us more excited lol. Then he'd surprise us with a gift. \nMi just can't believe the \"don't listen to your father\" in this situation. Like what?", "I\u2019d be grumpy getting up at 5am. That\u2019s early early.", "You can also say something like \u201chold on, Dad and I need to talk for a second.\u201d", "Mine are 7 and 3. I set an alarm for 8:30am and told them they can\u2019t wake us up before then. They hung out and played together upstairs until their alarm went off, then we all got up and opened presents together.", "Breakfast before Christmas. Boy, you were fun \ud83d\ude44", "No, that's not what he was telling the mother. And flipping a coin? Jesus.", "id wake her up at4 everyday then go back to sleep. probably tell the kids they dont need to listen to her then tell her quit being a baby", "He's the asshole because his wife told his kids they can ignore their father? Mom is a gaping asshole, unquestionably.", "No I meant OP is the AH because of what she did to her husband"]}
