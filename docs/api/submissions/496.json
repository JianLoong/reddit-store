I understand you have a severe phobia which you cannot control and were just looking for the bare minimum of support in a moment of panic. As a friend she should be more understanding of your phobia and also *not* say something is abuse, when it blatantly is not.", "Forget the fact that a therapist should understand phobias; any halfway-decent *friend* should be understanding when you're having a visceral reaction like that.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - any friend, therapist or not, would respect a phobia. Her calling you abusive was gaslighting, which is the last thing anyone would expect from a friend, let alone one who is a therapist and knows what the word abusive means in the real world. Abusive is way beyond telling someone you thought they'd understand phobias because of their job (unless you were meaner than that and paraphrased).", "NTA - You are 100% correct.", "NTA. aside from her being a therapist she\u2019s your FRIEND. and she\u2019s making u feel small over a phobia you can\u2019t help. \u201cyou\u2019re being abusive\u201d is crazy manipulative", "NTA. Any decent friend would be understanding of a phobia. But the fact that she is someone who knows that you truly can\u2019t control your anxiety over this is what makes it even worse. Off the clock or not, I would not want or trust a therapist that acts this way outside of the office.", "I don't think you two were such great friends to begin with.\n\nNTA a friend in general (no matter what their job) would have been nicer about the situation.", "NTA, you weren\u2019t expecting her to be a therapist, you were expecting her to be your *friend*. Friends should care about their friends\u2019 phobias being triggered, and not just be dismissive and say they\u2019re over it and tell you to stop having a panic reaction. She works in a field where she directly interacts with people that can have extreme phobia, she should AT LEAST have understood that you couldn\u2019t control your fear reaction, and that\u2019s all she has to do. Instead she invalidated your phobia and got sing song-y about it. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have raised your voice, however, i highly doubt  that you are able to be perfectly composed after a phobia response.", "NTA I\u2018m scared people like that can become therapists", "So because *you* don\u2019t have coping skills, *she* is a bad therapist?\n\nYTA", "YTA for expecting her to constantly be on the clock. Many intense professions like therapists don\u2019t always carry over to their personal lives as they put all their patience and empathy into their job. \n\nIf your phobia is this severe, you need an actual therapist. Stop expecting your friends to be your personal therapists.", "YTA. She\u2019s not YOUR therapist. She gets to be human, too, and maybe the human side of her, not the working side of her, was annoyed. You can\u2019t have both a therapist and a friend in the same person. It\u2019s expressly forbidden to have personal relationships with clients. \n\nAlso, it sounds like you could use a therapist for this issue.", "YTA - she isn\u2019t your therapist. This is about you and your lack of skills to cope. You can\u2019t always expect someone to save you.  Work with YOUR therapist to build skills so you can handle these encounters.", "YTA. Having a phobia does not excuse your hysterical behavior and a therapist does not help phobic people swat away insects that are bothering them. What are you doing to get your phobia under control so you can be in public without embarrassing people?", "YTA- They put up with that stuff from their clients because they are getting paid to, you're just their friend.", "Your friend is YOUR therapist and if a dragonfly flying at you freaks you out this much, maybe you could do with a therapist.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
