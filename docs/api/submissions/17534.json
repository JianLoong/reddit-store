No, it makes way more sense to just do a quick assessment of the kitchen and pantry before you go to the grocery store, since you are literally going to replenish missing items.\n\nEdit:  I\u2019m sure she uses up some of the items herself.

Our success is that we talk and share what's needed as a household. Most chores we split, each doing them together or alternating days or weeks, including car maintenance and yard work. There aren't masculine or feminine chores, just work that needs doing. Very little around the house is specialized labor, and on those (plumbing and electrical) you're better off with a bonded contractor for insurance purposes.\n\nWe also actively try to respect eachothers time. I would not feel like I was being respectful to her if I forced her to look through my leavings to determine what was left of my cereal or whatever. Nor would I feel respected if I had to do that. Not when we can both save ourselves time by just writing down on the whiteboard what we need when we discover we need it. \n\nEspecially when grocery runs include things from all over the house, like light bulbs or air filters for the ac or hygiene products. Tracking all that down and checked every time you go to the store to verify is a huge waste of everyone's time.\n\nAgain, I'm glad your system worked for you while you were married, but I can't imagine it without seeing it causing minor frustrations like what the OP is facing, and those add up over time to create resentment.", "I am single and live alone, and even *I* forget things when i have to play kitchen detective for just my own damn self.

Either of us can add stuff to the supermarket app if we notice a household item is running low. If he forgets, he doesn't complain (to me), just has to suck it up and go shopping himself.", "We have a meal calendar on the side of the fridge and whomever uses the last of something writes it down. This is such an easy fix", "Keep an app on your phone everyone can add items to then check them off in the store. Google Keep is free and great for that.\n\nNTA", "NTA and he\u2019s the AH for refusing to help out, for food he wants to eat no less!\n\nTip for anyone who might find this helpful, you can keep a grocery list (or to get list) on iPhone Notes and share it with someone. You can both edit and add things or check things off. \n\nBeats paper and pencil bc you still have to remember to grab the paper list, most people have their phones on them when they\u2019re out.", "We get groceries delivered which is lovely as you can immediately put it on the list as you grab your spare.", "No need ffs just send a WhatsApp message with the item finished, the cell is never far away nowadays.\n\nNTA your husband is a lazy Ah", "finally a voice of reason.", "Or husband can write it down on a notepad when he finishes something. It takes literally a second to do at the time and saves everyone trying to remember later.", "I think that's a great idea. They can switch chores so the husband does all the shopping and they both occasionally write something down when they need it. Perfectly equal.", "I mean the \u201cmental labor\u201d it takes for him to remember what he finishes or the fact that he could write it down immediately after he finishes something while she seemingly does all the shopping does seem fair. Does both her keeping stock of all groceries including snacks that possibly isn\u2019t for her and just for hubby and stuff she isn\u2019t finishing and buying all the groceries seemingly on her own truly sound like a fair assignment of tasks to you?", ">If it\u2019s equal\u2026then why is the mental labor on him to remind you what to get at the store?\n\nBecause he finished the item and she's the one buying things. It's ridiculous to expect someone to check for what's NOT there to somehow remember what it was and buy it when the person who finished it could just write it down.", "What a weird take.", "Right, but what chore would she take over? And I believe he would just check as he started his chore, so that would probably eliminate the need to write things down", "Depends on who does what and what they have agreed on\u2026like if he\u2019s supposed to be doing laundry, he should check the hampers, not say, \u201cwell she didn\u2019t tell me it was full\u201d", "I have a different opinion, it\u2019s like a husband saying well, \u201cI didn\u2019t do the laundry because I didn\u2019t know the hamper was full! She didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d \n\nThe mental labor is on the one who is in charge of the chore.", "This is what we do. We can all add things to the list. My husband will go in and separate the list into what stores we get those items from. Makes things so easy.", "Just like you said. She takes over the \"mental load\" of writing something down when she uses the last of it. He, in return, does all the shopping and uses her notes to save time. Sure, he would also be responsible for contributing to the shopping list but so is she in the current system.", "Yeah that\u2019s not a fair comparison you can just check laundry hampers to see if they\u2019re full. How is she supposed to remember food that they\u2019re out of if she doesn\u2019t know that they\u2019re out of that food? It would literally take her husband a couple of extra seconds to write it down if they kept a notepad in the kitchen.", "It\u2019s hard to remember something that isn\u2019t there for reference."]}
