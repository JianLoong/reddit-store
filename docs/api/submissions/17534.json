Groceries exist in every room in the house, and it's particularly problematic to require the shopper to do all the checking first if you keep items in their original packaging (e.g., keep cereal in its original box, keep dishwasher tablets in their own container) because then you physically have to go around shaking/opening boxes... I mean, if you only have 1 bowl of cereal left in the box, you definitely still want to buy more cereal, right?\n\nIt's such an easy thing to setup a system - put a piece of paper on the fridge with a magnetic pen so he can write it down as soon as it's out, for example - that's maintained as you go.  To me it's similar to cleaning dishes while you cook -- yes, you COULD just push the dirty dishes to the side and focus on cooking... but that will give you a much longer, harder cleanup job. Why not make things easier on yourself/whoever is doing dishes?\n\nMy person grocery system is now... the grocery jar. I tear off the label and put it in the jar whenver I am low on stuff -- I use sticky notes for milk/produce/etc. It's just me using up groceries, but it's way easier to build my grocery list as I go rather than spent 30+ minutes scouring the house to see what needs to be bought this time.", "If he doesn't tell you or write it down, he can go to the store himself to pick k up more.", "NTA , why wouldn\u2019t he tell you , so when you go shopping again you can easily pick some more of what\u2019s missing up ?", "NTA. You're asking for very reasonable input that actually decreases the total mental load (*both* of you have to note when something's out, rather than *only you* doing an entire inventory every time). Plus, what if a need or want arises that isn't something that you always have/just finished?\n\nPut a whiteboard on the fridge and keep a list.

You have spent the past 8 years tolerating his blame shifting and you should stick to your instinct.  This IS ridiculous and it IS easy to tell you what grocery items you need when you are doing all of the grocery shopping.  And while some people might see this as one tiny hiccup, I see this as a potential symptom of a bigger problem at hand because this has been happening for nearly a decade.  \n\nMarriage is give and take, absolutely, but its ultimately teamwork.  My dad and mom take turns grocery shopping and he has even gone as far as to buy her mensural products when she needs them.  He doesn't bat an eye; they got married because they love each other and part of marriage means you do some of the grocery shopping.  I really hope you don't have children because your husband is leading me to wonder if he thinks spending time with *his* children is babysitting.", "I used to have this issue when I was married.

Does he view your relationship as a true partnership, where you guys are a team, working together to tackle problems and having each others backs? Or does he see the household as a place of rigid hierarchical roles where if everyone just performs their assigned tasks, the place will function and no need to pitch in and help each other out, and each person solves their own problems on their own for their tasks? Which of those relationships would you rather be in?", "NTA.\n\nHave him do the groceries for three months and see how he enjoys the mental, physical, and time load it takes.\n\nHe is an adult, he needs to learn how much effort being a fully functional adult is so he can appreciate all you do.", "NTA and absolutely reasonable request.

Again, it would take less than five minutes to do a quick inventory of all the basic items and see which ones need replacing.", "Incorrect.   She is asking that he tell her every time he finishes the last of a particular item. I am saying that she should have a preconceived list of all of the regular items they buy and then go around and check each one before going to the grocery store.  \n\nWhen I used to do the shopping, it was primarily at Trader Joe\u2019s. I had the whole layout of the store memoriAs so I would write the shopping list in the order of the items as they are arranged in the store. I did the shopping in like 20 minutes.", "Doesn\u2019t really matter. I think that is part of the responsibility of shopping, taking inventory of everything that needs to be replenished.\n\nBut the husband could always do it, and then write out the list for the OP to actually use at the market.", "Here's the caveat, you're speaking based solely on your experience. Some people benefit from more constant reminders. Some people make gradual lists. Some people (myself included) text their partner whenever something runs out, even if we're in the same room talking about what we need to replenish. There is no silver bullet solution, just better communication.", "Haha, oh wow. Happy that worked for you, but if either of us in our marriage offloaded the entire mental load onto someone else like that it would not fly for us.\n\nWe have a small whiteboard in the kitchen. If so.ething runs out, we write it down.

It\u2019s anyone\u2019s experience. Whoever is doing the shopping can take five minutes to take inventory. It\u2019s highly intuitive, due to the nature of the errand. It will work for literally everyone who can write.", "Kitchen detective is super easy. It takes five minutes. I would say there are plenty of tasks where one person does the entire mental load.  If the husband mows the lawn, do you think the wife is the one who keeps the mower topped off with fuel? Takes it in for repairs? Keeps the blades oil or whatever?", "We don\u2019t know what the division of labor is. He could already be doing a number of other things to balance out the labor of having to take inventory before doing the shopping.   \n\nAnd I think it\u2019s not realistic to expect someone to remember every time they use up something. What if she is not around? Does he need to write a note? No, it makes way more sense to just do a quick assessment of the kitchen and pantry before you go to the grocery store, since you are literally going to replenish missing items.\n\nEdit:  I\u2019m sure she uses up some of the items herself. Did she just make a mental note? And what about items that aren\u2019t used up but are low? What if there are only two eggs left in a carton?", "I've been married 20 years come summer. Our success is that we talk and share what's needed as a household. Most chores we split, each doing them together or alternating days or weeks, including car maintenance and yard work. There aren't masculine or feminine chores, just work that needs doing. Very little around the house is specialized labor, and on those (plumbing and electrical) you're better off with a bonded contractor for insurance purposes.\n\nWe also actively try to respect eachothers time. I would not feel like I was being respectful to her if I forced her to look through my leavings to determine what was left of my cereal or whatever. Nor would I feel respected if I had to do that. Not when we can both save ourselves time by just writing down on the whiteboard what we need when we discover we need it. \n\nEspecially when grocery runs include things from all over the house, like light bulbs or air filters for the ac or hygiene products. Tracking all that down and checked every time you go to the store to verify is a huge waste of everyone's time.\n\nAgain, I'm glad your system worked for you while you were married, but I can't imagine it without seeing it causing minor frustrations like what the OP is facing, and those add up over time to create resentment.", "I am single and live alone, and even *I* forget things when i have to play kitchen detective for just my own damn self. For families and folks who cook a lot, there are a zillion little things to track that you might need for a recipe but don\u2019t use all the time. Not everyone has simple standing pantries with the same X boxes of pizza rolls they big every week. I use a list system to track things I need to buy so I don\u2019t have to play kitchen detective. \n\nPeople have different ways of tracking and learning information, neurologically. You are acting like it is universally human to be able to pick up on every needed ingredient and item in just a few minutes, which I know from personal experience is not true.\n\nOP is the one doing all the shopping, and she is asking for one simple favor from her partner to make that chore easier.
