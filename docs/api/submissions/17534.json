No, it makes way more sense to just do a quick assessment of the kitchen and pantry before you go to the grocery store, since you are literally going to replenish missing items.\n\nEdit:  I\u2019m sure she uses up some of the items herself.

Our success is that we talk and share what's needed as a household. Most chores we split, each doing them together or alternating days or weeks, including car maintenance and yard work. There aren't masculine or feminine chores, just work that needs doing. Very little around the house is specialized labor, and on those (plumbing and electrical) you're better off with a bonded contractor for insurance purposes.\n\nWe also actively try to respect eachothers time. I would not feel like I was being respectful to her if I forced her to look through my leavings to determine what was left of my cereal or whatever. Nor would I feel respected if I had to do that. Not when we can both save ourselves time by just writing down on the whiteboard what we need when we discover we need it. \n\nEspecially when grocery runs include things from all over the house, like light bulbs or air filters for the ac or hygiene products. Tracking all that down and checked every time you go to the store to verify is a huge waste of everyone's time.\n\nAgain, I'm glad your system worked for you while you were married, but I can't imagine it without seeing it causing minor frustrations like what the OP is facing, and those add up over time to create resentment.", "I am single and live alone, and even *I* forget things when i have to play kitchen detective for just my own damn self.

To me, that's far more a pain in the ass (and easily ten times more likely to yield a failure-to-identify-needed-item) than writing things that you need as you go.\n\nYou and I have similar issues (e.g., if I think \"oh I need to add kitty litter to the list\" while I'm doing the litter boxes, then I walk downstairs to the kitchen to write that on a list of some kind, I will almost certainly have forgotten why I was going to the kitchen by the time I get there). This is why I have a jar.

What about under the sinks, laundry room, etc.  If I had to check bathrooms and laundry rooms before I could go shopping, thats go upstairs to check bathrooms, down through the main floor and down another set of stairs to the basement to check the laundry room, then back up the stairs to the main floor.

I guess I can audit our lawn care routine, since that interests you for some reason.\n\nIn our house, we split yard work and do it together. Goes faster that way and only takes an hour and a half each saturday or less. One of us mows and then leafblows while the other weedwacks and does the pull-weeding for our gardens and path areas. End result is about the same time. I'd guess my wife mows a bit more often i'd say, because her back hurts more with the weeding due to her job some weeks, and she likes the \"sky cannon\" as she calls the leaf blower. But it's probably 60/40 split. We leave chemical treatments (pest treatment and fertilizer) and irrigation work to monthly contractors. Our tools are battery-powered (mower) or use extension cords (the rest).\n\nIf it matters, we use a combination of extension cords. Some are orange. Others, green. We have a red one but it's only 10ft so it's rarely used. It has an epic tale. It came with a lawn decoration for the holidays (a Christmas dragon inflatable). Home Depot really stepped up their game in 2019.\n\nI hope this satisfies your odd desire to know our lawncare setup.

If you used something up write it there and it gets wiped every time someone goes shopping.  If it's not noted down it wont be refilled.", "They\u2019d just take the last of something and leave the box behind. In all honesty, there was never any malice. More like stupidity!!! :)", "I keep backups of a heap of \"can't run out\" stuff. \nWe add to THE LIST when we open the backup, instead of when something runs out completely. \nWorks well, because I only shop every couple of weeks.", "This is the way", "Because it might be something that you\u2019re using right away I had to take the time to write it down. What if you\u2019re making some food? \n\nYou\u2019re in the middle of making breakfast, are you going to take the eggs out of the carton and set them on the counter so they can roll around (and maybe break) while you find something to write with?\n\nWhat if you use the last toilet tissue?\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I realize that you\u2019re more than likely going to be in the midst of some sort of a task when you use of the last of just about every household item.  \n\nAny of these tasks do not let themselves to stopping in the middle so that you can write something down.  As such, it\u2019s quite easy to forget to write it down after the fact."]}
