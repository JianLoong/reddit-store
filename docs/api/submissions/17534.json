No, it makes way more sense to just do a quick assessment of the kitchen and pantry before you go to the grocery store, since you are literally going to replenish missing items.\n\nEdit:  I\u2019m sure she uses up some of the items herself.

Our success is that we talk and share what's needed as a household. Most chores we split, each doing them together or alternating days or weeks, including car maintenance and yard work. There aren't masculine or feminine chores, just work that needs doing. Very little around the house is specialized labor, and on those (plumbing and electrical) you're better off with a bonded contractor for insurance purposes.\n\nWe also actively try to respect eachothers time. I would not feel like I was being respectful to her if I forced her to look through my leavings to determine what was left of my cereal or whatever. Nor would I feel respected if I had to do that. Not when we can both save ourselves time by just writing down on the whiteboard what we need when we discover we need it. \n\nEspecially when grocery runs include things from all over the house, like light bulbs or air filters for the ac or hygiene products. Tracking all that down and checked every time you go to the store to verify is a huge waste of everyone's time.\n\nAgain, I'm glad your system worked for you while you were married, but I can't imagine it without seeing it causing minor frustrations like what the OP is facing, and those add up over time to create resentment.", "I am single and live alone, and even *I* forget things when i have to play kitchen detective for just my own damn self.
