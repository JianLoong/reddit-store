She\u2019s jeopardizing your housing, they can\u2019t stay. \n\nNTA.", "Remind her of what your lease says and remind her of what you agreed to before moving in together. You can also tell her that you feel disrespected that she made a decision and offer to her parents without even coming to you to discuss options first. \n\nShe may be getting pressure from her parents and they may be the ones saying that they are staying but it is not up to them. \n\nMaybe the could stay one week, rent a place for a week, stay another week, and rent another week, or stay two weeks and then rent two weeks. She needs to be willing to compromise and if not you can say you will go to the property manager.", "NTA but it's clear she isn't looking to follow the lease, which puts your rental in jeopardy. That alone is enough reason to flat out deny them as guests.", "NTA. When you live with another adult - either as roommates or a couple - overnight guests don't get to stay without both of you agreeing in advance, except maybe for one night in a true emergency. Your roommate is being rude and entitled at best, and jeopardizing your housing situation at worst. \n\nI get that these are her parents, and might be willing to overlook it if they were coming in for graduation *weekend*, but no way does she get to invite people to move in to your shared apartment for a month without your voluntary agreement. I get that a graduation is a special event, and I've been to some that might have *felt* like they lasted a month, but since when is it more than a weekend event?  If they can't afford a hotel/AirBnB for a month, they can't afford a month-long trip.", "NTA. \n\nI'd personally try to work something out where they stay on and off. Like a week there, a week in an air bnb if that wouldn't bother you. I'd also check with the leasing office beforehand and let them know the circumstances, graduations are a one time kind thing so they might be very understanding. An entire month+ is definitely pushing it though. \n\nI'd also document everything in case it goes sour so you could present it to your leasing office in the case that she goes ahead and does it anyways, that way you can protect yourself and even possibly get out of a lease with someone that doesn't respect your living boundaries.", "NTA. Tell her you need to talk face to face before you have a meeting with the landlord. She's wildly out of the norm for a roommate request. If you guys had a third bedroom maaaaybe but even then it's really not a reasonable request. She can host her parents like this when she has her own place but not with shared roommates.", "NTA because of the lease. You could get kicked out for that. Just say firmly that more than 2 weeks is simply not possible because of the lease. They can stay for two weeks then have to find alternative accommodation - maybe there is someone else they know nearby, or they could try a hostel, or if they reach out to the local community of whatever country they are from, they might find someone who is willing to rent them a room for a couple of weeks for a reasonable rate.", "NTA because it could cause you to lose your lease. It also goes against your agreement with your roommate and means you lose access to the living room (and your privacy) for an entire month. Was she a friend before you became roomies? Because that's amazingly rude, to tell you rather than ask you.", "NTA.\n\nYour roommate and her parents are being completely unreasonable here. It's incredibly disruptive to have house guests for a few days, a whole month is ludicrous. These are strangers to you, so even a week is a huge ask.\n\nRemind your roommate of your agreement about guests inky staying for a weekend and your lease/contract with the landlord stipulating no guests more than 2 weeks. \n\nYour roommate is a selfish AH.", "NTA, what type of graduation takes a month? If your lease states 14 days toos, that's all your rommate may expect, on top of it, she didn't ask you to begin with, saying no is completely okay. She had to ask first", "NTA. That is way overstepping.", "NTA - if they can\u2019t afford their own accommodation for a month they can\u2019t afford to travel for a month.", "NTA. Agreed a week max. A month is way too long.", "If your lease has that 14 day thing in it they are not messing around and your neighbors will snitch on you and you will lose your place to live. That\u2019s no joke.", "Definitely NTA. That is way too long. Tbh, anything longer than a weekend would be too long for me.", "NTA.  Everyone could wind up on the streets if the manager finds out.  \n\nYour roommate did not discuss this with you beforehand.  \n\nRemind your roommate of the lease.  Try to come up with a compromise.", "NTA. Graduation doesn\u2019t last a month. If they didn\u2019t take such a ridiculously long vacation, they could afford an air bnb", "NTA.  Remind her of the lease and that you are not willing to face possible eviction.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are fine to refuse. One month would be a major intrusion into your home.", "Nta.

No matter what you\u2019ve been told, I\u2019m 99% certain they do not HAVE to come for an entire month.

If they are a bad property manager, they may not even find it worth dealing with. If this happens, that sucks for you and I\u2019m sorry. And you then definitely need a new roommate/living situation. Again, they are a huge ah for even asking for this, let alone demanding it.", "Also I think they need to figure out something where they all stay in her bedroom, especially if it\u2019s more than 1-2 nights. Whether that\u2019s a mattress on the floor that they deflate or tuck under the bed during the day etc. I\u2019ve had housemates for 20 years now through college, residency, fellowship etc and this was ALWAYS the rule in every house.

It really is that simple. \n\nAside from the house rules you guys set up, and not wanting to lose the front room for a month, there are rules by the landlord which could cause you to be evicted. Not allowing your room mate to put your housing in danger doesn't make you an AH. It makes her one for wanting to do it. \n\nYou have every right and reason to say no.
