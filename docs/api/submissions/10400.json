That alone is enough reason to flat out deny them as guests.", "NTA. When you live with another adult - either as roommates or a couple - overnight guests don't get to stay without both of you agreeing in advance, except maybe for one night in a true emergency. Your roommate is being rude and entitled at best, and jeopardizing your housing situation at worst. \n\nI get that these are her parents, and might be willing to overlook it if they were coming in for graduation *weekend*, but no way does she get to invite people to move in to your shared apartment for a month without your voluntary agreement. I get that a graduation is a special event, and I've been to some that might have *felt* like they lasted a month, but since when is it more than a weekend event?  If they can't afford a hotel/AirBnB for a month, they can't afford a month-long trip.", "NTA. \n\nI'd personally try to work something out where they stay on and off. Like a week there, a week in an air bnb if that wouldn't bother you. I'd also check with the leasing office beforehand and let them know the circumstances, graduations are a one time kind thing so they might be very understanding. An entire month+ is definitely pushing it though. \n\nI'd also document everything in case it goes sour so you could present it to your leasing office in the case that she goes ahead and does it anyways, that way you can protect yourself and even possibly get out of a lease with someone that doesn't respect your living boundaries.", "NTA. Tell her you need to talk face to face before you have a meeting with the landlord. She's wildly out of the norm for a roommate request. If you guys had a third bedroom maaaaybe but even then it's really not a reasonable request. She can host her parents like this when she has her own place but not with shared roommates.", "NTA because of the lease. You could get kicked out for that.

It also goes against your agreement with your roommate and means you lose access to the living room (and your privacy) for an entire month. Was she a friend before you became roomies?

It's incredibly disruptive to have house guests for a few days, a whole month is ludicrous.

Life isn\u2019t always about you. The parents haven\u2019t presumably seen their daughter in a long time, have a travel Visa for a rare   Trip (may never happen again). Yes it will be annoying for a month. They should pay OP\u2019s entire rent for the month for the inconvenience. OP should go out a lot, hang out extra with other friends, get more stuff done at work, and/or get a TV on her room - she doesn\u2019t have to entertain them and hang out with them like as if it was her houseguest. Compassion is key here. As suggested above maybe they should take a break in the middle due to the landlord situation. Also everyone is using this as an excuse - no one is getting kicked out here. Rules like this are in place to make sure people don\u2019t end up using the apartment as a permanent dwelling for extra people. If they don\u2019t cook stinky food, And keep a low profile no one but OP will know or care. Landlord would give a fine or warning not just throw them out on the street. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty standard when family comes to see each other from out of the country to stay with relatives.
