That's your guest list. Done. Nobody is allowed to add to or subtract from that list except the two of you by mutual agreement. Nobody else, not for any reason whatsoever, no exceptions, no excuses. \n\nIf your parents and in-laws have a problem with that, they are free to withdraw financial support, and you'll plan your own wedding, with blackjack and hookers, and pay for it yourselves.\n\nI am old. Probably older than your  parents. Everyone's   regret about their own wedding is that they allowed themselves to be pressured into doing it someone else's way, and *especially* that someone else interfered in their guest list. So say no. This is where your married life starts, as a united couple, this is where you draw the line and take control of your own lives.  If you don't stand up his mother  now, she will be all up in your business and slowly destroy your marriage.  \n\nAnd if your fianc\u00e9 can't stand up to his mother, don't marry him.\n\nNTA", "Just repeat the script: \"Unfortunately it is too late to make any alterations to the guest list now that the venue has been booked/invitations have been bought, but we'd love to get together with Aunt Jane's second cousin's father's brother after the wedding.\"\n\nYour fianc\u00e9's parents don't need to be this involved in wedding planning. You gave them plenty of notice to add people and your fianc\u00e9 should now be running interference with their parents. If he's unwilling to do that, then he's perhaps not ready to be married because he's not cut his umbilical cord yet.", "NTA. You and your fianc\u00e9 need to slow down and have a good long talk.  People think that just because they're paying for the wedding that it's THEIR wedding. This money is a GIFT to you two. This doesn't mean they get card blanche to just do whatever they want.\n\nYour guest list should be people one or both of you actually know. This isn't a time to invite people you don't know because they're friends of relatives. This isn't the times to be inviting second and third cousins either. \n\nYou need to wipe the slate clean and start from scratch.  Decide how many people each of you will get to invite.

Sent the original invites out and just tell her you simply don't want to take people away that you care for and replace them with people both you and your fianc\u00e9 don't even know. \nWhat does your fianc\u00e9 say about this?", "Are you an asshole, absolutely not. However, if you take their money, expect to take their crap too. Honestly, you may want to reconsider your wedding plans and plan something you and your fiance can afford. Sometimes the strings attached to money aren't worth it. You may have a beautiful wedding if you accept the money but a lot of your guests will be strangers.", "NTA. Just tell your fianc\u00e9 to tell HIS mother, that he is removing people that he doesn't know. That'll mostly be the people his mom added. He needs to shut it down.", "NTA.  You need to punt this problem to your fiance.  His mother caused this problem and he needs to fix it.", "NTA- this is a power play. Seriously it's not a gee people it's 75!!!!! That's insane. WHO has THAT many people to invite AFTER family and friends of the couple. She's making you sacrifice for her (not your fianc\u00e9, HER). However- this is also not your fight. Your fianc\u00e9 needs to grow a backbone and HE needs to shut it down. \n\n\"Mom, we finalized this guest list months ago. You were asked several times to confirm. You added people then, you don't get to add a second round of people I barely know if I even know them at all. We picked the venue based on this list. We are not making changes now.\"\n\nIf you want to throw her a bone and compromise you can have HIM (again, for most couples each is the primary contact and/or \"bad guy\" to their respective families to make it simpler and harder for the family to \"fight back\") tell her that she can group her 75 in priority tiers and as the RSVPs come back any No's can be replaced by her guests that get later invites.

If you only want to invite people important to you, then you should pay for the wedding. Don\u2019t take her money if you don\u2019t want her to have some control. I also think it is fair for the groom to be able to have the same amount of people on his side as the bride does, especially if his parents are paying for it. Pay for it yourself and you can invite who you like.", "NTA. No way it is your wedding. Yes she is funding it but at the same time people invited by her are people even your fianc\u00e9 don't know. Mind you it is YOUR own wedding.", "NTA! You are correct that it was very inconsiderate of her to add people this late in the game, especially when you gave her ample opportunity earlier. Also, you having a bigger family is not something she needs to \"correct\" on the guest list by bringing in extra friends and extended family just to balance out the sides.\n\nThey might be paying for it, but this is YOUR wedding, not hers. While it might be hard for you, I think you are totally in the right to say \"sorry, but it's too late to change the guest list.\"", "NTA, it's not her wedding.  She's no dummy, she's paying so she can have control over your wedding.  Expect them to offer to pay for other things after the marriage and then watch as she exerts more control in your life.\n\nWhy the hell isn't your fiance telling her to knock this shit off?

Your MIL is really crossing what would usually be considered normal guidelines and boundaries.  It\u2019s too late to do this adding of people. I get that weddings are for families and communities as well as the bridal couple, and you asked the mothers for their lists. All I can suggest is that you have your fianc\u00e9 witness future conversations about numbers and decisions. This will happen again about other things. For now, mail your prepared invites. Remind her that the venue limits numbers but as soon as you hear back from anyone to decline, that spot will be hers to use, and you\u2019ll send the invite, as long as it is not in excess of the max numbers. Maybe she can host a post-wedding gathering for you and your fianc\u00e9 with the more distant friends that you both don\u2019t know. Your fianc\u00e9 needs to get on side with you, and help explain to his mother that you both want to stop adding people now.", "NTA. You are 100 people over on your guest list due solely to MIL late additions. Do your fianc\u00e9 and MIL expect you to disinvite all the people from your side to make those numbers work?", "NTA\n\nTell your MIL this, most people who get invited to weddings where they don't really know the bride and/or groom but were invited by one of the parents, generally do not want to go but feel obligated to accept the invitation. How do I know this? Easy!! My husband and I have received many of these types of invitations and we really did not want to go but we did because the parents would have been insulted. \n\nWhen it comes to inviting people to weddings, there are some that must make it on the list and they are in this order:\n\n1. Witnesses - as in the best man and maid of honor\n\n2. Parents of the bride and groom\n\n3. Siblings\n\n4. Grandparents\n\n5. Aunts, uncles & cousins but only if you have a close relationship with them\n\n6. Close friends\n\n7. Work colleagues\n\n8. Anyone else if there is enough seating\n\n  \nThe idea of inviting people the bride and/or groom have no contact with is ridiculous. This is their day and having to do the pleasantries with people they don't kow or barely know is tedious, boring and time consuming.", "NTA. Tell MIL that you already mailed the invitations and can't adjust your list. Let her know that the new list she gave you will not be taken into consideration because there is no room for them.

This seems to be a power play where she wants her side of the family to be equally represented visually, even if they are not close to your fianc\u00e9 (or MIL for that matter - hence not making the initial cut for her guests).\n\nI think a united front with your fianc\u00e9 is very important.  Sit down and discuss this between just the two of you. Given capacity, I think you must push back either way.  However, how you push back matters - push back full stop and take their money still - but this will require your fianc\u00e9 to stand especially firm.  Or decide not to take their financial help, keep your current list, and then they can pay for a reception with their wider family. Or some other option.

Invites have to go out one by one after each decline comes in until you reach your max capacity. Your fiance has to have this conversation with her because it is their parent and their responsibility to support the decisions you made together.
