We asked both sets of parents (before we booked the venue) to please contribute and add anyone to the guest list that we missed/that they wanted to invite. His mom added some family, and my mom didn\u2019t add anyone, saying that I could choose who I want to come. We ended up with 175 people on our guest list, and the capacity of the venue we chose is 150, but because we have a lot of out of state friends and family that we knew couldn\u2019t make it, we were comfortable with this number. \nOur wedding is in March. I\u2019m working on sending out invites right now, and only have 25 left to do. \n\nA few weeks ago, my fianc\u00e9\u2019s mom informed us that she was going to add people to the guest list, including friends of hers and extended family that my fiance didn\u2019t even recognize by name. I\u2019m feeling quite frustrated because I asked her multiple times to add people and to make sure the numbers on the list were correct before we even booked the venue. I had ordered extra invitations to have just in case, but I had to order more stamps and seals for these extra invites. Our guest list went up to over 250. I am incredibly stressed about this, and I expressed this to my fianc\u00e9\u2019s mom. She told me that she is stressed about it too, and that I need to take people off my list because I have more people invited than my fiance does. This is because my mom has lots of siblings and I have a bigger family than my fiance. We have invited the same number of friends, I just have a bit more family invited than him. \n\nBut now his mom is telling me to take people off my list because that\u2019s what is fair. I am so frustrated, and I\u2019ve tried to trim down my list but can\u2019t take off anyone else without feeling very sad about it, because all of the people I\u2019m inviting are people that are important to me. Meanwhile, my fiance doesn\u2019t even know some of the people his mom added to the list\u2026.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents are funding 90% of our wedding, and thus, I have a much harder time saying no or standing up to his mom\u2026 but I feel like it was so inconsiderate of her to \n1) add so many people MONTHS after the guest list was finalized and venue was booked \n2) add so many people after stationary was ordered \n3) tell me that I need to take people off my list after I already addressed and stamped all their invites and planned to send them out today\n4) tell me I have to take people off when these people are people who I\u2019ve been close to for my whole life, while she has invited friends and extended family that my fiance doesn\u2019t even know.\nAITA?

That's your guest list. Done. Nobody is allowed to add to or subtract from that list except the two of you by mutual agreement. Nobody else, not for any reason whatsoever, no exceptions, no excuses. \n\nIf your parents and in-laws have a problem with that, they are free to withdraw financial support, and you'll plan your own wedding, with blackjack and hookers, and pay for it yourselves.\n\nI am old. Probably older than your  parents. Everyone's   regret about their own wedding is that they allowed themselves to be pressured into doing it someone else's way, and *especially* that someone else interfered in their guest list. So say no. This is where your married life starts, as a united couple, this is where you draw the line and take control of your own lives.  If you don't stand up his mother  now, she will be all up in your business and slowly destroy your marriage.  \n\nAnd if your fianc\u00e9 can't stand up to his mother, don't marry him.\n\nNTA", "Just repeat the script: \"Unfortunately it is too late to make any alterations to the guest list now that the venue has been booked/invitations have been bought, but we'd love to get together with Aunt Jane's second cousin's father's brother after the wedding.\"\n\nYour fianc\u00e9's parents don't need to be this involved in wedding planning. You gave them plenty of notice to add people and your fianc\u00e9 should now be running interference with their parents. If he's unwilling to do that, then he's perhaps not ready to be married because he's not cut his umbilical cord yet.", "NTA. You and your fianc\u00e9 need to slow down and have a good long talk.  People think that just because they're paying for the wedding that it's THEIR wedding. This money is a GIFT to you two. This doesn't mean they get card blanche to just do whatever they want.\n\nYour guest list should be people one or both of you actually know. This isn't a time to invite people you don't know because they're friends of relatives. This isn't the times to be inviting second and third cousins either. \n\nYou need to wipe the slate clean and start from scratch.  Decide how many people each of you will get to invite. Then stop when you reach your allocated number. And if you can't even do that, you have bigger problems ahead of you.", "YTA for this right here.\n\n**We ended up with 175 people on our guest list, and the capacity of the venue we chose is 150,**\u00a0\n\nThen added even more ppl. Now the total is 250. I promise you.... The venue will NOT allow all 250 ppl to go in. They will turn them away at the door. Cut your list down or find another venue.", "NTA. Sent the original invites out and just tell her you simply don't want to take people away that you care for and replace them with people both you and your fianc\u00e9 don't even know. \nWhat does your fianc\u00e9 say about this?", "Are you an asshole, absolutely not. However, if you take their money, expect to take their crap too. Honestly, you may want to reconsider your wedding plans and plan something you and your fiance can afford. Sometimes the strings attached to meny aren't worth it. You may have a beautiful wedding if you accept the money but a lot of your guests will be strangers.", "NTA. Just tell your fianc\u00e9 to tell HIS mother, that he is removing people that he doesn't know. That'll mostly be the people his mom added. He needs to shut it down.", "NTA.  You need to punt this problem to your fiance.  His mother caused this problem and he needs to fix it.", "NTA- this is a power play. Seriously it's not a gee people it's 75!!!!! That's insane. WHO has THAT many people to invite AFTER family and friends of the couple. She's making you sacrifice for her (not your fianc\u00e9, HER). However- this is also not your fight. Your fianc\u00e9 needs to grow a backbone and HE needs to shut it down. \n\n\"Mom, we finalized this guest list months ago. You were asked several times to confirm. You added people then, you don't get to add a second round of people I barely know if I even know them at all. We picked the venue based on this list. We are not making changes now.\"\n\nIf you want to throw her a bone and compromise you can have HIM (again, for most couples each is the primary contact and/or \"bad guy\" to their respective families to make it simpler and harder for the family to \"fight back\") tell her that she can group her 75 in priority tiers and as the RSVPs come back any No's can be replaced by her guests that get later invites. But they are not invited as primary guests.", "NTA\n\nSend the invites and tell her you won\u2019t be uninviting people after already inviting them. \n\nIt\u2019s not your MIL\u2019s social event, it\u2019s YOUR wedding. If the guests don\u2019t know the bride or groom, they shouldn\u2019t be invited let alone taking a spot from an actual invited person.", "YTA - If MOL is paying for 90% of the wedding, she should have some control on the guest list. If you only want to invite people important to you, then you should pay for the wedding. Don\u2019t take her money if you don\u2019t want her to have some control. I also think it is fair for the groom to be able to have the same amount of people on his side as the bride does, especially if his parents are paying for it. Pay for it yourself and you can invite who you like.", "NTA. No way it is your wedding. Yes she is funding it but at the same time people invited by her are people even your fianc\u00e9 don't know. Mind you it is YOUR own wedding.", "NTA! You are correct that it was very inconsiderate of her to add people this late in the game, especially when you gave her ample opportunity earlier. Also, you having a bigger family is not something she needs to \"correct\" on the guest list by bringing in extra friends and extended family just to balance out the sides.\n\nThey might be paying for it, but this is YOUR wedding, not hers. While it might be hard for you, I think you are totally in the right to say \"sorry, but it's too late to change the guest list.\"", "NTA, it's not her wedding.  She's no dummy, she's paying so she can have control over your wedding.  Expect them to offer to pay for other things after the marriage and then watch as she exerts more control in your life.\n\nWhy the hell isn't your fiance telling her to knock this shit off?  It's absolutely his responsibility.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Your MIL is really crossing what would usually be considered normal guidelines and boundaries.  It\u2019s too late to do this adding of people. I get that weddings are for families and communities as well as the bridal couple, and you asked the mothers for their lists. All I can suggest is that you have your fianc\u00e9 witness future conversations about numbers and decisions. This will happen again about other things. For now, mail your prepared invites. Remind her that the venue limits numbers but as soon as you hear back from anyone to decline, that spot will be hers to use, and you\u2019ll send the invite, as long as it is not in excess of the max numbers. Maybe she can host a post-wedding gathering for you and your fianc\u00e9 with the more distant friends that you both don\u2019t know. Your fianc\u00e9 needs to get on side with you, and help explain to his mother that you both want to stop adding people now.", "NTA. You are 100 people over on your guest list due solely to MIL late additions. Do your fianc\u00e9 and MIL expect you to disinvite all the people from your side to make those numbers work?", "NTA\n\nTell your MIL this, most people who get invited to weddings where they don't really know the bride and/or groom but were invited by one of the parents, generally do not want to go but feel obligated to accept the invitation. How do I know this? Easy!! My husband and I have received many of these types of invitations and we really did not want to go but we did because the parents would have been insulted. \n\nWhen it comes to inviting people to weddings, there are some that must make it on the list and they are in this order:\n\n1. Witnesses - as in the best man and maid of honor\n\n2. Parents of the bride and groom\n\n3. Siblings\n\n4. Grandparents\n\n5. Aunts, uncles & cousins but only if you have a close relationship with them\n\n6. Close friends\n\n7. Work colleagues\n\n8. Anyone else if there is enough seating\n\n  \nThe idea of inviting people the bride and/or groom have no contact with is ridiculous. This is their day and having to do the pleasantries with people they don't kow or barely know is tedious, boring and time consuming.", "NTA. Tell MIL that you already mailed the invitations and can't adjust your list. Let her know that the new list she gave you will not be taken into consideration because there is no room for them. Suggest that she hold a reception after the honeymoon for her additional guests to meet the bride and groom.", "This! When my brother got married, his FMIL was a nightmare, they were paying for most of it so the wedding and guest list was pretty much what and who FMIL wanted. \n\nSpeaking to my brother and SIL a few later, with my husband. We were saying how we loved our wedding, it was everything we wanted, with a great guest list (including some old friends of my and my husband's parents). My brother and SIL looked at each other and said if they had their time again, they would have eloped - it had been so stressful and ended up not really being what they wanted.", "YTA for not reading this carefully. First of all, amongst the 175 invites includes those that her fiancee's mother invited originally. Not all are invited by her. She also explained **but because we have a lot of out of state friends and family that we knew couldn\u2019t make it, we were comfortable with this number.** Second of all OP is not the person who added the extra people to make the list to 250, her fiancee's mother is the one.", "Did you read the sentence after that? I said that we have a lot of out of state friends and family, and we know for sure that at least 30% won\u2019t come. And it wasn\u2019t my choice to add anyone else after that.", "Good idea. \u201cMom, we are cutting out the people either I or she don\u2019t recognize.\u201d", ">  My brother and SIL looked at each other and said if they had their time again, they would have eloped - it had been so stressful and ended up not really being what they wanted.\n\nThere it is.", "minus 30% is still more than 150. Yes. I read it just fine. What is she going to do when all of a sudden only 10% does not show up?", "minus 30% is still over 150 total.", "We had gotten definite \u201cno\u2019s\u201d from over 15 people before even finalizing the list (extenuating circumstances/travel expenses), so we weren\u2019t worried about this. The people who said no asked for us to send invites anyway because it was important to them still.", "70% of 175 is 123. With our original numbers, we had over 25 people of leeway.", "I get that. I keep all my invites. They are special to me too. Good luck with the wedding. Congrats on finding your one!!!", "\u00a0**Our guest list went up to over 250**.\u00a0Did you remember putting in this sentence? You are not working with 175 anymore. 250 minus 30% is 175. That is still over the venue capacity.", "I know, and that\u2019s why I made this post. I\u2019m worried about how many people are on the guest list now, after my FMIL added the people that made the guest list over 250, and wanted to ask to see if I\u2019m in the wrong before proceeding with telling my FMIL that we can\u2019t add that many people to the list.", "Oh my goodness\u2026 that\u2019s the entire reason for the post! 250 is way too much and OP is being told the reduction has to come from her invites of people closer to her than the additional 75 people her MIL invited last minute.", "\u00a0**I have a much harder time saying no or standing up to his mom\u2026 but I feel like it was so inconsiderate of her to**\n\nThis was the final question or statement. Yes, it makes her a VERY SLIGHT AH for not standing up to the MIL just because she is funding it. NOW.... its very out of control."]}
