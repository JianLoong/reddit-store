I\u2019ve seen this in AITA a few times. Some people get it confused. \n\n  It\u2019s kinda like co-signing a loan. Doesn\u2019t mean the person doesn\u2019t pay the loan. You\u2019re just the back up. \n\nYou just do it because you want your marriage to have a chance in the same country. It\u2019s not a favor.
