Your mother clearly has some major issues.\n\nNTA, you don't have to respond to abuse, actually it's better that you don't.\n\nHave you ever seen crabs in a bucket? If one starts climbing out, the others pull it back down. Your mum seems jealous that you've made better decisions than she did, and wants to drag you down to her level. Parents are supposed to want better for their kids than they had, and she clearly doesn't. It's like she wants you to be as miserable as she is.\n\nKeep on your path, live a wonderful life, and remember that sometimes living well is the best revenge.

You have a right to protect your mental and emotional health, and if your mother's text caused you distress, then leaving her on read sounds like a reasonable thing to do.  \nConsider whether you are getting any benefits from maintaining contact with your mother, and if not, consider going no-contact for your own wellbeing.", "This isn\u2019t going to affect my NTA judgment, but is there a reason you can\u2019t go NC?
