When I said that, he decided to switch to the ticket topic. I unfortunately was not able to get tickets for the show, as so many others.

Tis great-uncle had already promised to take me to the show and even take me on a tour through the town, since I've never been there. Now, my uncle and this great-uncle do not have the best relationship because of opposing political views) When he found out that I would not be attending the concert, his (my uncle) reaction was to clap his hands and say \"Thank God\".

He came into my room, and tried to hug me. I dodged, moving away and said I did not want to talk or hug since I am still upset about what honestly was just the breaking point after what feels like a long time of being belittled. As soon as I reacted that way, his demeanor, that looked friendly before, completely changed. He was furious and said that the moment he left my room I would no longer have an uncle. He left, and slammed the front door as he did so. \n\nMy mother and grandmother are on his side saying I should apologize for not wanting to talk to him and pretend everything is fine.

He probably has this problem with a lot of people and figured since you were family you would have to put up with it.

Picks on his niece for fun and doesn\u2019t like it when there are repercussions to his shitty behaviour. Your mother and grandmother are enabling his crappy behaviour. I guess we know why he got to this age without becoming a decent human being. \n\nHold your ground. You don\u2019t need to hug anyone you don\u2019t want to or share any info with mean uncles. If he tries to tell you it was all a joke, ask him to please explain the joke. Also you can explain the concept that it\u2019s only funny if EVERYONE is laughing.", "NTA.\n\n>I (21F) have an uncle (45M) that has always made fun of most of the things I like.\n\nI didn't need any more than this. He can either try to get on with you or shut up. The rest of your post confirms it.", "NTA\n\nYou do not owe anyone hugs if you do not want to give them. No one is entitled to touch your body without your consent. I am sorry your bodily autonomy is not being supported by your family.", "NTA he weirdly overreacted to you not wanting to hug him or talk to him after he kept insulting you.\n\nCould you have dealt with his comments better? Yes. Running out whilst say you hate your family isn't exactly mature. However, I understand what it's like to be belittled by family and I think you are in the right about not wanting to be \"buddy-buddy\" with him atm. He needs to apologise for how he has spoken to you.", "NTA He's a jerk and finally got called out.  It's concerning how quickly he got so angry that it's unstable behavior.  I'd keep some distance from him. He sounds creepy, especially coming in for a hug and tracking you down in your room.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d rather have no uncle than a bully who demands hugs and then acts like a petulant child when he doesn\u2019t get them.\n\nYou don\u2019t owe him hugs. You don\u2019t owe him silence when he belittles you. After a lifetime of putting up with this, you don\u2019t owe him anything.", "NTA    he needs to be reminded that if you don't have anything positive to say, don't say anything. I would completely ignore him, if you have to be in the same place as him.", "NTA. Your uncle doesn't get to be a bully and then decide that he wants a hug from you. Your mom and grandma want you to apologize probably so he can stop sulking to them and so things can go back to \"normal\" which is him being a bully and you not saying anything in order to \"keep the peace\". You're NTA, your uncle, mom and grandma are. They should be standing up for you instead of trying to get you to apologize to him.", "NTA\n\nOn a similar note, I used to have a friend who hated ABBA. Which is fine, not everyone likes everything. Except any time I'd mention them, the friend would proceed to go on and on about how much he hated them. One say, I shared a post on my instagram story about the possibility of a Mama Mia 3\n\nHe commented on my instagram story, and I responded with something completely different - totally ignoring what he'd said. He asked *\"Oh you can't take a little Abba teasing?\"* to which I responded *\"Why would I want to talk about something that makes me happy, when you're only going to insult them?\"*\n\nHe never messaged me again. \n\nSome people honestly think shitting all over things is a funny personality trait and hate being reminded they're just...being assholes. \n\nHonestly I'd just start responding to your uncles comments with honesty. \n\n*\"Well... that was rude\"* \n\n*\"You know X makes me happy, why would you say that to me?\"*\n\n*\"Were you intentionally trying to hurt me when you said that?\"* \n\n*\"What a weird thing to say to someone, who enjoys their music\"* \n\n*\"Sorry for confusing you, I'm not forcing you to listen to her music\"*", "NTA\n\nYour uncle sounds like a massive AH.\n\nFor the record, I say that as an aunt. Like, I'm so much an aunt that I'm practically a professional, hahaha. I have a handful of nieces and nephews (including two around your age), and literally like a DOZEN of other kids around the world, the children of my friends, who call me \"Auntie\" (not because they have to but because they want to). \n\nThose kids are all MY LIFE. They have a zillion different interests, some that I think are cool, others not so much, but I could not care less . . . if they love something, then I want to know about it. I want to sit on the floor with them and listen to them go on and on about their favourite book, or video game, or singer. I want to know why those things make them happy, because I love seeing them happy. \n\nAnd that is what an aunt or uncle should be - someone who lifts you up, listens to you, makes you feel special and heard and seen. Not ever someone who makes fun of you (unless it is the gentle kind of teasing where you are laughing as hard as they are, and they are also making fun of themselves, like when I tell my nieces, \"OMG you are just like me, and we are both ridiculous!\").\n\nYou are NTA.
