At the same time, I wouldn't make it a habit of letting EVERY stranger know your business, fake or not.

The problem with a comment like that is the risk of the kids overhearing or comments being repeated to them. It is amazing how often kids succeed in sneaking up on an adult - if not your kids, then one of their friends. Sometimes people can be having conversations, when the background noise drops suddenly and a private conversation might as well have been shouted. Plus, with a stranger so rude as to question the location of their mom, you'd be risking the intrusive stranger offering the kids condolences for their loss.\n\nThere were a number of other options to you, the obvious one being 'I don't discuss it with strangers'.

Most times, they didn't want to look like a complete ass, so they would say something like you look so young. I would put on a big smile and say \"why thank you.\" They pretty much let any questions or conversation die at that point cause they didn't expect my response and therefore generally didn't know what to say after that. \nJust answer their question with a question.

For one thing, your kids could've overheard, and you don't want them either believing their mother's dead or thinking it's okay to tell people she is. For another, people probably aren't judging you as much as you think. If anything, most people are likely sympathetic to the difficulties a young single parent faces. And those that do get judgy? You can tell those politely to leave you alone.", "YTA. The other guy was being nosy and sexist, but nothing you shared sounds like he was being judgemental about your age.

So, I used to make up crazy ass stories because I was tired of it - including but not limited to tragic losses. You just get so tired of it and invasive questions grate on your nerves.

They had their last child at 36 and the were considered VERY old to be parents. This was the 80s and 90s.
