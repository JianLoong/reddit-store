In Scotland it is completely expected that you go bear arse unless it's a rental. However we also only really wear kilts at formal events or national sporting events. \n\nFun fact, the reason why you go naked underneath is because back in the day, our men faught completely naked for ease of moment and when the full kilt was added it was just added onto the naked body. \n\nThe only thing I'd say is in Scotland we don't focus on DNA, heritage or race etc, we focus on nationality, if you make Scotland your home, you are Scottish, even if you only make it your home for a week. Everyone welcome but absolutely no discrimination of anyone for choosing to embrace our amazing country.", "Came here to say this. Exceptionally inappropriate behavior from bridesmaid.

He has the right to go out and not have his kilt pulled up in public, whether he was wearing underwear or not that is entirely on the other person who shouldn't have touched him in the first place.\n\nI'm Scottish and so see men in kilts at most functions, as well as nights out and gigs.

I\u2019m glad he did! We used part of his tartan that was wrecked during the reception to cover our wedding scrapbook.  His family has been in Canada for 4 generations now but they visit \u2018the old country\u2019 when they can.

Asking genuinely because I remember reading about the no underwear thing when I was a kid, going \"huh interesting\" and this literally never occurred to me since, to be creepy and fixated on it. But now I'm seeing posts like this as if it's a common, normalized thing and I'm just....appalled? Like that's so obviously sexual assault, if a man yelled \"are you wearing panties??\" and grabbed at a woman's genitals and flashed her to everyone there would be jail time, this seems heinous to me.", "OMG a Scotsman reference.

It\u2019s just basic decency to wear underwear in public. At the very least when you wear something like a skirt or kilt that can be lifted either by wind or hands. \n\nI would Never say anyone groping or lifting cloths with out permission of the person wearing them wasn\u2019t a colossal asshole and guilty of sexual assault, because that\u2019s what it is.", "Read the second part. \n\nI explicitly say I do Not condone what she did.", "Being decent in public is really not much to ask imo.", "I was going to say the same thing.
