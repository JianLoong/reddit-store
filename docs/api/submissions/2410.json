The bridesmaid is completely at fault. \n\n\n\n\nFyi- because my spouse & I are severe history geeks, I'm going to point out a couple of facts to give background abt kilt wearing from the ole days.\n\n\n\n1) The men didn't wear underwear under kilts because NO ONE wore underwear until starting in the 1800s and slowly altered due to customs.  (That wasn't just Scotland, it was all over Western Europe).Underwear for women... well that was a shift in worldview.   Look it up. \n\n\n\n2) Men always wore very long shirts which hit around knees. Its what theyd sleep in.   The kilt was wrapped around it.  Many times, they tied up those shirts between their legs so they wouldn't go flapping around and getting wet or caught up.  So they didn't really let it all hang in the breeze as everyone today likes to think. \n\n\n\n3) The modern kilt is shorter & has less material in comparison to pre-1900s.  This brushing the knees would be positively scandalous and pretty much useless for original purpose.  \"Rob Roy\" w Liam Neeson has a lot of excellent examples of traditional wear. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I was a kid, my parents took me to Scotland in the late 1970s. I remember watching a parade of a Highland regiment. An old lady started picking on one of the young men and trying to lift his kilt.  \n\n\nI remember some of the (much) older Scottish men in the crowd next to me, laughing & cheering the \"Laddie\" who was stupid (in their perspective)  to not have his xxx on for a public event. Apparently there were always the older local ladies around to put them in their place by reminding them to have \"proper attire\".  My parents were talking w them afterwards.   \n\n\n[I don't know the word they were using.  Could have been 'braes', but might not). \n\n\n\n\nWith an event with alcohol and stupid people, just wear underwear under the kilt if you wear it again.   It was her fault entirely.   But the people around really didn't need to see you in that light. You're not at fault. But in modern society,  there's an expectation of underwear, especially for special occasions.", "NTA\nEveryone should know that lifting up a person\u2019s kilt/skirt against their will is a disgusting thing to do. \n\nThat\u2019s on her not you.

She says she\u2019s heard what\u2019s under there and asks if it\u2019s true, so he gives her permission to slide a hand up and check. She does, then pulls her hand back and says:\n\n\u201cWhy sir that\u2019s gruesome\u201d \n\nand he then lets out a roar,\n\n\u201cIf you slide your hand up once again, \n\nYou\u2019ll find it\u2019s grew some more!\u201d\u2019", "You're supposed to put it in the foot hole, not the tiny air holes!", "I was looking for this but now I feel old", "\\+100 I came here to say this very thing.", "*justin Timberlake has entered the chat* \n\nNTA OP", "Apparently she never heard the term \"going regimental?\"", "It's an unfortunate double standard that as men we're supposed to just laugh it off in such circumstances. \"Oh it's only a joke\", \"they were just having fun\" or the big daddy \"most men would be glad of the attention\", yet anyone saying that to a woman who had unwanted sexual attention would be crucified.", "I have extremely mixed feelings about the \"if the genders were reversed\" thing, because it's only necessary to use when you're talking to someone who doesn't naturally respect people's rights regardless of gender, and I don't *want* to be talking to anyone like that. I shouldn't have to make you visualise me as a different gender for you to realise I have a right not to be harassed.

I can't say I've ever verified it up close or personal, but I know he was known for doing the highland fling and don't recall seeing more than the kilt going flying.", "There was a bit on The Graham Norton show where they had to find the true Scotsman.

Even the big stuff will be met with a \"you should be flattered\" if a woman is conventionally \"unattractive,\" especially if she's fat. Depending on where she is, a woman might even be shamed for not wearing underwear in this situation. However, I do think there is in general a stronger understanding of how wrong this behavior is when it's a man doing it to a woman.\n\nAll the same, I (a conventionally attractive woman) was sexually assaulted in a room full of supposed \"friends\" as a teenager and they *all laughed at me* when I got mad about it. so. nobody's *really* safe.", "That is a *great* line.
