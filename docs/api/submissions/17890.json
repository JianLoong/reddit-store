She needs to send an email follow-up to the person(s) she has informed of her pregnancy like: \"Following up on our discussion on [Month, day, year], I told you that I was x months pregnant; shortly thereafter, I was removed from project X and told to train my replacement. I plan on working until I deliver, then return quickly after I have recovered. As per [law], it is illegal to discriminate against pregnant women. I hope that my pregnancy will not interfere with the promotion that I was told would take effect in [month, year]. Please do not spread rumors of my pregnancy, that is private and I will announce it on my terms within the timeframe given by company policy. Further, I would appreciate being reinstated to work on project X; I can take a smaller role in the project when my due date is nearing, but please do not deprive me of the credit and experience I gain from the work I have already done on project X.\"\n\nYour friend needs a paper trail proving she disclosed her pregnancy ASAP. Since there is no proof she shared that info with the company, they can demote, pass her up for promotion, or fire her as soon as the replacement is trained. Since I don't know where you live, I don't know what laws you have protecting pregnancy in the workplace, that's why it says \"[law].\"\n\n If she can access one, I'd say go to an employment lawyer for advice since they immediately reacted by removing her from a project and asking her to train a replacement. Otherwise, still do the paper trail with the email and then immediately contact HR.

But if you want to be a good friend you should help her look into ways to stop this. This type of shitty workplace misogyny can\u2019t be allowed to play out.

It shouldn\u2019t be expected of a pregnant woman to hide her pregnancy for 7 months. Telling your friend to do this & then saying \u201cI told you so\u201d when she didn\u2019t, is really rude.

Nobody does that with well intentions, it is solely used to gloat. There could be numerous logical reasons she decided to tell her supervisor and even if she had no real reason, who cares? It was her decision, not yours and she doesnt deserve to be discriminated against for it and on top of that to have her own friend rub it in her face.

No one is hiding a pregnancy for 7 months - aside from the big bump it can come with health issues like nausea, and some risks which need to be navigated for example she won't be able to lift anything.

They're discriminating against her on the basis of maternity/pregnancy", "It doesn't actually say that the friend asked for advise the first time, just that OP warned her against saying anything at work and hiding her pregnancy until she was at 7 months... and honestly,  what kind of advise is that?!

When I recently announsed my first pregnancy, the reply from pretty much everyone (including my boss) was \"Yeah, obviously!\" or some variation of that... I also got lots of congratulations of course, but my point is that pretty much everyone I was in regular contact with had figured out that I was pregnant before I told them.", "Her friend got the advice then proceeded not to listen. Why would you give further advice to someone who ain't gonna listen?", "It doesn't say that she asked the first time though...", ">What pregnant woman can hide her pregnancy for 7 months?\n\nI know a woman who didn't even know herself that she was pregnant until the eighth month, so that is entirely possible.\n\nAlso she could have waited to tell til after the promotion, which doesn't necessarily mean 7th month.", "If an employee was simply leaving in a few months, would you assign them to long-term projects?  \n\nYes, pregnant women have rights but I don't see why a company should have to shoot itself in the foot and ignore that she's leaving for a year.", "A terrible thing to say but true.

There is absolutely no way I could have hidden my pregnancy past about month 3 unless I pretended I had a tumour or something.\n\nBut that really isn't the point.

Have you seen a pregnant woman ?", "A friend of my dads found out 2wks before she gave birth and that was only because she tested after my dad looked at her and said \"your pregnant\" he didn't know why he said it or what was different about her, he just knew.\n\nMy hubby held off on telling his employers I was pregnant because he knew he was coming up to negotiations for switching to full-time with a salary. The only reason he had to tell them earlier was because I had started fainting. They were all shocked at the xmas party when they asked how long I had left, and I told them I was a week late. They all claimed I was too small to be overdue.\n\nI say NTA, OP warned her on what could happen and she failed to take OPs advice to heart, why would OP both wasting time giving a device to someone who hasn't listened in the past."]}
