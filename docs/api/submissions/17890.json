She needs to send an email follow-up to the person(s) she has informed of her pregnancy like: \"Following up on our discussion on [Month, day, year], I told you that I was x months pregnant; shortly thereafter, I was removed from project X and told to train my replacement. I plan on working until I deliver, then return quickly after I have recovered. As per [law], it is illegal to discriminate against pregnant women. I hope that my pregnancy will not interfere with the promotion that I was told would take effect in [month, year]. Please do not spread rumors of my pregnancy, that is private and I will announce it on my terms within the timeframe given by company policy. Further, I would appreciate being reinstated to work on project X; I can take a smaller role in the project when my due date is nearing, but please do not deprive me of the credit and experience I gain from the work I have already done on project X.\"\n\nYour friend needs a paper trail proving she disclosed her pregnancy ASAP. Since there is no proof she shared that info with the company, they can demote, pass her up for promotion, or fire her as soon as the replacement is trained. Since I don't know where you live, I don't know what laws you have protecting pregnancy in the workplace, that's why it says \"[law].\"\n\n If she can access one, I'd say go to an employment lawyer for advice since they immediately reacted by removing her from a project and asking her to train a replacement. Otherwise, still do the paper trail with the email and then immediately contact HR. The company is already preparing to get rid of her, she needs to move fast.\n\n* **Edit: I'm sorry for assuming that this was happening in the US. Unfortunately my knowledge only really encompasses US laws. Hopefully the new law OP mentioned in their edit passes soon! Their friend might be out of luck UNLESS their company has policies that protect pregnancy more than the country's current laws do. OP, it would be worth having your friend reach out to their company's HR department and ask what their policy is surrounding pregnancy and staying in / returning to work, and proceed from there. If the company has it's own policy about pregnancy, your friend might still be a little bit protected.

Advice given should be given freely to help the person,  not because you need them to see that you are right, or were right. You should respect people\u2019s choices that you care about and the right to make their own decisions and own mistakes, even if you tried to guide them otherwise and their choice is different than you would have made. And you\u2019re not required to give advice, but it shouldn\u2019t be because you are worried someone won\u2019t do as you advise.

Just that discrimination against pregnant women is illegal in a lot of countries doesn't mean discrimination doesn't happen in those countries. In a lot of (Western) countries women and men still aren't treated equally, in the workplace and beyond, even with good laws in place. Sadly laws don't stop people from discriminating against others. I think a lot of minority groups can tell you that. And what about negative effects caused by implicit bias? A lot of well meaning people with good intentions are unaware of their bias and the (often subtle) discrimination deriving from it. Those are also harder to prove.\n\nIn OP's friend's case the discrimination is quite explicit, so if she wants and has the energy for it she probably can fight it. But standing up for her rights could probably cost her the good relationship with her supervisor and boss. Is this fair? No. But it's very likely her reality.\n\nI agree with OP it would've been easier for her friend to not tell her supervisor and boss before it was legally necessary or before her pregnancy was really, really obvious. Or after her promotion. That doesn't mean I think discrimination against pregnant women is okay, but sadly it's part of the world we live in.

It is not your friends' responsibility to listen to all your problems and vice versa; maybe some venting they're ok with over others, maybe they really aren't in the mindset to be listening to other people's problems at all and they need to concentrate on their own shit. If you care about someone enough you would make sure they are ok with you venting to them and respect if they don't want to listen to you rant about your problems at that moment or ever. \n\nLook if that's a standard for a friend for you then you have every right to that, but how I see it only certain friends are truly \"rant friends\"; friends you can rant to and you can listen to rant.

Sometimes in life you're not gonna have anyone to vent to about certain problems. In this scenario, the OP just doesn't want to listen to this rant. They probably did not want to hear this rant in the first place, which is why they gave the unsolicited advice that they did so not only to help out but to avoid potentially months of ranting about this. If OP doesn't wanna listen they don't have to, and if their friend is struggling with that and doesn't have someone to rant to herself (where's the baby daddy? That should be your #1 person to vent to is your significant other) Then she should look into some therapy for awhile, therapy doesn't have to be a permanent thing. If she's struggling with this it would probably be helpful to talk to a professional about her feelings and what to do about them especially since she's pregnant. \n\nTL;DR: Friends are more than just people to vent to, they are not obligated to listen to our problems if they don't want to and there's more to friendship than that.", "At least you won't ever see her again.
