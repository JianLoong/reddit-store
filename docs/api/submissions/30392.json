She is not a guest.\n\nSo technically no children as guests is still the case.\n\nChild free wedding or not is usually controversial. \n\nMaybe this idea would help: I hired a babysitter for the ceremony and for the reception.\n\nParents who wanted to, could put their children in the room at the church (it had things for kids to do.) Frankly kids are bored during weddings anyway.\n\nAt the reception, there was a side room and the kids got a kid's meal and they each got a gift bag with toys in it, age appropriate, with their name on the bag.  \n\n\nIt worked very well.  \n\n\nThere was still a mishap. One set of parents allowed their about 9 or 10 year old (maybe younger, not sure) to drink eleven sodas. Yes. Eleven. He got sugared up and ran in circles on the dance floor -- and he tripped an elderly woman who hit her head. She was okay but I was mortified.  \n\n\nI went to the parents, smiling, saying I hope he is okay. The did not apologize to anyone, even to the older lady who fell because of their child running into her. They should've pulled him off the dance floor because this was obviously about to happen.  \n\n\nThere was a separate child's room exactly for that reason. But note, I never told anyone they had to go there. The parents mostly enjoyed having that break to enjoy the reception.

Yes, an older child that won't scream and cry and need to be bottle fed, but she's still a child, and people will be questioning how you can say you're having a child-free wedding but then invite Flower.
