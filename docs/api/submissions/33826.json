Protect your young'uns. Methadone is legal heroin substitution, to help heroin addicts come down legally. Holy heck, u/zealousidealsweet979, #1: your kid gets into that medication: ***NO*** good results. #2: school finds the medication: kid gets suspended, everyone gets in trouble.

Your BIL could very well relapse and for that reason he is not a safe person to be around your kids.\n\nI would suggest marital or family counseling if you think this really could end your marriage. Your husband needs to see beyond his relationship with his family and realize you are looking out for the safety of your kids.", "NTA.

Do not let your husband strong arm you this is serious and you should take it as such if your child had ingested that the result would\u2019ve been fatal.

Did you ask your son how it got in there?  So many questions to have had to ask before flying off the handle accusing your IL's and denying them access.  And really why did you all of a sudden decide to check the backpack anyway?

Removing my child from being in their care without my supervision is the least I would do.\n\nETA: methadone was mixed with OJ and left in the fridge by a grandparent who was staying with auntie. child protective services got involved and opened investigations into both the auntie whose house the ingestion happened at, as well as my SIL who left my nephew there while she was at work. They were threatened with having the kids removed from both homes. The health authority responsible for the methadone program and police also opened an investigation into why the methadone was not being consumed immediately after it was dispensed for concerns of narcotic diversion and distribution.
