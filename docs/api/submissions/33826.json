And it shouldn't have been able to happen anyway, because he should be consuming it at the pharmacy immediately after it is handed to him. \n\nA couple people have mentioned that there is a possibility your BIL was using your child's urine (which would be clean) to get the methadone- if your child is old enough to have a conversation about that, I'd absolutely have it. There's zero reason to take the child to the pharmacy every day, at least zero good ones. \n\nI would also certainly sit husband down with the pediatrician and have the doc give him a rundown of what would have happened if your child ingested it. Or what would have happened if your child brought it to school and *a different child* ingested it- including criminal charges.\n\nIf it were me, I'd also preemptively call the school and explain- this is BIL's medication, legally prescribed, but *just in case your kid ever got his hands on it*, because your husband doesn't seem to understand how big a deal it is, you'd like to set up a meeting so someone in the school admin can explain to you both the steps that they would legally have to take, should your child be found to have methadone.\n\nBtw, that would include calls to the police, the pharmacy, CPS, social services... And your children would almost certainly be taken away (at least for a while, if not permanently).

That said, an addict is an addict- and in my experience, any addict who denies that they will always be an addict (even if they haven't partaken in years) does not have the mental and physical fortitude to kick their habit, whatever the habit is. \n\nAn alcoholic who hasn't had a drink in 20 years is still an alcoholic.

You are protecting your children.  \n\n**Has MIL/BIL explained how BIL's meds got into your child's bag?  Have they shown any regret or remorse or any sign that they realize that what happened was very very wrong?** \n\nIf it's a daily pick up and was in your child's bag, does that mean BIL didn't notice he hadn't taken it?  \n\n**Allowing such things around children isn't safe for the children.**\n\n*My husband and MIL make me feel like I'm being horrible and awkward not letting my children go to her house and it's destroying my marriage and my mental health.*\n\n**They are wrong.  You are the only sane adult in this situation, that is trying to protect the kids.** \n\nIf your husband is willing to destroy your marriage because you refuse to allow your children to be put at risk again, then there is something deeply wrong with him.  \n\nThere's nothing to show any change in MIL's behaviors, nothing to prove to you that she won't put your children at risk again.  All they are telling you is that BIL is fine now.  But that wasn't the only problem.  The problem is that MIL didn't bother telling you things that a parent needs to know, to protect the children.  **And she put the kids at risk,** to the point they brought this thing home. \n\nNTA.  But talk to someone with legal authority about how to protect your kids, whatever you need to do here.  I think you need some paper trails, to show that the reason you cannot let MIL have the kids is because of her lack of proper safety for them. \n\n**This isn't about what your MIL wants.**\n\n**It's about what your children need.**  \n\nI hope your husband will wake up and see this.", "Did you happen to take a picture of the prescription you found in your child's backpack?                            I would sit down and document anything you can think of, in regard to your BIL and/or MIL and any proof that they are people that should not be around your children.\n\nGo speak to a lawyer. \n\nGet your finances sorted (separate your accounts if you can).\n\nThen speak to someone at a Domestic Violence Center to help you plan an EXIT Strategy.\n\nGood Luck.", "NTA\u2026I would die on this hill.", "Being around a methadone user (and methadone) is not in itself dangerous, especially as the addict is in active recovery.  However, being around unsecured methadone IS quite dangerous.\n\nAround here at least, methadone treatment means you go to a clinic to get dispensed one dose to be taken on the premises -- which prevents the scenario ever happening.  \n\n\nI'd suggest a sitdown discussion with family members.  All prescribed drugs to go immediately into drug lock boxes that children cannot access.", "Oh shit.  That could be it.  But regardless, children cannot be allowed to be unsupervised in a place where dangerous substances are not safely stored.  Doesn\u2019t matter whether it is methadone or another controlled or regulated substance.  I agree it is possible that the husband\u2019s perception of what is normal is different because of how he was raised.  He may think, well, I knew not to touch that stuff when I was a kid and nothing ever happened, so it\u2019s okay.  But it\u2019s not.  Kids die from unknowingly consuming drugs all too often.  Pills look like candy to them.  And they certainly wouldn\u2019t understand the risk even if they know they are drugs.", "I'm so curious as to where in the world OP is, because here in the UK, I'm pretty sure most methadone is only dispensed on site, and pharmacists have to witness it being being ingested to prevent it being sold on. I can't imagine a pharmacy here dispensing whole 100ml bottles to take away except in incredibly exceptional circumstances.", "I'm a little afraid to google it, so may I ask what happens when a child ingests methadone?", "Even if it was child, the child should never ever have access to it. And they should have noticed it was missing.\n\nChild with access to methadone is in much higher chance of being accidentally poisoned or accidentally getting into large trouble in school then child without access to it. And caregiver adults are responsible for preventing access.", "Not with full custody and a restraining order against (hopefully soon-to-be ex) husband, MIL and BIL for extreme child endangerment.", "I imagine that this incident would be front and center during the custody hearings and OP would lobby for heavily limited access anyway possible", "I kind of doubt it would be because from my understanding they're looking to see that the medication is actually in your system as well as if you have other substances in your system.\n\nFrom people who are in formal pain management I learned that they actually look to see that not only are you taking it but that you're taking it in the amount you're prescribed (generally). I don't doubt that they do the same thing with street drug level addicts and recovery. \n\nBut if they are then the cops need to be called in fact I would have called the cops as soon as I found it in the bag..  But I am pretty protective.", "Yes it can be dispensed in the UK depending on the patient and how the doctor chooses to write the prescription. It is also normal for patients to get Sundays dose home on a Saturday as pharmacys are closed on Sundays. Also they would get holiday doses in advance.", "That\u2019s what happens here too and why an investigation was opened into why the methadone wasn\u2019t consumed when it was dispensed.", "Severe drowsiness and extremely low heart rate. The cardiac effects is what they were most concerned about with my nephew. Narcanned him multiple times obviously.", "Extremely, extremely dangerous for children to be able to access methadone. It's like saying \"oops, sorry, your child took my heroin from the cabinet whilst I wasn't looking\". \n\nIt's the medicine doctors prescribe (in the UK, at least), when someone is trying to get clean from heroin/opiates.", "I hope like hell she\u2019d get it this is gross neglect. But I\u2019d start by asking a lawyer what my chances are because family court can be odd.", "Yeah agreed. The kid\u2019s urine would be too \u2018clean\u2019", "Ah interesting to know. My anecdata is probably heavily skewed by being in Glasgow, where very few patients would be allowed home dispensing. Never worked in a pharmacy, but years ago I was a GP receptionist, and I remember methadone dispensing being a huge rigmarole for young men particularly, as they tended to get casual construction work that took them out of the city from very early in the morning, and this away from their dispensing pharmacy.", "That's why I also posted in another comment that she needs to report it.", "Actually this is also my knowledge and experience of Glasgow, Scotland. I am from a family of health workers and friends who are (doctors, pharmacist, nurses). It is very much different on a case to case basis, depending on the actual patient and the prescribing doctor.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that England may have different rules though."]}
