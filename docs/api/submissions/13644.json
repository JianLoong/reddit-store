He always had this running joke that he had an identical twin brother, Kayden, who looked just like him. He told us funny stories about him, that were obviously jokes. He even showed us pictures of them together, that looked photoshopped. His supposed twin brother looked just like him, except his hair was styled differently. I enjoyed the Kayden jokes and joined in on them acting like I believe Kayden actually exists, because it was funny.\n\nYesterday Jayden asked to meet me.

He might not get to keep his hand or even if he does, he definitely won't be able to use it like before. \n\nI was really confused, the Kayden jokes were never this grim and Jayden looked actually sad. I told Jayden that this was a bit too far and I didn't find it funny. Jayden kept pretending that Kayden is an actual person and is in the hospital and I told him I don't believe him, I never did believe Kayden was a real person and he should stop joking about it, because it's not funny anymore.\n\nJayden then showed me pictures of Kayden's hand and just him laying in a hospital bad. I sarcastically said it was very convenient that he took pictures of his brother in the hospital and these definitely weren't photoshopped pictures. I left angry at Jayden for insisting on continuing such a distasteful joke and Jayden said he can't believe I think this is a joke.\n\nSince then, Jayden sent me a bunch of childhood pictures and videos of him and Kayden, and when I was complaining to a mutual friend, he said he met Kayden too and he was real. So now I'm starting to believe them... and Jayden is really mad at me.\n\nBut how was I suppose to know Kayden was real? Who has an identical twin that looks just like him?

Multiple sets of them actually", "YTA\n\nI will google this for you.......[https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/types-of-twins](https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/types-of-twins)\n\n***Identical twins*** The National Library of Medicine says that monozygotic, or identical, twins are conceived from one fertilized egg. This egg separates into two embryos after it has begun to divide. These two embryos develop into two babies. Genetic materials called chromosomes in both babies are completely identical. This is because both babies come from the same egg and sperm. For this reason, both children are assigned the same sex at birth and share the same genetic characteristics, such as eye and hair color. Still, because of differences in the environment where they\u2019re born (like the amount of space each had in the uterus), identical twins may have slight differences in appearance.\n\n***Nonidentical twins*** Not all twins are identical, of course. More often than not, twins are born with unique physical characteristics. Nonidentical twins are generally known as fraternal twins. **Fraternal twins** The scientific term for fraternal twins \u2014 \u201cdizygotic\u201d \u2014 refers to two fertilized eggs. Dizygotic twins happen when the birthing parent\u2019s body releases two eggs at the same time. A different sperm will fertilize each egg. Since fraternal twins are the result of different eggs and different sperm, they share the same percentage of chromosomes as any other siblings. The National Human Genome Research Institute Trusted Source says that this is about 50 percent. This is why they don\u2019t look exactly alike and can be assigned different sexes at birth.\n\n***Is there a third type?*** Traditionally, the science around twins has taught that identical and fraternal are the only two types. But a third type might exist, called ***polar body or half-identical twins.***  Though this has never been confirmed, a research review from 2016 suggested that a third twin type would explain why some fraternal twins look so similar.\r After the ovaries release an egg, the egg can split into two halves, the smaller of which is called a polar body. This polar body contains all the chromosomes necessary to join with a sperm to create a baby. But since it usually contains very little fluid, or cytoplasm, it\u2019s often too small to survive. It\u2019s possible, though, that a polar body could survive and be fertilized. Meanwhile, the larger half of the original egg could also be fertilized by a separate sperm. The result? Polar twins.  Polar twins share the same chromosomes from their birthing parent, but they get different chromosomes from their non-birthing parent. This is because they\u2019re created from a single egg but two separate sperm. For this reason, they may or may not be assigned the same sex at birth, and they may look very similar but not exactly identical.\n\n***Unique identical twins*** In a basic twin pregnancy, two embryos go their separate ways and develop into twin babies, whether identical or fraternal. Some unique sets of twins follow a different path.\r  \n\r  \n***Mirror twins*** Mirror twins are exactly what they sound like! These twins are actual mirror images of each other. This means that: \r  \nTheir hair may naturally fall in opposite directions.\r  \nTheir teeth may grow in on opposite sides of their mouths.\r  \nThey may have birthmarks on the opposite side of their bodies.\r  \nThey also usually have different dominant hands.\r  \nWhat causes this phenomenon? In a typical identical twin pregnancy, an egg splits during its first week after fertilization. But in a mirror twin pregnancy, the egg splits 7 to 12 days after it\u2019s been fertilized \u2014 long enough for the egg to have developed a right and a left side.\r  \n\r  \n***Conjoined twins*** Conjoined twins are a rare twin type in which the two siblings are physically connected. Typically, conjoined twins are joined together at the chest or abdomen, but this varies. Some conjoined twins are connected to a greater extent than others. Most share at least one vital organ. Though physically attached to each other, conjoined twins are two individuals. They have unique thoughts and their own personalities. Researchers are still trying to understand the origins of this type of twin birth. Some experts believe conjoined twins occur when a fertilized egg doesn\u2019t split completely. This happens when the egg divides 12 or more days after conception. Another theory is that the fertilized egg divides completely, but it later fuses back together.  A conjoined twin pregnancy is high-risk, but breakthroughs in surgery have been able to improve outcomes. Surgery can even allow conjoined twins to live independently. Although a small 2011 study Trusted Source found that just 7.5 percent of conjoined twins live past birth, advances in care for conjoined twins are being made every year.\r  \n\r  \n***Parasitic twins*** Sometimes, as twins develop in utero, one twin becomes larger and more dominant. The other twin stops developing and begins to depend on their sibling. Known as parasitic twins, these twins are physically conjoined. However, the smaller twin is not fully formed and isn\u2019t capable of surviving on their own. This is because the smaller twin is usually missing vital organs or a fully developed brain or heart. In fact, you might not even recognize the smaller twin as a separate individual. This \u201ctwin\u201d may appear on the sibling\u2019s body as a small lump, extra limbs, or a second non-functioning head. Parasitic twins may be classified into subtypes, including fetus in fetu and acardiac twins: \r  \nFetus in fetu. These are rare circumstances when a smaller twin develops inside the larger twin\u2019s body.\r  \nAcardiac twins. In this case, one twin receives too much blood flow while the other doesn\u2019t receive enough. This occurs because identical twins share a placenta.\r  \nA milder version of this is called twin to twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). Acardiac twins experience a more extreme form of TTTS that may result in developmental issues for the fetuses. Treatments like surgery can improve outcomes, according to 2015 researchTrusted Source.\r  \n\r  \n***Semi-identical twins***\r  \nThere have only been two reported cases of semi-identical twins, so this type is extremely rare.  In semi-identical twins, two separate sperm fertilize one egg. The fertilized egg then splits in two. So, semi-identical twins share all the same chromosomes from their birthing parent, but only about 50 percent from their non-birthing parent.\r  \n\r  \n***Female and male identical twins***  Sometimes identical twins can be assigned the sex of male and female at birth. These twins start off as identical males with XY sex chromosomes. But shortly after the egg divides, a genetic mutation called Turner syndrome occurs, leaving one twin with the chromosomes X0.  This twin will be assigned female at birth but may have developmental issues, as well as difficulties with fertility later in life, according to the National Health Service. The mutation doesn\u2019t affect the other twin, who is assigned male at birth.\r  \n\r  \n***Unique fraternal twins***  Twins with different ages. Once a person becomes pregnant, their body stops releasing new eggs for potential fertilization \u2014 except in some rare cases.\r A phenomenon known as superfetation can occur when a second egg gets released and fertilized after a person is already pregnant. When this happens twice within one menstrual cycle, it\u2019s known as superfecundation. In this case, both fertilized eggs will develop, but one twin will be slightly older than the other.\r  \n\r  \n***Twins with different fathers***  If two eggs are released within a single menstrual cycle, it\u2019s possible for them to be fertilized by sperm from two different people. This is known as heteropaternal superfecundation \u2014 a common occurrence in animals but very rare in people.\r  \n\r  \n***Twins with different skin colors*** It\u2019s very unlikely to have twins with different skin tones, but it can happen in three different ways: When parents are of different complexions, one of their fraternal twins may naturally resemble one parent, while the other twin looks more like the other parent. In the rare case of heteropaternal superfecundation, the two non-birthing parents may have different skin tones. Each twin would then receive that person\u2019s genetics.\r  \nWhen both parents are biracial, this usually results in twins that both look biracial. Occasionally, though, each twin may receive more genetic material from different ancestors than the other. This can lead to the twins appearing to be from different \u201craces.\u201d\r  \nMedical risks during a twin pregnancy", "I lived in a small town, with less than 5k people, when I was in school; there were FIVE sets of identical twins in my senior class.

I don\u2019t wake up in the morning and think \u201chey, I want to look different than my twin, I think I\u2019ll style my hair differently!\u201d I have no idea how my twin styles her hair, nor do I care. There will be countless environmental and epigenetic changes that occur over the years, many of them in utero. Male identicals tend to have less epigenetic changes, I can\u2019t remember the exact reason but something to do with the way make genetics are expressed. I don\u2019t look super identical to my twin and it has nothing to do with going out my \u201cway to do otherwise\u201d", "Thinking back, we didn't have any twins at my schools (in my grade, anyway) until I got to high school, where we had one set each of identical twin girls and boys. And along the lines of Jayden/Kayden, the boys were Dean and Dane.\n\nMy senior year one of the identical twin girls was voted Most Beautiful in the senior superlatives and the other one wasn't. High school is cruel.", "I never met an identical twin. That said, the Olsen twins were pretty much clones in their youth so it's not like I don't believe in them. (I'd believe in them even without the Olsen twins)", "Twins and identical twins are different", "We had 4 sets of twins in my grade but none were identical. There aren't any in the surrounding grades either.", "Oh, there were twin sets! They were just fraternal.", "I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever met identical twins? Quite a few fraternal twins, including good friends of mine who hardly look like brothers let alone twins, but no identical.", "I was good friends with a pair of identical twins in high school. I met one before I met the other though and was like \u201cWhat\u2019s up with that girl? Sometimes she\u2019s so warm and friendly to me and other times she won\u2019t even look my way in the hallway.\u201d", "I\u2019ve never to my knowledge met even half of a set of identical twins.", "I've met at least 3 sets of fraternal twins,  but never met identical twins.  Unlike OP, I believe in their existence tho.", "Identical twins are pretty rare, it happens to about 2.5 pregnancies in a thousand. \n\nMy kids are identical twins. We live in a big city and the school they\u2019re going to has about 800 students. My girls are the only identical twins in their school, so out of 800 kids. \n\nSomeone growing up in a small town might have never seen identical twins. Though, you\u2019d think in this day and age, everybody would know about it\u2026 Like, how many movies, tv shows, book talk about twins??", "I've never met identical twins either to be honest. There have been a few sets of twins I've met, but they've always been fraternal, often boy and girl instead of identical.", "The only twins in my school system - at least through High School - were fraternal. Looked completely different. I actually still haven\u2019t in person met identical twins, and I\u2019m in my mid-30\u2019s. It happens.", "Yup! In uni it was very common for my sister's friends to get annoyed that she \"ignored them\", when they were actually seeing me and she wasn't even on campus. As more fully formed adults we definitely look/act different, but still close enough to obviously be related", "That reminds me, I have aunts who are identical twins and until one married, I coudn't tell them apart.  Looking at younger photos of themselves, they can't even tell who is who, unless they remember where they were in relation to some object in the photo.", "Yeah, it's just one of those things that sometimes you run into lots of and sometimes you don't run into any of! I've met fraternal twins -- I was friends with a pair of those in elementary school -- but I'm not recalling any identical twins off the top of my head.", "They are not identical though.  They are fraternal.", "In 30+ years I\u2019ve never met any twins either, granted the biggest school I\u2019ve gone to had ~700 students but my high school had people from a lot of different areas instead and no twins. \n\nAnd considering the chance of giving birth to identical twins is really low, 0.5% apparently, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not uncommon for people to not have met any. Now fraternal or non identical twins are a lot more common as 75% of twins are fraternal but then it would be hard to know unless you knew them or it came up in conversation.", "Wow no need to be rude. I have never met identical twins either. I dont live under a rock (and I assume the person you replied to don't.)\n\nSure I have seen pictures of identical twins. Even seen them in television and youtube. But real life meet and greet? No. Unless I only met one twin and never saw the other person with them.", "I don't live under a rock, and I have seen them around, we've just never happened to meet. Plain dumb luck. I believe that they're everywhere; it's just happenstance. Please don't be rude for no reason.", "I thought the same for one set in my year\u2014I thought I just kept forgetting one person\u2019s name until I realized there were two of them.", "It just sounds like they half assed it", "I also know a Taylor and Tyler twins", ">This person\u2019s brain is obviously still in its plastic wrap.\n\nA+ insult!", "Fair point, well made!", "I'm stealing that insult", "Apologies to everyone with brain injuries!", "Yup. In fairness, lots of people love to name their individual babies stupid shit too, so it's not terribly surprising. But from what I've seen of even fraternal twins, the common sense seems to go out the window when someone has twins, and they start naming them similarly and dressing them identically a scary amount of the time. I don't know any identicals personally but I can't imagine it's any better for them, if the fraternals are already treated like that.", "Not *now,* when you presumably don't live or work together and don't see each other every day. But, hones question, when you were teenagers and went to the same school together, did you make an effort to not look identical? Or can you understand why some twins might?", "No idea why you are getting downvotes for being an actual identical twin. Reddit is bizarre", ">one of the identical twin girls was voted Most Beautiful in the senior superlatives and the other one wasn't. High school is cruel.\n\nOh wow. Did the one who wasn't take it as a compliment or just feel left out? I'm assuming they had to pick one of them and couldn't vote for both? And I don't see how they could guarantee a tie. So it would be neither of them should win just to avoid this or this scenario. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the whole superlatives thing is dumb IMO, especially based on looks. But other than both of them being disqualified for being twins, what could have been done?", "They're fraternal actually", "This is so weird to me. There were 2 sets in my high school and probably some in earlier grades I just don't remember. Plus one set in my daughter's preschool. And she (my daughter) dated an identical twin in high school), so at least one set there.", "Dang and here I am, by the time I was 25 I had already dated two different guys who had identical twin brothers. Not as in I dated the twin, but two different guys who respectively each also had a twin. \n\nThey *did* look different by the time they reached adulthood, but it\u2019s usually really subtle stuff. Like, one refused to wear his retainer when the braces came off, so his teeth were a little bit crooked. The other one made some really rough lifestyle choices during teenage years, so he was actually a little bit shorter because he stunted his growth. \n\nIt\u2019s interesting to see. I also have two sets of girl friends that are twins, one identical and the other fraternal. I also went to school with another set of girl identicals. One of the fraternal friends just had her first pregnancy and turns out she was also having twins!", "Well, not everyone is good at naming children or pets. It could be a lot worse. Like C1lD-Twn1 and C1lD-Twn2 as if it's a password lol", "I have seen so much worse.  My SIL and her sister both have names that start with the same letter and end with Anne.  And they are not even twins.  \n\nOf course even worse is a set of baby twins in my kids class - Thaddeus and Peter.  I always felt so bad for poor Thaddeus.", "Omg my name is Tyler and if I had a twin named Taylor I would fuckin lose it haha", "you can make a rude comment while still being an identical twin.\n\nthe original comment carefully makes absolutely no generalizations. not a single statement presumes to apply to ~all~ identical twins. assuming a generalization where there is none and then getting upset about it isn't a very nice thing to do.", "I don't know, I wasn't friends with them. I do recall being shocked that the yearbook advisor didn't step in and say \"We've gotta go with second place here\" and pick someone who didn't have an identical person walking around the same school.", "See? All the more reason to believe in identical being identical if fraternal looks so much alike!", "I've had fraternal twin friends, just no identicals. And apparently, twins run in families, so I guess it's not too surprising that your twin friend is having twins!", "I\u2019m sorry are we saying picking decent names is hard ? Peter and Lucas. There ya go. Took me 3 seconds.", "I don\u2019t know, I like Thaddeus more than Peter as a name but I may be biased because I read too much and have seen several characters named Thaddeus so it\u2019s not strange to me anymore.", "My friend recently just told me she met a woman who had named her twin sons with both hyphenated first names and the first part of the hyphenated name is the same name and the second part is similar. Like Thomas-Lee and Thomas-Lyle. \n\nThey're in their 30s now. The woman also told my friend one always has a bad time getting loans because the \"stupid people\" thought he was one man with 2 identities for fraud reasons, and it got flagged up, and even though it was cleared up at the time, there's some sort of mark against his name. But it's totally the fraud investigators fault for assuming fraud and not that someone named their twin children in the 90s virtually the same name.", "ngl, I'm an identical twin and found this hilarious. idk if I would have in high school but from my perspective, it's pretty funny.", "I've known fraternal twins that I couldn't tell apart, and identical twins that I could. Nature is weird, I guess.", "It is indeed simple to pick normal names. But a lot of people find it hard to do so. Either because of stupidity, because they're caught up in the moment, because they're not good with names etc", "Were you high on drugs and exhaustion when you did that ?", "Exactly!  One set of sororal twins (which I believe is the name for female non-identical twins) when I was in high school, I thought they were having me on when they said they weren't identical.  Just a very strong familial resemblance.\n\nOne set of identical twins I've since met looked nothing alike, even different heights, but I think they had twin to twin syndrome and, apparently, if there is a misread made in the dna? when the egg splits and then the two parts continue to grow, if it happens in the area governing physical appearance, they can look different.  \n\nI never knew that until I studied it, just out of interest.", "Nah if I were I\u2019d have suggested Peter and Meter. Or maybe Lucas and Zucas."]}
