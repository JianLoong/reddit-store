You lost yoyr sister it is normal to grieve.\n\n\nYou MIL causing a tantrum is pure evil, if it was her sibling who died she would have requested support.\n\nDo not downplay your feelings because it is not your culture. The grieving time varies from person to person depending on the attachment you had toward the lost one.\n\nDo not go to the dinner if you do not want to and explain properly why you feel sad/distressed/angry. Your husband should support you.", "NTA - forgiveness would require an admission of wrongdoing and an apology on her part.", "NTA. I would limit interactions with her and have a serious convo with your husband about why he can't stand up to his mother.", "NTA. Get a better husband.", "NTA. I am so sorry for the loss of your sister. Your husband sounds like a jerk for calling you an AH and petty when you\u2019re still grieving. I wish you well.", "NTA. I am so sorry for your loss. And sorry that your husband puts his mother before his wife and child. Not cool.", "**NTA**\n\nSo here's the thing... I don't know what your husband's culture is, but I'd like to make an analogy from my culture, which has a similar tradition. In my culture, when someone dies, the family spends the first 7 days afterwards in intense mourning, surrounded by family. For 30 days after that, they continue to have a period where the mourning is less prescriptive (e.g. they are not confined to the house, with visitors coming daily), but as you describe, they do not partake in festive things like parties or concerts. And for a full year after the death, they say a daily prayer in remembrance of the one they lost. \n\nBut here's the important thing, and the reason I'm sharing this: EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE prescribed mourning periods and rituals exists, not as some random 'religious obligation' but rather as an acknowledgement of the human need to take time to grieve. They exist to CREATE SPACE FOR THE ONES LEFT BEHIND TO MOURN, by ensuring that they have an excuse, in the midst of a busy world, to say, \"I'm sorry, I'm in a period of mourning, I cannot do this thing.\" It is a way to make sure that grieving family members are able to sit with their loss and work through it. \n\nSo most people I know, in my culture, when faced with a friend or family-by-marriage who is not part of our culture who loses someone they love, will not dismiss them and say, \"Well, they aren't part of our culture\". Instead, they will remember why we do these things and say, \"Don't forget to take that time for yourself as well.\" They will understand WHY we do these things and encourage their friend or loved one to create that space to grieve even if it is not in the exact same way, BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IT IS NECESSARY AND HELPFUL.\n\nAll of this I share to make the point that your MIL was completely in the wrong. It doesn't matter if it wasn't your culture. You lost your sister. You are grieving deeply. Yes, it was fine for her to go on her trip; but the appropriate thing to do, as the mother of your husband, was to encourage him to support you in your grief and to make space for you to mourn, as someone would do for her in her culture. Period. You are absolutely NTA. She was very selfish and cruel.", "Info: why did a trip to the airport take a whole day?  How far is the airport?", "NTA- you are grieving a big loss. There should be compassionate understanding and support on your husbands side. He should not have name called you. Sorry for your loss.", "NTA\n\nYour husband needs to cut the apron strings. He married you; you and his child need to be his #1 and #2 priorities. Mom gets spot #3 at *most*. He was absolutely wrong to give into her.", "NTA.  Both hubby and mil are AH's in this case.", "Your MIL accuses you of stealing her son away from her then your husband gets annoyed with you for being off with her after you said she could do what she wanted\n\nSounds like she wanted to have words with you about it. You had every right to deny it, and it sounds like your husband is a mommas boy for not defending you. NTA", "Info: how was your mil planning to go to the airport in the first place, and was she planning to cancel when she heard the news?", "NTA. It started being a MIL problem that you can resolve by going low contact with her and it ended with a husband problem for calling you petty. I will NEVER understand family members/husbands that say these kinds of stuff, like they expect you to forget and roll over like a doormat to your MIL? I don't think so......stand your ground until she apologizes to you. Protect your peace and mental health at all costs!!!", "As I read this, I was thinking that your MIL is still grieving, she's struggling, and wanted to do something nice for herself, and you were gracious enough to lend your husband for a day.\n\nNope, not at all. You have a classic husband problem. Why the hell is he berating you while your grief is so fresh? What the hell is wrong with his family? \n\nNTA. Sorry for your loss OP.", "You have a husband problem, not a MIL problem. \nObviously you're NTA, but you are in for a lifetime of this nonsense for you and your child(ren) if you don't sit down with mommy's little baby boy and discuss some FIRM boundaries. Ideally with a therapist. \nI'm so sorry about your sister.", "Firstly, I\u2019m so sorry for the loss of your sister.\n\nHowever, I think you might not be seeing totally clearly due to grief and the fact that you don\u2019t get along with your MIL. IMO it was reasonable for your husband to take her to the airport, especially as you\u2019d already said you didn\u2019t mind her going. I mean, he should be able to leave you alone for the day, right?\n\nI\u2019m gonna go E S H. \n\nYou should be ok on your own for the day and he is entitled to spend a day helping his mother out.\n\nYour husband should\u2019ve offered to take the child with him, and stood up for you when his mother was rude.\n\nYour MIL should\u2019ve been more sensitive.\n\nETA: I\u2019m not sure why you offered up the information about the baby shower. That was over a year ago and not relevant, unless you\u2019re trying to say that your MIL and husband should\u2019ve also put everything on hold for 30 days, despite you telling them not to. If that\u2019s the case, it would probably switch you over into soft Y T A territory for me.\n\nETA: I got the dates mixed up and didn\u2019t realise it was so soon after losing your sister.
