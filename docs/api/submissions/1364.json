You could have couched that a lot more deftly in the sense like \"Bro, we know your a little on the heavy side but she has been with you four months and if you want to lose weight I'm cheerleader #1 in your corner and on your side.\" \"But yeah, you are chubbier than her...\"\n\nPSA think out the ramifications of every text you make.", "Yikes.", "This is a joke right? Of course your the asshole and tbh it sounds like you don't even like this \"friend\".

It shouldn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re fat if you can be a loving, supportive partner to someone, conventionally attractive or not. That close-mindedness is just sad."]}
