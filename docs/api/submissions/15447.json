I did inmigrant wage jobs for 3 years (I am an engineer) and then got a nice job opportunity in the midwest, so I moved out immediately. It was hard since there are not as many latin americans here, but things got way better. Now I even have my own office.\n\nDuring lockdown I've met Ashlee. We started dating on the phone (we live in the same city) and after we could finally go out, started dating for real, she has a daughter, Susan, who now a few months about to be 18.  Susan is kinda shy with me but we get along very well. After a while Ashlee asked me to move in with her and I said yes.\n\nNow, recently we were home and I hear them talk in the living room. Ashlee asked Susan to start paying rent the day she turns 18. Susan was angry because she doesn't earn that much with her part time job. Ashlee said that if she doesn't want to pay her rent, she can get out of the apartment and find her own place at marker price, then Susan started crying. Later I talked with Ashlee and asked why she was asking for rent, she just said \"Its about time she starts paying\". I was confused, in Latinoam\u00e9rica that never happens, not that I know of, people over 30 still living with their parents contribute to the home but doesn't pay rent. So I asked her again why she is charging her own daughter rent and giving an ultimatum? Ashlee said \"she most pay rent, she can't be a freeloader forver\" but still, it's your daughter, not a stranger who broke into her home and changed the locks, its HER DAUGHTER!\n\nShe didn't see my point of view, her arguments were more like \"just because\". I told her she is a bad mother for being willing to kick her daughter to the street and treating her like an stranger. Ashlee got into my face and told me \"You don't know shit about this country, I paid rent to my parents until I moved out, get used to it, you are just my boyfriend, not her step dad, so SHUT THE FUCK UP, SUSAN IS MU DAUGHTER AND I CAN DO WHAT I WANT WITH HER\" (sorry for the caps but she was yelling loud at this point).\n\nI never saw her like this, I guess everything she said is true, but this seems alien and bizarre to me. The next morning she told me I had to sleep somewhere else because didn't want to see my face, so I'm sleeping at my office. Susan called me to say she is sorry we had an argument because of her.\n\nI'm I overstepping? Is this normal and expected in this country? Should I minded my own business and not say anything?", "created_utc": 1682189843, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12vfksf/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_she_is_a_bad/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am in the UK, my parents never made me pay rent, it seems to be a mix, some do some don\u2019t, but if they do it\u2019s a bit more of a token amount nothing like market rate and certainly not threatening to throw anyone out!", "NTA. once i got a job, i started paying toward household expenses but not because of an ultimatum. my mother knew what i could and could not afford and charged me accordingly. this is not what ashlee is doing. now, whether it\u2019s because she thinks that\u2019s how things should be done or because she\u2019s an AH, i couldn\u2019t say.", "NTA.

Is this a relationship you can see succeeding longer term? \n\nThink hard because, whilst she's right that it's a common enough thing in America, it's certainly not universal and her justification seems to be that she had to endure it so her daughter will too, which seems a crappy reason.\n\nI'm all for teaching kids to be financially independent but, unless your GF can't afford to, wouldn't it be better to apply that on a gradual timeline? \n\nAnyway NTA for sharing your opinion but a bit for making it into an argument.

This is normal in my experience of living here. A lot of 18/19 year olds are expected to also move out the first moment they are able to (sometimes they just get kicked out), because how DARE a PARENT see their CHILD as a child instead of a burdensome freeloader?\n\nIt's more common for young women instead of men.\n\nYou're NTA. Idk why American parents are so focused on getting rid of their children at their earliest convenience and forcing them to be adults. Don't have kids if you feel like they're a burden.", "NTA- I totally agree with you and don\u2019t understand the mindset of making kids fend for themselves the day the they turn 18. It\u2019s no way to treat your family. If they live at home for free for years and years, maybe.", "NTA - some parents in the US believe at 18 kids should be on their own, possibly because that\u2019s how they were raised? But most parents I know don\u2019t believe that. Most of us know that at 18, they may be adults but most are still kids, their brains are still maturing. No way would I kick my kid out at 18!\n\nNow, I did raise my kids to get an education as college was my goal for them. If that wasn\u2019t something they wanted/could do, then get a job or enlist because they needed to do something. \n\nI\u2019ve supported myself since I was 18, through college and grad school. Not that I expect them to do the same - quite the opposite. I want to help them achieve their goals. Once they are out of college, though, and can make a decent living, I charge a small amount each month in rent to help them learn to budget. This money will come back to them when they move out, but they don\u2019t know that.\n\nYour gf is totally TA here. Perhaps she\u2019s like my mother who mentioned if I\u2019d move back home, I could pay rent. She had already started planning what to do with the extra $$ she\u2019d get when I said no. Pissed her off but no way would I live with her ever again. Does your gf need the extra money, or is it merely because it\u2019s how she was raised? Because it\u2019s not typical. And is Susan going to college? It\u2019s damned hard to support yourself in college when you have to work, too.\n\nIf you really want to salvage this relationship, sit down with your gf and have a calm, rational discussion. Me thinks that it won\u2019t stay that way long and you\u2019ll decide it\u2019s not worth it. Good luck.", "NTA. Some parents expect children to leave or pay rent when they turn 18 while many do not.

Your girlfriend's reaction seems unusually angry.", "INFO: Did you call her a bad mother explicitly? I missed it in your post, but you put it in the title.\n\nI agree with your sentiment about charging kids rent. But Ashlee also explained (loudly) that this was normal in her family. And it is somewhat normal in parts of this country. \n\nSome parents charge some rent and save it to give back when the kid moves out. Some keep it. \n\nYour questioning puts Ashlee in a troubling place because if she accepts it's wrong to charge her kid rent, then she's also accepting that her parents exploited her to some extent. Right or wrong, you're not just challenging an idea but possibly her whole family dynamics. \n\nI don't know the other dynamics of your relationship so I don't know how you normally resolve differences in values. For my original question, if you said she's a bad mother then it doesn't sound like an attempt to come to an understanding, just judgment.", "NTA. Forcing an 18 year old to pay rent immediately is evil. They should atleast have graduated high school first and even then giving a few months after to decide to move or pay rent", "NTA to question it. It isn't normal here either. The only way I would charge my kid \"rent\" would be a percentage of their current income, and that money would get set aside to give back to them when they were ready to move out. The only ultimatum I had was that he had to either go to school or get a full-time job (he worked a year and is now using that money to pay for a robotics degree).", "kids paying rent is pretty normal as it teaches responsibilities ect but only like \u00a325 a week , That's what I did with my eldest which i put in a bank for him as I didn't need the money and then when he joined the army he had a good amount of money as a surprise .

I would reconsider this relationship, though, if you are wanting children of your own.", " NTA. In the US, if adult children live with their parents it\u2019s normal for them to pay rent. It\u2019s usually a small amount that helps with household expenses. However parents usually give the kids an opportunity to get settled into adult life by going to school or get in g a full time job before that happens. It\u2019s not right for your gf to expect her daughter to pay rent so soon.", "NTA. I'm 34, and I live with my parents, and I don't pay rent. However, I do contribute to the household by doing a lot of the chores and stuff, which, in my opinion, is better. I do believe that adult children who live at home should have to contribute in some way, but I don't think charging rent is the right answer.", ">I'm I overstepping?
