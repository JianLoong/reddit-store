We started dating on the phone (we live in the same city) and after we could finally go out, started dating for real, she has a daughter, Susan, who now a few months about to be 18.  Susan is kinda shy with me but we get along very well. After a while Ashlee asked me to move in with her and I said yes.\n\nNow, recently we were home and I hear them talk in the living room. Ashlee asked Susan to start paying rent the day she turns 18. Susan was angry because she doesn't earn that much with her part time job. Ashlee said that if she doesn't want to pay her rent, she can get out of the apartment and find her own place at marker price, then Susan started crying. Later I talked with Ashlee and asked why she was asking for rent, she just said \"Its about time she starts paying\". I was confused, in Latinoam\u00e9rica that never happens, not that I know of, people over 30 still living with their parents contribute to the home but doesn't pay rent. So I asked her again why she is charging her own daughter rent and giving an ultimatum? Ashlee said \"she most pay rent, she can't be a freeloader forver\" but still, it's your daughter, not a stranger who broke into her home and changed the locks, its HER DAUGHTER!\n\nShe didn't see my point of view, her arguments were more like \"just because\". I told her she is a bad mother for being willing to kick her daughter to the street and treating her like an stranger. Ashlee got into my face and told me \"You don't know shit about this country, I paid rent to my parents until I moved out, get used to it, you are just my boyfriend, not her step dad, so SHUT THE FUCK UP, SUSAN IS MU DAUGHTER AND I CAN DO WHAT I WANT WITH HER\" (sorry for the caps but she was yelling loud at this point).\n\nI never saw her like this, I guess everything she said is true, but this seems alien and bizarre to me. The next morning she told me I had to sleep somewhere else because didn't want to see my face, so I'm sleeping at my office. Susan called me to say she is sorry we had an argument because of her.\n\nI'm I overstepping? Is this normal and expected in this country?
