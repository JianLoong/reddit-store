Susan is kinda shy with me but we get along very well. After a while Ashlee asked me to move in with her and I said yes.\n\nNow, recently we were home and I hear them talk in the living room. Ashlee asked Susan to start paying rent the day she turns 18. Susan was angry because she doesn't earn that much with her part time job. Ashlee said that if she doesn't want to pay her rent, she can get out of the apartment and find her own place at marker price, then Susan started crying. Later I talked with Ashlee and asked why she was asking for rent, she just said \"Its about time she starts paying\". I was confused, in Latinoam\u00e9rica that never happens, not that I know of, people over 30 still living with their parents contribute to the home but doesn't pay rent. So I asked her again why she is charging her own daughter rent and giving an ultimatum? Ashlee said \"she most pay rent, she can't be a freeloader forver\" but still, it's your daughter, not a stranger who broke into her home and changed the locks, its HER DAUGHTER!\n\nShe didn't see my point of view, her arguments were more like \"just because\". I told her she is a bad mother for being willing to kick her daughter to the street and treating her like an stranger.

The next morning she told me I had to sleep somewhere else because didn't want to see my face, so I'm sleeping at my office.

This is a bad american custom but in america it's very me oriented. It's not family oriented", "NTA  Poor Susan.  Find someone better.", "I\u2019m really tired of everyone making generalizations about the US. It is uncommon for any 18 year old to pay rent unless they have graduated and are working full time and usually not even then.  I think everyone on this sub should have to I.D .   their country so we can all make these generalizations.  You make think you know US culture and I can guarantee you don\u2019t because we have multiple subcultures.", "NTA. I\u2019m from the Midwest in the US and no one I know has their kids pay rent. Ashley is acting like this is what everyone here does, and that is just wrong.", "Oh wow I'm happy to read all these comments here, thank you!", "Exactly.\n\nAshlee is taking her personal issues out on her daughter. \"I had to suffer, so she does, too\" is unfortunately a very prevalent attitude in midwestern America. If Ashlee isn't willing to examine/fix her own problematic behavior, then ultimately it's up to OP to decide if he really wants to stay with a person who will blindly and stubbornly inflict cruelty upon those closest to her.", ">told her she is a bad mother for being willing to kick her daughter to the street\n\nYes.", ">In my country, if I had left at 18, I'd have to live in a literal slum with 6 other people. At 18 you don't have living wage here in South America, and apparently not now in the USA nowadays. Also you have to study.\n\nIn venezuela is even worst, many people I know have their entire extended family packed into a little house with roofs made out of \"Lata de Zinc\".\n\nI was living with my parents, 3 siblings, their partners, and 2 little nephews until I went to the US, I did my whole engineering career without leaving home. We weren't poor, but after the total economic crash we downgraded way too much and our once nice neighborhood got filled with criminality. Currently no person in their 20's in my country can expect to do a downpayment on an apartment unless they get some magic suma of money from somewhere.", "Just curious about the car insurance - it is very expensive for young drivers in the UK too, that's why many young drivers are added to some of their parent's insurance as an additional driver. It is cheaper this way. Is there such an option in USA?", "She's about to destroy her relationship with her kid.  I dated two people who were given zero support after 18 and they were both deeply resentful individuals.  \n\nThis is a bad fuxking move and deserves to be called what it is.", "Susan will be out of school this year.\n\nAshlee is asking a HUGE amount, barely like 30% less than market price, is still not market price, but even so, the simple concept of charging rent to her own daughter sound unreasonable to me, and almost at market price is crazy.", "I could gladly do it if it was the case but I dont know if it would be appropriate. I'm an almost middle age man dating his mother. \n\nI want to try and fix things with Ashlee so nobody has to take drastic measures. Hope communication can solve everything.", "I'm American and only psychos do this. I think the majority of parents in the USA would not do this. But it is part of the larger culture of \"independence\" taken too far, and the destruction of multi generational family.\n\nCertainly not common in my socio economic circles to treat kids like this, I'm always shocked when I read these stories and I'm from the USA", " I'm an American and kicking your kid out or making them pay rent at 18 is generally seen as a low class thing to do. At least in my social  circle.", "I'm so happy to hear that, I see in most comments people encourage the OPs with NC or that their child is lazy and should pay or 'go pay it's not your house not your rules' thing etc and it really disappoints me, I don't reply to them but they come to me and call me out for saying my opinion and how I think.", "Well in this post it's like it's a must and people on comments encourage it! They say that's how it is in USA", "Glad to hear this", "She is added to my policy to be able to receive the same discounts I have, but even with those discounts, it's still  160$ a month to add her. For her, $160 a month is easily doable since it's her only bill (except she pays for her own gas.) For me, it would be a stretch along with my much more substantial bills. I provide everything else for her and wouldn't expect her to pay for any necessities. I tried giving her gas money but she won't take it. \n\nI'm not sure what all is an option in USA. There are  differences between INS companies and what they offer. There's even different policies/laws between different states. I only know what options I had with my own ins provider.", "I have a couple of friends who live in usa and they also never said something like this. That's why i said i didn't knew about this till reddit. I once said that my house is my kids'a house and i got downvoted for that. Mostly i think teenagers on reddit act like this, they say at 18 you're grown up, but god forbid to say something to a 17 yo, cause their brain isn't evolved yet. There are many things who only make sense on reddit aita and nowhere else in the world", "The only time I've seen this in the US is when an 18+ year old neither wants to work nor go to school and wants to just stay home playing video games or something without contributing anything. Sometimes they're spoiled, sometimes they need mental health treatment, but the rent is to motivate them rather than enable them. Otherwise, it seems uncommon, not discussed much except on reddit.", "It's probably something that only makes sense on aita. There is a post now where a guy asked his 20yo rent and she said she won't pay and everyone calls her entitled and manipulative. I agree with you that would be a low class thing to do.", "Reading these stories makes me realise how lucky I was. It was long ago, in an East European country, when I was in high school and then in university, I was receiving a student grant, which depended on the academic grades, so I didn't have a job but had my own money. My parents stated numerous times that my job is to do well with my studies, they did not want me to contribute financially, when I suggested this, they said - we are doing well and don't need your money, use them for books, save them or whatever you want, if the things change in the future, we'll tell you.  \n\nWhen my daughter was a student, we were in the UK, no such student grants, but her father and I supported her, so that she didn't have to work and could do her best with her demanding degree. I have been teaching for many years in universities both in my home country and in the UK, and I know from experience that working during the academic year does not benefit the academic performance of the students, especially if the job is not related to their degree course (I am in IT). Even if they work an IT job, it somewhat tunnels their vision and limits the experience they could get in other areas through extra-curriculum research projects.", "Gosh, it's an insane price.", "Is one thing if parents/family is abusive. But the op here was talking about situation where a parent said/ did something dumb or made a minor mistake. For exemple there was a post that a lady wrote where she mentioned her mother buying pink onesies for her newborn daughter and everyone yelled to go nc because the grandma was trying to use stereotypical gendered clothes and it will cause mental health issues. For the life of me i can't imagine a newborn having mental issues caused by the color of their onesies. And many others just like this. You had a fight with mil or sil or bil about christmas cooking? Go nc with them. You argued with your sister cause she used your makeup? Go nc with her. Your sibling asked you one time to babysit as an emergency solution? Go nc with sibling, parents, cousins and everyone else in the family cause you don't owe them to babysit. I support nc when it's needed, but aita exagerates with it. Just like with therapy. I agree that it can help, but good lord... they reccomend therapy all the time and for literally everything."]}
