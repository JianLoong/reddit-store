We started dating on the phone (we live in the same city) and after we could finally go out, started dating for real, she has a daughter, Susan, who now a few months about to be 18.  Susan is kinda shy with me but we get along very well. After a while Ashlee asked me to move in with her and I said yes.\n\nNow, recently we were home and I hear them talk in the living room. Ashlee asked Susan to start paying rent the day she turns 18. Susan was angry because she doesn't earn that much with her part time job. Ashlee said that if she doesn't want to pay her rent, she can get out of the apartment and find her own place at marker price, then Susan started crying. Later I talked with Ashlee and asked why she was asking for rent, she just said \"Its about time she starts paying\". I was confused, in Latinoam\u00e9rica that never happens, not that I know of, people over 30 still living with their parents contribute to the home but doesn't pay rent. So I asked her again why she is charging her own daughter rent and giving an ultimatum? Ashlee said \"she most pay rent, she can't be a freeloader forver\" but still, it's your daughter, not a stranger who broke into her home and changed the locks, its HER DAUGHTER!\n\nShe didn't see my point of view, her arguments were more like \"just because\". I told her she is a bad mother for being willing to kick her daughter to the street and treating her like an stranger. Ashlee got into my face and told me \"You don't know shit about this country, I paid rent to my parents until I moved out, get used to it, you are just my boyfriend, not her step dad, so SHUT THE FUCK UP, SUSAN IS MU DAUGHTER AND I CAN DO WHAT I WANT WITH HER\" (sorry for the caps but she was yelling loud at this point).\n\nI never saw her like this, I guess everything she said is true, but this seems alien and bizarre to me. The next morning she told me I had to sleep somewhere else because didn't want to see my face, so I'm sleeping at my office. Susan called me to say she is sorry we had an argument because of her.\n\nI'm I overstepping? Is this normal and expected in this country?

Unfortunately the times have changed since their parents days, so renting is nearly impossible for children and minimum wage barely covers anything so many 18 year olds still live at home. So you combine those two things together and it seems cruel to charge your children rent when it is incredibly difficult to live outside of your parents house. It\u2019s a sad truth. You need to have an honest conversation with your girlfriend about how she treated you because that wasn\u2019t right", "Op, you are NTA\n\nBut I need to ask European Redditors about Arnold Schwarzenegger'experience. He wrote in his autobiography that he had to pay a form of rent to his parents while living with them in Austria. It was considered so unusual, that an acting coach in Hollywood brought it up as a mining source of negative emotions. Arnie for his part didn't feel his parents were wrong to charge him rent.\n\nSo do Austrian parents still charge their kids rent? Was it always the case that in parts of the US teens paid rent but other parts, didn't? Do some Europeans, charge rent?", "In a lot of places outside the US, the expectation that someone suddenly becomes an adult once they're 18 doesn't exist.

In my culture at least.", "Does your family give an ultimatum when asking for rent? \n\nI think that's the AH part really.", "NTA. With the rate of inflation in the housing market in the US in the recent years it\u2019s become increasingly difficult to live alone from a young age- and in the US it\u2019s been perceived to be a weakness and a burden on parents to let kids live in their home past 18. It\u2019s a straight up myth. Back in the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s it was easier and cheaper (relatively) to send kids to college and get them to live somewhere else besides home.\nhell buying your own house would cost you 6 grapes and a length of garden hose (ITS JUST A JOKE though I do know someone who bought their land with a load of grapes and donkey fertilizer back in the 70\u2019s).\nBUT IT\u2019S DIFFERENT NOW. The best households I\u2019ve seen work out were with the younger adult kids working jobs and contributing to household costs. NOT paying full rent, but contributing to the house, while sticking money away to buy their own plot of land or house someday. \nLook, it\u2019s not easy to live in the US. but I will say that not giving your kids the love and support they need is a guaranteed recipe to fail. And what they need depends on the climate they live in- so when in Rome (AKA The US) you don\u2019t kick them out to the streets at 18. If she can\u2019t work with her daughter then please don\u2019t try and stay in a relationship with her.", "It\u2019s an issue of what you classify as adulthood. At least where I am, it\u2019s virtually impossible to get a career-level income straight out of high school; you need either trade training, or further education \u2014 either of which means little or no income for some time. \n\nSo the question becomes, does parental obligation end at the 18th birthday when the child is no longer a minor by legal definition? Or does it end when the child has been given sufficient foundation to survive independently? If the parent is charging a trivial amount of rent to start teaching responsibility, then that\u2019s one thing, but if they\u2019re doing it because they think someone is a \u201cfreeloader\u201d if they don\u2019t pay rent at 18, then they\u2019re failing to account for changes to the job market which have shifted the realistic age of independence for the average person.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that support in early adulthood has lasting consequences. Kids who don\u2019t need to work (or who can work less) in college are more likely to be able to take unpaid internships, collect volunteer hours, network with their professors (aka, get good letters of recommendation), not to mention having time to work on their actual classes. The biology department in my university had a policy that only 10% of the class could receive A-range grades (I forget what percent could get B\u2019s and C\u2019s), so if everyone got at least a 90% on an exam, the letter grade was curved such that a 90% would be a D; if your GPA is dependent on how you compare to your classmates rather than just whether you learn the material, then how much time you have to study and whether you can afford tutoring makes a pretty huge difference. This doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t possibly succeed while working in college, but it does mean that when you hit the job market, you\u2019re going to be compared to people who had very different opportunities. Personally, I think there are only three good reasons to charge a kid rent at 18: 1) if there\u2019s significant financial strain and that\u2019s the only way to keep the bills paid, 2) if they\u2019re not being responsible and charging rent is being used to remind them that real life will come with bills and responsibilities, or 3) they took a different path and are already in their long-term career at 18. I can also see an argument for charging rent to teach responsibility but putting it into a savings account to help pay off student loans or help with housing costs when they do move out, but realistically, unpaid internships and networking opportunities will probably boost their long-term salary more than such a savings fund could help them. I also think there\u2019s something coercive about charging someone rent when you know they couldn\u2019t possibly move out; where I am, it\u2019s very very difficult to get an apartment without a credit history unless you have a co-signer, regardless of income, so a parent charging their kid rent knows the child has to agree to their terms unless they want to be homeless. It\u2019s one thing when a company capitalized on the necessities of their customers, but a parent doing so feels wrong to me.\n\nAnyway, this got quite long, and I do know that other reasonable perspectives exist, but I hope I answered your question!", "That's good but it worries me the ppl on comments wbo encourage it and find it normal sand that that's how it works there.", "Just judging based on the comments on several stories", "\"Arnie didn't feel the parents were wrong\" see what I mean.

Like no that's your daughter. \n\nBeyond that I'd end the relationship with anyone who says I can't stay in a place I help pay for because they are mad looking at me because of my opinion.

Not immediately at 18, because it read only at holidays then, but I did pay rent for about a year before I moved out again. \n\nThat was in Europe - you over generalised.

They shouldn\u2019t be downvoting simply because they disagree with adult offspring paying rent. There\u2019s a book called the millionaire next door that kind of touches on this, if the adult offspring has a stable job, they\u2019ll be more financially responsible if their parents let them learn how to be responsible by having them contribute. Adult Offspring who receive gifts are usually less responsible, and free housing is a gift. Sounds harsh, but it truly isn\u2019t. I moved out at 17 to go to college, my parents helped me in college but I still got financial aid and finally paid it off a few years ago. At 18, it\u2019s time to learn how to use money to support yourself. If the offspring continue to further themselves, it\u2019s okay to help them succeed but if they just want to stay at home and not get a job, their financial understanding and growth will be stunted and they\u2019ll continue to rely on their parents.", "In Italy a parent has the legal obligation to support their children until they're financially independent, even if the children are of age. Of course this doesn't mean that people can just decide not to work at all or expect not to contribute to the household, but that contribution should be proportional to income, and would go towards covering the expenses of the household in general. \n\nParents generally can't legally charge rent if the child isn't financially independent and cannot afford to rent their own house.", "Strange", "Makes sense! Thank you.", "Thanks for the cultural insight!", "You think it weird that a 22 year old graduate pays rent? If you think I meant an 18 yr old school boy... Reread my comment.", "Oh gotcha, I misread that! \n\nI can see more of an argument for charging rent if they\u2019re in a professional career, but personally I wouldn\u2019t do it, and my parents have made clear that they will never charge me rent so long as I\u2019m being responsible. I know this will sound funny, but I actually find it easier to understand a parent saying it\u2019s time to move out than to understand them charging their kid rent. It\u2019s a little difficult to dissect my feelings on this, but I\u2019ll try to explain my reasoning:\n\n1. Less applicable to other countries/cultures, but in my experience, most adults don\u2019t *want* to live with their parents unless something is wrong; either they\u2019re going through something difficult and need their support system, or money is really tight and they need to save as much as they can. While a random stranger isn\u2019t obligated to step up during difficult times, it feels wrong for a parent to profit off of their child\u2019s difficult times. \n\n2. Many parents ultimately depend on their children in their old age (even if that\u2019s not their plan), either for help maintaining their own living situation, help getting into a care setting, power of attorney responsibilities, or a place to live. Raising a kid to the age of 18 isn\u2019t doing the kid a favor \u2014 the kid never asked to be born \u2014 so things like a free place to live until achieving more independence are the a way the parent can create more give-and-take in that relationship. And the better the kid is set up in early adulthood, the less of a strain those responsibilities will be later. It\u2019s not a quid pro quo, but the more support a parent offers through adulthood, the better their relationship with their kids and the more reciprocal that dynamic will be.\n\n3. A good parent is a child\u2019s most stable and reliable support figure; to charge a child rent says \u201cYour presence here reduces the quality of the space for me / is a burden to me, so you\u2019ll need to pay me to compensate for that,\u201d and that\u2019s not the message I\u2019d want to send to my kids. \u201cYou\u2019ll always have a place to stay if you need it\u201d represents a stable and dependable source of support without the suggestion that the support is given grudgingly, and I think that\u2019s a parent\u2014child dynamic worth aspiring to. \n\nI\u2019ll clarify, once the kid is into their long-term career, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s *wrong* to charge them rent; not all parent\u2014child relationships are strong, not all kids are responsible and/or respectful, and it\u2019s reasonable for an adult parent to want their home to themselves. But, while I understand that perspective in theory, it\u2019s hard for me to relate to or really embrace, unless the kid has done something to damage the relationship. To me, in healthy and happy families, offering support to one another is a wonderful thing, not a burden, and once you put a price tag on something you\u2019re saying it is a burden to you. Realistically, I know my parents are probably glad I\u2019m moved out and they have their home to themselves, but it means a lot to me to know that if I ever needed them, they\u2019d be there without expecting to be paid for it. And knowing that\u2019s how they feel about me is one (of many) reason(s) that I\u2019ll be happy to be their support system when they need me.", "Weird when it's in parent house, not weird if you rent a house/ apartnment obviously.", "Nta, the insane thing about AITA is how many people are from the US and think it\u2019s a normal thing to kick your child out once they turn 18.
