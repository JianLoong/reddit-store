There was no violence other than yelling and my sister left. The next day she brought cops to get her stuff from her room. Now that doesn\u2019t sound like too big of a deal however this is where the real consequences come up. My mother is currently trying to foster my cousin who lives on the other side of the country. She is now in the final stages of the process. My cousin is in foster care because she lived in a car with her mom dad and severely autistic brother. Her brother kept running away and her parents (both obese diabetics mother is blind) can\u2019t control him so he got taken away by CPS and put in a home. Not too long after her mother gets sick and passes away due to low blood sugar and her dads refusal to go to the hospital. Her dad just disappeared off the planet and she ends up in foster care. My mom is the only other family she really even knows exists. There was no violence when she left. My mom said \u201cjust know you\u2019re always welcome back\u201d as my sister was leaving. Then brought the cops KNOWING my mom is trying to foster my cousin. I wanted to not attack my sister but just make sure she realizes that her actions to get revenge on my mom aren\u2019t just hurting my mom. \n\nI sent the following text \n\nI just want you to know that bringing the cops to moms house to get your stuff while she is trying to get (cousin) moved out of foster care is not only hurting mom it\u2019s hurting (cousin). If those cops have to file a statement of what happened and why they were there you\u2019ve ruined any chance of (cousin) moving in. (Cousin) will be sent off to live with a random family somewhere in the country that she doesn\u2019t know. She\u2019s been separated from her brother. Her mother just died and they can\u2019t find her dad. She literally has no one but mom at this point and you\u2019ve ruined that. At least tell me why you felt the need to call the cops \n\nI was a bit more harsh than I wanted to sound but this is the only way to get though my sisters head. Just laying the facts out and saying \u201cyou caused this\u201d my uncle and his wife have informed my mom that I sent an \u201cextremely rude\u201d text to my sister. Yes my uncles wife is involved in her adult niece and nephews texts between each other and comes at my mom who didn\u2019t even know I texted my sister.

I just would have taken a different approach and asked some questions.", "INFO: It feels like a lot is left out of this. What was the argument about? Is there a history of your mom being a bad parent? \n\nYou say there was nothing but yelling which means you had to be there to witness it.\n\nHaving to come in with cops is definitely an extreme reaction but it seems like she felt unsafe without them - so why is that?", "We will be needing an update on this\u2026have to know what happens.  NTA", "YTA your sister wanted protection, so she requested a civil standby with the cops. She has a right to her own safety. This brings up a lot of reasonable concerns about the safety of your mom's house that you are clearly ignoring/overlooking. I feel really bad for your cousin, but she deserves a safe and non-volatile situation, and it sounds like that might not be with your mom.", "YTA.\n\nYou didn't tell your sister about \"The real consequences of her actions\", you made up a story about what *could* happen if the police filed a report about something else that, as far as you're telling us, didn't happen. \n\nUnless your sister lied to the police, or your mother really did say something to make her legitimately feel unsafe, then there's no statement to be made by the police. You've given us no reason to think that the former is true.\n\nHonestly, I doubt that the cops decided to show up to babysit your sister as she moved out of your mom's house because the donut shop was closed for the day and they were bored. If your sister was just massively overreacting then they're probably as annoyed as you are if they showed up and saw that there was no serious reason for them to be there.", "Yta. You don't know your sister's relationship with your mom. You don't even sound open to knowing it.", "NTA she didn\u2019t think about her actions and she majorly fucked up", "ESH. Just because there was no violence doesn\u2019t mean your sister didn\u2019t have a reason to feel unsafe. Given the info you have provided I do think the cops was a bit of an overreaction. Your sister might have felt unsafe, and worried your mother would not let her collect her things. Just because someone isn\u2019t being physically abused doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t being abused. \n\nThe situation with your cousin sucks, and I hope her and her brother are able to find a safe and loving home, be it with your mother or not. But ultimately it is not your sister\u2019s job to sacrifice her safety and comfort.", "Not enough info\n\nYour text wasn\u2019t rude but I feel like there\u2019s way too much missing about the history between your mom and sister.", "NTA", "No, NTA. I wish I knew what she responded and if she at least felt remorse .", "YTA. She didn't feel safe getting her things without a police escort. She left with her mother yelling at her. You yourself admit it was *violent*.\n\nHer safety is her priority and that's how it should be.  \nShe's obviously having a hard time and you just piled on more.\n\nMaybe your mother isn't really qualified to foster tbh.", "YTA It doesnt seem like your sister's actions hurt your mom or cousin.

Having the cops escort you to get your stuff is extremely normal and common and we frequently encouraged it. I don\u2019t see how it would affect the mom\u2019s custody attempts since no charges are filed. \n\nI\u2019m not saying I think the sister was right to get the cops involved, but I can\u2019t see how it would affect anything.", "I can only speculate that it was she didn\u2019t feel safe because I haven\u2019t gotten an answer from even my uncle", "Not yelling as in screaming at the top of their lungs but constantly talking over each other and trying to talk louder than each other. I said yelling because my almost deaf grandma in the other room could hear it. I did not get involved as it never escalated more than that. My sister went to her room but this time came out with a bag and left", "I do not know. She has left a few times before and went to friends houses in the same way it happened this time. An argument turns into \u201cI\u2019m leaving\u201d and the next morning they talk it out and my sister comes home and it\u2019s good. This time she brought the cops. I can only assume it was about not feeling safe as she did not answer the question at the end of the text I sent", "I was there. It wasn\u2019t violent just raised voices like the trying to talk louder than the other person kind not screaming at the top of their lungs so I didn\u2019t get involved I just observed as it played out in the kitchen while I sat on the couch. I got home from work after the cops had got there but before they had left", "Obviously she had to tell the cops something serious other than just \u201ccome with me\u201d I just don\u2019t know what because the only thing that happened was yelling from both of them. Not screaming but trying to talk over each other and louder than each other. It\u2019s not made up because every call a cop takes has to have some paperwork. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a traffic stop or a shooting. There\u2019s paperwork of who\u2019s involved why they\u2019re there and what happened. CPS checks that stuff to make sure there isn\u2019t a history of domestic violence in the household. I was there I saw it all happen. If it got violent I would have intervened because it\u2019s never gotten physical before it\u2019s always just been yelling. One of my co workers used to do home inspections for CPS and when I told him about the cops he said since my mom was just in the routine check up phase of the foster care process that there was a possibility it wouldn\u2019t come up but if it did there\u2019s no way they\u2019ll let my cousin come live with my mom. So it isn\u2019t a guaranteed my cousin isn\u2019t moving in but even if she does there\u2019s a possibility it will come up on their system and it will be called into question", "My uncle and his wife offered to go with my sister but my sister said no that she wanted the cops. She didn\u2019t even want them to go with her she just wanted it to be her and the cops (Info from my uncle)", "She did not respond which is why I still don\u2019t even know why she brought the cops. I wanted to word it where it wouldn\u2019t make her feel angry but like you said feel remorse. I don\u2019t know if it worked because the only feed back I got was from my aunt", "See, I would speculate that she was being as dramatic as possible. No reason except she wanted to be the star of the show.", "Were there insults? Namecalling? Slurs?\n\nHas there been violence in the past?", "Cops will show up with a person (if requested) to make sure that they get all their belongings. It doesn't always have to be a violent incident. They would show up to make sure that no theft takes places during a moving out process. It's fairly common where I'm from. \n\nIf your sister has a habit of doing this type of thing as you've said, then this isn't far off from what she usually does.", "*You don't know what.* That's the only relevant piece of information here.", "Have you asked your sister why she wanted the cops there? Teenagers can be over-dramatic, but there could be a valid reason behind it.", "Never anything physical. There were privileges taken away like her phone. Last time any of my siblings got an ass whoopin was when I was like 10. Over the clothes with her hand which is why when I saw my sisters car and cop cars my heart immediately dropped", "I did in the last part of the text and I got no answer"]}
