Two years ago, my Dad ended up passing away due to cancer and he left me an inheritance, college funds and some jewelry who belonged to my grandma. One of the jewelry was a ring that my dad would\u2019ve given to me when I get married, so it\u2019s one of my most precious possession.\n\n\nMy Mom (49F) met her husband half a year after my Dad passing and got married just three weeks ago, so he\u2019s only coming to live with us now. When Darry started living here, all photos of my Dad were thrown into the attic and almost every part of the house who had traces of my father was erased. Two days ago, after coming back from school, I found out that my ring was missing and when I asked my stepdad, he told me he sold it since it\u2019s old and old fashioned.\n\n\nI cried a lot and my mom tried to buy another ring for me to replace it, but none of those models she chose was similar to my ring plus the emotional value was too great. I was just too angry, so in the middle of the night I went to their safe box and got his ring. Apparently this ring was one of the only inheritance he got from his mother after she passed away in Afghanistan. \n\n\nSo I have hidden his ring in a place where nobody knows and he freaked out. Darry asked me if I seen it, and I said it was sold since it\u2019s a old piece of metal. He had a mental breakdown asking me how could I do this and he\u2019s been crying in his room for a whole day and my mom called me childish and is giving me the cold shoulder.

Your stepdad's a real AH.\n\nI wonder if your stepdad actually sold it, or if he just took it to take away yet another memory of your dad.\n\nYou, however, didn't actually sell it.  You can sit down with them, return it and say, \"See how it feels to have your possessions stolen and sold out from under you?\"", "NTA.  If it was only two days ago - I'd consider contacting the police.  While you may be a minor, your step dad has no right to steal your possessions.  And it may be possible to track the ring back down.", "NTA.  Turnabout is fair play.  Who does this asshole think he is that he can take your treasures and dispose of them?  Stepdad is a total unmitigated ASSHOLE!!   Sorry for the anger.  This kind of shit pisses me off.", "How does he think you felt?!? NTA so long as you didn\u2019t actually sell it but now I would bring up the fact they should get it back from whoever because that\u2019s crazy and way out line. Your mom seems clouded with fear of being alone or something  since she\u2019s just no fucks about your guys heirloom", "So I\u2019m hella petty and I love this. I\u2019m gonna say NTA and not everyone sucks because you did not actually sell the ring. I think this is a great opportunity to bring it to him once he\u2019s cooled down a bit and express how much it hurt your feelings and broke your heart to lose something that represents so much more than the physical. He is entering your life and needs to respect the relationship you had with your father, as you do with his relationship with your mother. Where did he sell it, a pawn shop? Regardless, I know this may seem extreme, but if he doesn\u2019t help you get the ring back you can file a police report. Its against the law to have stolen goods, and this ring was stolen from you, and there is legal proof of this. \nFinally, I am so sorry this happened. I lost my dad this  year and I can\u2019t imagine finding out anyone had sold the (useless) things he gave me. You deserved so much better, and your mom is the real ass hole here for me.", "NTA, He deserves it, id actually sell it and cash in.", "In that case: NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou gave him a taste of his own medicine. Keep it that way.", "NTA.  Your stepdad is an AH. He sold it he can get it back.  Then and only then would I give his ring back.", "I'm gonna say NTA, mainly as Darry seems to be trying to completely erase your dad from your family history and that is just out of order.  Not saying I agree with what you did but I can understand why you did it.", "NTA, the real AH here is your mum for allowing this, she needs to move this boy on.", "Serves that asshole right. Smart move, OP. You are NTA and you managed to shine a light on his unbelievable assholery. What he did to you was unforgivable. I would keep that going a while longer if I were you, if not forever.", "Honestly i feel your pain, something similar happened to me, and honestly i would go into destruction mode if he started acting like he owned the place.\n\nNTA i would do the same probably to teach him ehat it feels like.", "NTA at all, he deserves what he got.", "NTA and you may need someone to protect the rest of your inheritance", "NTA. What is wrong with your mother? I feel so sad for you. Your dad dies from cancer and she only waits 6 months to meet her new husband and then moves him in with her grieving daughter where he proceeds to erase all traces of your Dad and steals an heirloom of yours to sell for profit. Shame on her for not kicking him out I don't care how lonely she is she needs to focus on protecting her daughter! I'm so sorry that you lost your father and that your mom is being a selfish ah by exposing you to this jerk she married.", "NTA. Your mom is a piece of work. Are you in touch with any of your dad's family who could help you with this situation?  Also if you can report him for theft do so. Your mom is going to wonder why she lost her daughter in a few years when you nope out of that situation.", "NTA. You did well. No harm, no foul.", "NTA, and I hope you pointed out that he did the same thing to you! That what he sold of yours was a priceless heirloom that you had treasured and you hope he feels as bad as he made you feel! Though obviously what he did was worse because he actually sold your ring.", "So, first off, I have to congratulate you on a level of petty that is really impressive. Now, my judgement is NTA simply because you haven\u2019t actually sold the ring. Had you sold it, it would have been E S H because to me two wrong\u2019s don\u2019t make a right. \n\nAs for what you should do next, I personally would tell him, you could get the ring back if/when he returns your ring to you. If he is unable to do that, then he just doesn\u2019t get his ring back until you\u2019re ready to give it to him.", "NTA", "Nta. I would call the police about your ring. And check pawn shops. This is theft and should not be tolerated.", "Eye for an eye", "Definitely NTA  \nYou really want to screw him over?\n\nPut your phone on record and place it in your pocket, start an argument with him, so he admits to selling the ring. Then go to the police station, play them the recording and report the item stolen. When you get home give him his ring back, thank him for incriminating himself, and tell him the police will be in touch. \n\nThen you can smile happily for the rest of the day, knowing you have won.  \n\n\nGood luck.", "NTA, but you should sell it.  If you don't sell it, you should throw it away.", "Imo NTA. As I read I thought you were going to sell you stepdad\u2019s ring which I would\u2019ve disagreed with because why go as low as he did. But the fact you just hid it to teach him a lesson was badass. \n\nAlso if you don\u2019t mind me asking what was your mum\u2019s relationship with your dad before he passed. The fact she was able to move on 6 Mo this later and proceeded to remove all his stuff from view in the house is strange. Like fair enough if she needs to move on but the fact she didn\u2019t consult you first to check whether you were ok with is is weird. If that was her way of moving on then that\u2019s her choice but it seems like she was forcing it upon you as well. But then again idk you guy\u2019s relationship so just speculating.\n\nBut your mum should also have had your back around the ring thing. The fact she didn\u2019t roast your stepdad for doing something so inconsiderate is shocking to me", "NTA  He sounds like a beaut.", "NTA, he 100% deserves that, if i were you, i really would sell it.", "This is petty but I\u2019m here for it. NTA.", "Ummm.... NTA. Maybe he will understand what it feels like to take away something that means something to someone. To be jealous of a dead person is rather sad. And its not like you actually did it.... so he can still have his stupid ring. Wow... people amaze me.", "NTA because you didn't sell it. You simply hid it.", "I would take the opportunity to pawn it", "NTA This is one situation where IDGAF, I\u2019d never give it back.", "NTA he did the exact same thing to you so I find it wild he's so upset. Obviously old jewelry should be sold asap, just as he's demonstrated. When he gives back your actual ring, he can have his mom's back.", "Good. Now tell him you might be able to look at \u201cbuying it back\u201d if he figures out how to get your ring back and \u201coh yes, returns a few special pictures of my childhood memories to the walls\u201d", "NTA\u2026but I\u2019d have it melted and repurposed into a ring dedicated to your father. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you. I\u2019d secure anything else of sentimental value, and save up to move out. You will never be respected there.", "I love your style. Try to negotiate, but keep it hidden. If he doesn\u2019t give your ring back, he doesn\u2019t get his ring back. NTA", "Someone does the same to him.\nStepdad: surprised Pikachu face.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nSale it. And if he wanna get legal then you can get legal also because not only did he steal from you, he sold it also. \n\nSale. IT. Or\n\nTell him to go buy back the ring and y\u2019all trade. Until then he ain\u2019t getting shit.", "A grown man crying because he got a taste of his own medicine? I wish there was a Justified Asshole flair. In lieu of that, NTA.", "NTA, actually go and sell his ring tho fuck him", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
