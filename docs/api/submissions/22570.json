I\u2019ll bet he won\u2019t do that again!", "Why do you care so much that you\u2019re hurt by what your teenage cousin thinks of your grooming choices?\n\nNTA for the Harry Gorilla clapback, if he wants to comment on your hair, you can do the same.\n\nYou are an AH for the \u201cno women will want a hairy partner\u201d thing though.  If you want to be smooth as a Barbie/Ken doll because you think it\u2019s attractive or you just like it or you\u2019re a competitive swimmer and that\u2019s common or whatever, that\u2019s fine, but you don\u2019t speak for all the women in the world.

A joke is fine but you carried it on with extra comments", "I\u2019d say you are kind of the TA, cause the comment you made back about him being a hairy gorilla, that made you even. You shouldn\u2019t have said anything more than that.", "You thinking that women are only into hairless dudes is insane lol", "ESH - Technically, he *is* a hairy ape, not gorilla. Measured by hair folicles per sq. inch of skin, humans are the hairiest of the apes.

ESPECIALLY on your part since you're the adult here.", "I think a better course of action would be to reiterate that it's your body, and you may do whatever makes you feel most comfortable with it, and also point out that's its weird that he has such a preoccupation with that. The \"no girl would want to be with you\" was unnecessary because you were obviously trying to make him feel insecure about his body because he did the same to you, but body shaming in retaliation to body shaming is not the way to go", "This isn\u2019t the end of the world sort of thing. He was an ass; you were an ass back. He\u2019s more younger than you. You both should know better. You took what he said personally and retaliated to hurt him. Not a lot of sympathy for him, but you were both asses.\n\nThis is literally the 2 wrongs don\u2019t make a right conversation about body hair.

He is a kid.", "Just wondering why your teenage cousin knows you wax your whole body? You\u2019ve talked to him about your privates? I mean while hair is a personal choice, lots of women shave/wax their legs. Lots of women don\u2019t have much arm hair either. \nAnd I think you are way too old to be saying that no one would want him because of his bodily hair. YTA", "YTA!\nYou are an adult and you insulted a kid initially. \nHe was wrong and you could have corrected him with wisdom and compassion, but instead you acted like an immature teenager yourself. \n\nYou should apologize to him and let him know that what you said was wrong. He could be hairy and still get someone who loves him. Also explain to him why you were offended by his comment and why he shouldn\u2019t talk like that.", "YTA, partly because of the age difference. Teenagers talk, you are an adult and don\u2019t have to feed into it. \n\nOn the hair front, I know lots of people who prefer men hairy.

He is an AH for saying no girl will ever want him. NTA for the hairy gorilla part. While one is just flipping an insult back, the other is a personal attack on the kid's psyche.
