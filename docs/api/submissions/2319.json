Now, for you I think you're an AH with how you're handling the situation and for calling your wife a thief. Her taking the meat was not right, and you getting the meat back was understandable.

If needed your wife shops with her sister as sorry but your money is to primarily feed kids. If sister starts buying wine, beer, etc then the budget you provide gets reduced. \n\nFamily should help family if they can but first the receiving family needs to do what is needed to help themselves.", "ESH - Let me explain. While I understand your frustration and after seeing everyone's comments, I have to say that I don't believe this is a situation that's easy to judge. Your wife is doing something kind and caring for y'all's family, regardless of who is related to who, but you are seeing it as though she's being taken advantage of. \n\nI don't believe we have enough information to provide the proper advice, but I noticed several red flags. \n\nFirst, admitted not fully knowing what the real and accurate picture of their finances looks like or if there is more to the situation. I came from a family that appeared wealthy but was not. For a couple of years, we didn't have enough resources. My mom raised my brother and me on her own, and through her job benefits and the help of a well-off uncle and aunt, we had nice vacations and occasionally nice things, like nice TVs, nice jackets, etc. She had a job with a fancy title and great benefits, but that paid rather badly. But it was all from a different source than my mom's income. In reality, we didn't have enough for everyone. There were days my mom went hungry or would cook things like \"potato fry soup,\" which was made from canned tomato soup and leftover fries from Mcdonald's. She truly did her best to make us feel secure and to hide signs of struggle, but I noticed when she didn't eat, and the overdue bills kept showing up. I mentioned this because it's hard to get the full and accurate picture sometimes, and when we stick to a \"you are taking from me\" attitude, it's hard to see behind the curtain. If you were my uncle and assumed because of the recent and relatively inexpensive trip we just had that, we did not deserve any help, I would be very sad. \n\nWhen it comes to the \u201cnice things\u201d poor people have, we often don\u2019t take the time to consider how they got them \u2013 and, more specifically, what they might have given up to have them. When we deny things of poor people based on the idea that poor people \u201cdon\u2019t deserve\u201d those things just by virtue of their financial situation, we\u2019re perpetuating classism. Our income, savings, and credit lines are not sums of our worth or capacity.   \nWhen we refuse to empathize and trust in people\u2019s stories, when we refuse to allow the poor to ask for help or call themselves as such, we perpetuate a status quo that makes the actual suffering of poor people invisible and worthless. Having nice things or taking a vacation doesn\u2019t change the realities of our lives. They just, in some way, might make those realities a little more survivable or liveable.  \n\r\r\n\nSecond, I don't think your wife is being clear or telling you the extent of her sister's struggles. Maybe for fear of lack of understanding or flexibility. However, taking food from your joint house and secretly giving it to her sister consistently is bold and telling. I'm certain that there is more to the story, maybe your BIL has a problem, and all the money is going toward therapy. Regardless, ultimately their finances are not your business. Someone is saying they need help, and your wife is responding. \n\nThird, while it's not your responsibility to help your SIL out, your wife feels like it's her responsibility to do so, and she's doing it regardless of your objections. As a married couple, your both need to support each other. By responding the way you did, you did not only paint yourself as the \"bad guy\" to your wife and now her extended family, including your nephews, but you also may have made your wife feel like she can't come to you to talk about this and that she lacks support. How isolating that must feel. Also, think about how you came across to the young kids who witnessed you taking back a gift your wife brought. \n\nFinally, I just wanted to leave you a piece of advice. Put your ego aside and maybe invite your wife and SIL for lunch to talk about what's going on and what kind of help they need without sounding judgmental. (I know, it's a hard thing to do). And see how you and your wife TOGETHER can help. She may open up to you, and you may see more50 and talk about which part belongs to her. If it was paid by you both, you also can't take full ownership of the meat or call her a thief. For this, and taking the meat back, you are an asshole. \n\nFinally, I just wanted to leave you a piece of advice. Put your ego aside and maybe invite your wife and SIL for lunch to talk about what's going on and what kind of help they need without sounding judgmental. (I know, it's a hard thing to do). And see how you and your wife TOGETHER can help. She may open up to you, and you may receive more insight into this difficult situation. It seems that there is a pattern of stubbornness and mistrust that needs to be broken. When we judge the poor at face value for their choices as consumers or invalidate their experiences based on their property, we\u2019re not taking the time to consider their motivations, and we\u2019re essentially implying that we don\u2019t trust they can make the right decisions for their own lives.\n\nTLDR: ESH - but your reaction was disproportionate, and YTA, if you don't apologize to your wife for calling her a thief and taking the food back.

Like having my card decline buying groceries, only putting $10 in gas in my car, worrying about car repairs. I would sit down and do a budget and \"find\" all this money we should have each month but there was always something that would come up. Once he and I split and had separate households, I never had my card decline, always filled my gas tank and did car maintenance.  My income, even with child support, is about half of what my ex was making.  My monthly expenses are actually more due to rent being higher and a car payment at a higher interest rate. Sometimes as a SAHM your hands are tied with finances and if BIL is living beyond their means, she might actually be struggling to put food on the table and not be able to say we shouldn't take a vacation because we need to budget better.  It could very much be a type of control with the BIL. My ex would always find a way to buy big presents for my boys or spring for a beach trip. But we never had savings and there was no thought for the future.

Husband spends thousands of dollars on a car for hill climb racing, with zero prize money, and had the hide to have his son beg friends on Facebook for money for firewood so they wouldn't freeze. A couple of years later their daughter puts a gofundme up because the parents were behind in rent and couldn't afford groceries.

Im sorry you\u2019ve went through those tough times, I can definitely relate in some areas.

So everything they had when they moved was from a basically prior life, they had hit rock bottom and fully deserved that Christmas hamper.", "Now we know how SIL and her family have been able to afford these vacations", "I think their point was that they paid 50/50 for the meat, but people don't always eat the same amount. If she eats one burger while OP eats two or if she eats two slices of roast while OP always eats three, she paid for half the food but doesn't eat half. So, she could theoretically give away that small excess and still have only given away what she paid for.\n\nThis would also be an EXTREMELY nitpicky way of looking at their finances.

Maybe in her mind she will not let those kids go hungry. I have done the same for my grown child who has several kids.

She's going about it in the wrong way, but so is he. This should've been discussed the first time the sister was having money problems and asked them for help. If they couldn't come to an agreement as a couple, the money/items shouldn't have been given from the family pot. Wife should've been more upfront about the cow. A reasonable compromise would be for the wife to pay 75% and give the sister part of the meat, or for the sister to pay for some of it instead of expecting a hand out, or for the husband to pay 100% to be in complete control of it.

But, OP, I think you need to sit down with your wife and go over the costs of their last few vacations, car payments, etc. Lay it all out in a practical way. Then ask her, why would these people be doing all of these expensive things and go hungry? Why wouldn't the husband work more? Why wouldn't the wife get a job?

Either way, your wife\u2019s an idiot. No offense. I wouldn\u2019t give pounds on top of pounds of the meat you bought to anyone. Beef is so goooooooooood.

I worry that she has fallen into a way of thinking - that he is being mean and not sharing even though he could, and she's heroically crusading to help her poor sister and the poor little hungry children. \n\nI wonder if it would help for a 3rd party to step in and help OP and wife communicate with each other because either the wife isn't listening to what OP is saying, or she isn't sharing some important information.", "Then the wife can buy the food herself out of her account", "i think this was the issue, she was using money from their joint account to support her sister, instead of money from her own account.

At the rate you paid or at a small markup, cuts of meat to be agreed upon by both parties?    \n\n\nYour wife would get lots of meat for cheap to give to her sister, and the funds would technically not be coming out of the communal budget.  You do lose some opportunity cost--the next time around, the cost of a whole cow might be more expensive.", "GOOD LORD\n\nI took a loan against my place to knock out credit card bills.

It would only take a parttime job for SIL to cover food costs..\n\nMaybe you need to have a sit down discussion with SIL & her husband and point out to them that you feel YOU and your wife are paying their car note\u2019s and funding their vacations, because otherwise they\u2019d be buying food with that money.

I was not making a lot of money and neither was my SO, but we were not hungry.  I found out about it after a few times and asked that we talk about it before we did anything else.  It still happened while I was at work.  After my SO became unemployed and I was the sole income, it was more noticeable, but we were still not hungry.  I started hearing about how the sibling was making purchases and spending money in ways that our household was not able, living with another family and not helping in that household.  There were some strong words and intense discussions, but after laying out the circumstances and timelines, my SO was able to see that the sibling was taking advantage of many people, including us.  The sibling sold food that was given to them (home canned to preserve a surplus)) in order to buy decorations and go to a restaurant with friends.  While we were all able to change our relationship dynamics, it took a fair amount of work and forgiveness on all three of us.  I never want to do it again, so I am very cautious.", "Excellent analogies and symbolism there lol, love it.", "I have zero sympathy for families with four children and a husband that is working 35 hours a week.  He can clearly find another job, but perhaps chooses not to.\nWhy would he bother, if free meat magically appears in the freezer.\n\nI think family get togethers are over for these 2 families.\n\nIt's a personality thing as well.  Some people wouldn't be phased about this, others like OP and myself would be pissed off."]}
