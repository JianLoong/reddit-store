Both of you paid for it, it is assumed that it was going to be used to feed YOUR family. OP's wife is free, of course, to help her sister, but she should not  force OP to do it too.

That meat is for you and your wife, not her sister\u2019s family. Your wife needs to stop bailing her sister out for being irresponsible with her money. Why isn\u2019t her husband working full time?

They want a lifestyle they can't afford and guilting your wife into helping supplement it. You need to have a more serious conversation with your wife. She's enabling them.", "NTA I would tell your wife that if she wants to pay for her sister\u2019s groceries than she should make separate grocery trips and use her own money, or just move in with her sister.

Dumb? Blind? How has she not questioned how and why her sister can afford vacations? If they\u2019re vacationing because your household is subsidizing their finances, your wife is a gullible idiot. I don\u2019t understand why she\u2019d give away hundreds of dollars to someone who can afford to travel. Clearly her sister prioritizes her lifestyle over her children eating.\n\nHonestly if your wife continues, I don\u2019t know if you can ever trust her to make a smart decision again", "Can\u2019t give a judgement on this one because everyone has made mistakes, but it\u2019s not the case that everyone sucks.

If you and your wife keep your finances seperate, she can finance their groceries out of her seperate finances. Also, how is your wife being blind to this? They can \"afford\" (which I highly doubt) to go on vacations but they can't afford food?", "NTA SIL and her family can afford holidays then they can afford to feed their children.

You don't get to be a SAHM or work only 35 hours/week or go on lavish vacation if you can't feed your kids. You are not responsible for feeding your sister-in-laws kids.

Especially with the holidays coming up! \nNext thing you know, your wife will have to provide all holiday meals plus gifts!", "ESH. \n\nyour sil and her husband are living well beyond their means and are financially irresponsible.

Well, not the kids.\n\nY'all are not acting like a partnership that a marriage is supposed to be. I've got no idea how desperate SIL's family really is, or how well off you are, but your relationship looks pretty broken.\n\nWife is TA for going behind your back to give food to her SIL.\n\nYou're TA for barging to SIL's house to take the beef. Sounds like you went prepared to enter if there was nobody home.", "Honestly? You and your wife are probably paying for SIL's mad money/get out fund.\n\nIf your funds are tight and you can't buy groceries, you might keep paying the note on that nice, newer car but you are not vacationing outside of the country.\n\nESH but you suck less than most. *If* SIL/family were actually in need, why did she donate prime cuts?\n\nI'd be tempted have an embarrassing discussion with BIL about vacationing when his wife begged a freezer full of meat because she said they were too poor to feed the kids.\n\n(If SIL needs the get out fund due to an abusive situation, she should have fessed up to OP when he took the meat back or to OP's wife later. OP would likely feel more generous if he knew it was a matter of safety. It is, perhaps, a question that should be asked directly before confronting BIL.)", "NTA. Divorce lawyer time. Your wife has repeatedly and consistently disrespected you and overruled your legitimate feelings of not wanting support a family of wasteful, irresponsible spenders. So, get rid of her.

Should she have talked to you about it? Absolutely. Could you have handled it better? Also absolutely. I think you guys should be able to sit down and figure out a compromise. Could SIL pay you a discounted amount for whatever groceries they need from you? I understand your frustration and to an extent it is absolutely justified.

I agree about going on expensive vacations and then whining about money, but your still TA", "ESH - and wow you two need to work on your relationship. She's sneaking food and going behind your back, you're yelling and storming into her sister's house to take the food back, neither of you are actually talking to each other or behaving remotely like grown adults, and you **need** to fix that STAT. \n\nHighly, highly recommend trying couples counseling. This conflict is exposing some serious rifts in your relationship and you two are clearly not working things out well on your own. You need to have an open conversation and you need help doing it.", "ESH.  You should have a joint checking account where you spend your shared money and a checking account for you and your wife.  She can buy her sister food with her money but not from the joint account.  \n\nWhere you are an AH, you were only entitled to half the cow, not the whole cow.  You should have figured out the math, kept your half, and then let your sister-in-law and wife argue over their portion.  \n\nI'm sure it will make you feel bad if your wife won't have any steak to eat while you enjoy yours, but that isn't my problem.  It's yours.\n\nP.S.  Get a couples therapist and work on your communication.

Yall need couples counselling it sounds like.", "YTA - you admit your wife helped to pay for the meat, I'm assuming from her own money, so what she does with it is up to her. \n\nAnd also - you the massive A for going over there with the intention to break into her home and rob her.  Which is what you would have done if they weren't home.", "Yta - she paid her half of the cow and deserves to do whatever she wants it.", "We have discussed it, we just didn't end up agreeing on a solution. \n\nYes she paid for half from our joint account, but when I cook dinner I cook for both of us. I wouldn't just cook for myself (deducting the amount of beef she gave away) so in effect I am subsidizing my SIL family.", ">  However, taking the food away was going to far.\n\nNormally I would agree, but he already had the conversation with his wife that this wasn't ok. & his wife tried to go behind his back and disregard his wishes.

Thats even better hahahaha", "They set boundaries in the past and wife walked right past them though.", "They have money for holidays and new cars but not for food?", "How many muscles did you pull reaching for that one?", "> Could SIL pay you a discounted amount for whatever groceries they need from you? \n\nOH HELL NO.

SIL answered the door and he took back what it is.", "They have money for vacations and new cars. Husband works 35 hours a week and wife is a SAHM. They're extremely irresponsible with money if they can do all the above and still not afford groceries.", "Yes if you pay for half you will be contributing to helping. Why do you think she doesn't need help and why does your wife think she she does? Are you fine with your wife so ending money that isn't in the joint account on her sister? \n\nYou mentioned that SIL and family went on a vacation. They paid for the vacation or was it paid for by someone else?", "lol\n\nJust anticipating the most likely objection to embarrassing BIL with the ongoing grift.\n\n(Edit: pretty sure \"likeliest\" isn't actually a word once I reread that.)", "Exactly. OP isn't a grocery store.", "Just because someone answers the door doesn't mean you can enter. Also the wife gave it to them, it's no longer his.", "Obviously not in both cases."]}
