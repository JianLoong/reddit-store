Now, for you I think you're an AH with how you're handling the situation and for calling your wife a thief. Her taking the meat was not right, and you getting the meat back was understandable.

If needed your wife shops with her sister as sorry but your money is to primarily feed kids. If sister starts buying wine, beer, etc then the budget you provide gets reduced. \n\nFamily should help family if they can but first the receiving family needs to do what is needed to help themselves.", "ESH - Let me explain. While I understand your frustration and after seeing everyone's comments, I have to say that I don't believe this is a situation that's easy to judge. Your wife is doing something kind and caring for y'all's family, regardless of who is related to who, but you are seeing it as though she's being taken advantage of. \n\nI don't believe we have enough information to provide the proper advice, but I noticed several red flags. \n\nFirst, admitted not fully knowing what the real and accurate picture of their finances looks like or if there is more to the situation. I came from a family that appeared wealthy but was not. For a couple of years, we didn't have enough resources. My mom raised my brother and me on her own, and through her job benefits and the help of a well-off uncle and aunt, we had nice vacations and occasionally nice things, like nice TVs, nice jackets, etc. She had a job with a fancy title and great benefits, but that paid rather badly. But it was all from a different source than my mom's income. In reality, we didn't have enough for everyone. There were days my mom went hungry or would cook things like \"potato fry soup,\" which was made from canned tomato soup and leftover fries from Mcdonald's. She truly did her best to make us feel secure and to hide signs of struggle, but I noticed when she didn't eat, and the overdue bills kept showing up. I mentioned this because it's hard to get the full and accurate picture sometimes, and when we stick to a \"you are taking from me\" attitude, it's hard to see behind the curtain. If you were my uncle and assumed because of the recent and relatively inexpensive trip we just had that, we did not deserve any help, I would be very sad. \n\nWhen it comes to the \u201cnice things\u201d poor people have, we often don\u2019t take the time to consider how they got them \u2013 and, more specifically, what they might have given up to have them. When we deny things of poor people based on the idea that poor people \u201cdon\u2019t deserve\u201d those things just by virtue of their financial situation, we\u2019re perpetuating classism. Our income, savings, and credit lines are not sums of our worth or capacity.   \nWhen we refuse to empathize and trust in people\u2019s stories, when we refuse to allow the poor to ask for help or call themselves as such, we perpetuate a status quo that makes the actual suffering of poor people invisible and worthless. Having nice things or taking a vacation doesn\u2019t change the realities of our lives. They just, in some way, might make those realities a little more survivable or liveable.  \n\r\r\n\nSecond, I don't think your wife is being clear or telling you the extent of her sister's struggles. Maybe for fear of lack of understanding or flexibility. However, taking food from your joint house and secretly giving it to her sister consistently is bold and telling. I'm certain that there is more to the story, maybe your BIL has a problem, and all the money is going toward therapy. Regardless, ultimately their finances are not your business. Someone is saying they need help, and your wife is responding. \n\nThird, while it's not your responsibility to help your SIL out, your wife feels like it's her responsibility to do so, and she's doing it regardless of your objections. As a married couple, your both need to support each other. By responding the way you did, you did not only paint yourself as the \"bad guy\" to your wife and now her extended family, including your nephews, but you also may have made your wife feel like she can't come to you to talk about this and that she lacks support. How isolating that must feel. Also, think about how you came across to the young kids who witnessed you taking back a gift your wife brought. \n\nFinally, I just wanted to leave you a piece of advice. Put your ego aside and maybe invite your wife and SIL for lunch to talk about what's going on and what kind of help they need without sounding judgmental. (I know, it's a hard thing to do). And see how you and your wife TOGETHER can help. She may open up to you, and you may see more50 and talk about which part belongs to her. If it was paid by you both, you also can't take full ownership of the meat or call her a thief. For this, and taking the meat back, you are an asshole. \n\nFinally, I just wanted to leave you a piece of advice. Put your ego aside and maybe invite your wife and SIL for lunch to talk about what's going on and what kind of help they need without sounding judgmental. (I know, it's a hard thing to do). And see how you and your wife TOGETHER can help. She may open up to you, and you may receive more insight into this difficult situation. It seems that there is a pattern of stubbornness and mistrust that needs to be broken. When we judge the poor at face value for their choices as consumers or invalidate their experiences based on their property, we\u2019re not taking the time to consider their motivations, and we\u2019re essentially implying that we don\u2019t trust they can make the right decisions for their own lives.\n\nTLDR: ESH - but your reaction was disproportionate, and YTA, if you don't apologize to your wife for calling her a thief and taking the food back.

But I do have a problem judging someone on food stamps for having designer shoes. \n\nBut yes, you're absolutely right, what I said is ridiculous considering the forum.", "She gave hundreds of bags to nonprof charities who help homeless and battered women, as well as women who have been displaced due to war, etc. Not EVERYONE is out to be an absolute dick. Whether the charity sells the items to support the women, or gives the designer items to the women in need doesn't matter. She carefully chose nonprof orgs that want to help people. \n\nNot everyone is a capitalist pig out to ruin people. There are a lot of people who just do help people.", "This is what occurred to me\u2026. She gave away her half\u2026\nBUT can\u2019t OP\u2019s wife see she is being played and taken advantage of?  I wonder if the sister\u2019s husband knows his wife is begging for food from OP\u2019s wife\u2026", "That was my thought,if she gives her half away,then she shouldn't eat any of his half to me,that's fair,She could go over to her sisters&eat her half there.", "Yeah and rent another apartment and start living in it matter of fact make OP's wife move in with his SIL.\nThis comment is just too ridiculous.", "Just split. Divorce and that's it. \n\nIf you are relatively newlyweds and are already having this kind of powerstruggle just end it before it gets worse. \n\nBoth of you are having a disgusting behaviour in my opinion. \n\nOP is an asshole should have sat his wife down and made it clear to her from the beginning without being rude about it. Explain that they don't actually need money as they just are bad at finance. Her helping isn't actually helping. Because eventually she will not be able to \"help\" and they'll just be in an even worse situation where they count on her to be a doormat. \n\nWife is an asshole because under no circumstances she was allowed to buy food with the shared account and after being told not to she found \"a way around it\" in some way. People pleasing much? Sacrificing your own marriage and relationship for her manipulative, guilt tripping sister? \n\nLike in my opinion this relationship is either in need of couples therapy to get over the trust issues caused by this instance, or a divorce. Based on how much the both of you want to accept you both fucked up and have to fix it. \n\nOP maybe you could try and have your wife seek a therapists help as she is clearly not seeing things straight and might need help understanding her sister is playing her hard. If that's not something you can do. I can see her not believing you as it seems like you don't like her sister very much (understandable all the same. I agree from your version she sounds like a manipulative person who tries to pity others into helping. Sort of like a drug addict minus the drugs.)", "I refuse to call him anything but that!", "A big joint purchase. I see what you did there. LOL", "Correct", "Exactly. Forget about dividing up the cost of the beef. How about SIL's family cutting back on the lifestyle expenditures. Fancy cars taking food out of their children's mouths?", "Some places I guess, most office jobs in my area are 8-5 with an hour lunch. So actually 40 hours working but 45 hours \u201cat work\u201d. Even more fun are the ones that have two mandatory 15 min breaks and make you start at 7:30. \ud83d\ude43", "I honestly think 35 hours a week on a single income, and regularly going on vacation is the dream! It would be a great idea for this guy if he could do all that and still afford to feed his family but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.", "Seeing as his wife brought up the fact she feels entitled to giving away half as she paid for half, he might as well not cook for her as by her own admission, she has forfeited her share of the meat.", "It's the Sam Vimes \"boots\" theory of economic inequality.", "^Me with shoes. All of my shoes cost $80 or more, which considering I only wear sneakers and boots, on the high side. But then I don't need new shoes for 5 years or more, but if I bought wsl art sneakers, I'd be replacing them every six months. \n\nAlso this is popularly known as the \"Sam Vimes theory of poverty,\" from the Discworld series. \n\nThe truth is most better off people hate when poor people don't appear miserable.

OP's SIL clearly isn't struggling that bad though.\n\ni don't begrudge a man for stealing a loaf of bread and a hunk of cheese to feed himself but if it's prime steak, pop tarts, a tub of ben and jerry's and a bottle of johnny walker then he's taking the piss (i've literally seen this)\n\nIt's the deception on OP's wife's part that i think is the main problem here\n\nI mean, who's going to turn down free Prime Rib?!", "Exactly! That's what I said. She is playing her sister so hard.", "But her half was the family half. If they both paid half, it essentially means it was from the joint account. That\u2019s the money she owes to support her family. She needs to pay for food from her own totally separate account if this is what she wants to do.", "he might be fine with it.  My uncle thought they were just getting what was owed when his wife pulled similar crap with my mom.", "This is sociopathic as hell dude.", "I don't say she is in the right in this Situation, but she didnt gave her half away. Only a part of it.", "Nta. You both already discussed it AFTER she already hid the fact that she was spending hundreds a month on your shared card behind your back. You agreed she'd pay for her sister's food with her own money, which is completely reasonable. The fact that their family takes vacations and then has to struggle to feed their kids is messed up and your wife needs to understand that her sister is sick for taking advantage like that. People that can't feed their kids on their own don't pay for vacations out of the country. Or anywhere really. I grew up very poor and now am comfortable so I find her sister to be a monster.", "NTA \n\nI think it\u2019s more than giving away groceries to her sister. \n\nYou need to have a sit-down with your wife so that she doesn\u2019t end up giving a big amount of money or something similar to her sister - she\u2019s just not seeing that her sister needs to manage her finances better (the sister most likely won\u2019t mend her ways because she knows she can mooch off her elder sister)", "doesn't matter that it was $500,then she should eat at her sisters", "So,she gives her's away to her mooching sister&then eats his when they agreed to pay half??", "They went in on it together, so it was a HOUSEHOLD PURCHASE. It doesnt have to be from the joint account to be considered for the house. She had no grounds to give that amount of stuff away to her sister when it was for the husband, wife and kids.", "But the cow was a joint purchase?", "Or they can stop going on international vacations", "Not a theory!

Being poor is expensive.", "Love that someone brought this up!", "I do. Regularly to charity, always working to help my fellow mankind. I also don't judge people for having nice things. I dunno how they got it and it doesn't matter. \n\nPoor people deserve comfort.", "Yes, we got on a tangent.\n\nRegarding the post, OP's wife is the problem, they need to go into counselling and develop some sort of system for whether or not they're going to help SIL's family, and if they are, how much and for how long. Wife cannot just do it arbitrarily unless she's doing it exclusively from her own pocket. \n\nI would turn down free prime rib. I was rather disgusted when OP said they bought a cow to chop. I'd rather just buy a cow to play with every day.", "Sounds to me like she gave away half of the family's food, of which she is 1/4.  So even if she didn't eat, the 3 of them will be splitting half the food.\n\nOP is NTA", "Depends on age of kids. Looking after kids is a job. It may not pay, but that doesn\u2019t mean it is not work. And 3 kids in child are (as I said, depending on age), might be more than would be affordable out of another pay check. \n\nSome,thing about SiL\u2019s dynamic feels off, and I\u2019m wondering if her husband isn\u2019t giving her access to enough money to pay for necessities.
