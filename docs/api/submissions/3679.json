It made your birthday fun and memorable.  Your initial assumption that this was for her not you may be off.

It sounds like this was a case of miscommunication and if their S/O said \u201cI\u2019m taking you salsa and swing dancing for your birthday\u201d they would have been more excited from the get go.

I\u2019m not a dancer and to make matters worse it was a little early in the morning to begin with. She definitely overreacted to my hesitancy.

Would she be ok with having her birthday as a fishing trip or whatever it is that you enjoy?", "[deleted]", "still you get a gift for the person, not for yourself. What if he hadn't liked it?

I like to see my friends and do something. For years he would give me the type of birthday that he likes (low key, no celebrating with friends, etc.) I finally told him that if he insisted on giving me the kind of birthday he wants, then I'm going to give him the kind of birthday I want and throw him a big party. That finally got it through his head that he should do what I like for my birthday and I should do what he likes for his. So I'm wondering if this might be the 2 of you celebrating each other the way you each want instead of what the other wants. Just something to consider for the future.

As a woman who dances salsa, that sort of attitude is why groping and harassment is often a problem. It's a partner dance that can be sensual if done well, but it's nothing even close to \"dry humping.\"", "I hope your right bro and may have needed to hear this. Like I said, we bump heads a ton when it comes to our POVs and failure to properly communicate but in the end we\u2019re able to resolve our differences and have a good time. This morning definitely didn\u2019t start out on a good note for us (on my birthday of all days).

I\u2019m definitely looking into taking more classes.", "I think it was a mixture of both lol.", "ew", "I love how this story ended", "Saw the edit, so glad you decided to go!\n\nMy reaction to your original post was that you're not an AH for being apprehensive to try something new, but unless you have some crippling stage fright or something well-known that makes you hate activities like dancing in public, you really, really should keep yourself open to new life experiences. \n\nAnd you had a blast. That never would have happened without this adventure. \n\nNAH.", "The operative term being \"she wanted\" rather than OP wanted, on HIS birthday.\n\nJesus Christ how tf is that N A H?", "Thank you! I did too \ud83d\ude0a!", "Thank you so much! I\u2019m so glad I took the leap!", "Or she is passionate about her hobbies and wants to share them with her partner as a bonding experience...?", "Or....maybe she could shift her passion to focus on her husband's passions, just for one day, his birthday. As a bonding experience.", "Yes, she could, I totally agree.\n\nBut using her passion as a jumping off point doesn't make her selfish. And as OP's edit states, he had a great time. It worked. \n\nNot sure why you're continuing to advocate she is selfish when she demonstrably brought her partner joy on his birthday."]}
