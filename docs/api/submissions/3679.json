OP is being perfectly reasonable to want to do something more to their liking on their birthday\n\nA generous reading of GFs actions is that she wanted to share something she thought would be fun and memorable with OP to start the day.  A more jaded take is that she was being opportunistic to pressure OP into doing this.  The truth may likely fall somewhere in between, but only OP can determine that and respond accordingly.  Us redditors are too far removed from the situation to assess that.", "NTA-But I\u2019m glad you were a good sport and went anyway and had a great time! Happy belated birthday \ud83c\udf82", "Nta, but I'm glad it worked out anyway. \n\nSounds like a fun couples thing, but it was what she wanted, so it would have either been good on *her* birthday or any other day of the year that wasn't your birthday.", "NTA but glad it turned out well for you.", "She wanted to cone up with something interesting and did.  It made your birthday fun and memorable.  Your initial assumption that this was for her not you may be off.  If you don\u2019t have many interests that the two of you share, she may simply want to broaden your perspective so there are fun things you both enjoy doing together.  Looks like she did s good job. \n\nHad she not come up with the idea, what would you have wanted her to do to celebrate?", "NTA.

Phew.", "NTA this gift was for her. Not you", "YTA for rejecting an opportunity to try something fun. Yes your gf got you a gift to introduce you to something she enjoys, and hopes to enjoy with you. If you had tried it before and hated it, she would be out of line.

Sounds like you don't actually want this person as a partner. She's doing something she likes (\"more than anything\") and wants to share with you for a part of the day. You've never done it; you might like it.

If my partner of more than 7 years randomly \"decided\" that I would \"suddenly like\" something he liked such as fking BALLROOM DANCING and wanted me to wake up \"early\" on my BIRTHDAY to pursue an interest I have NEVER expressed interest in, AT ALL, I would be miffed to say the least that he didn't take the time and effort into planning a surprise in LINE WITH MY CURRENT AND LONGSTANDING KNOWN INTERESTS.\n\n\"Worst case it's a fun morning\" Yeah sounds like a morning from hell to me. You talk about being single? I'd be having a serious conversation with myself about how I could perhaps be happier single than WITH someone that was so self-centered as to give HERSELF a gift on my birthday.\n\nJeeze.", "I think the gf is selfish af to decide upon a plan for the day that they know op isn't interested in, just because she likes it.
