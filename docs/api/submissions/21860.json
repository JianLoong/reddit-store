You need a pre-established maximum limit of days or weeks that guests are allowed to stay at your house and that limit should be respected at all times. Also, you would be perfectly justified in talking directly to your inlaws if your wife is not willing to do it for you. It's going to be a shitshow, for sure, but it's your house too and you should be allowed to have a say in this sort of thing. Your wife needs to see you're serious about this, otherwise she'll keep pushing you around and  forcing you to tolerate things you find unacceptable.  \n\n\nBest of luck!", "NTA 6 weeks is way too long.  Hell, 2 weeks is too long in my book.\n\n>She told me it's not too long and to just get over it.\n\nThat's an answer that would send me to a family lawyer.", "NTA.  One, yes, it's way too long.  Two, your wife clearly doesn't respect you.  It's ultimatum time, you just have to decide how far you're willing to go.", "NTA.\n\nI was going to say that if you agreed to six weeks, then you shouldn't complain now.  The time to say \"no\" was before it was agreed to.  But then she broke her promise about making it a shorter visit after last year.  I have a feeling you weren't given an honest chance to veto the visit.\n\nI get it.  My MIL just stayed with us for 4 months with her dog and cat, after selling her Florida house. After she got her new place, her sister visited her for 4 days.  And MIL complained TO US about how hard it was to have a house guest ***for 4 days!*** SMDH.\n\nEDIT to add:  If they won't leave, then you should seriously look into making a break of some kind for yourself.  Take your laptop to the library every day.  Or find a short-term office rental-- somehow get yourself out of the house.

Something really broke down between you and your wife that this even happened this way. It seemed like you had an agreement that any future stays would be shorter than 3 weeks, so how'd you end up with a 6-week visit? If your wife ignored or dismissed your feelings, or overrode you by deciding against your wishes to invite them for that long, she is the AH here. It's also not cool for her to tell you it's not that long and to just get over it; obviously she is not as bothered by them as you are but she should have more empathy for your position.\n\nWithout knowing the ins and outs of the agreement with them, I'm not sure if it is reasonable to ask them to leave early. It seems like it could really damage your relationship with them if it comes to that. BUT perhaps you can approach it gently and tactfully and they would agree it's better if they get a short-term rental or otherwise cut their visit short. Otherwise, unfortunately you may need to stick it out but then have a serious and frank talk with your wife. It is simply not ok for her to have ignored you.", "NTA.  This would be a hill to die on for me.  There is NO way I would have any houseguests for 6 weeks.  That is entirely TOO long.", "NTA- how did your agreement from last year get overrun? Did your wife unilaterally decide this with her parents and just not tell you? Is this part of a bigger pattern? \n\nFor the sake of your gig- I would look at your local resources to take your work laptop and spend some time getting work done elsewhere- coffee shops, libraries often have the capacity to reserve rooms. There are also some co-working spaces you can rent. I would want to be out of the house for the work day in order to focus.", "NTA \n\nYou guys agreed.

You and your wife need to discuss how long is too long to have house guests then stick to the time line. \n\nFull disclosure, my folks have moved within 45 minutes of us now and are always willing to babysit/dogsit whenever we ask.", "NTA- good lord I would K\\*\\*\\* someone if my IL stayed that long. Look into going somewhere yourself for a bit if your wife refuses to ask them to leave (Take your kid on a long weekend camping trip, or to the beach or pool).", "NTA\nMy dad and brother live 8 hours away. They used to come for like a week at a time for every holiday or visit. It drove my husband CRAZY because he is an introvert and they would just be in his space and he has no place to relax. Plus, his job makes him work most holidays, so he'd be extra stressed at work and come home to people who did not respect his space. But we talked about it, and I realized for his sanity, we had to limit their visits. So now we ask them to come for shorter stays. It helps so much when couples communicate and ensure family doesn't violate boundaries.", "YTA it is her house too. Deal with it.", "NTA.  6 weeks is too long for someone I actually like being around, nevermind someone I endure.", "ESH you should never have agreed to this. I WFH and I DESPISE it when people are in my house and I have to work. \n\nNext time say no. You knew three weeks was too long. Six weeks should have been a hard no. \n\nYour wife is an AH for asking and not respecting your need for privacy. \n\nYour in laws sound insufferable. No way in hell would they stay in my house. Hotel.", "Petty me says, if you get along with your parents, invite them for an 8 week winter visit!", "Some of the best advice I have ever received is figuring out how long you can stand to be around someone and then don\u2019t let it get too close to that amount of time.  \n\nWith that said, if you knew that 2-weeks was too much why was 6-weeks even an option?  NTA, but I would recommend working on setting boundaries and standing firm.", "NTA. \n\nTell your wife you're going to start renting a cabin in the woods for the duration of your in laws stays if they're visiting for more than a week or two.  \n\nShe can get them to help with the kid and all of the chores. Or she can enforce reasonable boundaries.", "3 days is about max.  I won't even stay with family longer than that, with years between.", "NTA, but your biggest problem is your wife. She just agrees to whatever your parents want, agrees to what you want and then blows it off to satisfy her parents. Her words and actions this year seem likely to happen EVERY SINGLE YEAR unless she gets (1) a backbone and (2) a different pecking order for whose needs she cares about more. I think couples counseling could make a difference.\n\nEven if couples counseling doesn't help your wife care more about the impact on your family than she does about catering to her parents, it can help you understand (1) the healthiest ways to deal with it and (2) what kind of partner you have in your wife.\n\n*It just occurred to me that that whole \"week with other friends\" thing was possibly your wife's suggestion for a way to overcome your objections. It just hit me that she may have colluded with her parents to trick you into saying yes! Ooooh, I hope not; but the bad vibes are there.*\n\nFor now, you may want to consider removing yourself from being at the house all day. Give those suggestions about the library a try, or stay in a hotel for a week. Then pursue that couples counseling. If the wife won't agree to it, please do go on your own. Your wife is not being a good life partner.", "NTA Your wife is an AH for not caring about you. Fish and visitors stink after 3 days. She and her parents are unreasonable. 6 weeks is mind-numbing. You cannot be expected to endure the co stand presence of such irritating behavior and still do your job properly.", "As far as I'm concerned, ONE week is too long for houseguests. This is why hotels exist.  NTA", "It is way too long.  But more to the point, it drives you crazy in your home and your wife doesn\u2019t care.  Straight to counseling. NTA", "NTA \n\nThey could be the most amazing guests that this world has ever seen and I\u2019d still want them out LOL 6 weeks is a long time for anyone.", "NTA - \"Guests, like fish, begin to smell after three days.\" - Benjamin Franklin\n\nHave this quote burned into a wooden sign and hang it over your front door.", "NTA-do exactly what she did. Invite your parents over for maybe 2-3 weeks. See if she likes it. I have no problem telling my spouse that his parents can stay one week max (as mine) but the child of said parents are responsible for taking care of them and catering to their needs. So his parents only stay 2 nights max.", "NTA. Your wife just goes along with whatever her parents want and disregards you in the house that is your home. It is not ok at all and the fact that the parents are oblivious to this sucks. Tell your wife to do something to shorten their stay or have them away for some time. If she fails to do so, tell her that you will have your parents stay over for as long as hers (if it's realistic). If that fails, be an adult: gather all 3 of them and say \"Hey, I love you but I am not enjoying this. You are always welcome here but it is too long for me so please next year, plan to stay 2 weeks in a row max.\"", "It's time to invite your parents for 6 weeks. Let your wife step in your shoes.", "Where are people reading all this extra stuff? I don't see any of that. I have noticed on several AITA people talking about things I do not see in the post.", "Comments made after the post and well after most top comments are already solidified by the time I see the post too", "Thank you.", "I'd have just kicked them out as soon as I was sick. Physically if necessary. It's your house, stand up for yourself. They're walking all over you because you let them. Your wife might complain but really she'll respect you far more, you come across as quite weak and timid. I've had to put my foot down with my in laws a number of times. They'll get over it.", "INFO - how did they end up staying for six weeks? Did your wife ask you?", "NTA, invite your parents for 6 weeks and note what your wife does.", "NP. If you get particularly curious about it you can go to the OP\u2019s profile and look at their comments. Doesn\u2019t always work though if they were deleted. Definitely depends on how invested you are. I usually am disappointed by the outcome. Some people on here though go back and find entire posts solidifying that the op is an asshole from other posts about the same situation in different subs. Depends how much you want to read about narcissists from their perspective most of the time.", "Tell her she\u2019s right, and you\u2019re inviting your parents for a 6 week stay\u2026", "NTA go stay in a hotel! Your wife does not care about your feelings at all. You set boundaries and she is crossing them horribly.", "NTA - 6 weeks is wild. My mom stayed with me at Christmas for two weeks and I was counting down every day after day 3. Thinking why in gods name did I agree to this. Never again", "My MiL stayed with us for a week while renovating her house. By day 4, I had started smoking again after giving up for almost 3 years. Took me another 10 to quit for good. I feel your pain. Hold out for the rest of the visit. Then you need to have a long, hard talk with your wife. The visit is too long. It's too frequent. Moreover, she is ignoring your feelings on the subject. I'd start with some boundaries about length and frequency. \n\nGood luck", "Op from now on you need your quiet for work and they need to book an Airbnb when they visit. NTA"]}
