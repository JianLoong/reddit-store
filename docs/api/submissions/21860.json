You need a pre-established maximum limit of days or weeks that guests are allowed to stay at your house and that limit should be respected at all times. Also, you would be perfectly justified in talking directly to your inlaws if your wife is not willing to do it for you. It's going to be a shitshow, for sure, but it's your house too and you should be allowed to have a say in this sort of thing. Your wife needs to see you're serious about this, otherwise she'll keep pushing you around and  forcing you to tolerate things you find unacceptable.  \n\n\nBest of luck!", "NTA 6 weeks is way too long.  Hell, 2 weeks is too long in my book.\n\n>She told me it's not too long and to just get over it.\n\nThat's an answer that would send me to a family lawyer.", "NTA.  One, yes, it's way too long.  Two, your wife clearly doesn't respect you.  It's ultimatum time, you just have to decide how far you're willing to go.", "NTA.\n\nI was going to say that if you agreed to six weeks, then you shouldn't complain now.  The time to say \"no\" was before it was agreed to.  But then she broke her promise about making it a shorter visit after last year.  I have a feeling you weren't given an honest chance to veto the visit.\n\nI get it.  My MIL just stayed with us for 4 months with her dog and cat, after selling her Florida house. After she got her new place, her sister visited her for 4 days.  And MIL complained TO US about how hard it was to have a house guest ***for 4 days!*** SMDH.\n\nEDIT to add:  If they won't leave, then you should seriously look into making a break of some kind for yourself.  Take your laptop to the library every day.  Or find a short-term office rental-- somehow get yourself out of the house. Or two weeks at a cheap hotel, whether you sleep there or not.", "NTA, like fish company is only good for 3 days.

Something really broke down between you and your wife that this even happened this way. It seemed like you had an agreement that any future stays would be shorter than 3 weeks, so how'd you end up with a 6-week visit? If your wife ignored or dismissed your feelings, or overrode you by deciding against your wishes to invite them for that long, she is the AH here. It's also not cool for her to tell you it's not that long and to just get over it; obviously she is not as bothered by them as you are but she should have more empathy for your position.\n\nWithout knowing the ins and outs of the agreement with them, I'm not sure if it is reasonable to ask them to leave early. It seems like it could really damage your relationship with them if it comes to that. BUT perhaps you can approach it gently and tactfully and they would agree it's better if they get a short-term rental or otherwise cut their visit short. Otherwise, unfortunately you may need to stick it out but then have a serious and frank talk with your wife. It is simply not ok for her to have ignored you.", "NTA.  This would be a hill to die on for me.  There is NO way I would have any houseguests for 6 weeks.  That is entirely TOO long.", "NTA- how did your agreement from last year get overrun? Did your wife unilaterally decide this with her parents and just not tell you? Is this part of a bigger pattern? \n\nFor the sake of your gig- I would look at your local resources to take your work laptop and spend some time getting work done elsewhere- coffee shops, libraries often have the capacity to reserve rooms. There are also some co-working spaces you can rent. I would want to be out of the house for the work day in order to focus.", "NTA \n\nYou guys agreed. Now it\u2019s double the time. \n\nDang", "NTA - My Nana had an old magnet on her fridge that said \u201cguests and fish stink after 3 DAYS (edit: sorry for typo earlier lol NOT MONTHS!).

My dude, how'd your wife sucker you into agreeing to THAT?
