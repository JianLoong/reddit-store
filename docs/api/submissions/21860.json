But your wife kind of is. She's completely disregarding your feelings. Is she like this with everything else in your life? Maybe you should go get a hotel room and let her deal with her parents. You could even take your4 year old.", "NTA. Tell her that from here on out, they can stay at a maximum 2 weeks and there needs to be a minimum of 4 months in between stays.", "NTA based mostly on 3 things   \n\n\n>I talked with my wife and she half-understood my perspective and we agreed that they would not stay with us for so long if it happened again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>There is a snowballs chance in hell my wife would be as accommodating as I am if it were my parents staying with us for this long.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>She told me it's not too long and to just get over it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour wife is the asshole in this situation and you should make a big fucking deal about this to ensure this sort of shit never happens again. You need a pre-established maximum limit of days or weeks that guests are allowed to stay at your house and that limit should be respected at all times. Also, you would be perfectly justified in talking directly to your inlaws if your wife is not willing to do it for you. It's going to be a shitshow, for sure, but it's your house too and you should be allowed to have a say in this sort of thing. Your wife needs to see you're serious about this, otherwise she'll keep pushing you around and  forcing you to tolerate things you find unacceptable.  \n\n\nBest of luck!", "NTA 6 weeks is way too long.  Hell, 2 weeks is too long in my book.\n\n>She told me it's not too long and to just get over it.\n\nThat's an answer that would send me to a family lawyer.", "NTA.  One, yes, it's way too long.  Two, your wife clearly doesn't respect you.  It's ultimatum time, you just have to decide how far you're willing to go.", "NTA.\n\nI was going to say that if you agreed to six weeks, then you shouldn't complain now.  The time to say \"no\" was before it was agreed to.  But then she broke her promise about making it a shorter visit after last year.  I have a feeling you weren't given an honest chance to veto the visit.\n\nI get it.  My MIL just stayed with us for 4 months with her dog and cat, after selling her Florida house. After she got her new place, her sister visited her for 4 days.  And MIL complained TO US about how hard it was to have a house guest ***for 4 days!*** SMDH.\n\nEDIT to add:  If they won't leave, then you should seriously look into making a break of some kind for yourself.  Take your laptop to the library every day.  Or find a short-term office rental-- somehow get yourself out of the house. Or two weeks at a cheap hotel, whether you sleep there or not.", "NTA, like fish company is only good for 3 days. Is your wife not around all day, how does she not see this.", "You made an agreement with your wife. She\u2019s gone back on that agreement. Time to remind her of it and find your in laws an Airbnb where they can whine to their hearts content. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Something really broke down between you and your wife that this even happened this way. It seemed like you had an agreement that any future stays would be shorter than 3 weeks, so how'd you end up with a 6-week visit? If your wife ignored or dismissed your feelings, or overrode you by deciding against your wishes to invite them for that long, she is the AH here. It's also not cool for her to tell you it's not that long and to just get over it; obviously she is not as bothered by them as you are but she should have more empathy for your position.\n\nWithout knowing the ins and outs of the agreement with them, I'm not sure if it is reasonable to ask them to leave early. It seems like it could really damage your relationship with them if it comes to that. BUT perhaps you can approach it gently and tactfully and they would agree it's better if they get a short-term rental or otherwise cut their visit short. Otherwise, unfortunately you may need to stick it out but then have a serious and frank talk with your wife. It is simply not ok for her to have ignored you.", "NTA.  This would be a hill to die on for me.  There is NO way I would have any houseguests for 6 weeks.  That is entirely TOO long.", "NTA- how did your agreement from last year get overrun? Did your wife unilaterally decide this with her parents and just not tell you? Is this part of a bigger pattern? \n\nFor the sake of your gig- I would look at your local resources to take your work laptop and spend some time getting work done elsewhere- coffee shops, libraries often have the capacity to reserve rooms. There are also some co-working spaces you can rent. I would want to be out of the house for the work day in order to focus.", "NTA \n\nYou guys agreed. Now it\u2019s double the time. \n\nDang", "NTA - My Nana had an old magnet on her fridge that said \u201cguests and fish stink after 3 months. In New England in summer they should be able to find a cute air bnb for a couple weeks or monthly rental close enough to enjoy their grandchild but far enough to maintain your sanity.", "Woah.  6 weeks?? My dude, how'd your wife sucker you into agreeing to THAT? My husband and I always agree on the amount of time our folks visit beforehand--so did the in-laws tell y'all the duration of their stay last minute or once the arrived ? \n\nNot sure how to vote this one (leaning hard toward NTA) until I know more of the details.  You went from 3 weeks last year to 6 weeks this year....were you even asked if this would be okay?", "ESH. There's no \"too long for houseguests\" it's just how long you and your wife personally like. You agreed to less than 3 weeks last time.\n\n> fast forward a year and here we are, 3 weeks into a 6 week stay and I'm beginning to lose my mind.\n\nHow does that just happen? If you didn't want them to stay 6 weeks you should've put your foot down before they got there.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You miss represented what happened in your post. Frankly this is ESH post.\n\nYOU AGREED TO LET THEM STAY WITH FOR FIVE WEEKS.\n\nOP you can't cry about how awful things are...and the turn around and agree to let them stay again and for even longer!! That's YOUR mistake. No wonder your wife told you to suck it up. You agreed to this!! \n\nWorking from home makes it harder to have time away from them. I suggest taking your kids and doing a stay-cation at a local hotel for the weekend to give yourself a break from your in-laws .\n\nAnd from now on... STOP AGREEING TO LET THEM COME FOR WEEKS AT A TIME. Why act like a doormat then get all passive aggressive after the fact!?! This is your own doing..... Stop blaming your wife and own up to your mistake.\n\nAlso when the other family stay fell through.... You should have told them that the break was necessary and your sorry but you cannot accommodate them during that week. And provided a list of nearby hotels and travel spots for them to go to.", "NTA. A week, maybe two if you were on good terms, but 6? NO!  This type of boundary smashing is divorce territory.  NO ONE should be okaying guests without BOTH spouse's in agreement. You had an agreement with your wife, she did NOT honor the agreement, and then tells you to get over it? Nope. Time to show her the yellow card.", "OP is the ahole here too. He left out info on the post. He agreed to let them stay with them for six weeks!!  If they are so horrible and 3 weeks was too long...you should have never agreed to 6 weeks... He made the mistake and is now crying about it.

You got played, they lied to you, your wife was in on it and doesn\u2019t respect your opinion on who stays in your home or how long they stay. A good guest stays 4 nights max and is on a plane or in a hotel after that. Your in-laws are bad guests, and your wife is enabling them"]}
