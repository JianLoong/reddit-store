It\u2019s definitely easier for your selfish, lazy brother, and it\u2019s easier for mom because she doesn\u2019t have to step up and make your lazy brother either do his part, or take care of himself. But it is not easier for *you*. Your brother is an adult, he can feed himself. If he wants to eat takeout every night, that\u2019s his business, you are obviously capable of making your own meals.  An arrangement where you cook for yourself and freeze portions for later, and he figures out his own meals, seems very reasonable. The only reason it\u2019s a problem is because your brother is whining about it.\n\nYour mom needs to tell your brother to quit acting like a child and expecting you to take care of him. If he wants the two of you to share meals, then when it is *his* turn to handle dinner he either cooks an actual meal, or he pays for takeout, for both of you. For now, since your mom\u2019s only issue is that the two of you are fighting, just stop arguing with him about it. Refuse to engage on the subject. If it comes up, tell your mom \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to share dinner duties, so I cook for myself, and so does he. I don\u2019t see the issue.

That's some bullshit. The specific nature of the chore isn't even relevant. This is a chore that must be done every day, at least in terms of eating dinner. Ordering takeout every day is a fast track to being someone that's broke their entire life and spends all day complaining on the internet. Your brother needs to either pull his weight or compensate you for cooking every day.\n\nIncidentally, it's a little indicative of a messed up household if your mom isn't around enough to cook dinner for her 21 year old son, and they both think the solution is for the 16 year old daughter to shoulder that responsibility. Shouldn't the adult 21 year old be the person stepping up?", "NTA.  If he's too lazy to cook, why shouldn't he pay you to do it?  He can pay you the amount he's spending on take out.  Next thing, he'll be expecting you to feed him because he's too lazy to shovel the food into his own mouth.\n\nMy brother started learning to cook at age 12.  Now he and his wife decide who's cooking when based on their schedules.  I won't even consider dating a guy who doesn't know how to cook.

He's already doing less chores because 'college is harder than high school so that's fair'.", "He might have more disposable income but not limitless. He can\u2019t afford to order take outs even for himself alone three times a week, so his plan was to wear you down financially until you cooked for both.

He's the older one and is responsible for his minor sister. He has money and you don't. He needs to step up and either help you out or be on his own. Sounds like your mother is enabling this behavior. She needs to be the adult and tell him that if he wants to live under her roof he will have to work with you as a team. You are not his servant. \nI have a suggestion. After dinner when he refuses to clean up all  you have to do is ask him:  \"are you really that helpless?\" He'll get mad but what you say will stick with him.
