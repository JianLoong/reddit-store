I am so sorry for your loss. Naming a child after a deceased loved one can be a beautiful tribute, but it should always be done with open communication and consent from the family members. Your sister should have considered your feelings and asked for your approval first. It is completely understandable for you to be devastated by this, and your reaction is valid. Your sister should have been more considerate and respectful of your grief.", "NTA - It obvious that you have a connection to that name so it\u2019s understandable that you haven\u2019t spoken to her yet", "NTA \n\nBeyond insensitive from your sister. I'm sorry for your loss.", "ESH, she is for hiding it and not at least telling you about it and you are for thinking that you could forbide someone from using a name.", "NTA- the fact that she didn\u2019t warn you ahead of time is very cold. Of course no one owns a name, especially if it has meaning in yours or BIL family. \n\nBut what a gut punch to hear, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be painful to watch another little boy growing up being called the same name. She should have at least told you in private.", "Honestly I'm going to go with ESH. She absolutely should have asked you, but the silent treatment is abusive so that makes you an asshole too. Did she do it in a clumsy way to honor your son and thought it would bring you closer? Bring you comfort? Was it done as a sign of respect for you and your son? Or do you genuinely think this woman was trying to spite you and be cruel? If it's the latter, you are of course right to distance yourself from the situation. But if she was trying to do something loving and just went about it the wrong way, look, you shouldn't abuse her over a gesture gone wrong. What's done is done and you owe her an apology for the silent treatment if her intentions were good. I am so sorry about your loss and if you're not seeking professional help, I hope you can do so because you deserve support and health and as much peace in your life as you can cling to. So sorry for your loss and I hope you find a way to make peace with the child's name.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Thats insensitive and selfish, even if she meant it as a tribute. She should have asked you first. Im so sorry", "NTA\nShe should\u2019ve asked you first. I understand if it was a middle name and that\u2019s what people usually do to honor someone but the first name is too much without consulting the mother. I hope she realizes this and apologized to you. Try expressing your feelings and hopefully she\u2019ll understand", "ESH. \n\nYour sister should have spoken to you first. But in your additional info you call this a \"personal attack\" when it sounds more like she was honoring your son. Your reaction to never speak to her again is only going to hurt you. Are you okay with not being invited to family events or holidays because you won't speak to your sister?", "NTA", "She should have done the middle name if she was trying to do it as a gesture. First name is too painful and constant reminder.", "NTA.\n\nIf she had asked you and you had approved the use of your son\u2019s name, it would have been an honor and a sweet gesture.\n\nShe didn\u2019t ask, she didn\u2019t tell you she was thinking of doing this, you didn\u2019t give your approval, so she is not honoring your son\u2019s memory with a sweet gesture.", "NTA this was a very misguided gesture of love that I\u2019m sure is incredibly painful for you. Your sister will have to figure out how to navigate that.", "NTA. This is the rare instance in which I think people have the right to veto or say \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t name your kid that.\u201d  \n\nI\u2019m all for people naming their kid whatever they want. But holy crap. When a close relative has passed or lost a loved one, have the common decency to ask. Because you could very well be bringing up traumatic events.", "YTA, giving a Baby the name of your Son is the highest compliment that anyone can pay to your child's memory. why do you see it in such a negative way?", "NTA\n\nIf it was a tribute, which it could be, he was your son and her nephew. But even if that was done in the most loving memory, she should have communicated with you. \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss and the callousness of your sister.", "NTA. You have strong  feelings about the name so it's understandable your are affected by this. She should have spoken to you about it first.", "YTA - you think she did that to hurt you? It\u2019s to honour your child . My brother passed away , all 4 nephews have his name either as a middle name or first name.  You went NC to your sister for that? Wow", "NTA - i could believe your sister meant it as a sweet gesture and theoretically i can even see someone appreciating it, but holy shit. not consulting you about it is absolutely insane, callous and outright unacceptable, in every way. \n\nshe better fucking grovel on her hands and knees/literally change the name, paperwork be damned.", "YTA you don\u2019t own a name. My sister did the same and I didn\u2019t care.", "Nta at all. That's a wild thing to do without consulting.", "NTA your sister knew you would not agree. She knew this would cause you issues. \n\nWhat she did was cruel and deliberate!", " didn't forbid anyone. Just devastated and reevaluating the relationship, because it's a horrible thing to do\n\nIt's not forbidding something to simply stop speaking to someone because they behaved cruelly", "It's cruel.\n\nAsking them to hear the name in the context of family, asking the whole family to detach the name from most strongly associated with the child who died, talking about Dead Child's name as baby and then as getting milestones theirs never gets. \n\nThis isn't a grandparent who lives a long life. This was a child who only had so many things. Viciously taking this from a sibling who buried a child is disgusting.", "If it was a compliment why did sis warn her or ask her? Instead she just dropped a bombshell on a woman who will be for ever grieving a little boy with the same name as her nephew as he grows up and gets to do the things her son never will.", "It's wild how many people are so wounded they see this as an attack instead of as a tribute. Wow! I personally never would have done something like this at all, let alone without asking, but seeing it is a hateful thing instead of loving tribute is something I'm having trouble getting my mind around"]}
