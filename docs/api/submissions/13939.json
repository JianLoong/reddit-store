{"id": 13939, "submission_id": "12b0vp0", "title": "AITA FOR LAUGHING AT MY STEPSISTER", "selftext": "So a little back story my mom 55 and dad 57 got a divorce when me 30m and my twin brother 30 were 13 due to our dad having an affair with our stepmom 47 and got her pregnant with our half sister. After the divorce my dad married his wife( who was horrible to our mom and it got worse when she realized that we were never going see her as a mom in our lives) and they had 3 more children and my stepmom had 3 daughters already. Their father had died 2 years before the affair so they were excited to have a new dad. \n\nDuring the divorce my paternal grandparents were not happy about the affair and did everything to make sure my father and his new family knew they were not welcome. They were not openly hostile but it was obvious when it was noticeable when we would get things that they wouldn\u2019t of get invited to things they weren\u2019t.\n\nSo on to the reason for this post. My grandparents (dad\u2019s parents) are wealthy, think old money. In their family there is a tradition that when you get married you and your spouse are gifted a set of jewelry to pass down to your children. When I married my husband we were both gifted 2 sets of diamond cuff links and a part of diamond studs all together worth about $200k. They also payed to have built our house built when they found out we were expecting our own set of twins via surrogate. I know spoiled. \nNow my twin is getting married to his long time girlfriend. My grandparents are paying for their wedding ( they offered to pay for mine too but my husband\u2019s parents paid for it so that\u2019s why they built the house). My oldest stepsister 28 is also engaged and her wedding is scheduled after my twins. She and her fianc\u00e9 aren\u2019t as well off but my dad is paying but not as much because he\u2019s still got to take care of our younger siblings and my stepmom is a stay at home mom.\n\nHere\u2019s where I might be the AH. We were having dinner with my dad\u2019s family and you could tell my stepsister and stepmom was upset about something. My youngest brother asked her what was wrong and that\u2019s when she got upset. Apparently she had asked my grandparents the color of the jewelry she was getting for her wedding. \n\nNow they don\u2019t have a relationship with her and our other 2 stepsisters and do not think kindly of their mother. They\u2019re only around them when it\u2019s a big family event or something for my half siblings. \nSo they told her she wasn\u2019t getting anything like that especially how she behaved when the affair came out and she made it seem like me and my brother should\u2019ve chose her mother over ours which was not happening. So she also asked about money for a house because again my father can\u2019t afford it. Again they said no so her feelings were hurt. Plus they\u2019re not even going to her wedding.\nI couldn\u2019t hold it in so I laughed and so did my brother. Later after dinner my dad text us saying we were AHs which I can see it. \nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1680562307, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12b0vp0/aita_for_laughing_at_my_stepsister/", "score": 182, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even at 13 you should have recognized that step mom\u2019s kids and your half siblings have ZERO to be blamed. You have allowed your snobbery to grow. \n3. GP are TAs.

Are the surrogate children of your \"blood\" or your husband's?  Will they be disregarded if they only carry your husband's blood?", "Holy moly!!! That is so nice of them!! Honestly I'm amazed that you have lasted this long without laughing in their face", "Those are my children from before I met my husband. He adopted them when we got married", "The children are hers, the husband adopted them.  \n\nSo they are the grandparents great grandchildren.", "Those are OP\u2019s children that the husband adopted- the children are blood related to OP\u2019s grandparents.", "Our oldest 2 are my biological children from before I met my husband. Their mom had died when she gave birth to my second son. He adopted them when we got married. Our twins are my husbands blood children. No they won\u2019t be excluded they have trusts like all my children. Plus my husband comes from old Italian money so even if they were excluded from my grandparents estate they would be okay. My two oldest kids will receive money from my husbands parents and grandparents too.", "Just because I\u2019m intrigued, so you had a female partner and had twins or did she pass when she gave birth to your second baby? I\u2019m sorry for your loss also and I don\u2019t mean to come off rude if I do! I just have a lot of questions out of curiosity! What I\u2019m really curious about is if it\u2019s your sperm for the surrogate? I only ask because my gosh what are the odds of two sets of twins?! Congratulations to you and your husband!! I have twins in my family! \ud83d\ude0a", "I\u2019m a man", "What actions ?\n\nWhat did the stepsister do ?", "She passed away after our second son was born from complications from the pregnancy and prior health issues. You don\u2019t have to apologize, she was a great person and mother she actually recorded videos for our sons each year until they are both 21 and her family is still involved with them plus they love my husband as a father for them and a spouse for me.", "Sorry didn't realise.", "Oh a lot she was hostile to my mom from about the time my dad moved in with them up until my wedding in 2016. She would constantly say me and my brother should cut our mom out and see her mom as ours. We never did because we saw firsthand what the affair did to my mom. Then when my grandparents tried to build a connection with her and the other 2 girls the first thing she said to them was how much money they should be giving to her instead of my aunt who was going through cancer treatment at the time. Then right before my wedding happened where she confronted my in-laws in front of my grandparents about how they shouldn\u2019t be supporting me because her mom was only a guest wasn\u2019t included in the wedding like my mom. Then told my granddad it was a stupid idea to have my house built for me because I should have to go through the struggle of buying my own home because I\u2019m an adult it will build character for my children to watch me struggle. Which would never happen because my in-laws and my husband\u2019s family come from old Italian money from like the 15th century.", "From a stranger to you, that makes my heart so happy to hear! I love that her family is so accepting of your husband! \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c", "Wow she is a piece of work.     \n\nShe should have stopped being a smug know it all.   \n\nShe should have stuck with adjective Speak good or remain Silent.", "Hmmm. Why does the term \"golddigger\" keep going through my head?", "Her mom actually introduced him to me. My former in-laws are the best people.", "Idk why either. The crazy thing is my dad knew how is parents felt about infidelity. He knew he had a lot to lose like his inheritance be literally sliced in half. Which they did imagine going from a high 8 figure inheritance to a low not even half a million inheritance plus all the properties he was to get. All of the properties except 2 random three bedroom beach houses in Massachusetts were allocated to me and my brother . My half siblings will probably get more than him when the time comes."]}
