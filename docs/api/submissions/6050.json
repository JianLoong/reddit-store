It\u2019s a 4 bedroom house. The master, on the first floor, is mine. Upstairs the other three, one is C\u2019s, the other is M's (28M), and the fourth is meant to be a guest bedroom - but it is currently used as storage by C n M. I\u2019m currently overseas, but I\u2019m still paying my share of the rent, which is $400 more per month than what they pay.\n\nNone of the bedroom doors have locks. This has caused incidents, like when C was hosting a party the night before I had an early start for work, and her drunk friend entered my room at 3AM, and stood at the foot of my bed for about 30 seconds. This scared me and made me feel like I had no privacy in my own space, and I was not able to sleep.\n\nBased on that and knowing that C was hosting holiday get-togethers, I wanted to ensure my stuff and my bedroom were untouched while overseas. I initially wanted to get a lock for the door, but there were no rental-friendly options. So instead, I bought a security camera and set it up on a shelf in my room.\n\nNot even a couple hours after I left for the airport, my camera picked up activity. Both roommates came in, M seemed to be looking for something while disorganizing my stuff; C was behind him fixing what he touched. The day after, C entered my room, went to the bathroom, and took my hair dryer. Messaged me later asking if she could borrow it.\n\nThey did not notice the camera until days later when C had to let an electrician into my bedroom and saw it. C asked me about it, and \"jokingly,\" said I lacked trust. I told her I had turned it on that day. Days later, C\u2019s mum entered to my room, looked around, and left.\n\nI was aware that C\u2019s family was coming over, today she asked if her friends (two adults and their kid) could stay in my bedroom. Told me the lady has back problems and is pregnant, so she offered the master to not make her go upstairs.\n\nI made it clear that it makes me uncomfortable to have strangers sleep in my bedroom. However, they could stay under my conditions: My bedding cannot be used, everything has to be left as it was, and the camera is to be kept on.\n\nShe was fine with the first two but told me the camera was too extreme. I explained that the camera was there for my own peace of mind, as I have my WFH equipment and valuable things that I want to make sure remain untouched. \n\nShe said that the camera was creepy and felt uneasy since finding out about it. She also said it shows that I have no trust in her or M and assured me that they have NEVER entered my room without my permission. Eventually told me that she \u201callows me\" to keep the camera on, but she is still arguing with me through texts.\n\nI\u2019ve seen through the camera that she is getting my room ready.\n\nSo, AITA for setting up a camera in my bedroom and refusing to turn it off while my roommate's guests stay there?", "created_utc": 1672441652, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zzeg5h/aita_for_refusing_to_turn_off_the_camera_in_my/", "score": 182, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I said that it made me feel uncomfortable and would rather no one stay in my room, but if necessary it had to be under my conditions. Admitattively, I was hoping they would say no because of my conditions, so I might be the asshole for not saying no straight away (I hate conflict).", "Its the master so probably has a bathroom.
