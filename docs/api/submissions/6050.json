This only became a HUGE problem with me when she got a dog without asking me first (we weren't even allowed to have pets in that apartment) and her dog would get into my room and shred everything I owned and pee on my floor. He also tore up the entire common area of the apartment and nearly got us evicted when she left him at home when we both were out of town and she swore he'd have a pet sitter. I came home before her to find a note from the landlord about the dog's noise and my entire kitchen covered in dog feces and piss. She had tried to barracade him in the kitchen with empty laundry baskets and left him newspapers to pee on.  \n\n\nI also walked in on her doing cocaine with a guy we both knew off of the top of our microwave. The wild part is they unplugged the microwave and were sitting on the living room floor using it as a coke mirror. Another time I walked in on her snorting meth with one of her coworkers. No. Just no.  \n\n\nI can say without question if I were ever to live with \"a friend\" again, I'd have a camera too. You are beyond NTA. People are really stupid and you have every right to know your stuff is safe.", "INFO: why doesn't this place have locks?", "Thanks! I have left it on, they have covered it tho.", "Most recent update: her guests have arrived. The pregnant lady decided she wanted to take a look at the camera. Took it off its stand on the shelf, and then struggled to put it back.", "Thanks, yeah. I guess not my best decision, but when I decided to add security, I was a couple weeks away from leaving and swamped with work. The lease does say I have to ask permission before changing stuff like that. For me, at that time, buying a camera felt simpler.", "Thanks for your perspective! It does make me suspicious that for them, I am the bad guy and made them feel uneasy for setting a camera in my own private space that I pay for. I did tell them that the camera was there to give me peace of mind about my stuff. \n\nI'm also weirder out that it took them so little after I was gone to go into my room. And it makes me wonder wonder what they have done before when I'm not there.\n\nI'm pretty sure she started planning all of that the moment she realised I was going overseas. This is something I tend to do always this time of the year, but it was official 2 months ago. We had a conversation about family and holidays, and I gave her the idea that her family could come over since we had a spare room. I said that, thinking it would only be her mother and brother, and at no point did I offer my room.", "I will be doing that", "She has now informed me that her mum and herself are staying in the guest room. I have no clue who is staying in her room, but this just shows that she had stuff already planned, and using my room was part of it.", "You are right, I am planning on turning it off at night. But I did want to see C comply with the other conditions I set (change bedding, clean). I also wanted to make sure she is not putting more people in there. She has obviously lied, so I wouldn't be surprised if she did something different to what she told me.", "Thanks for that! I will look into it", "I'm planning on looking at my options once I am back. The lease goes for 6 months more. And the civil way to get out is to have them agree on me leaving, which I will doubt they will. I can pass a legal request for it, so we'll see.", "Guests were informed.", "I will, thanks! Honestly, it felt so odd looking at the video. M even measured with his hand how open the sliding door of the bathroom was, looked inside, and closed it, making sure it was left the same.\nThis makes me worried and fairly certain that they have done this before.", "I will eventually. While this makes me mad, I don't want it to ruin my mood while travelling!", "Lol what a great comment, thanks!", "Looking at my options", "Tbf, I told them I was using the guest room exclusively for 3 weeks, as I had guests myself (this was at the beginning of our lease, and several months have passed since my guests left). There was also a conflict about a built-in desk found on the second floor. As I work from home, I told them I was using it. \n\nThat caused an argument, and M said that it made him uncomfortable that I work there as the desk is next to his room, but he had no issue on C taking it as her study desk. This is stupid because by the time we moved in, we already knew C deferred her semester. So they were mad I wanted the desk, and said that they'll use the guest room when there are no guests, and if there are, I have to move my stuff, so they move their stuff to the desk.\n\nIn retrospect, all of this is stupid. I wanted to compromise because, as I've commented before, I considered C a good friend. Our friendship has been deteriorating since we started living together, and slowly but surely, I have realised she is not a great roommate.", "Camera talks! But yeah, I'll look into lock options, as well as move out options.", "That is a good point, I guess it gives me evidence.", "dude you\u2019re paying FOUR HUNDRED more for your room and they\u2019re treating it like a public space? this isn\u2019t friend behavior especially since you say there is a spare bedroom they\u2019re just using for storage. They\u2019re walking over you and your boundaries AND you\u2019re paying more for it!", "It picks up some of the hallway outside my door if the door is open.", "I wish he would be understanding. So far, I've had so much trouble with the landlord. But I'll see what I can do when I'm back. Thanks :)", "I like that idea, thanks!", "Yeah, I think these comments are making me realise this. As of right now, she has completely ignored my texts, and her guests have already arrived :/", "That is creepy about your dad and brother! Sorry that it happened to you.\nI definitely will. The funny thing is that they have set boundaries themselves, but they do the opposite when it comes to my stuff. Staying at this house was not my ideal situation, but it benefited me in a way. I was already planning on moving out when the lease changed to a month-to-month basis in 6 months, but I will see what options I have to break it earlier.", "Update to you: they did in fact cover the camera with a towel.", "Are you able to contact your other roommate? Maybe they can help.", "Thanks, that's good advice. I'm pretty sure it states I have to ask the landlord for permission before changing it.", "I would definitely confront your roommates when you return just to let them know they were in your room previous to them discovering the camera and you saw them going through your stuff. What was he looking for anyway and she put everything back like it was. I would be FURIOUS for this breach of privacy.

They can either respect your space or stay elsewhere", "No", "NTA, but why can't you change the doorknob to one with a lock and put the old one back before you move? Also, if you want to be petty buy a cheap contact alarm. They're usually like 10 bucks and attach with double sided tape. Everytime they open the door an alarm will sound to remind them they aren't supposed to be there.", "NTA. And talk with landlord about the lock.

The camera on while someone is sleeping IS creepy. You know that they will just block the camera, right?", "Omfg I am so sorry that happened to you. That's insane that she got a dog without anyone's permission and then abandoned it while travelling! People are indeed stupid!", "From what I have seen, it is standard in the area. I'm not originally from here, so I wouldn't know.", "Can you get a new door knob? With a lock in it?", "Definitely NTA but you are on very shaky ground here. If you ended up with footage of the relatives or worse still their children in a state of undress, you could be looking at a world of trouble. I absolutely wouldn't be offering to allow them in the room with the camera on, I think you're opening yourself up to a host of problems that could ultimately involve law enforcement or at least legal issues.\n\nYou're not comfortable having them in your room. That's the end of it. Don't move to some dodgy middle ground where you could end up accused of voyeurism. Just say no to them being in your room.", "It's just two screws to swap out a door knob, you can do it, piece of cake!

They're walking all over you right now.", "Theyve been snooping on you for a while. Some people get a kick out of doing that knowing you cant tell/guess. Its super creepy that your so called friend was helping this guy hide his trail by fixing things behind him. This person is NOT your friend. Especially if you told her how you felt violated when that person entered your room in the past. \n\nAlso, why do you even pay more rent if they get 1.5 rooms since the spare is just now an extension of their bedrooms?", "They are acting like you're the bad guy because they know THEY are doing things they should not be doing. Going through your things? Borrowing items and asking permission later? These would be more than enough for me to revoke ANY access to my private space.\n\nThey wouldn't have a problem with you having a camera if they weren't afraid of being caught doing something wrong.", "\n\nObviously they've already shown that you can't trust them because they've entered your room several times for questionable purposes", "I'm looking at options, but there is not much I can do right now while away", "Thanks, I'll be telling them to vacate as soon as she replies to me", "Yes!

Lol I was thinking heavy metal", "Thanks, will do!", "When I told her about the guy entering my room, her response was, \"I'm sorry that happened. You should have told me before.\" Then proceeded to make it a point that I should have communicated it before, and basically telling me that I'm an idiot for keeping that information from her.\n\nI honestly have to rethink the rent situation. I do get more space in the spare as well as the use of a built-in desk located on the second floor. But I've realised how much space they take, not only the spare room, but they also have a lot of shit taking one of the two car spaces in the garage. Which has also been lots of trouble, because I said I'd leave my car in the garage while I'm gone, and they asked me to leave my car keys in case they had to move it. Idk why they'd need to move it.", "Do you have family or friends that can take care of it for you?", "I hope you've let them know that you know that they're using your room without permission and have covered the camera.

If you want to let them use the room, turn your camera off, if you don't, then don't let them.\n\nYou absolutely lied about looking for a door lock, there are tons of rental friendly options available in pretty much every country on earth, so I feel like you definitely wanted the camera for whatever creeper purposes you have, and you were probably excited about the idea of them using your room, because then you'd have your creepy little spycam in there.\n\nObviously you're a sick creeper. And and asshole. YTA.", "My partner is in there. But he said this is something that has to be talked between C and I when I'm back, and he has no reason to intervene.

I also said that she is breaking the conditions for her guests to stay and that I hope she is able to realise it. She is completely ignoring my calls and texts. \n\nI will look for locks. But my priority will be to move our. I guess I'll get the locks in the meantime.", "I do recognise that I should have simply said no. While this is no excuse, more of an explanation for my thought process, I valued C as a good friend, so I did not want to say no to not damage the friendship. I was very clear about not wanting anyone in my room since she asked, yet she was very persistent and continued asking, I only accepted under my conditions.\n\nAs for the locks, I first have to obtain permission from my landlord to change anything, and I had little time between deciding to add security and my trip; I'm also not savvy about this stuff, but I did look for alternatives like doorknob blockers, which unfortunately would not fit my doorknob. As well as childproof locks. The problem is that the electrician was scheduled to go when I was away. So even if I had the opportunity to get a proper lock or anything, I would have had to give C a way to get it, to let the electrician in. Which would defeat the purpose of having something to stop them from entering. \n\nGiven all of that, having a camera to look over my stuff sounded like the best option. And when I put it up, no one had any reason to go into my room, nor was I asked if anyone could stay.", "Have we found one of the room mates here?", "Ah i disagree with your partner, completely. She should know not to goin your room. Theyre taking advantage of you and being disrespectful of your stuff and space. I hope you can find a new place when you get back!

I also wouldn't like the idea of strangers staying in my room and i see in other comments you are going to tell your roommate you don't want this.

I would personally be wildly uncomfortable with that, and if not for the prior experiences that drove you to get a camera in the first place I might even agree that you should turn it off. But the thing is that there are some very good reasons you have that camera, reasons your roommates are well aware of because it\u2019s their own fault.

She is not a good friend. You should not feel uncomfortable saying no to a friend. She should respect your no.", "Definitely discuss options with your land lord. They may let you out of the lease early, or talk to your roommates. \n\nIf you offer to find someone to take over your lease, that can also help move things along. If your land lord is reluctant.", "I have tried calling. No response. My bf is in the same city but not in the house (I sometimes get my English wrong, it's not my first language).\nPlus over there is already night, different time zones. So I would expect him to go to my house for this at this time.", "Same! My rental had the doors replaced before I bought it but it still has the mortise strikes/holes on the door jamb.", "Baby shark", ">She also said it shows that I have no trust in her or M and assured me that they have NEVER entered my room without my permission\n\nSince you have documentary evidence of them, erm, LYING.

If C is breaking into your room, there's a good chance they are breaking into the other friends room as well, it might at least be worth warning them. I dunno.", "I\u2019ve had to shop for door knobs recently and they\u2019re not terribly expensive. If you get any pushback, maybe offer to let the landlord keep whatever lockable knob you buy so future renters won\u2019t have to worry about it. I imagine most people would want a lock anyways & it might sweeten the deal for them."]}
