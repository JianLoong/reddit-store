It\u2019s a 4 bedroom house. The master, on the first floor, is mine. Upstairs the other three, one is C\u2019s, the other is M's (28M), and the fourth is meant to be a guest bedroom - but it is currently used as storage by C n M. I\u2019m currently overseas, but I\u2019m still paying my share of the rent, which is $400 more per month than what they pay.\n\nNone of the bedroom doors have locks. This has caused incidents, like when C was hosting a party the night before I had an early start for work, and her drunk friend entered my room at 3AM, and stood at the foot of my bed for about 30 seconds. This scared me and made me feel like I had no privacy in my own space, and I was not able to sleep.\n\nBased on that and knowing that C was hosting holiday get-togethers, I wanted to ensure my stuff and my bedroom were untouched while overseas. I initially wanted to get a lock for the door, but there were no rental-friendly options. So instead, I bought a security camera and set it up on a shelf in my room.\n\nNot even a couple hours after I left for the airport, my camera picked up activity. Both roommates came in, M seemed to be looking for something while disorganizing my stuff; C was behind him fixing what he touched. The day after, C entered my room, went to the bathroom, and took my hair dryer. Messaged me later asking if she could borrow it.\n\nThey did not notice the camera until days later when C had to let an electrician into my bedroom and saw it. C asked me about it, and \"jokingly,\" said I lacked trust. I told her I had turned it on that day. Days later, C\u2019s mum entered to my room, looked around, and left.\n\nI was aware that C\u2019s family was coming over, today she asked if her friends (two adults and their kid) could stay in my bedroom. Told me the lady has back problems and is pregnant, so she offered the master to not make her go upstairs.\n\nI made it clear that it makes me uncomfortable to have strangers sleep in my bedroom. However, they could stay under my conditions: My bedding cannot be used, everything has to be left as it was, and the camera is to be kept on.\n\nShe was fine with the first two but told me the camera was too extreme. I explained that the camera was there for my own peace of mind, as I have my WFH equipment and valuable things that I want to make sure remain untouched. \n\nShe said that the camera was creepy and felt uneasy since finding out about it. She also said it shows that I have no trust in her or M and assured me that they have NEVER entered my room without my permission. Eventually told me that she \u201callows me\" to keep the camera on, but she is still arguing with me through texts.\n\nI\u2019ve seen through the camera that she is getting my room ready.\n\nSo, AITA for setting up a camera in my bedroom and refusing to turn it off while my roommate's guests stay there?", "created_utc": 1672441652, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zzeg5h/aita_for_refusing_to_turn_off_the_camera_in_my/", "score": 286, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Wtf they shouldn\u2019t even be in ur room you\u2019re paying that extra 400 you should be able to put a lock on your door ASAP and I will get one of those cameras to talk so the next time we enter your room tell them to get the fuck out", "NTA. Considering they've already lied to you about being in your room, I'd say huge red flags and then to offer your room first and ask second is messed up.

If they really didn't go in your room or take your things, then there's no reason they should have a problem with you having a camera.

Frankly, having a camera on when someone else is sleeping in a bedroom is creepy.", "Hell I was a tweaker w my college apt roommates, and we all minded our business. Entering someone else\u2019s room without good reason and/or permission is fuckin creepy. \n\nLet\u2019s say a family member went into my room at the moment (1bed share w hubby), they would see a few ball stretchers on my nightstand, my mushroom honey, a sharps box for my meds and a bunch of other random crap. It\u2019s a private space and like, fuck no. I grew up having my dad and brother constantly barge in my room, so I would lock myself in the bathroom but guess what? THEY SOMETIMES CHILLED ON MY BED WHILE I WAS SHITTING (5ft from the door of my tiny bathroom). OP you definitely need to set some concrete boundaries with true consequences, get a lock and start an early search for a new living situation"]}
