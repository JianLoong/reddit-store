Because no therapist who even halfway knew how to do their job would suggest or validate something so likely to ruin a relationship and get her kicked out of the place she\u2019s living.\n\nNTA. Your sister is crossing a lot of very normal and justifiable boundaries. Kicking her out was the right move. If you didn\u2019t she would have kept overstepping and being extremely entitled and selfish.

I very much doubt a therapist said that.", "I seriously doubt her therapist told her to throw out your stuff. She probably told her to buy her own colorful utensils if she thinks that would make her happier.

Rain said her therapist did, but that would be a lie", "Sorry OP, I do not believe that a therapist would tell her to do that to somebody else\u2019s property. That makes zero sense at all. Most therapists won\u2019t even give you directions, they are there to hear you out, and to discuss things with you, guide you to your own conclusions - but they will not tell you what to do or not do.\n\nShe is telling you that that\u2019s what her therapist said, because she\u2019s deflecting, or trying to deflect the blame from herself to the therapist.", "I think her \"therapist\" is TikTok videos and TV sitcoms; because that line is a total cliche, not therapy.", "Her therapist should be pointing out if she had her own home she could do what she liked.

Nothing wrong with that.  Especially if Rain approached OP and said, \"Could we have a little color in the living room and kitchen?  I have XYZ items I'd like to put out.\"   Then they could talk about it.  That's having a say.  Unilaterally throwing things out and painting the ceiling is not having a say.  That's trying to impose your will on others.  \n\nAnd the bit about seeking forgiveness vs. asking permissoin --that comes up (for me at least) a lot in work scenarios and in being willing to take risks.
