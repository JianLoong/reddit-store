Just because her mental health is declining and she is getting depressed from the colour of your walls doesn't mean she could do that without you and your wife's permission. You family are also assholes for thinking your in the wrong!! If you sister was depressed from the colour, she could just go to her room.", "NTA\n\nNo wonder her GF got fed up with her and threw her out.\n\nI am surprised your wife put up with this. She has ruined 4 rooms in your house, thrown out our utensils and soft furnishings.\n\nYou are better off with her gone and just have a quiet Christmas.\n\nSounds like it is going to cost you a small fortune to put everything right.", "NTA.  It sucks to throw someone out right before Christmas.  It also sucks to throw them out right before Thanksgiving, or Labor Day, or Independence Day, or Arbor Day, or American Redneck Day.  There is never a good time to expect someone from your home, but it has to be done.  \n\nIn your case, you said to throw Rain out.  She was damaging your home and changing the common areas without seeking your input or approval.  \n\nAnd since you are the owners, naturally you get fast as the villains of the piece.  \n\nYou did the right thing for yourself and your home.  But sometimes, doing the right thing sucks.  \n\nI do think you should consider hailing Rain into court for the damages, mainly to teach her a lesson.  But that would be like squeezing blood from a stone.  \n\nPS.  I do think Rain would have done no wrong if she had asked nicely about changing up some of the decorations in the home -- maybe, say, adding a colorful pillow or two to a single chair in the living room -- provided she has been willing to accept no for an answer.", "NTA. Her Rain of terror is over!", "NTA - I would take her to court to get reimbursed for the damage. Take pictures of every damage she has caused. Yes that includes painting the walls. Your family is being ridiculous. Honestly I would go no contact with Rain and everyone else who is on her side.", "NTA your house your rules. You pay the bills she does not. You and your wife should not suffer, because she can\u2019t listen.", "NTA\n\nYour extended family may be giving you crap now, but give it time. Once your sister pulls the same crap with them, they will change their tune.", "NTA. Holy crap.  That is crazy behavior.  It is YOUR home.  Even if she paid rent, you aren't typically allowed to make changes like that to an apartment!  I think she is either lying to her therapist or you about what the therapist said.  It is fine if the grey depressed her, but if you were letting her have free reign of the room you let her stay in, then she had NO REASON to ruin things in your home.  If you want to make changes to a home, make it your own home.  NTA.", "NTA if she doesn't like your house she should move out and stay at other places .

Not in any manner.", "NTA.  How dare you not allow an ungrateful, spoiled and entitled guest to redecorate your house?  I can't even imagine the nerve of your sister to do this!  You're being generous in not demanding payment from her for the repainting of your house and replacement of items she threw away.  Mind boggling.", "NTA. \nI would sincerely lose my mind if a guest did that. \nFamily is family, but people need to learn to stay in their lane.", "NTA\nWhat is with families co-signing bad behavior?!?! No rational person moves into someone else's home and starts making major changes like that, especially after you already told her no. That wouldn't be acceptable if she lived there full time and split the mortgage! If the family wants to enable her, they can all kick rocks. Enjoy your peaceful Christmas!", "Time to sue her for damages to cover the cost of fixing everything.  You were 100% right to kick her out.", "NTA. She's ridiculous. Who acts like that? You were so reasonable and gracious and she repaid your kindness by throwing out your things and destroying your home. She needed to be kicked out. Odds are she lied to family about what actually transpired - and she's going to pull the same stunts in her new home and wear out her welcome there too.", "NTA\n\nCan you total up all the damage that your family member did and present the negative Nellies with the bill.\n\nOk u want a say, she did 10k with of damage, when should I expect payment from you", "I can't even.

And how dare she paint your walks without your knowledge or permission! What gall!", "OP, take your sister to court for the cost of cleaning the rug and repainting.

I think her therapist is just like a fake friend because I think the advice they gave her was bad.", "I sincerely doubt her therapist said that. She will have taken some anodyne therapy talk like 'yes, Rain, you should express yourself and do the things you enjoy' and turned it into 'I am entitled to destroy someone else's house for my own amusement'. \n\nNTA.

You're supposed to work him, find out what will improve your mental health, then how can you incorporate it into your life, in Realistic way. You need more color?
