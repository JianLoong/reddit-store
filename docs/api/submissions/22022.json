Why would anyone pay the exorbitant Disney resort prices and not attend the theme parks more than one day?", "NTA\n\nWhy would you be at Disney with a child and then tell the child he cannot go to the parks? \n\nIt makes no sense to be right there in a Disney property and not go, the child knows the parks are right there, that is the whole reason to go to Disney and not to another place!", "Hell no, that shit is expensive. I remember my mom took me and my older brother to Universal. My older brother spent every day in the hotel room because he just wanted to. Wasted like $1,500 of my moms money. Hours of her life. I was so pissed at him.", "NTA.\n\nBut just for clarification, your family paid to go to Disney, and chose to just spend the entire holiday in the hotel? Seems like a massive waste of money, they could have just stayed at home and done the exact same thing", "NTA, I\u2019m not sure why you would go to Disney and not go to the parks for at least a good portion of the time. Honestly, this is often the downside of large family vacations. Expectations should have been set early about how much time together was expected. Having a small child means you\u2019ll have different needs throughout the day compared to teenagers.", "NTA\n\nSo long as you are socializing with family on a daily basis it makes no sense for someone with the target audience to not go to disney world.", "NTA. It's unfair for your small child to be cooped up in a hotel for an entire holiday. This is a special time so you should make the most of it", "NTA. I cannot imagine paying the prices that one pays to stay on property at Disney if you're not going to the parks. TBH, those hotels are as mid as they come for what they're charging. The beds are uncomfortable, the quick serve food sucks, etc. The only redeeming quality of many of them is the pool deck or speciality restaurants. Why would a group of adults and teenagers willingly choose to spend a vacation at a kiddie hotel if they're not going to hit up the actual main attractions?", "Why would you go and not leave the hotel lol", "Probably NTA, you shouldn\u2019t base your travel schedule on others because they wanna stay in, and it\u2019s not as if they are going outside.\n\nyou have free will too", "NTA \n\nwho in their right mind would go to Disney to spend their entire time in a hotel? Especially teens\u2026 there\u2019s so much to do in the parks for them.", "The hotels on the property are really cool with a lot to do but who the heck goes to Disney and doesn\u2019t hit the parks?? NTA", "Info: did you talk about expectations on how to spend time (together) before the trip?", "Hmmmm. But I wonder if something is missing from this. Like, what were the conversations like ahead of time? What were other people's expectations? Did you share yours? What were the hopes and plans about time spent together in the parks?\n\nAre you, as the parent of the only small child, making it your business to invite them to the park with you and your kid, and tell people your plans/when to meet in the morning to go? Or are you just hopping on the shuttle and texting, see ya at dinner!\n\nCould be you all wanted different things and you're all getting what you wanted. But it also has the vibes that no one in your family is great at planning or communicating. \n\nWhy would they all choose Disney and then not go with the families only little kid. It seems like on the face of it they chose this destination specifically for your immediate family. So why the disconnect.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Who goes to Disney and doesn\u2019t go to the theme parks?", "Would be helpful to know relative ages and relationships of the people in the group. \n\nBut NTA, you're making the most of the trip, sitting around a pool all day sounds boring when there's stuff to see and do in the vicinity and a kid to amuse.", "NTA.  There are hundreds of options if you want to enjoy a nice hotel or resort and just relax.  I can't imagine paying Disney prices only to sit around and not experience the best part, the parks.  Especially with kids.  Our family went back around 2005-2006 and a tropical storm came through, but a couple of us still hit Epcot for some of the indoor rides.", "NTA. You don't have to be with your relatives all the time, you have your own nuclear family and your kid to get vacation fun for. It would be cruel to be near Disney and stay in the hotel.", "Definitely NTA.  What do they think you're going to do to entertain a kid all day by just staying in?", "NTA.  The family dynamic is different with a small child vs. teenagers.  Of course your wanted to go to the theme parks!  You have a child.  The amenities at a resort (other than perhaps the pool) are not nearly as attractive to a kid as Mickey Mouse!", "My thoughts exactly!", "Completely agree.\nDisney is a huge expense.  We hit parks every day of our trip except one rest day at the pool. Good on you making great memories with your kid.\n\nAlso, in my experience big family vacations work best when daytimes are free for everyone to do their own thing and everyone gathers together in the evenings.", "My mum in her 70s did want to go to Disneyland i told her i booked a 5star hotel with a spa and wine bar she was like ok she will go guess who never saw the inside of the spa and  wine bar and loved the parks", "No  it wasn\u2019t  chosen for my immediate family. Actually it was already decided. It was just going to be a family reunion. Guess because it\u2019s a family oriented environment. Yes- We are the one with kid. It was decided a while ago and yea we agreed to go and we knew they weren\u2019t going to parks and chill at the hotel (that was stated several times). That was very clear   But still I felt it wouldn\u2019t be odd to take my child there"]}
