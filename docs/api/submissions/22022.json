I remember my mom took me and my older brother to Universal. My older brother spent every day in the hotel room because he just wanted to. Wasted like $1,500 of my moms money. Hours of her life. I was so pissed at him.", "NTA.\n\nBut just for clarification, your family paid to go to Disney, and chose to just spend the entire holiday in the hotel? Seems like a massive waste of money, they could have just stayed at home and done the exact same thing", "NTA, I\u2019m not sure why you would go to Disney and not go to the parks for at least a good portion of the time. Honestly, this is often the downside of large family vacations. Expectations should have been set early about how much time together was expected. Having a small child means you\u2019ll have different needs throughout the day compared to teenagers.", "NTA\n\nSo long as you are socializing with family on a daily basis it makes no sense for someone with the target audience to not go to disney world.", "NTA. It's unfair for your small child to be cooped up in a hotel for an entire holiday. This is a special time so you should make the most of it", "NTA. I cannot imagine paying the prices that one pays to stay on property at Disney if you're not going to the parks. TBH, those hotels are as mid as they come for what they're charging. The beds are uncomfortable, the quick serve food sucks, etc. The only redeeming quality of many of them is the pool deck or speciality restaurants. Why would a group of adults and teenagers willingly choose to spend a vacation at a kiddie hotel if they're not going to hit up the actual main attractions?", "Why would you go and not leave the hotel lol", "Probably NTA, you shouldn\u2019t base your travel schedule on others because they wanna stay in, and it\u2019s not as if they are going outside.\n\nyou have free will too", "NTA \n\nwho in their right mind would go to Disney to spend their entire time in a hotel? Especially teens\u2026 there\u2019s so much to do in the parks for them.", "The hotels on the property are really cool with a lot to do but who the heck goes to Disney and doesn\u2019t hit the parks?? NTA", "Info: did you talk about expectations on how to spend time (together) before the trip?", "Hmmmm. But I wonder if something is missing from this. Like, what were the conversations like ahead of time? What were other people's expectations? Did you share yours? What were the hopes and plans about time spent together in the parks?\n\nAre you, as the parent of the only small child, making it your business to invite them to the park with you and your kid, and tell people your plans/when to meet in the morning to go? Or are you just hopping on the shuttle and texting, see ya at dinner!\n\nCould be you all wanted different things and you're all getting what you wanted. But it also has the vibes that no one in your family is great at planning or communicating. \n\nWhy would they all choose Disney and then not go with the families only little kid. It seems like on the face of it they chose this destination specifically for your immediate family. So why the disconnect.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Who goes to Disney and doesn\u2019t go to the theme parks?", "Would be helpful to know relative ages and relationships of the people in the group. \n\nBut NTA, you're making the most of the trip, sitting around a pool all day sounds boring when there's stuff to see and do in the vicinity and a kid to amuse.", "NTA.  There are hundreds of options if you want to enjoy a nice hotel or resort and just relax.  I can't imagine paying Disney prices only to sit around and not experience the best part, the parks.  Especially with kids.  Our family went back around 2005-2006 and a tropical storm came through, but a couple of us still hit Epcot for some of the indoor rides.", "NTA. You don't have to be with your relatives all the time, you have your own nuclear family and your kid to get vacation fun for. It would be cruel to be near Disney and stay in the hotel.", "Definitely NTA.  What do they think you're going to do to entertain a kid all day by just staying in?", "NTA.  The family dynamic is different with a small child vs. teenagers.  Of course your wanted to go to the theme parks!  You have a child.  The amenities at a resort (other than perhaps the pool) are not nearly as attractive to a kid as Mickey Mouse!", "My thoughts exactly!", "Completely agree.\nDisney is a huge expense.  We hit parks every day of our trip except one rest day at the pool. Good on you making great memories with your kid.\n\nAlso, in my experience big family vacations work best when daytimes are free for everyone to do their own thing and everyone gathers together in the evenings.", "My mum in her 70s did want to go to Disneyland i told her i booked a 5star hotel with a spa and wine bar she was like ok she will go guess who never saw the inside of the spa and  wine bar and loved the parks", "No  it wasn\u2019t  chosen for my immediate family. Actually it was already decided. It was just going to be a family reunion. Guess because it\u2019s a family oriented environment. Yes- We are the one with kid. It was decided a while ago and yea we agreed to go and we knew they weren\u2019t going to parks and chill at the hotel (that was stated several times). That was very clear   But still I felt it wouldn\u2019t be odd to take my child there", "Nope....We recently spent a week in Jamaica....I can't tell you how many people just \"stay in the resort\".... that's not seeing the island at all. Especially considering resorts are tailored to the guest wants/ needs.\n\nThey had multiple dining options but I didn't go to Jamaica for Italian food or tex-mex (we're from Texas).... And the buffets have local foods made poorly as a representation of the actual cuisine as its catered to the tourists likes. \n\nWe rented a car and saw 1/2 of the island; didn't spend a single day at the resort for more then a few daylight hours at best. Even the local drivers (we paid for an all day excursion driver since we were a little tired by day 4) and hotel staff were impressed that We chose to SEE the island each day. \n\nWe learned the history; saw the local excursions (not \"swim- with- dolphins\" type excursions that you can do literally anywhere you go). We went shopping in Ocho Rios; Toured the Rose Hall and Fort Charles. Visited the bioluminescent harbor, YS falls, and Black River. And ate at ALOT of local eateries like Scotchies, Gloria's,  and the Pelican Bar. We SAW Jamaica not just vacationed on the resort. \n\nNTA", "Vacations are different for everyone. I personally just do the 1 day and rest by the pool in the warm sunshine. It\u2019s heaven. \n\nI don\u2019t get to dictate what others do, if you want to go to the park from dawn til dusk, I\u2019d feel nothing but joy mixed with relief. No small kids to entertain. \n\nStrange hill to die on for your family. \n\nNta", "NTA. You don't have to stay at the resort all day just because your family doesn't want to go in to the parks.\n\nFor everyone else asking how people can stay in the resort all day,  some of these resorts are experiences in and of themselves. The Animal Kingdom lodge has tons of live animals with viewing platforms and educational programs, the Polynesian has boat rentals, fishing, and character dining experiences, the Grand Floridian has spas and a restaurant that is on the Michelin rating system (idk if it's actually got stars or just recommended), and every resort has got loads of pools with related activity programming. Plus Disney Springs is a huge shopping center with concerts and other activities that is free to go to,  and buses go from the resort to Disney Springs all day every day. \n\nWhile I personally wouldn't go to Disney without seeing the parks, I can understand how someone else would find it more relaxing to stay at the resort and still have plenty of things to do. The parks are stressful even on a good day, and standing in line for hours is not anyone's idea of relaxation.", "NTA If they want to stay at the hotel the whole time that's fine you want to go to the parks. I assume they are using the hotel amenities like spas and stuff which is fine. It's unrealistic to expect a large group of of the people to be together at all times on a vacation. You aren't forcing them to go to the parks so they have nothing to be upset about.\n\nWhy would they book a hotel at Disney if they don't want to go to the parks? Disney world does have some Amazon hotel resorts but why not book somewhere else if they aren't interested in the main attraction?", "People are weird. My 4 friends went to Japan for Nye in college. 1 girl never left the hotel room & ate nothing but McDonald's.", "I\u2019m picturing myself telling my teenagers, \u201cOh, we are just going to relax here all day.  One day at the parks is more than enough!\u201d", "Vacations are different for everyone. I personally just do the 1 day and rest by the pool in the warm sunshine.", "[removed]", "My dad insisted on two simple rules - we ate breakfast and dinner as a family, especially the character breakfast for the grandson.\n\nMind you he paid hotel, airfair, shuttles, and admission to disney parks.  even for girlfriends.", "Heck no, NTA!\n\nIf they wanted to chill around the pool all day, there are definitely cheaper hotels they could have gone to.\n\nBesides, I love Disney parks, and getting to get in early is a great perk of staying on the property.", "NTA.  My boyfriend works at Disney World and we go occasionally together with his employee discount.  Even when we are paying half price for hotels and various other things and getting into parks for free, we make sure to make the most of it.  \n\nIf our family joins, they tend to enjoy hanging out and drinking around pools and relaxing more than going to the parks.  They can do whatever they want, we just meet up for dinner usually.  Granted, we all live within 20 minutes of each other in Florida, so it's less of a massive vacation and more of a staycation for us, but it's always seemed reasonable to me that we enjoy our respective partners and small families during the day and join together as a large family for the evenings.", "Why would you spend all that money to go to Disney and just stay at the damn hotel the entire time? \ud83e\udee4", "NTA", "So my friends and I currently planning a disney trip and I'm deep in a youtube disney vacation hole.\n\nApparently the logic is disney is a huge expense and if you're staying on site- you're paying all this money for the amenities at your hotel so shouldn't you use them. Disney hotels have all sorts of things to do and people do things like come and just stay at the resorts.\n\nWhy spend $400/night if you aren't going to spend enough time at the hotel to make the $400 worth it? (obviously there are a lot price points and you don't need to spend $400 but you can also spend a lot more.)\n\nThat said, there is a huge difference between toddlers and teens, particularly at Disney. Even if everyone went to the park, they'd be interested in different things and it wouldn't make sense for everyone to spend the whole day together when the teens want to fast rides and you need to wait for the dumbo ride for time 25.", "Well the theme park tickets aren't included in the resort price. So maybe the other people didn't have enough money to go to all the parks? Just guessing obviously... But the last time I was there it was like $130 a person for tickets, so if you had a family of four you're looking it over $500 just to walk in the door...every day! Maybe the others couldn't afford it?", "Depends on which resort they\u2019re at how exorbitant it was. When I booked my trip (for this year) they had resort options for $125/night. I don\u2019t know how that compares to not-Disney options in Orlando, but imo $125/night isn\u2019t bad for a vacation. Between Disney Springs and all the resorts, you can access all sorts of stuff like pools, spa, movie nights, character dining, art classes, mini golf, etc without paying $130ish per person park tickets.\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely wild to have a vacation at Disney and get upset when people DO want to go to the parks though. OP is def NTA.", "I remember my mom took me and my older brother to Universal.", "Why would they all choose Disney and then not go with the families only little kid.", "My sister did that when I spent a summer with her. I\u2019d get up and go to cook us breakfast but she\u2019s stop me and everyday all day it was some form of fast food. This was the summer after eighth grade. I refused to eat any fast food till I turned 21 and my boss ordered pizza for our work. Now I eat it sometimes but the majority of what I eat is chicken. During the w summer I snack on fruit bowls.", "Right, and if you have a family of four it's like over $500 to get in a park! If you're already paying that much to stay overnight I would definitely minimize the parks to save that money. Especially when they do have a lot of stuff to do at the resorts.", "That sounds like a very expensive way to do a family reunion.\n\nPersonally, even if I didn't have kids, you make the family reunion at Disney and I would absolutely hit the parks at least a few of the days. Wouldn't even care if I was the only one in the family doing it and completely solo in my park time. Done it solo a couple of times before, would do it solo again.\n\nFortunately for me, neither my extended family or my spouses family would do that. If we were at a place like that, it would be understood that the parks are on the agenda.\n\nYou're NTA in my book.\n\nOh, as I think about it, at least one of my solo Disney excursions did involve me skipping out on visiting family or family friends in the process. But I was also a teen, and my parents knew I'd be otherwise bored with who they were going to be visiting that day while we were in the area (SoCal). So they dropped me off at DL for the day.", "NTA. Each person has their own way to enjoy Disney. You do you!", "Years ago, I was pregnant, and my hubby & I invited his parents (and his 9 year old brother) to go to Disney World.  It was mid-May.\n\nIt was hot and humid, and I had terrible morning sickness.  The Monorail ride from our resort to the park made me sick.  But we went to the park every day with them. DH and I couldn't imagine going there and not spending the day with the only child in our group.  Seeing his face when we did rides or go to Epcot was the best part of the whole trip (30 years later he tells us it was the best vacation he ever went on!) \n\nOP, you are not the AH for going to the park daily with your kid.  A small child isn't going to be happy hanging around the hotel pool all day.  They want to go go go.  You did what you had to do to keep your child happy.  Sure it's a vacation, but not everyone thinks a vacation means just hanging out and doing nothing.  Your family is borderline jerkish for being upset that you are doing you, without waiting for them.  You don't owe them that.", "NTA.\n\nStaying one day to hang out at the pool is one thing.  Not mostly going to the parks, which is the whole point of Disney, is another story.\n\nI'm baffled why they didn't go to a regular resort in Florida or the Caribbean instead.", "NTA", "NTA at all irrespective of whether you're at Disney or anywhere.  A family with a small kid has different needs and priorities.  Do your thing without guilt.", "NTA, no way I'm going all the way to Orlando and not riding Haunted Mansion at least 3 times", "Thats cool with me as long as they don't expect everyone to be attached at the hip at all times and do only things they want to do when they want to do it.\n\nI'm big on the split up for a day depending on what people want to do.  I shared an airbnb with a couple and they asked if we didn\u2019t mind if they spend Thursday of a wed-fri trip by themselves because they had plans to do something specific.\n\nI was fine with that plus it worked out because Martha's vineyard in August is absolutely insane and the awesome thing my friend and I ended up doing wouldn't have been possible plus public transport was chaotic.\n\nIt can be insane trying to wrangle 4+ people the entire day and there's always that one person who's either indecisive and holds the group back or hates everything but what they want and holds the group back.", "It sounds like both OP, their partner and the kid are getting out what they want from the trip and so are the amenities focused people. \n\nIf that's not a good way to spend that money, I don't know what is.\n\nThis reminds me of when I look at kids screaming over ice cream cones at the beach.  The beach with rides and a boardwalk.  You're in a happy place, enjoy it!\n\nI said that to a kid crying in the Walmart checkout the other day.  'What's wrong?  You're in the happiest place on earth.'\n\nIt was kind of dark humor that time but he thought about it and stopped crying.", "The clinger types are just clingy.  Its not about reason.\n\nIt's a vacationer type.  I'm fascinated by vacation dynamics.   It really brings out some interesting dynamics.", "Sure you do. https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14xkzmu/comment/jrnjzn0/?utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3", "Sort of like going to a buffet restaurant and only eating from the salad bar....", "Some people vacation revolves around eating somewhere else far away.  Eat. Eat, eat.  Food , food, food, digest food, nap, more food, giant lines.  Tired. Sleep.\n\nAt least fast food is fast. These people like to *enjoy* meals.  Enjoy=take forever. \n\nI'd rather jetski.  Thanks.", "For sure. I get all that. But why even go to Japan to sit in a hotel & eat the same fast food you can get in Colorado? That's literally all she did. None of the other girls forced her. They tried to include her. Said, well if you feel like coming out, we'll be over here... See ya...i guess.", "Right? Or make your own food and take it with you."]}
