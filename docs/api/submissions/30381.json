My aunt and her husband are both very religious people and heavily control what their daughter \"Sara\" (12F) wears. I go really well with Sara since she was little. Sara expressed to me she feels very weird around her peers because of the way she dresses. Her mom buys all her clothes so she basically doesn't have any options. \n\nSo this time Sara came to visit us and she has hit a growth spurt and now we're basically the same size(I'm very petite, she's pretty tall for her age). So yesterday we were all going out for a picnic. I let Sara wear one of my dresses. A really cute pastel colored dress I made a year ago. I got her matching accessories too and she was very happy. We both dressed up and went downstairs to join the family. But he'll broke loose. My aunt started screaming at both Sara and me for our \"obscene\" clothing choice. She told me I had no right to dress her daughter the way I wanted and that I was trying to drag her away from religion too by indoctrinating her. That she decides how her daughter is raised and not me. Sara started to cry and went upstairs, refused to go anymore. My aunt kept knocking on the door and forced her to open it. Then she took her redressed her then forced her to the picnic. The girl was sobbing the whole time. \n\nI previously planned on giving Sara some of my clothes but now I don't know. I mean aunt is right that I'm just her cousin. But I don't think I'm \"indoctrinating\" her daughter by letting her wear what she wants. AITA?\n\n**Edit: Sara actually recently started wearing a hijab. I didn't mention initially because I thought it'd bring up unnecessary debate on that topic . So yeah, I also let her not wear a hijab. She really doesn't care about hijab but her parents do.

I doubt seriously the dress was inappropriate for a family outing, but again, you saw it as a dress and a nice gesture, your aunt saw it as a \u201cworldly dress \u201c FFS", "NTA i guess you didn't expect sush a reaction from her mother.  \nHonestly I pity the girl, her mother is an asshole here and I wouldn't have appreciated the insult.  \nNot being able to choose your clothes at this age is unimaginable to me. This child is going to experience a lot of sadness and depression, I can't even imagine what will happen if she ever wants a boyfriend...", "NTA in my opinion but I know others will disagree. The only misstep I think you made was letting her parents see her in clothes they wouldn't approve of, as it may be putting her in an unsafe situation. I've known extremely strict parents to beat their children for not complying with their rules. Religion or not, I don't think it's right to control what your child wears once they are old enough to decide for themselves what they do/don't want to wear. If they want her to stay in the religion then it needs to be her choice, any strong-arming will result in pushing her away and she'll rebel. She'll soon be a teenager, it's what they do. Her parents are TA for allowing something as individual and personal as religion to lead them to control and mistreat their daughter.", "NTA. You tried to make her feel special. It's a fight you won't win though. Especially since she's 12. That poor child will most likely get her freedom when she leaves home.", "NTA but you have to respect your aunt's wishes here.  I said not the asshole because your cousin asked for the clothes.  Shame she is being repressed right now but unfortunately you can't meddle.  I hope your cousin gets out soon if they are making her feel like that.", "NTA but sometimes you have to read the room a bit. The hijab will always be a bit contentious for some families. My Aunty cried and cried when her daughter chose to  start wearing one. Often it\u2019s the other way around. Think about gifting some of your clothes anyway, but wait a while, she will probably grow out of them anyway. Many women who wear hijab absolutely adore dressing up underneath their abaya. I\u2019m talking gorgeous dresses, sexy lingerie, the works. Many also like that they can throw the robe over their pyjamas and go to the shops. These are for your cousin to work out in her own time.", "NTA be there for her when she leaves. Cause she definitely will.", "NTA. Your intentions were to care for Sara and to help her feel comfortable and confident, especially at an age where peer acceptance can be very important. The fact that Sara was happy with the dress you provided shows that you were attentive to her feelings and desires.\n\n  \nHowever, it's clear that this crossed a boundary with her parents, particularly given their religious beliefs and practices. It's a delicate situation because while you want to support Sara, it's also important to navigate the family dynamics and respect the parents' wishes, even if you don't agree with them.\n\n  \nThe tears and the distress Sara showed indicate that she is in a tough spot, caught between her own desires and her parents' expectations. It's a sad situation, and it's understandable that you would want to help her.\n\n  \nI hope that Sara can find a way to express herself that doesn't cause conflict in her family. It's also important for her to have support from understanding family members like you, who can offer her a safe space to be herself. Hopefully, as she grows older, she'll be able to navigate her own path and make choices that are right for her, potentially with your support and the support of others who care for her well-being.", "YWBTA if you intended to override Sara's parents wishes, but it sounds like you were just trying to be nice - very appropriate and sweet. Didn't work so well, did it?\n\nThis is a situation that kinda sucks for everyone - the parents want what they want, Sara wants what she wants, everyone has a right to their opinion (and yes, even parental actions), so nobody is going to win. There's going to be struggles here until Sara is off on her own, and maybe even after.\n\nFor you, being sympathetic to Sara's desires and supporting her emotionally is probably a good thing, but that's not necessarily the same as disrespecting her parents' wishes. If she seems to like you through a 10 year age difference, cool. But her parents' wishes, whether anyone feels they're right or wrong, aren't endangering her, and they have a right to bring her up the way they see fit. Only give the clothes when and if the parents approve. Not likely, right? But there it is.", "NTA for lending her the dress. Your aunt is ridiculous and going to drive her away. But, Sara is a child, so don't \"gift her\" any clothes. \n\n\nBut the \"I let her not wear a hijab\" comment? How do you \"let her\"? You're the adult, she's a kid. You knew her parents wanted her to....so did you actively tell her \"It's okay, you don't have to wear one if you don't want to?\" I agree with you that she shouldn't have to, but it's absolutely not your place to tell her to walk out without one. The correct course of action is \"I choose not to wear one. When you are older, you should make that choice for yourself. Right now, you need to wear one around your parents.\"", "NTA because you were trying to help. Unfortunately you have no say and they control their daughter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>But I don't think I'm \"indoctrinating\" her daughter\n\nYou're not. They are.", "NTA. Thank you for giving her that moment of freedom, but you had no idea her family would react like that. I\u2019m sorry your cousin is going through this, but the other comments are right- it\u2019s essentially up to the parents and the only thing you can do is insincerely apologize and stay in touch with your cousin in case things get really tough for her so you can help then.", "NTA, her parents sound terrible", "NTA, but she's only 12. Stay in contact and as the years go by she knows she has someone to turn to.", "> She told me I had no right to dress her daughter the way I wanted\n\nOf course, that's not what you were doing; you were letting Sara dress herself how *she* wanted.\n\nUnfortunately, of course, Sara is still a minor and her mom will be calling the shots for quite some time yet.\n\nI'm sure it will come as a complete shock to her mom when Sara hits 18 and completely rejects what her mom has been trying to force on her...\n\nNTA.", "I see some of the most stylish hijabis out in the world. These young ladies are killing it for style.  Your cousin can have style and still be modest, so you may be TA here.  You can\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.  Support your cousin and respect your auntie.", "YTA, but I do sympathize with you and Sara both.\n\nShe\u2019s not your child and she\u2019s not being endangered by her parents\u2019 religion. She should have put on the hijab over her pretty dress, as her parents expected.\n\nEdited to correct: Sara should have worn the expected hijab WITH her pretty dress. Her parents might have still blown a gasket over it but that may have been the key thing that would have been the compromise to save the day.", "YTA for not thinking about your plan. \nYou put this kid in jeopardy instead of thinking this through. \nShe was yelled at, humiliated and forced to do something she didn\u2019t want to do. You gave her a taste of freedom without actually thinking about what it would cost her. \nYou\u2019re too old to not think your actions through. \n\nYour aunt and uncle are wrong but at this moment they have full control of her. Think, don\u2019t just act next time.", "YTA a 12 yo is a minor and you are not her parent. You may not agree with her parents religion but you need to accept that it is important to them and that is how they are choosing to raise her. You created an unnecessary conflict. She can make her own choices when she is older.", "YTA. You may not agree with the way your cousin is being raised but she is not your child. All you're doing is making life harder on your cousin. Stay out of it.", "Overall, NTA - right up until:\n\n>I also let her not wear a hijab.\n\nI'm hoping that's just a phrasing issue, but you seem to be implying that you personally have any authority or right to tell your cousin what she can wear or not wear on her own head.\n\nPersonally, if Allah wants someone to wear something, he/she/it needs to tell them himself/herself/itself directly, rather than depend on a several-thousand-year-old game of \"Telephone\" being played by people with direct interests in controlling the outcome.", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

However, Sara is only 12, and still has to follow her parents' rules. I\"m not Muslim, but good friends of mine are, and I understand the importance of head and body coverings, as I'm sure you do. At some point, Sara is going to want to break free from her parents' rules, and having you in her corner as and advocate is going to be super important. So for right now, toe the line. Maybe let her try on some of your things in the the privacy of your room so she can explore, but don't let her go out in public like that just yet.", "I don\u2019t know", "NTA but your best play is to stay close to your sister and have your door open to her when she can leave her asshole parents.", "On the bright side...the girl will have something to look forward to when she's 18, an adult, and can leave the house (assuming of course she's not the victim of a honor killing or FGM first).", "I really didn't expect her mom's reaction to be like that. I thought she'd object and then be like \"alr,don't do this again\". My mom used to be that way when I was younger but actually a little more lax. She'd not freak out if I wore a fun outfit at 12. And now my mom is completely fine with me having different values and beliefs.  But my aunt seems like something else completely. She suddenly became extremely religious since she started joining some religious discussions. Idk wtf is going on.", "OP has to respect the aunt's wishes FOR NOW.

Let Sara know she's not alone, OP.", "Yeah I told her she doesn't need to wear one if she doesn't want. Thing is I DIDN'T expect her mom to act like that at all. Her mom wasn't always *this* religious. It's a very recent thing and they have started to enforce strict rules on her since she started having periods a few months ago. It's just very bizarre to me.", "She doesn't want to cover her hair. She's 12,she wants to try out different hairstyles and figure out her personal taste. You can be modest without a hijab, they're not exclusive. How do you respect someone when they suddenly start to psychologically abuse their 12 year old daughter? I'll support her in whatever she chooses.", "A hijab wouldn't have covered the dress as it is only head covering.", "I meant I let her do what she wanted and that I don't have any right to control her clothing. She said she didn't want to wear a hijab and wear a specific dress. I told her that was totally fine by me.", "Unfortunately there's nothing you can do, which must be frustrating, I'm sorry.  \nOnly proven abuse could get her out of this house and I wouldn't wish that on her, a controlling parent is not so far off but not enough at the same time.", "If her mom has made her wear a hijab every day for months, you need to be deliberately obtuse to tell her she doesn't need to wear one and expect her mom to be okay with that.", "And that\u2019s cool - but at 12, your cousin is going to have to go home to live with your auntie.  Don\u2019t set her up for more abuse.  Look up hijab stylings. Use different scarves and colours that set off her natural colours, if that will keep her mother content.  \n\nHair styles under hijab style too.\n\nIt honestly sounds like you are against it and aren\u2019t willing to respect your aunts wishes; my only concern is to not push your little cousin into a more toxic situation.  I have had a niece in a radically different situation that I \u201cmade nice\u201d with her mother, just so that she had a lifeline out.  Which she eventually needed.  Isolation is no good for someone who is being abused, whether it\u2019s physical or psychological", "Excellent point. That you for pointing that out!", "Look, a lot of us wear hijab everyday to school, work , grocery shopping, getting a package from the porch etc but dress up when it's like a wedding or some other special occasion including family gatherings . Even her mom was like that. I wasn't aware of her drastic change.", "Her mom shops for her, she's not allowed to shop. I wasn't allowed to shop for my own clothes either . Not even having that choice/control makes it so much harder. I'm not against anyone choosing what they want to wear. My aunt's wishes would potentially cause so much harm to Sara's self image/worth. I'll just tell her to roll with it for now and assure her that I'll be there if she needs me . That's what I did, rolled with it and once I went off to university I did whatever tf I wanted then once my parents understood they lost their control over me they just accepted.", "Now you know & maybe you can support your cousin better as she deals with her family. Help your cousin be herself as much as she's able to around y'all & maybe your mom can help your aunt be a bit more flexible or understanding (this may not be possible) NTA as long as you don't do it again on purpose."]}
