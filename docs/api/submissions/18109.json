Before the pandemic, his diagnosis and everything he came out to me as gay, he said I was the only one he's ever told (I'm bi and out, he felt it was easier to come to me first) but that he was ready to start to slowly come out to our friends. I told him of course he has my support and offered my help and support if he wanted it to come out to our friends, he was grateful but said he'll do it himself when he's ready. That was about february 2020, in march everything shut down and we were confined, since he wanted to do it in person he decided to wait for a better time. As we all know it didn't get better soon, and by the time october came around and we were still in lockdown Daniel got diagnosed with cancer and started chemo, his illness became the priority since he got very sick very fast. Sadly in january 2021 he lost the battle and suddenly passed away, it was a very sudden death and an awful loss for all of us. \n\nNow, here's where I start my internal debate. It's been a few years and now that everything calmed down a bit we're (my friends and I) talking more freely about Daniel and reminiscing; me and Daniel were very close and practically joined at the hip, I loved him a lot but we never had any sort of attraction between us (I barely have any interest in men anyways). \n\nThe thing is, looking from the outside I can see how people could see us being romantically involved if they didn't know the context and that Daniel wasn't attracted to women at all since we were always together, going out, talking, etc. My friends and other people that knew us began making comments about us possibly being together, nothing too out of line but enough to make me uncomfortable since we didn't hav that kind of relationsip at all  (things like, your dates with Daniel, your romantic sleepovers, etc). I've tried to brush them off by saying we weren't like that, but they don't seem to believe it, even when I tell them I wasn't interested they still comment on how he still could've been interested in me; I feel like the only way to make them understand is to tell them he was gay and getting rid of the \"what if\", but I don't know if it's my place to out him like that, even to our close friends that have been nothing but supportive of me and I have no doubts they would've been of him too and that wouldn't change their perspective of him at all. \n\nIf he was still with us I know he would want to come out to them himself, but now that he's gone and I'm one of the few people he's trusted with this about him (he came out to his family and accidentally to one mutual friend before his diagnosis) I'm still not sure it's my right to pass that information along, even when it also affects me and my relationship to him. So, would I be the asshole if I told our friends he was gay?", "created_utc": 1684942267, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13qouvl/wibta_if_i_outed_my_dead_friend_to_our_close/", "score": 218, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He was incredible, and had an incredible life. He was also gay, and appears to have also done drag, but he was never able to come out fully.

I've been worrying about whether it is wrong for me to out him even now, especially considering some of my extended family's shitty beliefs. Your comment makes me feel better about it. I feel awful that he could never be true to himself in life. His sexuality goes a long way in explaining why his life turned out like it did, but it's only one facet of his story.", "Everything from \u201cLet them know the real Daniel\u201d to the very last sentence just put me in a MASSIVE chokehold! \ud83d\ude2d That was REALLY beautiful, man. \n\nDaniel deserves to have a little piece of Pride amongst the living.", "I agree with you absolutely, but my lingering concern is how this news will be interpreted and accepted when they\u2019re already seeing her as being in denial and defensive.
