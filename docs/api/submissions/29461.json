She wants time away from her kids, hire a babysitter.  If it's worth it to her, she'll do it.  Your aging parents aren't free labor for her.  She was and is being selfish.  She has no consideration for your parents difficulties, and wants free babysitting.", "Exactly! NTA, you\u2019re thinking about your parent\u2019s health and well-being, your sister is not. If she wants time without kids she needs to hire a babysitter, not rely on her elderly parents who are physically strained and harmed chasing the kids up and down stairs. You were kind enough not to actually call her selfish, but she is being selfish and her husband is enabling it. If the kids actually miss alone time with their grandparents your sister needs to work out somewhere they can have time together that doesn\u2019t harm her parents.", "No, sister is selfish because she's angry their parents won't stay over and babysit for her anymore. Her complaints are all about her and her needs.", "It all comes down to where their parents sleep when they visit.

But all she's doing is venting to her sister. To me that's not \"asshole\" behavior. But hey different opinions here\n\nI mean, she's repeatedly venting about the fact that bc her parents don't spend the night with them and help babysit the kids, she's not getting a break. Which is a pretty selfish thing to vent about. It would be one thing if she was upset that she's no longer able to spend as much time with her parents, but her focus seems to be on the fact they they no longer babysit. But there's an easy solution for the sister so she can get her break: hire a babysitter.", "It would be different if she vented to her sister about them not staying because now she gets less time with them.

My MIL actually fell down the stairs one time but she didn\u2019t tell anyone. No one knew until she came home and we saw her bruised arm and leg. She was reluctant to say anything but when pressed, she said she slipped down the stairs going from the room to the living room downstairs where she was watching the kids. She has stuff joints due to arthritis and it\u2019s worst in her knees. I was pretty upset about it because my coworker\u2019s mom recently passed due to falling down the stairs and breaking her hip and got some sort of infection. Do what is best for your mom. She probably can\u2019t even watch the kids anyway. Your sister is selfish.", "NTA. Your sister IS selfish. She can hire a babysitter instead of relying on her elderly parents.\n\nKudos to you for renovating the downstairs bathroom to include a shower for them. You're a good daughter.", "NTA. Why do people have kids and impose them on relatives?? If sis wants child free time she can hire a babysitter", "NTA.", "NTA.\n\nShe is selfish.\n\nYou weren't wrong.  Truth hurts.", "So, BIL and your sister just confirmed - her focus is her getting time away from the kids!\n\nYou are completely NTA.\n\nYou don't owe your sister indulging her selfishness, but you could (if her kids are reasonably well behaved at your house) offer to have her kids spend an afternoon at your house. Of course, if grandma and grandpa wanted more time with her kids, they could also offer to take them out for lunch or watch them play in the park. They may be relieved that sis can't pawn her kids off on them all the time. So I wouldn't offer their time in any way, but you could ask them if they would like to see her kids in such ways, now that they stay at your house. But again - you don't speak for them. The only thing you do is decide if/when sis's kids can come to your house.\n\nThat aside, too bad for sis that her free babysitters have a more navigable place to stay. She and BIL can always spring for babysitters or join with other moms in their neighborhood to take turns giving each other a break. Don't know how old the niblings are, but there is also their time in preschool/school (if not now, then in fairly soon). \n\nI also get the feeling that sis would be happy to drop your parents off at your house if their physical issues ever put them in a position of needing more help than being able to give her help. Something you may need to prepare to deal with in the future.", "NTA and she is selfish.", "NTA", "> she was just looking forward to some time without the kids\n\nBIL also acknowledges what she was looking for is free babysitting. NTA. OP you're doing good for your parents.

Your sister wants to put your parents and her kids at risk", "NTA if sister needs time to breathe she should hire a babysitter.", "NTA. Your sister is selfish since she's putting her want of free babysitting over the needs of your parents. The more your parents are made to walk up and down stairs the more likely it is that they will fall.", "NTA. Sounds like she's upset about losing the free babysitting.\n\nExpecting elderly people with joint problems to take the status frequently is awful, and very dangerous. A fall is bad, a fall *on stairs* is potentially fatal.", "NTA- Nooooope. There's literally nothing wrong with my 70s YO parents other than one expertly replaced knee that only needs to not do any circus tricks, and my sister and I still carefully pincer movemented them into moving out of the teeny village full of people even older than them in the middle of nowhere that becomes an island when it rains and 'spending the inheritance' on a swish one-level property in a beautiful town near all our relatives- especially the giant bulky blokes who can lift heavy things off them if they're stuck and the cousin who's a medical professional... Just in case. They are loving it there :) I've also given my father a hard deadline on wading into fast flowing water to fish on the basis 'Rubber clad pensioner pulled from river' is only funny if it happens to someone else. We do not let the loony boomers play fast and loose with their safety! They are a wildly irresponsible generation and us Saffy Monsoons have to be the responsible ones! If they had fallen down your sister's stairs trying to get up there ASAP cos the little one was crying one hopes she'd never have forgiven herself.", "Nta. She\u2019s upset you called her out on it.

Why does she need to make her parents babysit for 'time off'? I don't want to emplt anything but it reads like ops sister is a single parent with a roommate not a spouse who takes care of their children too", "This post reminds me of a friend's situation from years ago. Her daughter was in the hospital unexpectedly and it was going to be a 2 or 3 week stay. Daughter and hubby had a 4YO daughter. With hubby working and then spending time at the hospital, they needed help with the 4YO. So grandma (my friend) offered to come up and stay. She only worked a few hours a day and could do it virtually. Offer accepted. First problem was just like this post. She had a recent serious ankle injury so stairs were a problem but SIL wanted her to sleep in the basement bedroom. She refused because of the steep stairs she would need to use multiple times a day (not for the bathroom though). SIL also expected her to take the granddaughter out to the park every day. Again, ankle injury meant she couldn't walk long distances and certainly not every day. And those were just two of the issues SIL had. He basically wanted her, MIL, to do everything he wanted (which was more than his wife did!) and exactly how he wanted it. Forget that MIL was doing them a favor and that she did clean the house, do laundry, and make dinners every night. That was not good enough. The only good part about it is when the daughter found out how her husband was treating her mom, especially during this emergency time, she was pissed and told him off.", "If she weren't selfish she'd be happy her parents have a more suitable place to stay now.\n\nNo-one asked her to renovate. But she is now throwing a tantrum because her free babysitting is no longer available."]}
