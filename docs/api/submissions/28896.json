I have an older brother (35M) and a younger sister (29F). My brother and sister are not close, never have been, the only time they are in the same room is Christmas and maybe a family function. They do not keep up with each other's lives. When my brother got married he did not invite my sister and had he invited her, she would not have shown up. I get along with both siblings. I am a little closer to my sister. But I love my brother very much. And I never had any trouble with either of my siblings.\n\nI had fertility issues. I went through periods of not getting pregnant and then getting pregnant and miscarrying. While SIL was pregnant with my niece I suffered my most traumatic miscarriage. My parents and siblings showed up. My sister stayed when others had to leave, including my husband who had to go back to work the next day, but I had to remain in the hospital for a few days. She had no baby shower for her pregnancy. Initially I had planned to offer to host one for her but then the miscarriage happened and I couldn't. Apparently she was angry that my sister was so supportive of me and helped me out so much but never offered to throw a baby shower for her.\n\nI went for more extensive tests 18 months ago and we finally found out the reason for my fertility troubles. It was something they could help me with. They were surprised that I hadn't been diagnosed sooner. But I was lucky and I got pregnant and I had my son this past summer. Ever since I had my son SIL has been worse.\n\nShe's bitter that my sister threw a baby shower for me, alongside my two best friends. She's bitter that my sister met my son at the hospital and has been around him a lot. She feels like my parents were more excited about my son than my niece. She's angry that my brother was excited for me and also spent time with me and my son.\n\nMost of the time she glares at me and that's how I know she's mad. But a few times she has commented that I must love all the attention or it must be nice to know I can easily overshadow someone else's joy. Last week was when I had enough. It was my brother's birthday and my sister didn't show up. SIL was snapping at me constantly, saying how I hog my sister and how I rub her my sister's relationship with my son in her face and ranted about how everyone was so excited and there for me about my son and even comforting and supportive when I miscarried but nobody seemed to give a crap about her daughter and the fact my sister doesn't even want to try and have a relationship with our niece. She mentioned the baby shower too. Just so much stuff. I told her she was taking her anger about all of that out on the wrong person. I suggested she talk to my brother since he's the one with a bad relationship with our sister.\n\nSIL called me a bitch and my brother heard her at that point and came to calm her down and figure out what was wrong. She kept saying I was a bitch and he apologized to me. But she's real mad at me.

Where is the SIL\u2019s family? They could have thrown her a baby shower too. SIL in my opinion is being selfish over her own issues and not seeing the full picture. I think the self awareness is lacking and the ability to see that her husband and your sister aren\u2019t very close.", "INFO - why is your SIL so obsessed with your sister? Or is she just jealous of you? SIL has some issues she needs to work out and I don\u2019t think you can resolve them for her.", "Had a similar experience with my younger brother. He was always blaming me for any family trouble and never himself or anyone else. \nDon\u2019t be the scapegoat for your sis.

SIL is directing her anger at the wrong people. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just your brother. It sounds like the whole family dynamic has created a situation where she feels like her child is loved less. My kids have a set of grandparents who cannot listen to single achievement of theirs without bringing up something their cousin is doing- and sometimes mama bear in me wants to freak out at them for making their favorite so apparent. It\u2019s very possible your parents reaction to the birth of her child was less excited and somewhat muted by your struggles and then she saw them so elated over the birth of your son after everything you\u2019ve been through.

I understand that it would be difficult to foster a relationship with someone your husband didn\u2019t want to speak to, but it doesn\u2019t really sound as if she\u2019s tried. She\u2019s extremely jealous of you because you have good relationships with all of your siblings and they are very supportive of you. Where is her family in all of this? Does she have siblings, parents, aunts and uncle\u2019s? Does she have any friends? Why didn\u2019t someone from her family or friend group throw a baby shower?

I had a problem with my brother and his wife too. \n\nHe did not pass on information to his wife if he thought it would upset her. That made it look like I was leaving out details.

Party day, I hear SIL tell my brother she ordered extra pizza because John (my husband) eats so much. Hearing this turned on the lightbulb. I now knew that for years my brother was not telling her things she did not want to hear. I could now understand why she always seemed so distant to me. I commented that I told brother the final count. His answer: You didn't say that. Note: My original reply was not vague. He even asked why they would not be coming. \n\nThere is no way to go back in time and try to fix this. Too much damage has been done. My brother will lie to cover himself.

Also the minute someone starts calling me names,  the relationship is dead. Unless that person made a very sincere apology.", "NTA. Your SIL is irrational. Why would she expect a woman who doesn\u2019t talk to her brother to host a baby shower for his wife that she also doesn\u2019t have a relationship with? It literally makes no sense. Your sister hosted a shower for you because  you are close. Where were her friends and family? \nI personally would not expose myself or my baby to your SIL\u2019s childish behavior. Until she learns to manage her emotions like an adult I would avoid her and her drama.", "NTA - Her anger is clearly misplaced and rooted in jealousy. However - Maybe you can put some extra effort into showing your niece that you love her when you\u2019re able to. I know that time is limited with a new baby. It might not help with your SIL issue, but at least your niece will know that she\u2019s loved by you as she grows up.", "Sounds like SIL just wants to be mad about something.

Of course you\u2019re NTA.", "NTA and your SIL is bat shit crazy.", "Heck no NTA.  Your SIL needs therapy or, at minimum, an appointment with a family doctor to discuss her irritable mood.  That level of resentment is not healthy.  Distance yourself from the negativity and enjoy your baby.", "I suggest you talk to your brother.  Tell him absolutely everything his wife has been saying to you. Everything she is mad about is because of him but she's punishing you for it. \n\nHe needs to know \n\nA)    that she feels that way, under normal circumstances I would say it's her place to tell him how she feels but she is absolutely making it your business. \n\nB)   that she's treating you like crap (period).\n\nC)   that she's treating you like crap over something you have zero control over.\n\nD)   *that she's obsessively jealous over how your baby is treated*.

But seriously, the reason she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with anyone is HER fault. She\u2019s horrible.", "NTA. I understand feeling sidelined in the family you married into. It must be very painful for her to realize that the relationship she wants aren't ones that she can have. However, that is in no way your fault or your responsibility considering that you are someone who is showing up for her. The person who's going to suffer the most in this is your nephew, because your sister-in-law seems to determined to drive every other family member away. If you don't want to be here around her anymore, that would be completely understandable. No one has any right to treat you like this, for any reason.", "NTA. I'm very close with my in-laws, and it was still **MY** family who threw my baby shower. To expect someone that you aren't even close to in any regard to plan your shower is just delusional. SIL needs help on why she's so dead set on your sister being her person. She married your brother for him, not for his sister.", "NTA - does she not have a relationship with her own family?  Does she not have any friends willing to host a shower?  That\u2019s kinda sad.", "NTA She has issues. Nothing to do with you. She needs help.", "Probably not a coincidence that she has no one else to throw her a baby shower. She\u2019s awful. NTA.", "NTA. Your \"family\" looks like the family your SIL wants. You can't get the benefits of a close relationship if you haven't put in the work to cultivate a close relationship. It's completely irrational of her to expect your sister to be her sister if she hasnt even had a conversation with her.  She could have remedied this years ago, but she didn't, and now she is upset she doesn't have sister benefits.", "NTA but could you tell us what\u2019s going on between your siblings? If you are willing to share that information.", "NAH. But I do feel bad for your SIL. It sounds like your entire family doesn\u2019t treat her or your niece very well. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t your fault at all, but why did nobody step up and throw a shower for her (and your brother?) I can understand your sister not but your mom definitely should have.
