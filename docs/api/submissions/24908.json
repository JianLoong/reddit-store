But now he is just so disrespectful idk what to do. He brought ants into our house by constantly leaving messes, so I asked him nicely multiple times not to leave plates or opened bags of food on MY couch overnight, which he still does, he eats off my plates then leaves them dirty even tho the dishwasher is empty, he doesn\u2019t pay rent or any utilities, every single day from literally 10am-1am is on the couch in the living room watching or playing ufc on MY tv and couch which I wouldn\u2019t mind but it\u2019s now 95 degrees outside and my bedroom is the only room in the house with 0 AC cuz it's too small the smallest in the house as they get the huge master room so I cannot be in there. Anytime I ask him if I can watch it play something he tries to go around it like play ufc with me, which I suck at and hate. If I even get a chance to get my Xbox in the living room before he does after literlaly 2 rounds of games he's like \u201cSo when's my turn\u201d. And if all of this wasn\u2019t bad enough, the literal day that I stopped smoking weed he smoked ALL of the stuff I had left which was close to 50$ worth and refused to pay me for it, then went into my bedroom searching for more and opened my pill containers to find stuff I hid awhile ago, and again won\u2019t pay me for it. He\u2019s home while roomies at work, he\u2019s home 24/7 n doesn\u2019t leave. He also puts his raw meat on top of my veggies or cheese while knowing I\u2019m a vegetarian then it leaks all over it, when he could\u2019ve just moved some stuff or put it somewhere else. And he literally will not leave me alone the second I get off work, literally follows me into my room when I go to try and nap. He also won\u2019t even let me go to the bathroom without following me the door talking about weird stuff. He\u2019s way too comfortable talking to me about sex and other things as well for the time I\u2019ve known him. I\u2019m getting so pissed I wanna move out already but we have a year lease. And now he\u2019s officially moving in not on the lease. I talked to the landlord and they said I can break my lease if she finds another roommate. Ive tried to talk to my roommate but they get mad at me saying they\u2019ll cleanup and other stuff. I think I\u2019m going to tell the landlord she found a new roommate aka her boyfriend. But they will most likely explode on me as they already think I\u2019m a bitch for asking to cleanup and other stuff.

If you are uncomfortable in your own home you should just leave. You don't owe anyone anything.", "NTA This is very concerning.   Him following you around the house to your room and the bathroom?  Stealing from your room?  Disrespecting your couch and TV?  Talking to you about sex?  Cross contaminating your food in the fridge.  I would feel VERY unsafe in this environment.  You should have told your room mate you didn't want him there as soon as he started stealing.   You need to get out of there.  You have grounds to break the lease, you never agreed to him as a room mate and he creates a filthy and unsafe environment.", "NTA. Just do it. Move out.", "NTA - *\"I think I\u2019m going to tell the landlord she found a new roommate aka her boyfriend\"* \\- As you should. They violated the lease agreement long before you did. Leave without any guilt.", "NTA, I think you will have to work on coming to them one more time in a very mature \u201cI feel\u2026\u201d type of way. if that really leads to no changes, you are not the asshole if you want to get out of that weird and unfair situation", "NTA -Hell, your roommate doesn\u2019t have a BF, she has a freeloading mooch. Why she is putting up with him is not your problem. It must be excruciating living with those two. \n\nThe BF\u2019s disrespect of you and your belongings is off the charts. Move out ASAP- it is never going to get better. The BF has free rent, sex, video games, drugs & food-everything an asshole like him needs. Move!", "nta\u2026 to be blunt here, so what if they blow up, they sound like miserable human beings, who cares what they think? i\u2019m sorry, this is a terrible situation, i hope you get resolution soon.", "nta. he's being very demanding for someone who is a guest.  There is no reason you should restrict your space/time for him. (especially with your stuff)", "NTA. \n\nIf you are uncomfortable then you have every right to leave. Tell the landlord the boyfriend is moving in. It's their problem once you move out. You shouldn't have to feel uncomfortable in your own home.", "NTA\n\nCheck the lease for what it says about overnight guests etc. she can either let you out of the lease to put her boyfriend on it/another friend who will tolerate that BS or you can pursue it more aggressively that she\u2019s violating the lease and try to kick her out and find a new roommate yourself.\n\nHe is completely disrespecting you and they together are taking advantage of you. Basically you are just paying half the rent to make it cheaper for THEM to live together.\n\nIf all else fails - You could also be petty and just move all your communal space belongings like your couch and Tv to storage and keep only a smaller TV in your bedroom. Change your doorknob to have a key lock on it. Use paper plates so he stops ruining and dirtying yours. Yes, it\u2019s insanely petty but when suddenly the nice things they keep taking for granted and ruining aren\u2019t there, maybe they\u2019ll take better care of their own things.\n\nIf you are stuck there 10 more months - just make sure you make it VERY clear to the landlord and roommate in about 7/8 months (2-3 before renewal) that you will not be renewing and put it in writing.", "You're not the asshole for wanting to break your lease because your roommate's boyfriend is a disrespectful freeloader. I'd say you're the only one with some sense in this situation\n\nWho does this guy think he is? Bringing ants into the house, eating off your plates, and messing up your couch? And then hogging your TV and couch all day long like he owns the place. It's your TV, your couch, and your sanity that's being compromised here.\n\nThen he has the nerve to invade your personal space, following you around like some lost puppy, talking about inappropriate crap, and even going through your stuff. That's just creepy AF and disrespectful.\n\nYou have every right to want to get the hell out of there. Don't let anyone guilt trip you into staying in a toxic environment. If the landlord says you can break the lease if your roommate finds a replacement, then by all means, inform the landlord that her boyfriend is moving in. Let them explode all they want. You deserve to live in peace, without some obnoxious, boundary-crossing boyfriend ruining your life.\n\nYou're NTA. You're the victim of an obnoxious boyfriend and a roommate who can't seem to see the obvious. Get out of there and find yourself a better living situation. Good luck dealing with these idiots.", "NTA.  Tell the landlord about him following you to your room and the bathroom and talking to you about sex and making you feel *unsafe*.

We agreed to keep things clean when we were moving in together and that he\u2019d stay sometimes the night every now and then. Not that he\u2019d be a full blown creep and living with us.

Much better for you to be out and somewhere safe, but where you don't have to pay a second set of rent, while this is getting sorted out.
