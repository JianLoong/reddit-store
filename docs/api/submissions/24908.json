But now he is just so disrespectful idk what to do. He brought ants into our house by constantly leaving messes, so I asked him nicely multiple times not to leave plates or opened bags of food on MY couch overnight, which he still does, he eats off my plates then leaves them dirty even tho the dishwasher is empty, he doesn\u2019t pay rent or any utilities, every single day from literally 10am-1am is on the couch in the living room watching or playing ufc on MY tv and couch which I wouldn\u2019t mind but it\u2019s now 95 degrees outside and my bedroom is the only room in the house with 0 AC cuz it's too small the smallest in the house as they get the huge master room so I cannot be in there. Anytime I ask him if I can watch it play something he tries to go around it like play ufc with me, which I suck at and hate. If I even get a chance to get my Xbox in the living room before he does after literlaly 2 rounds of games he's like \u201cSo when's my turn\u201d. And if all of this wasn\u2019t bad enough, the literal day that I stopped smoking weed he smoked ALL of the stuff I had left which was close to 50$ worth and refused to pay me for it, then went into my bedroom searching for more and opened my pill containers to find stuff I hid awhile ago, and again won\u2019t pay me for it.

And he literally will not leave me alone the second I get off work, literally follows me into my room when I go to try and nap. He also won\u2019t even let me go to the bathroom without following me the door talking about weird stuff. He\u2019s way too comfortable talking to me about sex and other things as well for the time I\u2019ve known him. I\u2019m getting so pissed I wanna move out already but we have a year lease. And now he\u2019s officially moving in not on the lease. I talked to the landlord and they said I can break my lease if she finds another roommate. Ive tried to talk to my roommate but they get mad at me saying they\u2019ll cleanup and other stuff. I think I\u2019m going to tell the landlord she found a new roommate aka her boyfriend.
