I know I'm big but I don't think it should really affect how I dress. I get sweaty at the gym and the one thing worse than a sweaty bra is a shirt that sticks to you because of sweat. My gym also doesn't have air conditioning on a low enough temperature for me to avoid getting like this. For reference, my gym doesn't have a dress code.\n\nAs a result, for most of my workouts, I've opted to just go in my bra and leggings or shorts. Today was chest and back and I chose to wear my bra and shorts combo. No cleavage is showing, no underwear is peaking out above the shorts, it's what a lot of the other girls I've seen at the gym wear. I'm going through my workout and by the time I get to the bench press I notice some people in the corner giving me the side eye.\n\nI try to ignore them and turn up my music, but I can still see them just staring at me unhappily. I finish a set when one of the girls in the group approach me and asks me to put on a shirt. She states that it's unsanitary. I say that I wipe down all the equipment before and after use. She says it doesn't matter and that I needed to be more polite to other gym members.\n\nAt this point I already knew she was most likely talking about not wanting to see my rolls.

Schools typically take these matters seriously, it's probably worth making a note of the interaction if nothing else.", "I can understand how difficult it may be to have to tell the gym about this but I strongly encourage you to do it. It\u2019s not your job to worry about what they do with the information. Ask yourself if you\u2019re looking for reasons to avoid confrontation or embarrassment.\n\nIf I were a business owner and knew that people were making my customers feel unwelcome I would absolutely wanna hear about it. If I ran a school and knew students were making each other feel unwelcome in public shared spaces then I would damn sure wanna know about it.\n\nYou deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, which is asking for literally *nothing* in this scenario as you have the reasonable expectation of people minding their own business, which costs nothing. You weren\u2019t hurting anyone or violating any rules and you don\u2019t deserve that shit.", "Don't worry, they will manufacture something", "They're not feigning, they actually feel superior.  They're just wrong.", "Sigh. Very true. \n\nI was a very large gal until I was in my 30s. I lost a total of about 135 pounds. I still have some jiggle but it\u2019s not too bad. I was very self conscious about going to the gym but I did it. I did end up quitting the gym because it was too expensive. We had all kinds of people there and I never saw any idiots that made any insensitive comments because the gym had very strict policies about harassment.\n\nI do believe people treat large people differently because I saw for myself how different I\u2019m treated now than I was then.", "Same here! People love talking shit about it but I love PF. Even as a smaller \"fit looking\" person I feel so much more comfortable being surrounded by normal people. It's truly a variety of all sorts of people and there's no judgements; everyone is just there to improve themselves at a pace that's good for them. No egos, no weird stuff, everyone is just focused on their own workouts. Those \"superior\" gyms make me feel intimidated and uncomfortable.", "Yeah its kinda like reading the news on any given day. \ud83e\udee0", "Very true!\n\nI thank you, kind internet stranger, for the addition!", "My cat is one kilo overweight and I\u2019m trying so hard to help him lose it but it\u2019s so hard when he meows at me desperately and follows me around ! How do people do it I wanna cry", "Same! My boy is just a tall gentleman. The vet says he is a little skinny!", "You look strong as hell. Wear whatever the fuck you want!", "Oh, FFS, that girl can eat a bag of dicks.", "Yeah, that\u2019s a completely appropriate outfit. Girl, you snatched.", "OP, if you enjoy barbells and ever get sick of having to share a gym with assholes, look around for a gym devoted to powerlifting. I\u2019ve gone to some and the athletes come in every size imaginable, from guys who look like they weigh 90 lbs (but who can deadlift 600+) to girls significantly larger than you (and not trying to lose a pound) who are prize-winning competitive athletes.  Nobody would blink at you in that outfit.", "Omg forreal?? Girl, you look so STRONG!! Keep it up!", "Im gonna be honest you dont really look \u201cfat\u201d at all, your big but you just look built and its not like your stuffed into that outfit", "Wait, that post is you and close to what you were wearing?? \n\nNothing wrong at all and congratulations on losing 18lbs! \n\nI see bigger gals with less on at the grocery store. NTA at all.", "Dude, not even close to being \na problem. Keep killing it and doing your thing. Most folks in the gym are there for the business. I'm always stoked to see every body shape and charactristic in the gym because we're all in the same journey \ud83d\udcaa", "That is awesome. If I saw you working out I probably would approach you, but only to tell you your hair is cool \ud83e\udd13", "My opinion is NTA, yet sweaty benches really sucks. It is a good thing to use a towel to cover it if you\u2019re wet, regardless of t-shirt being on. Just as a respect to other people:)", "Is that the story behind your username", "They didn't do any name calling?", "Omg did you create this account just to hate on OP? Yikes.", "Your logic is inconsistent.  You feel uncomfortable when people show skin, but in some places it's ok.  \n\n\nLike, we all get that you are unhinged.  But at least keep your story straight.", "Sports bras ain\u2019t sexual and there was nothing sexual about what OP was doing or what most women at the gym are doing.", "What would be more sanitary than wiping down the freaking machines? Sweat goes through clothing anyways!", "It could be similar to the Uni gym near me, students get a massive discount but its also open to paying members of the public. These are the ones who actually keep the gym going, the do not want to lose that business.", "I love this! And you\u2019re absolutely correct in your strategy. These hateful jerks need to be chased back under their rock.", "Most college/uni students have a gym membership in their semester fees, they just don't take it up much. I know every full-time student in my school pays every term they're enrolled", "This is why I exercise on a stationary bike and my normal bike. OP is braver than I am. I am 5'4'' and 246 lbs and have lost about 47 pounds in the past 2 years. I tried gyms before and was just not comfortable with the judgement and comments. I've found something that works for me. You go OP and feel free to tell anyone who gives you undeserved crap to kick rocks. (NTA obviously.)", "I used to be overweight and was very self-conscious around people I considered thin. Now I\u2019m pretty thin due to distance running, and going to the gym still sucks because everyone there is huge and veiny and bulging. At least when I was heavy I looked stronger. Now going to the gym feels like SpongeBob trying to get into the salty spitoon", "As a fat person, I would legit pay extra for a fat people gym. Exact same reason Curves was so popular in the oughts.", "So is the \u201clunk alarm\u201d for real? I\u2019ve heard of PF kicking people out of their gyms for things like grunting while lifting, or god forbid randomly drop a weight. It\u2019s like they expect you to half-ass your workouts rather than take it seriously. And what kind of gym has pizza nights?", "Would like to add the the planet fitness thing. And tbh you can do everything you need with a smith machine if you have no spot. Ignore the machines and you\u2019re fine. \n\nBut tbf I really do not care about others staring at me at the gym , I really encourage people to work on that aspect as well.", "I think we all notice very attractive people a little. I would say about 50% of the people at my planet fitness are attractive and the other 50% only look a little better than me.", "The Bible has a lot of fun verses that its fans don\u2019t like.  Like Judge not lest ye be judged; it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven; and There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses.", "I'm wondering if it's the marks she says she has from picking at her skin. They may think she has an infection that could be contagious. A lot of people don't trust the gym wipes to kill off stuff like ringworm. That's the only thing I can think of. It doesn't hurt to put a towel down on the seat or backrest even if you're wearing a shirt, especially if you're particularly sweaty.", "It still exists, just pretending not to be a disgusting hateful rat hole anymore. I don't remember the new name but it's all \"funny\" videos of fat people falling, failing at things and hurting themselves.", "there was one called \"thinspo\" short for \"thinsporaition\"...basically pictures of anorexic women, praising them for having the ideal body type. They always hid behind the claim that their motivation was to body shame fat people in to being thinner so that they would be healthier...it was all done with good intentions.", "Hi I\u2019m fat and fyi this gym kind of exists at your local YMCA/JCC/other community center type of place. It\u2019s not exclusively fat people but there are always lots of us. and lots of older people and disabled people working out too. it\u2019s a very different vibe from places that are just a gym in my experience.", "Wasn't that kind of the model that Curves originally had? Marketing to larger women?", "Do you! I totally understand the anxiety that the gym holds over people in general. Grab it by the gonads, so to speak and you will feel so much better not caring what someone thinks. All that truly matters, as long as\nyou\u2019re not hurting yourself or someone else is what YOU think! Good luck \ud83c\udf40", "I definitely get that. There's a place called curves that is more of a gym for heavier woman. I put on nearly 40 lbs in the last 5 yrs so I wanted to try to lose it. I don't want to go to the regular gym but I tried going to curves and I guess I wasn't heavy enough for the woman there bc they all gave me side eye. I feel like I just don't fit in so I gave up and just started by watching what I eat. I'm 10lbs down after 3 months!", "I'm in great shape and I'd still go to the \"fat gym\" to avoid the instagrammers. Plus I'd be too afraid to try new things in the snooty gym. Took me forever to even get the confidence to go near a pullup bar because previously I wasn't able to do one and I was terrified I'd get up there, grab, and just dangle for a few seconds. By the time I was brave enough to even try one I could do a half dozen. Could have been working on that way earlier.", "Omg... the fucking mirrors. Pure torture.\n\nMy tiny local gym is ok... but there have been a few times these two women come in and just chat, sitting on the few machines, one leisurely doing sets while the other stands or sits on another machine talking. So rude. When you only have one of everything for weights, three treadmills and two ellipticals, you need to be more considerate. Go get a coffee and gossip, dont waste precious gym space.", "I feel like that's the YMCA probably. The last time I was at one was for a bench press competition that was just the most chill thing ever. I had been training with my friend for about a year as a means to talk nerd shit and give myself a number to focus on that wasn't my body weight. Everyone congratulated everyone on their work. Best moments were grandkids with signs rooting on their grandpa in the super senior division and three elderly men rooting on an elderly woman they clearly worked out with regularly to bench 80 lbs. Everyone was at varying levels of fitness and no one was being a hyper competitive meanie.", "What about fat people who aren't workout beginners?", "Why do you think someone saying good job is virtue signalling?\n\nAre you honestly so jaded that you don't believe that there are people out there that are so pumped themselves that they honestly truly are happy for you and want to support others.", "It exists, but I've never heard it go off. I get not wanting people to toss around weights or be obnoxiously grunting. It's not like they use it for occasional quiet grunts.\n\n\nAnd tbf if you're accidentally dropping a weight you probably shouldn't be using it anyway.", "Agree. I obviously observe people when I'm at the gym but I hope no one ever thinks I'm focusing on them or anything creepy, lol.", "So then, by your logic, why don\u2019t YOU be the one to have some consideration, and accommodate an overweight person? At the gym? Appropriately trying to lose weight? In an acceptable environment? BY NOT LOOKING IN HER DIRECTION! BCUZ IT BOTHERS YOUR EYES! Why cant you be the one to accommodate your actions for her benefit? \ud83e\udd14", "why do you have the opinion though? like sure you're allowed to be uncomfortable but why does like make her an asshole?", "Oh, there's still fatpeoplelogic as far as I'm aware. It's so gross.", "Oh yea and there was this obvious hateful fiction all over it you could tell because the stories had too many minute details and over explanations \ud83d\ude44", "Every single sub centered around bullying needs to be banned. That's just awful.", "I'll have to look into it! Thanks!", "Completely true, but so hard to get that in your head sometimes.", "I love this \u2764\ufe0f", "I just always took it for women in general, didn't pick up on the larger women vibe. It didn't really last long in my area.", "This right here. I have lifted since I was a young teen. I know people that work out 5 days a week that are fat. Go look at any professional weight lifter.", "If they go out of their way to single out the only fat person at the gym then it's just shitty, and with additional context that is what it is.  There are some that are genuine, but enough that are not and that sucks.\n\nAlso, their assumptions that I don't workout is really awful. I'm at the gym five days a week and do not miss lifting ever. Talking at me and telling I should come regularly after 4 years is just garbage.", "God it\u2019s so shitty", "Yeah it was really sad. And a lot of people in that sub were themselves fat. It could be a very weird self loathing or projection thing. Kinda like how many of the people who bullied Chris Chan were themselves autistic.", "Been there, done that.  I commented one above you. I'm finally loosing weight but doing it mainly on a stationary bike instead of a gym (watching what I eat of course). I have an anxiety disorder and have enough stressers in my life as it is. Maybe when I get back down a bit more I'll try a gym again. Find what works for you and don't give up. (I'm 43 and finally managing this. :)  )", "I\u2019d love to be out of bed and getting ready for the morning walk with my dog but honestly, the best I can manage is 6:20 am, which is pretty good. A 4 am nap in a massage chair sounds great!", "In addition, many bodybuilders - the ones who pose in competition - put on an extra 30 or so pounds between competitions, as the extra cushions their bodies, provides energy during longer workouts, and allows them the extra nutrition for building muscle underneath.", "No you weren\u2019t. You were being judgmental. It\u2019s okay to admit you were wrong.", "Do you know what a sports bra is?", "If someone is fatter than you, then they are the target. You get to join the crowd and are insulated from the *worst* of the vitriol by steering them at someone larger to attack. \n\nOnce you\u2019re in that group it\u2019s addicting. You get the praise and validation you never got before because people are shitty and base too much on looks. On the internet no one can see you so you\u2019re \u201csafe.\u201d \n\nAt least, until **your** picture ends up in that same group and the people who supported your comments before obliterate you with hate, all because of how you look. \n\n*I am using the generic \u201cyou,\u201d not saying it\u2019s the person I\u2019m replying to or *anyone else in this group or anyone who commented above.* I hate that I have to include this but we all know Reddit\u2019s gonna reddit.*", "He's only seen one from afar never actually touched one"]}
