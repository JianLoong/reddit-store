I (24F) am getting married in Feb '24.I was supposed to get married in Oct '24, but changed the date due to my MIL suffering w/ strokes & recently had a bad episode. My fiance asked if we could change the date due to things drs told us. so we changed it.. only a few people had known the original date. Just my parents & immediate family. When we decided to change it (this Monday) I immediately reached out to who knew & let them know the change. \n\nWhen I texted Kayla (F20 my cousin not sister) she asked why I changed it & fiance asked me not to tell everyone about my MIL since he didn't want my MIL to be their topic of gossip(my fam loves to talk) So, I just explained how after our wedding were gonna be traveling & once we returned, we planned on moving as that's when our lease ends & i didn't want to be stressed abt moving 3 days before my big day. i also let her know we specifically chose a 3 day wkd to help accommodate the ppl coming from out of state. THEN She told me she was planning to do a bday party for my niece & asked how come I didn't ask her before I changed the date. I apologized & stated I didn\u2019t know & I let her know as soon as we changed it; & she never responded to me. I figured she was upset so I let it be. \n\nDays passed & dad called to tell me Kayla called him to let him know she wasn't changing the bday party & demand I change my date.

I asked him if he stood up for me at all & just responded with he was just the messenger & didn't want to be involved. I let him know he was involved the moment they called him.

I let him know majority of our relatives had already rsvp'd & he replied with \"well don't depend on them because they're gonna flake on you\". & left it at that.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 doesn't want to move the wedding date & he was irritated about the situation. I understand I changed the date & own that but I'm hurt that Kayla didn't talk to me about it, she left me on read and then just went to calling my dad especially knowing I don\u2019t have a good relationship w him.

Yes that might be her daughter\u2019s actual birthday but ffs, the child is 1. She won\u2019t remember, and the 1 year birthday is more for the parents who survived the first year (which is obviously why Kayla cares so hard).\n\nWeddings are A YEAR OR MORE of planning, and of course you\u2019ll end up picking a date that doesn\u2019t work for everyone. That\u2019s life. Their sheer unwillingness to talk to you about it is why I\u2019m leaning NTA. No matter what you did, it wouldn\u2019t be right. \n\nI have a feeling Kayla is used to walking over people and getting her way, and you were always forced to accommodate? The fact that she\u2019s now making this into a fight is insane.", "NTA.  There are only so many days in the year and only so many of them are usable for a wedding.  There will always be a conflict.  Sounds like your event was  announced first.  Folks can choose.  You can\u2019t pick a perfect date for everyone.  Your dad is a AH.", "I always say the people who show up are the people that matter.  When the time comes for your wedding and Ur family are a no show.  Tell them u will not be there for them when they need it as you have other commitments that day x", "NTA ridiculous they expect you to change for a damn kids birthday.", "NTA, this is months away and she can easily move a birthday party for a 1 year old that doesn\u2019t even know what day it is.", "NTA. Kayla could easily shift the date for your niece\u2019s birthday party to the day before or after. I\u2019d get it if it was booked and she was going to remember it, but she\u2019s going to be 1 y/o. Sounds like a power trip and your Dad\u2019s reaction suggests she gets away with it more often than not.\n\nYou do what\u2019s right for you and your fianc\u00e9. If they don\u2019t show on one of the biggest days of your life, that will tell you everything you need to know about how much they value you as a person and family member.", "Kayla doesn't want it to work.

So it seems she did mention to you she was doing a party before you told everyone else in your family. You just didn't care to hear it and moved on with that date anyway?", "With the way these people treat you why are the even invited to your wedding?

A one-year-old will never remember their party, and a wedding takes precedence way before.  Most (all?} children's parties are during the day, she can hold it during the day like every other parent.

When my oldest son turned one, I was away on a training course with the military and missed his actual birthday. I was home a week later. Guess what? We had the party  a week later. First birthdays are not for the child, they're for the family.

It is a birthday party for a one year old. Give her a cupcake and take some cute photos before getting dressed for the wedding and she'll be super happy.\n\nThe real reason she won't be flexible is with doing it the day before or after is she doesn't want to share the spotlight with you on your wedding day and the fact that you even offered to have a cake at your own wedding for the baby prob makes her even more mad. And I'm saying her spotlight not the baby because I can't stress this enough: her child does not care or know it's her birthday.", "What? This is crazy, sorry wedding trumps birthday party for a kid that won\u2019t remember it.", "NTA.  Have the wedding.  Tell them they don\u2019t have to come.

You say how terrible Kayla and her sister are and how you\u2019d gone NC for awhile, yet you planned to have them all in the wedding?  Not sure why you\u2019d do that.

They don\u2019t sound like great people so maybe you\u2019re better off going back to the NC.\n\nBut my point stands that if you don\u2019t tell people the reason, you can\u2019t also be hurt that they don\u2019t acknowledge the good reason? That clearly makes no sense.", "if my MIL\u2019s doctors are telling us that her memory is gonna be deteriorated by the time of our original wedding date, yeah I\u2019m gonna move it up for my fianc\u00e9 cause he deserves to have his mom there at his wedding. The moment we figured it out I did text them, literally minutes after, she never once said she planned a bday party. Never once told me anything, I assumed Disneyland like she told me a month ago.

Her own sister didn\u2019t know if anything was being planned cause she assumed Disneyland too.", "Gift grab.", "It\u2019s like a secular alternative to a baptism so that you can still get all your people together despite leaving the religious event behind.\n\nLike the other commenter said though, for someone like OP\u2019s sister, it\u2019s just a gift grab.", "I thought that's what some people call funerals.

When I announced I was engaged, Kayla and her sister both asked me if they could be a bridesmaid.  \nShe originally wanted to go to Disneyland for her bday, so that\u2019s what I had assumed since she hadn\u2019t said anything else about it until the day I said I was changing the date.", "After this, I am.

She\u2019s done it once before and when I sent my dad the screenshots he laughed about it on social media and proceeded to take their side and that\u2019s why I cut them off for a few years at 18.. then a few years later my grandpa had a heart attack and that\u2019s the only reason why I came back & my dad apologized and said It wouldn\u2019t happen again and I have a feeling if my dad is gonna pick, he\u2019s not choosing me that\u2019s for sure. He\u2019s never picked me over his sister.

But you\u2019re not telling people that!  You\u2019re saying it\u2019s because of travel, moving, etc.\n\nAnd it\u2019s literally the weekend of the baby\u2019s birthday.  I get why she hadn\u2019t announced a party 5 months in advance, even if it was something she had in mind.

So I guess it\u2019ll all sort itself out.", "Have they replied to you? Are you ok? I'm sure it's very hard and stressful for you.", "You deserve a parent who has your back.  I am sorry your father has disappointed you.\n\nIs there any way to stay in contact with your grandfather, and not your father?  \n\nCan you illuminate or reduce your SM presence so that the attempt to lie or shame you won't affect you?  Can you block your aunt, cousins and father?\n\nHave a wonderful wedding.  Enjoy yourself.  You are starting a new life with your partner.", "No, no one has texted or called me. They\u2019re watching my social media like a hawk, always the first ones to see whatever I\u2019m posting.. but no response.

I\u2019m realizing Weddings are gonna piss people off no matter what, everyone\u2019s always gonna have a birthday no matter what month I pick..", "Sounds like overall you were unfortunately better off no contact", "Yes I agree. There is no reason to have these people in your life when they make you feel the way you do. Block them and move on hun"]}
