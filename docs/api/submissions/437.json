Even though I worked 7 hours and my boyfriend was off, I drove his new Tesla (a car I am less confident driving than my car) so I\u2019m exhausted.\n\nWe decided at 5am to go to bed until around 7am, so that we could see the sunrise from the balcony, and then sleep in. We get in bed and he pulls out a book while I fall asleep. I am a deep sleeper while my boyfriend is not.\n\nAt 7am I am awoken to see the sunrise, it is gorgeous and while I am normally grumpy upon waking up, I thank my boyfriend for waking me before going back to bed.\n\nAt 9:30am I wake up alone, and call his name. Hearing no answer, I call out again. Call it anxiety or trust issues (he is still in the process of earning my trust back, not because of explicit cheating but because of old messaging with my coworker, and my ex left me with trust issues that I have {proudly} 80% overcome, set back by my boyfriend\u2019s actions with others) my mind begins to panic.\n\nI get out of bed, walk into the doorway of the living room and am hit by the volume of the vent fan (a noise he uses to sleep). I shout his name, before seeing him sit up from the couch in the living room. (He apparently never really went to sleep once I did at 5am, he woke me up at 7am and then did work stuff on his laptop until I woke up.)\n\nHe is instantly mad at me for yelling at him, and in my panicked, just-woke-up stupor (did I mention I CAN be an admitted bitch for 5-10 minutes after I wake up), I mirrored his anger and yelled that I was just worried about where he was. He, as a 39-year-old, private-schooled, only-child man, doesn\u2019t like to be told what to do. So he countered with something along the lines of, \u201cso what if I had gone to get coffee for us? Or breakfast? Would you be mad then?\u201d \n\nHonestly, yes. Because\n\nA. He left me in a condo complex while he took our only car, and\n\nB.

Him calling me possessive and controlling for not letting him go wherever he wants when he can\u2019t sleep, and me saying that I don\u2019t care when he takes drives at home, but we are on vacation together and I deserve to have the option of being included.
