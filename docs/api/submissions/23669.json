Your dad and his wife had plenty of time to introduce you to the girls on their terms.", "NTA\n\nMade me laugh, you should put this on pettyrevenge !", "NTA. Dad and the twins mom are the AH. Shitty way for the twins to find out but it would\u2019ve happened sooner or later. The twins asked you answered. Were you instructed to lie? No. They made their bed they can lie in it.", "NTA Why should you have to lie about who you are to your little sisters? You aren't a dirty secret, you are a person.", "NTA. They could have introduced you at any time, they just hoped that if they ignored you long enough you might vanish. Which was stupid since you're clearly in the same school district.\n\nNone of this is your fault.", "NTA, lol. Your dad certainly FAFO on that one.\n\nIf he wants to set boundaries and keep his kids totally separate, that's his business. Maybe he shouldn't have enrolled the kids he replaced you with in the same district.\n\nTell your relatives that expecting a 17-year-old to be more coy and mature than an adult man with at least three kids makes them all look extremely foolish.\n\nAlso, sincerely, your dad sucks. Blowing up your phone like that as if you had anything to do with him being a deadbeat and choosing to lie to his shiny new family and pretend he never threw his old one away like dirty tissues.\n\nYou don't owe that man anything, or any of the people that make excuses for him.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry. My father played \u2018happy family\u2019 with his affair family. His son still doesn\u2019t know about us, never will (hopefully), and even though my relationship with him is on the mend, I will never forget the sense of injustice I feel seeing him treat his other side the way he never did treat my mum and my siblings.\n\nIt just shows how much your father cares about you to the point where he calls you just to yell at you for telling your siblings you exist. It\u2019s sad that the children didn\u2019t know you exist, but the truth will come out eventually. Don\u2019t listen to his comments and stay strong. You deserve better.", "NTA  Your dad, his wife and his family have absolutely no legitimate reason to be mad at you.  It is a true fact that you are his daughter.  The children asked why you have the same last name and you answered them honestly.  There is nothing wrong with what you said or did.  Your dad and his family are complete jerks.  He does not seem to be worth your time.  He is a small, mean man.  Just remember, his treatment of you is not your fault.  He is just a poor excuse of a man with a mean side.", "NTA. Tell him his other daughters should know he's the sort of man who abandons his kids the moment he's not screwing their mom- they deserve fair warning so they can prepare for when he gets bored with their family and wants a new one. Then block him on everything.", "NTA, fuck em.", "NTA- from the sounds of it you\u2019d be good for them to know anyway.  \nThis falls under the category of best tell before they find out from somebody else and um they really like this go on for too long. I mean, what did they expect?", "NTA never an asshole for telling the truth", "NTA you did right by the twins.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell done!", "Yes, YTA.  But in a good way.

There is absolutely no reason to act as if you believe your dad's bullshit, especially because buying into it is probably going to be harmful to your mental health. \n\nYou owe it to yourself NOT to act like someone's dirty secret!!

Speaking as the fellow child of a deadbeat dad with younger twin half-siblings who i don't really know, if I had been in your position I like to imagine that I would have done exactly the same thing.

I'm not thrilled with your execution. Sounds like you dumped two young kids into a pretty ugly conversation with their parents. If it was just the adults who were made uncomfortable I'd be less iffy about this, but doing that to six year olds....\n\nHowever, you're also fairly young, and this situation was kinda dropped on you - and also, really, your sisters should know about you.
