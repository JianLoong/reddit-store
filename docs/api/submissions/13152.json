This whole post is seething with anger and resentment over something that could have been handled quite easily with just a bit patience.\n\nDid the chef do your wrong? Perhaps. Or maybe he just lost track of orders on a busy morning. Regardless, all you had to do is place your order the second time and stand there waiting a couple of minutes while he made the eggs. But no, you seem to enjoy being angry.\n\n---\n\nEdit: a word. their -> there", "Yes, YTA.\n\nWhy do you need to \"talk stern and ask him why he's being so unprofessional\"? \n\nMaybe he didn't hear you the first time, maybe he was already making eggs for others and you jumped the queue. \n\nFor your GF to ask you not to make a scene, indicates that in the past, you've made a scene. \n\nIt's just eggs buddy, move on.", "YTA.\n\n1. You act like the chef was trying to wrong you on purpose. Either it was an honest mistake, they were super busy, or you have been a dick before which is why they would do that.\n2. Your GF was up there 5-7 minutes waiting for your eggs. That's really nice of her. You don't seem to appreciate that. \n3. You show up to pick a fight with the chef. Telling them off isn't needed. Clearly they were busy. Get over yourself.\n4. Your GF knows you are going to make a scene and doesn't want to be embarrassed. This is reasonable. You don't seem to accept her concern is valid. \n5. You pick a fight instead of letting it go.\n6. Your GF looks at it from your perspective and apologized. That is a great quality and amazing of her considering you are pretty much causing the whole thing. You are holding a grudge anyway.\n\nAny one of the things about would make you TA. All of them and it's a big TA. And that's just what we know about. Get your stuff together, get anger management or learn to process your anger, or she will likely leave you (as she should). \n\nAnd BTW, your comments about alcohol do you no favors. Seeing you drunk enough to have concerns how you lash out is bad. And alcohol usually amplifies how you are anyway. You have anger and potentially alcohol problems.", "Eggs-actly YTA\n\n\u2018My intention was to be stern\u2019 and you have prior incidents of becoming aggressive and yelling at people\n\nYou say when drunk, unfortunately the drunk version of ourselves is the most honest\n\nI\u2019m sure you GF went into full anxiety over the eggs as you\u2019ve conditioned her that you go off at inconveniences \n\nGet some anger management sessions in, no one deserves your behaviour- sober or drunk and you \u2018could have been aggressive in the moment\u2019", "YTA Honestly the breakfast thing is trivial to get angry over, she's right you shouldn't be making a scene over eggs.", "YTA from the beginning of your post you're attributing everything to malice when it can be easily explained by stupidity. Try to learn to let things go.", "YTA - dude?  Like for real?  This was the hill to die on?", "Yta. Clearly there are some angry management issues here and your and your gf have a lot to talk about.\n\nAlso, clearly you've never worked in customer service...", "Yes, YTA! \nFrom your gf\u2019s comment it shows that it is common with you to pick fights with people.  Even her trying to go and speak with the chef meant she was trying to defuse the situation.", "YTA - the first thing in the morning and you\u2019re getting fired up over feeling ignored about your eggs. \n\nI get it, it\u2019s frustrating, but your gf saw signs in you that it could get out of hand and tried to prevent that from happening for both of your sakss", "YTA. If I, as a fully grown adult, had a romantic partner who felt the need to remind me not to make a scene at breakfast, I\u2019d be mortified. You should be too. You have let your anger issues control you to the point where your girlfriend feels the need to manage your emotions for you. You should really work on that, anger issues are not attractive.", "YTA. You sound incredibly childish. I strongly suggest you get therapy to learn how to maturely handle your emotions. \n>\nGetting angry over eggs is so incredibly dramatic and immature. \n>\nBut then getting angry at your gf because she didn\u2019t want you to make a scene is next level! Serious red flags here. I\u2019m shocked that your gf didn\u2019t dump you. My guess is that this relationship won\u2019t last much longer.", "YTA. You teach people how to treat you. You've taught your girlfriend to anticipate you aggressively exploding at strangers for a minor inconvenience.", "YTA are you kidding me?", "YTA. You are a compete asshole to your girlfriend but more so the chef! \u201cIt was breakfast time!\u201d \n\n\n***give me a fucking break***", "You said you had previous experiences that made her react like that, so it is justified. The fact that her first thought was that you would get aggressive makes me think you were already agitated at that moment. I think you should adress your own behavior and reactions. It is a shame your SO has to beware of how you react over some eggs.", "Going with YTA since your girlfriend asked you to not make a scene.", "YTA get some control on your behaviour because it\u2019s obvious you do this kind of thing often and your gf doesn\u2019t appreciate it. Yes you\u2019re an asshole for holding it against her when you\u2019re in the wrong.", "Yup YTA. Go apologise to your GF and tell her she needs to find someone better because you're not good enough for her.", "Why would he be pretending to not remember that you had ordered? He clearly made a mistake? You should get that persecutory delusion complex checked out. Your girlfriend clearly saved that guy from you ruining his morning over a little mistake. PS you shouldn\u2019t be surprised when she leaves you soon. YTA", "YTA\n\nThere is nothing wrong with being upset. But your reaction to being upset was the issue. \n\nHave you ever worked in the service industry? \n\nAnd your girlfriend did nothing wrong.  If I ever saw you disrespect a waiter, chef,  custodian, host, etc. I would have broken up with you on the spot . That's unattractive and disgusting.", "YTA.\n\nYou don't even need to read the story just read the title back to yourself dude.\n\nApologize to your gf, and thank for for trying to calm the situation on holiday.", "YTA. Your girlfriend asked you not to make a scene, and now you\u2019re angry with her for wanting to stay civil? And all of this over not getting your eggs quickly enough? You sound like hard work.", "Sorry mate but i think YTA with this one...\nMaybe you should apologize to your gf and take this like a life lesson\nHave a nice day", "YTA. You sound fun", "YTA \u2026 Go watch the first season of the white lotus and it\u2019ll be like looking in a mirror", "Yta. All this over some eggs?? Really? Is that really worth your energy? You don't need to be \"stern\" with another grown ass adult doing their job, they either probably made a mistake or was backed up on orders- either one can easily be solved with some patience. Get over yourself", "YTA\n\nLike, dude, based on this post it sounds like you're an entitled brat with anger issues. You might not be, but just from this info you sound like an asshole.", "YtA\n\nI like that you assume he was pretending. Shows the level of delusion you have.", "YTA, eggstremely.", "YTA. You quite clearly have anger problems and would do well to get some therapy. You don\u2019t need to have a \u2018stern talking to\u2019 a chef about eggs while on vacation.

On top of that you make your partner uncomfortable and then expect them to apologise for it ? Get some help.", "YTA\u2014Were you supposed to go up to the chef to place your order or were you supposed to order via a server? How many orders did the chef have before you?

I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not the fact time you\u2019ve behaved like this and I bet it won\u2019t be the last\u2026", "YTA. It\u2019s people like you that make working customer service so miserable. The fact that your gf just knew you were about to make a scene over something as small as eggs\u2026.says a lot about you. Try some anger management classes and apologize to your girlfriend.

If there was a 30 minute wait or so,etching the appropriate thing to do is ask if there\u2019s a technical or supply problem. The chef wants to serve you quick so he can serve the next guy.

And it will never stop pissing you off. In ten years something will remind you of that and you will still feel pissed about it.\n\nShe didn't make you though. You could have made a scene if you really wanted. But you chose not to so she would be happy so you kinda can't hold it against her. And if you do feel a little resentment about it keep it to yourself otherwise the whole exercise was pointless.", "NAH\n\nBut I don't get her not wanting to stay just because your friends will be away and there isn't much to do.\n\nSpending a few days with my partner doing nothing with no one else around sounds amazing.", "NTA.
