The mother says \"We all want to ride with Grandma\".   A few more seconds pass ( maybe 20 from start to finish) and grandma gets on the elevator.  \n\nShe looks at me (we are of the same ethnicity) and asks if I am part of some organization staying in the hotel.  I said I was not. Then the father says, \"He definitely isn't one of them, those people are nice...\".  I said \"I'm just in a hurry and a bit impatient.\"\n\nI certainly could have patiently waited for Grandma but it seems rude to jump onto my elevator and make me wait for Grandma to come out of her room.  & Then say I'm not nice!

They all left grandma by herself so that they could rush to push the elevator button. But then they wanted to make you wait for the person that they couldn't wait for in the first place before they pushed the button? \n\nIt sounds like they're the impatient ones that they couldn't wait for the next elevator or for their grandma to join them in the first place.", "If you go to a restaurant, most won't seat you until your entire party is present.\r  \n\r  \nElevator etiquette: If you have a party of 6, *why would you press the button before the full party is there?*\r  \n\r  \nThis probably won't be popular, but NTA.\r  \n\r  \nNow, this would be a different story if the elevator stopped on their floor by happenstance (for instance, somebody got off at 3).

A simple \u201csorry, grandma is a little slower but we\u2019re trying to all be on the same elevator\u201d would have been enough to not already have OP annoyed before an explanation was given.

I wouldn\u2019t be mad they pushed the button before everyone was there, they might have thought she\u2019d be out by the time it came. But they should have let you go and caught the next one. \n\nHowever, when these little inconveniences do happen I assume it\u2019s the universe slowing me down on purpose. How many times have we left 5 min late and there was an accident not long before we get to the same part of the road, I always think that\u2019s the universe protecting me from bad things. Maybe if this delay hadn\u2019t happened you wouldn\u2019t have looked both ways before crossing the street or it was just enough time for someone to put out a caution sign that the floor was wet and prevented you from slipping and hurting yourself.", "Dude it's 20 seconds.\n\nYTA", "I find it hilarious that you\u2019re flabbergasted they said you weren\u2019t nice.

Life doesn't operate on your timeline and this was hardly an inconvenience. \n\nI hope you can start to choose kindness in these moments, not just for strangers but for yourself. You deserve happiness. You deserve a life full of good things. You'll start to find those good things *if you look for them*. Spread kindness, be nice to strangers, compliment your cashier. Be a good person. Treat others with grace. \n\nLife doesn't have to be miserable all the time.", "Also this elevator is not your elevator. It is a public utility to be used by the public. You are a member of the public, so is this family and the grandma.\n\nYTA.", "In what world is 20 seconds a long time to wait? \nIn times short attention spans (courtesy of TikTok etc)?\nOr do you have patience of a 4 year old?\n\nCome on my dude, time to be a grown up.", "LMAO if you couldn\u2019t wait 20 seconds for an elderly lady then you should have simply gotten off and walked down the stairs it\u2019s really not a big deal. It\u2019s not hard to be patient and kind, especially when you\u2019re on vacation and can spare 20 seconds", "No it's not.  Are you capable of taking stairs?  If you are, do that next time.", "Otis? Is that you?", "I actually agree with you on the principle, but only if they made you wait for 1m+. 20 seconds is quick and it would be beneficial to practice some more patience on very minor inconveniences", "Exactly, plus after the family didn't follow this etiquette, one of the family members basically said she was rude for being frustrated with them.", "The reason why I posted this silly incident was because I'm having trouble getting over why me waiting for them is kindness but them making me wait, unnecessarily, is not unkind.  The elevators arrive literally every 10 seconds. Why can't they take them next one?", "It\u2019s such an unnecessary kindness though. Assuming they\u2019re both right (op and the original comment) the next elevator likely would have gotten there by the time the grandma did. It might not be long out of OPs time, but it\u2019s such an unnecessary thing for them to do. \n\nIt\u2019s also not like OP was extremely rude about it. He literally just told them the elevators were fast and then promptly waited. If anything the other guy was unnecessarily passive aggressive in his response about being kind.", "The thing is if they wanted to ride the elevator together why didn\u2019t they wait infront of the elevator on the whole party. They created an environment and called out people who they created the environment for.. \n\nAs a different example. I\u2019m spraying my front yard, and you cycle by, I see you yet I decide to spray in your direction to water the plant as I just to those exact plants\u2026 it doesn\u2019t make you less wet\u2026 I could waited to let you pass and water to the side for those 5/10 sec later. But I decide nah \u2026 and let you get wet. . Now I can reply to you should have swerved or hit the brakes\u2026 when you look at me like what the fudge\u2026 or I could\u2019ve said my bad\u2026. It\u2019s the principle that they created the space to call someone else impatient prick that makes them the assholes\u2026", "It isn\u2019t about the elevator. It\u2019s about the message you send.", "Then I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve done anything wrong", "I didn't say it was theirs either so your point doesn't make sense. However his argument was that they owed him a courtesy because it was \"his\" elevator. My argument is that they do not owe him said courtesy because it is not his elevator.", "Lord, I wish \u201c20 Mississippi\u2019s\u201d was the biggest inconvenience I faced. Take a deep breath, you\u2019ll be just fine lol", "I think you might be saying Mississippi a bit slowly if you think 20 seconds is a long time.", "Chill", "So now we pretend that I meant I own the elevator? LOL.  I meant it's one thing if they were holding the elevator and I walked into it, it's something different if I'm traveling and they impede my travel to hold the elevator.", "I cackled loudly at this. Take my poor man\u2019s gold \ud83e\udd47\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc5", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nTake this poor woman's gold, please.\n\ud83e\udd47\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udf96\ufe0f\ud83c\udfc6", "If the elevators arrive \"literally every 10 seconds\", you wouldn't be here complaining that you waited a whole twenty seconds for grandma to arrive. You sound extremely entitled.", "There is no such thing as unnecessary kindness.\n\nThe world needs more of it, not less.", "can you even read?? when on earth did he say his argument was that they \u201cowed\u201d him?? your just pulling shit out of your ass now", "No it's not. I know you don't mean that you own the elevator, but just because you got on the elevator before them does not mean they owe you any additional courtesy.", "You're on a vacation. You don't need to get from A to B in less than 60 seconds. The whole point of the vacation is to enjoy everything, including the process. You need to chill and breathe deep and enjoy yourself. You can't if you're high strung (you obviously are) and on edge. Go get a drink and take a good long soak. Get a massage. Enjoy the little stuff (yes even the inevitable pauses in life).", "The family could have been kind to OP and waited for the next elevator. The world needs more kindness after all."]}
