By your own admission it was 20 seconds. 20 seconds my dude.\n\nHonestly my first reaction is usually to get annoyed/angry at everything so I do get it. My brain tends to jump to negativity first even though when I reflect back it's absolutely not a situation worthy of those feelings. \n\nI can see internally kinda rolling your eyes but your life will probably be a bit more pleasant overall if you can learn how to take a breathe in the moment and reflect on whether it's really worth/why you're getting impatient/annoyed over something this insignificant.", "YTA \n\nThey weren\u2019t even holding the doors for a minute.

And they don\u2019t have to ask for 20 damn seconds if it had been minutes not seconds then things would be different but 20 seconds seriously.", "NTA. If they weren't ready they should have waited for the next one. They were rude and from your account, while you expressed some impatience, you didn't say anything rude or aggressive.", "NTA - So let me get this straight. They all left grandma by herself so that they could rush to push the elevator button. But then they wanted to make you wait for the person that they couldn't wait for in the first place before they pushed the button? \n\nIt sounds like they're the impatient ones that they couldn't wait for the next elevator or for their grandma to join them in the first place.", "If you go to a restaurant, most won't seat you until your entire party is present.\n\nElevator etiquette: If you have a party of 6, *why would you press the button before the full party is there?*\n\nThis probably won't be popular, but NTA.\n\nNow, this would be a different story if the elevator stopped on their floor by happenstance (for instance, somebody got off at 3).  Taking advantage of circumstances gets a larger allowance.  Holding the door for a reasonable time for someone you see is coming puts you on the correct side of elevator etiquette.\n\nETA:\n\nA lot of people are commenting, \"But it's just 20 seconds\".  My reply is that it's not about the time; it's about the entitlement.\r  \n\r  \nLet me explain without the etiquette but instead with an internal dialog.\r  \n\r  \nGuy thinks, \"I'll just push the button as soon as I get here.  If my whole party hasn't arrived, that's okay.  The people on the elevator car will just wait.  After all, my time is more important than the time of the common people.\"\r  \n\r  \nHe continues, \"If I waited 'til my party got here before pressing the button, then **I** would have to wait 20 seconds.

Elevator etiquette faux pas. \n\nThe family allowed the situation to be escalated because they didn\u2019t initiate communication. They just sat there in silence while their kid blocked the doorway despite someone else being in the elevator. A simple \u201csorry, grandma is a little slower but we\u2019re trying to all be on the same elevator\u201d would have been enough to not already have OP annoyed before an explanation was given. But they chose to wait and make OP wonder if the kid was just an AH kid or if something was happening. So by the time they did give an explanation, it was annoying. \n\nThe wait in elevators feels like forever when you\u2019re crowded with people so I get it. But also OP, like someone mentioned earlier, it\u2019s time to learn to develop more patience.", "NTA - I completely understand your annoyance with the situation. I wouldn\u2019t be mad they pushed the button before everyone was there, they might have thought she\u2019d be out by the time it came. But they should have let you go and caught the next one. \n\nHowever, when these little inconveniences do happen I assume it\u2019s the universe slowing me down on purpose. How many times have we left 5 min late and there was an accident not long before we get to the same part of the road, I always think that\u2019s the universe protecting me from bad things. Maybe if this delay hadn\u2019t happened you wouldn\u2019t have looked both ways before crossing the street or it was just enough time for someone to put out a caution sign that the floor was wet and prevented you from slipping and hurting yourself.", "Dude it's 20 seconds.\n\nYTA", "I find it hilarious that you\u2019re flabbergasted they said you weren\u2019t nice. No, you weren\u2019t nice. You made a mountain out of a molehill. I understand being annoyed your elevator is waiting, but to get so bent out of shape for waiting for an old lady?

You see them approaching the cash register in the grocery store, but you can move faster, so you make it a point to cut in front of them in line because you can.

Is that you?", "I actually agree with you on the principle, but only if they made you wait for 1m+. 20 seconds is quick and it would be beneficial to practice some more patience on very minor inconveniences", "Exactly, plus after the family didn't follow this etiquette, one of the family members basically said she was rude for being frustrated with them.", "The reason why I posted this silly incident was because I'm having trouble getting over why me waiting for them is kindness but them making me wait, unnecessarily, is not unkind.

It\u2019s not about OP being sooo important that he needs to be somewhere 20 seconds sooner, it\u2019s that it is always rude to take time from other people against their will when it\u2019s unnecessary. \n\nThe family knew grandma was slow and they were willing to wait, so they should\u2019ve waited outside the elevator until she could join them, and then pressed the button. They don\u2019t know OP and OP doesn\u2019t them, so there\u2019s absolutely no need for OP to stand there and wait for grandma with them. Also they\u2019re not only slowing down the people on the elevator, but they\u2019re also preventing every other person in the building from using that elevator for it\u2019s intended purpose. Now is it a life or death situation? No. Are they terrible people? No. But the principle applies regardless.\n\nI also don\u2019t consider OP impatient for not wanting to wait in this situation. Impatience is when you\u2019re not willing to wait when there\u2019s an actual reason, not just because other people are being inconsiderate. For example, it\u2019s impatient to start honking because traffic is moving slowly. It\u2019s not impatient to honk because someone is sitting at a green light fucking around on their phone. There\u2019s traffic because it\u2019s busy and there\u2019s nothing you can do. The person on their phone is holding everyone else up because they\u2019re inconsiderate.

My apartment has a single elevator. Often, someone on a mid level floor will press the button and hold the elevator until her roommate comes. It usually is 5+ minutes. \n\nThe first time, I had groceries and didn't know what was happening at level 1. A line formed when it arrived so that not everyone could fit. I had a box rip in my hands due to waiting that long. Huge mess and issue. After that, I adopted a no hold policy. I, and most residents immediately go to security when the elevator is on that floor so they can climb up the stairs and fix the issue. \n\nIf someone is actively coming and I see them, I will hold the elevator, and I will wait. But if my eyes are not on you, you can wait for the elevator to come like I can. \n\nSince I am not an AH, I had that policy my entire life. If I was near an elevator, and my party didn't arrive and I didn't see them when the doors opened and others were inside, I apologize and say I am waiting for someone and to go ahead. After my held elevator issues, I dont press the button until everyone arrives.", "ESH. Kinda. Because the way I understand it, you couldn't see grandma at first.

The dad then shaded you hard.", "Elevators are shared accommodations meant to assist people to go up and down in a building rather than walking the stairs.  Grandma needs assistance.  Many older people can only stand for short periods of time.  She may only be able to stand for a minute or so meaning that she may not be able to stand and wait for an elevator - hence the need to hold it while she walks the 20 seconds to get in, then rides down and can walk to a seat. \nGrandma and company are doing their best.\nYou are not. \nYTA", "Neither, they shouldn\u2019t hold others up, it\u2019s a little entitled, but also 20 seconds isn\u2019t much unless you had some kind of emergency,", "Info needed - did you need to be anywhere urgently, like at a specific time and they were making you late?", "NTA\u2014- I absolutely HATE when people do not value your time, and they keep you waiting.
