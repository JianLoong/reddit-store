She loves water and has been talking about it for months, so I was a bit thrown off when she came home crying a few days ago and told me she didn\u2019t want to go. I asked her why and she wouldn't tell me because she thought I\u2019d think she\u2019s a \u201cbad person.\u201d When I finally coaxed it out of her, she said her teacher \u201cMs. N\u201d has forced her to be the \u201cbuddy\u201d of her classmate \u201cBen\u201d for the entirety of the trip. She was to ride the bus with Ben to and from the trip, eat lunch with him, and go on all the rides with him instead of spending time with her friends. She then said nobody likes Ben because he whines whenever they have to do work and picks his nose and wipes boogers everywhere.\n\nI was horrified, not only because Ms. N had made Bryn do such a thing, but also because she had made her believe she was a bad person for not wanting to. Unfortunately this wasn\u2019t my first experience with Ms. N, as she frequently used my soft-spoken, intelligent older daughter as a \u201cbehavior buffer\u201d for the naughty boys until I threatened to report her to the superintendent. It\u2019s clear to me that Ms. N is still too comfortable with enforcing archaic gender roles on her kids and forcing girls to do unpaid emotional labor for the sake of the boys.\u00a0\n\nI immediately sent Ms. N an email condemning her actions. She sent me back an email with a bunch of bs that basically ended with \u201cif Bryn goes on the trip, she has to be Ben\u2019s buddy.\u201d *Fine.* I informed her Bryn would not be attending then. I immediately booked VIP tickets the same day her class was going so she could still go to the park and see her friends.\n\nWhat happened next I wasn\u2019t expecting. Bryn is quite popular, so I have gotten to know a lot of the moms in her class. When I let them know what Ms. N did, some of them were so horrified that they also pulled their kids out of the trip. In total, eight kids (out of a class of twenty) are either not going, or going with us. Today I got an email from Ms. N saying that because almost half of the class isn\u2019t going, they either have to raise the cost for the other students or not go at all. She practically begged me to let Bryn go and tell all the other parents to let their kids go, promising she wouldn\u2019t make Bryn do anything she didn\u2019t want to do. I told her she should have thought about that before she tried to make my daughter do *her* job.\u00a0\n\nMy husband said I was being a bit petty and that Ms. N clearly feels bad about what she did, and I should let Bryn go as I\u2019ve already gotten my way. He asked me if I really wanted to deprive children of what they\u2019ve been waiting for all year. The thing is, if this wasn\u2019t Ms. N\u2019s first offense I probably would have agreed, but she has a pattern of this type of behavior and hopefully this will put a stop to it. Plus, if she has to explain this to her superiors, I have receipts. Is my husband right?

In fact in light of your update I would make an appointment with the principal and teacher to discuss this matter further.  Your child was the only child enforced with special conditions on attendance on this trip, that did nothing for her benefit but make her an unpaid companion.   You already tried to speak to the teacher who clearly told you the parameters wouldn\u2019t change regardless of your chosen actions.  Again ignoring the mental state of your child needs for the sole benefit of another child. \n\nOther parents were horrified for just cause, while not being aggressive they instead chose not to send their own children while not agreeing with the teachers rigid constraints imposed on the excursion.   The follow on effect now has created further issues the teacher cannot solve on her own.  This highlights a much more serious issue within her teaching techniques and will involve the principal regardless, when other unhappy parents start contacting the school over the raised fees or increased cost to now attend the trip.   All which could have been easily avoided by the teacher upon the first contact made by a parent concerned over the wellbeing of her child, by her inflexible nature.   So to infer the fallout consequences are all down to you is extremely poor form still coming from the teacher.  This is the point that needs further discussion with the principal and a pathway made forward to stop using your child as a tool in regards to a socially inept child in the classroom.   Until the teacher stops using your child as a tool to use in the classroom or on excursions, this issue will only repeat itself.", "[deleted]", "NTA. She isn't sorry she did this.

Eight was a stretch.\n\nWe never went to a water park, but as a teacher I'd want a higher ratio of adults to children than that.  For pool parties we had an adult for every 2-3 kids.  Better to be cautious.....\n\nIn any event the teacher is lazy and mean.  She is the kind of teacher who gives others a bad name, besides annoying her colleagues.  \n\nShe needs to be giving extra help and attention to poor Ben, who sounds like he does not have an orderly family life, and is probably behind academically.\n\nNTA, OP.  Keep sticking up for your kids.", "There's been absolutely no indication he's done anything wrong, mean, or dangerous. She literally doesn't like him because he whines and has boogers. Guess what? So does every other 9-year-old. Booking your daughter VIP tickets the exact same day just reeks of entitlement.", "See I think it sounds like she did encourage the other moms to", "IDK, it *is* convenient, BUT...\n\nMy child was at one point the Ben of the story. There was a girl in 3rd grade who was really good at handling my child's sensory issues, because of experience with a cousin. She was \"assigned\" to be my child's partner during every field trip and group project all year, even when partners weren't assigned.\n\nIt was fine that year, because they got along and both enjoyed it, but the next year, the new teacher tried to continue this practice, and it wasn't fun for her anymore. Myself AND her mother both had to protest to the AP at the same time, because when just her mother said something they ignored it.\n\nIt wasn't fair to her kid, obviously, but it wasn't fair to my kid either. Forcing one child to look after another puts the other into a position of being a burden, disliked, and sometimes bullied.\n\nAnyway... might be the same kind of thing with this OP, might not, but either way the teacher is out of line... if a child is that uncomfortable with a buddy, you make changes to the roster, you don't double down.", "It may be that the other students were allowed to pick their own buddy, which is not uncommon.  Op's edit not entirely clear to me", "Ok why was the teacher singling out op daughter I would go to the school board", "We can all feel sorry for Ben\u2014it sounds like the poor kid needs a friend. That doesn\u2019t mean OPs daughter has to be responsible for his happiness. There are other ways to integrate a student into a classroom.", "No, but forcing a girl to spend time with him when she doesn\u2019t want to doesn\u2019t solve anything. It\u2019ll just make her (and probably her friends) dislike him more. \n\nA better solution would be to help him make friends (talk to him about good hygiene practices such as that wiping boogers everywhere isn\u2019t ok, play games or do group tasks with the entire class that help the kids get to know each other, etc.).", "There\u2019s an edit. Yes, she was.", "Any time a teacher or parent tries to force a friendship,  they automatically become the AH. The teacher was trying to make it easier on herself-- not either student.", "I think OP made the right call because Ms.N could have easily lied and still had OP's daughter watch Ben. This way there is no chance the daughter would have a crappy trip. The kids are being punished because of Ms.N, not OP.", "I feel bad for the kid who needs to supervise the boy. She\u2019s 9.

If he\u2019s that difficult, his parents should come as his chaperone", "what reason does she have to let her kid go on the trip except to let that teacher get away with her bs?", "lmaoooo did u read it? they didnt let her daughter be stuck w a booger eating child so they pulled their kid from the trip and got her friends to do the same to go on their own", "OP did not ruin it for the other kids, Ms. N did.  Or maybe poorly behaving boy(s).  But not OP", "Ms. N is the one who forced a \"rule\" on Bryn that she didn't impose on any other student in the class, not OP. OP stood up for her daughter. The teacher is at fault here.", "OP did NOT ruin anything, she was protecting her daughter. Imagine if you were not allowed to play with your friends, but had to babysit another kid in the class, and get snot rubbed on you and the area around you? If you were not allowed to play with your friends, and had to just sit and deal with a kid that was NOT ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS all day? \n\nWe had a kid like that in my class, nobody was forced to baby sit him, and he ended up being put in a special ed class to help him learn better social behaviors and learn with a class more his speed. \n\nIf the teacher cannot cope with him, she should not be forcing a CHILD to.", "She's not ruining it for other kids.\nThe teacher ruined for the other kids.\n\nRepeat after me. This is the *teacher's* fault. If parents want someone to blame blame the teacher for being ah", "OP updated that her daughter was *the only* one assigned a buddy.  No one else in the class had an assigned buddy and were free to hang out with whomever they wanted.", "dude wipes his boogers on shit even at 9 u should know thats gross", "Seconded.", "The teacher has been spoken to about this many times, YET IT STILL CONTINUES. This is not a first time incident that was resolved peacefully. \n\nThe teacher only complained when a large number of students dropped out and their parents decided to take them, themselves. Teacher was fine with all of this, until the consequences affected HER. \n\nI know people like this. Until someone in authority deals with it, she will be sneaky and try to minimize her treatment of OP's child.\n\nWant to bet, ten minutes after they hit the park, teacher would be \"just let him ride with you this 3rd time, you can talk to your friends on lunch break! Stop being selfish, your friends were seated right on the seat in front of you on the bus! you couldn't SEE them, but you could still TALK to them!

There were a lot of ways to handle this so Ben had people to play with and Bryn could still be with her friends, but the teacher wouldn't budge. Then to find out her daughter is the only one who has to have a partner? And she was also told she was a bad person if she didn't partner with him? Sorry. This is all on the teacher. And the only reason Ms. N is backing down at all is because she knows it will come back on her if that trip is canceled.", "Only OP's daughter was assigned a \"buddy,\" the rest were not.", "The daughter is the only child who was assigned a \u2018buddy\u2019.

No one else had to, I was just almost always done early and the teacher made me do it instead of having free time. So while I'm inclined to agree with you, because this sub is filled with too good to be true stories and that detail is oddly convenient, I could also absolutely see a misguided teacher think she's helping by assigning a popular kid to spend time with an unpopular kid (and it sure sounds like Ben is). \n\nA lot of adults seem to treat kids as if they have zero recollection of what being a kid was actually like. I could absolutely see an adult thinking this would somehow make Ben more popular.", "A teacher pulled the same thing on my daughter in elementary school. She had a calming influence on a boisterous boy (they were playmates and he was otherwise a decent kid), so she was paired with him frequently. I spoke with her teacher and she immediately switched my daughter to a different table and going forward ensured all the kids rotated partners on school trips and events.\n\nNow Mom buying VIP tickets...that seems a bit 'Karenish' and far-fetched. But I'll assume that's what truly happened. What OP should/could have done:\n\n- insisted that her daughter attend without 'buddy' duty. It's NOT the job of a child to monitor classmate behavior. \n- brought this to the attention of the principal if the teacher still insisted on the 'buddy' system.\n- volunteer as a parent helper during the trip.\n- volunteer for a day in her daughter's classroom. See what's really going on.\n\n OP, what do you think will happen if your daughter's classmates see her skipping to the head of the line on the VIP pass? They will be jealous and resentful. These are KIDS. Your issue is with the teacher - WHY are you bringing kids into it?", "Normally I wouldn\u2019t believe this but I would totally do this if it were my kid. When my son was in grade 2 or 3 he was being bullied by another boy. I went and talked to the teacher a number of times. My son comes home from school and tells me he has been partnered with his bully for the school feild trip the next day. Guess who did not go on that feild trip. My son and I had a mother son day and the following day I went up to the school and had a very stern talk with the principal.", "How is it entitled? Her daughter was the only one who had to have a buddy. No one else. Simply because the teacher knew that the kids did not like that child. And ON TOP of that she doubles down and says \u201cwell she *has* to be his buddy because I said so.\u201d And only relented when it was causing her direct problems. I see no entitlement.", "But why does he get a buddy specially assigned to him?

But the other students did nothing, and the teacher at this point backed down, said she didn't have to do anything she didn't want to do. The mother already won. Punishment should happen to the teacher, not to the other kids. Honestly, the mom shutting down the trip likely will get out and could result in her child being bullied. I agree something should be done, but cancelling the trip shouldn't be, neither should raises the prices as some parents may not be able to afford it. The best outcome is the teacher is forced to pay the extra money for causing this mess.", "That is true UNTIL the teacher backed down. I agree she did the right thing initially. But not sending her now is punishing the kids, not the teacher. The fair thing would be for the teacher to pay the difference in cost but I am fairly sure they would just cancel the trip instead.", "We had buddies on every field trip at school and I still use that system as a teacher, it's not 'owed' gender based labour, it's called socialising kids.

Its not the truth. Change the story enough so everyone on reddit thinks im a hero. It's BS", "I seriously doubt the teacher said Bryn wasn't allowed to see her friends at all on this trip, and had to exclusively play with Ben and *only* Ben. Does that sound realistic to you? It certainly doesn't sound realistic or believable to me, and I think OP is giving us a *very* dramatized version of events. \n\nSince she is really popular, I'll bet the teacher just wanted Ben to be able to join the group that Bryn is a part of. I can't blame the teacher for trying to help the awkward, lonely kid in class find some friends.", "I have a hard time believing that. I have a hard time accepting that the school is allowing a bunch of 9-year-olds to do whatever they want with no buddy system. South Park has an entire episode about accountabilibuddies because that cliche is so accurate and something everybody who's ever been on a field trip has experienced. I especially think that they would have some sort of requirement that students stay in groups when you have young girls at a water park of all places.", "Where I grew up, it was common for public schools to have unnecessary school trips for leisure like a waterpark. If you couldn't afford it you could have the cost subsidized too", "I was what you would consider a social outcast. My mom was a crack head and I honestly didn\u2019t know how to behave. I only learned through tough situations like realizing my behavior didn\u2019t help me. \nIf they wanted to help the kid make a friend, it would have been worded that way. Instead they paired him with a well behaved girl. Girls are often forced to be caregivers.", "You\u2019re right, but forcing another kid to spend time with him won\u2019t help. It\u2019ll probably just make her and her friends dislike him even more.", "screw those kids lmaoooo none of them cared her daughters trip was ruined if they want to enjoy the water park those 8 kids should ask their parents to get them tickets to go just like this kid had to do", "yea but in this case the school is gonna look i to why 1 class didnt go on a field trip and hopefully fix the issue a school will only make a problem as big as u do so if they want this to stop they have to make it a big deal", "OP said Ms. N did the same thing to her older daughter with a group of misbehaving boys.

This is not on OP or her kid", "Sure she backed down because she was finally busted. \n\nIf OP backed down, there is no way this teacher is not going to make op's daughter pay in some form.

You gave her the chance to change it, and she didn't change it until it had an impact on her. She only cares about how bad she's going to look, having only having half the class go on a trip that should be fun for everyone and that everyone should want to go to! She also will probably have to explain why only half the kids are going when it's a water park! Explaining the situation will make her look bad, and she's only worried about that. Seeing as she's making repeat offenses of mistreating the children and ruining their fun, particularly your daughter's, I wouldn't trust her to lie about the reason half the kids aren't going and believe whatever lie she says just because she's a teacher. For this reason, I'd just tell the people about her everything that she's done. Your daughter isn't going to be the only one she does this to. So, while the other kids might miss out, I consider this to be far from petty. By not going and putting her in the hot seat, she's more likely to get called on the nonsense she's pulling. That means she'll be watched better or something else that hopefully keeps other kids from getting bullied by her. If you let it go, then she won't change. Just continue to bully her other students in the future. \n\n\nI could get if it was a buddy system thing and purely for safety. But they should get to choose their buddy and it should be a fun time. Not a forced thing that ruins your fun and reputation (and I know it's not his fault if he's deemed the \"weird\" kid because kids are super mean. But all the same, generally, people who hang out with the \"weird\" kid then become \"weird\" kids themselves. It's totally unfair, but she shouldn't put kids in that position) They're also 8 year olds who are almost 9, 9 year olds, and 10 year olds, I'd guess. The buddy should ultimately be a teacher since they simply won't break off into groups where they could get lost if their teachers are doing their jobs properly. Your husband is wrong about her feeling bad. If she did, she'd have seen your daughter was unhappy and made changes since it's supposed to be a fun event. You've also already paid your VIP tickets, and you probably bought yourself and / or your husband a ticket for the day. So, to have her go on the field trip now would mean you pay more.

(I was a room mom and help in these situations many times.) \n- buddy groups of 3 or 4 as someone else suggested (usually with a parent chaperone for each group)\n\n\nMy only other concern for OP is that Bryn\u2019s absence on the trip may be considered an unexcused absence with district/state. In most US school districts the rules on absences are unbending. Perhaps consider calling your kiddo in \u201csick\u201d and staying home that day and changing your ticket date with friends to another day. Then, I would definitely report this incident to the principal.", "Ditto. I was often put in groups with the \"bad kids\" on  group projects because the teacher's knew I was the only one who could handle it and would put up with their bullshit, right up through high school. One teacher even told me, about a student I constantly got paired with who I'd been in school with from a kindergarten through high school, \"You're the only person I know who can get John to do the work.\" John being the super popular class clown jag off kid who today would be diagnosed with ADHD in a fucking heartbeat.\n\nIn addition, my mom worked at the school in the special education department, with kids that had conditions like learning disabilities and Downs syndrome. In gym class, I was often paired to work with those girls because no one else wanted to work with them. The teacher knew who my mom was and knew that I would be understanding. But it was immensely difficult for someone who is 14 or 15 to be working with students like that and trying to get them to do physical education activities. I wasn't a teacher and it was very trying sometimes. However, a lot of the other students were incredibly cruel to these girls and at least I got to be a safe place for them sometimes. \n\nNTA, OP. Your daughter isn't responsible for being a teacher or a caregiver for other students. And she shouldn't feel bad because she doesn't want to. At the same time, as she ages it's important to make sure she understands to treat students who are different or have different abilities in school with care and compassion. Not saying that didn't happen here, but it could be an important additional lesson down the line.", "Same. We had to play with one kid who would slam toy trains and trucks into our heads and punch holes in the wall and punch us too. In hindsight, I think he was undiagnosed and having a meltdown.

Our dressing room got moved around and she left something behind.  When I went to the teacher to ask permission to go retrieve it, I ended up pushed against the wall and screamed at.  This was in the 70s.   I still remember it.  The abuse aside, as a 9 year old I should never  have been made responsible for a 6 year old.", "I feel exactly the same! She doesn't feel bad for her actions. The proof is in the fact that this was brought to the teacher's attention that her daughter was upset and that she was upset, yet the teacher stuck by it. That is ONLY until it effected HER! She didn't care that the girl was upset and is just being a bully because she can. Totally agree, NTA, and I hope that OP sticks to her guns on this one and decides to keep the VIP tickets and use those. I get half the kids might not get to go now, but that's definitely the teacher's fault rather than OP's because if the teacher had decided to change her mind sooner, none of this would have happened. It just prevents her from bullying her daughter in the future since it has consequences and prevents her from bullying other students in the future if her superiors get involved. That said, I think she would lie about why it happened and I personally would go to them and tell them why only half the class is going as well as everything else the teacher has done. That way they know this isn't an isolated incident and so she can't lie about the reason why. Because if she lies, in my experience, they believe the teacher.

It\u2019s also odd that they\u2019re not doing buddies of the same gender.

She'd also have Ben's parents complaining that he wasn't given the long leash the rest of the kids got (plus she'd have to deal with whatever other behavior problems cropped up). I will say it would have been better to buddy Ben up with a male student, although it's entirely possible that there wasn't one she trusted.

Every student in this class is in a class of 20 students, and that's what this thread was about.

It feels to me like she didn't want to have to tell parents about having to pay extra, because she'd have to explain why.\n\nIt's also certainly not entitled to refuse to put your child in a situation where they have to babysit a problem child instead of enjoying the field trip. \n\nRegardless, I do appreciate where you're coming from, and the points you've raised.

So me and my buddy who were both competitive got our parents to call out for us, and then each time our school went skiing, one of our parents drove us to the mountain. Our teachers were pissed that our parents \"enabled\" this work around but we got a full day of free skiing while our classmates did their lessons.

Cry me a river, things like these are the reason no sane person wants to teach anymore.", "YTA, I think your actions are fine if you had tried to go to the Admins with your issues to override the teacher, because it is unfair to assign a buddy to one and not all. Also I think what really makes you the AH is you tell all the other parents and ruin the whole field trip.\n\nHowever you don\u2019t mention attempting going to admins and instead you are ruining the trip for a bunch of kids.", "U are pulling out gender stuff that teacher proly hasn't even considered. I feel bad for the boy! Maybe she felt your daughter wouldn't let him be excluded. Yes she should of assigned every one a buddy but that's not the senerio. If my kid was fine seeing another kid being excluded I'd be disappointed in them any all the other kids too.. that boy damn sure deserves the trip more than they do!", "INFO : is Ben being bullied in any way ? Because that would change a lot of things", "I was used that way to and sat next to misbehaving kids in the hope that my quietness would make them quiet too (I was a severely depressed and anxious child but no one noticed because I didn\u2019t act out.)\n\nWhen I was 9 my teacher would literally come up to a student desk and yell at them when they were misbehaving or if they had bad grades or forgotten something, so she used to come up to our desk a lot and yell at the little boy sat next to me.\n\nLet me tell you, while you might not be the target, it doesn\u2019t differ much from being yelled at yourself and it made me *hate* school.", "I was used that way too. It sucks!", "This happened to me so much as a child AND an adult that I 100% believe it. Compare it to a workplace where good workers get given more projects for the same pay but shittier workers just keep their standard work load.", "That's one of the main areas that shows this is total bullshit. Staffing ratios are way off.", "I've had the same thoughts about whose job it is.  One example was in a sport, where they changed the age groupings, and my son got left behind when his friends and players of equal ability got put up.  A policy was made that if a younger play could demonstrate a certain skill, they could go up too.  My son demonstrated that skill, and one ref said he could go up, but another ref changed the rules on him and said he couldn't.  We were told that my son needed to stay down because he was such a great role model for the younger kids.\n\nMy kid was not there to be a role model.  It's a great bonus if he is, but he is there primarily to play and learn himself.  Note that he was nine at the time.  It was not his job to stay in a lower age group to be a role model, when he had demonstrated the ability to cope in the higher level.", "They're basically creating trauma for your kid because they're too lazy to do their jobs", "And complain official about the teacher to the board. Nta", "My school made an 'experimental' class that did this by taking the highest performing students and lowest performing and putting them all in the same form/class.\n\nThey all ended up getting along, but in a way that effectively 'corrupted' the smart kids. A year later we had a bunch more bullies that would harass you *and* were legitimately far smarter than you and all your friends.", "See, I think we would have kinda loved the secretary part, because that would have made us feel important and grown up. The babysitting part on the other hand, \ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e", "Kids won't adhere to reason or logic. At 9 years old most children are still learning those social subtleties. If it comes out, that \"Bryn's mom started this\" then Bryn will be punished by her classmates.", "I was one of these kids. It super sucked to be stuck doing 2x the work while the other kid did nothing.", "That was such bullshit. \u201cDave and Robbie didn\u2019t finish the assignment so you all have to put your heads down for 15 minutes!\u201d Guess what, a couple years later I saw Robbie\u2019s house which was literally a tar paper shack (in the 1970s). I\u2019m guessing he had bigger things to worry about.", "Your play date comment reminded me of the time the teacher, waaay into the school year, decided that we should hang out with different students in our freetime, so that the ones who didn't have as many friends, or had trouble making any at all, could find some friends, and also so that the whole class could all be friends with eachother. \n\nThe teacher actually fully demanded that our parents host \"our new group\" one night of the week, taking turn in which member's house they were at, so every 3/4 week the parents would have to put their night and money aside to throw this forced get together. Giving 0 fucks about someone's space and the size of it, their living situation or economy/level of income. There were twins in my class that got asigned to different groups, so not only did their family have to deal with a group twice as large, \n the teacher wouldn't allow them to do \"their week\" together, so those poor parents had to plan and host this twice every month for their kid's different groups! Not sure what one twin did when it was the other ones turn to have the group over, seeing how you were suppose to be with the group for that night instead of your useal friends. Probably hanging with the people they actually wanted to be around. I would say that it shockingly didn't last long when the teacher realiced it made no freaking difference regarding who we hang out with any other day, but the more shocking thing is that it actually got off the ground. \n\nAnyway, seeing how friendship groups had already been formed long ago, it just resulted in most of them getting split up, while a few lucky ones got paired together. Me? I was split from my friend group and put in a group that consisted of members that were already friends. Now being forced to go and spend 1 night a week hanging out with them outside of school. Oh but the kicker? The teacher had put me in the one friendgroup that got a kick out of regularly bullying me. They didn't try anything in front of their/my parents, but it didn't make it any more fun.", "I\u2019m so sorry you went through that. You deserve(d) better, as did your brother.", "This one! That's what the school did with me when I was 10. It was called Friendship Group Therapy (and in my case also kind of anger management). Just four to five kids hanging out once a week with the guidance counselor, learning how to make friends and deal with our emotions.", "Damn, as someone who was excruciatingly shy and anxious as a child, I hated teachers like you're describing with a passion. \n\nNothing more crushing than being forced to not partner with your trusted friends and instead work with someone causing you to spill your spaghetti. Confidence killer right there.", "As a behaviour buffer student myself this type of behaviour from teachers suck. I always got paired with badly behaved boys. The seating plan would change and I\u2019d always be next to a loud boy who never did their work as I was a \u201cgood influence\u201d. It completely ruined the classes for me as I felt isolated doing my work, not wanting to be teased by the kids who didn\u2019t work and not having anyone to have class discussions with. OP did the right thing and I wish I whistleblew when this happened to me at that age!", "Yes thanks for this, it is important to remember that a \u2018win\u2019 over an adult with authority over your child can lead to retaliation. \n\nMy 5th grade teacher had an altercation with my mother over something stupid she did that caused me to hurt myself. She then tortured me for the rest of that year, making me the scapegoat for everything that went wrong and leaving me open to bullying from my classmates. \n\nLuckily me and my mum have always been very close so my mum spent a lot of time at the school, talking to higher-ups and confronting the teacher in person until she reversed whatever stupid evil decision she\u2019d recently made (moving me away from my friends and making me sit alone, forcing me to sit alone at lunch and clear my plate even if I was retching, rewarding my bullies and punishing me for their behaviour etc etc).\n\nWe got through the year but it was tough as hell. \n\nOP, I would make it very very clear to this teacher that you will be keeping tabs on your daughter\u2019s classroom experiences going forward and keeping receipts. \n\nNTA, obviously", ">She needs to feel the full weight of the consequences of her choices \n\nExactly!  So many people ***do*** need this in today's society.", "Adults are just so fucking clueless sometimes. I'm sorry you had to deal with that.", "Ok but high/low performing academically is a far different thing than poorly/well behaved. As long as it\u2019s not used as a crutch I can see sometimes pairing students who need a little help with the material with another student who gets it and can maybe explain in a way the struggling student can understand. The high performer benefits from this arrangement as well because explaining concepts helps cement what you\u2019ve learned. \n\nIf they encourage teachers to pair \u201ctroublemaker\u201d kids with \u201cgood\u201d kids though, that\u2019s not cool.", "Sometimes. Sometimes the parents are happy to get help for their kid. A lot depends on the local culture. In my community we\u2019re big on getting kids all the services we can, because it gives even typical kids a boost and we know it helps.", "Can confirm. Partner and I both got the whole \"you aren't a nice person if you don't take on the emotional labour of your classmates\" soeech from our teachers. All it did was teach us consent issues, which is not what you want especially as a 9 year old girl!", "100% agree with this recommendation. She\u2019ll be getting some uncomfortable questions from her superiors anyway if the cost for the remaining students goes up, and she might just try and throw OP under the bus then. \n\nHonestly, imo, this kind of behaviour (especially since it\u2019s pattern behaviour) should be reported anyway.", "Thank you. I appriciate it. Yeah, it amazes me that it actually went from the drawing table into becoming an actual thing. When students can find multiple things wrong with a plan, those issues/conserns should be obvious red flags for all the grown ups that was involved in the making of this project.", "I hope you taught them the wrong information and they got bad grades. Hahaha.\n\nJust kidding.\n\n^sort ^of.", "Yep. I was this kid too.  The one time I said that I rather not do something if that was ok, I was told I was unhelpful and unkind and they were docking points from my school prize total.  I was PUNISHED for not doing something that no one else had to do or volunteer for.", "100% this was my experience as well. Being expected to just be the punching bag of all the troublemakers in the class in order to make the teachers job easier. But if I ever complained about the double standard and unfair treatment I was the asshole according to the teachers.", "Same. The sad thing that never seems to be considered (or if it is considered, dismissed as unimportant) is that teaching a child that they have to do whatever it is that will make their peers happy rather than what will make the child happy teaches a child that they have to put everyone else\u2019s needs above their own. It takes away some of their freedom, and the opportunity to learn about what they like or dislike and ask for what they want. Those children often grow up into adults doing the same thing - doing whatever anyone else decides is more important than their own needs, fearing that they are a bad person if ever they want to place boundaries or put themselves first before others. They are not the parents of their classmates nor are they teachers. Let the children be children.", "Those in Blind CC won\u2019t get the teachers replies.\n\nYou can keep them all out and then just add them to the email chain.", "Sounds to me like the teacher has been grooming Bryn to get her to do this for a long time now. Slowly installing these terrible ideas that to be a \"good girl\" in her teacher's eyes, she has to do things she doesn't want to, allowing her to stay in the good graces and likeability of the teacher. For young people, especially in the formative years like OP's daughter's age, this is truly sadistic of the teacher."]}
