She loves water and has been talking about it for months, so I was a bit thrown off when she came home crying a few days ago and told me she didn\u2019t want to go. I asked her why and she wouldn't tell me because she thought I\u2019d think she\u2019s a \u201cbad person.\u201d When I finally coaxed it out of her, she said her teacher \u201cMs. N\u201d has forced her to be the \u201cbuddy\u201d of her classmate \u201cBen\u201d for the entirety of the trip. She was to ride the bus with Ben to and from the trip, eat lunch with him, and go on all the rides with him instead of spending time with her friends. She then said nobody likes Ben because he whines whenever they have to do work and picks his nose and wipes boogers everywhere.\n\nI was horrified, not only because Ms. N had made Bryn do such a thing, but also because she had made her believe she was a bad person for not wanting to. Unfortunately this wasn\u2019t my first experience with Ms. N, as she frequently used my soft-spoken, intelligent older daughter as a \u201cbehavior buffer\u201d for the naughty boys until I threatened to report her to the superintendent. It\u2019s clear to me that Ms. N is still too comfortable with enforcing archaic gender roles on her kids and forcing girls to do unpaid emotional labor for the sake of the boys.\u00a0\n\nI immediately sent Ms. N an email condemning her actions. She sent me back an email with a bunch of bs that basically ended with \u201cif Bryn goes on the trip, she has to be Ben\u2019s buddy.\u201d *Fine.* I informed her Bryn would not be attending then. I immediately booked VIP tickets the same day her class was going so she could still go to the park and see her friends.\n\nWhat happened next I wasn\u2019t expecting. Bryn is quite popular, so I have gotten to know a lot of the moms in her class. When I let them know what Ms. N did, some of them were so horrified that they also pulled their kids out of the trip. In total, eight kids (out of a class of twenty) are either not going, or going with us. Today I got an email from Ms. N saying that because almost half of the class isn\u2019t going, they either have to raise the cost for the other students or not go at all. She practically begged me to let Bryn go and tell all the other parents to let their kids go, promising she wouldn\u2019t make Bryn do anything she didn\u2019t want to do. I told her she should have thought about that before she tried to make my daughter do *her* job.\u00a0\n\nMy husband said I was being a bit petty and that Ms. N clearly feels bad about what she did, and I should let Bryn go as I\u2019ve already gotten my way. He asked me if I really wanted to deprive children of what they\u2019ve been waiting for all year. The thing is, if this wasn\u2019t Ms. N\u2019s first offense I probably would have agreed, but she has a pattern of this type of behavior and hopefully this will put a stop to it. Plus, if she has to explain this to her superiors, I have receipts. Is my husband right?

In fact in light of your update I would make an appointment with the principal and teacher to discuss this matter further.  Your child was the only child enforced with special conditions on attendance on this trip, that did nothing for her benefit but make her an unpaid companion.   You already tried to speak to the teacher who clearly told you the parameters wouldn\u2019t change regardless of your chosen actions.  Again ignoring the mental state of your child needs for the sole benefit of another child. \n\nOther parents were horrified for just cause, while not being aggressive they instead chose not to send their own children while not agreeing with the teachers rigid constraints imposed on the excursion.   The follow on effect now has created further issues the teacher cannot solve on her own.  This highlights a much more serious issue within her teaching techniques and will involve the principal regardless, when other unhappy parents start contacting the school over the raised fees or increased cost to now attend the trip.   All which could have been easily avoided by the teacher upon the first contact made by a parent concerned over the wellbeing of her child, by her inflexible nature.   So to infer the fallout consequences are all down to you is extremely poor form still coming from the teacher.  This is the point that needs further discussion with the principal and a pathway made forward to stop using your child as a tool in regards to a socially inept child in the classroom.   Until the teacher stops using your child as a tool to use in the classroom or on excursions, this issue will only repeat itself.", "Am I the only one feeling sorry for Ben?", "NTA.

Eight was a stretch.\n\nWe never went to a water park, but as a teacher I'd want a higher ratio of adults to children than that.  For pool parties we had an adult for every 2-3 kids.  Better to be cautious.....\n\nIn any event the teacher is lazy and mean.  She is the kind of teacher who gives others a bad name, besides annoying her colleagues.  \n\nShe needs to be giving extra help and attention to poor Ben, who sounds like he does not have an orderly family life, and is probably behind academically.\n\nNTA, OP.  Keep sticking up for your kids.", "There's been absolutely no indication he's done anything wrong, mean, or dangerous. She literally doesn't like him because he whines and has boogers. Guess what? So does every other 9-year-old. Booking your daughter VIP tickets the exact same day just reeks of entitlement.", "See I think it sounds like she did encourage the other moms to", "IDK, it *is* convenient, BUT...\n\nMy child was at one point the Ben of the story. There was a girl in 3rd grade who was really good at handling my child's sensory issues, because of experience with a cousin. She was \"assigned\" to be my child's partner during every field trip and group project all year, even when partners weren't assigned.\n\nIt was fine that year, because they got along and both enjoyed it, but the next year, the new teacher tried to continue this practice, and it wasn't fun for her anymore. Myself AND her mother both had to protest to the AP at the same time, because when just her mother said something they ignored it.\n\nIt wasn't fair to her kid, obviously, but it wasn't fair to my kid either. Forcing one child to look after another puts the other into a position of being a burden, disliked, and sometimes bullied.\n\nAnyway... might be the same kind of thing with this OP, might not, but either way the teacher is out of line... if a child is that uncomfortable with a buddy, you make changes to the roster, you don't double down.", "It may be that the other students were allowed to pick their own buddy, which is not uncommon.  Op's edit not entirely clear to me", "Ok why was the teacher singling out op daughter I would go to the school board", "We can all feel sorry for Ben\u2014it sounds like the poor kid needs a friend. That doesn\u2019t mean OPs daughter has to be responsible for his happiness. There are other ways to integrate a student into a classroom.", "No, but forcing a girl to spend time with him when she doesn\u2019t want to doesn\u2019t solve anything. It\u2019ll just make her (and probably her friends) dislike him more. \n\nA better solution would be to help him make friends (talk to him about good hygiene practices such as that wiping boogers everywhere isn\u2019t ok, play games or do group tasks with the entire class that help the kids get to know each other, etc.).", "There\u2019s an edit. Yes, she was.", "Any time a teacher or parent tries to force a friendship,  they automatically become the AH. The teacher was trying to make it easier on herself-- not either student.", "I think OP made the right call because Ms.N could have easily lied and still had OP's daughter watch Ben. This way there is no chance the daughter would have a crappy trip. The kids are being punished because of Ms.N, not OP.", "I feel bad for the kid who needs to supervise the boy. She\u2019s 9.

If he\u2019s that difficult, his parents should come as his chaperone", "what reason does she have to let her kid go on the trip except to let that teacher get away with her bs?", "lmaoooo did u read it? they didnt let her daughter be stuck w a booger eating child so they pulled their kid from the trip and got her friends to do the same to go on their own", "OP did not ruin it for the other kids, Ms. N did.  Or maybe poorly behaving boy(s).  But not OP", "Ms. N is the one who forced a \"rule\" on Bryn that she didn't impose on any other student in the class, not OP. OP stood up for her daughter. The teacher is at fault here.", "OP did NOT ruin anything, she was protecting her daughter. Imagine if you were not allowed to play with your friends, but had to babysit another kid in the class, and get snot rubbed on you and the area around you? If you were not allowed to play with your friends, and had to just sit and deal with a kid that was NOT ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS all day? \n\nWe had a kid like that in my class, nobody was forced to baby sit him, and he ended up being put in a special ed class to help him learn better social behaviors and learn with a class more his speed. \n\nIf the teacher cannot cope with him, she should not be forcing a CHILD to.", "She's not ruining it for other kids.\nThe teacher ruined for the other kids.\n\nRepeat after me. This is the *teacher's* fault. If parents want someone to blame blame the teacher for being ah", "OP updated that her daughter was *the only* one assigned a buddy.  No one else in the class had an assigned buddy and were free to hang out with whomever they wanted.", "dude wipes his boogers on shit even at 9 u should know thats gross", "Seconded.", "The teacher has been spoken to about this many times, YET IT STILL CONTINUES. This is not a first time incident that was resolved peacefully. \n\nThe teacher only complained when a large number of students dropped out and their parents decided to take them, themselves. Teacher was fine with all of this, until the consequences affected HER. \n\nI know people like this. Until someone in authority deals with it, she will be sneaky and try to minimize her treatment of OP's child.\n\nWant to bet, ten minutes after they hit the park, teacher would be \"just let him ride with you this 3rd time, you can talk to your friends on lunch break! Stop being selfish, your friends were seated right on the seat in front of you on the bus! you couldn't SEE them, but you could still TALK to them!

There were a lot of ways to handle this so Ben had people to play with and Bryn could still be with her friends, but the teacher wouldn't budge. Then to find out her daughter is the only one who has to have a partner? And she was also told she was a bad person if she didn't partner with him? Sorry. This is all on the teacher. And the only reason Ms. N is backing down at all is because she knows it will come back on her if that trip is canceled.", "Only OP's daughter was assigned a \"buddy,\" the rest were not.", "The daughter is the only child who was assigned a \u2018buddy\u2019.

No one else had to, I was just almost always done early and the teacher made me do it instead of having free time. So while I'm inclined to agree with you, because this sub is filled with too good to be true stories and that detail is oddly convenient, I could also absolutely see a misguided teacher think she's helping by assigning a popular kid to spend time with an unpopular kid (and it sure sounds like Ben is). \n\nA lot of adults seem to treat kids as if they have zero recollection of what being a kid was actually like. I could absolutely see an adult thinking this would somehow make Ben more popular.", "A teacher pulled the same thing on my daughter in elementary school. She had a calming influence on a boisterous boy (they were playmates and he was otherwise a decent kid), so she was paired with him frequently. I spoke with her teacher and she immediately switched my daughter to a different table and going forward ensured all the kids rotated partners on school trips and events.\n\nNow Mom buying VIP tickets...that seems a bit 'Karenish' and far-fetched. But I'll assume that's what truly happened. What OP should/could have done:\n\n- insisted that her daughter attend without 'buddy' duty. It's NOT the job of a child to monitor classmate behavior. \n- brought this to the attention of the principal if the teacher still insisted on the 'buddy' system.\n- volunteer as a parent helper during the trip.\n- volunteer for a day in her daughter's classroom. See what's really going on.\n\n OP, what do you think will happen if your daughter's classmates see her skipping to the head of the line on the VIP pass? They will be jealous and resentful. These are KIDS. Your issue is with the teacher - WHY are you bringing kids into it?", "Normally I wouldn\u2019t believe this but I would totally do this if it were my kid. When my son was in grade 2 or 3 he was being bullied by another boy. I went and talked to the teacher a number of times. My son comes home from school and tells me he has been partnered with his bully for the school feild trip the next day. Guess who did not go on that feild trip. My son and I had a mother son day and the following day I went up to the school and had a very stern talk with the principal.", "How is it entitled? Her daughter was the only one who had to have a buddy. No one else. Simply because the teacher knew that the kids did not like that child. And ON TOP of that she doubles down and says \u201cwell she *has* to be his buddy because I said so.\u201d And only relented when it was causing her direct problems. I see no entitlement.", "But why does he get a buddy specially assigned to him?

But the other students did nothing, and the teacher at this point backed down, said she didn't have to do anything she didn't want to do. The mother already won. Punishment should happen to the teacher, not to the other kids. Honestly, the mom shutting down the trip likely will get out and could result in her child being bullied. I agree something should be done, but cancelling the trip shouldn't be, neither should raises the prices as some parents may not be able to afford it. The best outcome is the teacher is forced to pay the extra money for causing this mess.", "That is true UNTIL the teacher backed down. I agree she did the right thing initially. But not sending her now is punishing the kids, not the teacher. The fair thing would be for the teacher to pay the difference in cost but I am fairly sure they would just cancel the trip instead.", "We had buddies on every field trip at school and I still use that system as a teacher, it's not 'owed' gender based labour, it's called socialising kids.

Its not the truth. Change the story enough so everyone on reddit thinks im a hero. It's BS", "I seriously doubt the teacher said Bryn wasn't allowed to see her friends at all on this trip, and had to exclusively play with Ben and *only* Ben. Does that sound realistic to you? It certainly doesn't sound realistic or believable to me, and I think OP is giving us a *very* dramatized version of events. \n\nSince she is really popular, I'll bet the teacher just wanted Ben to be able to join the group that Bryn is a part of. I can't blame the teacher for trying to help the awkward, lonely kid in class find some friends.", "I have a hard time believing that. I have a hard time accepting that the school is allowing a bunch of 9-year-olds to do whatever they want with no buddy system. South Park has an entire episode about accountabilibuddies because that cliche is so accurate and something everybody who's ever been on a field trip has experienced. I especially think that they would have some sort of requirement that students stay in groups when you have young girls at a water park of all places.", "Where I grew up, it was common for public schools to have unnecessary school trips for leisure like a waterpark. If you couldn't afford it you could have the cost subsidized too", "I was what you would consider a social outcast. My mom was a crack head and I honestly didn\u2019t know how to behave. I only learned through tough situations like realizing my behavior didn\u2019t help me. \nIf they wanted to help the kid make a friend, it would have been worded that way. Instead they paired him with a well behaved girl. Girls are often forced to be caregivers.", "You\u2019re right, but forcing another kid to spend time with him won\u2019t help. It\u2019ll probably just make her and her friends dislike him even more.", "screw those kids lmaoooo none of them cared her daughters trip was ruined if they want to enjoy the water park those 8 kids should ask their parents to get them tickets to go just like this kid had to do", "yea but in this case the school is gonna look i to why 1 class didnt go on a field trip and hopefully fix the issue a school will only make a problem as big as u do so if they want this to stop they have to make it a big deal", "OP said Ms. N did the same thing to her older daughter with a group of misbehaving boys.

This is not on OP or her kid", "Sure she backed down because she was finally busted. \n\nIf OP backed down, there is no way this teacher is not going to make op's daughter pay in some form.

You gave her the chance to change it, and she didn't change it until it had an impact on her. She only cares about how bad she's going to look, having only having half the class go on a trip that should be fun for everyone and that everyone should want to go to! She also will probably have to explain why only half the kids are going when it's a water park! Explaining the situation will make her look bad, and she's only worried about that. Seeing as she's making repeat offenses of mistreating the children and ruining their fun, particularly your daughter's, I wouldn't trust her to lie about the reason half the kids aren't going and believe whatever lie she says just because she's a teacher. For this reason, I'd just tell the people about her everything that she's done. Your daughter isn't going to be the only one she does this to. So, while the other kids might miss out, I consider this to be far from petty. By not going and putting her in the hot seat, she's more likely to get called on the nonsense she's pulling. That means she'll be watched better or something else that hopefully keeps other kids from getting bullied by her. If you let it go, then she won't change. Just continue to bully her other students in the future. \n\n\nI could get if it was a buddy system thing and purely for safety. But they should get to choose their buddy and it should be a fun time. Not a forced thing that ruins your fun and reputation (and I know it's not his fault if he's deemed the \"weird\" kid because kids are super mean. But all the same, generally, people who hang out with the \"weird\" kid then become \"weird\" kids themselves. It's totally unfair, but she shouldn't put kids in that position) They're also 8 year olds who are almost 9, 9 year olds, and 10 year olds, I'd guess. The buddy should ultimately be a teacher since they simply won't break off into groups where they could get lost if their teachers are doing their jobs properly. Your husband is wrong about her feeling bad. If she did, she'd have seen your daughter was unhappy and made changes since it's supposed to be a fun event. You've also already paid your VIP tickets, and you probably bought yourself and / or your husband a ticket for the day. So, to have her go on the field trip now would mean you pay more.

(I was a room mom and help in these situations many times.) \n- buddy groups of 3 or 4 as someone else suggested (usually with a parent chaperone for each group)\n\n\nMy only other concern for OP is that Bryn\u2019s absence on the trip may be considered an unexcused absence with district/state. In most US school districts the rules on absences are unbending. Perhaps consider calling your kiddo in \u201csick\u201d and staying home that day and changing your ticket date with friends to another day. Then, I would definitely report this incident to the principal.", "Ditto. I was often put in groups with the \"bad kids\" on  group projects because the teacher's knew I was the only one who could handle it and would put up with their bullshit, right up through high school. One teacher even told me, about a student I constantly got paired with who I'd been in school with from a kindergarten through high school, \"You're the only person I know who can get John to do the work.\" John being the super popular class clown jag off kid who today would be diagnosed with ADHD in a fucking heartbeat.\n\nIn addition, my mom worked at the school in the special education department, with kids that had conditions like learning disabilities and Downs syndrome. In gym class, I was often paired to work with those girls because no one else wanted to work with them. The teacher knew who my mom was and knew that I would be understanding. But it was immensely difficult for someone who is 14 or 15 to be working with students like that and trying to get them to do physical education activities. I wasn't a teacher and it was very trying sometimes. However, a lot of the other students were incredibly cruel to these girls and at least I got to be a safe place for them sometimes. \n\nNTA, OP. Your daughter isn't responsible for being a teacher or a caregiver for other students. And she shouldn't feel bad because she doesn't want to. At the same time, as she ages it's important to make sure she understands to treat students who are different or have different abilities in school with care and compassion. Not saying that didn't happen here, but it could be an important additional lesson down the line.", "Same. We had to play with one kid who would slam toy trains and trucks into our heads and punch holes in the wall and punch us too. In hindsight, I think he was undiagnosed and having a meltdown.

Our dressing room got moved around and she left something behind.  When I went to the teacher to ask permission to go retrieve it, I ended up pushed against the wall and screamed at.  This was in the 70s.   I still remember it.  The abuse aside, as a 9 year old I should never  have been made responsible for a 6 year old.", "I feel exactly the same! She doesn't feel bad for her actions. The proof is in the fact that this was brought to the teacher's attention that her daughter was upset and that she was upset, yet the teacher stuck by it. That is ONLY until it effected HER! She didn't care that the girl was upset and is just being a bully because she can. Totally agree, NTA, and I hope that OP sticks to her guns on this one and decides to keep the VIP tickets and use those. I get half the kids might not get to go now, but that's definitely the teacher's fault rather than OP's because if the teacher had decided to change her mind sooner, none of this would have happened. It just prevents her from bullying her daughter in the future since it has consequences and prevents her from bullying other students in the future if her superiors get involved. That said, I think she would lie about why it happened and I personally would go to them and tell them why only half the class is going as well as everything else the teacher has done. That way they know this isn't an isolated incident and so she can't lie about the reason why. Because if she lies, in my experience, they believe the teacher.

I ended up working with people with disabilities so I guess they chose the right person, but don't choose an 11 year old to walk the autistic kid to and from the cafeteria.", "It could be that her daughter was the only one with an assigned buddy. It\u2019s been a while but when my school went on field trips they let us pick a buddy by sitting next to them on the bus. Then the teacher would write down the buddies and each section of the bus would be assigned an adult buddy too (depending on the trip 4-8 kids per adult). It\u2019s also odd that they\u2019re not doing buddies of the same gender. Most water parks have locker rooms (often with multiple exits) so it\u2019s make more sense if buddies were the same gender so they wouldn\u2019t have to separate to change or go to the bathroom.", "There\u2019s often chaperones on this sort of trip that are in charge of 5 or so kids, so they could be in the same group but 100% supposed to stick together, sit together, etc.", "I took that to mean that Bryn was the only kid assigned a buddy and the rest of the kids picked their own. Not so much there were no other pairs.", "That is really interesting - I 100% believe those studies after my own family\u2019s experiences. My daughter would have thrived in an all-girl class; boys and girls just mature and get interested in academics at different rates.", "Sadly though she should be prepared for possibility that the next level up is defensive and just interested in making it go away. \n\nIt\u2019s brilliant that she\u2019s created a situation where it has real-life consequences for the teacher regardless of whether she files a report (which I would agree she should do after the trip date if need be).", "OPs daughter is not an aide or a teacher, or an adult.  She's a child.  She's a student, and she should not be responsible for another student.  Let her be a kid!", "That's not Bryn's problem tho and OP already said her other kid had similar problems with the same teacher. There's having no other option and there's grooming female students to look after rough boys and basically do her job for her.", "It\u2019s not a child\u2019s job to be that aid.", "If the student needs constant supervision, the right move is for the teacher to require one of his parents to attend the field trip with the class so that they can properly supervise him.", "True, but that\u2019s not OP\u2019s daughter\u2019s problem. The teacher is forcing Bryn to babysit this boy, she\u2019s the only one who is required to have a \u201cbuddy\u201d and do what he wants, the rest of the kids are free to enjoy your day.", "If the teacher had not found a peer buddy for Ben, she would have to keep him right next to her all day while she supervised the rest of the students and managed everything single handedly. She'd also have Ben's parents complaining that he wasn't given the long leash the rest of the kids got (plus she'd have to deal with whatever other behavior problems cropped up). I will say it would have been better to buddy Ben up with a male student, although it's entirely possible that there wasn't one she trusted. When she didn't get enough parent chaperones and/or aides provided by the school, she should have cancelled the trip, but then she'd have to face the fallout from that.\n\nEducation is so underfunded and understaffed at this point, we can barely get anything done. The teacher has probably had it with all this crap and has one foot out the door. I can't blame her. \n\nOP, have you ever met Ben's parents? Did you speak to them about the situation?", "What in OP's post suggests to you that Ben needs an aid?", "I also wondered if what it meant was Brynn was assigned Brad but everyone else got to pick their buddy?", "Or if it was some kind of indoor water park in the off season weekdays running educational group rates.", "Isn't there more benefit in trying, though?  \n\nWouldn't it be better to ask for a sit down meeting and hope that Ms. N isn't some evil woman who's out to get OP daughter and just a teacher who was hopingbto give this kid Ben a good day of not being left out.  \n\nAs I'm typing this it makes sense. Put the least popular kid with the most popular girl (so popular kids rather stay home than not go on a trip if she's not there) in hope he be included.  Is it a bad idea, yes but doesn't mean she's some sexiest lazy teacher. \n\nMy main point is OP won and proved her point, to me the adult thing to do is now find a solution that helps everyone going forward.  OP going on this trip is a shortsighted win. She's still her daughter teacher when she gets back", "Am I not allowed to ask?  \n\nIt's kinda funny I'm getting down votes like \"how dare you ask a question\" lol", "Yes!!! The teacher would say the exact thing!!! Did we have the same teacher?!?! She would literally say \u201cwhen you get a job, what will you do if you have a coworker who refuses to work?\u201d Even at 8 years old, I said \u201cI would hope they\u2019d get fired.\u201d \n\nTo be fair, the teacher was refusing to do her job and never got fired so\u2026\u2026.", "Yes, I was the smart girl assigned to look after the struggling boy. In hindsight, I believe he had an undiagnosed learning disorder, and needed way more help than I could give. \n\nBut looking back on my own working life, I had periods at work where I unconsciously took on responsibility for my managers' emotions in the workplace. It took me a long time to unlearn that early training, that because I was \"smart\" I had to be responsible for everything and everyone.", "I chaperoned several field trips over the years, and that is the only way I have ever seen this done.  Never was one of the children assigned to watch, be with, another child.  Also, the teachers tend to put together groups of children who are friends to make it easier on the parent volunteers.", "Ooh this actually makes more sense. Still bad, but makes more sense than only Bryn having a partner.", "That's definitely true!", "Exactly.  The school needs to hire someone for this position.  My kids were always tasked with these jobs or made to sit next to the behavior problems because they could help them.", "The teacher knows how to do her job, but is not given support from administrators or the town that does not give them a proper budget.", "This is beyond the teacher. This is the administration not providing for this student. It's the district's fault as well for not supporting an adequate budget.", "No it is not. The teacher needs to push for an aid for this student. The administration needs to provide one.", "Absolutely. But in all honesty the school should provide this student with an aid. I taught Special Ed and had to accompany many kids on field trips. Some kids need a 1:1 on a field trip but don't necessarily need one in a school setting.", "Why should it be on OP to reach out to the other students parents?", "Or you live in a rural area or a very small community.", "I went to a public school in a large city for elementary (so, the same level Bryn is at) and our classes were around 20, I think a little less most years. We did have multiple classes per grade, but went on field trips separately. My best friend teaches middle school in the same city now, and their classes are similarly small. I think high schools tend to be bigger, but at least around where I grew up, there are more elementary schools just because elementary school kids need more time and attention.", "Honestly I think Ms.N needs to make the first move. If OP just let's her daughter on the trip, there isn't a guarantee that the kids won't be screwed in the future or that Ms.N won't revert back to her old ways. But if Ms.N reaches out to OP for a meeting without being prompted by the school board, that would give OP reason to trust her, she would see that Ms.N is being genuine. The kids shouldn't have to be screwed out of a field trip, but OP should have reason to trust Ms.N and that things will be different.", "The rest of them probably got to pick their buddies.", "Funny how what we learn in elementary school reverberates like that through our lives. This right here is an argument for holding early educators to higher standards (and for pete\u2019s sake, paying and respecting them accordingly).", "The better option, that another commenter noted, would have been groups of 4. Then whoever was buddied with Ben would still have had friends instead of alone with the misbehaving student on a day that is supposed to be a reward.", "No, she doesn't know how to do her job, she has a habit of making her good girl students be the buffers for the bad kids. I went to a poor private school, the teachers never leaned on the students to handle the troublemakers, they did it themselves.\n\nNo others were paired up, just the daughter with that boy. A good teacher would never force a child from their friends to do the teacher's job of caring for the troubling one, who probably has issues a child isn't equipped for.\n\nHow are you not understanding this?", "This is a very reasonable point \u2014 and those places often suffer from the problems of having too few kids in a class/grade.", "K-3 in my city is max 30; 4-12 is max 33.", "No, OP says the rest of them were free to do what they wanted. Does that sounds realistic to you? Because it sounds like bs to me.", "Seems like it's different in different places, then. I would struggle to call a child or family entitled because their class size was small. We know nothing else about the school or the place where they live.", "There is a certain amount of privilege that comes along with being in a school that can take a non-academic field trip mid-year to a water park with third graders who learn in a class size of 20.  There are reasons that all of those things might not be positive, but it says something about the academic performance of the school, the availability of resources, the insurance policies of the school districts (I\u2019ve worked places were field trips to amusement/water parks were out because the district insurance wouldn\u2019t cover it.), close enough to a water park to make it a day drip, with the culture of the community that a field trip like this is available to them.\n\nI wasn\u2019t the original person who used the entitled language and I agree that on the whole we don\u2019t have enough info to conclude that the community isn\u2019t one with many students who only get to go on trips if they are subsidized by the school.  But several of the signs suggest it\u2019s likely.", "I see what you're saying in terms of privilege. There are many, many schools and school districts where, for the reasons you mentioned above, field trips like this would not be possible. This school is clearly better placed than others, to make this trip possible. \n\nHowever, I don't see signs that the students in this particular class are operating at different levels of privilege in this situation. Every student in this class is in a class of 20 students, and that's what this thread was about. But the teacher also doesn't mention anything about other parents struggling to pay the raised cost, and I feel like she'd have used this if she could. It feels to me like she didn't want to have to tell parents about having to pay extra, because she'd have to explain why.\n\nIt's also certainly not entitled to refuse to put your child in a situation where they have to babysit a problem child instead of enjoying the field trip. \n\nRegardless, I do appreciate where you're coming from, and the points you've raised. I'm just still not convinced they apply here."]}
