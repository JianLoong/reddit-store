She loves water and has been talking about it for months, so I was a bit thrown off when she came home crying a few days ago and told me she didn\u2019t want to go. I asked her why and she wouldn't tell me because she thought I\u2019d think she\u2019s a \u201cbad person.\u201d When I finally coaxed it out of her, she said her teacher \u201cMs. N\u201d has forced her to be the \u201cbuddy\u201d of her classmate \u201cBen\u201d for the entirety of the trip. She was to ride the bus with Ben to and from the trip, eat lunch with him, and go on all the rides with him instead of spending time with her friends. She then said nobody likes Ben because he whines whenever they have to do work and picks his nose and wipes boogers everywhere.\n\nI was horrified, not only because Ms. N had made Bryn do such a thing, but also because she had made her believe she was a bad person for not wanting to. Unfortunately this wasn\u2019t my first experience with Ms. N, as she frequently used my soft-spoken, intelligent older daughter as a \u201cbehavior buffer\u201d for the naughty boys until I threatened to report her to the superintendent. It\u2019s clear to me that Ms. N is still too comfortable with enforcing archaic gender roles on her kids and forcing girls to do unpaid emotional labor for the sake of the boys.\u00a0\n\nI immediately sent Ms. N an email condemning her actions. She sent me back an email with a bunch of bs that basically ended with \u201cif Bryn goes on the trip, she has to be Ben\u2019s buddy.\u201d *Fine.* I informed her Bryn would not be attending then. I immediately booked VIP tickets the same day her class was going so she could still go to the park and see her friends.\n\nWhat happened next I wasn\u2019t expecting. Bryn is quite popular, so I have gotten to know a lot of the moms in her class. When I let them know what Ms. N did, some of them were so horrified that they also pulled their kids out of the trip. In total, eight kids (out of a class of twenty) are either not going, or going with us. Today I got an email from Ms. N saying that because almost half of the class isn\u2019t going, they either have to raise the cost for the other students or not go at all. She practically begged me to let Bryn go and tell all the other parents to let their kids go, promising she wouldn\u2019t make Bryn do anything she didn\u2019t want to do. I told her she should have thought about that before she tried to make my daughter do *her* job.\u00a0\n\nMy husband said I was being a bit petty and that Ms. N clearly feels bad about what she did, and I should let Bryn go as I\u2019ve already gotten my way. He asked me if I really wanted to deprive children of what they\u2019ve been waiting for all year. The thing is, if this wasn\u2019t Ms. N\u2019s first offense I probably would have agreed, but she has a pattern of this type of behavior and hopefully this will put a stop to it. Plus, if she has to explain this to her superiors, I have receipts. Is my husband right?

In fact in light of your update I would make an appointment with the principal and teacher to discuss this matter further.  Your child was the only child enforced with special conditions on attendance on this trip, that did nothing for her benefit but make her an unpaid companion.   You already tried to speak to the teacher who clearly told you the parameters wouldn\u2019t change regardless of your chosen actions.  Again ignoring the mental state of your child needs for the sole benefit of another child. \n\nOther parents were horrified for just cause, while not being aggressive they instead chose not to send their own children while not agreeing with the teachers rigid constraints imposed on the excursion.   The follow on effect now has created further issues the teacher cannot solve on her own.  This highlights a much more serious issue within her teaching techniques and will involve the principal regardless, when other unhappy parents start contacting the school over the raised fees or increased cost to now attend the trip.   All which could have been easily avoided by the teacher upon the first contact made by a parent concerned over the wellbeing of her child, by her inflexible nature.   So to infer the fallout consequences are all down to you is extremely poor form still coming from the teacher.  This is the point that needs further discussion with the principal and a pathway made forward to stop using your child as a tool in regards to a socially inept child in the classroom.   Until the teacher stops using your child as a tool to use in the classroom or on excursions, this issue will only repeat itself.", "Am I the only one feeling sorry for Ben?", "NTA.

It almost sounds like Bryn was supposed to be his personal chaperone.\n\nFor children that age we used to have a parent chaperone for every 5 - 8 children, depending on where we were going.  Eight was a stretch.\n\nWe never went to a water park, but as a teacher I'd want a higher ratio of adults to children than that.  For pool parties we had an adult for every 2-3 kids.  Better to be cautious.....\n\nIn any event the teacher is lazy and mean.  She is the kind of teacher who gives others a bad name, besides annoying her colleagues.  \n\nShe needs to be giving extra help and attention to poor Ben, who sounds like he does not have an orderly family life, and is probably behind academically.\n\nNTA, OP.  Keep sticking up for your kids.", "There's been absolutely no indication he's done anything wrong, mean, or dangerous. She literally doesn't like him because he whines and has boogers. Guess what? So does every other 9-year-old. Booking your daughter VIP tickets the exact same day just reeks of entitlement.", "See I think it sounds like she did encourage the other moms to", "IDK, it *is* convenient, BUT...\n\nMy child was at one point the Ben of the story. There was a girl in 3rd grade who was really good at handling my child's sensory issues, because of experience with a cousin. She was \"assigned\" to be my child's partner during every field trip and group project all year, even when partners weren't assigned.\n\nIt was fine that year, because they got along and both enjoyed it, but the next year, the new teacher tried to continue this practice, and it wasn't fun for her anymore. Myself AND her mother both had to protest to the AP at the same time, because when just her mother said something they ignored it.\n\nIt wasn't fair to her kid, obviously, but it wasn't fair to my kid either. Forcing one child to look after another puts the other into a position of being a burden, disliked, and sometimes bullied.\n\nAnyway... might be the same kind of thing with this OP, might not, but either way the teacher is out of line... if a child is that uncomfortable with a buddy, you make changes to the roster, you don't double down.", "It may be that the other students were allowed to pick their own buddy, which is not uncommon.  Op's edit not entirely clear to me", "Ok why was the teacher singling out op daughter I would go to the school board", "We can all feel sorry for Ben\u2014it sounds like the poor kid needs a friend.

There are other ways to integrate a student into a classroom.", "No, but forcing a girl to spend time with him when she doesn\u2019t want to doesn\u2019t solve anything. It\u2019ll just make her (and probably her friends) dislike him more. \n\nA better solution would be to help him make friends (talk to him about good hygiene practices such as that wiping boogers everywhere isn\u2019t ok, play games or do group tasks with the entire class that help the kids get to know each other, etc.).", "There\u2019s an edit. Yes, she was.", "Any time a teacher or parent tries to force a friendship,  they automatically become the AH. The teacher was trying to make it easier on herself-- not either student.", "I think OP made the right call because Ms.N could have easily lied and still had OP's daughter watch Ben. This way there is no chance the daughter would have a crappy trip. The kids are being punished because of Ms.N, not OP.", "I feel bad for the kid who needs to supervise the boy. She\u2019s 9.

Or maybe poorly behaving boy(s).  But not OP", "Ms. N is the one who forced a \"rule\" on Bryn that she didn't impose on any other student in the class, not OP. OP stood up for her daughter. The teacher is at fault here.", "OP did NOT ruin anything, she was protecting her daughter. Imagine if you were not allowed to play with your friends, but had to babysit another kid in the class, and get snot rubbed on you and the area around you? If you were not allowed to play with your friends, and had to just sit and deal with a kid that was NOT ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS all day? \n\nWe had a kid like that in my class, nobody was forced to baby sit him, and he ended up being put in a special ed class to help him learn better social behaviors and learn with a class more his speed. \n\nIf the teacher cannot cope with him, she should not be forcing a CHILD to.", "She's not ruining it for other kids.\nThe teacher ruined for the other kids.\n\nRepeat after me.

No one else in the class had an assigned buddy and were free to hang out with whomever they wanted.", "dude wipes his boogers on shit even at 9 u should know thats gross", "Seconded.", "The teacher has been spoken to about this many times, YET IT STILL CONTINUES. This is not a first time incident that was resolved peacefully. \n\nThe teacher only complained when a large number of students dropped out and their parents decided to take them, themselves. Teacher was fine with all of this, until the consequences affected HER. \n\nI know people like this. Until someone in authority deals with it, she will be sneaky and try to minimize her treatment of OP's child.\n\nWant to bet, ten minutes after they hit the park, teacher would be \"just let him ride with you this 3rd time, you can talk to your friends on lunch break! Stop being selfish, your friends were seated right on the seat in front of you on the bus! you couldn't SEE them, but you could still TALK to them! You can't have your way ALL the time, that's selfish!\"", "Why?", "How is it exaggerated? Where you there? Do you have the emails? Do you think women owe men labour?", "WRONG. YTA for writing this comment.", "It didn't really have anything to do with the kid. It was about the teacher forcing OP's daughter into doing something she wasn't comfortable with. There were a lot of ways to handle this so Ben had people to play with and Bryn could still be with her friends, but the teacher wouldn't budge. Then to find out her daughter is the only one who has to have a partner? And she was also told she was a bad person if she didn't partner with him? Sorry. This is all on the teacher. And the only reason Ms. N is backing down at all is because she knows it will come back on her if that trip is canceled.", "Only OP's daughter was assigned a \"buddy,\" the rest were not.", "The daughter is the only child who was assigned a \u2018buddy\u2019.

No one else had to, I was just almost always done early and the teacher made me do it instead of having free time. So while I'm inclined to agree with you, because this sub is filled with too good to be true stories and that detail is oddly convenient, I could also absolutely see a misguided teacher think she's helping by assigning a popular kid to spend time with an unpopular kid (and it sure sounds like Ben is). \n\nA lot of adults seem to treat kids as if they have zero recollection of what being a kid was actually like. I could absolutely see an adult thinking this would somehow make Ben more popular.", "A teacher pulled the same thing on my daughter in elementary school. She had a calming influence on a boisterous boy (they were playmates and he was otherwise a decent kid), so she was paired with him frequently. I spoke with her teacher and she immediately switched my daughter to a different table and going forward ensured all the kids rotated partners on school trips and events.\n\nNow Mom buying VIP tickets...that seems a bit 'Karenish' and far-fetched. But I'll assume that's what truly happened. What OP should/could have done:\n\n- insisted that her daughter attend without 'buddy' duty. It's NOT the job of a child to monitor classmate behavior. \n- brought this to the attention of the principal if the teacher still insisted on the 'buddy' system.\n- volunteer as a parent helper during the trip.\n- volunteer for a day in her daughter's classroom. See what's really going on.\n\n OP, what do you think will happen if your daughter's classmates see her skipping to the head of the line on the VIP pass? They will be jealous and resentful. These are KIDS. Your issue is with the teacher - WHY are you bringing kids into it?", "Normally I wouldn\u2019t believe this but I would totally do this if it were my kid. When my son was in grade 2 or 3 he was being bullied by another boy. I went and talked to the teacher a number of times. My son comes home from school and tells me he has been partnered with his bully for the school feild trip the next day. Guess who did not go on that feild trip. My son and I had a mother son day and the following day I went up to the school and had a very stern talk with the principal.", "How is it entitled? Her daughter was the only one who had to have a buddy. No one else. Simply because the teacher knew that the kids did not like that child. And ON TOP of that she doubles down and says \u201cwell she *has* to be his buddy because I said so.\u201d And only relented when it was causing her direct problems. I see no entitlement.", "But why does he get a buddy specially assigned to him? Even if he\u2019s the most charming kid on earth, this girl wants to hang with her friends, and she\u2019s the only one not allowed to.", "how is it entitled to want her daughter to be able to have fun with her friends, like everyone else on the trip is allowed to do?", "The school is taking a class size of 20 to a water park, everyone here is somewhat entitled", "> See I think it sounds like she did encourage the other moms to\n\nNot saying you are wrong but then why would she;\n\n>  I immediately booked VIP tickets the same day her class was going so she could still go to the park and see her friends.\n\nIt seems like she is expecting other children to go.", "She said she mentioned it to the other moms, so it\u2019s possible.

The receipts of all their conversations and proof that Mrs. N is doing a bad job.  \n\nWhy not you know bring that to her superiors and let them take action.  Seems more like to me she's hoping the class trip being canceled will make them look into it instead of bringing it to their attention.  \n\nIf she wanted change that's what she would do instead she's just playing this game that affects children.  She's the adult and this something a petty teenager will do.", "It sounds to me that he's a social outcast. I'm a middle school teacher, and I see where that leads as kids get older. It sucks that this poor kid doesn't have any friends.", "So the 8 kids who want to go on the trip can.", "Did you make it to the end where the teacher said she doesn't have to be partners with the kid?", "He's a 9 year old who picks his nose,  don't make this into a gender thing.", "She got her point across and was getting what she wanted, it is fair to punish the teacher not the kids.", "I agree. But the other students did nothing, and the teacher at this point backed down, said she didn't have to do anything she didn't want to do. The mother already won. Punishment should happen to the teacher, not to the other kids. Honestly, the mom shutting down the trip likely will get out and could result in her child being bullied. I agree something should be done, but cancelling the trip shouldn't be, neither should raises the prices as some parents may not be able to afford it. The best outcome is the teacher is forced to pay the extra money for causing this mess.", "That is true UNTIL the teacher backed down. I agree she did the right thing initially. But not sending her now is punishing the kids, not the teacher. The fair thing would be for the teacher to pay the difference in cost but I am fairly sure they would just cancel the trip instead.", "We had buddies on every field trip at school and I still use that system as a teacher, it's not 'owed' gender based labour, it's called socialising kids. It's how we understand to work with people and live as a society, but clearly some of you weren't taught that because you have no idea how to do that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI promise you, no school trip is making two kids be buddies and non of the others. Its not the truth. Change the story enough so everyone on reddit thinks im a hero. It's BS", "I seriously doubt the teacher said Bryn wasn't allowed to see her friends at all on this trip, and had to exclusively play with Ben and *only* Ben. Does that sound realistic to you? It certainly doesn't sound realistic or believable to me, and I think OP is giving us a *very* dramatized version of events. \n\nSince she is really popular, I'll bet the teacher just wanted Ben to be able to join the group that Bryn is a part of. I can't blame the teacher for trying to help the awkward, lonely kid in class find some friends.", "I have a hard time believing that. I have a hard time accepting that the school is allowing a bunch of 9-year-olds to do whatever they want with no buddy system. South Park has an entire episode about accountabilibuddies because that cliche is so accurate and something everybody who's ever been on a field trip has experienced. I especially think that they would have some sort of requirement that students stay in groups when you have young girls at a water park of all places.", "Where I grew up, it was common for public schools to have unnecessary school trips for leisure like a waterpark. If you couldn't afford it you could have the cost subsidized too", "I was what you would consider a social outcast. My mom was a crack head and I honestly didn\u2019t know how to behave. I only learned through tough situations like realizing my behavior didn\u2019t help me. \nIf they wanted to help the kid make a friend, it would have been worded that way. Instead they paired him with a well behaved girl. Girls are often forced to be caregivers.", "You\u2019re right, but forcing another kid to spend time with him won\u2019t help. It\u2019ll probably just make her and her friends dislike him even more.", "screw those kids lmaoooo none of them cared her daughters trip was ruined if they want to enjoy the water park those 8 kids should ask their parents to get them tickets to go just like this kid had to do", "yea but in this case the school is gonna look i to why 1 class didnt go on a field trip and hopefully fix the issue a school will only make a problem as big as u do so if they want this to stop they have to make it a big deal", "OP said Ms. N did the same thing to her older daughter with a group of misbehaving boys. I think that's what the commenter is referring to.", "I agree the kids shouldn't be blamed, as none of this is their fault. It lies solely on the teacher. I get the impression that this is a private school and the teacher has done things like this before. The way the other parents jumped on leaving the trip? There's more going on here than what we know, I think.", "The teacher backed down this ONE time.   I doubt she will change.  The school needs to figure out how to handle this better.  This is not on OP or her kid", "Sure she backed down because she was finally busted. \n\nIf OP backed down, there is no way this teacher is not going to make op's daughter pay in some form. She has already manipulated this child and SENT HER HOME IN TEARS. I would NEVER allow this teacher unsupervised around my child, in the same scenario she tried to create for her. NOPE. \n\nShe is an abuser. the end.", "So your objection to the story is that you think sexism doesn't exist, and women inherently owe the world to socialize men? As a quiet girl, I was forced to be uncomfortable and deal with rowdy boys I was paired with all my childhood. I'm glad OP isn't letting the teacher force Bryn to do the job of the parents.", "Thank you. I\u2019m honestly worried for our future children because of how far I had to scroll to find the only logical answer in this I hope bullshit post", "Well hopefully you\u2019re a math teacher because you clearly didn\u2019t ready how her child was the only one assigned a buddy but since you love the kids so much you go watch him.", "You could be right.

This is that, we don't have the full story.", "Yes, her edit is especially questionable. Bryn was the only one who had to have a buddy on the school trip? Really?\n\nWe used the buddy system for every single field trip I went on as a kid, and our buddies were always assigned, either randomly or alphabetically. It wasn't some huge ordeal, it was simply for safety.", "Yep, we're talking about the same show. Only reason I brought it up, as stated, is that everyone can relate to that on a field trip.

She doesn't exist to take care of misbehaving boys. Do you think she ruined it because she has boundaries?", "No, not at all. I mean, it's gross, but he's a kid. \n\nMaybe I misunderstood, lol. I thought the commenter was talking about the previous issues OP had with Ms. N in relation to her older daughter who already went through her class.

Neither would any other teacher, which is why I don't believe OP's narrative at all. \n\nI'll bet the teacher just wanted Bryn to help Ben be a part of a group and maybe find some friends.
