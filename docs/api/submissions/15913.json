I was hospitalized in the ICU and received multiple treatments to save my life. During this time, my husband stayed by my side and was understandably stressed because I was unstable for weeks. A few days after delivery, his sister T messaged him, asking where our son was. My husband told her she should come to see me first before seeing the baby because I was not well. His sister interpreted this as me being upset that people were not coming to see me and that I needed support. However, I was totally out of it and did not want to be seen by anyone. The only person I wanted to see was my newborn, whom I couldn\u2019t hold well because my hands were swollen.\n\nHis sister then told her half-sister the same thing, and the half-sister thought making a post on Facebook would be a good idea to get me support and prayers. She did so, but I had set up my Facebook settings so no one could post on my wall unless I approved it. So the post wasn\u2019t visible to my contacts. She kept calling and messaging my husband to ask him to fix it, but he doesn't have social media and didn't know how to do it on my Facebook. He told her that I had not asked for the phone and that I was barely awake and my hands were too swollen to use a phone. Also, my parents had my phone with them as they were in the pediatric room caring for my newborn, and it was the only way for them to communicate with my husband, who stayed in the ICU. Finally, she came to the hospital to get into my phone to approve the post.\n\nThe half-sister had all the right intentions, thinking that I wanted people to come to see me. But at that time, my husband told her it was inappropriate for her to insist on the Facebook post when he was so stressed about me pulling through. He didn\u2019t know why she was doing it or what his sister had told the half-sister. But the half-sister was so upset about that comment that she cut my husband off completely and has not seen our son. It has been three years, and my husband has reached out multiple times and even apologized, but she doesn\u2019t want to do anything.\n\nWhat is missing here? Is there anything he can do, or is this a lost battle?", "created_utc": 1682697264, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131ymvu/aita_for_saying_sister_was_inappropriate_to/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That is very strange that she was so insistent on getting that posted when it was very obvious your husband and you had much more important things going on. Sounds like she wanted the attention for being a \u201cgood\u201d sister and wanted sympathy as well.", "Oh wow...\n\nNTA\n\nHope you are not obsessing about this...\n\nI'd tell you to let it cool down, that she would come over when she realizes how petty it is to obsess over a FB post, but that should be dead cold by now... \n\nObviously you are missing something else, don't give up, but don't let eat you, if that is possible?", "NTA. She came to the hospital for fucking *facebook settings*?? You\u2019re being very generous, but the half-sister did not have \u201cthe right intentions\u201d. She wanted everyone\u2019s attention on facebook and wanted to use your private and difficult situation for it.\n\nWhat she did was so inappropriate that I don\u2019t think this will get fixed. You mentioned that your husband has apologized to her over and over (probably she wants groveling), but that isn\u2019t right. You and your husband did nothing wrong. You were in the ICU and she was mad over a facebook post and adding to your husband\u2019s stress. That wasn\u2019t supportive, constructive, or helpful.\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t understand how inappropriate she was being, she\u2019ll just do it again. Do you really want your family around that drama?", "Wait, you were close to death and she was worried about a Facebook post? I thought it was common knowledge that when someone was having a baby you waited for them to publicly share information before you try and share it yourself. And when things are seriously wrong as they were with you, the most basic thing you can do is give the new parents some space until the family make it home from the hospital. NTA", "NTA. Ah yes, that's what a lady that nearly died giving birth needs. Stress about a Facebook post.\n\nMaybe they had good intentions, but they messed up badly.\n\nIf they want to still be upset about it, that's their problem, not yours. Glad that you and the little one are fine now.", "NTA. Your husbands sisters sounds like self centered b\\*-persons. Not considering you or your husbands battle and struggels at that time. Just wanting to see the baby. And wanting to made a post avalible (to get likes themself and fell as if they were doing anything, everytime someone would post under their post or give a like).\n\nThere is nothing to apologice for. It is amazing that your husband didn't snapped anytime sooner. If I would be in his shoes - the moment someone insists I should look at my wifes facebook page to aprove a post, I would snap at them, if the are in their right mind. There are more important things.", "NTA.  I gave birth to my son at 28 weeks.  Although, I was okay, our baby wasn't.  He was in the NICU for over a month and he was all I could think about night and day.  I was only able to see and try and hold him three times a day.  Many close friends wanted to come see me (they wouldn't allow anyone other than parents and grandparents into the NICU).\n\nAlthough their support and well intentions were well received, I simply told them that I wasn't in a good place at the moment and my sole focus was my baby.  Sitting down and having conversations with others was the last thing I wanted or needed at the time.  They understood and respected my wishes.\n\nIf any one of my relatives or close friends had posted that I needed visitors and support on my FB wall during this time, I would have immediately shut that down.  Your SIL's intentions were coming from a good place; however, extremely miscalculated.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sure their intentions were pure but they messed up.", "NTA weird to do all that for an FB post", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was not her business at all to post any of your business on Facebook. If she can't understand that, maybe no contact is best.", "NTA it sounds like to me that the trash took itself", "It\u2019s a lost issue. Your husband did everything right. But the half-sister is pissed still which is a red flag that she\u2019s probably very immature. Your husband cared for you and your parents cared for your son. There wasn\u2019t anything else to be done. She just won\u2019t accept that she wasn\u2019t in the right.", "NTA but have you considered that seeing a bunch of people posting \"thoughts and prayers\" on social media might have miraculously fixed you?  You could have been home the next day lol /s", "NTA- you don\u2019t harass people or their significant others while they\u2019re in the hospital for any reason. You also don\u2019t post on social media about other people\u2019s health without their express permission. No matter what her intentions were the half sister should have left you both alone after she realized her post wasn\u2019t going through. \n\nThe fact that she kept bothering you both about it and cut you all off when rebuked shows she lacks maturity.", "NTA\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude2dWhat's wrong with ppl like... Maybe she could actually care and check how y'all were doing instead of obsessing over socials??? \nAlso idk why she got an apology \ud83d\ude15 she should be the one apologizing to begin with. \ud83e\udd27", "Thank you, its sad because she is actually the most normal of the inlaws and it would have been nice for our son to have a relationship with her.", "Thank you, we initially thought she was inappropriate. But after being bombarded by the rest of the family about how terrible we have been for years now, started to doubt if we were being AH. We have sent christmas cards and such with no response. I think it is time to move on. And you are ight, we dont need this around our son.", "Well guess again, because good isn't what a normal thinking person would do", "She\u2019s pretty crazy if being told *hey, my wife almost died, and she\u2019s still recovering, now isn\u2019t the time for Facebook*  made her cut him and you off. \n\nTBH, if she\u2019s like this, perhaps it\u2019s better your kid is around that.", "What extra gets me is that she could have done it and gotten around your settings by herself by simply making a post to her own wall and not tagging you by name.  Something like thoughts and prayers for my sil who is the icu and her newborn baby.  Done without any of the harassment.\nI don't think it needed to be done at all though and her being mad at all is absurd but I'm just extra confused by why she didn't just do it that way.", "I hope your health is doing better now! I had a high-risk pregnancy so I feel extra mad for you. I can\u2019t even imagine trying to recuperate peacefully when someone\u2019s trying to insert themselves in my business."]}
