I was hospitalized in the ICU and received multiple treatments to save my life. During this time, my husband stayed by my side and was understandably stressed because I was unstable for weeks. A few days after delivery, his sister T messaged him, asking where our son was. My husband told her she should come to see me first before seeing the baby because I was not well. His sister interpreted this as me being upset that people were not coming to see me and that I needed support. However, I was totally out of it and did not want to be seen by anyone. The only person I wanted to see was my newborn, whom I couldn\u2019t hold well because my hands were swollen.\n\nHis sister then told her half-sister the same thing, and the half-sister thought making a post on Facebook would be a good idea to get me support and prayers. She did so, but I had set up my Facebook settings so no one could post on my wall unless I approved it. So the post wasn\u2019t visible to my contacts. She kept calling and messaging my husband to ask him to fix it, but he doesn't have social media and didn't know how to do it on my Facebook. He told her that I had not asked for the phone and that I was barely awake and my hands were too swollen to use a phone. Also, my parents had my phone with them as they were in the pediatric room caring for my newborn, and it was the only way for them to communicate with my husband, who stayed in the ICU. Finally, she came to the hospital to get into my phone to approve the post.\n\nThe half-sister had all the right intentions, thinking that I wanted people to come to see me. But at that time, my husband told her it was inappropriate for her to insist on the Facebook post when he was so stressed about me pulling through. He didn\u2019t know why she was doing it or what his sister had told the half-sister. But the half-sister was so upset about that comment that she cut my husband off completely and has not seen our son. It has been three years, and my husband has reached out multiple times and even apologized, but she doesn\u2019t want to do anything.\n\nWhat is missing here? Is there anything he can do, or is this a lost battle?", "created_utc": 1682697264, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131ymvu/aita_for_saying_sister_was_inappropriate_to/", "score": 255, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That is very strange that she was so insistent on getting that posted when it was very obvious your husband and you had much more important things going on. Sounds like she wanted the attention for being a \u201cgood\u201d sister and wanted sympathy as well.", "Oh wow...\n\nNTA\n\nHope you are not obsessing about this...\n\nI'd tell you to let it cool down, that she would come over when she realizes how petty it is to obsess over a FB post, but that should be dead cold by now... \n\nObviously you are missing something else, don't give up, but don't let eat you, if that is possible?", "NTA. She came to the hospital for fucking *facebook settings*?? You\u2019re being very generous, but the half-sister did not have \u201cthe right intentions\u201d. She wanted everyone\u2019s attention on facebook and wanted to use your private and difficult situation for it.\n\nWhat she did was so inappropriate that I don\u2019t think this will get fixed. You mentioned that your husband has apologized to her over and over (probably she wants groveling), but that isn\u2019t right. You and your husband did nothing wrong. You were in the ICU and she was mad over a facebook post and adding to your husband\u2019s stress. That wasn\u2019t supportive, constructive, or helpful.\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t understand how inappropriate she was being, she\u2019ll just do it again. Do you really want your family around that drama?", "Wait, you were close to death and she was worried about a Facebook post? I thought it was common knowledge that when someone was having a baby you waited for them to publicly share information before you try and share it yourself. And when things are seriously wrong as they were with you, the most basic thing you can do is give the new parents some space until the family make it home from the hospital. NTA", "NTA. Ah yes, that's what a lady that nearly died giving birth needs. Stress about a Facebook post.\n\nMaybe they had good intentions, but they messed up badly.\n\nIf they want to still be upset about it, that's their problem, not yours. Glad that you and the little one are fine now.", "NTA. Your husbands sisters sounds like self centered b\\*-persons. Not considering you or your husbands battle and struggels at that time. Just wanting to see the baby. And wanting to made a post avalible (to get likes themself and fell as if they were doing anything, everytime someone would post under their post or give a like).\n\nThere is nothing to apologice for. It is amazing that your husband didn't snapped anytime sooner. If I would be in his shoes - the moment someone insists I should look at my wifes facebook page to aprove a post, I would snap at them, if the are in their right mind. There are more important things.", "NTA.  I gave birth to my son at 28 weeks.  Although, I was okay, our baby wasn't.  He was in the NICU for over a month and he was all I could think about night and day.  I was only able to see and try and hold him three times a day.  Many close friends wanted to come see me (they wouldn't allow anyone other than parents and grandparents into the NICU).\n\nAlthough their support and well intentions were well received, I simply told them that I wasn't in a good place at the moment and my sole focus was my baby.  Sitting down and having conversations with others was the last thing I wanted or needed at the time.  They understood and respected my wishes.\n\nIf any one of my relatives or close friends had posted that I needed visitors and support on my FB wall during this time, I would have immediately shut that down.  Your SIL's intentions were coming from a good place; however, extremely miscalculated.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sure their intentions were pure but they messed up.", "NTA weird to do all that for an FB post", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But the half-sister is pissed still which is a red flag that she\u2019s probably very immature. Your husband cared for you and your parents cared for your son.

You could have been home the next day lol /s", "NTA- you don\u2019t harass people or their significant others while they\u2019re in the hospital for any reason. You also don\u2019t post on social media about other people\u2019s health without their express permission. No matter what her intentions were the half sister should have left you both alone after she realized her post wasn\u2019t going through. \n\nThe fact that she kept bothering you both about it and cut you all off when rebuked shows she lacks maturity.", "NTA\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude2dWhat's wrong with ppl like...

But after being bombarded by the rest of the family about how terrible we have been for years now, started to doubt if we were being AH. We have sent christmas cards and such with no response. I think it is time to move on. And you are ight, we dont need this around our son.", "Well guess again, because good isn't what a normal thinking person would do", "She\u2019s pretty crazy if being told *hey, my wife almost died, and she\u2019s still recovering, now isn\u2019t the time for Facebook*  made her cut him and you off. \n\nTBH, if she\u2019s like this, perhaps it\u2019s better your kid is around that.", "What extra gets me is that she could have done it and gotten around your settings by herself by simply making a post to her own wall and not tagging you by name.  Something like thoughts and prayers for my sil who is the icu and her newborn baby.  Done without any of the harassment.\nI don't think it needed to be done at all though and her being mad at all is absurd but I'm just extra confused by why she didn't just do it that way.", "I hope your health is doing better now!

She didn't even bother to reach out to check on the wellbeing of you or your child in the 3 years since.....\n\nThe fact that she then also rallied family members to attack you - aka the person who was gravely ill and in the ICU - shows that she was never concerned and her heart was **not** in the right place. She was and is an attention seeking AH.", "Your thinking like a normal rational person, half sister obviously wanted the attention and drama that her harassment would bring. It\u2019s absolutely appalling that OPs in-laws are so dedicated to not rocking the boat that they have been calling her and her husband terrible for not immediately jumping up to do the bidding of his half sister. How do they not understand that been in the ICU means that OP was in no fit sate to pander to half sister and that OPs husband was far to worried about his wife?

Don't you know that when someone asks for prayers, that gives them a free pass for all obnoxious behavior?\n\nEven OP is kidding herself into thinking it was done with \"all the right intentions\".

That she called continuously, and then showed up to the hospital is insane. At best she has no common sense, at worst. She is social media, obsessed, and just wanted the attention, while you were near death. Either way, maybe it\u2019s good riddance.", "NTA, post about yourself all you want on FB, but I hate when people that do that start including others without their permission. It happened to me and cost me a weeks pay at work (during COVID, they misconstrued my symptoms as COVID when it was something non-contagious). It is incredibly inappropriate, esp. with medical info", "NTA \n\n\nPeople get real weird about facebook", "NTA.  I think there was a lot of miscommunication.  Why did you husband suggest visiting you first?   Her being so insistent about the FB stuff is odd and getting mad about it is more peculiar.  Sounds like the battle is lost since she hasn't bothered with you all in three years.  Sometimes there's nothing you can do to fix a broken relationship.  Too bad she doesn't want to talk about it, mend the relationship or meet your son.

You say your husband doesn\u2019t do social media and your in laws did not have a phone of their own. Was your husband calling people?  If the sisters were having to field a bunch of calls/texts from people wanting to know what was going on, I can see how they may have eventually become annoyed. Back in the day, it was someone at a pay phone with a roll of quarters, lol. People today expect to make a post that reaches everyone simultaneously. Also, as you were ill, are you sure of what went down between your husband and his sister?", "Group chats are usually the way to go in these situations. Once the \u201ccore\u201d group of family members know (ie: parents, siblings, grandparents), the rest usually figure it out for themselves by word of mouth through contact with the core group.\n\nSocial media should never be used to notify people of medical emergencies. Especially another person\u2019s medical emergency! If parents choose to put their young children on social media, the big announcement FB post should *always* come from them, at a time when everyone is home safe from the hospital. \n\nThis half-sister majorly overstepped boundaries and made a stressful situation even worse."]}
