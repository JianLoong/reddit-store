You simply stated that you didn\u2019t want to be involved with Ben, which seems fair considering he bullied you for your childhood. While it\u2019s in the past, it doesn\u2019t seem like Ben ever apologized for his actions and I tend to think bullying has a much bigger negative impact when you are a child, with lasting effects. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for your friend to be dismissive and say that it\u2019s in the past when it\u2019s something that remains an unresolved issue.", "Seems like a misleading title... it actually does NOT sound like you're asking Adam to choose between you, it sounds like you're telling him not to expect you to hang out with Ben. If that's accurate (which means your title is not accurate), then NAH.\n\nYou can choose not to be around Ben. That might put Adam in a hard spot at times, but it seems reasonable. I do not think you should scold Adam, make him feel bad, or unfriend him over his friendship with Ben. This is just one of those things where you have a friend who has a friend you don't like. It doesn't need to be a big thing.", "NTA but be ready to accept whatever choice he makes", "NTA", "NTA.

But honestly it\u2019s not even relevant at the end of the day because he was *your* bully and you are well within reason to not forgive or hang out with him.", "NTA, you should cut off your former friend.  Birds of a feather fly together.  Your friend probably is cut from the same cloth.", "So NTA.  If anyone tried to get me to be friendly with my childhood bully, I\u2019d say the same thing. There\u2019s nothing to discuss.  Now IF the former bully expresses an interest in making things right with me, it *might*be a different story, but that\u2019s a HUGE IF.  Your \u201cfriend\u201d may be showing you the sort of person he is if he\u2019s saying you\u2019re \u201cmaking him choose.\u201d You\u2019re not doing anything other than setting a healthy boundary for yourself. Keep up the good work and maybe the two assholes deserve each other.", "How bad WAS the bullying?", "NTA. You are under no obligation to be friends with your former bully. Adam has no right to force you into a friendship with Ben. If Adam has decided that the only way forward in a friendship with you is as a trio with Ben, well, that's his choice to make and you're better off without him.  \nI see nowhere that you are claiming Adam cannot be friends with Ben because Ben was terrible to you in your youth, or that a continued friendship with you is contingent on Adam ditching Ben. You aren't making Adam 'choose' between you at all, beyond who he wants to hang out with on a given day. Adam needs to grow up and learn that not all his friends have to be friends with each other as well.", "NTA\nYou\u2019re not making him choose. If he can\u2019t find time for you without Ben, he\u2019s the one making a choice.", "NTA you know Ben and don't like him, end of story. Doesn't matter the reasons you don't like him even though yours are very good, your friend should respect that you don't like Ben and will not hang out with him", "Bullying is also considered a traumatic event in a lot of cases, therapist once told me I repressed who I was for so long that I had to find myself again afterwards because I was severely bullied for over 4 years due to my disabilities and my whole personality. I sense this friend already knew and expected op to get over or be the bigger person, which tells me a lot about this friend of ops.", "For sure; childhood bullies cause the most trauma, and I\u2019m not sure why OP\u2019s friend would expect OP to brush it under the rug so quickly. OP\u2019s friend needs to learn empathy."]}
