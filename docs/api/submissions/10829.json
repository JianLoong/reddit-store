The break up was mutual and we stayed close friends. My girlfriend now, Josie, isn't a huge fan of me being friends with Olivia but is working towards accepting it with her therapist\n\nThe big thing is both of them come from different backgrounds. Olivia's mom is a NP and her dad's a lawyer, so financially her life has been good. She's the only children so a lot of attention was placed on her. \n\nJosie grew up in poverty and both her parents ODed when she super younger. her brother was her main guardian but a lot of her teen years was working so she could survive for herself. \n\nJosie admits she gets jealous when Olivia talks about her life, or when I start worrying about Olivia's mental health.\n\nJosie and her friend was discussing colleges. Olivia goes to one of the top 20 schools, while Josie goes to a CC. I proud of Olivia for getting in. Well Josie and her friend started talking about the kids who get in because their parents usually have a lot of money. I got the sense Josie was talking about Olivia.\n\nShe said she wasn't, but realistically students like Olivia have more opputurnities and resources that will help get admitted, compared to kids like herself, who are either working or at school. \n\nI told her Olivia worked really hard to get into that school.\n\nJosie said she knows that, she's just saying it's easier to do extracurricular and volunteer hours when you don't have to worry about how you're going to afford groceries.  \n\nI told her she was just jealous of Olivia again and it's getting really sad at this point. The admission team clearly saw something in her, that got her accepted beyond her social class, and maybe if Josie had balanced her time better she could have made it in a school like that.\n\nJosie left in tears with her friends.

I\u2019m far more impressed with an orphan who gets through community college than a lawyer\u2019s daughter who gets through an Ivy League school. \n\nWho the hell defends their ex when their current girlfriend is talking about how wealthy colleges reward privilege?", "YTA\n\nJosie didn't say anything wrong at all. She also wasn't directly talking about Olivia. \n\nI wonder how often you bring up Olivia to your gf. The fact that she has to be in therapy to be okay with it makes me wonder if Josie isn't the issue at all.", "YTA\n\nDefending your ex's achievements, that's fair.\n\nLashing out at your current girlfriend to defend your ex (who she hadn't insulted directly) by accusing her of being jealous and BLAMING her for not \"balancing\" her time while she had to support herself AS AN ORPHAN? Seriously? Yes her older brother took care of her but she had no parents, i.e. an orphan. So yes, you blamed an orphan for not managing their time better AS A TEENAGER while WORKING TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are TOTALLY the AH.  She deserves better than to be treated like this.  And you should TOTALLY express to your GF that you are proud for her going to CC.  Considering her background that is an achievement worthy of praise. She is not letting her circumstances keep her down and is just as admirable as getting into a \"good\" college.", "YTA. Josie was making a fair point about how admissions policies at top schools tend to favour wealthy applicants. (Many even have explicit policies favouring the children of alumni, most of whom are wealthy). As someone who went to an Ivy, I can assure you that what she's saying is very much true.\n\nHer point was fair. She didn't mention Olivia at all. You were the one who brought that up, and then decided to add a completely gratuitous insult to your girlfriend, who's done a great job coping in very difficult circumstances. I hope she dumps you.", "YTA. Josie is 100% correct. It is way easier to succeed when all of your basic needs are met, and even easier when they are exceeded.", "Wow, YTA. Josie busted her ass just to have food on the table, it does not compare at all to Olivia who studied hard. For Josie it was either extra curriculars or food. You are the asshole for even comparing them and not being insanely proud of Josie like every other person would be.", "YTA\n\nJosie is right. Even the most talented, hardworking student experiences poverty as a real barrier to opportunity. She didn't mention Olivia - you did - and then you completely dismissed Josie's experiences, insulted her and made her cry.\n\nMaybe time to be honest and admit you are not over Olivia, and it's causing problems for your relationship with Josie because *of course it is*.", "YTA. Ignoring the benefits of financial privilege to higher education is gross.", "YTA\n\nShe was right. She wasn\u2019t dissing Olivia - she even agreed that she worked hard to get in. She was just pointing out actual real-life differences in opportunity. Statistically supported real-life differences.\n\nYou owe her an apology.\n\n\u201cMaybe if Josie had balanced her time better she could have made it in a school like that.\u201d\n\nScrap that. No apology can save you from that statement. She deserves better.", "YTA. Really?  This is the hill you die on?  Being a cheerleader and champion for your ex when your current girlfriend is absolutely right.

You are right that to get into a top school, you have to put in serious effort that goes beyond just doing ok in school.  So Olivia did earn her way into a top school.  However, you took it too far and let it get personal, then attacked your girlfriend for her position.  You need to apologize and hope she doesn\u2019t dump you.", "YTA, and just get back together with Olivia since she seems like your priority over your GIRLFRIEND", "YTA. this isn't about siding with your girlfriend or your ex, it's about you spouting blatantly classist rhetoric to a woman who grew up under extreme poverty. you didn't \"defend your ex's achievements,\" you insulted your girlfriend due to disparaging assumptions you made on account of your apparent contempt for her background, just because she made the **entirely accurate** statement that a lot of kids get into top colleges because they're rich.", "YTA. She was right.", "YTA. You're clearly aware of the socioeconomic differences that allowed your ex to do so well in college and prevented your current gf from having the same opportunities, but instead of acknowledging that in conversation, you belittled your current gf and claimed that she's responsible for the hardship she faced as a child. \n\nYou're a terrible partner to Josie, and I hope she dumps you. She deserves someone who respects the hard work she's putting in for herself and her future. That's clearly not you.", "YTA!\n\nit\u2019s fine to be friends with your ex and it\u2019s understandable that Josie is uncomfortable to a certain extent but is working on it. \n\nIm sure Olivia worked hard but she obviously had advantages to get into those schools that Josie did not. However, what you said to Josie was so unbelievably tone deaf and ignorant. Balance her time better? How would she do that if she is going to school and working afterwards? She HAD NO TIME for extracurriculars, volunteer work, \u2014all the things that help you get admitted into prestigious schools! It is MUCH EASIER to do those things if you have a financially stable home. She did not, she had to worry about putting food on the table and surviving\u2014there was no room for \u201cbalancing her time\u201d because her time was spent SURVIVING because she had no such support system to lean back on.\n\nIf you value this relationship at all, go and apologize to her for what you said. Her feelings are valid and what she said is TRUE, Olivia worked hard but it\u2019s easier to work that hard when you have the resources to do so.", "Wow, you sound like a shitty partner to be honest. Sure be friends with an ex, your girlfriend is uncomfortable about your ex and what do you do? Stand up for your ex? Yta\nAlso sounds like you prioritize your ex over your current partner which is even worse.", "Yeah. Straight up YTA and I'm surprised that's all she did when she left. Are you really going to tell a person whose parents died when they were a kid that they needed better time management skills? I don't even know what else to say to you, you're really gross. I hope you grow out of this.", "YTA. It's literally a fact that someone who comes from a financially comfortable background with two parents is going to have an easier time of things. To deny it is foolish when there's so much data out there supporting this fact. \n\nTo be constantly gushing over Olivia in front of Josie and then to essentially tell Josie she isn't good enough to get into a good school bc she didn't maintain good grades It's a shitty thing to do. Sounds like she had A LOT on her plate and really WOULDN'T have as much help or as much privilege as Olivia did. So, there really was no need to white knight for your ex like that by insulting your current girlfriend for simply pointing out OBVIOUS FACTS!", "Hopefully your girlfriend will dump you, since you obviously care more about your ex than her.", "I was recently reading some numbers. For Ivy League schools, the children of the 1% have a 15X greater than they should chance of acceotance and enrollement.  \n\n\nThe children of the bottom 20% had a 7 times smaller chance of enrollment than their percebtage shoud give them.  \n\n\nThe chikldren of the 1% have a 100 times better chance of acceptance and enrollment.  \n\n\nAnyone but a eugenecist would think you are the asshole.", "Just date olivia bro", "You seem to have no respect or empathy for Josie, so why are you with her? And do you really think somebody who had to work to support herself while she was a minor had the opportunity to participate in the same number of extracurricular activities that the only child of two wealthy people did? You sound very socially blind and privileged.\n\nDo Josie a favor and break up with her. It doesn\u2019t sound like you even like her. \n\nYTA.", "YTA.\n\nJosie was speaking the truth there. It's all backed up with statistics. Stop championing for your ex; she doesn't need you running block for her.", "YTA\n\nShe wasn't even talking about Olivia just about social classes and balance her life better excuse you ???\n\nShe lost both parents  and required a job to support herself ! That means as an orphan teenager she had two full time jobs ( the real full time job and school ) she still managed to graduate school, and get into college. And your u think she should have worked hard then that??\n\nOlivia had two parents working and didn't have to do any of that ... They ran the same race but Olivia started 12 miles ahead \n\nThe reality is your still in love with your ex and are wearing blinders", "YTA - only mentioning how hard Olivia worked is what gets me. You explained earlier how much your gf has overcome to be where she is today with no praise or anything at all, but praise for the ex and accolades for her. All the points about money making things easier are valid whether she was directly talking about your ex or not.", "Tell me where she was putting down your ex or speaking an untruth, I'll wait.\n\n\nJosie is 100% correct that people like Olivia have it easier and have a better chance to focus on things that top colleges look for in potential students, Josie wasn't speaking down on Olivia at all in truth she was pretty much speaking down about herself and her circumstances & you being the awesome (/s) boyfriend that you are helped kick her down even farther. \n\n\nYTA", "YTA. Are you sure it was a mutual break up? Cause you sure are white knighting hard for someone that doesn\u2019t need it. This post is just gushing about Olivia while Josie is just an afterthought. \n\nJosie has valid points it is easier for Olivia to get into college because of her privilege. Privilege is not inherently bad or good. It usually just is. What you do with that is another issue.", "YTA\n\nJosie is spot on when she talks about the ability of wealthy families to do all the extra tuition and extracurricular activities needed to place their children at prestigious universities. That\u2019s not even talking about the peace of mind for the student at not having to work to pay tuition. \n\nNo matter how hard Olivia did or did not work, Josie is absolutely right.\n\nYou owe her an apology.", "YTA\n\n\nYou are ignorant and arrogant. It is actually sad how your gf lets you put her down while being in love with you.\n\n\n- you made it about olivia\n\n\n- it is a fact that getting in AND affording an ivy university is far easier if your parents support you fincially. You can't \"manage away\" working hours. Just do the fucking math. \n\n\n- you humiliated your gf you are supposed to love. Even if we forget that you made it about olivia, even if we forget that she talked facts and lets even assume your were right for a second (wich you arent), to pull such a stunt out of no where... i would break up with you.", "YTA.  It's ok to be friends with your ex but sheesh, stop rubbing your gf's face in it.  You don't need to talk to your gf about her. And if your girlfriend brings her up youcam deflect, or at least engage in conversation that is respectful and compassionate to BOTH of them.", "1. I can see that Josie has her insecurities but in this case, she wasn't directly addressing Olivia, right? I mean unless she specifically used Olivia's name or details in that conversation, you cannot accuse her of doing that. \n\n2. So I am going with YTA because you openly disparaged your current GF just because you \"got the sense\" that she was attacking your Ex. That was a bad move if you ask me.", "YTA - \u201cmaybe if you didn\u2019t work and basically become independent at a young age to help your brother provide for you and himself you could\u2019ve gotten where she got.\u201d\n\nDude, you kinda threw her upbringing into her face for making valid points with friends. They didn\u2019t outright said Olivia but she does fall into that camp and yeah, Olivia had far more options that your girlfriend because of the money her family had. \n\nAnd to bring up that she\u2019s jealous of Olivia in front of friends when that\u2019s something that you could\u2019ve brought up in private (even though you\u2019d still be an ass based on this situation) was just mean.

Life is so much easier when you have the opportunity", "YTA for the part where you said \u201cmaybe if you balanced your time better\u201d after you said she didn\u2019t have parents and worked to survive for herself. I think you need to check your own privilege. Are you proud of Josie for working through her whole life and making community college work? That\u2019s no small feat. Maybe if you built her up instead of tearing her down she wouldn\u2019t have to be jealous of Olivia.", "YTA dude. She has every right to feel her feelings about wealthier people having it easier than her. And she's right, they do. Instead, you made it about your ex, invalidated your gf, and, ugh, told her \"maybe if you worked harder...\" and \"you're just jealous...\"  You're pissed that she's got jealousy toward your ex, yet here you are deliberately comparing the two of them, and telling her why your ex is better than she is.\n\nWhy didn't you just listen to her? Honestly it sounds like you don't even like her. Fuck bro.", "YTA. You're the one who brought up Olivia and then kept bringing up Olivia. You obviously are way too focused on Olivia to actually date anyone else.", "YTA.\n\nYou're not over your ex and Josie doesn't want to hear about her.", "YTA\n\n\u201cBalanced her time better\u201d between what, food and a roof over her head instead of debate club and band practice?\n\nAre you as spoiled as Olivia?", "YTA. The point she made saying that Olivia surely did work hard, but that doesn't mean she didn't inherently have advantages is literally true, it's class/wealth privilege. Being privileged doesn't mean that person isn't a hard worker, but you just had to take offense anyway. And on top of that, you doubled down and insulted your g/f by saying she just should have balanced her time better. Ugh. Very much YTA 100%", "YTA she didnt say anything about Oliva and what she said is true. She had to work to eat, she had to pick studing or food on the table and you know that. Olivia had a lot of opportunities because she didnt have to worry and Yes it was also because of her hard work and that they did see something in her. This is an example cause life is unfair. I know if Josie had the same opportunities as Olivia she could have also goten in a top school. She didnt say that Olivia got in cause she has money or said anything like that! She is saying how she didnt get in because she didnt and how people who have money can get good classes they need and a lot more. \nETA: Last part meant it in the wrong way sorry", "YTA. She was making very valid points about access to education, money, and influence. It wasn't a personal attack against your rich ex that you're still into.\n\nDo you even like your gf?", "\"I told her she was just jealous of Olivia again and it's getting really sad at this point. The admission team clearly saw something in her, that got her accepted beyond her social class, and maybe if Josie had balanced her time better she could have made it in a school like that.\"\n\nYTA. This was an ignorant and cruel statement. You owe Josie an apology.", "YTA. Break up with Josie so she can be with someone who actually appreciates her and respects her.

You were completely out of line. Apologize, and maybe back off from Olivia for a while to work things out here - if Josie is even willing!\nBut again, speaking as someone from a privileged background myself - YTA.", "YTA Josie is right", "YTA. That wasnt defending your ex. That was fully just insulting your gf.", "LMAO. YTA. Why don\u2019t you go back to St Olivia? Clearly you can\u2019t handle someone speaking truth about Olivia\u2019s privilege and how it helped her.", "YTA\n\nYes, Josie is probably a little jealous - that would be natural.\n\nIn the other hand, one\u2019s background does matter.  Race, gender, sexuality, wealth, physical and mental abilities, etc all matter in who has a head start and who faces challenges.\n\nIt is easier for the kids from richer families to get into better colleges and universities.  These kids, like Olivia were granted a head start and can fly on the tailwinds of their parents.  They can typically concentrate on their studies and do extracurricular activities (which is what colleges and universities look at).  If teens, like your girlfriend, need to work or help out at home because of financial issues, they are less likely to graduation hs, never-mind make it into and afford college or university.  The fact your gf goes to cc, is in my opinion, fantastic.  She was able to beat greater challenges that Olivia n had to face to complete hs and go on to higher education.", "Josie has no parents,  comes from poverty and had to work to survive. \n\nThe ex had a stable upbringing and parents who could provide nicely for her. She could focus on her studies. \n\n\nShe was speaking the truth about how it's easier to focus on school, volunteering and extra activities when you don't have to work to survive. \n\nThese are facts. She didn't say ex didn't work hard or didn't deserve to be in the school she was in. \n\nConsidering where Josie is coming from, it's pretty incredible that she is taking care of herself - mentally and physically  - and is in college. \n\nAnd yet, you down played her accomplishments by saying she was just jealous of your ex and she needed better time management skills!?!?!. \n\nYTA and I'd be shocked if you still have a girlfriend.", "YTA - you seem to emphasize with your ex, but not your girlfriend. Wonder why?", "YTA\n\nYou're very dismissive of your gf and didn't say a single positive thing about her. You're clearly still in love with your ex.", "YTA, what the heck? Not only were Josie and her friends correct, they were also speaking generally.\n\nIt's kinda weird you went out of your way to defend Olivia when no one was attacking her.", "No, you\u2019re totally right. Josie should have balanced her time better while working to support herself as an orphaned teenager with no stable guardians.\n\nOfc YTA\n\nIt\u2019s sad that you will go to the wall to defend Olivia\u2019s hard work getting into a top school but you don\u2019t recognize that Josie put in just as much work to get herself through high school and into a community college.  The work she was doing was different and it\u2019s not work that is valued when it comes to securing a place in higher education but it wasn\u2019t less.  Where\u2019s your pride in her?\n\nTruthfully, both of these women sound like they\u2019re too good for you.", "YTA. What a horrible thing to say. No one was attacking your precious ex who you are clearly still hung up on. Josie was speaking socio-economic facts (check out some scientific studies that have actually been done about this stuff). The fact Josie has been so disciplined in both going to work and still going to school (throughout high school and now college) and not falling victim to the circumstances surrounding her that she had zero control over shows that she has more self-worth, tenacity, and strength in her tiny finger than many, many people in this world. She\u2019s going to be a massive success at whatever she chooses to do. You are not good enough for her.", "YTA... You praised your ex and disparaged your current gf all in one sentence!", "YTA and you're not finished with Olivia, so you're putting Josie into the 'bad guy' role, so you can defend Olivia.  Maybe Josie is jealous of Olivia, but that tends to happen when your significant other realizes you're not over your ex.", "Yta, you may be 100% right that Olivia deserves to get in but to flip that on Josie was shallow. You know the situation is different between the two and yta because you made it out to be she could have done it too if she tried harder.\n\nThat was a low blow.", "YTA, Josie is 100% right in her assessment here. Sure maybe she\u2019s a little jealous but this whole thing reads like you aren\u2019t over your ex.", "Yta.", "YTA. Do tell how does one better balance poverty with you know life that\u2019s expensive? Way to invalidate what she\u2019s saying. Also she\u2019s right in what she is saying. Those in stable economic backgrounds do have more advantages. You owe her an apology.", "Josie needs to dump you. YTA", "YTA, she didn\u2019t actually insult Olivia she was telling the truth.\n\nAlso no one is ever going to be okay with you still being close with someone you had a 2 year relationship, especially when you white knight this hard for them when they weren\u2019t even mentioned. It\u2019s a hell of a lot of history and to jump to her defence like that over your gf telling the truth shows you still have deep feelings for Olivia that override/blind you to your gfs feelings. I don\u2019t think the break up between you was mutual and you still have a way to go to get over her.", "YTA. You\u2019re a huge asshole. You didn\u2019t just defend your ex. You put down Josie who had to work to survive. She was absolutely right and if she has any sense will find someone better than you", "YTA, and Josie is fucking right. Children with affluent families typically are given better opportunities than those who\u2019re poor. Does that mean Oliva didn\u2019t work hard? No, but Josie pointing out that her background set her up for an easier time is both correct and not even a rude comment. \n\nYou need to get over your ex or let Josie go so she can find someone who isn\u2019t weirdly attached to an ex", "YTA. Not for what you said about Olivia's accomplishments,  but the way you dismissed what your GF said. What she said was 100% accurate.  It certainly IS a lot easier to do extracurricular activities when your parents have time and money. It's easier when you don't have to work part time to help your family or buy your own clothes and food. It's ignorant and ridiculous to think otherwise.", "YTA. \n\nA) Josie was correct, she's literally just stating facts. There's a reason it's mostly wealthy students at those schools and it's not because they're inherently better than poor kids. Privileged people absolutely hate recognizing this because it undermines their meritocracy myth \n\nB) most people aren't ok with people being close friends with their exes like that. \n\nC) of course she's jealous. Who isn't jealous of someone who has a privileged life and plenty of opportunities? Imagine eating in front of a starving person and being like \"you're just jealous\". Like, no shit? \n\nD) YOU mentioned your ex. She didn't. So you brought her up and then you accuse her of being insecure about your relationship with your ex, which is still weird.", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s jealous. Anybody is going to be jealous of their current bf being so close with their ex who you apparently see as incredible for getting into a good school. But you don\u2019t have to tell her she\u2019s sad and needs to get it together. You need to hype her up especially with her circumstances growing up.", "At first I was on the fence but what Josie said is not wrong and you are part of the problem and unaware of your privilege.

Can see why Olivia dropped you.", "YTA - Josie is a survivor! Anyone would be incredibly proud of what she has overcome. You seem like a privileged jerk OP. Congratulations to Olivia for getting into a great school but she didn\u2019t have to overcome being orphaned in poverty and working to take care of herself before graduating high school.", "YTA and you completely missed your girlfriends point. She wasn\u2019t even taking anything away from Olivia, she was (correctly) pointing out how difficult it is for people who don\u2019t have the same level of support that Olivia did.", "YTA\n\nwhy do you deny privilege exist?\n\nThe remark about a poor kid just needing to work harder proves you don't believe.\n\nJosie is insecure....but I don't think she's the one with the problem.", "YTA - she\u2019s not wrong and you\u2019re still defending your ex!", "YTA. Josie wasn't wrong and you sound like you prefer your ex to her.", "Socio-economic compatibility is something you seem to share with Olivia but not Josie so it is natural for you to side with Olivia.

Josie has a traumatic past and worked stupid hard to get to where she is. And she's absolutely right in that people who have socioemotional and financial privilege are better able to \"balance their time\" since they dont have to worry about... oh I don't know... eating or having electricity. People who come from privilege like Olivia have access to extracurriculars, educational opportunities, test prep, hobbies, that people like Josie may not even know about let alone have access to since they're busy trying to have basic survival needs.\n\nYou have a gf who has surpassed most odds to not just survive her childhood but is in college. You should be darn proud of her. Not telling her she could be like your privileged ex if she'd just balanced her time. Oh and throwing in that you ARE proud of Olivia as some extra salt in that wound.\n\nYou've shown considerable ignorance of privilege and told your gf she isn't as good as your ex while demonstrating complete lack of understanding of her traumatic background and struggles.  Perhaps you should take classes at the local CC to learn about privilege. It doesn't even have to be a top 20 school.", "YTA. Sure, she does sound a little jealous and a bit like she wants to bring Josie down a peg, but she's also right that getting into elite colleges is often seen as only attainable for the privileged. There are always a handful of less well-resourced students that get in, but those stories are so rare comparatively. \n\nIf she is jealous of Olivia, that is something to treat with compassion. I know it was getting old for you, but you turned it into a personal attack against your girlfriend, and that's pretty shitty.", "YTA this is the last thing Josie needs. She is also right!

She's the only children so a lot of attention was placed on her. \n\nJosie grew up in poverty and both her parents ODed when she super younger. her brother was her main guardian but a lot of her teen years was working so she could survive for herself. \n\nJosie admits she gets jealous when Olivia talks about her life, or when I start worrying about Olivia's mental health.\n\nJosie and her friend was discussing colleges. Olivia goes to one of the top 20 schools, while Josie goes to a CC. I proud of Olivia for getting in. Well Josie and her friend started talking about the kids who get in because their parents usually have a lot of money. I got the sense Josie was talking about Olivia.\n\nShe said she wasn't, but realistically students like Olivia have more opputurnities and resources that will help get admitted, compared to kids like herself, who are either working or at school. \n\nI told her Olivia worked really hard to get into that school.\n\nJosie said she knows that, she's just saying it's easier to do extracurricular and volunteer hours when you don't have to worry about how you're going to afford groceries.  \n\nI told her she was just jealous of Olivia again and it's getting really sad at this point. The admission team clearly saw something in her, that got her accepted beyond her social class, and maybe if Josie had balanced her time better she could have made it in a school like that.\n\nJosie left in tears with her friends.

Olivia\u2019s parents are both around and have high paying jobs.", "The ex is very rich the current girlfriend is the orphan", "You know he's still in love with ex just by the way he talks about her and his current. You can tell who he prefers...", "This. In my comment I suggested he back off from Olivia to an extent, but these issues are what I meant. The two women do not have to like each other. Don\u2019t bring Josie around her and limit talking about her. Yeah, OP is definitely TA.", "Oddly protective. Reading this all I could think was \"okay so ur still in love with Olivia\"", "He can't get back with her... \nMutual breakup means she dumped him. \nStill friends means he's still stalking her.", "Oops! You\u2019re right. Edited.", "I\u2019m going to guess it wasn\u2019t as mutual as he claims.", "Exactly\u2026nothing really has to do with one being his ex and the other his gf. He\u2019s just an AH to his gf.", "Defending someone else's achievements is not particularly assholish.", "I didn't say they have the exact same chances or anything of the sort. But talking down about someone or deminishing their achievements because you didn't have the exact same one is a crappy thing to do.", "ah, my apologies! I was reading on my phone. Okay, I understand now. \n\nI'm still voting NTA. Having had v jealous exes before, I learned it's best to be thoughtful but not indulge it. Otherwise, it gets fed. \n\nWhen it comes to who had more or less, a friend once told me, after I got mad at someone else's (in my opinion, unjustified) success, that one should not look at another's plate to see if they have more, but only ever check to see if they have less (so that you might help them if they do). \n\nYou're not an asshole for standing up for someone you once cared about.", "yes, I understand now. I read it wrong and was too kind", "... but she didn't attack olivia? He made it about olivia. And that it is easier to learn and volunteer when you don't have to work is simply true.\n\n\nYou can't just made up something and then use that as justification to insult and humiliate someone", "She didn't make it about Olivia. He just assumed she talked about it. Thousands of kids are like Olivia. Hell, I was like Olivia. I had two working parents and we were comfortable middle class. Never had to worry about not having food on the table. I got the opportunities to do extra circulars. I got a job to get some independence and responsibility in high school, not because I actually needed to survive. My parents had been saving money for me since I was born and because of financial aid because of what my dad did for a living, I didn't have to pay for undergrad and that money saved was used for grad school. I'm debt free. \n\nJosie and thousand of other kids don't have that. They can absolutely rise above it and be successful, but privilege is very much a thing.", "She didn't put olivia down at all. He made it about olivia. \n\n\n\"I didn't say they have the excat same chances.\" Lol ypu clown. Seriously. You said her parents money played no part. \n\n\nIt is a fact that ivy uni take in legacy students and that a lot of the students come of above average income households. Facts.\n\n\nDo the math on how many hours olivia had to put in to get in and then try to ad just 10 hours of work while still sleeping at night. (While ops gf probably worked more hours as 10 a week).", "Then he\u2019s an asshole for saying his gf just wasn\u2019t working hard enough to get where Olivia is", "No I didn't. I said that her parents having money isn't a shoe in and it's not. She still had to work hard. You sound as bad as Josie.", "Fair point. You're right. I concede the argument.", "I had parents who supported me and while not living in the us- I have a good degree and earn good money. I'm just seeing the world like it is and am grateful for the opportunities my parents made possible for me and not act like I could have somehow done same while not being supported.", "Both women have had to work hard to get where they are now, the difference is that the work Josie had to do isn\u2019t the kind that admissions departments at Ivy league schools care about.\n\nJosie wasn\u2019t talking down about Olivia, she was acknowledging the realities of the current system."]}
