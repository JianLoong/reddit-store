The break up was mutual and we stayed close friends. My girlfriend now, Josie, isn't a huge fan of me being friends with Olivia but is working towards accepting it with her therapist\n\nThe big thing is both of them come from different backgrounds. Olivia's mom is a NP and her dad's a lawyer, so financially her life has been good. She's the only children so a lot of attention was placed on her. \n\nJosie grew up in poverty and both her parents ODed when she super younger. her brother was her main guardian but a lot of her teen years was working so she could survive for herself. \n\nJosie admits she gets jealous when Olivia talks about her life, or when I start worrying about Olivia's mental health.\n\nJosie and her friend was discussing colleges. Olivia goes to one of the top 20 schools, while Josie goes to a CC. I proud of Olivia for getting in. Well Josie and her friend started talking about the kids who get in because their parents usually have a lot of money. I got the sense Josie was talking about Olivia.\n\nShe said she wasn't, but realistically students like Olivia have more opputurnities and resources that will help get admitted, compared to kids like herself, who are either working or at school. \n\nI told her Olivia worked really hard to get into that school.\n\nJosie said she knows that, she's just saying it's easier to do extracurricular and volunteer hours when you don't have to worry about how you're going to afford groceries.  \n\nI told her she was just jealous of Olivia again and it's getting really sad at this point. The admission team clearly saw something in her, that got her accepted beyond her social class, and maybe if Josie had balanced her time better she could have made it in a school like that.\n\nJosie left in tears with her friends.

She also wasn't directly talking about Olivia. \n\nI wonder how often you bring up Olivia to your gf. The fact that she has to be in therapy to be okay with it makes me wonder if Josie isn't the issue at all.", "YTA\n\nDefending your ex's achievements, that's fair.\n\nLashing out at your current girlfriend to defend your ex (who she hadn't insulted directly) by accusing her of being jealous and BLAMING her for not \"balancing\" her time while she had to support herself AS AN ORPHAN? Seriously? Yes her older brother took care of her but she had no parents, i.e. an orphan. So yes, you blamed an orphan for not managing their time better AS A TEENAGER while WORKING TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are TOTALLY the AH.  She deserves better than to be treated like this.  And you should TOTALLY express to your GF that you are proud for her going to CC.  Considering her background that is an achievement worthy of praise. She is not letting her circumstances keep her down and is just as admirable as getting into a \"good\" college.", "YTA. Josie was making a fair point about how admissions policies at top schools tend to favour wealthy applicants. (Many even have explicit policies favouring the children of alumni, most of whom are wealthy). As someone who went to an Ivy, I can assure you that what she's saying is very much true.\n\nHer point was fair. She didn't mention Olivia at all. You were the one who brought that up, and then decided to add a completely gratuitous insult to your girlfriend, who's done a great job coping in very difficult circumstances. I hope she dumps you.", "YTA. Josie is 100% correct. It is way easier to succeed when all of your basic needs are met, and even easier when they are exceeded.", "Wow, YTA. Josie busted her ass just to have food on the table, it does not compare at all to Olivia who studied hard. For Josie it was either extra curriculars or food. You are the asshole for even comparing them and not being insanely proud of Josie like every other person would be.", "YTA\n\nJosie is right. Even the most talented, hardworking student experiences poverty as a real barrier to opportunity. She didn't mention Olivia - you did - and then you completely dismissed Josie's experiences, insulted her and made her cry.\n\nMaybe time to be honest and admit you are not over Olivia, and it's causing problems for your relationship with Josie because *of course it is*.", "YTA. Ignoring the benefits of financial privilege to higher education is gross.", "YTA\n\nShe was right. She wasn\u2019t dissing Olivia - she even agreed that she worked hard to get in. She was just pointing out actual real-life differences in opportunity. Statistically supported real-life differences.\n\nYou owe her an apology.\n\n\u201cMaybe if Josie had balanced her time better she could have made it in a school like that.\u201d\n\nScrap that. No apology can save you from that statement. She deserves better.", "YTA. Really?  This is the hill you die on?  Being a cheerleader and champion for your ex when your current girlfriend is absolutely right.

You are right that to get into a top school, you have to put in serious effort that goes beyond just doing ok in school.  So Olivia did earn her way into a top school.  However, you took it too far and let it get personal, then attacked your girlfriend for her position.  You need to apologize and hope she doesn\u2019t dump you.", "YTA, and just get back together with Olivia since she seems like your priority over your GIRLFRIEND", "YTA. this isn't about siding with your girlfriend or your ex, it's about you spouting blatantly classist rhetoric to a woman who grew up under extreme poverty. you didn't \"defend your ex's achievements,\" you insulted your girlfriend due to disparaging assumptions you made on account of your apparent contempt for her background, just because she made the **entirely accurate** statement that a lot of kids get into top colleges because they're rich.", "YTA. She was right.", "YTA. You're clearly aware of the socioeconomic differences that allowed your ex to do so well in college and prevented your current gf from having the same opportunities, but instead of acknowledging that in conversation, you belittled your current gf and claimed that she's responsible for the hardship she faced as a child. \n\nYou're a terrible partner to Josie, and I hope she dumps you. She deserves someone who respects the hard work she's putting in for herself and her future. That's clearly not you.", "YTA!\n\nit\u2019s fine to be friends with your ex and it\u2019s understandable that Josie is uncomfortable to a certain extent but is working on it. \n\nIm sure Olivia worked hard but she obviously had advantages to get into those schools that Josie did not. However, what you said to Josie was so unbelievably tone deaf and ignorant. Balance her time better? How would she do that if she is going to school and working afterwards? She HAD NO TIME for extracurriculars, volunteer work, \u2014all the things that help you get admitted into prestigious schools! It is MUCH EASIER to do those things if you have a financially stable home. She did not, she had to worry about putting food on the table and surviving\u2014there was no room for \u201cbalancing her time\u201d because her time was spent SURVIVING because she had no such support system to lean back on.\n\nIf you value this relationship at all, go and apologize to her for what you said. Her feelings are valid and what she said is TRUE, Olivia worked hard but it\u2019s easier to work that hard when you have the resources to do so.", "Wow, you sound like a shitty partner to be honest. Sure be friends with an ex, your girlfriend is uncomfortable about your ex and what do you do? Stand up for your ex? Yta\nAlso sounds like you prioritize your ex over your current partner which is even worse.", "Yeah. Straight up YTA and I'm surprised that's all she did when she left. Are you really going to tell a person whose parents died when they were a kid that they needed better time management skills? I don't even know what else to say to you, you're really gross. I hope you grow out of this.", "YTA. It's literally a fact that someone who comes from a financially comfortable background with two parents is going to have an easier time of things. To deny it is foolish when there's so much data out there supporting this fact. \n\nTo be constantly gushing over Olivia in front of Josie and then to essentially tell Josie she isn't good enough to get into a good school bc she didn't maintain good grades It's a shitty thing to do. Sounds like she had A LOT on her plate and really WOULDN'T have as much help or as much privilege as Olivia did. So, there really was no need to white knight for your ex like that by insulting your current girlfriend for simply pointing out OBVIOUS FACTS!", "Hopefully your girlfriend will dump you, since you obviously care more about your ex than her.", "I was recently reading some numbers. For Ivy League schools, the children of the 1% have a 15X greater than they should chance of acceotance and enrollement.  \n\n\nThe children of the bottom 20% had a 7 times smaller chance of enrollment than their percebtage shoud give them.  \n\n\nThe chikldren of the 1% have a 100 times better chance of acceptance and enrollment.  \n\n\nAnyone but a eugenecist would think you are the asshole.", "Just date olivia bro", "You seem to have no respect or empathy for Josie, so why are you with her? And do you really think somebody who had to work to support herself while she was a minor had the opportunity to participate in the same number of extracurricular activities that the only child of two wealthy people did? You sound very socially blind and privileged.\n\nDo Josie a favor and break up with her. It doesn\u2019t sound like you even like her. \n\nYTA.", "YTA.\n\nJosie was speaking the truth there. It's all backed up with statistics. Stop championing for your ex; she doesn't need you running block for her.", "YTA\n\nShe wasn't even talking about Olivia just about social classes and balance her life better excuse you ???\n\nShe lost both parents  and required a job to support herself ! That means as an orphan teenager she had two full time jobs ( the real full time job and school ) she still managed to graduate school, and get into college. And your u think she should have worked hard then that??\n\nOlivia had two parents working and didn't have to do any of that ... They ran the same race but Olivia started 12 miles ahead \n\nThe reality is your still in love with your ex and are wearing blinders", "YTA - only mentioning how hard Olivia worked is what gets me. You explained earlier how much your gf has overcome to be where she is today with no praise or anything at all, but praise for the ex and accolades for her. All the points about money making things easier are valid whether she was directly talking about your ex or not.", "Tell me where she was putting down your ex or speaking an untruth, I'll wait.\n\n\nJosie is 100% correct that people like Olivia have it easier and have a better chance to focus on things that top colleges look for in potential students, Josie wasn't speaking down on Olivia at all in truth she was pretty much speaking down about herself and her circumstances & you being the awesome (/s) boyfriend that you are helped kick her down even farther. \n\n\nYTA", "YTA. Are you sure it was a mutual break up? Cause you sure are white knighting hard for someone that doesn\u2019t need it. This post is just gushing about Olivia while Josie is just an afterthought. \n\nJosie has valid points it is easier for Olivia to get into college because of her privilege. Privilege is not inherently bad or good. It usually just is. What you do with that is another issue.", "YTA\n\nJosie is spot on when she talks about the ability of wealthy families to do all the extra tuition and extracurricular activities needed to place their children at prestigious universities. That\u2019s not even talking about the peace of mind for the student at not having to work to pay tuition. \n\nNo matter how hard Olivia did or did not work, Josie is absolutely right.\n\nYou owe her an apology.", "YTA\n\n\nYou are ignorant and arrogant. It is actually sad how your gf lets you put her down while being in love with you.\n\n\n- you made it about olivia\n\n\n- it is a fact that getting in AND affording an ivy university is far easier if your parents support you fincially. You can't \"manage away\" working hours. Just do the fucking math. \n\n\n- you humiliated your gf you are supposed to love. Even if we forget that you made it about olivia, even if we forget that she talked facts and lets even assume your were right for a second (wich you arent), to pull such a stunt out of no where... i would break up with you.", "YTA.  It's ok to be friends with your ex but sheesh, stop rubbing your gf's face in it.  You don't need to talk to your gf about her. And if your girlfriend brings her up youcam deflect, or at least engage in conversation that is respectful and compassionate to BOTH of them.", "1. I can see that Josie has her insecurities but in this case, she wasn't directly addressing Olivia, right? I mean unless she specifically used Olivia's name or details in that conversation, you cannot accuse her of doing that. \n\n2. So I am going with YTA because you openly disparaged your current GF just because you \"got the sense\" that she was attacking your Ex. That was a bad move if you ask me.", "YTA - \u201cmaybe if you didn\u2019t work and basically become independent at a young age to help your brother provide for you and himself you could\u2019ve gotten where she got.\u201d\n\nDude, you kinda threw her upbringing into her face for making valid points with friends. They didn\u2019t outright said Olivia but she does fall into that camp and yeah, Olivia had far more options that your girlfriend because of the money her family had. \n\nAnd to bring up that she\u2019s jealous of Olivia in front of friends when that\u2019s something that you could\u2019ve brought up in private (even though you\u2019d still be an ass based on this situation) was just mean.

Life is so much easier when you have the opportunity", "YTA for the part where you said \u201cmaybe if you balanced your time better\u201d after you said she didn\u2019t have parents and worked to survive for herself. I think you need to check your own privilege. Are you proud of Josie for working through her whole life and making community college work? That\u2019s no small feat. Maybe if you built her up instead of tearing her down she wouldn\u2019t have to be jealous of Olivia.", "YTA dude. She has every right to feel her feelings about wealthier people having it easier than her. And she's right, they do. Instead, you made it about your ex, invalidated your gf, and, ugh, told her \"maybe if you worked harder...\" and \"you're just jealous...\"  You're pissed that she's got jealousy toward your ex, yet here you are deliberately comparing the two of them, and telling her why your ex is better than she is.\n\nWhy didn't you just listen to her? Honestly it sounds like you don't even like her. Fuck bro.", "YTA. You're the one who brought up Olivia and then kept bringing up Olivia. You obviously are way too focused on Olivia to actually date anyone else.", "YTA.\n\nYou're not over your ex and Josie doesn't want to hear about her.", "YTA\n\n\u201cBalanced her time better\u201d between what, food and a roof over her head instead of debate club and band practice?\n\nAre you as spoiled as Olivia?", "YTA. The point she made saying that Olivia surely did work hard, but that doesn't mean she didn't inherently have advantages is literally true, it's class/wealth privilege. Being privileged doesn't mean that person isn't a hard worker, but you just had to take offense anyway. And on top of that, you doubled down and insulted your g/f by saying she just should have balanced her time better. Ugh. Very much YTA 100%", "YTA she didnt say anything about Oliva and what she said is true. She had to work to eat, she had to pick studing or food on the table and you know that. Olivia had a lot of opportunities because she didnt have to worry and Yes it was also because of her hard work and that they did see something in her. This is an example cause life is unfair. I know if Josie had the same opportunities as Olivia she could have also goten in a top school. She didnt say that Olivia got in cause she has money or said anything like that! She is saying how she didnt get in because she didnt and how people who have money can get good classes they need and a lot more. \nETA: Last part meant it in the wrong way sorry", "YTA. She was making very valid points about access to education, money, and influence. It wasn't a personal attack against your rich ex that you're still into.\n\nDo you even like your gf?", "\"I told her she was just jealous of Olivia again and it's getting really sad at this point.

You were completely out of line. Apologize, and maybe back off from Olivia for a while to work things out here - if Josie is even willing!\nBut again, speaking as someone from a privileged background myself - YTA.", "YTA Josie is right", "YTA. That wasnt defending your ex. That was fully just insulting your gf.", "LMAO. YTA. Why don\u2019t you go back to St Olivia? Clearly you can\u2019t handle someone speaking truth about Olivia\u2019s privilege and how it helped her.", "YTA\n\nYes, Josie is probably a little jealous - that would be natural.\n\nIn the other hand, one\u2019s background does matter.  Race, gender, sexuality, wealth, physical and mental abilities, etc all matter in who has a head start and who faces challenges.\n\nIt is easier for the kids from richer families to get into better colleges and universities.  These kids, like Olivia were granted a head start and can fly on the tailwinds of their parents.  They can typically concentrate on their studies and do extracurricular activities (which is what colleges and universities look at).  If teens, like your girlfriend, need to work or help out at home because of financial issues, they are less likely to graduation hs, never-mind make it into and afford college or university.  The fact your gf goes to cc, is in my opinion, fantastic.  She was able to beat greater challenges that Olivia never had to face to complete hs and go on to higher education.\n\nEdit spelling", "Josie has no parents,  comes from poverty and had to work to survive. \n\nThe ex had a stable upbringing and parents who could provide nicely for her. She could focus on her studies. \n\n\nShe was speaking the truth about how it's easier to focus on school, volunteering and extra activities when you don't have to work to survive. \n\nThese are facts. She didn't say ex didn't work hard or didn't deserve to be in the school she was in. \n\nConsidering where Josie is coming from, it's pretty incredible that she is taking care of herself - mentally and physically  - and is in college. \n\nAnd yet, you down played her accomplishments by saying she was just jealous of your ex and she needed better time management skills!?!?!. \n\nYTA and I'd be shocked if you still have a girlfriend.", "YTA - you seem to emphasize with your ex, but not your girlfriend. Wonder why?", "YTA\n\nYou're very dismissive of your gf and didn't say a single positive thing about her. You're clearly still in love with your ex.", "YTA, what the heck? Not only were Josie and her friends correct, they were also speaking generally.\n\nIt's kinda weird you went out of your way to defend Olivia when no one was attacking her.", "No, you\u2019re totally right. Josie should have balanced her time better while working to support herself as an orphaned teenager with no stable guardians.\n\nOfc YTA\n\nIt\u2019s sad that you will go to the wall to defend Olivia\u2019s hard work getting into a top school but you don\u2019t recognize that Josie put in just as much work to get herself through high school and into a community college.  The work she was doing was different and it\u2019s not work that is valued when it comes to securing a place in higher education but it wasn\u2019t less.  Where\u2019s your pride in her?\n\nTruthfully, both of these women sound like they\u2019re too good for you.", "YTA. What a horrible thing to say. No one was attacking your precious ex who you are clearly still hung up on. Josie was speaking socio-economic facts (check out some scientific studies that have actually been done about this stuff). The fact Josie has been so disciplined in both going to work and still going to school (throughout high school and now college) and not falling victim to the circumstances surrounding her that she had zero control over shows that she has more self-worth, tenacity, and strength in her tiny finger than many, many people in this world. She\u2019s going to be a massive success at whatever she chooses to do. You are not good enough for her.", "YTA... You praised your ex and disparaged your current gf all in one sentence!", "YTA and you're not finished with Olivia, so you're putting Josie into the 'bad guy' role, so you can defend Olivia.  Maybe Josie is jealous of Olivia, but that tends to happen when your significant other realizes you're not over your ex.", "Yta, you may be 100% right that Olivia deserves to get in but to flip that on Josie was shallow. You know the situation is different between the two and yta because you made it out to be she could have done it too if she tried harder.\n\nThat was a low blow.", "YTA, Josie is 100% right in her assessment here. Sure maybe she\u2019s a little jealous but this whole thing reads like you aren\u2019t over your ex.", "Yta.", "YTA. Do tell how does one better balance poverty with you know life that\u2019s expensive? Way to invalidate what she\u2019s saying. Also she\u2019s right in what she is saying.

It\u2019s a hell of a lot of history and to jump to her defence like that over your gf telling the truth shows you still have deep feelings for Olivia that override/blind you to your gfs feelings. I don\u2019t think the break up between you was mutual and you still have a way to go to get over her.", "YTA. You\u2019re a huge asshole. You didn\u2019t just defend your ex. You put down Josie who had to work to survive. She was absolutely right and if she has any sense will find someone better than you", "YTA, and Josie is fucking right. Children with affluent families typically are given better opportunities than those who\u2019re poor. Does that mean Oliva didn\u2019t work hard? No, but Josie pointing out that her background set her up for an easier time is both correct and not even a rude comment. \n\nYou need to get over your ex or let Josie go so she can find someone who isn\u2019t weirdly attached to an ex", "YTA. Not for what you said about Olivia's accomplishments,  but the way you dismissed what your GF said. What she said was 100% accurate.  It certainly IS a lot easier to do extracurricular activities when your parents have time and money. It's easier when you don't have to work part time to help your family or buy your own clothes and food. It's ignorant and ridiculous to think otherwise.", "YTA. \n\nA) Josie was correct, she's literally just stating facts. There's a reason it's mostly wealthy students at those schools and it's not because they're inherently better than poor kids. Privileged people absolutely hate recognizing this because it undermines their meritocracy myth \n\nB) most people aren't ok with people being close friends with their exes like that. \n\nC) of course she's jealous. Who isn't jealous of someone who has a privileged life and plenty of opportunities? Imagine eating in front of a starving person and being like \"you're just jealous\". Like, no shit? \n\nD) YOU mentioned your ex. She didn't. So you brought her up and then you accuse her of being insecure about your relationship with your ex, which is still weird.", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s jealous. Anybody is going to be jealous of their current bf being so close with their ex who you apparently see as incredible for getting into a good school. But you don\u2019t have to tell her she\u2019s sad and needs to get it together. You need to hype her up especially with her circumstances growing up.", "At first I was on the fence but what Josie said is not wrong and you are part of the problem and unaware of your privilege.

She wasn\u2019t even taking anything away from Olivia, she was (correctly) pointing out how difficult it is for people who don\u2019t have the same level of support that Olivia did.", "YTA\n\nwhy do you deny privilege exist?\n\nThe remark about a poor kid just needing to work harder proves you don't believe.\n\nJosie is insecure....but I don't think she's the one with the problem.", "YTA - she\u2019s not wrong and you\u2019re still defending your ex!", "YTA. Josie wasn't wrong and you sound like you prefer your ex to her.", "Socio-economic compatibility is something you seem to share with Olivia but not Josie so it is natural for you to side with Olivia.

Josie has a traumatic past and worked stupid hard to get to where she is. And she's absolutely right in that people who have socioemotional and financial privilege are better able to \"balance their time\" since they dont have to worry about... oh I don't know... eating or having electricity. People who come from privilege like Olivia have access to extracurriculars, educational opportunities, test prep, hobbies, that people like Josie may not even know about let alone have access to since they're busy trying to have basic survival needs.\n\nYou have a gf who has surpassed most odds to not just survive her childhood but is in college. You should be darn proud of her. Not telling her she could be like your privileged ex if she'd just balanced her time. Oh and throwing in that you ARE proud of Olivia as some extra salt in that wound.\n\nYou've shown considerable ignorance of privilege and told your gf she isn't as good as your ex while demonstrating complete lack of understanding of her traumatic background and struggles.  Perhaps you should take classes at the local CC to learn about privilege. It doesn't even have to be a top 20 school.", "YTA. Sure, she does sound a little jealous and a bit like she wants to bring Josie down a peg, but she's also right that getting into elite colleges is often seen as only attainable for the privileged. There are always a handful of less well-resourced students that get in, but those stories are so rare comparatively. \n\nIf she is jealous of Olivia, that is something to treat with compassion.

She's the only children so a lot of attention was placed on her. \n\nJosie grew up in poverty and both her parents ODed when she super younger. her brother was her main guardian but a lot of her teen years was working so she could survive for herself. \n\nJosie admits she gets jealous when Olivia talks about her life, or when I start worrying about Olivia's mental health.\n\nJosie and her friend was discussing colleges. Olivia goes to one of the top 20 schools, while Josie goes to a CC. I proud of Olivia for getting in. Well Josie and her friend started talking about the kids who get in because their parents usually have a lot of money. I got the sense Josie was talking about Olivia.\n\nShe said she wasn't, but realistically students like Olivia have more opputurnities and resources that will help get admitted, compared to kids like herself, who are either working or at school. \n\nI told her Olivia worked really hard to get into that school.\n\nJosie said she knows that, she's just saying it's easier to do extracurricular and volunteer hours when you don't have to worry about how you're going to afford groceries.  \n\nI told her she was just jealous of Olivia again and it's getting really sad at this point. The admission team clearly saw something in her, that got her accepted beyond her social class, and maybe if Josie had balanced her time better she could have made it in a school like that.\n\nJosie left in tears with her friends.

Is wealth alone enough to get into a great school? No. Is it correct that kids from low income families tend to have more responsibilities that interfere with their studying and extracurricular activities? Absolutely. And they also are more likely to have part time jobs that they can't quit even if it affects their grades. And they're more likely to suffer mental health complications. And they're less likely to have family friends who can recommend and advocate for them.

Throw me some letters and I'm cool -- I fucking love algebra -- but ask me to just add or subtract numbers and I struggle. \n\nI'm not saying that Josie shouldn't be proud to be in a CC. I know I was. But it's absolutely not on the same level as a Top 20 school when it comes to admission standards. There's a *reason* a lot of lower class college students start at CC's. It helps them save money because they get the first 2 years of college at a much lower price and it helps them get caught up on academic skills that they may have missed out on because *they were a teenager trying to keep food on the table*.", "YTA based on that last paragraph! everything up to that seemed fine\n\n\u201cshe's just saying it's easier to do extracurricular and volunteer hours when you don't have to worry about how you're going to afford groceries.\u201d Josie has a point! and if you read it again, you\u2019ll note that it is not a criticism of Olivia and you or she shouldn\u2019t take it personally.

Olivia may have worked hard, but you can't pretend for a second that her social class didn't contribute to her acceptance. Her family money may not have been a deciding factor to the administration, but as Josie said, the opportunities, extracurriculars, etc. that Olivia had, were made possible due to her financial state. So yes, even if it's indirectly, her social class played a part.", "Extremely toxic that all these commenters think that OP praising Olivia means that OP doesn\u2019t appreciate his GF\u2019s achievements.

Of course OP\u2019s gf envies the life that wealthier people had. I\u2019d only put soft YTA to OP for calling her jealous because that lacks tact but he\u2019s not wrong.

However, what\u2019s the point of still being in contact with your ex? Sure you guys might\u2019ve ended things on good terms but it\u2019s over. There really shouldn\u2019t even be a reason to check on her if you have a new girl. Just curious, are you close with other exes? If you are, then she\u2019ll just have to work on not being jealous if she wants to be with you. If it\u2019s just Olivia, then I\u2019d say you\u2019re kinda added fuel to the fire. Your choice at the end of the day, but if you want to be with Josie, then be with Josie.", "NTA. Your girlfriend wants a pity party. However, drop the ex of you want to continue in this relationship. Your ex will always be a sore spot in this relationship.", "You're both wrong. You shouldn't be friends with your ex, you shouldn't be defending her so hard and your current gf is super jealous and constantly throwing shade.", "I want to put this here because not only do I agree,I want OP to understand something. \n\nIF you're in the states, which I admittedly think you are. Josie is right,with a privileged life,comes privilege. Olivia likely went to a top public school system,a STEM HS,or more likely a private school,any of these are already a leg up. Olivia likely had time to volunteer,get great  recommendations(maybe even from those who went to said college/university) or from people she volunteered with - which goes further than a teacher from a not very great school, plus had time for extracurriculars. THESE ARE PRIVILEGES THAT COME WITH HAVING MONEY. Sure, Olivia had to work hard,BUT she had privilege that Josie simply didn't and doesn't have. Having more privilege also means (usually) healthier foods and (usually) better sleep,and general well being,this goes beyond what school they each went to. \n\nLet's look at it like this, adding a few more people. Olivia, Lilly, Jade,and Josie are going to race, they're all the same speed and all start at the starting line,in the beginning.

That's a common boundary that a lot of people would have, ESPECIALLY with how much you seem to still be in love with her.", "YTA\n\nNo wonder your current girlfriend isn\u2019t a fan of you still being friends with your ex. From what I\u2019ve read, it seems like you think your ex is better than your current girlfriend just because of her social class. Your girlfriend literally did not mention Olivia at all, it was you who brought her up, weirdo.\n\nAnd your girlfriend is right, maybe not about Olivia but she\u2019s right that wealthy kids do have a better chance to get into better schools. I go to an Ivy League and I had to work 4 jobs all throughout high school to afford it and it still wasn\u2019t enough. My peers bought their way in. \n\nYour girlfriend has the right to be frustrated at that.\n\nYTA, I hope your girlfriend breaks up with you", "So how do you suggest she balance her time, choosing to buy food tomorrow instead of today?\n\nAre you serious? Do you know how hard it is to have to worry about whether you can afford to buy food, clothes, or even put a roof over your head?\n\nEven having to study to maybe one day get out of this situation. To have a clueless boyfriend comparing a person who lives in comfort as if he were an amazing person for having done no more than the obligation to study since he won everything else in hand.\n\nI sincerely hope Josie realizes that she deserves much more than you.\n\nYTA", "Yta....all of these comments and more.", "Yta....and your privilage is showing. People with money absolutely have an advantage when getting into a good college. Your gf is right, it is harder to study, do extra curriculars that top colleges want, plus all the other stuff top colleges want on your application when you're poor, an orphan, are dealing with severe trauma, and have to work constantly to make sure you freaking eat. You've obviously never been so poor you didn't know if you were going to eat the next day, have power or a home the next week, transportation, CLOTHES OR SHOES THAT FIT! All that stress and worry (on top of being an orphan) doesn't leave much time for balancing your time.", "YTA, all your gf did was make a completely valid point about how wealth and privilege comes with opportunities, which everyone knows to be true, and you attacked her personally for not doing better when circumstances were stacked against her. Of you seriously believe an orphan who has to work to eat can just 'manage their time' better and that will be enough to level the playing field you are seriously naive.", "Yta and you are delusional if you can't see that what she was saying was true. Why were you so triggered by it? \n\nCan you really not comprehend how disadvantaged your gf(I don't she should stay your gf btw) is? The fact that she is attending college is a miracle and testament to her hard work. \n\nShe never put your ex down. But you did put you gf down. \n\nThis is coming from someone who had a lot of opportunities because I had time for extra curriculars and if I had wanted more time to study more or help I would have had that too", "YTA As someone who came from poverty, it's incomparable how much harder it was to get where I am today vs someone incredibly privileged. Your gf is spot on with what she said.\n\n>She said she wasn't, but realistically students like Olivia have more opputurnities and resources that will help get admitted, compared to kids like herself, who are either working or at school. \n\nSomeone tells me you like bringing up your ex to your gf a lot. Josie deserves an apology and for you to stop pulling Olivia into your conversations.", "Not only YTA, you are disturbingly obsessed with defending your ex, to the point you're willing to offend your current GF.\n\nJosie is right to \"not be a huge fan\" of this relationship with Olivia. I mean, you'd rather make Josie cry by being blatantly disgusting and gaslighting towards her than for her to say anything that could ambiguously refer to Olivia and possibly put her in bad light (even if it's 100% facts, like the cycle of poverty and class-based educational opportunities)", "You\u2019re clearly not over your ex. I hope Josie leaves you. She deserves better; someone who has her back. YTA.", "YTA. I'm Olivia here - my parents were successful professionals, I had a privileged upbringing, stable home life and went to an Ivy League school - and I can admit the raging amount of privilege that that entails. I worked very very hard to get there, crediting it SOLELY to hard work ignores the fact that I already had a leg up - I didn't have to work to afford college, could pay for expensive extracurriculars and private tutors, didn't have to worry about scholarships, etc. My background was an accident of birth - my work was my own, but privilege contributed.   \n\n\nYou don't seem to get that and are CLEARLY comparing everything Josie does to the perfect Olivia. If your GF were saying truly unfair and awful things about Olivia you could refute them but you sound like you talk about Olivia a LOT more than is healthy for an ex and she's probably sick of it. And everything she said about how Olivia had advantages she didn't have IS TRUE. That doesn't mean Olivia wasn't smart or didn't work hard - it's not a dig at Olivia, it's a dig about how you seem obsessed with your ex and a very valid observation on the nature of privilege. Maybe her assuming Olivia got in because of rich parents was a bit out of line, but maybe it's true - not all top schools are \"need blind\" (admissions is separate entirely from financial aid). And it's not as simple as \"Olivia's parents bought her way into college\" - it can be that Olivia did the work and got the grades BECAUSE she was able to focus all her energies on academics and extracurrics and all the things that made her a competitive candidate because she didn't have to worry about putting food on the table or working part time or parenting her siblings. She may have had access to private schools and tutors that Josie didn't have. She likely had parents who went to college and could help her navigate admissions and go on college visits in a way that HAVING NO PARENTS doesn't come with.  \n\n\nLemme guess... Olivia dumped your ass? DO NOT MEASURE YOUR GFS AGAINST AN IDEALIZED OLIVIA TEMPLATE. And do not ever use the phrase \"beyond her social class\" ever again. Josie sounds like a much more mature person than you do, OP.", "Where men get the audacity? Jesus I hope your GF breaks up with you. You are a huge asshole", "I\u2019m saying NTA so you feel vindicated. Continue your behaviors so Josie leaves your sorry ass.", "YTA\n\nDude, are you dense or what? You are still far too close to your ex to the point that it\u2019s sickening that you subjected an innocent girl into putting up with your BS as she\u2019s now dating you. And the fact that she\u2019s going tO THERAPY to accept what IS NOT OKAY AT ALL!! The amount of gaslighting she must be experiencing you jabbering about your damn ex and how involved she still is with you. Clearly you are not over your ex and if you were, you would understand that she is NO LONGER the focus of your life and you are overstepping boundaries with your girlfriend. SHE DESERVES BETTER!!! A man who actually can move on from his exes like a normal human being and treat her with respect. You\u2019re a pig.", "YTA. You honestly suck. Why are you so hung up on ex? You have a gf that dragged herself out of poverty, was orphaned young, and managed to make it to college without starving and you go and keep giving praise to ex? Why is your gf even with you?", "YTA Josie isn't jealous, she's traumatized. You could do with a good long look in the mirror. You are not the man you think you are.", "You reek of privilege. Balanced her time better... sounds like she did great considering the uphill battle dealt to her by life. Olivia has worked hard but doesn't sound like she had to overcome any challenges even approaching what Josie overcame. Hopefully Olivia will take you back and Josie won't. YTA.", "YTA. Why is it so hard for you to understand that while your ex is qualified, she is also luckier than most? Are you really saying nothing in your ex's life would change if she had been orphaned at a young age? You really think she would be in exactly the same position without supportive parents and lots of resources?", "YTA.", "YTA - why are you prioritizing your ex over your girlfriend??", "My god. The OP here is TA but so are many of the people comenting here. \n\nLets get something straight here:\n\nOlivia is not at fault nor to be blamed to be born in a priviliged family, nor is she deserving to be called what some people are calling her in this thread. So much envy and frustation by the haters here, get yourself a therapist guys, jesus christ. So many rich and spoiled kids do absolutely nothing but to leech their parents money, at leas this girl is making something with the oportunities presented to herself. \n\nOn a second hand, so many toxic and insecure people horrified for someone being friend with their EX. This is not highschool anymore, you can be friend with your ex if you are a grown up and able to talk things through. That mentality of \"your ex MUST BE YOUR ENEMY\" is so toxic that I feel sorry for many people here. \n\nJosie knows that Olivia is a dear friend of his BF, and still choses to belittle her? No amount of jealousy and envy allows you to do that. The OP WAS RIGHT IN DEFENDING HIS FRIEND, but was an absolute AH in the way he did it. 0 consideration for her actual GF and her situation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you ask me, everyone in that story is the AH but Olivia.", "YTA and you should do some research and reflection on privilege and how it impacts every facet of life. You went off on your girlfriend, who has overcome huge adversities to be where she is, for simply pointing out that people who grew up with a lot of privilege have an advantage when it comes to education. Honestly you sound manipulative, telling someone that has struggled that she should've just tried harder, jumping to your ex's defence by attacking your girlfriend, and then making her think her feelings about you being friends with your ex are wrong and she needs to go to therapy for them when it's clear that she's right to have concerns. Hopefully she realises she deserves better and leaves you, you dick.", "Why are you friends with your ex? And ex is an ex as in out of your life. I will never understand that. For just that fact alone, YTA.", "Dude an asshole.. Period\nEveryone see through you.\n\nYta", "YTA You fail to see the truth in her words because you want to. It is TRUE that money gives you more time and opportunities for extra curricular activities and volunteer opportunities. Do you really think GF had the time and money to do these things while working to just survive? Wow, thats some first class ignorance right there. Your ex had the means to do those things, your GF did not. I hope GF breakes up with you so you can go back to the ex that you obviously still have a thing for.", "I don't even know why you need to mention your ex-GF when your current GF wasn't even mentioning her name and was speaking in a general sense about rich kids with more opportunities. Sure she could be jealous because your GF grew up with less privilege but you don't need to defend Olivia when her name isn't even mentioned. Like who are you trying to impress? You are an AH because you created conflict when there isn't any. Your GF and her friends has the right to vent about general richer and more privilege kids has more opportunities because you as well knew that for a fact. Doesn't even matter if the more privilege kids works hard because the paths of opportunities has been more easily accessible to them in general. Sad part you even knew this you mentioned it.", "YTA. \nI think you should go back to your ex if you're so proud of her.", "YTA\n\nWow. What you said was monstrous. Josie getting into community college is a far more impressive achievement than Olivia getting into an Ivy.\n\nConsidering what you know about Olivia's mental health issues, be honest--if she didn't have the rich parents and the super comfortable and easy home life with tons of support, one on one attention, and cheerleading through a roster of paid-for extras, and instead had Josie's family life...would she have accomplished even a quarter of Josie has? Or would she have spiralled into a drug addiction and a Walmart job?\n\nJosie deserves someone who isn't sycophantically still in love with his ex girlfriend.", "YTA. If Josie was my friend i\u2019d be telling her that she should get her priorities in order, have a conversation with you about why your behavior was unacceptable and if you didn\u2019t make an effort to improve, to break up with you.\n\nIt\u2019s ok to be friends with your ex. Its even ok to defend your ex if someone is harassing or belittling them, but to take a general, and very true, observation about the difficulty of accessing a college education for poor families versus rich families, and make it about your rich ex is tasteless & disrespectful to your gf", ">maybe if Josie had balanced her time better she could have made it in a school like that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n100% YTA. WTF? How can you balance your time when your basic needs aren't being met? How ignorant can you be?", "Wowww YTA\n\nJosie gave perfectly valid reasons and never even insulted Olivia. You projected all sorts of insecurities and jealousy onto her *yourself*.\n\nJosie is clearly not a priority to you, break up with her and let her be and she\u2019ll prosper and not have to go to freaking therapy because of you weirdly being close friends with your ex girlfriend.", "YTA and josie deserves better than a bf like you", "YTA.", "YTA I would dump your dumbass so fast lol", "YTA. Privileged people DO have it easier and even though she worked hard she didn\u2019t really need anyone to defend her.", "Holy shit dude, poor Josie...\n\n\nETA: giving your post I want to make it clear my comment is meant as sympathy for your girlfriend and not me joining you to bully Josie.", "Bootlick much? YTA.  Gotta love how you go out of your way to make sure the rich ex is being treated fairly and well thought of, but screw your pauper gf\u2019s valid concerns.  Proud of her get real, you\u2019re proud of what\u2019s in her purse.  Flash the dean some cash and the red carpet rolls out.  No cash?  Doors start to close.  Try not being so naive.", "Yta. \"if Josie had balanced her time better she could have made it in a school like that.' You mean balance the time between her studies & raising herself? Between worrying abt where her next meal will come from to worrying abt all the things most young girls can turn to their parents for?? That kind of balance? Funny you talk abt balance when the scale clearly tips in Olivia's favor. Is she jealous? Yes, absolutely. In her eyes Olivia was handed everything (not saying its true) & that Olivia has everything she wants, from parents, lifestyle to education. But one thing Jossie is correct on, it is easier to focus on the extra curriculum when you don't have to support yourself as a child.", "YTA \n\nJust break up with her.

You jumped her shit over something she didn\u2019t even say, you were hurtful and all do defend an ex.. so yeah it definitely seems like you still have some feelings.
