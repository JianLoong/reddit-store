Other people's unkind reactions have nothing to do with how well you behaved. There's no reason to suspect you would have found a seat on the platform, and passing out there would likely have delayed the trains anyway.", "NTA\n\nTruly repulsive behavior on the part of these commuters.

I also outwardly \"look\" like I am healthy but I have several chronic health conditions and invisible disabilities and need a seat. As someone who is from London, with an office based in London, I know too well what AHs many London commuters can be and have had similar experiences. I am so sorry this has happened to you, and can honestly say I am not surprised. Just some friendly advice from another disabled London commuter- if you go onto the TfL website you can order a blue \"please offer me a seat\" badge which warns other passengers that you need a seat. Whilst it isn't 100% effective as it relies on public goodwill... it has helped me enormously since getting it. It's free to order also.", "NTA.\n\nBut for future references, if you look fit, healthy and young you should start off by saying you have a heart condition that requires you to rest.

Just no. Those seats are made for disabled people. If a disabled person gets on the train and needs those seats, the non-disabled person in the seat needs to get up. Don't just blame it on her rushing. She deserves to get home on time.

You're disgusting, and those guys are disgusting.", "??? 1) she was rushing home so she WOULDN\u2019T have an episode and faint in public 2) what if the next train was packed too? should she just wait until an empty one shows up? 3) u say that OP \u201cexpect[ed] people to take [her] and [her] disability into account\u201d and so that makes her an asshole. a person with a disability expecting to be able to use a specially designated seat for ppl with disabilities is not an unrealistic/selfish/\u201casshole\u201d thing to do, and it\u2019s really fucking gross that u would say that.", "Hiya thank you for your comment! My question was more about whether or not I was at fault for causing the commotion, should I have waited for a different train or tried to explain myself better.

In any case, there would be no guarantee of a seat even if you did", "The badge hasn't been around for too many years, only like a year before covid. I hate to admit this but I used to wear a \"baby on board\" badge and fake pregnancy before that because it was the only way I was able to get a seat. I definitely recommend getting the badge. I also have the sunflower lanyard but that's mostly recognised by businesses rather than individuals in public so a combination of the lanyard and badge should help. \n\nI really wish TfL would do something about commuters without any impairments sitting on priority seats, and especially wearing headphones or falling asleep on those seats. I hate it how selfish people can be on TfL services. That's not to say everyone is- I have had some really lovely people over the years who have been helpful. I just wish TfL would invest in advertising on social media educating commuters on how to be courteous users.", "Im so sorry you\u2019ve been treated like this.
