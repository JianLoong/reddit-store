Not all disability is visible", "I have episodes where I get sluggish, am unable to form thoughts, greying out, but with some quick care it disappears quickly. Do not feel like this is your fault. It\u2019s a lesson for them to understand not all disabilities are visible. Unfortunately it was at the your expense and health but you did exactly right in asking for a seat", "Do they train service animals for your condition? Might be worth a look so you\u2019re not so nervous to go out alone. NTA and sorry you ended up on the Jerk Express.", "You are not under any social obligation to wait.", "Honest question\n\nYou shouldn't have to prove your disability, but what are you supposed to do if everyone else sitting down says they have disabilities?", "NAH. Clearly OP isn't an asshole.\nAs for the other guy, I'm not quite willing to call him an AH. Literally anyone can claim a disability whether they have one or not, just to get whatever small benefit like skipping a line or taking a seat from someone. Dude had no idea if OP was bullshitting or not. For instance, I'm a female with some extra belly fat. I could easily tell people I'm pregnant just so I can get to sit on a crowded bus.", "NTA - I\u2019m sorry you went through this, there seems to be a lot of entitled people who think that priority seating isn\u2019t something they need to follow for whatever reason (I\u2019ve experienced judgement both while pregnant and while using a stroller for my babies and it\u2019s beyond me). Just remember that you didn\u2019t do anything wrong here, the only AH\u2019s here are the two jerks who wouldn\u2019t give you a seat when you asked.", "NTA I have an invisible disability too and it really sucks when people don't believe you about it. This is not your fault! Able bodied people should give up seats reserved for the elderly/disabled when asked. Just as some possible advice, have you looked into getting a mobility aid like a rollator? Having a portable seat is so useful.", "NTA. Those reactions had nothing to do with you. That's the mixed bag of reactions you will get from the general population any time there is an accident causing a traffic jam (kind of what this was). If there's an accident on the side of the road causing a traffic backup you'll get some people saying I hope they're OK, some people figuring out who to blame, and some people just generally upset at the extra commute time. Thats just how people are. So don't let any those reactions make you feel any type of way, you did absolutely nothing wrong. Those guys were jerks and I'm sorry that happened to you there.", "NAH/ NTA\n\nI wish it was like Japan, where you could go get a \"Disabled\" keychain tag thing, or a \"Pregnant\" tag, meant for public transportation, which you could show to indicate that, yes, you are entitled to the priority seating.", "NTA maybe consider getting a medalert bracelet", "Why should they have to move because they got there before you I bet if this was the other way around it would have totally differnt responses", "That\u2019s sounds horrifying to have gone through. I\u2019m so sorry. On another note, I am totally here for your level of petty", "That\u2019s absolutely horrifying and I\u2019m sorry that happened to you.", "I don\u2019t think they\u2019re untrusting actually, I think they feel ashamed for taking a disabled seat and instead of just getting up graciously they have to come up with an excuse for why they are justified, projecting their bad feelings onto the person who unintentionally made them feel bad.", "NTA, don't worry, you did nothing wrong. Next time though maybe sit on the floor to avoid an injury? I get that the floor is not clean but better to shower and wash clothes than to hurt yourself (you could also perhaps carry a small blanket to sit on just in case?). And you will also make a point to everyone that you really need to sit down!"]}
