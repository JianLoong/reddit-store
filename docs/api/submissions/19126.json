It was sudden and unexpected and devastating, as we had been together for 32 years.  My Best friend lives an hour away, and although she doesn't drive, she dropped everything and found a ride to get to me within a day of finding out. She stayed with me about 4-5 days, and I was very grateful to have her. She even came back a second time and stayed for several days more. \n\nI'm still not ok. But I don't want-nor do I need-company right now. What I need right now is time alone to process things my own way and some quiet in which to do it. For this reason, I was kind of relieved when she finally went home.\n\nWell, when she gets home, I get a bunch of frenzied messages about how she got into it with her mom when she got home and her mom kicked her out. Basically, she's been living with her mom with no job or means of contributing for a very long time, and her mom is sick of it. \n\nYesterday, I guess things got really tough, so she messaged me and said that she is on her way to my house with her 19-y/o daughter to stay for who-knows-how-long. This also means that I'd be feeding the both of them, and they both smoke, so I'm sure they'd be expecting me to fund that, as well.\n\nI got a modest inheritance when I lost my mom a year ago, but it's not a fortune, and my partner died intestate, which in my state means I'm basically out of luck. To make a long story short, I have some money, but not alot, and cannot afford to support two other people. I'm also not in the right headspace for it, either. She never stops talking about how tough her life is, and right now I am just not in the mood to feel sorry for her.\n\nSo, I told her she needed to find somewhere else to stay. She sent me back a passive-aggressive message about how they're going to be in the shelter, but \"it's ok, you do you\". When she came the second time, she was constantly finding ways to make my partner's passing all about her, so I can't imagine what it would be like to have her here now.\n\nI am completely exhausted after being left to handle the details of a memorial and cremation of the love of my life by myself, and I am definitely not ok. I feel for her, but I also kind of feel like she got herself into her current position. I do have an extra room, but I'm sleeping in it, because our bed...well, I can't bear to sleep in it or have anyone else in it.\n\nI feel like I might be the asshole for not helping her, even though she came to help me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1686049062, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/142c6uz/aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_she_cant_come/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No one burdens people they love during a tragedy.", "NTA. Her and her daughter need to get jobs then maybe her mom wouldn\u2019t have kicked her out. Don\u2019t let them stay with you they\u2019ll never leave and expect you to support them.", "NTA. Do not let this \u201cfriend\u201d into your home for even another night.

Your friend isn't just needing a place to stay for a day or two while things blow over, nor can she support herself or her child. \n\nWhile it was very nice of her to stay with you, and honestly, probably something you needed more than you realize, she is not asking for an equitable favor in return.", "NTA- you are not a bad friend for giving someone your boundaries, she sees you as her and her daughters meal ticket.

If you absolutely do not want the marriage certificate, you need to do estate planning.  As OPs situation makes clear, you can't wait until you're old because unexpected deaths happen.", "NTA. I don't think her mom kicked her out in a vacuum.  The fact that she evidently expects you to feed and house her and her daughter for an indefinite amount of time without any word of how they'd contribute to the household is very telling of her character", "NTA. While she was supportive during your initial phase of grieving, she is a mooch, honestly.\n\nThis is a woman (40-something?) who does not work, has been living off her mom who is tired of her sponging. This woman now needs a NEW place to ~~mooch~~ land.\n\nYou did the right thing to turn away the woman and her daughter!  Much better to turn her down now than to let the 2 of them move in\\~and, ultimately have to kick them out.", "NTA. Friends who only do favours for people because they expect favours in return are not real friends. Especially not in this situation. You are dealing with a very traumatic experience and she\u2019s not respecting your boundaries. Instead she thinks \u201cwell I did this for you so now you have to kiss my butt\u201d. Absolutely not.", "NTA. This friend sounds like she would be awful to live with. She is a known leech who doesn't work and her own mother finally had enough of her shit. Also you say long term partner, in many states after 7 years living together you are considered common law marriage. So don't think because your partner didn't leave a will you are out of luck.
