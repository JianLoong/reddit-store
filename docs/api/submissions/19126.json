It was sudden and unexpected and devastating, as we had been together for 32 years.  My Best friend lives an hour away, and although she doesn't drive, she dropped everything and found a ride to get to me within a day of finding out. She stayed with me about 4-5 days, and I was very grateful to have her. She even came back a second time and stayed for several days more. \n\nI'm still not ok. But I don't want-nor do I need-company right now. What I need right now is time alone to process things my own way and some quiet in which to do it. For this reason, I was kind of relieved when she finally went home.\n\nWell, when she gets home, I get a bunch of frenzied messages about how she got into it with her mom when she got home and her mom kicked her out. Basically, she's been living with her mom with no job or means of contributing for a very long time, and her mom is sick of it. \n\nYesterday, I guess things got really tough, so she messaged me and said that she is on her way to my house with her 19-y/o daughter to stay for who-knows-how-long. This also means that I'd be feeding the both of them, and they both smoke, so I'm sure they'd be expecting me to fund that, as well.\n\nI got a modest inheritance when I lost my mom a year ago, but it's not a fortune, and my partner died intestate, which in my state means I'm basically out of luck. To make a long story short, I have some money, but not alot, and cannot afford to support two other people. I'm also not in the right headspace for it, either. She never stops talking about how tough her life is, and right now I am just not in the mood to feel sorry for her.\n\nSo, I told her she needed to find somewhere else to stay. She sent me back a passive-aggressive message about how they're going to be in the shelter, but \"it's ok, you do you\". When she came the second time, she was constantly finding ways to make my partner's passing all about her, so I can't imagine what it would be like to have her here now.\n\nI am completely exhausted after being left to handle the details of a memorial and cremation of the love of my life by myself, and I am definitely not ok. I feel for her, but I also kind of feel like she got herself into her current position. I do have an extra room, but I'm sleeping in it, because our bed...well, I can't bear to sleep in it or have anyone else in it.\n\nI feel like I might be the asshole for not helping her, even though she came to help me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1686049062, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/142c6uz/aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_she_cant_come/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No one burdens people they love during a tragedy.", "NTA. Her and her daughter need to get jobs then maybe her mom wouldn\u2019t have kicked her out. Don\u2019t let them stay with you they\u2019ll never leave and expect you to support them.", "NTA. Do not let this \u201cfriend\u201d into your home for even another night.

Your friend isn't just needing a place to stay for a day or two while things blow over, nor can she support herself or her child. \n\nWhile it was very nice of her to stay with you, and honestly, probably something you needed more than you realize, she is not asking for an equitable favor in return.", "NTA- you are not a bad friend for giving someone your boundaries, she sees you as her and her daughters meal ticket.

If you absolutely do not want the marriage certificate, you need to do estate planning.  As OPs situation makes clear, you can't wait until you're old because unexpected deaths happen.", "NTA. I don't think her mom kicked her out in a vacuum.  The fact that she evidently expects you to feed and house her and her daughter for an indefinite amount of time without any word of how they'd contribute to the household is very telling of her character", "NTA. While she was supportive during your initial phase of grieving, she is a mooch, honestly.\n\nThis is a woman (40-something?) who does not work, has been living off her mom who is tired of her sponging. This woman now needs a NEW place to ~~mooch~~ land.\n\nYou did the right thing to turn away the woman and her daughter!  Much better to turn her down now than to let the 2 of them move in\\~and, ultimately have to kick them out.", "NTA. Friends who only do favours for people because they expect favours in return are not real friends. Especially not in this situation. You are dealing with a very traumatic experience and she\u2019s not respecting your boundaries. Instead she thinks \u201cwell I did this for you so now you have to kiss my butt\u201d. Absolutely not.", "NTA. This friend sounds like she would be awful to live with. She is a known leech who doesn't work and her own mother finally had enough of her shit. Also you say long term partner, in many states after 7 years living together you are considered common law marriage. So don't think because your partner didn't leave a will you are out of luck.

It is too soon for you to be dealing with someone else's drama. Nta", "NTA", "First off my deepest condolences to you on your loss. You are definitely NTA but your friend surely is. To me and this is only my opinion. Is that your friend was waiting to pounce on you when you are at  your most vulnerable. \nIn order to mooch of you. \n\nYou did the right thing for yourself. You don't need to explain yourself to anyone.\n\nYour friend and her daughter need to get off thier butts and find employment.", "She\u2019s a forty-something-year-old unemployed moocher with an able bodied daughter and they both have expensive smoke habits. \n\nThere is no world in which letting them leech off you is a good idea. Tell her to get a job", "NTA  \n\n\nDid she came to help you? Or did she came in a recon mission? How coincidental it is for her to have this living arrangement problem right now... When you are suddenly available with an extra room!", "NTA...She is an opportunistic grifter taking advantage of your grief and vulnerability. She is \\*not\\* your friend: beware.", "But also, OP, you do not ever have to fund someone's smoking...", "NTA.  \nIt's hard to be causing anyone without meeting them, but it sounded like she saw your partner passing as an opportunity to move out of her mother's house and started slowly making her way into your house. \n\nAgain, I don't know the person nor I can know their intentions, but from an outside perspective, it looks a bit like that.", "Oh, I am so sorry, dear! It's the hardest thing. \n\nI had someone do similar, fly out the day after my husband suddenly passed. I was so dazed, and she just breezed in and took over, made the week about her and wanted to be entertained. A week after he died, I had a stroke. I guess I wasn't fun anymore and she went home. BUT, she has continued to hint about moving cross country to live with me, which would be a disaster. I cut her off and went NC. You need to do that same. Don't let her take advantage of your grief. You have more than enough to deal with without someone moving in on you and expecting you to support her and her daughter.\n\nAgain, I am so very sorry. If you need to talk, message me any time.", "NTA", "INFO: In what ways is she actually your friend?", "NTA Don't budge. You might lose her as a friend, but this is their true colors. No one who is your friend would burden you right now.  The nerve of them to invite themself.\n\nDid they do anything other than keep you company? Cook? Buy groceries? Clean? Mow the lawn? I doubt it. It was a vacation for them from the mother who is sick of them mooching off them.", "This seems to happen a lot.  Your now living without your spouse.  She sees that as an opportunity to move in to your place and have you support her and her kid.  She did not drop everything to visit you because she wanted to console you.  She did it to check out her new free crash pad.  She was obviously wearing out her welcome at home. \n\nShe will want you to feel obligated though. \n\nIf she moves in, you will not get her out.  This isn\u2019t something you need right now.  Please do not give in.\nReddit has shown that anyone with a spare room will be hit up for free accommodations.", "NTA. It's quite possible that both of those trips were in fact to help you, that despite her other flaws as a person she genuinely cares for you and wanted to support you as best she could. BUT if that's the case it still doesn't mean you owe her room and board in exchange for being a decent friend. I can't even fathom contacting a friend who'd experienced a loss like yours to tell her -- not even to *ask* her but to *tell* her -- that I expected her to put me and my child up in her house for an indefinite stay.\n\nI'm so sorry you're left to grieve this loss and I hope you find solace in the times to come.", "NTA. Girl, go NC with this person immediately. She was staking out your house to see if she and her daughter would be comfy there,  if you had the means to support them, and assessing your mental state to see what she could pull. She is a mooch and a fraud and trying to take advantage of you. Shame on her and I'm so sorry you had to find out what your friend was like when you needed her the most.", "Yeah this isnt a coincidence. Friend has wanted to move out for awhile and used Op\u2019s loss to get her foot in the door. Id bet anything she wont be at a shelter, she will go back to her parents and make amends", "Thanks you. Your comment sent me down a rabbit hole of intestate rules. I need to sort this."]}
