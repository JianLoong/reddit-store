In our traditions, we cremate our loved ones and follow more or less a 12-14 day ritual\u2026 At a suitable time, we release the ashes in the river (holy rivers like ganga, also known as ganges in english, is preferred but i released my father\u2019s ashes in the river of his motherland instead). What you said for your funeral or rather wish is similar to what we already do minus the hindu rituals. Although like you, I do not care much about where my body ends up (i\u2019d rather my body is used for science after my death), I honoured my father\u2019s wishes for a traditional funeral. What I\u2019m trying to say is, after you are gone, your family will always wonder if they did right by you in the end, so no matter how indifferent you feel, it would be good for your family to know what you sincerely want, whether it\u2019s cremation or being buried or you would prefer that they plan this instead of involving you. In every case you need to convey your feelings in a way that you won\u2019t regret in the end. And if you really do not wish to be involved tell them: \n\n\u201cI understand this brings such grief to everyone but I hope you all understand that in my remaining days I do not wish to talk about my own funeral and instead spend the rest of my remaining time as a living person who wouldn\u2019t regret dying. I believe whatever you all decide to do, you will do right by me, my life and my death. There are no wrong ways how you can send me off and if by the off chance there is an afterlife and my philosophy of atheism was wrong, I\u2019d smile on you all from there\u201d.\n\nI will withhold my judgement on this post as this is a very delicate issue and a very emotional one at that. All the best to you and your family and I hope you do right by them as you know they will do right by you", "NTA.\n\nIt really seems that your family--including your nephew and brother--are being purposely obtuse and creating drama for the sake of it. The drama could be a way of dealing with your impending death because you aren't creating enough of it yourself.\n\nThe next year should be about you living in peace from this kind of bullshit though. Your family should understand that you are not concerned about how they celebrate your life once you're gone. \n\nBut they do want your approval of their plans, which will help them through this long grieving period.\n\nWhy not throw them a bone or two and simply say, \"That sounds lovely\" instead of \"I don't care\"?", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your funeral.

Nevertheless,  it is they, not you, who should be apologizing to your nephew. \n\nBut that sounds unlikely.  \nI assume that you have made arrangements for your cremation? And that your wife is privy to those arrangements? I hope you have your wishes about medical care spelled out in writing.  If you don't have advance directives in place,  you will need to do that- both for your peace of mind and to potentially spare your family from some very difficult decisions in the event that you're unable to make those decisions for yourself at any point. \n\nI am sorry for the turmoil that comes with a terminal diagnosis. It sounds like they might benefit from meeting with a grief counselor and/or a support group- your primary care provider can probably offer referrals. \n\nI hope your remaining time is well spent and that, when the time comes, your exit is peaceful.", "NTA but funeral planning is hard, stressful, and most importantly aren\u2019t for you.

My mom and my other aunt were insistent upon planning her funeral with her. My aunt had already drawn up her own funeral plans a year prior, and she left the flowers and such to my mom and other aunt. My dying aunt absolutely broke down and asked them to leave.

What\u2019s important that you keep your wants well documented, and honestly, if you have the energy for it every single time they start off the conversation, change the subject let them know that you\u2019ve taken care of it and you\u2019d rather spend the time you have left with them without bringing it up.", "NTA.

But understand that you may have come to term with your mortality but your family hasn't. They are trying to have a sense of control over something they haven't and probably also keep their minds busy. Maybe they are hoping that if everything is perfect for the funeral it won't so hard and give them some comfort. They are going through a grieving process even if you are still there. You don't care about what happens to your body when you are gone so let them do whatever they need to cope. If you haven't yet maybe consider doing a video for them to watch when you are gone. Remember it is really hard for those who are left behind.

I also suspect your \"dark\" humor is a part of your coping mechanism. That doesn't make you an AH; it is ultimately your journey and path to travel. Grief (and make no mistake, you are grieving) is an intensely personal journey, is not linear, and should be respected at all costs. That being said, your loved ones are also navigating that incredibly difficult and heartbreaking path in their own way. Their needs along the way are not greater than/less than yours; they are just underandably different. \n\nThe Ring Circle theory has been an incredible resource to me in understanding and supporting loved ones through crisis and tragedy. Right now, you are the focal ring, and like grief, it allows for that focus to ebb and flow as the reality of the journey changes. \n\nUltimately, I guess what I am saying is NAH. You cope with your reality through dark humor and minimal expectations; your family copes with their reality through attempting to solidify order and resolution. Neither are wrong, and both are valid. Hopefully, you are all able to find grace, love, and peace through the coming days and months. I know, from experience, the days/months ahead will be horrendous for all of you, wishing you and your family all the peace and grace during this unfathomably difficult time.", "NAH funerals are for the living. I complete respect your views and wishes but maybe try and humor them? They are going to grieve your loss and while you may not care this will be part of their closure and make them feel like they\u2019re doing something to honor you. Maybe try to make small requests like having people share their favorite story of you, make a request that they serve your favorite meal, what kind of music you want played, when the ashes are scattered you want everyone to have your favorite drink in your honor or go to your favorite restaurant after etc. Try and think of it as helping them after your gone, it\u2019s much harder to be the people that are being left than to be the one doing the leaving.", "NTA.

Now stick out your stupid arm\"\n\nIt effectively ended his defiance because he was too busy laughing his ass off to fight with us anymore. \n\nDark humor has its place and is usually born of frustration.\n\nNTA", "NAH. Story time: Friend fighting cancer tells her husband while I was there, \"I told you to bury my body out in the woods somewhere.\" Husband says, \"And I told you that's illegal.\" I interjected, \"Just tell her you'll do it and when she's dead just do whatever you want. She won't know.\" Your family is having a hard time. I get that it's your end of life, but maybe instead of answering the question of, \"What do you want done with your dead body,\" pretend like they're asking, \"What process will help us grieve our loss of you?\" See if that helps you have the conversation that they seem to need?", "YTA. . . They love you and want to honor you/your body. You don't care what happens to you when you are gone, but they are going to have to find ways to cope, and making crude comments about whats going to happen to your body isn't helping.", "NAH \n\n[Just say \"I'm sorry for your loss\" and move on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKOrr4XRbg8)", "NTA - but you do owe your family a bit more than money. They need to go on and grieve. The funeral is more for the living than the dead. It gives a chance to say goodbye, to share memories, etc. It\u2019s a vital function and humans have been having funerals for thousands of years. Even Neanderthals had burials.[Neanderthals burials](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/05/europe/neanderthal-burials-skeleton-study-scn/index.html)", "NTA. People need to start listening when people say exactly what they want.", "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dying. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re at peace. As someone who lost my dad at a young age, as hard as that was, watching my mother try to get through her grief of being a widow before she was 50 was rough. Now not only are they angry at you, they have the guilt do being angry too. Maybe some preemptive counseling would help your family.", "NTA. I laughed out loud reading this! They should have respected what you wanted and should have dropped it. It is their problem, not yours. Go out in flames...I am here for it.", "NAH, I can't imagine what you're going through. I hope you can find comfort and closure and that your family is able to accept your decisions. I hope they also have the time to make closure and that you do get through this.", "How did you end up married in the first place? YTA", "NTA. However, you may find yourself feeling differently as this year goes by, so keep this in mind if they respond flippantly when you don\u2019t want them to.", "NTA. My Dad was an atheist and wanted to be cremated spread anywhere. He didn't want to be in an earn forever. He also wanted a life celebration instead of a wake. I was 15 (didn't drink) but it was one hell of a pub party.\n\nI hope your family can come around to see your wishes fulfilled. I don't think they are being AH either, it must be hard to start the grieving process of someone still living.", "NTA. The last thing you need right now is strife over this crap. Tell them to do whatever they want and request that they make your remaining time enjoyable rather than a damn fight.", "NAH but if you want the conversation to stop just give them a real answer  Right now you're pissing them off intentionally and then getting defensive when they're getting pissed. Just telll them to cremate you and put you in the ocean if you really dont care, and emd the nonsense.", "I also am not big on pomp and circumstance. I just want to be cremated and scattered myself. That\u2019s what a will is for\u2014to put YOUR last wishes in.\n\nNTA but it might just be good for all of you to acknowledge how much your emotions might be influencing your reactions to things.", "YTA. you die and it ends for you. They will grieve until they die. While it is perfectly reasonable for you to be focused on yourself, you say you don\u2019t care. But shouldn\u2019t you care about those who love you?  FFS make something up and give them the comfort of honoring you in a way they think you want.", "I'm so sorry you're going through this. But many people use this kind of gallows humor to deal with unpleasant subjects. \n\n I'm from a family that uses gallows humor a lot. When my grandmother was 90 and going through treatment for cancer, one of my aunt's (her daughter) tactlessly asked her if she had enough life insurance to take care of the burial after she died. My grandma said yes, but if not, \"just throw me in the weeds and burn me!\" \nA few years after my grandma passed, my mom and I were talking about that and laughing, and I asked, with fake seriousness, if she had enough to take care of her funeral. My mom's reply? \" Yes, but if I don't, just stick a bone up my ass and let the dogs drag me away.\" \ud83d\ude02", "NAH, but I enjoy a macabre sense of humor. So did my dad. I have a story about him:\n\nMy dad passed in 2016. He was cremated, and my mom has his urn. It's pretty, but urns get dusty. I joked a few times during separate visits that \"dad needs dusting again\". My mom eventually decided to put a baseball cap on the urn. Simple solution, right? Only my mom really likes the \"Life Is Good\" brand, and that is what the logo was on the cap. After I stopped laughing, I sent photos to my siblings. And I ordered a baseball cap with his favorite sports team. \n\nOP, I hope you work things out with your family and enjoy what time you have left.", "NTA. This reminded me of a friend of mine who wants to be turned into chum and fed to sharks at sea. Do a whole Ocean funeral.", "NAH, however i can understand your nephew being upset for being dragged into it, esp if other family members got mad at him.", "NTA. They aren\u2019t respecting your wishes. Get it in writing and appoint someone who can be more neutral (like a friend or distant cousin) to be the executor of your will to ensure your wishes are respected. \n\nWhen my grandmother passed, she wanted to be cremated. My dad thought there would be a complete cremation with no leftovers. The funeral director told him and his two sisters there is always something left so they need to decide what to do. My dad says \u201cdo you have a compost pile out back?\u201d \n\nOne of my aunts was not amused, but me and my dad thought it was fucking hilarious. To each their own.", "You could ask them to donate your body to science. (cremation is free at the end too)", "Personally I want to be turned into a diamond and set in a beautiful ring with my dog who is also now a diamond. NTA but maybe you can sit down with your family and ask them what they see for your final resting place. Maybe they have some ideas that could help them cope. Planting a tree, making you into jewelry, putting you in a grave so they can visit. This is hard on everyone", "I initially didn't realize that your death is imminent.  I'm sorry. If you really don't care, then let them know to do what makes them feel best. All you of must be in pain and that can mean short fuses. Try to be forgiving. Of your loved ones and yourself. They are probably resigned to the fact that the have no control over making your life longer. So they are probably sensitive about something that can control.  \n\nIt doesn't matter who's the AH  They carea", "My housemate's dad was cremated last year, she told us to wear funny t-shirts to the funeral, and her mom has the urn at the family home.  In October, they put a sheet with eyeholes over the urn and move it from room to room.  I'm waiting for the December they pull something similar with an elf hat.", "A good friend of mine is a potter and wants his ashes to be put into a ash glaze for some future potters to use. For non potters an ash glaze is usually made from wood ash but his would probably work also.", "I just laughed so hard it gave me hiccups. We should be friends.", "> Family needs to know what your last wishes are and what you want done with your body should you die.\n\nIf only he told them how he wanted to be cremated and his ashes scattered in the reservoir of a city he hates...

I love this.", "It's a different city from where we live.", "Put yourself in some corn, they'll get to see you twice", "Have you seen the cremation/bbq episode of Married with Children?  I highly recommend it.  Seriously though, I'm sorry this is happening to you.  It really sucks.", "Their version of Elf on a Shelf?", "I wish you the best on this journey. You are a stronger man than most.", "I actually thought that sub-comment was hilarious. \n\nWhy not? You\u2019ll get your wishes, and your nephew might yet become the next Banksy.", "As one of those people I can indeed verify that it smelled like hot garbage", "It was Portland.  I looked it up.", "It's not water for my city.", "Yep. My grandfather passed recently, and I was in charge of organising everything. He had specific wishes that I honoured, and it did help me knowing I was doing what he wanted. \n\nI think NAH, because the family is dealing with a tough situation.
