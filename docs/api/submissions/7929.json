In our traditions, we cremate our loved ones and follow more or less a 12-14 day ritual\u2026 At a suitable time, we release the ashes in the river (holy rivers like ganga, also known as ganges in english, is preferred but i released my father\u2019s ashes in the river of his motherland instead). What you said for your funeral or rather wish is similar to what we already do minus the hindu rituals. Although like you, I do not care much about where my body ends up (i\u2019d rather my body is used for science after my death), I honoured my father\u2019s wishes for a traditional funeral. What I\u2019m trying to say is, after you are gone, your family will always wonder if they did right by you in the end, so no matter how indifferent you feel, it would be good for your family to know what you sincerely want, whether it\u2019s cremation or being buried or you would prefer that they plan this instead of involving you. In every case you need to convey your feelings in a way that you won\u2019t regret in the end. And if you really do not wish to be involved tell them: \n\n\u201cI understand this brings such grief to everyone but I hope you all understand that in my remaining days I do not wish to talk about my own funeral and instead spend the rest of my remaining time as a living person who wouldn\u2019t regret dying. I believe whatever you all decide to do, you will do right by me, my life and my death. There are no wrong ways how you can send me off and if by the off chance there is an afterlife and my philosophy of atheism was wrong, I\u2019d smile on you all from there\u201d.\n\nI will withhold my judgement on this post as this is a very delicate issue and a very emotional one at that. All the best to you and your family and I hope you do right by them as you know they will do right by you", "NTA.\n\nIt really seems that your family--including your nephew and brother--are being purposely obtuse and creating drama for the sake of it. The drama could be a way of dealing with your impending death because you aren't creating enough of it yourself.\n\nThe next year should be about you living in peace from this kind of bullshit though. Your family should understand that you are not concerned about how they celebrate your life once you're gone. \n\nBut they do want your approval of their plans, which will help them through this long grieving period.\n\nWhy not throw them a bone or two and simply say, \"That sounds lovely\" instead of \"I don't care\"?", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your funeral.

Nevertheless,  it is they, not you, who should be apologizing to your nephew. \n\nBut that sounds unlikely.  \nI assume that you have made arrangements for your cremation? And that your wife is privy to those arrangements? I hope you have your wishes about medical care spelled out in writing.  If you don't have advance directives in place,  you will need to do that- both for your peace of mind and to potentially spare your family from some very difficult decisions in the event that you're unable to make those decisions for yourself at any point. \n\nI am sorry for the turmoil that comes with a terminal diagnosis. It sounds like they might benefit from meeting with a grief counselor and/or a support group- your primary care provider can probably offer referrals. \n\nI hope your remaining time is well spent and that, when the time comes, your exit is peaceful.", "NTA but funeral planning is hard, stressful, and most importantly aren\u2019t for you.

My mom and my other aunt were insistent upon planning her funeral with her. My aunt had already drawn up her own funeral plans a year prior, and she left the flowers and such to my mom and other aunt. My dying aunt absolutely broke down and asked them to leave.

What\u2019s important that you keep your wants well documented, and honestly, if you have the energy for it every single time they start off the conversation, change the subject let them know that you\u2019ve taken care of it and you\u2019d rather spend the time you have left with them without bringing it up.", "NTA.

But understand that you may have come to term with your mortality but your family hasn't. They are trying to have a sense of control over something they haven't and probably also keep their minds busy. Maybe they are hoping that if everything is perfect for the funeral it won't so hard and give them some comfort. They are going through a grieving process even if you are still there. You don't care about what happens to your body when you are gone so let them do whatever they need to cope. If you haven't yet maybe consider doing a video for them to watch when you are gone. Remember it is really hard for those who are left behind.

I also suspect your \"dark\" humor is a part of your coping mechanism. That doesn't make you an AH; it is ultimately your journey and path to travel. Grief (and make no mistake, you are grieving) is an intensely personal journey, is not linear, and should be respected at all costs. That being said, your loved ones are also navigating that incredibly difficult and heartbreaking path in their own way. Their needs along the way are not greater than/less than yours; they are just underandably different. \n\nThe Ring Circle theory has been an incredible resource to me in understanding and supporting loved ones through crisis and tragedy. Right now, you are the focal ring, and like grief, it allows for that focus to ebb and flow as the reality of the journey changes. \n\nUltimately, I guess what I am saying is NAH. You cope with your reality through dark humor and minimal expectations; your family copes with their reality through attempting to solidify order and resolution. Neither are wrong, and both are valid. Hopefully, you are all able to find grace, love, and peace through the coming days and months. I know, from experience, the days/months ahead will be horrendous for all of you, wishing you and your family all the peace and grace during this unfathomably difficult time.", "NAH funerals are for the living. I complete respect your views and wishes but maybe try and humor them? They are going to grieve your loss and while you may not care this will be part of their closure and make them feel like they\u2019re doing something to honor you. Maybe try to make small requests like having people share their favorite story of you, make a request that they serve your favorite meal, what kind of music you want played, when the ashes are scattered you want everyone to have your favorite drink in your honor or go to your favorite restaurant after etc. Try and think of it as helping them after your gone, it\u2019s much harder to be the people that are being left than to be the one doing the leaving.", "NTA.

You vent outward away from the center of grief, not inward towards the center.\n\nI would like to share a family story you may find funny. We knew my MIL was dying, and all her affairs were well in order. She said frequently that once she was gone, her body was just an empty shell, and we could put her on the curb in a hefty bag for all she cared. Her family had her sense of humor and found it funny.\n\nMIL passed, the service was touching, and her ashes moved to a box in BIL\u2019s house. The day came where he needed to move suddenly and hired both cleaners and movers. MIL\u2019s ashes disappeared during that move, and we\u2019re comforted and entertained by the fact that she likely got what she wanted in the end. Her sense of humor would be satisfied.\n\nEveryone else we share the story with is horrified.", "NTA. You wife and kids are just making things worse for you. I'm on your side. I think funerals are a big waste of money and told my family that after all usable parts are taken out, they can donate me to a body farm. I don't care. My oldest sister died in 2019 and she was cremated. I had her ashes in the trunk of my car for over a year. I wasn't about to bring a box of possible cat litter in the house with 4 cats running around. If they had gotten into that she would have come back and haunted my ass. LOL", "NAH\n\nWhile you've made your peace with the inevitable, it's clear your family hasn't. The wake, the funeral, the disposition of the body aren't for the deceased, but for the living...once you're gone you wouldn't know if they got the Dalai Lama to say services or dumped your body from the Golden Gate onto a garbage scow.\n\nExplain what you want (cremation) and how they can turn that into a celebration of your life. See about attending family counseling together to help them comes to term with things.\n\nI'm sorry about your situation.", "It's easier for people to feel anger than grief. It's very common for grieving people to pick fights with each other because the anger is a relief to alternative. Your loved ones are doing their best to manage their pain and it's a bit messy and dramatic. I'm not sure how you want to handle this but just understanding this might be helpful on it's own. NAH", "I\u2019ve seen what happens to families that don\u2019t have the closure of a decent funeral or memorial service. You want what\u2019s best for them, yeah?  Especially with children, a service can be instrumental to their recovery from their loss of you. I would say you\u2019re pretty stoic for handling your situation as far as coming to terms with it.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re the AH, but maybe humor them a little and tell them to plan something. Then you can just say yes and let it go.", "NAH\n\nI used to work at the airport inspecting passenger bags and suitcases. I tapped a box one man brought along with his suitcases and asked him what was in it. He replied it was his mom - he took her on all his travels. She had been a single mom and had always wanted to travel but never had the money for it. Now that he was wealthy, he took her with him.\n\nApologize to your nephew for involving him... and that's about it. Maybe apologize to wife and kids because you can't really care what happens to you after you're dead, specify they can do with your ashes as they will. Tell them they can take you to a nice park to scatter your ashes.", "Ummm excuse me but people pay stupid money for unopened bananas labeled as art. What is to say that someone wouldn\u2019t pay stupid amounts of money for a once in a lifetime weird ass installation art piece??/s\n\nIn all seriousness, I love the jewelry idea. If jewelry isn\u2019t OP\u2019s style, he can have his artist nephew turn his ashes into a painting, sculpture or glass.", "This. NAH but if you truly don't care, just humor them. Let them have whatever they need to grieve you. Think of it as making sure you're taken care of emotionally. \n\nI'm an atheist and I once told my mom I didn't want a Catholic funeral service when I'm gone. But she pointed out that the service is not for the dead, it's for the grieving. And honestly she's right, I won't even know what happens when I die but if a religious service is how they want to mourn me then why would I take that away from them?", "I got a good laugh with my sister's ashes being in my trunk. A car that looked like mine was involved in a robbery and the police, just to be through, asked if they could look in mine. No problem. One office took out the box of ashes and asked what it was. Just as he opened the top, I told him my sister. I don't think I've ever seen a guy lose color that fast. If his partner hadn't been standing close when he dropped the box sis would have been blowin in the wind. To this day when I see him he gives me a dirty look and I laugh.", "Maybe pull a Tupac and get them to roll you into some blunts.", "I spit out my coffee reading your first sentence.\n\nThe art idea is a good one too!", "Okay, that right there is brilliant. I have never understood this cultural insistence on \"honouring the wishes of the dead.\" They're dead. They don't *care*. How is it so unforgiveable to cremate someone who wanted to be buried, or vice versa? To bury/scatter them in a place they didn't choose, simply because it's more convenient, cheaper, or more significant to the survivors?"]}
