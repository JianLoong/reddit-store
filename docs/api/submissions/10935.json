Even in front of management. \n\nHis father is about to be getting a corporate promotion soon and the rest of management is nervous to step on his toes. Thusly his son feels untouchable and somewhat is. Sits on his phone while people around him work, walks off from jobs he doesn't want to do, tries to order around coworkers. Three times he's crashed a forklift into the building, one time taking out a bay door that was $150k to fix. \n\nYet nothing happens. \n\nI'm very well liked by my peers and management both. I make it a point to be super kind to each person around me, jump in if someone is struggling, and I don't like to see people get overwhelmed. I try to be a model employee and someone people can trust to help them if it's needed. We are a team of 45 people and I want them all to know they can depend on me. \n\nThat being said, I walked into a situation where the Manager's son was standing idly by while someone had too large of a load on their shoulders and went down hard. I immediately got the lumber off of my coworker, proceeded to check on him, and once getting the hurt employee to get medical attention (ended up just being bumped and bruised) I lost my shit a bit. \n\nI found the Manager's son in a group of people, standing around watching them work, after just letting someone else get hurt (he should have done what any of us would have done and helped our coworker carry the load) and I proceeded to yell at him, borderline scream, about how he's an unreliable asshole, how he's always on his damn phone, and most of all he's a lazy daddy's boy. I went on about how DARE he stand by and watch someone get hurt when he could have prevented it. \n\nI went off for a full 5 minutes while everyone around us chuckled and agreed what a loser of a worker he is. I was expecting him to yell back and maybe swing on me. Instead he blushed so hard his entire head was purple, he stumbled over his words (nobody knew what he was trying to say), and worst of all he started crying. Bad. \n\nHe ended up leaving for the day and I have felt like an asshole. I am not the person at work to tear someone down like that. Management got a chuckle out of it (even his own dad) and said he's going to be on probation for the way he's been acting. I faced no consequences for my outburst. \n\nI still feel like a real tool for losing my cool and handling it that way.

And hopefully come to a compromise that's satisfactory for both parties.\n\n\nThen you've got destructive.

It's where anger is expressed in an aggressive or threatening way.\nExamples are: punching someone, throwing with things, breaking things, hurting yourself, screaming, insulting someone or yourself.\n\n\nUsually people express their anger in a destructive manner because they bottle things up or neglect multiple opportunities to express themselves in a constructive manner.\nDestructive expression of anger usually only results in more negative feelings and animosity.\nConstructive expression of anger actually gets to the core of the issue and creates a safe opportunity for learning.\nIf your goal is to solve an interpersonal conflict, yelling is never appropriate.\n\n\nScreaming and insulting your coworker is destructive.\nESH", "YTA - I am big on when people scream, regardless of reason they are automaticly the asshole.
