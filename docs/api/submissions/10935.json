The unfortunate issue is we do, and, he's the classic management's son profile. He sits on his phone while we're supposed to be working ALL the time. Even in front of management. \n\nHis father is about to be getting a corporate promotion soon and the rest of management is nervous to step on his toes. Thusly his son feels untouchable and somewhat is. Sits on his phone while people around him work, walks off from jobs he doesn't want to do, tries to order around coworkers. Three times he's crashed a forklift into the building, one time taking out a bay door that was $150k to fix. \n\nYet nothing happens. \n\nI'm very well liked by my peers and management both. I make it a point to be super kind to each person around me, jump in if someone is struggling, and I don't like to see people get overwhelmed. I try to be a model employee and someone people can trust to help them if it's needed. We are a team of 45 people and I want them all to know they can depend on me. \n\nThat being said, I walked into a situation where the Manager's son was standing idly by while someone had too large of a load on their shoulders and went down hard. I immediately got the lumber off of my coworker, proceeded to check on him, and once getting the hurt employee to get medical attention (ended up just being bumped and bruised) I lost my shit a bit. \n\nI found the Manager's son in a group of people, standing around watching them work, after just letting someone else get hurt (he should have done what any of us would have done and helped our coworker carry the load) and I proceeded to yell at him, borderline scream, about how he's an unreliable asshole, how he's always on his damn phone, and most of all he's a lazy daddy's boy. I went on about how DARE he stand by and watch someone get hurt when he could have prevented it. \n\nI went off for a full 5 minutes while everyone around us chuckled and agreed what a loser of a worker he is. I was expecting him to yell back and maybe swing on me. Instead he blushed so hard his entire head was purple, he stumbled over his words (nobody knew what he was trying to say), and worst of all he started crying. Bad. \n\nHe ended up leaving for the day and I have felt like an asshole. I am not the person at work to tear someone down like that. Management got a chuckle out of it (even his own dad) and said he's going to be on probation for the way he's been acting. I faced no consequences for my outburst. \n\nI still feel like a real tool for losing my cool and handling it that way. I could have used it as a learning experience and instead I humiliated a guy in front of a bunch of his buddies. \n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1677373166, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11c15x4/aita_for_making_my_coworker_cry/", "score": 215, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The guy being on the phone is a hazard in such a workplace. I\u2019d recommend you have a conversation with him where you apologise for the earlier incident but at the same time highlight the frame of mind you were in when you lost your cool.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d also highlight the dangers involved and stress the benefits of working as a team and looking out for one another.

(A necessary skill to possess even if you never hold a management position.) \n\nMaybe be straight with him. Tell him you're frustrated because you watch him day in and day out take his position in this company for granted - and does so on the back of his father's hard work and achievements. Let him know that if he doesn't feel any responsibility toward his job or his coworkers, he could at least feel some toward his father. Tell him that he's in a better position than most to learn and grow in the company quickly - and he's epically blowing that opportunity and possibly putting his dad's career potential in jeopardy in the process. \n\nThen remind him he's a good kid, but he needs to get his shit together or move on.", "INFO\n\n> I found the Manager's son in a group of people\n\nI don't understand this part.

Would it not have been dangerous for your boss's son to intervene?", "INFO A door costs $150K to fix? Really really?", "NTA, but you probably could have handled it a bit better.

Maybe it makes him change, but it\u2019s more likely that he\u2019ll just whine to someone and try to get *you* in trouble.\n\nHis father being a manager is also a massive conflict of interest.

You may have gone on a bit too long, but clearly the senior management agrees with your general actions. NTA", "You work at a lumber mill that is dangerous work. Kid isn't cut out for it and should find a cozy office to slack off all day. Lots of kids like that show up at my job, and the only thing that gets their attention is when you confront them like this. Sometimes, you have to be an asshole because people's limbs are on the line. There is no nice way to say it, especially when someone gets hurt. Do not apologize to him or he will think you're in the wrong not him. He needs to understand what he is doing is wrong, and clearly his dad failed him on that regard.", "NTA- you can certainly apologize for losing your cool, but that is all. I can't tell if you are in the US or not, but if you are, you may want to make sure he's current with all OAHA certs AND perhaps send him to a safety seminar. Those presenters love to outline the most gruesome outcomes and it's powerful! Perhaps scare him straight a bit.", "The fact you feel bad means NTA.  Privately offer to go to lunch with Manager's son.  Tell him you were worried about the dangerous situation you had just handled and disappointed that he did not step up when needed.  If you could honestly mean it, encourage him to come to you if he has work questions and indicate you are willing to give advice, if he wants it.  Other than that, there is nothing you can do.", "NTA The higher upside created this situation by letting him work there despite being a liability. His coworker could have been seriously hurt or killed.", "NTA  - It seems like OP yelled what everyone else (even his own dad) was thinking. Considering Manager's Son stood idly by and watch an accident happen he could have prevented, an accident that could have resulted in serious injury or death, OP losing it was perfectly justified especially in light of his own shining work ethic. This was a learning experience, a much needed one for the Manager's Son. OP is being too hard on himself and that's rarely, if ever, the sign of a true A-hole.", "ESH Him for obvious reasons. You, though, for not fixing the safety issues here. **No one** should be carrying heavy loads alone. This is a seeps failure in your part as well as those above you.\n\nLike it or not, your culture let this happen. It\u2019s not entirely all his fault. Read up on the company that focused only on safety after a change in leadership. That company soared because focusing on one thing, safety, empowered **everyone** to be safe. Which then made them **feel and be** safer, which led to a great culture. \n\nWhat you\u2019re doing is directly helping a culture that doesn\u2019t enforce safety and is actively putting people in danger. **Be better.**", "NTA but I feel bad for him, I take it he really doesn\u2019t want to be there, but family ties got him locked into it.", "Nta, but I'm not sure how to feel about the standing around dude. Did he stand around after the guy got hurt? Did he not check in on the guy? He just walked off somewhere else to be idle?", "It was a learning experience for him. He is probably a member of a dysfunctional family who provided a terrible environment to learn the lessons of life. You were not being cruel for no reason, and there are worse things in life than getting yelled at. You can always talk to him later, explain how you and others felt about what his behaviour. Maybe he just needs some feedback from someone who is not family, and this was it, but you could also give some positive feedback like mentioning he was an ok guy besides that.

I'm the one being tapped for management which is why I feel like such an ass for not handling it better. He's barely holding onto his job. \n\nI don't want him fired or gone. I want to help him be a better version of himself. I try to not leave a man behind.", "No.  OP didn't do the father a favour, he did his job.", "Very good insight and I appreciate it. I definitely am trying to use this as an opportunity to grow.", "After someone gets hurt, a group of people will show up very quickly.  \n\nIf other people we're around before the guy went down, they would've helped so I think its safe to assume the managers son was the only one there who could've helped in time.", "What I mean is the 15-20 minutes after I had been with the hurt employee getting him checked out, I went back to find the Manager's son (totally pissed off, which wasn't helpful of me) and I found him with a group of people.", "Sometimes people get over zealous and try and do more than they should. We have training and protocols we're taught.

I thought the price was absurd as well until I saw the paperwork for it.", "Indeed. We had someone destroy a bay door with a forklift at a former place of employment and it was only $10K less than what OP mentioned for repairs.", "I don't know if this story will be worth an update in the future, but I am curious as to whether this kid tries to either get out of the job, or change for the better.", "I think you are not as AH in this case just because you felt like a tool for losing it, and its OK to feel like an ass because of it, thats because you knew you fucked up, but thats ok, you'll learn from this, and the only \"harm\" if any was the kid got an earful, which he fully deserved.", "Precisely. Thank you for offering a better worded explanation than I did. I appreciate it.", "It might be probable to assume that, but I am not in the habit of making safe assumptions because assumptions don't always tend to be right. Been burned too many times by life. I'd rather operate only on assumption when I have no choice.\n\nHowever I realized that I missed a statement earlier in their post which does answer my question, so my confusion was a mistake.", "I think it's obvious you're NTA now that I have my confusion cleared up.", "I'll post an update in a few weeks if there's anything drastic in either direction.", "Management was super amused that he got his ass chewed. We have a policy at our work that we all speak openly and are expected to communicate with one another. If it was a new guy or a hard worker there would likely have been an intervention from a supervisor or manager. \n\nBut with who it was they thought it was quite humorous how badly he got chewed out and especially since it was me. \n\nI feel bad for making him cry and not making it a learning experience. I was caught up in the adrenaline from a hurt coworker. \n\nI appreciate your feedback and your input. Thank you!", "OP just answered the commenter and said that they explained the situation precisely.", "NTA, the kid needed a reality check. He has been beyond lucky that so far he\u2019s *only* crashed the forklift into the building and the door, maybe his fourth crash would\u2019ve been the one that permanently maimed or even **killed**someone. \n\nI guarantee, no matter how bad you\u2019re feeling now, you would absolutely feel infinitely worse if someone were to die as a result of this kid\u2019s negligence in the future and you knew you\u2019d had this opportunity to set him straight but didn\u2019t.", "NTA\n\nBut it's not a great way to go about it. His Dad should have said it if no one else would. \nI feel for the guy, but you've done him a favour. Hopefully, it's a wake-up call.", "Oh mate, I feel for you. You did right. Please don't feel bad at all. Bumps and bruises are the best case scenario, it could have been so much worse.\n\nYou did right and it might not feel that way right now,  but in a few years you'll be able to look back and feel proud of how you cared for people around you, stood up for them, and took steps to try to prevent it from happening in the future.\n\nGood on ya, mate!  NTA!", "If you feel like you acted wrongly, and excessively embarrassed him in front of everyone, you should apologize in front of everyone.", "NTA\n\nThe only thing I'd recommend is making a concise list of what the son has done wrong and when and where and how you addressed it. These things can be unpredictable, especially if the son is connected to management. CYA would keep them from going after you or someone giving a consequence because they suddenly feel like you were bullying the son or something.", "Well, I would normally advocate for talking through the situation peacefully when you start actively putting other people in danger. There comes a time that you just need to chew someone a new a hole", "NTA, and I wouldn't apologize but I would speak with him and ensure he understands why you yelled and where he screwed up badly. Sometimes a wake-up call like that is the best thing to happen to someone.\n\nIf you're up to the challenge, have you considered directly training him yourself? As in, he's your shadow, and you can keep him busy and learning throughout his shift, helping you directly or doing what needs to be done with the customers?", "NTA.\n\nBut would be good to make peace with him and explain why you reacted the way you did.  He will be much more inclined to learn from it then.", "NTA.  I mean it was harsh, but come on, he really needed to get a clue.   And, I guess now you know he\u2019s not untouchable.  Lol."]}
