So I usually message my stepsister who lives over seas to communicate. I told her a year ago it was time for her and her siblings to come together and make plans for their father because my mom was unable to do it. A year passes and now he needs round the clock care.

Hospice as you may know provides only supplemental care (eta if you\u2019re not when 6 months of dying) he needs ROUND THE CLOCK care. Stepbrother has medical power of attorney over t stepfather and has long ago shut my mom out of her husbands medical affairs. Instead of collaborating with us he makes decisions in a silo. I could\u2019ve told him that hospice wasn\u2019t going to be enough. Now the social workers want my mom to miss her flight and stay while he gets (eta: round the clock long term care for example a nursing facility or a home health aide) long term care situated. I put my foot down and said no and my mom agrees let his son figure that out. My mom literally should not be caring for him. Any one with compassion could see that. \n\nAm I the AH?

That is why she is moving in with you. Also tell them you gave his children plenty of time to find care and you told them hospice was not enough but they ignored you. Your step father is no longer your concern you need to take care of your mother. I hate to see you and the step fighting because your parents are still husband and wife and they may want to see each other.", "NTA Just ensure that the social worker has all 4 of his children\u2019s contact information and not your mother\u2019s. Tie up any legal matters before she leaves too.", "NTA. Glad your mum can relax a bit with you all.", "You are doing the right thing by taking your mother out of the picture.  I'm strongly inclined to say that you should have done it sooner.  You recognised a year ago that the stepsiblings needed to take responsibility then, but I think you would have been wise to give them a shorter deadline, say, a month.  However, that's done, and it is not your fault that your stepsiblings are too selfish to care for their own father.\n\nIt looks as though the only way for the stepsiblings to take responsibility is to hand it to them and get out of the way, so get your mother away from there as soon as you can.  Do not let your mother stay while this is sorted out. The people who need to know about the situation do know about it, they now have to do something about it.  And they can whine about it as much as they like, which they will, but it is no longer your concern.\n\nNTA", "If you are in the US, there is palliative care, which is a step up from hospice. Medicare takes care of all of it. But there are systems and checks in place. And im not sure if there is round the clock care until it becomes a hospice situation. My mother is on palliative care. We set up days and times for nurses to come, aides to come for bathes and stuff. Social services comes once a month to check in. There is even a non denominational Person to come and have conversations and prayers. She is evaluated every two months i believe. it was originally supposed to be six months but govt changed the rules. My mother will not get better but at the moment is not getting worse. My father and i care for her daily needs, but the extra help is a saving grace. My own sibling could care less. \n\nIts not yours or your mothers responsibility to care for him. And social services should NOT be guilting your mom to stay and help. Pack her up and move her in. Its time she gets to enjoy being a grammie. His kids can do the grunt work now.\n\nNTA", "Let him figure it out. Your mother is DONE.", "Info. Can you call the authorities on them? This is clearly elder abuse by neglect", "Info:\n\nWait, I'm confused. You want your step-siblings to care for their father, you've removed your mother from the picture and so you have no stake in it - but you're angry that those step-siblings are making decisions without your feedback *after* you *told* them to do so?\n\nAnd - your argument here is that hospice, of all care options, isn't round the clock?

I have no one to talk to about this soo thanks for that reassurance. No one my age has dealt with this so they have no advice for me. It feels soo alienating. I\u2019m actually probably an expert having dealt with my FIL who passed away with no end of life plans also.", "The social worker wanted to call EPS on my mom actually. Apparently even though the medical POA is with the son my mom is still somehow responsible? I don\u2019t think the social worker is 100% correct though", "Not all hospice is around the clock care. Some check in to see how the person is doing then visits increase as the person health begins to decline. If you want around the clock care you need a live in nurse, nursing home, or assisted living.", "It\u2019s only round the clock Care if you\u2019re dying", "No I should\u2019ve worded it better I\u2019m wondering if I am the ah for taking my mom out of the picture.", "Even if you have end of life plan it's up to the ones who have the POA over you to follow your plan. Same thing with your funeral, you may have plans but again it's up to others to decide. And I'll say it blunt, it's not up to you to decide what happens to someone you have no legal power over. if your step dads kids drop the ball and fail him that's because they are selfish brats who don't even care for their parent. Your concern now is your mother and making what time she has left a lot easier.", "Also make it clear that your mother is not his medical proxy and that his son is the only one with authority to make health decisions!! \nThese kinds of things can be very isolating. Death is not something people like to discuss.  \nYou are absolutely NTA, but you are a very good daughter!!\n\n~edited to fix a gender mistake", "I found that out the painful way with my FIL they refused to take him even though he was dying with stage 4 cancer.

Due to advancements in medicine for strong and healthy people it's not necessarily a death sentence anymore. It's not uncommon for people to pass away shortly after entering care facilities. But that's not on you it's on them and what they do with their father. At least your mother raised you right. Just wait till they get older adn their kids do the same things they did.", "Well damn!! Im sorry and have fixed it!!", "NTA that social worker is off *her* rocker if she thinks your elderly mom is capable or should miss her flight to care for stepdad... If your step-brother has locked your mom out of medical care then there's really nothing more you or your mom can do. And if your steps won't actually do anything either, well. The only thing left is for you to get your mom out of there.", "NTA but who has financial POA over stepdad as they will likely drain their accounts and leave nothing for your moms needs", "NTA.  A friend of mine went through something similar with her elderly mother, who had remarried after the death of her husband.  The second husband was a big man and the mother was a tiny, frail little woman.  The husband kept falling and his adult children (in another state) couldn't understand that the wife couldn't get the husband up off the floor and was calling the fire department several times a week for help.  My friend finally said, \"Enough is enough.\"  She moved her mother back to her home state and notified the husband's children that they were now in charge.  The mother was relieved to be in a safe place because she wasn't well enough to be a full time caregiver.", "NTA, you are helping your mom, as you should.", "Nta", "NTA not your problem and not fair on your mother", "CORRECTION: hospice is the opposite of what you say. Care provided based on the diagnosis of death within six months.", "My favorite piece of advice I shared with mom she she had a chuckle", "This comment should be higher, just in case!", "I suspect it's the fact that your mom is there, and therefore easier to threaten/bully than the absent children who actually have the responsibility to care for the problem. In a lot of cases, social workers are overworked and dealing with limited resources--which is not an excuse to try to hold another medically fragile adult responsible."]}
