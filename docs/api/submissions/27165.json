I don\u2019t have any sisters so I decided my maid of honor would be my longtime best friend \u201cSarah\u201d. I\u2019ve been engaged for over a year and Sarah was so excited to help with wedding planning and cried when I asked her to be MOH. I\u2019ve been planning to put her in a different shade of dress than my other bridesmaids so she could stand out. She already got her dress but my other bridesmaids didn\u2019t.\n\nRecently, Sarah\u2019s sister \u201cJess\u201d announced she\u2019s pregnant and due a week after my wedding. Sarah and her family are understandably extremely excited as this is her first niece/nephew. I\u2019m excited for them! They live locally and are a close family. Sarah told me in a casual way that Jess will likely be induced a week early due to a history of medical conditions and since my wedding is on a Friday and her doctor doesn\u2019t usually do inductions on weekends, the birth could very well fall on my wedding day. Then she told me that, if that happens, she\u2019ll have to attend the birth and not my wedding. She probably won\u2019t be allowed in the delivery room as her sister is allowed two support people per hospital policy and will have her husband and mom, but Jess told her if they\u2019d allow a third person, she\u2019d be happy to have Sarah there as well, so now Sarah wants to camp out at the hospital in case that happened. I asked her if she\u2019d consider just coming for my ceremony even if the birth fell on that day and she very firmly said no, she\u2019s staying at the hospital even if she\u2019s just in the waiting room. Then she laughed and said \u201chonestly, even if the baby is born before, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be up to attending a wedding\u201d because she won\u2019t want to leave the baby. I know her and Jess are close, but I doubt they\u2019ll want her there the whole time. But that\u2019s none of my business.\n\nI really want a maid of honor so I\u2019m thinking of asking Sarah to be a bridesmaid and putting my other friend as MOH. That way, if Sarah doesn\u2019t attend I can still have a MOH. I know Sarah already paid for the dress so I would insist on paying for the new one. I broached it gently and she seemed really hurt so I ended the conversation but I\u2019m thinking of bringing it up again. She says I don\u2019t understand because I\u2019m an only child and won\u2019t be an aunt, which stung. I\u2019m not trying to be unreasonable and I get that babies are exciting. I\u2019m excited for her. And if her sister just happened to go into labor, I\u2019d honestly probably be understanding. But it just feels like she\u2019s planning not to attend my wedding. \n\nI\u2019m trying to be understanding; I don\u2019t want to be a bridezilla. But this really hurts me. I know my wedding isn\u2019t as important to everyone else as it is to me and I know that family comes first.

I know she's excited to become an aunt but she will be spending little time at the hospital and also likely not at the house at the beginning.   The new mom & dad will want their own time with baby and mom will want to rest.  Neither will want to be having a line of visitors hanging out.  I think Sarah definitely has time to be in the wedding but since she is choosing to likely not be available, adios!", "NTA. \n\nI understand that you want a maid of honour, and don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for swapping in this situation. \n\nI also don\u2019t think Sarah is an AH for attending the birth over your wedding, but I think her \u201cwon\u2019t be an aunt\u201d comment was cruel and unnecessary. \n\nAlso, if your fianc\u00e9e has any siblings, their children will be your nieces and nephews, so you can definitely still be an aunt!", "NTA.  It\u2019s your wedding and if you want a MOH, then you should have one.  Sarah said even if the baby is born before your wedding day, she might not even \u201cbe up to attending a wedding\u201d.  I find this a bit weird.  It\u2019s not like SHE is having a baby.  Does she really need to be with her sister and the baby 24/7?  \n\nSo you have like a 50/50 chance of her even showing up (less in my opinion).   I would do the same thing you\u2019re doing.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe has TOLD you she has other priorities. YOu are just reacting to that.", "NTA. Sarah should have volunteered to step down on her own.", "NTA \n\nChange your MOH, OP. \n\nShe\u2019s the one that\u2019s incredibly unreasonable. She can\u2019t fulfill two roles at once so she will have to sacrifice one role over the other.", "Approach it as-you hear what she\u2019s saying and you respect that and will release her as MOH. Tell her the birth of her sister\u2019s baby is as important to her as your wedding is to you, and both need to be respected. She can\u2019t tell you she most likely won\u2019t be there and yet expect you to hold the spot. Nope. Don\u2019t let her talk down to you either. She seems kind of self righteous about having a sister and you don\u2019t. NTA", "NTA. As long as you're respectful in allowing her to make her priorities and see no reason why you should not be allowed a MOH just because your friend might prioritize something else. If MOH is a function that is important to you you pick someone who will prioritize the wedding. One thing you could consider is to have two MOHs. That way you don't need to \"demote\" anyone and worst case you have to people cheering you on. That also helps with the dress situation.", "NTA \n\nYou are offering to pay for her dress. It is very resonable if there is a high chance she will not be able to attend\n\nI wonder if Sarah is normally somewhat insensitive? But I dont blame you for being disappointed by her behavior. Its odd she wasnt more apologetic that theres a high chance she couldnt be there for such an important day!", "NTA- Ultimately, providing peace of mind is the most important role of a MOH.  If choosing someone else who is more likely to attend your wedding is what gives you the most peace of mind, then go for it. Sarah can respect your decisions as much as you respect hers and she can still have fun with you as a bridesmaid if she wishes.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t angry with her. You understand that she might not be there, but she should understand that you need someone to step into that role who *can* be there. She\u2019s a huge AH for saying you can\u2019t understand because you\u2019ll never be an aunt. You do understand, which is why you\u2019re not angry with her in the first place.", "NTA and frankly, Sarah is being a terrible friend. *She* should have been the one to come to *you* and tell you to consider another MOH. Not cool, Sarah.", "NTA. She can\u2019t have it both ways and made it clear she\u2019d choose the baby over the wedding. As someone with a sister, she should understand how important a reliable MOH is on the wedding day.", "NTA. How can she be MOH when she won\u2019t be at the wedding?", "She technically uninvited herself, just make her a guest and let know and set yourself free so any stress, she truly has her own priorities and do do you, that\u2019s how friendship works, if you can\u2019t be there , step aside and let others provide support without being entitled. She might hurt now, but you will hurt more your wedding day,", "NTA  \nOn one hand, I wonder what the \"jobs\" of your MOH would be, (bridal shower, etc) and therefore what will be incomplete if she doesn't show up? It sounds like there's a different outfit involved, but if you replaced her at the last minute everyone would match, so what's the big deal? The MOH gets an extra fancy corsage, done.  \nBut assuming your account of her attitude is accurate, it sounds like she doesn't care about your feelings regarding your special day. She's free to prioritize her niece's birth, but she should show some empathy for the situation she's leaving in your lap. Maybe this is not serious enough to consider dumping the whole friendship (no judgment here if that happened), but demoting her sounds reasonable.", "Nta", "NTA. You want a maid of honor, she can't guarantee she can fulfill the role. I would kindly explain you understand her commitment to her sister so you're going to create another plan to accommodate her desire for the birth and yours for your wedding. \n\nBtw, they totally can and do induce on weekends. I was induced on Saturday nights with all my children. They had the thought \"I would sleep while it was starting\". Lol joke was on them, my kids are stubborn and made it hard from the start of induction!", "nta, and without apologizing for it, just tell her again. No apology because you are doing nothing wrong at all. She is by flaking on her maid of honor duties and then putting up a fuss about you finding a different one. Just say: Since you told me it is looking like you can't attend my wedding due to the birth in your family, I have no choice but to have someone else be my moh. This is for the best, since you can now plan to be there without worrying about not being able to attend my wedding! I understand why you want to be with your family, and I'm not going to stand in the way of you seeing the birth of your niece.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily even keep her as a bridesmaid honestly at this point. You have to shift around the groomsmen too, so who is going to step up to fill the spot? She can still wear her dress if she attends, as the best friend of the bride - just not as a bridal party member.", "NTA, you are being understanding. What are you supposed to do? Your MOH has flat out told you she will skip your wedding if her sister is having her baby. She will miss if her sister has already had the baby.", "NTA. Sarah has already made it clear she will choose multiple hypothetical situations over your wedding. You seem to be relatively ok with that which is great. There are a lot of variable with babies being born: time, date, false labor, bed rest, length of labor, health of mom & baby to name a few. Your wedding will be happening at a specific date & time, no such variables. If she can\u2019t commit to being there, that\u2019s your answer. Let her know that you understand how important her sister and the baby are to her and you want her to be able to focus on that without worrying about your wedding. If it were my I wouldn\u2019t even have her be in the wedding party at all, I would ask her to come as a guest. Buying a dress, shoes, jewelry, paying for hair & makeup that she might not even be there for seems useless to me. But that part is obviously up to you and how ok you are with calling an audible the day of, if needed. It\u2019s not fair to you or the rest of the wedding party to wait and see if Sarah will grace you with her presence on the day. She has let you know implicitly where her priorities lie which is absolutely fine, that\u2019s her decision to make. But she doesn\u2019t get to expect you to bend over backwards to keep her as the MOH. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with this and I wish you all the best.", "Sarah has informed you that her new niece or nephew takes priority over your wedding. Move forward with the assumption that she won\u2019t be there for your wedding. If she gets upset, that\u2019s on her.", "NTA your maid of honour is supposed to be someone who will be there for you on your wedding day. That\u2019s the bare minimum of the role. And your friend is telling you she won\u2019t do that. Her sister is booking a planned induction so it\u2019s not like she\u2019s telling you it\u2019s a low probability if if, she is telling you she is planning to not be there. If she doesn\u2019t want to do the bare minimum, get someone else who will.", "NTA, but I\u2019d also suggest you could consider two maids of honor? My cousin did something like that - he sister was Maid of Honor and her best friend (already married) was Matron of Honor. Weddings can be what we make of them.", "NTA. She can\u2019t have her wedding cake and eat it too.", "NTA - I really do not understand this trend of extended family being around for the birth of a baby. When my children were born, our families lived 800 miles away. We sent them pictures, and they were very excited. Maybe I'm in the wrong, but not sure what Sarah has to do at the hospital so she has to miss the wedding.", "NTA. She however, is a massive AH. \n\nIt\u2019s your one big day and she\u2019s supposed to be your best friend, and frankly I think it\u2019s fucking weird she wants to attend a birth at all or that her partner is okay with the wife\u2019s sister attending as 3rd person over his own parents anyway. \n\nWhen my future wife gives birth, there\u2019s no way I\u2019d have anyone else there; that\u2019s a special moment for me and my future wife, and she will undoubtedly need rest, and want time with the baby. No parents. No siblings.  They can meet them a few days later. I also wouldn\u2019t want to attend the birth of any future niece or nephews. That\u2019s just really odd. \n\nThere is no way she should prioritise the birth of a niece or nephew over your wedding; she can meet them the next day and it will make no difference to anyone; you can\u2019t just move your wedding", "Ordinarily I would say this is very rude of you. But, she indicated she might not be available, so you have no option but to use someone else in that role.\n\nNTA", "NAH I think its a very very reasonable request and if I were her I would also ask if you would like me to step aside.", "Wow. She's a moron. Dump her.", "i mean, it's your wedding and you can do whatever you want but is it really that big of a deal to keep her as the MOH and if she doesn't show up, just have an \"honorary\" MOH perform any duties she would be doing on your wedding day?  why \"demote\" her?  why not just be a supportive friend?  even if you move her from MOH to a bridesmaid, and she isn't able to be there, you're still going to be out one body, so you could have one of your bridesmaids stand in for her, or maybe respectfully keep her position open in her honor.   you're making it seem like the position of MOH is more important than having your best friend at your wedding.  you're a little bit of an AH.", "if she doesn\u2019t show up just tell everyone that your MOH is attending the birth of her niece/nephew. trust me no one cares whether your MOH is there or not. it\u2019s your day, it won\u2019t make or break it.", "I guess the question all comes down to what\u2019s ultimately more important to you - the vision you have of your wedding day or maintaining a friendship? You can certainly push her on this and make a big deal about demoting her or you can ask another of your bridesmaids to step up on the day of if she can\u2019t make it. No, they won\u2019t have a special MOH dress, but no one will know and there won\u2019t be any hurt feelings. You could also just buy an emergency MOH dress, since you were willing to pay for a new dress for her anyways.\n\nIt sounds like her sister has a lot of health complications and the birth could be high risk, so even if your friend wasn\u2019t in the room, she\u2019d be worried about her sister the entire time.\n\nI\u2019m not saying your friend was kind in how she responded, but just as you\u2019re hurt you feel like she\u2019s not prioritizing you, it sounds like she\u2019s equally hurt you seem more concerned with how your day looks than maintaining a long time friendship.\n\nYWBTA, more to yourself, if you burned a bridge over something that didn\u2019t need to be this complicated. People miss weddings for things like births and deaths all the time, and yeah it sucks to possibly not have your best friend there, but it would suck way more to lose a friend forever over one day, especially when it sounds like she\u2019s helped you plan and has been supportive up until this announcement.", "[deleted]", "ESH\n\nHonestly don\u2019t know why this is an issue.  If she can show up, great.  If she can\u2019t, make sure in advance your other friend agrees to step into the role of MOH.  And perform whatever duties are needed on the actual wedding day.  If the issue is simply the dress, I\u2019m sure you can come up with a creative way  (a sash? A bouquet?  A particular item of jewelry) to visually signify who is fulfilling the role of MOH.  You can even use the circumstance as a way to joyously celebrate your friend from afar.", "I mean I personally think you're being a jerk. The whole point of the wedding is to invite and include people we care about, that we want there, to share in the happiness of the day.\n\nYou're treating this more like a job. An unpaid one where people use their own time, money and energy to cater to you. \n\nRealistically if she was still the bridesmaid and she did have to miss, what is literally the worst thing that would happen? It isn't like your legal officiant not showing up.\n\nIf I was your \"best friend\", I'd tell you to forget it, I'll just plan on not attending.\n\nYTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I can see how your friend would be hurt to be asked to step down but she also cannot/will not fully commit to the wedding day now. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s truly a reasonable way to have a backup plan because births happen when they happen and no one knows until the day of the wedding who will be where. That\u2019s a lot of last minute chaos. She\u2019s choosing her family and that\u2019s fair. She can\u2019t do that and expect to \u201cmaybe\u201d your wedding day for another 6-7 months.", "NTA. She needs to realize the wisdom of what you're proposing. You should at least have another bridesmaid ready to step in on the day.", "NTA. Could I offer an alternative? I personally didn\u2019t have anyone as my MOH, but my friend had 3 girls as her MOHs together. Could you keep her ceremoniously and maybe just ask another friend to be her co-MOH? That way she still has the title if she\u2019s able to come, but you\u2019re not left without anyone to fill the role.", "So does Sarah think that your future husbands siblings (if he has any) won\u2019t let you be an aunt to their children? I have 5 nephews & 1 niece and only one of them is blood related - but I would willingly go to prison for all 6.  \ud83d\ude02 \n\nBeing a MOH is a big deal (not for everyone but for the majority of people), & I understand why she\u2019s upset about being demoted, but she already made it clear that she will bail. A missing bridesmaid is a lot easier to deal with than a missing MOH. If someone else is going to have to run around and do all the day of duties of a MOH, they should get the title too. \n\nNTA - you\u2019re being logical.", "NTA.  In simplest terms, she has told you she can not be counted on to attend your wedding.  Her words, not hours.  Be a little stronger.  She has said she likely won't be there and thinks it is funny to leave you in the lurch so yes, she should have the common sense to back out.  Can her.

The bride always has a lot going on, and the moh provides interference. Focuses just on the bride and makes sure she's drinking water and has a snack and holds the dress so the brdie can pee.

She obviously can't do that if she is with her sister. Sarah is faced with needing to be in two places at once as she understandably wants to support her sister.  She either has to bend the laws of physics or be honest about what she will do if the baby makes its appearance on your wedding day. She has clearly chosen to involve herself in the birth and be with her sister. \n\nGiven that, I don't think Sarah can be MOH. Don't see it as demoting her. You are just being practical, dealing with the logistics when two important events happen at the same time. Obviously,  your wedding is YOUR important event and you need a MOH you can rely on. Sarah is quite focused on her sister's important event. I'd say, given Sarah's totally understandable desire to support her sister, you've decided that you yourself need the support of a MOH who will be less distracted and who can 100% be there for you.

You wouldn\u2019t even be unreasonable if you asked Sarah to step back completely from being in the wedding party. \n\nOne compromise is for Sarah to act as your MOH up to the wedding or be included in all activities but then for her to attend as a guest. That\u2019s seems fair since she won\u2019t commit to attending the service & seems likely to miss the whole day. \n\nSarah has handled this situation very insensitively and selfishly. She doesn\u2019t want to give anything up but she\u2019s not willing to fully support you. \n\nYou might want to handle this as though MOH were a position you were filling and write up a description of what you expect from a MOH. (Or take it from a wedding guide or site.) if she doesn\u2019t meet the basic duties (attending the wedding) she cannot be your MOH.", "Ok, you\u2019re NTA, but Sarah needs to do research on labor and I would encourage you to tell her to do that research before you demote her. \n\n1) If her sister is going to be induced (first off, that\u2019s a decision that won\u2019t be made until 30+ weeks, they won\u2019t be scheduled until a week or two before anyway) it will probably take days to give birth (I was quoted as a 2 day induction at 38weeks) Even if she isn\u2019t induced, labor is a marathon, not a sprint. Nothing important happens until you\u2019re pushing, which is like the last step. \n\n2) if her sister gets induced, she needs to find out if they do a night induction or early morning inductions. If the hospital does night inductions, they don\u2019t do inductions on Friday/Saturday. If it\u2019s morning inductions, then it would no inductions on Saturday/Sunday. Plus there\u2019s no guarantee that they\u2019ll have room for the induction when it\u2019s scheduled. You have to call an hour beforehand to see if it\u2019s ok for you to go in at the scheduled time.", "NTA. What exactly does Sarah expect you to do? Not have a MOH. She has made it clear she will not attend your wedding. Buy the dress from her and give to someone else. You understood her position, she has to understand yours. She is T A for her comments and making you feel guilty for looking for alternatives.", "NTA. You seem very understanding that she can\u2019t make your wedding a priority, and your making adjustments to ensure you have the support you need during your special event. \n\nShe\u2019s the asshole for her behaviour. Not the boy being able to attend part. That\u2019s understandable. The insults about being an only child. U you ou as an only child have recognized that she may need to be elsewhere and have made a plan to accommodate that, she however a person with siblings is having a hissy fit over the fact you are prioritizing what you need instead of just accepting that she won\u2019t be there. \n\nOP this woman has told you she will not be attending. If the baby is born and she e can\u2019t even go in the delivery room, she going to bailout, if the the baby is born before the wedding she\u2019s going to bail out. \n\nIf I were you I wouldn\u2019t just demote her to bridesmaid, I demote her to guest, because she is not coming. \n\nLet her Kiowa there aren\u2019t any hard feelings but it\u2019s not reasonable that you don\u2019t whether or not your maid of honour will be in attendance at your wedding. It\u2019s a big job and you require support. If she commits and doesn\u2019t show up it would have a negative impact on your friendship. So it\u2019s best that she not be in the wedding party in case she can\u2019t make it.", "NTA. Another option though is to have two maids of honor since the likelihood she won't attend seems incredibly high.", "I think Sarah is an AH, both for that remark and a bit for camping out in the waiting room on the not-gonna-happen chance that the hospital changes its policy and allows her into the room as a third support person. WTF is that nonsense? Not to mention her not wanting to promise to be there for OP's wedding, but not being willing to step down either.\n\nOP is NTA, but really should just kick Sarah out of the bridal party entirely.", "I agree. Sarah is saying that she is 99% not going to be at the wedding, but she wants to be MOH anyway. Ridiculous", "Not only can't she fulfil both roles, she's already told OP that the birth is her priority... even if she doesn't have anything to do, the has decided to effectively abandon her MoH duties.", "Agreed, add a second MOH. I have a SIL and 2 best friends that I'm equally close too. I basically said they were all 3 my MOH. They came up together to give the MOH speech and each took a turn. No one had an issue with it. Having a \"Maid of Honor\" and \"Matron of Honor\" is also common enough as well. \n\nIt's your wedding, make your own rules! If your friend can make it, great! If not, then you have someone else trusted to be a part of your big day.", "Thats a great idea \n\nA little unconventional but sweet", "Maid of honour where I live usually signs your marriage certificate and gives what is supposed to be a nice and heartwarming speech about the bride. So while those aren\u2019t jobs somebody else couldn\u2019t do, they are things that often have to be done. In addition to the job of supporting you and being excited for you on your big day.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about what others think, it\u2019s that she specifically cares about having a MOH", "It\u2019s not about other people caring.", "*OP* wants a MOH who will be at her wedding; she's not concerned about what the guests will think if the MOH isn't there.", "Where did she act like she committed some kind of terrible sin? To me it reads more like accepting the very good possibility of her friend not being there and adjusting accordingly, she isn\u2019t uninviting her from the wedding obviously, if she manages to be there she\u2019s still be a bridesmaid.", "Wow this is an extreme outtake. The bride is the one that\u2019s trying to acquiesce her friend here not the other way around.", "Frankly I see it as the exact opposite.  As the wedding gets closer she will not preoccupied with timing/missing the wedding or the birth.  The bride is being really open to doing the best for her friend. \n\nDefinitely NTA", "Isn\u2019t the actual role of a MOH a job? It\u2019s to be there with the bride and help her throughout the day and plan bachelorette etc. so yes it is a job that she now can\u2019t fulfill and will be in need of a person to fill it if Sarah leaves", "Two non-medially needed people is *plenty* in a delivery room, there's basically no chance Sarah is getting into the delivery room. Also:\n\n>Then she laughed and said \u201chonestly, even if the baby is born before, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be up to attending a wedding\u201d because she won\u2019t want to leave the baby. I know her and Jess are close, but I doubt they\u2019ll want her there the whole time.\n\nI am an aunt, and I'm pretty close with my sister, and Sarah is pretty delusional here. I know births seem to be done differently in America than where I'm from (pretty much only one other non-medical person (ie, the dad) is ever in the room in any birthing story I've heard from friends and family), but her sister will have just given birth, she and her husband will want to be alone with the baby once introductions have been made. She needs to realise this is her sister's baby, not hers.\n\nAlso, definitely, at the very least she can't be MOH - she's choosing to miss your wedding in order to wait outside the delivery room. If she'd said \"My sister may be induced on your wedding day, and I will have to be contactable in case something goes wrong\", totally fine! But this is a different story.", "I had a Maid of Honor & Matron of Honor.  Worked great.", "So be it. \n\nIf I was OP I'd tell them I hope they can be there but I understand if she can't be.", "No she isn't.", "Yup. An unpaid, thankless job.", "This baby is quite a ways off, too! Jess (and husband) may very well decide they don't even want her mom there or that they don't want anyone to visit for the first few weeks while they adjust and so on.", "But that\u2019s what op did? She hopes her friend will be there but understands family comes first. Since the friend clearly stated that there is a very good chance she won\u2019t be attending at all, even if the baby is born before the wedding, op wants somebody who\u2019ll be there 100% as MOH, but her friend is still welcome to be a bridesmaid.\n\nEdit: Just out of curiosity u/Jizz-Bird, did you block me? Because the only interaction I\u2019ve had with you is this comment, which sounded fairly normal to me, but now I can\u2019t seem to be able to interact with you or any other comment in this thread. Only thing I can do is edit this one. Oh well. Hope I didn\u2019t offend you with my comment, it wasn\u2019t my intention.", "Or even just don't want visitors until they're home from the hospital. I got to visit some of my niblings in the hospital, but it was very dependent on if the new mum was feeling up to it. Giving birth is a major thing! Not everybody feels up to visitors immediately, and that's ok."]}
