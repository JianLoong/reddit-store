They are generally very nice people and we share mutual respect. The New Girl started roughly 6 months ago now, and we've had an incident or two (most notably the 'I ate your homemade food but here's money so you can go buy some fast food') but mostly it's been decent.\n\nUntil recently.\n\nI'm a veterinarian, and I'm passionate about caring for my patients (and clients, but mostly patients). I take cases home to research after hours, stay late, make check-up calls on weekends, the works. I have little tolerance for people who put the opinion of their breeder/pet food check out clerk/etc before a vet's.\n\nSo I recently had a cat patient with an issue that was fixable with some particular food and short-term medication. All went well in the exam, I gave the client the meds and walked them up to the front desk whilst going over the home care instructions. Handed them off to the receptionist, said goodbye, walked into the back.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, my receptionist pulled me aside and said New Girl had gone to the client after I left and told them that they didn't need to follow my instruction, that all they needed to do was go to the pet store and get X food and Y supplement and the cat would be perfectly fine, no need to spend all that money at the vet's.\n\nY'all, I saw red.\n\nI found New Girl and took her into my office. I asked if she had talked to the client, and she said she had. I asked what about. She said 'just home care stuff'. I asked if that included recommending to ignore my instructions and instead follow her suggestions 'to save money'. She had a look like Bambi had just discovered what cars look like going 80 mph whilst in the middle of I-5. She stammered, with no actual words coming out.\n\nI tried so hard to be professional. I told her this was unacceptable, that Dr Google does not qualify as veterinary education, and that she as an assistant had no business AT ALL making recommendations that contradict the vet's directions. I didn't yell at her, but apparently my voice did rise. I told her I'd be reporting her to management, and if she did it again I'd see she was fired.\n\nShe fled the office, apparently locked herself in the bathroom and cried, and now I have my manager telling me she's talking hostile work environment. Manager thinks I overstepped a smidge (her words), I think she's lucky I didn't flay her skin off for potentially endangering my patient.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1674090919, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10fodi8/aita_for_dressing_down_an_assistant_who_told_a/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She not only put the pet\u2019s health at risk which in turn puts the business at risk, but also cost the business money immediately. I would address it with as high up as you can asap.", "NTA. How is this a hostile work environment? She could've gotten a pet killed, and that would've reflected badly on your entire office.", "NTA\n\nAs an animal lover, I am 100% on your side and am glad that you said what you did. As a manager, this could have been handled in a way that wouldn't have gotten you in trouble and would have given you more weight to request her termination. However, because she felt threatened, she has that to hold against the clinic. Now, being a manager, I also know that what you described is NOT a hostile work environment. Managers/HR typically get terrified of these claims and back down and most people that are problematic in the workplace know this and use it to their advantage.\n\nA better way to have handled this would have been to ask her what she told the client and told her to never do that again and document the response. Then go to the manager and express your very valid concern. This person is a liability to the clinic and should not be employed there.", "NTA - you went to school are were taught and trained how to care for your little furry patients in the best way possible.\n\nHow dare some store clerk tell your customer to ignore your prescription!  Even more, what kind of dumb ass pet owner will throw the Drs instructions to the wind, because some clerk said to?\n\nShe\u2019s luckily you didn\u2019t insist on her being fired on the spot!", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nShe is NOT a veterinarian. She had zero business in dishing out medical advice of any kind. Her advice could have harmed an animal. \n\nYou did this correctly, too: praise in public, criticize in private. Her reaction was over the top; she knew she was in the wrong. \n\nWho is this \u201cmanager\u201d? Is that person also a veterinarian, or someone who manages the office functions? Regardless, you were in the right. Fully. Her claiming hostile work environment is BS and she knows it.", "As a nurse, I believe she practiced medicine without a license and should have been terminated on the spot. I would not let her back in the door.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA. I would fire someone for this.", "NTA.  If you are a veterinarian, I presume you are the boss, and the manager AND New Girl both work for you.  All decisions, and all advice to clients, are within your purview, as a professional who studied and worked a lot of years to achieve that distinction.   I agree with the other commentators who feel this is a fireable offense. By the way, I don't know what country you reside, but I can't believe a legal cause of action exists for a non-professional who undercuts a professional's medical advice.  I think you need to make it clear to your manager how things work, as well.", "NTA. Manager needs to get statements from everyone involved and fire her ASAP. She's a liability. Had the owner listened to her and the pet gotten sicker or even died, your office would be on the hook. She should have been gone right then no second chance.", "NTA, and that manager should be lucky you did not INSIST she be fired.", "NTA.  I can\u2019t understand why anyone would argue otherwise.  This is literally a life or death situation.", "Not in the least. That person needs to be fired at once!", "NTA she acted against the interest of her employer and got caught.", "That was a straight up fireable offense. NTA", "NTA but if your manager is looking to mediate this then you either accept that your workplace doesn\u2019t agree that this was an acceptable way to deal with it or work elsewhere. Thinking that an employee is \u201clucky\u201d you didn\u2019t do worse in your dressing down isn\u2019t a helpful strategy, even when the risk here was high.", "NTA. Ignoring your advice could've wound up costing the client more anyway, Only financially if they were lucky. New Girl should not have undermined you like that and what she did was incredibly disrespectful, not to mention dangerous for your patient.", "NTA. I would have gotten her fired after that one alone.", "NTA, but you don\u2019t give an employee that dumb and that irresponsible a second chance. Not when they\u2019re endangering the lives of your pet clients. The only thing that\u2019s going to come of keeping her around is her stirring up trouble to get back and you. Oh, and she\u2019s not going to stop undermining you and going behind your back with clients, either.", "op=NTA\n\nto be honest, That would be a fireable offense to me.    \nIf a Nurse's aide told a patient to not bother with insulin but just buy some homeopathic remedy as it's cheaper--would that be a fireable offense?  This is much the same.", "NTA\n\nAre you sure this is the first time she did it? It may be the first time she got caught. In this situation I believe there's no second chances. If she's not fired she's going to do it again.", "Info: Are you New Girls direct supervisor?\n\nEdit: or in her supervisory chain?", "Are you justified? Yes. But this is a professional work environment, you did overstep if your voice rose. However, she did need to be humbled.

If management lets this go, then every patient in the future will be at risk. She will undercut your professional opinion again.

She\u2019s lucky you didn\u2019t kick her ass out immediately.", "NTA.  She put an animal at risk!  Not only is she advocating advice that goes against what you, the veterinarian prescribed, she is also telling your clients to save money by not bringing their pets to a veterinarian.  Does she not realize that in addition to putting an animal at risk, if she keeps doing this, she could cost the practice money.  Tell that to your boss and see how hostile the work place can really be.", "I guess vet care isn't like human health care because *operating outside of your scope of practice* on the human side will get all your credentials pulled, and rightfully so!\nIf this is also illegal on the animal side of health care, you might want to make a call to your local licensing board.", "NTA\n\nIf being told not to overstep in your job is a \u2018hostile work environment\u2019, perhaps she should try NOT overstepping in her job.\n\nAsk your manager how you could have handled that differently while ensuring the safety of the animals that you care for.", "NTA at all. Good for you for taking your profession so seriously.", "I wasn't there and I was thinking n t a until your last sentence saying \"she's lucky I didn't fray her skin off\". \n\nIf you were that angry you definitely yelled at her and not just \"raised your voice\". Yea what she did was wrong but she's an employee not your child\n\nSlight YTA", "I'm borderline ESH and YTA. She 100% was out of line, but it definitely sounds like you could have handled it better. Especially if it got so bad that shes saying it's a hostile work environment. I know often when we see red we dont really realize how harshly we come across, even looking back on it. \n\nI absolutely understand why you would have gotten pissed off and she should be out of a job. But sounds like you were out of line and acted before you had calmed down and could act rationally.", "ESH because you seem very full of yourself and could have handled this differently. NG obviously shouldn\u2019t contradict someone with more qualifications than her, but if you would have to report her to management to get her fired, you\u2019re not the boss so don\u2019t act like you are.", "I'll be honest it's a fine line but to me it sounds like you were audible to other people which means you probably yelled at her a little. The girl was an asshole but punishing unprofessionalism with unprofessionalism is pretty hypocritical so now you're both assholes.", "I don\u2019t understand it at all, she put the entire practice at risk, even aside from the patient.  I would have her blacklisted with every veterinarian in town.", "She literally put an animal at risk of bodily harm or death, if the issue was that severe.\n\nI can't even imagine what would bring someone to do something so stupid.", "Not just reflected badly on office, but possible malpractice suit?", ">How is this a hostile work environment?\n\nI-5 means OP is in CA, OR, or WA. I don't know anything about the latter two, but in CA she might have just enough grounds to *file* a complaint (either with HR or with the state). Even if she doesn't file a complaint, she has indicated that she's considering filing a complaint.\n\nBased on my (very incomplete) understanding of these things, it's possible that the assistant is now legally protected from retaliation. So if OP wants to fire her (or demote her??) the onus would be on her to prove that is *isn't* retaliation. Since it doesn't seem like there was a paper trail of problems up to this point, it's hard to prove it's not retaliation.\n\nSo OP might be in a difficult spot here.", "Owner may have listened, we don't know(unless there was comment)", "It doesn't matter.  This would be the same as a receptionist in a doctor's office telling a patient not to take medically necessary medication, and changing a diet to get rid of an illness.  It's not acceptable, and could potentially cause more harm to the patient upto, and including death.  That could easily turning into a lawsuit.  Undermining a medical professional, be it human or animal is never ok.  In my opinion she should be fired.  When my mom was a practicing Veterinarian, a receptionost was fired for doing just what this girl did.", "All of the staff report to the attending vet overseeing the practice for the day, and the vet reports to the owner (also a vet) as the ultimate authorite.", "What?  Do you have any pets or human friends? Just curious. Technically, the receptionist was exposing the Vet practice  to a malpractice lawsuit as she was providing  unqualified  medical advice. NTA", "Right!! It would have been one thing if she took the things she found to OP. OP could have had a teaching moment with her. But to go directly to the client she makes OP look like a greedy vet who only cared about making $$. I hope this girl gets fired. She brought down the entire practice.", "I'm not familiar with the normal hierarchy in a vet's office.  In some places, admin staff are under the supervision of an office manager.  If that were the case, it would have been appropriate to take the issue to the office manager to handle as the offender is not in the vet's \"department\" so to speak.", "NTA.  You were her supervisor, she screwed up and you dealt with it."]}
