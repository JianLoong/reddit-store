My SIL has a job that gives her enough income for her to live comfortably and she's supposed to be saving some to get a new pace while living with us.\n\nWell last week my SIL heard my eldest son talking to his mother and I about what chores he can do to earn $75 and she asked us if we actually gave our children that much money and that it was to much money for children to have and we told her they were our children we could give them however much we see fit to give them.\n\nI thought she dropped it but i was wrong. Last night my youngest son came to me and told me that his aunt had demanded he give her $40 from his money so she could go buy something, when he told her no she apparently started screaming at him that he was an ungrateful brat and tried to grab his wallet and take the money. Immediately I went to my two older children and asked them if she had ever asked or told them to give her money to which my daughter responded that her aunt had asked her a couple weeks beforehand if she could have $50 and my son told me that she had asked but he always shut her down immediately telling her he was saving for a car. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter hearing this I went to SIL and told her to get her stuff and get out of my house and that she was no longer allowed in it if she thinks it is ok to steal money from my kids, yell at my kids, and call them mean names.  My wife thinks i went about it the wrong way but that  was overall right, but her family thinks i was an AH for kicking her out and refusing to allow her in and said that my children should've just given her the money because \"family helps family\". \n\nSo AITA for Telling my SIL she's no longer allowed at my house when she told my children to give her money?", "created_utc": 1673643972, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10b5jqg/aita_for_telling_my_sil_shes_no_longer_allowed_in/", "score": 278, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
