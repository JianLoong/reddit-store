{"id": 13052, "submission_id": "12082ty", "title": "AITA for going on vacation without my husband?", "selftext": "My (32f) husband (35m) and I do not have children or any major responsibilities outside of bills and regular household stuff. We are a typical DINK (double income, no kids) couple with two medium-sized dogs. I\u2019m an RN and I work on average 50-60 hours a week. My husband works for a tech company and works from home full-time with periodic trips in to the office a couple times a month.\n\nI do most of the household cleaning and errand-running. I do a lot of the household chores as well, such as fixing things, making appointments, and paying bills. My husband does a lot of the dog care. Neither of our dogs need special care, they\u2019re both healthy, they mainly just need to be fed, watered, and let outside to potty in our fenced-in yard. \n\nMy husband is a homebody and does not like to go out. I can usually coax him out for dinner once a week if I\u2019m lucky, and very very rarely for dinner and a movie. The problem is this: I want to travel. I want to go see things. So a few times a year I plan a 3-4 day trip (usually just a long weekend) with a friend or my mother and we usually stay close to home. I recently went on a short trip with my mother (who I haven\u2019t seen in person for a year and a half) to a city about 3 hours away. Now, my best friend wants to plan a trip in 4 months for a 3-day trip to Florida with my nephew (her son), because I haven\u2019t seen them in almost a year. \n\nMy husband got very upset by this, and complained and pouted the entire drive home. He is now being incredibly rude, insisting that I\u2019m spending too much money and going out too frequently. I don\u2019t go out on weekends without him, I usually come straight home and spend the evenings and weekends with him after work. \n\nI plan cheap trips close to home, we are sticking to our savings plan as we are currently saving for a down payment for a home of our own. I tried explaining that I carry a lot of the work load at home, and I just need a break sometimes, not to mention we moved across country from all of my friends and family for his job. I don\u2019t get to see them if we don\u2019t plan these visits. \n\nI\u2019ve tried inviting him every time I go, but he refuses. I\u2019ve tried planning trips with him, and he insists we can\u2019t leave the dogs. I\u2019ve tried planning trips with the dogs, or finding a safe kennel option, but he adamantly refuses. I\u2019ve begged him to go places with me and he always says no, and then gets annoyed for me asking. It has been 5 years since we took a trip together, not for lack of trying on my part. I\u2019ve told him I won\u2019t be upset if he doesn\u2019t want to go, but it\u2019s not fair to me to miss out on exciting adventures because he doesn\u2019t want to leave the house or spend the money, especially when we are doing well financially and I work in a high-stress job. I feel myself getting burnt out professionally and personally. I\u2019ve tried taking a staycation several times, and I can never relax because then I\u2019m just stuck at home cooking and cleaning up after him. He insists I\u2019m the AH for leaving him to \u201ctake care of everything\u201d while he\u2019s gone. AITA for going on short vacations without my husband?\n\nEDIT 1: My main source of frustration stems from the fact that I can\u2019t even discuss travel plans with him without him getting angry and saying rude, disrespectful things to me. If he just grumbled a bit then fine, I can deal with that. But it\u2019s like living with a bomb that will unexpectedly go off.", "created_utc": 1679629574, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12082ty/aita_for_going_on_vacation_without_my_husband/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

First thing I did was plan a solo trip overseas. \n\nI want to see Ireland, France, Greece, Italy, Spain\u2026. Why in the eff would I want to spend my whole life sitting in the same house in the same city with the same person? There\u2019s a whole world out there! \n\nI\u2019ve since fallen madly in love with one of my best friends (friends for 2 years prior to our relationship starting)\u2026 we went to Breckinridge, CO to ski this winter and we\u2019re planning a Europe trip for summer. I couldn\u2019t be happier.\n\nDon\u2019t live your life in a box.

What did he do before y\u2019all got into a relationship? Was he never a self sufficient adult?\n\nNurses really are angels. I would have lost my absolute shit over him saying your leaving him to take care of everything. \n\nI think you n your husband should talk to someone to maybe help you communicate the deeper issues here of your burn out and how it could lead to resentment.", "NTA...and it doesn't really sound like he does a whole lot while he's \"working from home full time\" (why did you need to move for him to work at home?)...like you work 50-60 hours a week, then come home and do most of the cleaning and housework and he...feeds the dogs?  The division of labor is majorly off here.  And then he's petulant about you leaving and taking vacations with family when he doesn't want to go?  \n\n\nGo.  Go on all the vacations.  Let him sit his homebody ass at home and deal with it.", "NTA. Looks like it is time to move on and find someone more compatible.", "NTA. Him having to \u201cdo everything\u201d is just him cleaning up after himself and being a pet owner? If he doesn\u2019t want to go that\u2019s fine but I wouldn\u2019t let someone tie me down like that and stop being from doing solo trips.", "You say you don\u2019t have kids\u2026\u2026. \n\nNTA. But it\u2019s time to cut the apron strings.", "NTA.  One of the good qualities of a spouse is if something is important to you then it should also be important to them.  Your husband doesn't seem to care for your mental health, your enjoyment and the blessing of spending time with his wife.\n\nAll he seems to care about is the money.  What kind of relationship is this?  Something he needs to think about.", "NTA and it sounds like you know it. Are you asking so you can show him this, or because you're feeling stressed about his reaction? \nWhatever his reaction is about, it's not about you. It's about him. There is probably some precious feeling of vulnerability there for him, that he could maybe discover in therapy or via a long honest talk with you or a friend. But it sounds like he's being controlling and selfish to avoid facing his feelings. \nIt also sounds like you might need to set some boundaries around housework, if you're doing more than your fair share.", "NTA - you already say you have most the workload at home & in bills, he can survive to take care of himself and the dogs 3-4 days, he\u2019s a grown man.

Why should you be miserable because he refuses to live a little?", "Absolutely NTA. You have every right to go on holiday and take a break. We all need a break from work, family and partners. That is normal and healthy. What's not healthy is your husband's idea of what your relationship should be. He sounds controlling. You have accommodated him in every way but he's still not satisfied. He needs to take a hard look at himself and I would suggest therapy. I would consider taking a break from him. Go on your holiday, go longer if you want to! And think, is this really how you want to live the rest of your life. You deserve someone who supports you as much as you do him.", "The isolation of it all!! \n\nGoogle \u201cpartner isolation,\u201d OP. Make educated and informed decisions based on what you learn.\n\nNTA- but they REALLY should concentrate on teaching nurses the warning signs of domestic abuse.", "NTA. You have different interests and that\u2019s ok. If he doesn\u2019t want to come, that\u2019s fine. But why do you have to stay home to appease him? \nCouples have different styles and that\u2019s ok. My mother in law loves to travel and my father in law doesn\u2019t. She goes on trips and he has bachelor weeks. He loves it. If it was monthly ok maybe if you weren\u2019t spending QT but that\u2019s not fair of him to ask\u2026 \n\nTime apart isn\u2019t always a bad thing either! It\u2019s healthy to have different hobbies and interests.", "NTA at all, one should be allowed to travel, and do the things you like. A few 3-4 day trips a few times a year is ridiculously low btw. Something healthy would be 3-4 day trips every quarter and a long (7-8 days trip) every half a year. But that's subjective and coming from my own culture and norms.\n\nHe's also being very selfish because a marriage is supposed to be give and take, the fact that he will not indulge you in a single trip in 5 years is very telling what he's willing to do for you.", "NTA but it sounds like your husband is.  \n\n\nHe sounds like a real stick in the mud over something that should be very exciting for you. A good husband should support these opportunities to see the people you love and haven't seen in a long time. And if he cant handle a discussion about this without being understanding or respectful, that's a serious issue. Especially if he's blaming you for leaving things on him, given that you're the one maintaining the household more than he does. He needs to get over himself.", "NTA, he doesn't want to go with you, and you are still saving money, so I don't see a problem besides your husband trying to control your entire life. He moved you away from your family now he gets mad when you try to see them.", "NTA you don\u2019t need permission. You have your own income, no children to arrange care for, and more than that, you are an adult. You can do what you want. You\u2019ve told him your plans, so just go. In the long term, you need to think about whether you can stay with someone who not only doesn\u2019t have the same interests as you, but resents you pursuing those interests.", "NTA\n\nYou moved far from friends for his job, which is work from home?\n\nYou work hard, long hours, and he expects you to handle everything at home.  Asshole behavior on his part already.\n\nYou're planning the shortest vacations and he can't handle cleaning up after himself for 3 days?  Is he an adult?\n\nHe gets angry and seems like a \"bomb\" about to go off if you just talk about a vacation?  He's worse than a bad boss.  But you don't work for him.\n\nMake it clear this is for your mental health, it's okay you have different values, and you're clearly working modest vacays into the budget.  He can join or have his own staycay, but you will not be cleaning up after his long weekend once you return.", "NTA. \n\nAsk yourself if you want to live this way for the rest of your life.", "NTA and if it was just a case of \"I like to travel and he doesn't\" and that was that I'd say \"That's cool, go without him\". However, his attitude about your going away on short breaks without him stinks. You're both adults, it's not impacting your savings plans and you deserve to see your family and friends. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy ex is my ex partly because he simply didn't want to do anything, but also felt like I should do anything either because \"why would I want to go without him?\". I'm not talking grand plans here, I'm talking seeing live music at the local bar or heading into the city for a comedy show.", "NTA- you have invited him every time. It sounds like he is upset that you are gone and he has to clean up after himself for a few days.", "NTA\n\nGo. Travel. See the world. He can choose to come or not. Do not let him keep you from LIVING!\n\nHere's the thing. Controlling behavior like what he's exhibiting is abuse. It's not reasonable. It's not logical. It's not loving. It's not what a partner does in a healthy relationship. He wants you for himself and no one else, even to the exclusion of YOU having YOU time. That's not mentally healthy behavior in a relationship. \n\nYou can try and try and try to please him, but the only way to do that is to lose yourself. And that's not healthy for anyone. \n\nNot all abuse comes with bruises. Controlling behavior, to the point where you feel like you have to walk on eggshells to prevent him from being angry, is mental abuse. If you cannot be your authentic self when you're with your partner, you have the wrong partner. \n\nAnd come on! You work 50-60 hour weeks in healthcare, caring for other people, and then come home and do all the labor around the house?! HELL to the NO! You are not his mother, you're his wife, supposedly his life partner, his person whom he loves more than anyone. And he's treating you as though you're his caretaker.\n\nSo go on your trips.

We are here but a short time and the clock is ticking.", "NTA   Maybe want to rethink your relationship?  No one should ever dampen their potential or forgo opportunities for the sake of someone else. \nGo for it. Take that vacation and any other one you want.

Instead you are SAINT at risk of becoming a martyr, and your partner is the ahole 1000%\n\nUnless he has many incredible virtues that you didn't mention (great in bed, BDE and incredibly handsome perhaps) I can't begin to understand why you choose stay with what sounds like a truly selfish, self-centered jerk who thinks you should live your life to please him, and not take vacations so you can be the 24/7 maid and housekeeper.\n\nYou should be outraged that he places the highest priority on your dogs and thinks you are solely responsible for their care. That is why he feels right insisting you not take vacations or visit your family, because he doesn't want to be stuck taking care of them while you travel. \n\nThe things you mentioned would spell the end of most relationships, but you only seem a bit bothered. Either you are already very beat down or a saint on the verge of becoming a martyr.\n\nI just hope you aren't with him due to him being a habit that you feel would be too hard to break, because the description of your current relationship sounds utterly miserable.\n\nHonestly, you sound like a truly wonderful partner. You sound considerate, caring and giving, especially giving, because you carry a far heavier load to make things work but unlike other individuals in the same boat you do so without complaining. \n\nFor being such a wonderful partner he should cherish you and encourage you to do things that make you happy in order to compensate for his glaring failings, especially with your family.\n\nDon't give in. Do what you want to, and insist that you have no other choice, because HE REFUSES to compromise on anything and you are not going to become a mirror-image of him to make him happy.
