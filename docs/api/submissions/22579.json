This is your wedding and you are making a reasonable demand. Honestly, she is acting like a child, so she should probably not come either. \n\nI really don't understand people losing their minds when \"child free\" events requests come up. There are a myriad of things that you would not expect a child to be allowed and would be offended to see them there.

You can easily allow a newborn infant that has to be breastfed/fed, without allowing children at your wedding. This is not a child who will be over excited and running around.
