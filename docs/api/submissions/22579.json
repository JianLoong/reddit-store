So this happens to be the one special day of the middle child. Well, that clearly went against the grain of the deeply embedded psychological addiction of the family's mother, who thrived on the neediness of the youngest daughter. The mother spent the entire wedding process, from beginning of planning to arrival at events to even middle-of-the-ceremony vows, making the whole thing about the youngest daughter + grandchild.

I would be skipping this wedding too; people are being very dismissive about how hard it can be to get calories into a baby, especially since the solids at nine months are mostly exploration, not the bulk of nutrition.", "She might just live in a country where she will still be able to be on maternity leave.", "That is being smart.", "You are free to say whatever you want, that doesn't make it helpful or appropriate.", "True, but with MILs(or any other relatives) that act like this, it won't matter. MIL is playing victim here and dragging as many thru that mud as possible. It's also possible she already didn't like OP, and this is the \"final\" straw.\n\n\\*Edited: context/clarity.", "Exactly. In my opinion what the BIL said was fine, it wasn't \"don't have a baby free wedding\" just them stating what they will be doing.", "That's fine I don't really like family gatherings.", "Yes but the baby's not even born yet, I'm sure something can be worked out until the wedding. NTA.", "Agreed! I was fortunate to have 12 month mat leaves so it wasn't a huge issue, but it really limited my time away. I'm glad I did it, but so many people (including pre-baby me) don't understand how stressful it is on everyone! It wouldn't have been worth it for me to go to a wedding, even a significant family event, if I couldn't take the baby along. Luckily all our siblings welcomed their niblings to their weddings", "This. As a person with the baby in the family, grandmas on both sides immediately try to take LO and show him off to everyone. Annoys the piss out of me because 8/9 months old is the start of super clingy and stranger danger behavior.", "True and neither does what you say make it helpful or appropriate.\n\nOP and anyone who comes to this site asking for advice is free to take it or leave it.", "Me- \u201cI can\u2019t go. The stress isn\u2019t good for the baby.\u201d\nThem- \u201cWhat baby?\u201d\nMe- \u201cMe. I\u2019m the baby.\u201d", "Then the ol' \"I'm staying in to breastfeed the dog\" excuse might be for you!", "A wedding is usually a set date and you have months (sometimes years) of advance notice. It's not a surprise get-together on a random weekend where you're getting a call on Tuesday to show up Saturday for drinks.\n\nIf you can't get a sitter you're comfortable with when you have that much advance warning, just say you don't want to.", "idk, that depends on each person. I have a toddler and only ONCE i let him at his grandma's for a couple of hours.\n\nI never felt more anxious and uncomfortable like back then.\n\nMany people don't let their children until they're at least in primary school.", "Yes brilliant! Adding that to the list \ud83e\udd23", "I don't know where to start with this...\n\nOP has said the mother of the baby is willing to stay with the child during the wedding.  So no sitter is really needed anyhow (but for MIL's meltdown).\n\nSecond,  the wedding is waaaaay off.  It's plenty of time to get baby used to spending a few hours with a close friend or family member (on the non-wedding side).\n\nAs for \"many people\" not even leaving their kids with grandma for a couple of hours until primary school????  No.  The fact that you were super anxious about it is an indication that you have pretty high anxiety.\n\nI'd agree that most people don't let their kids ***overnights*** until they're older, but no one has said the wedding would require that.", "That is not this story. This bride to be sounds very reasonable. The only person being unreasonable is the MIL to be."]}
