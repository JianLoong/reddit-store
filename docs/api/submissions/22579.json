What had your BIL said about missing it?", "NTA\n\nYour not making her do anything, she's desperately trying to stick to her powerplay that makes you out to be the villain for having a simple and common(?) restriction on you and your fianc\u00e9's special day.", "NTA - at this point I\u2019d tell BIL the baby is invited and uninvite MIL haha", "Absolutely don't give in! This is the start of hopefully a wonderful, long happy life together - one that MIL does not control. Better to teach her that soon, and to see her true colours!", "Absolutely NTA.

Are you planning on having kids with this person? because this woman is not done. \n\nShe seems to be saying a lot of 'tell xyz...'. At that point in the conversation, is your partner saying 'this was my decision, not hers'?", "NTA.  Double down and talk directly to his siblings about this.  A wedding is no place for a baby.  I don't believe she's talking for the rest of the family though.", "Nope. Your wedding, your choice.", "You are NTA.  It\u2019s your wedding and your rules.  Your future MIL needs to grow the f up.

One SIL is getting married in a few months. Another is having a child in a few weeks.\n\nThe ones getting married are thinking of making it child free. The one having a child has simply let them know that if they do, they won't be able to attend, due to having a newborn.\n\nMIL has decided that the one having a child (step-child) is being disrespectful, unsupportive, has priorities wrong, etc. The one having a child isn't part of the wedding party or anything. \n\nIt's turned into this whole thing, with a lot of gossip and whispers. I hate that crap so spoke directly with the one having a child and got the actual story. It's still all up in the air, and ultimately everyone needs to do what works best for them.

Based on her words, it would be a blessing if MIL wasn't there at all.", "NTA. As someone already said, she probably wanted to parade the child around and make the event about her and baby. Also, a 8-9 month old child probably won't want to sit still and be quiet for any period of time.\n\nJust rejoice in the fact that she's giving you a Get-Out-of-Jail Free Card!

I am making the orders for seats and food this week and this way I can mark you down as a no show to the wedding and can give your space with to someone else. Have a lovely day\u201d and don\u2019t send her an invite.

It\u2019s your wedding and you can make it whatever you want. Your future MIL is being total AH though. I\u2019m glad you and your fianc\u00e9 are aligned.", "NTA. \n\nChild free weddings are not offensive in any way, and people have plenty of time to find child care OR decide that they can't make that work and will not attend. People miss weddings for all sorts of reasons- work, travel, money- and if people don't want to leave their children to attend an event, they can decline the invitation. \n\nShe is of course, being unreasonable and making this in to a big deal, and you are right not to cave, because it just affirms to her that this behavior gets her what she wants. She wants HER family to have their big day, she wants photos with the grandson, she wants this day to be the way SHE wants it. If you give in, it won't be just about this. \n\nSo, tell your fiance to reach out to his brother directly, affirm no kids, but tell him this isn't personal, brother is important to him, etc etc. Then his brother can decide what he wants to do and your fiance will have had a direct conversation, not relying on his mother for information and to twist things. \n\nThen, your fiance can let his mother know that you both are sticking with a childfree wedding, so you assume she won't be attending, and to have a nice day. Don't engage with her, and both you and your fiance should just choose not to participate in the drama. People like her feed off of it, so if you just tell her and anyone else who reaches out the same thing and then do not debate it, you take the air out of situation. You just say \"we have decided to have a childfree wedding and hopefully told people with enough notice to find childcare. We also understand some people won't be able to attend and and with any big event, some people can't make it, so we will miss them but totally understand.\" End of story.

It will be a *baby*, right? That won't remember this special event for *you two*? Seems to me like someone wants to use the baby to steal your spotlight, don't budge on this.

If this is an issue for your future BIL and his partner, that's who should be leading this charge -- not your future MIL. It sounds like your future BIL will be fine with attending the wedding & performing best man duties while baby stays home; so future MIL needs to keep her disappointment/judgement to herself. Being a little shocked that someone doesn't want kids at a major family event like a wedding is understandable, imo; but not getting bent out of shape over an rule which isn't bothering the people who are actually affected.\n\nThat said, you can't just throw up your hands and write your future MIL of as an AH unless your fiancee is already planning to go low/no contact. Try pointing out that weddings provide a lot of opportunities for informal family gatherings at times & places that are more convenient & easier for new babies & parents to attend -- and that while you & fiancee are too busy with the wedding itself, future MIL is welcome to organize a post-wedding family brunch where baby is welcome.", "NTA at all. Your mother in law wouldn't be able to come either cause it's a childless wedding and she is in fact acting like a huge child.", "NTA\n\nHad the brother said anything? He probably doesn\u2019t want to bring his baby to the wedding. Sounds like MIL just wants to show off the baby to her family and friends. \n\nDon\u2019t feel into their hysteria.

If you backed down on this, there would soon be other unreasonable demands because she would know that she could get away with them. \n\nJust out of curiosity, I am wondering how the parents of the new baby feel about this?

I know this one well. \n\nDo not give in, do not show weakness, do not allow her to get anything she wants. Ever. The second you do, it gets 10x worse. \n\nI never see my MIL due to very similar behavior and I'm totally OK with this.

By that time they're on some solids so they're not as dependent on breastmilk. There's no reason she can't attend. I even did a pump and dump at my friend's house bc - booze.", "There are these fabulous new inventions called baby bottles. Give some to FBIL and FSIL as a baby shower gift. Maybe throw in a pump if you are feeling generous.", "When we got married and had our child-free wedding, we offered to pay for a vetted, on-site sitter at our wedding so as to accommodate the family members who had a baby, and it all went swimmingly. Would that be an option? This way the baby can maintain a schedule and her parents can celebrate together.", "Is this thier first child? I never had a problem leaving my children with a trusted sitter when they were babies, but not everyone can handle it, and that's totally okay! As long as you're understanding that bro may only be available for a short time, (like ceremony only) then MIL can go kick rocks. It's not her wedding and ultimately, she's only hurting her daughter and she'll have to live with that. NTA\n\nEdit: crap, sorry. I'm dumb.  I ready this as if it was written by the groom and wife's brother is your best man. But on reflection I think it's written by bride and grooms brother is best man?

Wife can come if she wants to, and if it were me, I\u2019d be glad to have the day away!", "8-9 months???!!! Come on, you can pump and let someone watch the baby for a few hours. \n\nI think parents make the worst mistake exclusively breastfeeding. Dad's can't help feed, some babies cluster feed every couple of hours, causing you to constantly be attached to the baby, you can barely leave the house. If I did it again, I would start early with bottle feeding with milk I pumped. I feel extremely strong about this, cuz, Papa is about to be helping haha.", "Your fiance should be getting out ahead of this and contacting the members of his family he wants to attend to explain the situation. They may not be as inclined to follow MIL's lead as she wants you to believe.\n\nNTA", "Info: can you provide some further clarification? Would they have to travel for multiple days without the baby? Or is this just a day trip for them? \n\nAs someone who has breastfed babies, and done multiple weddings / business trips away from said babies while they were less than 8 months, this sounds like an odd excuse. You can absolutely pump and leaves milk/bottles with a caregiver. And the idea that SIL isn\u2019t planning on being away from baby for an evening for up to 9 months makes me sad for her", "Why is everyone so harsh on the BIL, MIL I get but if they don\u2019t want to leave their baby behind to attend they don\u2019t have to, just like OP doesn\u2019t have to invite any of the family\u2019s children.  Like that\u2019s the expectation if you have a childfree wedding that people with children may not come", "Would they need to travel for this or is it local?

Stop this shit NOW. \n\n* \"What do you MEAN, you're not giving your baby a sibling?! You can't just have one! You'll ruin his future by not letting him grow up with a brother or sister! How can any loving parent not give their kid a sibling?!\" \n* \"What do you MEAN, you're going to visit your parents this Christmas instead of coming to my house? Why do you insist on tearing my family apart with this division?!\" \n* \"What do you MEAN, you're moving 45 minutes away for a great job opportunity?! How on earth can I be expected to drive that much further to see my grandbabies; you are basically cutting a loving grandmother out of their life by making this move!\" \n* \"What do you MEAN, you don't want to display your great aunt Gertrude's massive china hutch in your living room? Doesn't family mean anything to you? She'd be rolling over in her grave if she found out you were throwing away your inheritance!\" \n\nIf she's allowed to stomp all over their wishes in this case it only empowers her to keep on nosing around and using dramatic behavior to get her way.", "I would say, ok, \"let's modify the rules. Kids are welcome, but not those that act like children. Sorry future MIL, that includes you.\"", "OP says above the baby will be 8-9 months by the time of the wedding.", "If ANYONE attempts to message it say anything repeat the above and put them on time out too.", "In an adult, I believe that behavior can sometimes be attributed to histrionic personality disorder.", "I agree. Plus, as soon as MIL said she wouldn't speak with me until I gave up to her demands I would say, \"thank you. I love the silence. With such an amazing gift feel free to not gift us anything else for our wedding.\"", "Well, the good thing is it seems like the fianc\u00e9 is standing firm and refusing to enable the tantrums. Relationships in this kind of situation can work, so long as both people involved have a strong backbone. NTA", "To be fair, the MIL is the one making these claims.   It's entirely possible that the rest of the family are just rolling their eyes over it.", "Yeah it\u2019s really weird that she is so overly obsessed with a baby who isn\u2019t even hers. Not to be dramatic, but if I were the baby\u2019s parents I\u2019d be concerned.", "In fairness if the bros wife doesn't want to leave the baby then that's fine.

I don't have kids just a dog", " It's still all up in the air, and ultimately everyone needs to do what works best for them.", "Yes! I nursed both, but sometimes you need to get away and not be a food machine. Pumping was great for a break. I'm guessing SIL is planning to be a SAHM, bc if she's going back to work she'll have to pump.", "I've dated women where I saw this all in the cards and was a real factor in deciding to end those relationships.", "She wants to be able to parade HER grandbaby around the wedding", "SIL also has family, I assume", "I assumed OP meant the BIL's wife would have family that could watch the baby as they most likely aren't invited to the wedding.", ">Also, a baby that age is eating some solids, not 100% breastfeeding. Which also makes it easier to leave the kid with someone else.\n\nNot everyone feels comfortable leaving a baby with a sitter, I understand the wedding is important, but the baby's wellbeing is first.", "Well, the future mother-in-law is suddenly available to babysit. So it all works out!", "Well, the SIL has family, so yes technically there's other family members to watch said child.", "True. Just saying that breastfeeding isn\u2019t a jail sentence like the BIL is making it out to be. Good for him for being protective of his wife, but neither of them know the reality. Lol. I hope it works out and they realize there\u2019s options. As for FMIL, yeesh. You have my sympathy", "Ah, yes her family members might be free to babysit.  I think OOP is a little too cavalier in setting forth how trivial it is to get a babysitter. Her family might not be free.  Also, 8-9 months is the prime age where babies really don't want to be with strangers, so getting a babysitter at this age is a bit of a process to get the kid used to someone new.  It's a process likely worth doing, but it's still an investment of time and money.", "Problem solved!", "And people are allowed to say they are not coming because of lack of childcare or any other reason. What you are not allowed to do is throw a tantrum like MIL is doing because of how you choose to celebrate.", "Yes.  The bride and groom aren't allowed to throw a tantrum either if people with kids whom they want too see choose not to come.", "They aren't throwing a tantrum. She stated that the brother said that his wife may not be able to attend to stay home and tend to baby and they seem fine with it. The only one throwing a tantrum is FMIL", "Doesn't seem like they are? Like at all?", "No, they aren't.  There are other stories around here where the couple is pissed because lots of people drop out of the wedding because the wedding is child free."]}
