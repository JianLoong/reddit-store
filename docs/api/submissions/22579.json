So this happens to be the one special day of the middle child. Well, that clearly went against the grain of the deeply embedded psychological addiction of the family's mother, who thrived on the neediness of the youngest daughter. The mother spent the entire wedding process, from beginning of planning to arrival at events to even middle-of-the-ceremony vows, making the whole thing about the youngest daughter + grandchild.

She can just dance and eat and not have a drink there. But I agree with you.", "Many parents don\u2019t want to give children bottles nowadays I hear. Like at all. \n\nSome kids also never latch on to bottles. Seen once baby fed with a syringe without a needle; similar to how you feed baby animals when they are separated from their parent \ud83e\udee3", "\"You're tearing our family apart, LISA!!!\"", "Depends on who\u2019s in your tribe. Some of us have friends and/or family whose children are the spawns of Satan. You know the kind; they\u2019ll be running races up and down the aisles, squirting the officiant with a water pistol filled with red cordial, and tipping over the table holding the wedding cake while wrestling. And their parents will sit back, saying \u201cwe\u2019re raising Brittannee to be a free spirit\u201d.\n\nThankfully you have time to work this out with BIL. The kid won\u2019t be a newborn by then, and you may even be able to organise a kids room and babysitting onsite, depending on the venue. \n\nJust talk directly to BIL - MIL is itching to stir up drama, so leave her out of the discussion altogether.", "I think she\u2019s not being totally truthful about them being in \u201cagreement.\u201d His best man is having a kid\u2026this smells like a capitulation rather than an agreement.", "Give the new parents a chance to go, her a full day with the baby. Sounds like a win-win.", "And his wife!!", "That's another subreddit board all together, if I'm not mistaken.", "Let's be fair, this could be simple entitlement as easily as it could be anything else.\n\nSince I'm not a mental health professional and we're going off a second-hand amount of the behaviour, I feel like no one here can comment on MILs mental state other than to say that she would likely benefit from some form of therapy.", "Not every personality trait is a symptom of some kind of mental illness or disorder. Some people are just assholes.\n\nAnd there is something to be said for TOO much lableing. You don't NEED to attach a lable to every single thing person does or feels that is outside the norm. At a certain point it's like you're confining people to a very small box.", "Completely agree! Was just commenting that at the 8-9 month mark there isn\u2019t really the excuse any longer that you absolutely can\u2019t leave them with someone else for a few hours since any dual set of working parent does on a daily basis. True, many parents choose not to have others watch their kids until they are older but there is a big difference between a newborn and a baby who is likely at the crawling stage. Edit to add - I am a total introvert so I could totally see telling my husband to go have fun while I stay back with the kids. No one should be forced to go to a wedding.", "Ha, I wish someone would have told my oldest he should have been eating food at that age. He flat out refused until he was like 14 months old. And wouldn\u2019t take a bottle, so definitely no leaving for long. \n\nAnd I wish someone would have told my youngest that other people aren\u2019t the devil incarnate and that a babysitter would be totally fine. We weren\u2019t able to leave that kid with anyone till they were like 6 (although they still hate most people, so they haven\u2019t really outgrown it).", "Sure, there are exceptions. (I should know\u2026I\u2019ve nursed, syringe fed and bottle fed my babies, one of whom had latch issues). But by 8-9 months nearly all babies do take bottles (if that weren\u2019t the case, mom would literally have to be with baby 24/7\u2026no running errands, no going back to work, no babysitters, no day care\u2026).", "I don't have friends with children I don't like :)", "There isn\u2019t any evidence in the post to suggest that. And I guess you *can* just assume the OP is lying, but if you\u2019re just gonna ignore the main post and substitute your own facts then I don\u2019t really see the point anymore.", "Here here! Far too many armchair psychologists and people who automatically make wild accusations or immediately jump to therapy or ending relationships or going no contact over fairly mild issues as the only solution. The actual professionals that comment on this sub (therapists, lawyers, etc.) are always extremely careful to make it clear that they're not offering any real advice or diagnosing anyone, but lots of other people seem to just like to throw shit out there and see what sticks.", "[deleted]", "Wait didn't they have a house episode about someone who was a massive dick and was trying to see if it was a symptom or something of the sort?", "I wouldn't trust her to not show up with the baby...", "Unless it was close family, I wasn\u2019t comfortable with anyone watching my child until he was old enough to speak in a way I understood. If someone hurt him, made him scared, or touched him inappropriately I wanted him to be able to tell me in unequivocal terms. \u201cJust find some stranger to watch your infant\u201d is wild to me.", "Not always. Some kids are fine changing between a nipple and a bottle, but some are definitely not and only drink from one or the other. But that\u2019s usually a more common thing the younger they are. \n\nIt\u2019s reasonable to want a childfree wedding, it\u2019s reasonable to not be able to attend if you can\u2019t bring your kids. It\u2019s not reasonable to demand that anyone HAS to be there (baby or guest).", "True. Point still stands tho. By 9 months she should be able to take some breaks from being the sole feeder.", "You\u2019re very fortunate!\n\nAnd it may not be about not liking them per se. Some kids have ADHD, or are just high energy and require lots of wrangling. It\u2019s also very dependent on the type of venue and the format of the event.", "Nah, people do it all the time on here. So I will still read between the lines and take an educated guess that the finacee wants his brother/best man fully involved which would include BILs wife being present. MIL is still overreacting though.", "You seem nice.", "Ok, Dr. Baby. Where did you get your psychiatry degree, exactly? I'd like to check your credentials.", "Yeah the babysitter thing is legit. I have no issues with child free weddings and think OP should hold firm against pushy MIL. But child averse people do themselves no favors when they dismiss or belittle the real issues of dealing with infant child care, since they\u2019ll lose the sympathy of other guests who are more understanding.", ">\u201cJust find some stranger to watch your infant\u201d is wild to me.\n\nAbsolutely this. \n\nNot everyone CAN afford it or is willing to do so, let's say someone from the family who won't charge you... Still, people are not feeling comfortable leaving their children is totally valid.", "Thanks for the lacking insight! That makes sense. \n\nAnd yeah hard agree. It\u2019s no secret that you\u2019re gonna have to forgo big adult social functions in the beginning of a kid\u2019s life but that doesn\u2019t mean those things should cease to be. It\u2019s outrageous that someone who\u2019s not the couple could claim that the day has been ruined by their own decision. I know she has an emotional and possibly financial investment in this day but it\u2019s simply not her day.", "Yep. I am amazed at my friends who behave this way. They can't understand why children or children in laws don't want them around grandchildren. I am very respectful of boundaries - be it SM posts or spending time with grands. Both daughter and DIL feel very comfortable with me around their kids and have since they were very small.", "Sure dude. You wanna just assume OP is lying because woman, be my guest.", "\u201cMany\u201d is unlikely. If you won\u2019t let your children out of your sight for 5 years straight then you should seek medical help (not a joke, that\u2019s a paralysing level of anxiety).", "I don't think that's fair. I know my child eventually will have his own activities as I have mine, but in today's world there's only very few people I truly trust to take care of him (and mostly they live abroad)\n\nChildren are an easy target to get abducted, to be abused and such and is a perfectly valid reason to postpone your social activities to take care of your child, after all it's your job as a parent."]}
