She has been taking various pictures of him throughout his life and has almost documented every second of his existence. Up until he was 17, she would choose what clothes he wore, and made all decisions for him, and refused to let him choose by himself.\r  \n\r  \nShe told him multiple times as a teen, that she would be planning his wedding and that whoever he found would \"just have to be fine with that.\"\r  \n\r  \nWell, I'm not. For a while now, I've been wanting to plan my wedding. Like.. any normal bride would.\r  \n\r  \nMy soon to be MIL, immediatley after my fiance proposed, almost started talking to me like I was her child.\r  \n\r  \nShe told me where I'd be having my wedding, and sent me some wedding dress styles I could choose from. I immediatley told her no, and said that it was my wedding, and she didn't have any right to control aspects of it.\r  \n\r  \nShe was very angry, and told me that I was an AH for not letting her \"live out her dream.\" But, nevertheless, I continued to plan MY wedding.\r  \n\r  \nEverything went sideways when I decided I did not want photos being taken during the ceremony by anyone else but the photographer. I would like everyone attending to be mentally and emotionally present and be respectful of everyone\u2019s view.\r  \n\r  \nTo be clear, I don't mean no photos for the whole wedding, I just mean for the ceremony and the first dance. Guests will have permission to take pictures after that, but I want them to keep their cameras down, and enjoy the ceremony.\r  \n\r  \nI texted her and explained this to her. She was absolutely furious and said that I was insane and that she would not be following my wishes. She's gone no contact for the past few days, despite me trying multiple times to explain. I have a feeling she's never going to let me have the day how I want it.\r  \n\r  \nAt this point I'm considering telling her that if she can't accept my wedding for how it is, then she doesn't need to attend. I know that she will want to take a bunch of group photos, that I don't know we have time for, and may cause unnecessary chaos regardless.\r  \n\r  \nAm I an AH? Should I have just let her take pictures? I feel like I'm ruining things with her, but she won't let me plan my wedding the way I want it.", "created_utc": 1697673684, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17b5c54/aita_for_wanting_to_plan_my_wedding/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
