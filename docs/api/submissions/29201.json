It was positioned so it'd be in the background of every one of our official pictures. I had to yell at him to take it down and put it away.

Of course we got charged for all the 'extra' photos.", "The title told me all I needed to know but I read everything anyway and my answer didn't change-- NTA! \n\nIt is YOUR wedding, not hers. If she can't respect your wishes, you are completely in the right to tell her not to attend. \nClassic grandiose narcissistic wench is what she is.\n\nEdit: And I think you should hold your fiance's feet to the fire on this.

I definitely let some things turn into power struggles with my MIL and maybe some things I should have let go for the sake of the relationship, but I couldn't and didn't.

I don't think there's anything wrong with asking people not to take photos, and I don't really see why anyone would have an issue with the request.", "NTA why isn\u2019t your fianc\u00e9 stamping this behaviour out?

A lot of couples work out what family photos they want in advance, and let the required people know to stick around after the ceremony. There's usually someone who wants \"family portrait of just my side! All 87 cousins, and no new spouses pls!\". Let them organise that stuff themselves during the break between the ceremony and the reception. (Just don't let them steal people from the wedding photos you've planned and paid for!)\n\nIf you have a photographer during the reception, they usually go around to each table to take a group photo.

Hire an off duty cop for security and I\u2019d she shows up he\u2019s to call the cops and not let her in.", "NTA Apart from the good advice already given by others, if you are going to have the wedding that you planned, you and your fiance are going to need a wrangler for his mother. \nEven if she gives up making plans for you beforehand, I would absolutely not trust her on the day, and neither of you need to be bothered by having to deal with her interference.  \nYou want your fiance to be focused on your wedding day, not his mother's antics. Get someone good, not afraid to put their foot down or bodily remove her if necessary.  Pay them if you have to! \nIf she was still dressing him till he was 17 she's a force to be reckoned with. Good luck.", "NTA- If you marry into this family without your fianc\u00e9 backing you up and standing up to his mother, she is going to steamroll you at every turn until the day she goes into the grave.

If your fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t standing up to her now, it\u2019s going to take a miracle for him to *ever* stand up to her. My MIL was controlling as hell, but I wasn\u2019t a pushover and she and I locked horns from the beginning. My husband chose me over the matriarch and all hell broke loose from that point until the day she passed. Unfortunately, one of her other children picked up the feud where she left off and there\u2019s still an estrangement there after nearly three decades.

Where is your partner in all of this?", "cut contact. she will control when and were and how you fuck her son and on what schedule.

Seriously, he should have your back here. If he doesn't, consider how your marriage/rest of your life would be.\n\nNow a few tips that may help the both of you (you and MIL).\nThe photographer will take group pictures. Why not let your mom \"tag along\" and take pictures at the same time (except for the ones she needs to be in)? Then you're sure she won't take up extra time for pictures and she has the benefit of having the photographer as an example for angles, composition, and so on. On my wedding, a very good friend did that and her pictures turned out better than the photographers. But she let the photographer set the pace. We never had to wait for her.\n\nMaybe there's other small things you can include her in. Eg. If you've already made a selection of something and can't decide between the last two, include her. You already know both are to your liking and you can use this to bond a bit with her. Unless ofcourse she'll shoot down both of your options. But maybe she'll just be so happy that you're including her, that she'll actually be nice.\n\nMaybe that's even one single element that you can let her arrange. I know you also want to do it all yourself (it's part of the fun, I think) but maybe they're is something you can let go just for the sake of your relationship?\n\nGood luck!", "Esh because you sound exactly like her because you have planned and you say what you want but how about your fianc\u00e9? He gets to plan too but from what you say he doesn\u2019t seem to be allowed to have input.", "NTA but why isn't your fiance taking point with his own mother? It is his job to communicate to her that you both have the wedding planning handled and all she needs to do is show up. If this were reversed, it would be your job to take point with any conflicts with your own family and his job to support and back you up.\n\nIf he just rolls over for momma and expects you to sacrifice your own happiness for her pleasure, you are in for either a short marriage or a painfully long life.", "ESH. Your MIL needs help, no rational human being behaves like this towards their adult son, your boyfriend needs to stand up to his mother and your no photo rule is utterly ridiculous.

Your future MIL should be more receptive to his opinions.", "NTA for not wanting your MIL to plan the wedding. \n\nBut the way you talk about \u201cMY wedding\u201d concerns me.

If so you might find that they don\u2019t allow photos to be taken during the ceremony other than walking down and up the aisle and no throwing of confetti in the church and biodegradable only in the church grounds - you have no control over that.  Why can\u2019t she just wait till the official photos?  Picking your dress and location is just - weird. If she wants her dream wedding then why doesn\u2019t renew her vows with her own husband and leave you to have the wedding that you want?

Stand your ground now, otherwise youll be making compromises throughout your marriage to her son.", "Oh she would hate me. All she would hear is NO. I would tell her she should have had a daughter if planning a wedding was so important. \n\nWith someone like her it might be good to play dumb, forget to return calls, pretend to agree and then do what you want. Avoid confrontation unless necessary. She sounds hard core and is not likely to change. Involve your fianc\u00e9 because he is really the one to set limits.  If she gets herself uninvited he needs to be in agreement with you.", "NTA, and there is a high risk that your MIL will pull a stunt to ruin your Wedding.

Move as soon as you can and as far as you can\n\nEdited:typo", "NTA\nPut your foot down on MIL, it will show her you will not take her BS & she can\u2019t mess with you. I hope your future husband is on your side. if he is hiding in the corner, while you & MIL are butting heads, this will show he lost his balls to his mum and you will spend the rest of your life having him running away, when there is problems. \n\nA friend of mine had similar problems as you. Her MIL wanted to have the wedding of her dream, not what friend & groom wanted. Groom ran away, whenever friend & MIL argued. When friend told groom \u201cI don\u2019t want my future to have you running away from problems. So I don\u2019t think I want a future with you anymore\u201d. (She said this to him in front of me & other bridesmaids, after a nightmare dress shopping with his mum.) he asked her what he can do to have a future with her, she told him to get his balls back from his mummy. As us bridesmaids were about to leave, MIL showed up. She wanted to tell groom to leave friend. He finally told his mum off, he did actually say \u201cI\u2019m taking my balls back mum!\u201d Her told her after the way she treated him & friend, she is no longer in their life. His dad backed him up (I think they split now).

If he can't stand up to her and set some boundaries - and then enforce them - this is what the rest of your life will look like. She will choose your home and decorate it for you. She will be your shadow during any pregnancies, will decorate your nursery and probably one in her house as well, throw your baby shower and set up the gift registry for you. She will choose your child's name, refer to your child as her baby, tag along on all your holidays... You get the idea.\n\nHe needs to sort it out.
