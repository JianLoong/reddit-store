I had a lot of well-intentioned friends trying to snap pictures at my wedding that just got in the way of my professional photographer and ruined a lot of pictures.

It was positioned so it'd be in the background of every one of our official pictures. I had to yell at him to take it down and put it away.

Of course we got charged for all the 'extra' photos.", "The title told me all I needed to know but I read everything anyway and my answer didn't change-- NTA! \n\nIt is YOUR wedding, not hers. If she can't respect your wishes, you are completely in the right to tell her not to attend. \nClassic grandiose narcissistic wench is what she is.\n\nEdit: And I think you should hold your fiance's feet to the fire on this.

So before you set the world on fire and uninvite your fiance's mother, find out what is really important to you BOTH, and then go from there, picking your battles and the least dramaticways to win them.

We never had to wait for her.\n\nMaybe there's other small things you can include her in. Eg. If you've already made a selection of something and can't decide between the last two, include her. You already know both are to your liking and you can use this to bond a bit with her. Unless ofcourse she'll shoot down both of your options. But maybe she'll just be so happy that you're including her, that she'll actually be nice.\n\nMaybe that's even one single element that you can let her arrange.

It is his job to communicate to her that you both have the wedding planning handled and all she needs to do is show up.

I come from a country where it's common to live with in-laws (the guy's parents) after marriage, and honestly, it seems like this situation will never change for me. We had a grand wedding with two main functions. For the ring ceremony, the attire was chosen by the in-laws for both the bride and groom, which seemed reasonable. However, for the wedding dress, you're supposed to buy it yourself. It was frustrating that my parents were paying for my wedding outfit, yet my sister-in-law and mother-in-law accompanied my mom and me to select it. I really wanted a specific outfit that my mother-in-law didn't approve of. Your wedding outfit is something a girl dreams about her whole life, after all. My mother wasn't even invited to help choose my husband's outfit for the wedding, which I understood since it's his attire. The jewelry, which was quite expensive and also paid for by my parents, was selected by my in-laws. They went to a store they knew, finalized it, and then called my mom, saying they had negotiated it, and we could buy it. It's almost comical. The jewelry and engagement ring they bought for me weren't shown to me until the day of the event. I did go with my husband to pick out his ring, though. \n\nNow, regarding the venue, we had initially agreed on one, but it was changed a month before the wedding because they feared the Omicron variant might disrupt the function. However, they decided on a new venue, invited 600 guests, all paid for by my parents. We kept agreeing because I wanted to marry him, and that meant the world to my parents. Unfortunately, my parents incurred a non-refundable loss due to the change in venue; it was initially supposed to be at a W resort. \n\nI deal with similar situations every day, and it's making me bitter. I have to seek permission from my mother-in-law before leaving the house or meeting my parents. She decides what we eat, what clothes look good on me, and constantly comments on everything. My husband is a good son, and we argue about this often. \n\nI wish I could tell you not to be like me, and I hope to tell my future daughter the same. I only want to remain a good person and avoid becoming bitter in the midst of all this.", "NTA\n\nIf your BF doesn\u2019t back you up now, though, you need to cancel the wedding.\n\nMarriages are between 2 people, not 3.

I come from a country where it's common to live with in-laws (the guy's parents) after marriage, and honestly, it seems like this situation will never change for me. We had a grand wedding with two main functions. For the ring ceremony, the attire was chosen by the in-laws for both the bride and groom, which seemed reasonable. However, for the wedding dress, you're supposed to buy it yourself. It was frustrating that my parents were paying for my wedding outfit, yet my sister-in-law and mother-in-law accompanied my mom and me to select it. I really wanted a specific outfit that my mother-in-law didn't approve of. Your wedding outfit is something a girl dreams about her whole life, after all. My mother wasn't invited to help choose my husband's outfit for the wedding, which I understood since it's his attire. The jewelry, which was quite expensive and also paid for by my parents, was selected by my in-laws. They went to a store they knew, finalized it, and then called my mom, saying they had negotiated it, and we could buy it. It's almost comical. The jewelry and engagement ring they bought for me weren't shown to me until the day of the event. My husband did go with me to pick out his ring, though. \n\nNow, regarding the venue, we had initially agreed on one, but it was changed a month before the wedding because they feared the Omicron variant might disrupt the function. However, they decided on a new venue, invited 600 guests, all paid for by my parents. We kept agreeing because I wanted to marry him, and that meant the world to my parents. Unfortunately, my parents incurred a non-refundable loss due to the change in venue; it was initially supposed to be at a W resort. \n\nI deal with similar situations every day, and it's making me bitter. I have to seek permission from my mother-in-law before leaving the house or meeting my parents. She decides what we eat, what clothes look good on me, and constantly comments on everything jokingly. My husband is a good son, and we argue about this often. \n\nI wish I could tell her not to be like me, and I hope to tell my future daughter the same. I only want to remain a good person and avoid becoming bitter in the midst of all this.", "correctest answer on here", "OP, from this point forward put this woman on an info diet.

In 1960, 80% of bottle fed babies consumed formula based on evaporated milk, with added corn syrup. \n\nYou should recall that the medical community have made wild errors in the past, such as when smoking was deemed good for the health, and asbestos made houses safer. \n\nThe medical community deemed breastfeeding to be unsanitary, and drudgery that tied the mother to breastfeeding. This was also the era in which psychiatrists claimed that too much attention given to children ruined them. Mothers were told to stop holding or hugging their kids, and to leave them to cry alone. They were supposed to independently solve their problems, even as newborns. Crying was never to be met with affection or holding, even when the children were quite young. \n\nThe medical community also claimed that the Twilight Sleep was the most humane way for a woman to give birth. She thought she was getting put to sleep, and would wake up with a baby, no memory of what happened, and a sore throat. What actually occurred, however, was that the Twilight Sleep was an amnesiac, and would cause delirium and hallucinations. Women were strapped down, and they would scream and scream and scream, like animals. Husbands were never permitted anywhere near the delivery room, so they couldn't hear. Doctors felt that since the drug was an amnesiac, the experience wouldn't affect the women at all. But it did. Many women failed to bond with their babies. \n\nMy mother was the first woman to deliver natural childbirth, at the military base. She somehow managed to tour the childbirth facility, saw what was really going on, and had some kind of panic attack. She adamantly refused to have a baby there, under those conditions. She declared she would have a baby naturally, and that my father would be there. He negotiated prior approval for him to remain with my mother. This had never happened at that base before, so delivery nurses and doctors observed the birth. They said it was beautiful, and they had no idea childbirth could be like that. There was no screaming, no fighting, and no hallucinations."]}
