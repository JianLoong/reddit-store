She said that she wasn't doing traditional bridesmaid but did want to get her girls some things.\n\nFast forward to a couple weeks ago I see on instagram her maid of honor and one of our mutual friends posted their bridesmaids boxes from her, so I naturally was thinking maybe she was doing bridesmaids again and waiting till she saw me to give me hers.\n\nWell she facetimed me that same week and told me that she was originally going to do the whole bridesmaids thing like I did but that she just felt overwhelmed by it and really didn't like the ideal of traditional bridesmaids/the label and just made the 3 ppl who would be planning her bachelorette/bridal shower her \"bridesmaids\" and that she wasn't doing all the traditional stuff. And she apologized for being so back and forth about it and if she ever gave me the wrong idea but that she just envisioned something smaller for her wedding and didn't need much help from all her friends but that I would still be part of everything like the bach party, etc.\n\nI was super hurt by this because she was a bridesmaid in my wedding and I always thought I would be a part of hers. I told her this and then later RSVPed no to her wedding that's in a few months and she texted me asking about it but I've been ignoring her and plan to ice her out of my life.

And given your behaviour it\u2019s clear she made the right choice.\n\nETA I\u2019ve known one of my bridesmaids for almost 20 years. She\u2019s my best friend in the world. I love her to death and wouldn\u2019t have been able to survive motherhood without her. But when she got married and told me she was only having her sister as bridesmaid, you know what I said? I said \u201chow lovely and intimate. Let me know if your sis needs any help with the hen party.\u201d", "YTA.\n\nAre you sure you\u2019re old enough to be married?", "YTA - 2 years, and you expect her to make you a bridesmaid. This isn't quid pro quo and if you made your own bridesmaid decision with this intent, you are being incredibly manipulative. \n\nPeople are allowed different standards and desires. Do not be so petty as to justify losing a friend over their choices in a big life event. IT IS HER CHOICE and you are trying to punish her for deciding on something that makes her more comfortable because you don't agree with it. This wedding isn't about you, so stop trying to make it such. If she's so important as to have been your bridesmaid because you feel incredibly close to her, is she worth losing just because she doesn't do something you were stupid enough to expect? Not everyone follows tradition - it's 2023, we're allowed to buck tradition.", "YTA, but not really an extreme one, and it\u2019s not too late to change that.\n\nMy wife was recently a similar situation, where her best friend of over a decade got engaged and didn\u2019t ask her to be a bridesmaid, even though they had always discussed it.  My wife was extremely hurt and didn\u2019t want to even attend the wedding, but I thought that was too extreme.  We compromised by attending the wedding but not the reception, and not getting a gift. When we got to the church it became abundantly obvious why she wasn\u2019t included. The bridesmaids were all members of her church, and my wife is firmly agnostic.  The vows and ceremony were heavily favoring the husband, she actually vowed to submit to him three different times and was excited to \u201cgive up her hopes and dreams to be his wife\u201d.  This was really off-putting and seemed out of character for the person we thought her to be.  \n\nThere\u2019s no guarantee of being in someone\u2019s wedding party just because they were in yours, it\u2019s on every bride/groom to decide.  It\u2019s understandable that you would be hurt by being less involved in her event, but it\u2019s HER event and you have to accept that to be a good friend.  Perhaps her tastes and ideas for her wedding don\u2019t align with yours, and she\u2019s trying to keep things civil by not having you in a position to fight any of her choices. Maybe there\u2019s something about the groom or groomsmen that she doesn\u2019t want to inflict upon you. There\u2019s some other reason that she didn\u2019t involve you, and it\u2019s not because she dislikes you.  If she makes your life better by being in it, then keep your friendship and let this go.", "YTA & childish.", "YTA--- You are not entitled to that roll in her wedding party....she doesn't OWE you anything just because she had a roll in your wedding. Also, you've only known her 2 years. Not to downplay your friendship, but I wouldn't die on this hill, it's not like you're childhood friends.", "YTA.

Your entitlement is showing and it is not a good look.  Your husband sounds like  a rational individual you should probably listen to his advice instead of being mad that he \"picked\" sides.  He in fact is just right, while you are wrong.", "Dude you\u2019ve only been friends for two years, that\u2019s not a long friendship. She probably has more long term friends she wanted to include.

I asked her to be one of my bridesmaids when the time came for me to get married, and I was happy to have her be part of it. \n\nYour friend is better off without you, now she can start her married life with her actual friends.", "YTA\n\nYour behavior seems awful petty.

I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re married, because this whole thing reminds me of high school level drama. She\u2019s perfectly justified in wanting a smaller bridal party. Just because you made her a bridesmaid doesn\u2019t mean she is required to make you one. The fact that you\u2019re willing to ice her out and throw the whole friendship away says a lot about your maturity level.", "YTA. This is her wedding. It is her decision. Traditional bridesmaids are not mandatory. She doesn\u2019t owe you a thing.

Get over it.  IT's not about you.", "YTA. *\"I plan to ice her out of my life\"* really??? You are ending a friendship because you weren't a bridesmaid. How childish! It's HER wedding, she gets to decide who is a   \n bridesmaid. She said she just wanted a small bridal party. A true friend would have supported this and enjoyed the wedding and celebrated with her, but instead you threw a hissy fit. She even tried to include you in the bachelorette party. It's probably for the best that you aren't a bridesmaid since you seem to like throwing fits when things don't go your way. You are even dragging your husband into this. Grow up OP!", "YTA - you are very immature.", "YTA.  She should be stoked that you RSVP\u2019d no.", "YTA. What are you, 12 years old? Time to knock off all that middle school drama crap. She has a different vision for her wedding than you do. You need to be understanding of how she wants her wedding to be and be happy she still wants you involved.

Your friend is better off without your petty friendship.\n\nI had something similar happen to me. I had first planned on a large bridal party but ended up scaling it back to four bridesmaids and four groomsmen.

One of my other good friends (little did I know at the time she was an ah like op)I still wanted to be involved in the big day somehow because I cared about her and didn\u2019t want her to be just a \u201cguest\u201d so I asked her to help at the reception by getting people to sign well wishes on ornaments (it was a winter wedding)she would have gotten a nice large corsage and in the programs her name would have been in the special thank you section plus photos of us together plus and a nice necklace as a thank you gift) not only did she not come to my wedding she completely ghosted me before the wedding. Over a 10 year friendship ended because she was jealous and mad over not being in the wedding party.", "YTA.  It\u2019s her wedding and your job is to be there on the big day and support her.

I'm sure you have people in your life that you don't care much about that think the opposite as well.  You're entitled to being hurt by this realization.  \n\n\nBut she went about it the correct way and called you, explained, and said sorry.

I plan on having 1 bridesmaid and it will be her.", "She is probably not as much a high maintenance friend as you are", "Here we go again. A true AH that comes here, asks for judgement, and then argues worn everyone. YTA. No one owes you anything with regards to THEIR wedding. You sound like an petulant child.", "1. How old are you? Two years of friendship really isn't that long, and it doesn't matter that she's known one of her bridesmaids for less time than she's known you - because bridesmaids aren't picked by length of friendship. \n\n2. What makes you think you deserve to be a bridesmaid? Just because you had her stand up with you doesn't mean she's obligated to have you stand up with her. Her agreeing to be your bridesmaid wasn't an IOU. \n\n3. She's not excluding you because she's still trying to include you in all of the traditional bridesmaid activities. She just doesn't want a lot of people up at the altar, and *that's okay*. \n\n4. If you're willing to throw away this relationship with your \"best friend\" because she didn't ask you to be a bridesmaid, then you're obviously not a very good friend to begin with. I didn't ask one of my best friends to be a bridesmaid at my second wedding (widowed, not divorced) because I didn't want too many people up there with me, even though she was a bridesmaid at my first wedding. Do you know what she did? She came as a guest and had a great time and is still one of my very best friends. \n\n5. Grow tf up.\n\n(Edit: spelling)", "And she probably likes her more/is closer to her than you. Doesn\u2019t mean y\u2019all aren\u2019t still friends.", "It's almost like some people can form a strong bond in a shorter length of time! Crazy!!!", "Maybe she\u2019s more mature than you are", "1. 29", "You are WAY too old to be acting like this. Again - grow up.", "YTA. I had a good friend that I hoped might make me a bridesmaid because most of the folks I'm close to aren't going to get married. I knew it wasn't super realistic because we'd only been friends 3 years when she got engaged. She had the grace to tell me in person that I wasn't going to be a bridesmaid, and honestly I was sad, but I knew she had plenty of long-standing friendships. \n\nYou get to be disappointed. Feelings are feelings. You shouldn\u2019t cut her out though, she doesn't owe you.", "YTA and you\u2019re petty as hell.", "YTA. You asked her to be in your bridal party because that\u2019s what you wanted. It\u2019s not conditional that you\u2019re made one in return. Then you up the petty anti and refuse to attend the wedding at all.", "YTA.\n\nAbout 90% of YTA judgments here could be avoided if people just realised:\n\n**It's not all about you.**\n\nIf you forget the idea that you're the main character in other people's lives and everything that they do isn't somehow about you, you'll be much happier.", "YTA - honestly being a bridesmaid is super expensive and annoying. Going as a guest is so much better. You can wear your own outfit and do hair and makeup how you want. \n\nI\u2019ve offered to help my friends with wedding stuff because I want to and they are my friends. I don\u2019t do it hoping to get picked as a bridesmaid.", "YTA - so you think if you have someone in your wedding that automatically means you're going to be in theirs? I mean she stated she was not doing a traditional bridal party. My sister didn't have any Bridesmaids, and I didn't care. Her reasoning behind it was she didn't want any of her friends to feel left out or her sister not that I would have but anyway, she just didn't have them. She did have a special flower corsage thing for me but just because someone was in your wedding does not mean they have to have you in theirs", "YTA she\u2019s had people in her life longer than 2 years and it\u2019s okay they take precedence", "YTA\nMy friend didn't ask me to be a bridesmaid in her wedding, she had three bridesmaids. I was a little disappointed as we'd been good friends for ten years but I never said anything to her and still helped with the wedding planning. Guess what, I got over it and still asked her to be a bridesmaid in mine a couple years later. I can't even imagine cutting her out of my life for something so stupid. You obviously weren't friends if this matters more than your friendship.", "YTA friendzilla", "YTA. Are you 13 years old? Just because she was your bridesmaid doesn't mean you're automatically one hers.", "Yta", "I mean, I dunno how to decide that. My best friend said I was her MoH for her wedding then months later said I wasn\u2019t in her wedding at all because she didn\u2019t think I could afford it, even though I could. I didn\u2019t go to her wedding after that and I stopped talking to her. \n\nI\u2019d say NTA just because it\u2019s the same thing I did, but different circumstances", "Yep YTA being petty and entitled for your so-called- friends day cause your not bridesmaid...", "YTA. It\u2019s not quid pro quo", "YTA-she was honest with you and apologized and you still were offended. Grow up!", "YTA and a bad friend tbh", "Yta. A ridiculous one, at that.", "Yta\n\nThe wedding is about her and her fianc\u00e9. Not about you.\n\nWtf this friendship is not her loss because you are not a good friend. You are not entitled to be a bridesmaid because she was one in yours.", "Yta", "YTA. You don't have many long term friends do you?", "YTA\n\nSorry but it's immature to make it about you. Yes it might be hurtful but your reaction is kind of indicative that perception by others matters more than just giving your friend whatever support in whatever form she needs.", "YTA. one of my closest friends got married last fall. we lived together for two years and have been friends for over ten years. she didn\u2019t ask me to be a bridesmaid. i was slightly hurt but her wedding wasn\u2019t about me. and you bet i was in attendance on one of the most important days of her lives and i made sure she knows how much i love her and value her friendship. because that\u2019s what friendship is. you don\u2019t keep score or try to make your feelings more important than hers. you don\u2019t sound like a very good friend and tbh she\u2019s probably better off without you.", "YTA *WHINE WHINE WHINE* \"My friend won't do something exactly how I did something and now I will punish her by blowing her off !\"", "Wow I didn\u2019t know middle schoolers could get married now\nYTA", "Yta this is really petty", "YTA. Just because she was in your wedding doesn\u2019t mean she has to make you a bridesmaid. This is so childish.", "YTA - even if she was having \u201ctraditional\u201d bridesmaids, you nor anyone else is entitled or owed to be one. She can pick who she wants and she made a good decision by not picking you if this is how you\u2019re going to act", "YTA. Stop making her wedding about you.", "YTA for assuming her wedding would mirror yours. Bridesmaid duties do not come with a reciprocity agreement so you shouldn\u2019t have assumed that you would automatically be involved in her bridal party. Maybe she should have had a conversation with you about it but you should in no way have assumed you\u2019d have that role.", "YTA\u2014you having her as your bridesmaid does not entitle you to any part of her wedding. Not everyone has the same wants, needs, or values when it comes to weddings. The fact you took it personally says a lot about you. My sister was my maid of honour, and I wasn\u2019t even in her wedding party. She asked me to officiate instead. I was also a very new mom for her bachelorette party, which was a wine tour in another town, and I wasn\u2019t offended at all that she chose something like that for her bachelorette. Don\u2019t make sh** about you that ain\u2019t about you. \n\nIn order to avoid weird friend drama like this, my husband and I only had our siblings stand up for us. How exhausting you must be as a friend.", "YTA\n\nYou are for real about to drop a friend because you weren't a bridesmaid?\n\nYour husband is right", "YTA, you seem very entitled. As soon as I finished reading this, I immediately thought \"wow you're entitled.\"", "YTA\nShe has a whole circle of friends outside of you. It's also really weird that you had her as a brides maid to begin with since you only knew her for a little over a year at that point. Thats something for long time close friends and family. She still wants you included, but she has a life outside of you, and those people who are part of that, are her brides maids. It also sounds like your the clingy friend and that isn't great either. Your husband is right YTA. You are not the center of the universe.", "Yta. Just because you did something some kind of way doesn't obligate anyone to reciprocate in the same fashion. \n\nNor should you ever ever assume that you'll be asked to be a bridesmaid.  Ever. Which is honestly, imo, double ah territory.", "YTA and this is one of the shallowest reasons to end a friendship, the fact you plan to ice her out to end it is immature also. \n\nShe does not owe you for making her a bridesmaid in your wedding.", "YTA friends don\u2019t come easy as you age and icing the ones you have out  over pettiness like that  is incredibly sad. You can be hurt. I get it it. But she has her personal reasons why she just wanted three. It doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not your friend. What does that say about you as a person?  She didn\u2019t do anything to you that deserves freezing out.", "I had a friend who got engaged. She knew someone back in high school who got married at 18, and she was in their bridal party. 12 years later, this same person assumed she would be in my friend's bridal party because that's just how it works. She literally broke down in tears in public and started yelling-sobbing when my friend apologetically told her she wanted a small wedding with no bridal party and only her siblings standing up with her.", "Well maybe she just likes the three people she chose more than you. It doesn't mean she dislikes you.", "I had 2 bridesmaids who I've been besties with since I was 8 and 15. I had other friends, some of who I'd known for only a few years, at my bachelorette party but imo being a BM is a big lift for a newish friend.", "Damn, if this is how you're acting at your age, I think it's pretty obvious why she didn't make you a bridesmaid.", "Nah I asked my best friends. You can have them on your own side if you want them in the wedding"]}
