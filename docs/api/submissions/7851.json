I got married last august and she was a bridesmaid in my wedding so naturally when she got engaged around the same time I was excited to be a bridesmaid in her wedding as well.\n\nShe reached out to me two months ago asking me to pick a color for something, I assumed it was bridesmaid stuff and asked her straight up. She said that she wasn't doing traditional bridesmaid but did want to get her girls some things.\n\nFast forward to a couple weeks ago I see on instagram her maid of honor and one of our mutual friends posted their bridesmaids boxes from her, so I naturally was thinking maybe she was doing bridesmaids again and waiting till she saw me to give me hers.\n\nWell she facetimed me that same week and told me that she was originally going to do the whole bridesmaids thing like I did but that she just felt overwhelmed by it and really didn't like the ideal of traditional bridesmaids/the label and just made the 3 ppl who would be planning her bachelorette/bridal shower her \"bridesmaids\" and that she wasn't doing all the traditional stuff. And she apologized for being so back and forth about it and if she ever gave me the wrong idea but that she just envisioned something smaller for her wedding and didn't need much help from all her friends but that I would still be part of everything like the bach party, etc.\n\nI was super hurt by this because she was a bridesmaid in my wedding and I always thought I would be a part of hers. I told her this and then later RSVPed no to her wedding that's in a few months and she texted me asking about it but I've been ignoring her and plan to ice her out of my life.

And given your behaviour it\u2019s clear she made the right choice.\n\nETA I\u2019ve known one of my bridesmaids for almost 20 years. She\u2019s my best friend in the world. I love her to death and wouldn\u2019t have been able to survive motherhood without her. But when she got married and told me she was only having her sister as bridesmaid, you know what I said? I said \u201chow lovely and intimate. Let me know if your sis needs any help with the hen party.\u201d", "YTA.\n\nAre you sure you\u2019re old enough to be married?", "YTA - 2 years, and you expect her to make you a bridesmaid. This isn't quid pro quo and if you made your own bridesmaid decision with this intent, you are being incredibly manipulative. \n\nPeople are allowed different standards and desires. Do not be so petty as to justify losing a friend over their choices in a big life event. IT IS HER CHOICE and you are trying to punish her for deciding on something that makes her more comfortable because you don't agree with it. This wedding isn't about you, so stop trying to make it such. If she's so important as to have been your bridesmaid because you feel incredibly close to her, is she worth losing just because she doesn't do something you were stupid enough to expect? Not everyone follows tradition - it's 2023, we're allowed to buck tradition.", "YTA, but not really an extreme one, and it\u2019s not too late to change that.\n\nMy wife was recently a similar situation, where her best friend of over a decade got engaged and didn\u2019t ask her to be a bridesmaid, even though they had always discussed it.  My wife was extremely hurt and didn\u2019t want to even attend the wedding, but I thought that was too extreme.  We compromised by attending the wedding but not the reception, and not getting a gift. When we got to the church it became abundantly obvious why she wasn\u2019t included. The bridesmaids were all members of her church, and my wife is firmly agnostic.  The vows and ceremony were heavily favoring the husband, she actually vowed to submit to him three different times and was excited to \u201cgive up her hopes and dreams to be his wife\u201d.  This was really off-putting and seemed out of character for the person we thought her to be.  \n\nThere\u2019s no guarantee of being in someone\u2019s wedding party just because they were in yours, it\u2019s on every bride/groom to decide.  It\u2019s understandable that you would be hurt by being less involved in her event, but it\u2019s HER event and you have to accept that to be a good friend.  Perhaps her tastes and ideas for her wedding don\u2019t align with yours, and she\u2019s trying to keep things civil by not having you in a position to fight any of her choices. Maybe there\u2019s something about the groom or groomsmen that she doesn\u2019t want to inflict upon you. There\u2019s some other reason that she didn\u2019t involve you, and it\u2019s not because she dislikes you.  If she makes your life better by being in it, then keep your friendship and let this go.", "YTA & childish.", "YTA--- You are not entitled to that roll in her wedding party....she doesn't OWE you anything just because she had a roll in your wedding. Also, you've only known her 2 years. Not to downplay your friendship, but I wouldn't die on this hill, it's not like you're childhood friends.", "YTA.

Your entitlement is showing and it is not a good look.  Your husband sounds like  a rational individual you should probably listen to his advice instead of being mad that he \"picked\" sides.  He in fact is just right, while you are wrong.", "Dude you\u2019ve only been friends for two years, that\u2019s not a long friendship. She probably has more long term friends she wanted to include.

I asked her to be one of my bridesmaids when the time came for me to get married, and I was happy to have her be part of it. \n\nYour friend is better off without you, now she can start her married life with her actual friends.", "YTA\n\nYour behavior seems awful petty. You do realize making someone your bridesmaid doesn't entitle you to be theirs, right?\n\nIt's ok if you \"ice her out of your life\" though. No big loss for her.", "YTA but it\u2019s honestly fine. She doesn\u2019t need a friend like you. Ice her out and let her enjoy her happy wedding & marriage. You can be bitter, it\u2019s fine.", "YTA", "YTA. I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re married, because this whole thing reminds me of high school level drama. She\u2019s perfectly justified in wanting a smaller bridal party. Just because you made her a bridesmaid doesn\u2019t mean she is required to make you one. The fact that you\u2019re willing to ice her out and throw the whole friendship away says a lot about your maturity level.", "YTA. This is her wedding. It is her decision. Traditional bridesmaids are not mandatory. She doesn\u2019t owe you a thing. It makes me question your motives for having her in your wedding and if it was actually out of friendship because you clearly expected something in return.", "YTA.\n\nYou must be young.", " YTA she\u2019s your friend she told you she wasn\u2019t doing traditional stuff and why you were so in your feelings and made it about you when it wasn\u2019t like that. Now you want to ice her out of your life over not being bridesmaid? When she said she didn\u2019t even want bridesmaids in the first place?", "Grow up.  You're one of those people for whom everything about a friendship is an equal-basis transaction. You're not a friend at all.  YTA", "YTA", "YTA. It\u2019s extremely selfish to just EXPECT to be a bridesmaid. You\u2019re not entitled to that from anyone. And it seems that was your only intention out of the friendship as you plan to \u201cice her out,\u201d which is extremely immature.", "YTA - this is pathetic.  So she wants a smaller wedding?  Get over it.  IT's not about you.", "YTA. *\"I plan to ice her out of my life\"* really??? You are ending a friendship because you weren't a bridesmaid. How childish! It's HER wedding, she gets to decide who is a   \n bridesmaid. She said she just wanted a small bridal party. A true friend would have supported this and enjoyed the wedding and celebrated with her, but instead you threw a hissy fit. She even tried to include you in the bachelorette party. It's probably for the best that you aren't a bridesmaid since you seem to like throwing fits when things don't go your way. You are even dragging your husband into this. Grow up OP!", "YTA - you are very immature.", "YTA.  She should be stoked that you RSVP\u2019d no.", "YTA. What are you, 12 years old? Time to knock off all that middle school drama crap. She has a different vision for her wedding than you do. You need to be understanding of how she wants her wedding to be and be happy she still wants you involved. Instead you are acting like a child, pouting and giving her the silent treatment.", "YTA - what an extreme reaction over nothing.", "YTA. Grow TF up. She doesn't owe you anything just because you made her a bridesmaid. Your husband is right she did nothing wrong and your behavior is embarrassing.", "YTA and I very much doubt you will be missed for long if you don't get your act together.", "YTA and a terrible friend.", "NTA, you haven't done anything wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nYou feel hurt someone you thought was closer to you didn't reciprocate that feeling. Nothing wrong with that.\n\nYou decided not to attend their event and RSVP'd well ahead of time. Again nothing wrong.", "YTA and an idiot. Have you considered the money and time and stress you\u2019ll save\u2026 the fun you\u2019ll have at the wedding and related events just being a guest with zero obligations?\n\nWake up and see this for what it is: a gift!! A dream scenario. \n\nIt\u2019s evident that you see friendships as transactional and lack basic human decency and self-awareness.\n\nYour ego-driven need to be involved in something that isn\u2019t about you is childish and really, really weird. You\u2019re old enough to be married but you\u2019re throwing a temper tantrum over someone making a choice that is different from your own?! \nGrow up. Get over yourself. You\u2019re awful.", "YTA I had something similar happen to me. I had first planned on a large bridal party but ended up scaling it back to four bridesmaids and four groomsmen. I couldn\u2019t pick all my friends and had two of my cousins, my best friend and my friend from college who had gotten me and my husband together to be my bridesmaids. One of my other good friends (little did I know at the time she was an ah like op)I still wanted to be involved in the big day somehow because I cared about her and didn\u2019t want her to be just a \u201cguest\u201d so I asked her to help at the reception by getting people to sign well wishes on ornaments (it was a winter wedding)she would have gotten a nice large corsage and in the programs her name would have been in the special thank you section plus photos of us together plus and a nice necklace as a thank you gift) not only did she not come to my wedding she completely ghosted me before the wedding. Over a 10 year friendship ended because she was jealous and mad over not being in the wedding party.", "YTA.  It\u2019s her wedding and your job is to be there on the big day and support her.  She does not owe you a role in her wedding.  How bizarre. Good job making something to celebrate her about you.", "Soft YTA. \n\nWhen a rude sister-in-law made a big deal about excluding me from the wedding party, guess what I did? I went on a diet, got a killer dress, and professional hair and showed up and everyone's jaws dropped. \n\n\nIt is natural to be hurt by not being a bridesmaid, especially since she was not upfront about it. \n\nYou have to use healthy coping skills to work through your feelings about it. \n\nIt's not something to hold a grudge about or ruin a friendship over. Don't be vengeful. The wedding will be fun and you will miss out. \n\n\nShe may get divorced and next time you can be her bridesmaid, lol.", "Yeah.  I had to do that too, only because I never knew protocol. I\u2019m glad he never got mad.   It means nothing today.  So,Don\u2019t be a sour puss.", "YTA, almost a N A H except for how you went about it.    \n\n\nYou're not as important to her as she was to you.  That sucks, but it's the truth.  I'm sure you have people in your life that you don't care much about that think the opposite as well.  You're entitled to being hurt by this realization.  \n\n\nBut she went about it the correct way and called you, explained, and said sorry.  Instead you choose to be petty and RSVP no and tell her why.  Quite frankly, I think you icing her out is gonna hurt you way more than it'll hurt her", "4", "Yes- 2 years is a blip!!! There are likely 5 or 10 friends the bride is close to and who she has known a very long time. YTA", "but she's known the mutual friend for way less time", "I super hate the automatic assumption that being a bridesmaid means it's mandatory to reciprocate. Drives. Me. Nuts.", "This isn\u2019t the first time friend has gotten a look at the personality of OP. Imagine what a bridezilla she was", "To not go to the wedding and icing her out 100% makes the asshole. I can understand reevaluating the friendship. One of my bffs was my dual MoH and 1 month before she got engaged (she knew if was coming) asked me to start with her bridal shower and bachelorette planning. She ended up making her other friend MoH amd said she didn't want to have two as non traditional. But that she was 'happy' for me to continue the planning and pay for everything since her MoH is bad at both. Hilarious as I wasn't even working at the time on an unpaid medical leave. I still went to the wedding and brought a gift. Cuz felt that was the right thing to do.", "i don\u2019t think a healthy coping mechanism is intentionally trying to outdo the bride on her wedding day, because you feel entitled to be a part of a day that they want a certain way. \n\nsorry, that just sounds insufferable. \u201ceveryone\u2019s jaws dropped\u201d gives me \u201cand then everyone clapped\u201d vibes.\n\nwhat you did *was* holding a grudge and *was* vengeful. if you weren\u2019t, you would have accepted the circumstances. you wouldn\u2019t have centered your life around looking better and getting more attention than the bride.\n\nOP is YTA, hard. and you kinda were too.", "Forget anyone talking shit, you go girl. I hope you looked ten times better than the bride.", "Either wrong post or wrong comment here.", "What protocol?", "If you\u2019re so much more worthy to be a bridesmaid than this other friend is, why weren\u2019t you helping to plan the bridal shower and bachelorette party? It sounds like this person is a lot closer to your friend than you are.", "And clearly she is closer to that friend since you seem to be a petty, petulant child.", "So?   Maybe she's   closer to them?\nYTA  \nShe can choose who she wants", "That friend was actually helping her with her wedding! Where were you?", "You ghosted your friend over a being a bridesmaid. I was friends with one of my bridesmaids for 4 years when I got married and she didn't have me in her wedding party. She had other people that she chose, and that's fine. We still talk 5 years later.", "Are you 12? You shouldn\u2019t assume you\u2019re a bridesmaid, and you\u2019re a terrible friend if you don\u2019t go because of this. Makes sense that were not chosen to be a bridesmaid, I can only imagine how entitled you must be.", "Obviously she\u2019s choosing quality over quantity. If this is the behavior you\u2019re capable of, I\u2019d bet it\u2019s leaked out in other ways before now.", "Maybe the mutual friend is not so obviously petty and self absorbed.", "Just say you're jealous and move on already. Your friend wants you there. If you boycott the wedding, you lose a friend that you don't even deserve. YTA", "Poor baby. And? You are acting like a jealous selfish brat. You aren't mature enough to be a real friend to anyone.", "You made the assumption that you were special enough to be considered for the bridesmaid position for a wedding you made about YOU. YTA", "Time doesn't matter. \n\nYta, you're acting like a whiney brat because you're not getting your way. \n\nShe's better off without you.", "Well considering how petty and entitled you are, she probably likes them better.", "yup. i had a colleague who i became good friends with ask me to be a bridesmaid once. i was surprised because I didn\u2019t see us on quite that level of friendship, but i think she just didn\u2019t have many friends. she\u2019s a sweetheart and I said yes and had a ton of fun. that being said, whenever I get married she\u2019s not on my bridesmaid list. hope it doesn\u2019t cause any problems.", "When I got married one of my bridesmaids kept saying I didn\u2019t need her to be a bridesmaid just because I was one of hers. I told her I asked her because I wanted her to be with me on that day. I would have wanted her with me even if I hadn\u2019t been one of her bridesmaids. The idea that it has to be an even exchange drives me nuts. Yes, sometimes it works out like that but it\u2019s never mandatory", "I didn't try to outdo the bride. \n\nLooking good isn't a crime.", "You have to have members of the new family in your bridal or groom party.", "you intentionally went on a diet, got your hair professionally done, and got a \u201ckiller\u201d dress, to a wedding you were merely a guest to.\n\nlooking good is not a crime. but you literally did everything in your power TO look better than the bride, even altering your body. that\u2019s extreme. \n\nyou can stay petty and bitter, and try to act oblivious to your actions. but it won\u2019t really get you anywhere.", "That's not a real thing. Many people do because they want to, but you don't have to by any stretch.", "No one has to do nothing , but you wanna extend some type of new experience with the other side , right ?"]}
