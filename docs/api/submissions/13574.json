I plan to show him the comments on the post (which I very much appreciate all of your insight). He and I agreed he can take our older child with him this Sunday to mass but I will be staying home with our youngest so he's not diving in with both kids. I plan to update after Sunday morning. \n\nI, 27F, and my Husband 30M have 2 kids. My husband and I both grew up Catholic but had very different experiences within the church growing up, even though we grew up attending the same church with the same community.\n\nHis family was the \"example of a good Catholic family\", parents still married 'happily', a good amount of kids, there every Sunday. For our small farm community they were what others should want to be. (Surface only behind the scenes they are nothing like what they portrayed at church). \n\nI was born out of wedlock by a teen mom and grew up in a broken home. Was adopted but parents later divorced. Due to that I was often the butt of the gossip around the church and was often told to my face that I was going to hell just for being born. But my mom still forced me to go every week Wednesday and Sunday, even though at a young age lead to me coming home crying. She forced me to volunteer and participate in numerous activities to try and \"prove my worth\". \n\nI have ZERO issue with my faith, I still believe in the Catholic religion, my issue is with the church itself. I pray regularly, occasionally listen to mass, but I don't feel like I need to show my face in the building to be \"whole\" and complete in my faith. \n\nRecently my husband's best friend, 29M, got very into religion again after years of nothing. My husband was very proud of him for finding that piece that he (best friend) said was missing. This has also caused my husband to get more involved again, which I don't mind. But now my husband wants us to become that \"Picture perfect Catholic family\" by attending every week in our Sunday best no ifs/ands/or buts.\n\nI talked to him and he says he understands my feelings to a point, but he only knew love and praise from the church so, to his own admission, only somewhat understands. And says we can't shelter our children from God just because I felt abandoned by the community growing up. (We still live in the same area we grew up) I am not trying to keep my kids from God, I plan to teach them, pray with them, etc. But he doesn't think it's enough.

They put on an appearance of being a perfect family, then they go and abuse the wait staff at cracker barrel and don't tip. I'm sure the straight male never had issues with the catholic church. Your experiences as a woman and a child of a  \"not so perfect\" kid are clearly different. \n\nGod forbid your child turns out Queer in any way, it'll take decades of therapy for them to love themselves.  \n\nCan you tell I'm not a fan of the catholic church? \n\nI would never in a million years let my child anywhere near the Catholic church, if it's not a risk of assault, it'll be the irreversible mental damage. It's a cult, plain and simple. \n\nYou can be religious and still avoid the cult church.  \n\nNta.", "NTA\n\nYou were exposed to the hypocrisy of the church. It is real. You have a right to not want your children participating in that. \n\nUnless you agreed to be active in the Catholic Church when you married and agreed to raise your children under that influence, you have no obligation here. There were no false pretenses. \n\nA nondenominational community would be a good compromise. You guys need to get on the same page because such a strong disagreement can hurt your marriage.", "The most important lesson I learned from Catholic mass every Sunday was how to sit quietly for an hour when you're extremely bored.", "NTA.\n\nLet the kids decide if they want to partake in that religion when they are old enough make that decision on their own. \n\nI am not a fan of forcing anyone to partake in any religious activities or practices. It should be a choice. \n\nAnd children's brains are like are sponges, they absorb and often believe everything they are told and taught. So I do sort of view it as brainwashing to an extent if they are being told what to believe in religiously during their entire childhood. That's not right imo.", "NTA. Finding a common ground with different philosophies around faith is something that strikes me as very tricky (and ideally sorted out before you bring kids into a relationship). The unilateral choice that your husband is attempting to make ('no ifs/ands/or buts') is troublesome and frankly not appropriate to a marriage. I mean is he really saying there is only one version of a relationship with God? Of course not. In my view he needs to learn empathy and compromise. Your experience was not his, and it sounds like you actually know his experience was inauthentic and based on a facade of his family that wasn't real. To me, he needs to be more open-minded. \n\nThis requires compromise from you, too. Can you work together to find a church you believe presents a more open-minded community than you had growing up? Can you draw some boundaries as to when you and the kids actually attend (ie it's monthly instead of weekly)? \n\nAnyone who describes wanting to have the 'picture perfect family' frankly raises a flag for me...there is no such thing.", "NTA\nTell your husband that forcing his kids to go to church is the best way to alienate them.", "Religion can make or break a family and your experience has taught you that you don't need a church to prove what's in your heart and soul. Your husbands family proved that appearance isn't everything and there is no reason for you to head down that same path by forcing you to go just to be the \"picture perfect catholic family\". Stick to your faith and stand firm in that you don't need to attend a church every week to prove who you are or what you believe!", "NTA. Everyone practices their faith differently. It could turn out your children won't believe in the same faith you do as well. I would ask your children if they want to go or not. Depending on how old they are...I just know I was forced to go to Sunday school for a period of time until I got so fed up with the church and my parents I would rather stay home doing chores than go. And I never really had a strong faith to begin with, and currently don't follow any religion.", "NTA.\n\n>I talked to him and he says he understands my feelings to a point,\n\n\"No,\" is a complete sentence. He does not have to \"understand.\" His understanding is not required. He does not get to unilaterally decide what your children's religious upbringing looks like. That's a negotiation, something where you find a compromise that you can both live with. \n\nIt is not a case where that unless you \"win\" the argument by convincing him, he gets to decide. \n\nAnd while you're probably going to have to be okay with your kids showing up sometimes at Church on Sunday (compromise works both ways, after all) - you never have to go if you don't want to. That's his thing. \"Tried that, it's not for me.\" \n\nAnd if he doesn't like the fact that you don't look like a \"picture perfect Catholic family\" if you're not there will bells on every week, that's his problem. He can channel that frustration into changing the Church, making it more responsive to the needs of people like you.", "Info: how old are your kids?", "NTA  \n\nSeems like you\u2019re trying to compromise but he just wants his way. I would say it\u2019s pretty pointless to take your kids if they\u2019re under the age of 6-7. They wont like it, they\u2019ll probably cry, and I doubt they\u2019ll actually appreciate anything. He should respect your experiences and feelings. If he can\u2019t understand or respect feelings that he\u2019s never experienced himself, he\u2019s lacking in empathy.", "NTA.  Like you, I was exposed to very religious rigor as I grew up.  However, as I grew older my experience grew more negative towards the church (Lutheran).  You learn that people are not perfect; the earthly saints are actually human.  A good review of the history of the catholic (and Lutheran) church would make most people cringe and question their faith.  Again, what you learn is that the saints are human.\n\nUnfortunately, an old saying that I heard regularly growing up in the church is that they, \"shoot their wounded first\".  Another one I heard was that we \"should keep our eyes on God, not man\".  What we should do is learn to respect and love each other for who and what we are.", "NTA\n\nHe should be happy you even still believe. I know so many former Catholics (myself & brothers included) who were so turned off by the church they don't even believe anymore, if they ever did. If you're going to the same church where you were judged and mistreated, your husband should understand why you don't want to go or subject your children to that \"community.\" He clearly doesn't see the hypocrisy of some Catholics.", "NTA. As a Christian, you can\u2019t force religion onto anyone. If you or your kids don\u2019t want to go, don\u2019t go. However, these conversations can be quite sensitive and are important to have before you get to this point", "I'm not even gonna read this because I trust I can say definitely NTA strictly based on the title.", "NTA . Can't you come to a workable compromise with your Husband until your kids are old enough to make their own decision ?", "INFO how old are the kids? Can they make the decision whether or not to attend on their own? Because if they're old enough this shouldn't even be a conversation between yall you should be asking them if they even want to attend. \n\nThat all being said NTA, he cannot force you to go anywhere or do anything. Just because he's gotten more serious in the faith doesn't mean you should be expected to follow along. If he has an issue with that, that's his own problem", "NTA. Is there any real difference in pushing them one way or the other, but you are not pushing them from God or even making them look at all the facts of that church community. Your husband is not respecting you by making you ignore your experiences with these same people. I know each one road town has about eight churches because congregations keep having disagreements. Is there another Catholic church in the town? I doubt it is about faith and not posturing or he would agree to that for your peace of mind.", "NTA.\n\nYour trauma is valid and you're very rational for definitely your issues not being with a god but with the fandom.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with not wanting to participate in a facade. No one is perfect and trying to pretend to be in any sense of the word just contributes to the false idea that there is only one way to go about anything in life. It also puts a lot of undue pressure to uphold that facade. One of the kids isn't feeling and acts up and suddenly OP is a bad mom. It's absurd, and I don't blame you for not wanting to participate. Or one of them asks a legitimate question in Sunday school that annoys the teacher and now you have a house of sin. Exhausting.\n\nA compromise should be made. He's never going to understand your feelings so you're going to have to find ways around that. No one can tell you how you should worship. If his pressure is causing you to question your faith or resent it because he's telling you getting dressed up every Sunday is the only way to believe in your god, then he's got bigger problems. This pressure is also a bad influence on your kids - it teaches them that this is the only way to be a good Catholic and everyone who doesn't do this song and dance is a bad Catholic. Then they grow up to be judgemental assholes (or have their own religious trauma because they realized god doesn't exist and left the church but will still carry that guilt around with them for the rest of their life because it was shoved into their heads from a young age).\n\nBut if you end up back in the pews, keep your head up high and use your experience as armor. You know what to expect, you know how much those folks love to gossip and judge. Hell, control the situation and intentionally give them something to gossip about with a wry smile - be Bree Van de Kamp.", "INFO: Does it have to be the same church? Also, light a fire under the priest as clearly his sermons aren't getting through to some people.", "NTA \n\nOrganized religion is the biggest problem with religion. \n\nAlso, your kids are too young to know what they do or do not believe in. That\u2019s a choice that for them is a good ways off.", "NTA\n\nCringe.\n\nYour husband has to own that the church was a bad place for you. \n\nYou can agree to go for holiday services but no more.", "NTA, if I were you I would throw it back in his face and say traditionally it\u2019s mom\u2019s job to guide the faith of the kids and he needs to butt out (but then again I\u2019m petty, you seem to be a bit more level headed). By his own admission he doesn\u2019t understand your perspective, which tells me he doesn\u2019t have a lot of empathy or compassion for what you went through. He can keep his mouth shut until he develops some perspective", "NTA.  He can take the kids if he wants, but he can't force you to do anything.  And if I were you, you wouldn't catch me dead in the church.  In fact given your experience, I would say it's important for you to be an example of how faith can look when you aren't being influenced by The Establishment.  I hope this works out OK for you, but your husband is waving some serious red flags with his demand.", "NTA, Christians are causing a trans genocide in this country.
