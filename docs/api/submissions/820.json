{"id": 820, "submission_id": "yj89zl", "title": "AITA because I won't buy my MIL a carseat?", "selftext": "My husband (m30) and I (f28) have a son(m19months). He goes to daycare 3 days a week and usually gets picked up by my grandma (f78). She is his main caregiver when we are both working. She purchased a carseat, with my help, so that she could pick him up and to have for emergencies. My MIL (f63) does not watch my son often. She has stated many times she does not want to have baby things in her car or house. She is our last resort when it comes to babysitting. \n\nYesterday I needed MIL to watch my son after daycare because my grandma had doctor appointments. I asked MIL two weeks in advance so that I didn't interfere with her schedule. Grandma offered up her carseat because MIL does not have one. MIL was supposed to leave carseat at my house so I could give it back to grandma. She refuses to learn how to put the carseat in her car. She makes my husband or me take it in and out. So she did not return the carseat to grandma. This morning I had to leave my carseat at daycare so grandma could pick up my son.\n\nI asked my husband to please talk to MIL about getting a carseat because we are playing musical cars and it's not fair that she kept grandma's carseat that grandma paid for. Husband wants me to send the type of carseat to him so he can buy it for MIL. I refused saying she can spend her own money and do her own research on the carseat. (Obviously I would make sure it was a safe model before I let her take my son). He says I'm being unreasonable and all I have to do is send the model and he'll take care of it. Am I the Asshole because I won't help her get a carseat?\n\n\nThis is a petty edit: but to go along with her not wanting to do baby things. She refuses to give my son Tylenol when he has an ear infection because he \"will ruin his kidneys\". And won't follow guidelines I give her as far as food. Yes I should not have her babysit but when it comes down to me calling off of work or her picking him up from daycare, I would hope she could be a decent person and do me a favor. I may be entitled by asking her to buy a carseat but I didn't want to bog down this post with personal feelings.\n\nFinal edit: I get it, IATAH because I won't buy the seat. However thanks to your comments we will be re-evaluating how much we use MIL as a pick up/drop off person (even if it is only 5 times a year). In the end this was the straw that broke the camel's back in my dealings with MIL. While it's a weird hill to die on it was my breaking point, but not the best one.\n Thanks to everyone that thinks I force my 78 year old grandma baby sit when it's the happiest she's been in years. I truly hope you guys don't have grandchildren and expect your kids to pay you to spend time with them.

I have loaned them a carseat, or, when it is more convenient, purchased a carseat for use at their house.  It would never even occur to me that they would buy a carseat.  Why would someone else be responsible for paying to do ME a favor???\n\nAs for griping about installing the carseat - I can't install a carseat.  If mine has to come out of my car for any reason, and my husband or another strong person isn't around to reinstall it, I take it to the fire station.  Again, would never occur to me that my elderly mother would be able to install a carseat.  Her weak fingers struggle to unbuckle the latch just to get the kids out of their straps.  She can't install a seat!  \n\nLook, you may have loads of other justified problems with your MIL.  But you are completely out of line saying she should be PAYING for a carseat in order to babysit YOUR child.", "YTA. This is somewhat entitled of you. MIL was doing you a FAVOUR. Family members or not, nobody is obliged to care for/pay for your child. Only YOU and YOUR HUSBAND made the decision to have a child. Nobody else got a say in it, or the costs/responsibilities that come with it.\n\nSure, family members will often do you FAVOURS to help you out (even though it's not a requirement). But requiring them to pay for expensive items, so they can DO YOU A FAVOUR, is spoilt behaviour. It should be you and your husband providing the necessary equipment, to care for your child. She had already given you her time to help you out. \n\nYet you arrogantly demand MIL should be spending yet more time researching car seats, and then forking out significant money to buy one. And this is all because you found it slightly inconvenient having to take your own car seat to daycare (where you were going anyway). She probably just forgot to return the carseat, as none of this is part of her routine (since you rarely let her babysit). \n\nSo why not address that reasonably (like just sending a text reminder next time, around the time you know she needs to remember to return the carseat)? You instead decide you're unnecessarily entitled to more of her time and money, to make a point (and yes, I do think you're trying to make a point to her, with that demand). All because she caused you minor inconvenience - WHILST YOU WERE CAUSING HER 3 HOURS OF INCONVENIENCE. \n\nYou also lazily dismiss MIL as 'only' spending 3 hours looking after your child, as if that's not a big chunk of her day. You really do think people 'owe you', for the 'privilege' of helping you out - don't you?!\nI also think your negativity towards MIL really shows through, in comments like 'she refuses to learn how to put the car seat in the car' (and boo hoo, that causes you yet another minor inconvenience, of doing it yourself). \n\nYou make it sound as if she is doing that maliciously/too be difficult - when in reality, she's probably just scared of getting it wrong and your son then being at risk. You're acting entitled, overly-negative, and spoilt. Your grandmother won't be around/in good health for ever, so be careful which bridges you burn. If someone demanded I fork out significant amounts of money for their 'convenience' whilst DOING THEM THE FAVOUR, I wouldn't be keen to help them again.", "YTA.   \n\n\nI have a 9-month-old. My mother (64) graciously watches her so I can go to work. I bought an infant seat with three bases: one for my car, one for my partners car, and one for my mom's car. \n\nWhen the baby got too big for my mom to comfortably carry in the seat, I told her to leave the carseat wherever and I would happy handle moving it to the correct car. \n\nWhen she tried the stroller I got and it was a little bulky for her, we went out and I bought her an umbrella stroller to use that she liked. \n\nWhen she saw me carrying the baby in a carrier, she tried it, too, and liked it, so I bought her one.   \n\n\nWhen the baby needs to upgrade to a bigger seat from her infant seat, I'll be buying two: one for my car, and one for my mom's car.   \n\n\nBecause I want my child to be safe, my mom to be comfortable, and my gratitude to be obvious.", "YTA.

Your son will grow out of that size before long and for the maybe few times a year it seems she would need one, what\u2019s the point.

To me, it seems like you just force her in a way to help you in emergency and she just gives in reluctantly as she doesn't have much choice then. The emergencies are your concern only as he is your child, nobody else have to help you if they are not willing to. You should start looking for a babysitter for such emergencies and leave your MIL alone. She can visit her grandchild when she wants by coming over to your home. She is allowed to have the kind of relationship she desires to have with her grandchild. She is well within her rights to establish boundaries which in this case is no babysitting.

I asked MIL two weeks in advance so that I didn't interfere with her schedule. Grandma offered up her carseat because MIL does not have one. MIL was supposed to leave carseat at my house so I could give it back to grandma. She refuses to learn how to put the carseat in her car. She makes my husband or me take it in and out. So she did not return the carseat to grandma. This morning I had to leave my carseat at daycare so grandma could pick up my son.\n\nI asked my husband to please talk to MIL about getting a carseat because we are playing musical cars and it's not fair that she kept grandma's carseat that grandma paid for. Husband wants me to send the type of carseat to him so he can buy it for MIL. I refused saying she can spend her own money and do her own research on the carseat.
