I am in grad school and I have a decent paying job but not decent enough to live on my own. I live with my aunt and I go back to my home (where my parents live) every other weekend and on holiday breaks. I am also budgeting and saving strictly to move out on my own.\n\nI feel like I should mention that my dad runs his own business that has been failing for decades. He is not a provider for our family because most of his money goes to something related to his business, fast food, or his mild gambling addiction. I\u2019m not sure how him and my mom split the bills but I know she pays most of them and they are constantly struggling to stay afloat.\n\nMy dad has asked me for money before and I have given it to him. Typically he asks for about $200-$300 dollars. Last time I gave it to him he \u201cpromised\u201d that he would give it back to me by the end of the week and he didn\u2019t pay me back for months. This is a common pattern for him in all areas of life. He will beg and plead and \u201cpromise\u201d to do something and he never does it. \n\nThis time when he called (btw he only ever calls when he wants something), it was the same old story: \u201cI\u2019m in a rough spot\u201d, \u201cI get paid next week\u201d, \u201cI promise\u201d blah blah blah. I told him the lie and he replied with an attitude saying \u201dI guess I\u2019m just stuck then\u201d. I asked him why he doesn\u2019t just ask my mom. He replied with \u201cI don\u2019t want to fuss with her over a couple of dollars\u201d. To me that meant that he knows he\u2019s not going to pay this money back on time and I\u2019m less likely to give him shit about it than my mom. Everyone knows that I don\u2019t like to chase people down for money and I feel like he\u2019s taking advantage of that.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering why I lied instead of just saying no, it\u2019s because my dad never excepts no for an answer and would\u2019ve for sure tried to argue with me and make me feel guilty. I feel bad because my dad got me the car that I drive now about 2 years ago(used, no car payments) so I feel like I owe him. I also feel bad because I had the money but I don\u2019t like the constant lying and manipulation. I\u2019m sure he knows I lied because now he\u2019s giving me the cold shoulder.

You said he has a failing business and a gambling addiction. Your money is being spent on these things if your mother is paying the household bills. If you want to help financially then pay a bill in the house directly and don\u2019t give it to either parent because your mother enables your father\u2019s dysfunction. However, be careful giving them money regularly because you don\u2019t want them to start expecting you to do this all the time. While it\u2019s true that the way they run their household and relationship is not your business you need to have a conversation about your father\u2019s constant money grubbing and his deficits. Tell them both that you are not going to keep helping when he keeps making the mistakes he\u2019s making. He needs a real job and addiction therapy. These are things your mother should have demanded years ago."]}
