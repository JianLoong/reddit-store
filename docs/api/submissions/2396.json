Thanks for your opinions, I really want input before making a decision because I am hurt at the moment and wouldn\u2019t want to be unfair.\n\nSo I (female very early 20s) live with my parents (it\u2019s not normal or usual to move out until late 20s or 30s here). Our relationship isn\u2019t the best and I\u2019ve been advised to move out before, I might, honestly.\n\nMy uncle cheated on his wife about 1,5-2 years ago and she threw him out (obviously). We took him in and housed all of his belongings (a lot, I had to give up my office room) until he could get back on his feet, gladly. Because he lost his wife and step daughter, he didn\u2019t have anyone to spend some holidays with and we instantly told him to spend it with us (he used to spend some days w wife\u2019s fam and others with us. Now more with us). All this feels normal and the right thing to do to me, because we could do it and had the space. I wouldn\u2019t expect anything in return, ever. I wouldn\u2019t even expect a \u201cthank you\u201d because it was implied.\n\nLast year my bday happened during a low point for him, and he forgot. I was hurt because he is family and I wanted a happy birthday text, if not a call, but I never showed it because he wasn\u2019t doing ok and helping him was a priority. \n\nThis year, he has a gf. I haven\u2019t met her but this info is important i think. He has been asking favors from us (my mom to help him with some finances for his business, favors to get out of doing his share of work to take care of grandma, and other financial and personal favors). I always said yes because he is family. \n\nWell, he forgot my bday again. Not a text, not a call. I was extremely hurt but didn\u2019t say anything because what would I say? Today, he came to my house and I thought he\u2019d say something. He just came to ask more favors, to which my parents said yes but I stayed out. I didn\u2019t expect or want any presents, but just a happy bday. He was here, talking to me, and didn\u2019t even suspect it had been my bday.\n\nI informed my mom I didn\u2019t want him over for the holidays this year, and that I won\u2019t attend if he comes. He can stay with his gf for all I care, since that is all he cares about (he won\u2019t be alone). She said she can\u2019t not invite him and I said it was fine and I would just not attend dinner because that\u2019s not what family is to me. I also realised that his ex wife always remembered my bdays and special ocassions, but not him. He is my only uncle and godfather. For his bday, we threw him a party with friends and family and I baked his fave cake and bought him a gift. My mom says I\u2019m too dramatic and an AH, but this is normal for her, so I don\u2019t trust her judgment.\n\nI may be letting my anger get the best of me, but I don\u2019t want someone so selfish around.

Instead, you are choosing to direct your aggression onto your mother to try to force \\*her\\* to have a confrontation with him.  Your post makes it sound as if you are punishing her because you don't like that she does so much for him and also don't like that \\*you\\* feel obligated to do so much for him.\n\nIt's fine for you to have these feelings - it's not fine for you to try to force your mother to fight your battles for you.  Try to separate your issues with your mother and your uncle, and have the difficult conversations - set some boundaries and requirements and let them know what you need from them.", "YWBTA. You're an adult; no one cares about your birthday anymore. This is an extremely childish reason to try to get someone kicked out of a holiday celebration.", "YWBTA. You\u2019re being insanely immature. Birthdays aren\u2019t that important. Get over yourself.", "INFO Does your uncle remember anyone's birthday? Did you remind him this year or last year? Did you talk about your upcoming birthday? How close are you? I think my parents remind relatives of my birthday if they are going to be around during my birthday.

I wouldn\u2019t expect anything in return, ever. I wouldn\u2019t even expect a \u201cthank you\u201d because it was implied.\n\nSo based on this you had no problem with him staying and did not want or expect a thank you. In comments you say you psy for the house and groceries but didn't mention that in your post. So if he doesn't thank you specifically it may be because he doesn't think you had anything to do with him staying there.", "YWBTA...I'm not sure why you think you have authority in someone else's house.

So instead of silently fuming about it your entire birthday and then forevermore, while they remain oblivious, use your words and remind them it's your birthday. Better yet, remind your uncle in advance, since you already know from experience that he forgets. To uninvite someone from holidays because they forgot your precious little day is very dramatic and self-centred.", "YWBTA- instead of just cutting him off, maybe talk to him about it. \n\nYou are reacting quite immaturely and this can be handled without un inviting someone from a family event. Or refusing to go. \n\nIt\u2019s a birthday, it\u2019s not like he refused to show up to your wedding day, or a once in a lifetime event.

The world doesn\u2019t revolve around you and your bday. You can throw you little temper tantrum and not attend dinner but just know that it makes you look incredibly immature and childish.

Forgotten birthdays hurt, but it doesn\u00b4t make not inviting someone for Christmas justified. If you want the birthday wish, tell him that they mean a lot to you and you would love to get a wish from him too. You can\u00b4t punish someone for something they don\u00b4t even know they did wrong.", "YTA - I find it weird that an adult is so hang up on a birthday. That\u2019s how a 5 year old would behave.", "Ywbta because YOU NEVER SAID ANYTHING. Also, remembering your birthday and family holidays are not directly related things. You are kind of trying to make a martyr of yourself but you haven\u2019t had a conversation with him. Maybe he used to remember because his ex would remind him. You can\u2019t get mad repeatedly and ban him without him even knowing he did something wrong. Now, if you tell him you are upset because he forgot you\u2019d birthday two years in a row, and he is a jerk about it, then that is different. Try just sitting down and having an honest conversation with him.", "NTA", "NTA it\u2019s understandable that you would be upset that he did not recognize your birthday, however it speaks volumes that you realized his ex always remembered. It\u2019s possible that she was the only reason he ever remembered in the first place. I can tell you I was the one to remind my husband to call his Mom on her birthday, I was the one to get Mother\u2019s Day gifts/cards, etc. Yes, you would think it would be important for him to remember because it would mean (to you, anyway) you are important to him but it may just be he\u2019s clueless and focused on mooching from your parents (apparently).  The problem I see here is you\u2019re spending all your time and energy on removing this person from your life for what you feel is a major slight to you and he probably has no clue you even feel this way. Expecting your parents to exclude him because he forgot your birthday is a bit entitled considering the man cheated on his wife which shows what lack of character he possesses, if I were to boycott family activities it would be for that, not because he didn\u2019t wish me a happy birthday.", "I'm gonna disagree with other comments and say NTA. But I don't think you should skip out on the holidays. I don't think it's right to just deny your feelings because your names not on the mortgage.

He never insulted, assaulted you or whatever. \nI must also say that many men rely on women to remind them or birthdays like they're their personal assistant.

Demanding is never okay. Discussing is just fine.\n\nIf your parents do not see your pov then go out and make the most of it for yourself. You have the right to spend your holiday as you wish.\n\n\nGood luck.", "YWBTA it\u2019s asking a lot for people to remember your birthday, especially if they have a lot going on. If you insist on holding people to this arbitrary standard, you are going to be utterly hurt and disappointed by lots of well-meaning, caring people throughout your life. Spread goodwill instead of creating bad, let it go, enjoy the holiday with family.", "YTA- It\u2019s okay to feel hurt that he misses out on your milestones but, you just have to accept that these events aren\u2019t as important to him as they are to you. Now that you\u2019re an adult, fewer and fewer people are going to care about celebrating your birthday. That\u2019s just life. As hurtful as his behavior is to you, it really doesn\u2019t justify casting him out of an important family holiday, which would make the holiday less enjoyable for the rest of your family for the drama it would cause.", "YTA\n\nIt seems obvious the ex wife was giving him reminders. Ofc he remembers his parents and siblings birthdays, he grew up with them.\n\nI don\u2019t know any of my aunts, uncles or cousins bday. Maybe I am just a shitty relative. \n\nNot to mention you\u2019re not even going g to address the issue with him about what is bothering you, you just want to passive aggressively un-invite him.", "ESH. While you can be upset that someone who is close to you forgot your birthday 2 years in a row, when you have been there for them, you can not ask them to be removed from the family over it.\n\nIs it shitty he forgot? Yes\nIs it shitty he seems to be taking advantage of your family\u2019s kindness? Yes\nBut you should be an adult and voice that he hurt your feelings, or nothing will change. How do you expect it to if not talked about? \nIts also shitty you are putting your heels in the sand over a birthday. Its not that deep.", "NTA.  I get that there are a lot of people here saying that adults \"shouldn't care about their birthdays\".  Why not.  I don't like mine but my wife loves hers.  We do her's up big time when it comes around and we play mine low key.\n\nThat's not to say she doesn't understand why I don't like more attention on mine.  If your birthday is important to you then it is important to you.  You are allowed to place whatever importance you wish on it.  \n\nIt sounds like you are not being ridiculous about it.  You let your mother know your preference and she told you that you would be missed.  There isn't anything wrong with that on either side however I could see where you might feel a bit betrayed.  \n\nSetting boundaries with others is an adult thing to do.  Whether or not someone understands your boundaries is unimportant.  If they want you in their lives they will abide by them.  If they find the boundaries to onerous then they with walk away.  Nothing wrong with either scenario, so long as we respect one another.", "Heck my mom often forgets my birthday and I still include her at the holidays. YWBTA, get over it.", "NTA for how you are feeling but the best strategy is just to not celebrate your uncle's birthday anymore if he doesn't celebrate yours instead of forcing your parents not to invite to the holiday celebrations", "You know what I would be upset too if I had a family member who expects favours and a fuss made of their birthdays but can't even be bothered to acknowledge yours.

He forgot your birthday????   What a fiend!", "Um, you are an adult. Why are you not talking to the other adult in this situation about your hurt feelings?

It's a bit childish to get mad that ppl don't remember your birthday, then to try and punish them because they don't live up to your standards.  Time to grow up", "Yta.. is it your house or your parents house. Because you seem to be telling your parents who they can have at their house . And OMG he forgot my birthday, you're an adult not 12. You even said he was in a bad way, do you always control your parents household, people have told you to move out before you may want to listen to them", "I'm surprised to see so many people saying you would be t A. I think you WNBTA. Your uncle sounds seriously selfish and my feelings would be hurt too in the scenarios you've described. But maybe instead of going with the nuclear option right now, ask him if the two of you can talk one-on-one, and tell him how much his actions and forgetting your birthday has hurt you. He sounds clueless. If he apologizes in that hypothetical, would that be enough to mend fences? At any rate, happy birthday from an internet stranger!", "Wow your level of pettiness is amazing. Nobody cares about your birthday, grow up", "NTA. It sounds like birthdays and holidays are important in your family, but for some reason your getting left behind.

My father hasn't acknowledged by birthday for over 20 years (before this year). No call, texts, facebook posts, nothing.  However he has not missed my brother in law's birthday once. The best part, my BIL and I share a birthday. I used to let this ruin my day. Eventually I decided that you can't change others. This year, he gave me a card... it was 4 days late, but he got me one. I don't know what changed, but it was appreciated. Might never happen again. \n\nOP - YWBTA.  If you are feeling hurt, talk to your Uncle. But don't make your mom choose between you guys' or start a war that is not hers to fight. It might also be helpful to note - does he forget other peoples birthdays or is it just yours? As you can probably tell from the replies on your post, birthdays are just not important to some people.", ">You're an adult; no one cares about your birthday anymore\n\nI was thinking the same thing, but then I saw some of OP's comments.  This man remembers other people's birthdays, but repeatedly forgets her's.  And it sounds like this attitude extends beyond OP's birthday, even though she's gone out of her way to support her uncle in the past.  \n\nAlso, she's on the deed the house and pay's half the expenses.  So really she is also hosting the holiday.\n\nI don't think her solution to exclude him is the best, but with the additional information, this definitely seems like an ESH situation, rather than OP just being the AH.", "I see a lot of this attitude here. If you are an adult you should not care about your birthday and are juvenile if you do. Why? I don't get it. My wife and I are in our 70s and enjoy celebrating our birthday. If you don't I think that is sad but you do you.

Part of you is letting your anger of him forgetting your birthday in the way of thinking about anything else.

That\u2019s why you see it live, then not, then yes. If I wanted to, I could eliminate it AND hide it from everyone. Silly thought.", "I think you may want to revise your post and add some context.  Because from your comments, it's not JUST your birthday he's missing.  It's a completely a one-sided familial relationship, where you are putting in all the effort and receiving nothing in return (not even a simple happy birthday).  It's even worse that he puts in some effort for others, at least to remember their birthdays.  That puts everything in a whole different context.\n\nAll relationships (romantic, familial, friendship, business, etc.) are two-way streets.  And in my opinion (so take that for what it's worth, if anything) if someone isn't going to invest any effort into the relationship, it's not the best move to then over-invest your time and effort.  All it does is build resentment.  Rather, you need to decide if you want to invest the same time and energy into him, when you know he won't return that investment.   \n\nHowever, I don't think dis-inviting him the holiday is the proper solution.   You can both attend, with you being politely disinterested."]}
