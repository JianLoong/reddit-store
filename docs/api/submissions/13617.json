Due to this on multiple occasions arguments have started between me and her over this topic.\n\nMore recently we got into a fight, she was going to make the same bland, low-calorie gluten free \"pasta\" that we must have at least twice a week at this point in time. When I was told she was making this for dinner again I finally decided to talk to her about it. The conversation went something like this:\n\n(Me) \"Hey I really want to talk to you about dinner tonight.\" (Mom) \"Ok? what do we need talk about\" (Me) \"I am not trying to be disrespectful but your dinners are not working for me, I need high calorie foods like bread, etc.\" (Mom) \"Then make them yourself I am not going to make two separate dinners especially for someone who is ungrateful for my cooking\" (Me) \"Ok, can we please go to the store so I can grab some stuff to make it?\" (We barely have anything non-gluten-free or high-cal like potatoes) (Mom) \"I'm not going to take someone to the store who is rude to me.\" (Me) \"Why?? I wasn't trying to be disrespectful to you, I'm sorry if I was.\" (Mom) \"Doesn't matter if you meant to, you were still rude to me; the answer is still no.\"\n\nAfter this I came back \\~30 minutes later (Me) \"Hey, im sorry about earlier can we please go to the store so I can make dinner for myself?\" (Her) \"NO, you don't get to come out here and pretend like you were not rude to me and then ask me to drive you somewhere\" After this, I knew it was going nowhere so I went into the kitchen and made myself a simple bowl with like half a packet of tofu and some onions.\n\nI feel like im not an asshole but I cant shake the feeling that I might be, so Reddit, AITA???", "created_utc": 1680224952, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1275ecu/aita_for_being_rude_to_my_mom_because_she_forces/", "score": 975, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If so, you are still in a normal range for weight. So I wouldn\u2019t get too worried about that. If not, that\u2019s pretty concerning that your mother would be so selfish. I have noticed throughout my life that many of those who have struggled with weight most of their lives who get thin after 40 become absolutely obsessed not only with themselves but with their family and friends.

Also he is always considerate and mostly eats vegan with me.\n\nOur kid is also mostly on a vegetarian/vegan diet, but if she likes a boiled egg or some chicken I would never say no. It's her choice.\n\nYour mother... As you say, she is forcing everything on you guys. Also it's proven that for a person who is able to eat gluten it's BAD not to consume it. As bad it's for a person who can't digest it, as bad it's the other way round. Its perfectly ok and normal to eat something else, if your needs are different.\n\nPlease talk to your father and go together to your mom, working something out. For example, she cooks her meal and you guys cook for yourselves. You can also partly eat the same, like steamed vegetables is a good side for every kind of diet.\n\nIf this is not possible, try to approach her again, but prepared and lay out your arguments. Tell her, you would like to try cooking for yourself and see if it helps gaining weight.\n\nIf she is still not able to negotiate, I would talk to another trustable adult, like a teacher, but this could lead to CPS/youth welfare (? not sure) on your door step.", "this.

You need more food than you are eating right now.", "As someone who was 5\u20195 and 90 lbs in highschool cause of my mom\u2019s insistence that the whole family follow her paleo diet, NTA. I wasn\u2019t nearly this polite to my mom about it (granted I held in any criticism until I was in 9th grade\u2026she\u2019s been on the diet since I was in 4th grade.) But I was (still am) naturally pretty slender. And that quickly turned into downright stickish. I lost any desire to eat, and became incredibly resentful towards both my mom and food. (Partially cause I was tired of the same foods over and over again and they weren\u2019t enough for my growing body with a high metabolism, and partially cause I was bullied a lot in school for my \u201cweird foods\u201d at lunch) I would go days without food sometimes, out right refusing anything she offered me. She finally realized something was really wrong when I dropped from 115 to 90 pounds over the course of my junior year. I expressed concern for my health and she finally listened. Now whenever I come visit (I moved out since then) she makes sure she doesn\u2019t make any of the food that I still to this day really struggle to eat. Tbh I\u2019d be happy if she made gluten free pasta. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to eat sweet potatoes, spinach, cauliflower, or salmon cakes ever again and she\u2019s accepted that she fed me that literally every single day for 7 years and now I hate it. Anyway. This has been kinda rambly, but food broke my relationship with my mom for a while. It\u2019s still healing. I\u2019ve recovered physically. I\u2019m a healthy 120 lbs and I\u2019ve been starting to weight life to gain some meat on my bones lol. \n\n\nYou did a great job of politely telling your mother your needs aren\u2019t being met.

My son is, and always has been, underweight. His dad has recently had health issues and needs to be on a strict diet. This is healthy for everyone in his house except my son ( we\u2019re divorced). He\u2019s not going overboard, but I ensure my house is filled with high caloric, nutrient dense foods to compensate. Different bodies have different needs and it\u2019s the parents job to accommodate that. At 15, I think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable for you to prepare your own food, but it must be provided by your parents. Eat what she makes, plus a sandwich for example. I\u2019ll make chicken salad for everyone, then add grilled cheese sandwiches for the kids, as another east accommodation.", "NTA  \nGet you doctor involved.

Please speak with a trusted adult (preferably someone at your school) about your mother\u2019s unwillingness to provide you with an adequate meal. This is bordering on child abuse and your father is enabling it by simply choosing to not shop rather than argue with your mother. It\u2019s perfectly fine for her to diet. It is not okay for her to malnourish her children by forcing them to keep the same nutrient deficient diet.
