When I was told she was making this for dinner again I finally decided to talk to her about it. The conversation went something like this:\n\n(Me) \"Hey I really want to talk to you about dinner tonight.\" (Mom) \"Ok? what do we need talk about\" (Me) \"I am not trying to be disrespectful but your dinners are not working for me, I need high calorie foods like bread, etc.\" (Mom) \"Then make them yourself I am not going to make two separate dinners especially for someone who is ungrateful for my cooking\" (Me) \"Ok, can we please go to the store so I can grab some stuff to make it?\" (We barely have anything non-gluten-free or high-cal like potatoes) (Mom) \"I'm not going to take someone to the store who is rude to me.\" (Me) \"Why?? I wasn't trying to be disrespectful to you, I'm sorry if I was.\" (Mom) \"Doesn't matter if you meant to, you were still rude to me; the answer is still no.\"\n\nAfter this I came back \\~30 minutes later (Me) \"Hey, im sorry about earlier can we please go to the store so I can make dinner for myself?\" (Her) \"NO, you don't get to come out here and pretend like you were not rude to me and then ask me to drive you somewhere\" After this, I knew it was going nowhere so I went into the kitchen and made myself a simple bowl with like half a packet of tofu and some onions.\n\nI feel like im not an asshole but I cant shake the feeling that I might be, so Reddit, AITA???", "created_utc": 1680224952, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1275ecu/aita_for_being_rude_to_my_mom_because_she_forces/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Gluten free pasta, bread, etc. are often more calorie dense than their wheat originals.

Then he understood what I was going through when his younger siblings went through it.\n\nNow, that being said your mom is being selfish. No kid wants to eat a boring diet if they don\u2019t need to.

Then ask her if you both can compromise so that a few nights a week you can make your own food and you can go grocery shopping with her. \n\nAlso, are you a biological female? If so, you are still in a normal range for weight. So I wouldn\u2019t get too worried about that. If not, that\u2019s pretty concerning that your mother would be so selfish. I have noticed throughout my life that many of those who have struggled with weight most of their lives who get thin after 40 become absolutely obsessed not only with themselves but with their family and friends.

I get the knee issues. \n\nSo as a mom, someone who grew up with a similar mom as yours and dealt with my own issues with food I think maybe the approach of talking to her about how you both actually have a lot in common would be a good one.
