Due to this on multiple occasions arguments have started between me and her over this topic.\n\nMore recently we got into a fight, she was going to make the same bland, low-calorie gluten free \"pasta\" that we must have at least twice a week at this point in time. When I was told she was making this for dinner again I finally decided to talk to her about it. The conversation went something like this:\n\n(Me) \"Hey I really want to talk to you about dinner tonight.\" (Mom) \"Ok? what do we need talk about\" (Me) \"I am not trying to be disrespectful but your dinners are not working for me, I need high calorie foods like bread, etc.\" (Mom) \"Then make them yourself I am not going to make two separate dinners especially for someone who is ungrateful for my cooking\" (Me) \"Ok, can we please go to the store so I can grab some stuff to make it?\" (We barely have anything non-gluten-free or high-cal like potatoes) (Mom) \"I'm not going to take someone to the store who is rude to me.\" (Me) \"Why?? I wasn't trying to be disrespectful to you, I'm sorry if I was.\" (Mom) \"Doesn't matter if you meant to, you were still rude to me; the answer is still no.\"\n\nAfter this I came back \\~30 minutes later (Me) \"Hey, im sorry about earlier can we please go to the store so I can make dinner for myself?\" (Her) \"NO, you don't get to come out here and pretend like you were not rude to me and then ask me to drive you somewhere\" After this, I knew it was going nowhere so I went into the kitchen and made myself a simple bowl with like half a packet of tofu and some onions.\n\nI feel like im not an asshole but I cant shake the feeling that I might be, so Reddit, AITA???", "created_utc": 1680224952, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1275ecu/aita_for_being_rude_to_my_mom_because_she_forces/", "score": 325, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If so, you are still in a normal range for weight. So I wouldn\u2019t get too worried about that. If not, that\u2019s pretty concerning that your mother would be so selfish. I have noticed throughout my life that many of those who have struggled with weight most of their lives who get thin after 40 become absolutely obsessed not only with themselves but with their family and friends.

Her issues with her weight do not give her license to severely restrict your food intake like this, especially if you\u2019re underweight!\n\n\nOne thing you could consider is looking into buying your Mom some GF cookbooks that have heftier, better-balanced meals with the nutrients and calories broken down to show her they are still healthy. There are several out there :)", "NTA. I might be TA, because I think CPS could have a say in this. Not saying that you should (although you could) call Child Protective Services .. but your BOTH parent should be aware that they are in the wrong, including legally. No, I'm not exaggerating, your mother's diet is making you ill. Plus the psychological effects, a lot of anorexic girls' nightmare  started with their mother's weigh obsession.", "NTA", "Will your dad lend you his card for instacart? This way he can approve your shopping list without having to drive you anywhere", "NTA, are you still in school, could you talk with the  school nurse about your weight?", "NTA and it\u2019s very unhealthy to force a gluten free diet in someone who doesn\u2019t need it. It can lead to you developing an intolerance. Make sure you\u2019re eating real bread and pasta whenever you can to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen and maybe speak to your Dad and get him on your side. Your mum is in the wrong for forcing her diet on the family.", "While non-celiacs don't need to cut out gluten a gluten free diet isn't necessesarily unhealthy. As a celiac I eat healthier than my gluten-eating family. There are many gluten free wholegrains, like buckwheat, quinoa, sorghum, etc. There are healthy and unhealthy gluten free foods, just like there are healthy and unhealthy gluten containing foods.", "exactly! and OP wants potatoes which are gluten free.", "You sound thick as fuck", "Is ordering groceries online an option? If you can, ask you parents to set that up for you.", "Just wondering if it's possible to negotiate your own budget they pay you every week/month and cook your own food a chunk of the time. Then you can decide which shopping trips to join ahead of time. \n\nObviously it'd be ideal if your parents gave up this idiocy, but it might be a way around it if you can get them to agree. Can throw in something about learning life skills like budgeting and cooking.", "You dad is a grown man he is not forced to do anything but rather sounds like he does for a quite life. He is letting you down badly letting his wife wife strave you for her weight issue. They am sorry to say are awful parents and this needs reporting to child services", "Morbidly obese people can still be malnourished by not getting a well rounded diet. \n\nFat/skinny is not a complete picture of health, in fact far from it", "dawg. every comment you\u2019ve made has just been more and more wrong. you\u2019re just showing everybody how little you know about dietary needs. how is he supposed to get a multivitamin if his mom won\u2019t drive him to the store? how is he supposed to eat kraft dinner if he can\u2019t get any? like christ almighty stop", "NTA  \n\n\nSeems like your dad is the target here. Set up a recurring online delivery order, with him paying, that includes what you need to get some calories in. Buy things that are nonperishable and/or get a mini fridge with a lock for your room. Keep your high calorie perishable foods in there like eggs and cheese and meat.   \n\n\nGluten free is not the issue. Boring and low cal is the issue here. Kind of sad a 15 year old needs to set up a meal plan, but here you are.  Get vegetables and keep them in the main fridge since it doesn't seem like she'll fight you for cabbage.   \n\n\nAnd buy spices from Penzeys or something.   \n\n\nWhile your dad is the best resource for you right now, he's choosing to put up with her bs that is damaging your body. I think you need to talk to a school counsellor or maybe some member of your extended family who has the ability to stand up for you to your mom and dad. This is not sustainable. Teenage boys are usually on the hollow leg diet lol  \n\n\nHope you get help because you desperately need it.", "Just eat steaks eggs and burgers. They can all be gluten free", "NTA. As someone who has celiac disease and actually has to follow a gluten free diet I\u2019d just like to point out a couple of things for your mom. \n\nFirstly, gluten free does not equal low calorie. It can be quite the opposite actually depending on the food. I put on weight when I first changed over to a gluten free diet. \n\nSecondly, and I was told this by professionals, following a strictly gluten free diet when you\u2019re not celiac can actually be really unhealthy. That\u2019s because most foods containing gluten (cereals breads etc) have a good amount of fibre. Which you need for a health gut. Most gluten free foods do have added fibre, however they aren\u2019t great and very expensive compared to normal foods. \n\nIf I could choose I would rather not have a gluten free diet, however my health comes first. Why people think they would loose weight going gluten free is beyond me.", "PSA: \"Gluten-free\" is not some \"diet\" for losing weight. Gluten does not make you gain weight. Gluten is a protein that is found in some grains, such as wheat, barley, and rye.\n\nIn fact, many \"Gluten free\" alternatives are actually HIGHER in carbs, sugar, and calories than their \"normal\" counterparts. Many people gain weight going gluten free for this reason!!\n\nIf you are not celiac or have a diagnosed Gluten sensitivity due to autoimmune issues or various other causes- DO NOT GO GLUTEN FREE. You make it harder for the rest of us who are forced to go Gluten free due to medical necessity, not because it is \"trendy\".\n\nRestaurant workers think it is just a trend, so why does cross-contamination really matter? I can just tell the customer something is Gluten free to make then feel better and placate them! It's not REAL, it's just a trend!!\n\nThat ends with a real celiac in the hospital, with severe damage to their intestines.\n\nThe reason some people who go Gluten free lose weight is because they don't eat the \"alternatives\" and are essentially just eating a low-carb diet. Gluten has nothing to do with it, unless you fall into the category of those with a medical reaction to it. And take it from me, you don't want to fall into that category. It's exhausting.", "NTA, sounds like your mom has gone crazy and isn\u2019t thinking straight bc she\u2019s not getting any carbs to power her brain lmao", "NTA", "NTA. I was always so much hungrier than my mom, who made all the food shopping decisions. She isn\u2019t a dieter but is budget conscious (so no snack drawer) and didn\u2019t have the same appetite. I didn\u2019t realize how much it sucked until I grew up and finally had the autonomy to buy the food I need and want.", "NTA and I think the suggestions over here of talking to a third trusted party: school, a kind uncle or aunt, a sports coach would be the next step. Good luck kid!", "NTA does your school have a school nurse or something like that, who could talk to your parents? You need food, you're at the age for a growth spurt soon. A nurse or doctor could maybe talk some sense into them.\n\nAs to whether you were rude, probably not. Criticism, even when it's necessary, doesn't feel good and can feel like it's \"rude\" no matter how you say it.", "NTA, but isn't there a single store in 30 min walk or bike distance you can go to get your own groceries? Sounds like your dad would be willing to give you the money for the groceries - and especially the high carbohydrates foods are usually very cheap (pasta, rice, bread, cereals etc.)", "Hey kid - you could try blue apron or hello fresh and get recipes / ingredients delivered to prepare your own food\u2026do you have access to your own money or do you think you could bring this up to your dad? It\u2019ll help you get a wider variety of foods, teach you to cook and potentially introduce your mom to some better tasting low cal/carb recipes. They usually have diet friendly options you could pick maybe one per week\u2026", "NTA talk to your school about this. If she is under feeding you it is child abuse.", "I would start discussing this state of affairs with your school nurse and guidance counselor. Your mom is absolutely being unreasonable, and she probably isn't going to stop being a pill about it. But you need food. You need food NOW. I know people like to throw around words like abuse and neglect around a lot, but if you are underweight or even close to it then this is absolutely neglect. I'm a mandated reporter and have spent a few years of my nursing career in pediatrics. THIS IS NOT OK. If I knew of a situation like yours irl I would be legally required to report it to the authorities. Being underfed as a child is so damaging to every part of your development, and will, not maybe but will, cause you to have a lot of problems as an adult. Guidance counselor, school, nurse, a teacher, coach, community center personnel, any adult that you feel comfortable discussing this with that will have the tools and resources to help you. Like I said before, she is being unreasonable and is not likely to change that attitude. It'll probably get worse once other adults are holding her to task for this. But you will at that point have resources to help and most importantly you'll be fed. \n\nNta.", "NTA, you should definitely talk to your dad about buying food you are more comfortable with. Make a shopping list with him. If it's possible try to get support from your soccer coach or school nurse and have them talk to your dad about a healthy diet for you.", "Your mom is wrong, you approached it very respectfully, honestly way better than I would deal with this myself. The fact that you have to stand up for this and your dad agrees but does not fix it makes him a coward who is clearly not protecting you.", "Thank you! Celiac here, and I\u2019m screaming at the mom\u2019s cluelessness.", "Yeah I am extremely sympathetic to folks with Celiac (hi mom!) or other more amorphous gluten intolerances - I know folks who have cut out gluten (without a Celiac dx) and report feeling much better. I'm inclined to believe them! And gluten-free food can be freaking delicious (and v v v calorie dense - wait til OPs mom hears about cheese!).\n\n  \n...But I also know folks who use \"gluten free\" to restrict their food intake and mask an eating disorder, so.", "They\u2019re also super healthy if they aren\u2019t fried or made with butter and oil.", "OP, potatoes are gluten free, you should be able to get them even respecting your mom diet.", "Can u ask ur dad to take u grocery shopping? At least for some pasta sauce and spices?", "Your dad is a grown man and not forced to do anything. You are his CHILD he should be prioritising you instead of enabling his wife\u2019s abuse.", "You're welcome. I occasionally have responsibility for a child with coeliac, so I had to learn a fair bit. Still, the good news seems to be that demand from clueless faddists has boosted GF availability. My local supermarket has a whole shelf of GF breads, but ten or fifteen years ago it could only be obtained by prescription from a pharmacist.", "As a non celiac I did need to cut out gluten. It causes me neuropsychological problems.\n\nAnd I'm not saying the mom has gluten issues but a lot of people have other issues like gluten intolerance, IBS, autism related gut problems...", "Ask your dad for groceries money and go buy yourself what you want to eat/prepare it then eat.nta", "There are gluten-free options that are actually much higher calorie and they taste good... \n\nMy suggestion is look for those things and then go shopping with your mom at some point and she'll see that there gluten-free on the face of it and probably not say anything. Canyon bakery makes a pretty darn good Hawaiian sweet loaf bread, for example.", "I agree with the \"you don't have to eat what's made, but that means you have to make your own,\" in most cases. However, in this instance, he is not being provided an adequate diet.  :(", "Agreed. This is some enabler behavior. Complicit in the problem.", "^^ this right here. Potatoes and rice are easy calories. Nuts and nut butters are your friend, OP... Get those fats and (if you're not already) be sure to get enough protein to support growth and healing (post soccer/workouts). \n\nYou are in the prime of puberty- it's important to nutritionally support your body adequately. \n\nEven if you just supplement the dinners you're already eating with PB&J's or a protein shake (some of them taste pretty freaking delicious) in whole milk just for the extra calories, it's better than going without enough caloric intake.", "He's going through puberty. Most boys his age have hollow legs and eat constantly because they're burning so much energy on growth spurts. He's supposed to be growing not a bit underweight for his size.\n\nHonestly I would think it was NBD if she didn't want to cook two meals but was willing to help him get what he needed to cook his own food but her behaviour is weirdly controlling.", "So you like abusing kids like his mom too?", "OP just ignore this person. Posted quite probably a 100 comments here saying the same nonsense. And each comment somehow becomes worse. NTA", "Don't listen to this walking clown fiesta, or any of the other walking clown fiestas that are all \"bUt yOuR'e a nOrMaL wEiGhT fOr 15 hUrR dUrR!!\"\n\nIf you feel that you are going hungry, and if you have noticed that you have not gained much weight in the last few years, YOU DESERVE MORE CALORIES. YOU DESERVE NORMAL FOOD.\n\nBMI don't mean shit. Your current height/weight being \"within parameters\" don't mean shit. You can look up \"normal recommended caloric intake for 15-year-old male\" and the NHS says you need around 2,800kcal/day if you're an active male (which I believe you've said you are, in another comment).\n\nYou can start trying to nail down the exact number of calories you're inputting, roughly, by doing rough calorie counts, and maybe bring your mom a printout of the NHS's guidelines to show her that she is basically starving you. I don't know if she's one to listen to medical guidelines, or if she'll just cover her ears and say \"la la la I'm not listening\" and insisting she's right, but it's worth a try.\n\nOtherwise... if neither of your parents is willing to take you shopping (which it sounds like they aren't) hell, ask your friends if their parents would mind picking you up a few food items next time THEY go shopping (with you giving them the money for it, of course) and your friends could bring it to you at school so you can take it home. Extreme? Sure. But otherwise it sounds like you don't have a lot of options for getting yourself to the store or getting food to yourself. Maybe you'd only have to do it once or twice and it'd snap your parents out of their self-focused trances.\n\nMothers do not get to project their body image problems and weight issues, positive OR negative, onto their kids. I am still struggling with erasing what my mom did to me in that manner when I was your age, and I'm 41.\n\nNTA. Good luck."]}
