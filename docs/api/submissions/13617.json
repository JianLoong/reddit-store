Due to this on multiple occasions arguments have started between me and her over this topic.\n\nMore recently we got into a fight, she was going to make the same bland, low-calorie gluten free \"pasta\" that we must have at least twice a week at this point in time. When I was told she was making this for dinner again I finally decided to talk to her about it. The conversation went something like this:\n\n(Me) \"Hey I really want to talk to you about dinner tonight.\" (Mom) \"Ok? what do we need talk about\" (Me) \"I am not trying to be disrespectful but your dinners are not working for me, I need high calorie foods like bread, etc.\" (Mom) \"Then make them yourself I am not going to make two separate dinners especially for someone who is ungrateful for my cooking\" (Me) \"Ok, can we please go to the store so I can grab some stuff to make it?\" (We barely have anything non-gluten-free or high-cal like potatoes) (Mom) \"I'm not going to take someone to the store who is rude to me.\" (Me) \"Why?? I wasn't trying to be disrespectful to you, I'm sorry if I was.\" (Mom) \"Doesn't matter if you meant to, you were still rude to me; the answer is still no.\"\n\nAfter this I came back \\~30 minutes later (Me) \"Hey, im sorry about earlier can we please go to the store so I can make dinner for myself?\" (Her) \"NO, you don't get to come out here and pretend like you were not rude to me and then ask me to drive you somewhere\" After this, I knew it was going nowhere so I went into the kitchen and made myself a simple bowl with like half a packet of tofu and some onions.\n\nI feel like im not an asshole but I cant shake the feeling that I might be, so Reddit, AITA???", "created_utc": 1680224952, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1275ecu/aita_for_being_rude_to_my_mom_because_she_forces/", "score": 620, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If so, you are still in a normal range for weight. So I wouldn\u2019t get too worried about that. If not, that\u2019s pretty concerning that your mother would be so selfish. I have noticed throughout my life that many of those who have struggled with weight most of their lives who get thin after 40 become absolutely obsessed not only with themselves but with their family and friends.

I have one too.  They eat a lot, because they are growing.  \n\nIt should not be such a struggle for him to get food that he would enjoy eating -- not straight up junk food, but some actual food that he likes.    \n\nHis dad gets a break from it because he has a license and can pick up something different for lunch or whatever.   The kid is stuck with his mom's choices at home or school lunch which is also not always great.", "You're also a woman and not a teenage boy", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with not being able to gain and no one is weight shaming \n\nThe difference here is at 34 your done growing while op is at the stage of life when puberty hits a growing really ramps up so they need the extra calories to be able to safely grow\n\nNot to mention the fact that just like teen girls, teen boys are not immune to eating disorders so being shamed for wanting to eat higher calorie foods is dangerous", "Same for me really. 5\u20195\u201d around 115 pounds (not sure exact weight), 25. Doctor has a mild concern of my weight, but mainly due to issues of randomly getting lightheaded. Other than that there is nothing\u2026", "Eating a strict gluten free diet when you don't have Celiac's disease or a severe gluten intolerance is unhealthy and can lead to vitamin and nutrient deficiencies. Gluten free substitute foods in general also tend to have more fat, sugar and salt than their gluten-containing counterparts. \n\nI'm so sorry you're having to go through this. If you think your mom would be open to it, maybe ask about going to see a registered dietitian. They'd be able to guide both you and your mom and help make sure you both are getting proper nutrition.", "OP, show this comment to your Dad! He has an obligation as your father to make sure you're getting the nutrition you need right now for long term brain health, ffs! It's not just about you being skinny, it's about him sacrificing your health for your mother's.", "These would all fall under the umbrella of medical conditions that make you sick if you eat gluten", "She can buy she's an asshole.", "It sounds like the mom probably wouldn\u2019t allow that because she also needs low calorie for herself for weight loss/maintenance and doesn\u2019t want the temptation of keeping higher calorie foods in the house. If it were just an issue of the mom having celiac and not wanting cross contamination (but with no other dietary restrictions) OP probably wouldn\u2019t have this problem.\n\nI think OP might need to have a doctor back him up on the kid needing more high calorie foods. The mom might just be happy the kid is not obese and thus avoiding those issues, and not realize that he is on his way to a whole other set of health problems from being undernourished.", "They are willing to make their own but their mom isn't buying other food for them to make themselves.", "Please stop being an ass to a teenager \n\nEat at school- he may not be able to\nForce yourself- great way to get an eating disorder \nCook at home- has already said the food there is not high enough calories", "You\u2019re right, but idk if the mom is in a place to hear this.", "Are you always this dense of an AH? OP is an athlete being forced to eat a calorie deficient meal every single night. It's already effected his ability to play his sport for the majority of a season from a knee injury due to improper nutrition (weakened patella). In the western world we tend to want kids to have enough nutrition to reach their full potential size wise as adults. You are all over the place on this post projecting some past trauma around food, or just trolling. It's hard to tell at this point with all the comments you're leaving trashing OP for wanting proper nutrition.", "Yep, I said that because a lot of people dismiss non celiacs. Even Conan made fun of gluten free and he's my favorite talk show host. \ud83d\ude15", "You are probably right and that is horrifying. Yes OP should inform the Dr at the next opportunity of what his mom is doing.", "Malnourished does not automatically equal underweight. It means that someone is consuming too much or too little food or essential nutrients. The fact that he is hardly eating but has very little appetite is a symptom of malnutrition. A good doctor will listen to him and order blood work to check for malnutrition, as well as refer him to a registered dietitian regardless of the lab results. A good doctor will also tell his mother that it's unhealthy to go on a gluten free diet without a legitimate cause (i.e. Celiac's disease or gluten intolerance), and can result in vitamin and nutrient deficiencies. It sounds like his mom could benefit from seeing a registered dietitian as well.", "Rather she's in the place to hear it or not, she's failing her child.", "You should be worried about that. Your mother is literally neglecting you, and your father is enabling it. Like seriously, they could be found guilty of child abuse and negligence. If they won't listen to you, try talking to your school counselor.", "He\u2019s not being forced to eat a calorie deficient diet. He doesn\u2019t like the food mom cooks.\n\nHe can cook his own food - which he did in the post"]}
