I will bet her son knows she did this.", "Hi OP. Please please don't talk to your wife about oeaving her until you talk to a lawyer first. If she ever lays a hand on you again, you call the cops.\n\nYou also should talk to someone that helps people get away and move on from DV.\n\nDV can absolutely escalate to death because the abuser doesn't like them getting away.\n\nYour safety is so important, and document everything. Have a plan!!", "I actually thought his referring to things as \"our farm\" was kind of sweet, family-like. He was realling into the whole thing, and you likely hurt his feelings when you lashed out so he did too.", "OP, I feel so badly for you and I hope you come through this. \n\nSuggestions:\nFind all paperwork that you can lay your hands on.\n\nLoad your truck with any tools or items that are yours.\n\nLeave (would any kids give you temporary home?)\n\nSee a lawyer, make a list of things she has done \n\nKeep up with your therapist \n\nFinish divorce \n\nEspecially important- live happily ever.after", "NTA But your wife should have stepped in a lot sooner and shut down his behavior. She still needs to.", "NTA OP but I think you need to get free of your current wife. She is clearly abusive and her son is following her lead. Be careful around them both. There's no doubt her son believes you'll be out of the picture soon and is making plans. You need to GTFO of there. Please ensure you know how the financials all sit and that you cannot be left without access to funds. Take care of yourself. Forget couples counselling she is an abuser but go to counselling or therapy on your own.", "YTA. \n\nThe reaction to the tools I understand. \n\nThe reaction to your stepson\u2019s take on his actual home is fucked. \u201cOurs\u201d is the proper term for familial property like \u201cour farm\u201d and \u201cour pond\u201d. What is wrong with you that you get rubbed the wrong way over a teenager saying he\u2019d like some ducks on the family farm? \n\nYou seem wound real tight."]}
