My children are in their upper twenties  and hers are well into their thirties. None of them have ever lived with us and they are all living on their own.\n\nAfter getting married my wife and I purchased a farm that we currently live on. The problem is that my stepson has laid claim to everything we own by calling it \"Ours\". We were sitting at the table and we was looking at a magazine and saw something he liked in it. He looked at me and said \"We need this on our farm\". He has referred to everything this way. Our farm, our cows, our tractor, our truck, our pond, our work shop. You get the idea. One day he told me he needed the truck to haul something. He was referring to my pick up. In my mind I was thinking couldn't you ask me to borrow my truck like most people would instead of telling me your taking it. \n\nThe final straw was when he went into my workshop and rearranged stuff and made adjustments to some equipment I have without me knowing about it. I sent him a text and blew up at him telling him that he was entitled and had no respect for the stuff that his mom work hard to have. I told him that because his mom and I own something it doesn't mean that he also owns it. I also told him to never make changes to my equipment without talking to me about it first. He told me to fuck off and that he never really liked me anyway. He was just nice to me because of his mom. \n\nI could understand if he was ten years old and lived with us.

You were rightfully upset and had to set the boundaries straight since this is habitual. My biggest concern is your wife since her son was raised believing this is acceptable behavior.

I also never expect the same from my mothers boyfriend. We have a bond but thats between us and not out partners.

They pretty much did what they wanted when they wanted without caring for anyone else. For instance my wife and I were riding with my stepson in his truck and he pulled through McDonald's and ordered himself something and never turned to ask us if we wanted anything.

However I may have been a little harsh on myself when I said that I blew up. When he messed with my equipment that was time for me to speak up.

I told him that I would never come to his house and make changes to his stuff and it's wrong for him to do that to me.

I think you need to talk to your wife about this incident as an example.

Tell her so that you don't blindside her. And please, follow through.", "I never said it was the step parent's responsibility to re-parent an adult. I said it wasn't automatically easy.

Probably not and I bet he wouldn't like it if you did.. dude needs to grow up.", "NTA. But it seems like your wife allows this behavior.

No mystery why the stepson is how he is. Put locks on everything and cut him off from all access.", "If you look at OPs comment history, it's clear that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Wife treats OP horribly.", "NTA - I wouldn't really call that blowing up at him. \n\nI do think you need to talk to your wife about how you have been feeling and that you should have done that long ago. You two need to decide together how to handle conflicts with your adult children. Letting her think things are fine when you have been getting progressively more annoyed for the last 5 years is not really fair or healthy."]}
