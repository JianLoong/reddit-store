Your body \u2014 your choice. You tell people whatever you want. \n\nSecond \u2014 it\u2019s very very very common not to go around telling randos that your pregnant until at least 12 weeks because of different complicating factors. \n\nThird \u2014 a fetus at 8 weeks is like the size of your thumbnail. No one knows it\u2019s happening inside your body unless you tell them. So if people assumed you were pregnant because of how your body looked when you were 8 weeks pregnant; that\u2019s exactly what you thought it was and you had every right to shut it down.", "INFO: I mean, did you lie? Or is this your pizza baby, as in, baby named Pizza? How far can you push the narrative that this baby WILL be named Pizza or a pizza related name?", "NTA  \n\n\nIt is entirely up to you when is the right time for you to tell others about your pregnancy!\r  \n\r  \nAs you wrote: This question should not be asked at all. Because what do you achieve? Either the person isn't pregnant and it's super embarrassing. Or the person is pregnant and they are being deprived of the opportunity to tell it first or are being forced to lie.\r  \nMaybe your friend will learn from this.", "Nta, realistically you were 2 weeks pregnant at that point since the first 2 weeks of pregnancy are before you even ovulate so there is no actual pregnancy at that point. It would be entirely reasonable for you to have not even known you were pregnant 3 months ago when you're only 4 months along now. It's absurd your friend is making a fuss about your medical information and when you choose to share it, but also something that happened months ago when its perfectly plausibpenyou didn't even lie to her and just hadn't tested yet.", "You know sometimes I think I might be more fucking nuts than I thought. Because from my pov asking someone whether they are pregnant or not is a normal thing, but here you see everyone on Reddit shitting the bed over it. Although I personally don't ask the question I've never batted an eye at people asking the question, because its a normal thing in my eyes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand if you ask this question and a person hasn't grown in size yet because of the baby and they just tell you its a pizza baby you just have to take the L and move on, getting butthurt over something like this is stupid. So no you're not the AH for saying you weren't pregnant, but I don't think the other person was an AH for asking the question either. \n\nOn the other hand kicking up a fuss 3 months later is petty just let it be.", "NTA. And at that point it *was a pizza baby*. You wouldn't have started showing yet. If you didn't find out until days earlier, it seems plausible that you would have found out \\*after\\* she talked to you.\n\nI can't imagine not only making such a giant social faux pas but having the gall to bring it up months later and blame the victim.", "NTA, it\u2019s none of their business until you decide to share. Ask your friends who are taking their side if they would feel comfortable sharing about a pregnancy that early on, or being asked if they\u2019re pregnant well before they \u201cshowed\u201d.", "Congrats, first of all. NTA second of all.", "NTA. You don't owe people information about your pregnancy that early in the pregnancy. It seems like only a coincidence that you knew at that time, as opposed to a day or two later. Plus, at 1 month, whatever they were commenting on probably *was* a pizza baby", "NTA Theres no way you would've been showing that early on, so your friend was still being the rude on here. Explain that to them - just because they happened to be right this time, doesn't mean that every woman with a belly has a baby in there.", "NTA.  You wouldn't have been showing by then.  Your friend was WRONG to make that assumption.  It doesn't matter that you were technically pregnant; you were not visibly pregnant.\n\nI was asked when I was due one time.  I just smiled and said I'm not pregnant, I'm just fat.  The guy who asked couldn't get out of the room fast enough.  I hope he never asked another woman again.", "NTA. You never ask someone if they are pregnant. If they were pregnant and ready to share, they would. \n\nTrue story: My grandma (mother's mother) started asking my mom if she was pregnant everytime she saw her. My mom had recently re-married and my stepfather LOOOOOVED sweets, so the cookie jar was never empty and they had ice cream every night as a bedtime snack - so of course my mom put on a little weight. But grandma asked EVERY SINGLE TIME she saw her. Did I mention my mom was postmenopausal at this point and Grandma knew it? We had always called her evil Grandma and to the end she proved she deserved the moniker.", "NTA. My gf and me didn't k ow she was pregnant until 4-5 months In, of you just found out some days before hand tell her\n\"Yes I was pregnant, but I didn't find outmyself until a week or so latter, so I responded in the same way I always have when not pregnant.\"", "NTA.\n\nShe asked a question she never should have asked, in a way that embarrassed YOU.  So IMO she deserved it.\n\nPlus, it was only a few days, so you should be able to say you weren't certain at the time.", "NTA, you have boundaries and not everything needs to be shared immediately. Your friend should understand that.", "NTA", "NTA because your health is nobody's damn business.\n\nBut part of the issue seems to be that you keep letting them get away with inappropriate and invasive questions in the first place. You seem to have fallen into a routine of deflecting with humor because you are hurt, but then they aren't being called out on the fact that they are overstepping the line.\n\nSeems like it's past time for you to gently let them know that you understand their intentions may be good, but you would appreciate your privacy being respected.   If and when you have an announcement to make about your health, you will make it.\n\nAnd then if they continue to disrespect you, it's time to tell them not-so-gently.", "NTA.\n1. People have no business going round asking people of they're pregnant. Someone could look pregnant but for all they know it could be something else.\n\n2. It puts the person in such a vulnerable position! For instance I've sensed and have been right on each occasion that my colleagues were pregnant but never asked them till they told me!", "Lying is not good either way.", "NTA. You don\u2019t ask someone if they\u2019re pregnant and you don\u2019t have to announce your pregnancy until you\u2019re ready. If your friends don\u2019t understand these two basic things, you need to find new friends.", "NTA, if you only found out days before you wouldn't have been showing so she made the same assumption based on appearance regardless.\n\nNot to mention, you tell people at your own pace. She's not entitled to know earlier than others because she judged how you look.\n\nI have PCOS and know that certain body shapes look pregnant and not just overweight. It's awful and she deserved to learn a lesson.", "NTA. Nobody should be asking a woman if she\u2019s pregnant unless they are her physician. You aren\u2019t obligated to disclose a pregnancy until you\u2019re damn well ready to do so.", "NTA.\n\nYour friend isn\u2019t your spouse or baby daddy; they have no reasonable expectation to know about your health and medical condition.\n\nYou weren\u2019t ready to share that yet and she put you in an awkward spot.", "NTA you shouldn\u2019t have had any significant weight change at the time, so she should still be embarrassed. If you were six months or something and told her that, then maybe, but in this case it was early enough that she was still just being insulting.", "NTA\n\nPeople should mind their own business. Stop asking for personal questions. If you want people to know you would tell them.", "NTA. You should never ask a woman if she's pregnant unless you can see the baby coming out.", "It\u2019s never anyone\u2019s business to to pay the what\u2019s in your tummy game. \n\nYou\u2019re entitled to any answer that makes you comfortable. The fact that she\u2019s annoyed is hilariously ironic. You are the one who should have that right.\n\nSo temping you start announcing the what\u2019s in my body game for her when you see her to give her a taste of why it\u2019s none of her business.\n\n\u201cMy colon is full.

Too fired up to vote the first time.", "NTA you weren\u2019t comfortable sharing your pregnancy at that moment.  It\u2019s your business not hers.  If she didn\u2019t want to be embarrassed she shouldn\u2019t have asked a rude question she had no right asking.", "NTA, she shouldn't have embarrassed you and put you on the spot back then.  She had no right to knowing if you were pregnant until you were ready to say so.", "NTA. There is a possibility you didn\u2019t know at the time. And that early it\u2019s none of their business, they still shouldn\u2019t ask.", "NTA- they aren't entitled to any information about your pregnancy status, whether its really pregnancy or just pizza. \n\nAlso, your friend is making a LOT of assumptions with the \"putting 2 and 2 together\".
