A friend waited until she was 5 months as she wasn't showing and a high risk pregnancy.", "I've seen a lot of posts on here where OP or the couple have waited until they're at least 12 weeks due to the risk of miscarry in those weeks, and in some cases they're high risk, or even waited until they're 3rd trimester (mostly) because of history of risk.\n\nI've also seen an article or two where the woman thought she was having stomach cramps, went to toilet and ended up having a baby.", ">\" Are you sure?\"\n\nJebus this killed me!

I believe that anyone who\u2019s been asked if they\u2019re pregnant while not being pregnant remembers it! \n\nWhen I had my period a couple of months ago, my mom came over with some painkillers. When she opened the door and saw me she practically yelled \u201comg are you pregnant look at your belly!\u201d and I was like \u201cthanks mom, didn\u2019t you come over here to give me painkillers since I have my period 1 + 1 = 2\u2026 I will never forget it \ud83d\ude05", "NTA. At that stage it was a pizza baby. You very likely were not showing any physical signs of pregnancy at that stage, certainly not enough to get stopped on the street. So technically speaking, they did make a comment about your weight. Though why anyone feels the need to comment on any of it is beyond me. Its entirely up to you whether you chose to share something as personal as a pregnancy anyway and its no ones business if you are or are not pregnant. You do you girl. Congrats on your bundle of love", "NTA.  When this person (I would truly hesitate to call this person a 'friend') asked, you weren't pregnancy showing at all, so your standard response was right on.  I would tell this person and any of her cronies \"I didn't know I was pregnant when she asked so she was just calling me fat.\"", "NTA. People should not be commenting on your body or be trying to gazump your news.

You were not pregnant enough to be shopping and therefore your belly was indeed a \"pizza belly\". Your friend is rude and entitled.", "Nta. For all she knows you hadn\u2019t found out yet anyway, and wouldn\u2019t have even been showing yet so very early for it to be a factor in your appearance when she asked her rude question. And even then, how is your body her business? You could have been 6 months along and still not obligated to tell her jack diddly spit. Ask her if she\u2019s pregnant next time you see her. Let\u2019s see what happens.", "NTA - Why do people still think this is an ok question to ask?! You should never, ever ask a person if they're pregnant.", "NTA. I dont mention pregnancy unless the person talks about it first. I dont care if she looks 10 months pregnant. Its just not my business. And at 8 weeks the baby isnt showing. She did in fact call you fat. She should be embarrassed. Throw that back in her face if she brings it up again.", "I feel this pain daily. I had my son 3 years ago and sadly I never lost the weight and my stomach looks like I'm still 7 months pregnant but due to health reasons I can't work out or anything. I'm so tired of being asked when I'm due", "LOL - when I was pregnant with my 2nd son, the director at my older son's daycare seemed be ignoring my 2nd pregnancy. By the time I go t to 20 weeks or so, it was VERY obvious I was pregnant, but she didn't say a word (no congratulations, no questions, nothing), so I didn't either.\n\nFinally when I was about 28 weeks along, I asked her about getting my baby to be on the wait list for the infant room. She looked SO relieved, hugged me and said she was so happy that our family was welcoming another baby. I kind of looked at her a bit strangely at the sudden outpouring of emotion and she said she made a rule NEVER to mention a pregnancy (or a suspected pregnancy) unless the mother to be mentioned it first. I guess this director had had some faux pas in the past with mothers who weren't actually pregnant when she mentioned something (oops) and wanted to avoid that going forward.", "Years back, I worked at a department store. I was 16 years old and, while not stick-thin, I wasn't fat either. I probably wore a size 12 at the time and I VERY much looked like a 16 year old.\n\nA couple came in and needed some help picking out baby clothing for a gift. So, I helped them pick out some stuff, rung them up and directed them to our gift wrap area. As they were leaving, the wife looked at me and said \"When is your baby due?\" I looked at her in horror and said, \"Ummm, I'm 16 and definitely not pregnant.\" She turned a deep shade of crimson and just about ran off to that gift wrap department. It was so weird. I literally have NO idea why she thought I was expecting - maybe because I knew a lot about baby clothes? Hello, I WORKED THERE, of course I'd know about baby clothes.\n\nIt sticks with me all these years later not because it hurt my feelings, but because it was just so weird and out of left field! My co-workers had hearty laugh when I told them what happened!", "Its still pretty standard - last pregnancy I told some people early, including parents, and friends and work around 10 weeks.  We lost her at 14, but it was good to have the support of them all. I was glad we hadn\u2019t done a Facebook announcement though.  This time round we waited until past 14 weeks to share (didn\u2019t want to put my family through it again\u2026).  I know others who shared at 6 weeks.  I think it just depends on the person and their circumstances (6 weeks was a very ill coworker).\n\nThere were a few things I said or did this time around that had my sister quite suspicious that I was pregnant, but every time she wanted to ask or say something she told herself \u201cdon\u2019t ask, she will tell me when she\u2019s ready.\u201d  Which is what everyone should do, really.  I always have the comeback of \u201cI had sex last night so fingers crossed\u201d ready if anyone ever asked me about pregnancy when I thought it was inappropriate.", "Lol I didn\u2019t tell my closest friends till they came to my apartment and physically saw the new baby. They were shocked pikachu faced like who does this baby belong to? He\u2019s mine had him last week. You decide what medical info you give out and when. You don\u2019t owe anyone that info. It is so rude to ask if someone is pregnant or not. Some cultures don\u2019t do baby showers or gifts till after baby arrives as it is considered bad luck. Each their own!", "After multiple losses, I assure you many women still wait to tell the news. The only reason I will tell others earlier is if it's a need to know. I currently am a sahm, but when I was working with my last pregnancy I had terrible morning sickness. My boss needed to know and so did my assistant. \n\nMany women wait, and I have known plenty who won't  announce until babe is actually born.", "When we showed up at church with our new baby a couple weeks after our oldest was born, we overheard someone comment \"I didn't know (wife and I) were adopting.\" \n\nMy wife was on the larger side and didn't show as mush as she did on the other pregnancies, but still did look pregnant.", "Yeah, there are other symptoms of pregnancy other than a growing belly, but since OP answered the way they answered, I assume no such clue was noticed by the friend.", "NTA. But I definitely think there was a better way to have handled it. If this is your friend you could have told them that the question makes you uncomfortable, plus that you were but you were not telling people yet. You are still nta because you would not have been showing yet bellywise. But also maybe it was a misunderstanding and she thought you had that pregnancy glow thing people talk about.", "NTA None of the weight you were showing was baby weight. Your friend should keep her yap shut about your appearance.", "NTA. I once heard that the only time you ask someone if they\u2019re pregnant is if you see a head crowning. Otherwise, you wait until it\u2019s been stated that it\u2019s definitely a pregnancy before you congratulate. And you decide when you\u2019re comfortable announcing a pregnancy, no one else.  I had to tell people I lost a baby because my Dad blabbed before we wanted to tell people other than our parents and I miscarried at around 11 weeks. It\u2019s was sad and shocking when someone would congratulate me or touch my belly (ugh, get bent with that bullshit) and I\u2019d have to shut it down.", "She asked you an potentially hurtful (and nosey) question and has the audacity to accuse you of embarrassing *HER*?   \nMaybe you didn't find out until after her gaucherie.  \nIt's really none of her business and it's still a rude question for her to have asked.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You have no obligation to tell people you're pregnant on their timeline. They should be embarassed about their need to comment on people's bodies.  Don't need to take their cues from others. Outside of you mentioning being pregnant, the only time someone should ask is if there is a head sticking out of your crotch.", "Nta.  You never ask if someone is pregnant. Ever. Even if it's ridiculously obvious.  \n\nI saw an interview with Barbara Eden who played Jeannie on I Dream of Jeannie.  She was 8 months along and the baby died in the womb. She had to carry it for another 6 weeks and the hardest part was people making comments about the baby while she knew it was already gone.  The fans and friends were just trying to be nice and happy for her. After hearing that I have never made a comment without the other person initiating it. I just couldn't imagine that pain and wouldn't want to inflict it on someone else. \n\n Also, it's very typical to wait until the end of the 1st trimester to announce it to family and friends. And since you had only found out a couple of days prior, it's conceivable that you would not have had it confirmed yet so you might not have even been lying. She's just assuming, correctly but still.", "NTA, I had a coworker make this mistake at work and she was rightfully embarrassed. She then asked me if she looked pregnant and I told her honestly, no she didn't look pregnant. Even if she did we have no right to that information and we shouldn't ask. If they want to talk about their pregnancy, they will. I know she was hoping I would alleviate her embarrassment and while I didn't want to embarrass her further she needed to know her actions were inappropriate.", "NTA. You get to say when you are comfortable telling people about your pregnancy. What is it with people who go round asking other people if they are pregnant, anyway? That seems incredibly intrusive and nosy to me. (plus, when I was a teenager I asked someone that question and she wasn't, and I never, ever asked it again!)", "NTA. Sufferer of pregnant tummy, even when I was a really small size elsewhere. It\u2019s rude, it\u2019s disarming, it\u2019s invasive.

I guess next time I'll just say I'm bloated or I got my period, to shut people up.\n\nAnyway, as people have already commented, no one should ever ask a woman if she's pregnant or not. Even if it's obvious. If she wants to share, she'll do it on her own.", "It was none of her business. How about that?!\n\nNTA.", "All of this. \n\nI am not over weight but I have rounded out slightly as I\u2019ve got older (damn you, slowing metabolism) and my husband and I have been trying to get pregnant for years now. I have seen some people speculate when they thought I couldn\u2019t hear and it has crushed me. I have had a number of chemical pregnancies but never had a pregnancy long enough to even think about telling anyone. People speculating because my weight has fluctuated or I\u2019m a bit heavier than the last time they saw me is awful. I don\u2019t need a reminder that I could lose a few pounds or a reminder that I haven\u2019t been able to have a baby after 3.5 years of trying. \n\nIt really doesn\u2019t matter the circumstances, don\u2019t ask (or speculate where someone can overhear) about someone being pregnant. If they want you to know, they will tell you. \n\nPlus, OPs friend putting two and two together to figure out she lied, after only having know she was pregnant for a few days!?! It\u2019s perfectly possible that she found out after that conversation. We aren\u2019t talking many months pregnant at that time, it would have been weeks (another reason she should have never asked). She is embarrassed because she should be. She should never have asked.", "I cannot imagine this is the only weird bullshit said \"friend\" has pulled.", "You absolutely were not showing when she asked you that. She was calling you fat. You were not pregnant enough for that to have been referring to this pregnancy. She should have also known better than to say that to you. I don't compliment my friend's biceps because it bothers her anorexia but your \"friend\" asked you if you were pregnant??? These are not your friends nor are they people you can count on.", "Yeah, like maybe if it's your best friend a gentle \"maybe you should take a test\" might be okay but it's still kind of condescending, like oh I didn't think of that.\n\nI had a ton of nausea for a long time and I got really tired of even the most well meaning coworkers asking if I'd taken a test.
