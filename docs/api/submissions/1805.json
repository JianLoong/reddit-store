A day being pregnant or a week wouldn\u2019t have shown so she was commenting on your weight which is uncalled for.  And as other mentioned and I\u2019ve even said to people you don\u2019t ask women if they are pregnant.  Hell even if I came across someone actively giving birth I wouldn\u2019t ask.", "NTA. Stop asking people if they are pregnant and just let them tell you.", "NTA.  She doesn't KNOW you knew you were pregnant back when she asked.", "NTA. \nI had a woman ask me once when I was due and I told I wasn\u2019t pregnant just fat. \n\nShe basically called me a liar and said she could see I was pregnant.\n\nWhy would I lie about being fat for gods sake?!", "NTA. You may have been pregnant medically, but you weren't showing. She was asking about a pizza baby, and doesn't get off by technicality. She was being just as rude as anyone else who's ever asked you that question.", "As someone who is heavy, I am so sorry. Where do these rude ass people come from? If they were really your \"friend\" they wouldn't ask a question like that or get mad after the fact. It's none of their business regardless. \n\nNTA", "NTA, your too early to be showing so what they see is really still just a pizza baby, you didn't lie about that part", "A friend who I hadn't seen for a while asked me by text if I  had any news to share. I knew what she meant; I am in perimenopause and was thin-ish before but now I am shaped like an apple. I am extremely self-conscious about my sudden weight gain and I know everyone else sees it too but now I KNOW for sure everyone else sees it. I hope she was embarrassed but that doesn't make me feel better.", "I really can't imagine asking a woman if she's pregnant.\n\nIf she is... and wants me to know... she'll tell me.  Don't ask\n\nIf she is... and doesn't want to tell me... it's none of my business. Don't ask.If she isn't... I'm putting my foot in my mouth up to the ankle.  Don't ask.\n\nIn other words... don't ask.  NTA.  \n\n\nShe deserved to get embarassed.", "Its the kind of thing you announce when you are ready. So, no matter that your friend feels she was entitled to ask you, you were still entitled to announce when you chose.\n\nNTA.", "Absolutely NTA. All these people demanding personal info from you should be ashamed. People don't share their pregnancies until they're ready for good reason. And she 100% could not see your brand new baby in your belly yet. She still deserved the embarrassment and should learn to stop asking the question. And you should tell her as much.", "NTA. Absolutely not. I was also asked about this when I was a few weeks pregnant and not ready to tell anyone. I don\u2019t even get why people would ask as they\u2019ll find out when we\u2019re ready to share! I replied with \u2018it\u2019ll happen when it happens\u2019 but he did mention it after we went public too. I did point out my reply was true, even if I was aware that it was quite likely to be within the next nine months at the time!", "You are allowed to refrain from answering rude and intrusive questions. And who is your friend to say you knew at the time? They\u2019re oddly upset about your personal news. \n\nNTA", "I'm so surprised that people actually persist in doing this. No, NTA", "NTA\n\nYour answer probably was correct - a pregnancy that early doesn\u2019t show.\n\nAlso I hate the idea you\u2019re supposed to give up private, personal information just because someone asked. \n\nMaybe she should be embarrassed about asking an invasive, hurtful question. And if she\u2019s your friend, why doesn\u2019f she understand the concept of not being ready to talk about some things?", "NTA but a better response would be, \"Are you stupid or just ignorant? That is the only reason I can think of that anyone would ask that. So, which is it? Stupid or ignorant?\"", "And considering OP was about 1 month along at the time, there's plausible deniability there; most people don't know they're pregnant that early. They may not even have missed a period yet, or could just think they're a little late. So OP *could* have said that she was pregnant then, but hadn't known it yet.", "Yep. I have a chronic disease that makes me look pregnant, and I *hate* the awkward conversations when someone asks if I'm pregnant and I have to tell them I'm not. I truly can't explain how horrible it is to have those conversations - I average about one a month. Please, everyone, just stop asking women if they're pregnant.", "I did something the other way around.  I knew a co-worker was pregnant.  I then didn't see her for quite some time, and when I did, I asked how the pregnancy was going.  She had miscarried.\n\nI felt awful and vowed never to say such a thing again.  Now I wait until THEY mention the pregnancy.", "I\u2019m at 7 months and I still haven\u2019t posted anything on social media. The people in my life who need to know, know.", "Miscarriage is most common in the 1st trimester- most women don't tell people so that they don't have do go back and do a super public 'I miscarried' statement.  Nothing about that has changed at all.  Yes - it is more common to talk about Miscarriage as a thing, that doesn't mean most women want to do it right after having one.  \n\nIf anything has changed it is the idea that pregnant women's bodies are NOT public property and anyone who is expecting can do things however the fuck they want to do things and other people can be supportive by keeping their hands and thoughts to themselves.  We are expected to be more understanding about pregnant ladies - not less.  It even became a thing during covid to not tell anyone at all until the baby arrived.  (Excpet gender reveal, we are all becoming less understanding about big ass gender reveal stuff).", "I told people right away because I felt like I would jinx myself otherwise. Others feel the exact opposite and that\u2019s okay. Entirely your choice.", "A lot of my friends waited 3 months to tell anyone, and I told my close friends early on but didn\u2019t announce it publicly till 3 months. And I\u2019m currently 5 months pregnant, so this is very recent!! You\u2019re not old fashioned-a lot of people don\u2019t want to deal with everyone knowing if they have a miscarriage, or they\u2019re like me and superstitious.", "To be fair, if you know she's crowning and you're wondering if she's pregnant, she might start wondering if you understand how to drink water or breathe air correctly", "Even then it's best to just keep your mouth shut about it", "I'd love the ability to keep it secret that long. I absolutely would still tell people because I can't keep a secret to save my life, but with my third pregnancy my mom was watching my older 2 while I worked and I started puking at like 5 weeks so something was obviously up", "I'm so sorry that you're going through that. It's not an easy discussion at all.\n\nI also am disabled and had to have this discussion with my husband and I was so hellbent on pushing to have children naturally as we had decided natural/adoption only. I am now about due and after a terrible pregnancy that has put a strain on everything in my life, I regret the pregnancy but not the baby that is to come. \n\nI hope that both your and your husvands life is full of as much joy as possible and that you get to depend as much quality time together as possible", "You earned yourself a (free) award for this comment.", "But ask quickly, because she won't be for much longer....", "She remembers. I remember all 3 times someone\u2019s asked me that in perfect detail. The most recent one, I just said \u201cNo.\u201d and she said \u201coh we were wondering because of your weight\u201d. Like, no shit. I cried for hours. I saw her after I lost the weight (and then some) and she asked how I got so thin. I told her that when she asked me if I was pregnant I was so embarrassed that I changed everything about my diet and exercise routine.", "Thank you. I'm sorry you've had a rough pregnancy, but I hope you have a wonderful parenthood and that your little one is a blessing!", "Oh, I feel this, I have the same issue with posture and weight distribution and get this question all the time. \n\nI also find women are far more likely to ask if I'm pregnant than men.", "I will never forget being congratulated on my \u201cpregnancy\u201d by a random server in a restaurant. I didn\u2019t know what to say and I was embarrassed so I just went along with it and said thanks. Ugh it haunts me when I can\u2019t sleep  so my anxiety brain reflects on all the horrible embarrassing moments of my life", "What does \"even if the timing is off\" mean here?\n\nAlso, that isn't your period being \"linked,\" that just means you have similarly lengthed periods.", "For instance, my daughter started her period recently, so she's not always regular and could go 21 days between periods or 35 days. She is usually 21 days between periods, but sometimes she off (normal for her age). We all start our periods with 24 hrs of each other no matter what. So my daughter has thrown both my cycle and my bff's cycle off. Before my daughter hit puberty, I was probably the most regular person ever getting every 21 days unless my bff messed up her birth control, which messed up her cycle. Because my bff is on BC, her periods only last 4-5 days. My daughter and my periods last 7 days. \n\nLast month my bff called me and asked if my daughter got her period (a week early) and she did. My bff got hers a week early too. I got mine the next day, 6 days early.\n\nI know this is not normal. We make jokes about it. Even my husband makes jokes about it. Honestly it's kinda creepy.", "You\u2019ve just how your periods aren\u2019t synced, though. Your bff has a different length period and you and your daughters periods don\u2019t start on the same day. \n\nIt seems like you are searching for patterns"]}
