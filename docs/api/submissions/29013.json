We don't get out often because I am constantly busy and/or hanging out with my boyfriend (23M). While on the way to the restaurant, my mother asked if it would just be us or would my boyfriend's family be joining us. \n\nFor context, my boyfriend and I take out our parents about once a month so that our families stay connected. My boyfriend and I have been together for awhile and it's no secret that we are talking about engagement. I have a single mom, and he has a single father (important for later).\n\n I explained to my mother that it would just be us tonight. She said \"Good. I really like (BF's Father), but after you said he has a girlfriend, I didn't want to see him anymore.\" \n\nI was confused at this and asked  \"Why does him having a girlfriend matter?\" In hindsight, I wish I never asked. She replied \"I've always liked (BF's father).\" \nMe: \"haha as a friend right?\"\n\n At this my mother went on an entire rant about how she was allowed to like him and how it would be okay. I vehemently disagreed, even going so far as to say \"No mom, it's not okay that you like him. He's likely going to be my father in law one day! That's not okay.\"\n And her response was \"Well he can be your father in law / father.\" \n\nI felt sick to my stomach after that. For a while I just sat there, listening to her justify a relationship with the father of my future fianc\u00e9. She made the comparison to marrying your cousin, and even said that it \"wouldn't matter because we weren't related. We would just be step siblings.\" \n\nAt some point I snapped \"I hope you realize that if you ever try to get with him, I will disown you as a mother.\" She stopped talking to me after that.\n\n This is where I think I may be the asshole. I'm not here to discuss the morality of my mother dating my boyfriend's father. But was I wrong for saying I would disown her if she did? My boyfriend said I'm not the asshole, and that he would disown his father for the same thing.

Plus imagine the mess if they dated and it ended badly!", "Wtf is up with these comments?? You're NTA", "I think your reaction was justified. There are plenty of fish in the sea, no need to make your daughters marriage totally weird.", "NTA.\n\nI would have had the exact same reaction.\n\nThat would be a fucked up situation and I wouldn't blame you for disowning your mum.", "You are NTA. \n\nYour mom is allowed to have a relationship with whomever she wants but that doesn\u2019t mean there might not be consequences for her doing so. You told her in no uncertain terms that there would, in fact, be consequences. You have that right as well. \n\nIf both of your relationships progressed to marriage that would literally make your husband also your step-brother. Umm\u2026that\u2019s a no!\n\nIf their relationship ended it likely would make those enjoyable get togethers you currently have awkward at best. Again, it\u2019s just an easy no. \n\nAll these y t a votes seem to be confusing what your mom CAN do with what she SHOULD do. You having the well established relationship already should make it clear to her that your BF\u2019s dad is just a bad idea out of respect for you. That conversation should never have even needed to happen because she should have shut down the entire premise in her own head the moment the thought first formed.\n\nEdit: a letter.

What a weird thing to say.", "I'm pretty sure Caitlin and Tyler from teen mom had this same situation, but her mom and his dad actually did get married! Then divorced...... \n\nI'm going to say NTA because it sounds like the whole conversation was a throwaway. You said something dramatic to shut the convo down, which it did. You should apologize to your mom for hurting her feelings, and then just agree to not being up the topic again. It's so far fetched (he has a gf, who knows if he would even be interested in your mom, plus he might find jt as weird as you do) that it's something you don't need to hash out. Cross that bridge when you get to it, but just know that bridge is most likely not going to be on your path.", "NTA. It\u2019s a firm boundary that you\u2019re not okay with your mother crossing, and she needs to respect that. \n\nI don\u2019t understand how that could \u201cbreak her heart\u201d, given that it\u2019s not even an option for her - your bfs father is obviously not interested and dating someone else. That\u2019s like saying I\u2019d be heartbroken if my family told me I couldn\u2019t date Henry Cavill. There\u2019s no chance so who cares? \n\nBut back to the point at hand, you are perfectly justified by being creeped out by your mother wanting a romantic relationship with your bfs father. There\u2019s a reason why step-sibling relationships are taboo. It\u2019s weird and uncomfortable.", "This makes my skin crawl. I see this as extremely disrespectful. The future in-laws shouldn\u2019t be in the dating pool. She doesn\u2019t want to spend time with him because he\u2019s taken! Wth. Even if she wanted your teacher you\u2019d still be in the right to stand your ground and say no way.

Your mother has every right to like someone, even your boyfriends father. You\u2019re the one with the problem. You need to grow up. There is nothing wrong with her liking him. Even after you get married he still isn\u2019t biological family so there is nothing incestuous about it.", "YBTA, she has just as much right to find a partner regardless of if you have 'dibs' on this family but also has a responsibility as the mature party to approach this better.\nRelationships are messy, get over it.", "Yes, YTA. Really? They are two consenting unrelated adults. Who are you to judge them? Then to threaten to disown her on top of that?  What if she threatened to disown you over who you dated?", "YTA, you\u2019re welcome to feel that way. But understand that\u2019s your hang-up, not your mother doing anything odd or unnatural. She met a complete stranger and felt an attraction, there\u2019s no reason that it should in anyway affect your relationship with your boyfriend. You\u2019re welcome to make the request, and that alone is a good reason for her to not pursue anything, but threatening to disown her as a mother is wayyyyyy to far.", "NTA\n\nno need to apologise, if anything your mum needs to apologise to you", "YTA.

She never disowned you and you pooped and barfed all over her at some point in your life.", "The fact that your mother could be happy in a non-existent relationship is enough for you to threaten to disown her means YTA. Your mother's supposed happiness with a hypothetical relationship that does not exist should not be a threat to you. They are grown adults not related by blood. Would it be weird? Absolutely. But once you are married, you are not her dependent anymore, and you don't get to dictate who your mother likes, has crushes on, or dates. You probably did break your mother's heart. You threatened to cut her out of your life.", "What is wrong with you and your boyfriend? There is no blood relationship here! You, both of you, have no say what so ever in who your parents date or marry. Grow up.

Unless the impact on you is worse that ending your relationship with your mother, I think your mon deserves an apology. If it\u2019s not worse, I think that she probably deserves a kind, empathetic, respectful conversation where you explain that to her and allow her to make decisions with that knowledge.", "YTA Calm down.", "NTA- from the 7+ billion humans in the world she sounds like she's really up for giving it a shot with your father in law, especially after you've expressed how you feel about it, so her attraction to someone is more important than her child's feelings.

Now her son and daughter in law r  technically step siblings and there\u2019s loads of drama.", "They aren\u2019t related, and them getting together wouldn\u2019t make you and your bf related, so I don\u2019t see the problem here. Yah it\u2019s a bit weird, but no one is related by blood so it\u2019s all good.", "NTA. Thats just weird and creepy. Of all the men on the planet it should be a given that the parents of your significant other are strictly off limits.", "I'm going to get down voted to hell for this, but everyone on here telling you that you're an asshole is delusional.\n\nYour response to that conversation, hypothetical or not is bang on the money. Sure, she can do and date whoever she wants. But, if she would be willing to date your partners dad, after you and your partner have been together for years and are thinking about marriage, that's just plain weird and all kinds of messed up. That's a line that a sane and well adjusted person just wouldn't cross. And for her to dig her heels in this much over it is a concern.\n\nYou are NTA.", "Unusual age difference between you and your mom. Look, you're allowed to be uncomfortable about it, but she's *66* and you're 23. Even if they got together, you wouldn't actually get a weird step-sibling relationship out of this. You wouldn't get a half-sibling related to both you and your boyfriend. And it's not going to happen because he's got a girlfriend anyways. You're policing your mother's attraction, and for what?\n\nYTA. If you're going to get weirded out about who she likes, just tell her you don't want her to discuss that with you in the future.", "YTA. If the idea of your mom dating your FIL grosses you out, you probably don't want to marry your husband... You aren't biologically related, and at adulthood, Step doesn't really exist anymore. And it's not like he would adopt you as an adult, which can be done legally.", "YTA because of where you took the conversation.   You need to develop more options than the worst one possible if you feel like you're not winning an argument.   \n\nThat escalated so quickly.   From talking to yelling to throwing away the whole relationship.   And you're quite right not to debate the morality of the argument because it's not the point.   The problem is with you believing you have the only morally correct viewpoint and then wishing to control others to live by your rules.  That will probably never work out well for you.  So to win you will present the final card.   Break up the relationship.   Or quit the job, or otherwise try to use a sledgehammer to hurt a person into submission.   \n\nAs you have seen here, there will be consequences for you that you won't have considered.   I can see that you still feel righteous about this and don't accept the consequences.   You won't hear me but I'll say it.... one day those consequences will be more than you can foresee.  Regret will come too late and guilt will not change a thing.   \n\nPlease listen now and learn how to argue.  There's great techniques you can learn and enhance communication across your whole life.  As a start I'd recommend reading Crucial Conversations.", "I'm personally shocked that there are so many N T A votes. I saw a post here recently about a woman who threatened to cut off her daughter and step-son who started dating while at college. They hadn't grown up together and barely knew each other before college. Everyone called her disgusting, cruel, and a bad mom because \"they're not related\" \"they're consenting adults\" \"they didn't grow up together\" and, \"stop trying to control who your kid sleeps with\"\n\nSomehow the reverse is completely unacceptable for Redditors though?", "YTA..  he is absolutely no relation to you.. leave her to see what happens..", "They are 2 grown consenting adults may I ask why is it a big deal to you? Would you rather them find love and you know it will be good and healthy for them? Its not like they are related they just have kids who love each other aswell. Besides itll make the holidays alot easier lol.", "YTA\nStop trying to control your mother.", "YTA. This is not a problem except in your head.  \n\n\nI've actually known a family where this happened.", "ESH your mom has a crush. You get to have whatever feelings you want and your mom sucks for trying to talk you out of your feelings. But your feelings. Also, don\u2019t get to dictate who your mom dates or has a crush on. So, just like she sucks for trying to talk you out of your feelings you suck for trying to tell her that if she actually goes through with her crush, then you won\u2019t be in her life. That\u2019s some seriously controlling stuff right there. Maybe you learned it from her but you should know now that people, including your parents, and any other family member literally does not have to stop doing or living their own life because it makes you uncomfortable. especially if whatever they\u2019re doing doesn\u2019t harm anyone.", "YTA\n\nIf you love your mom and she's 66, think about it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
