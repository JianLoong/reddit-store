How were you supposed to know she still wanted to shower, etc? It was an honest misunderstanding, I'm guessing you guys bothered to argue about it because you're both tired from not getting a real night's sleep. Go buy some overpriced airport lattes and enjoy your trip!", "NTA\n\nYou did wake her up. I\u2019m sure the time it takes to shower and get dressed wouldn\u2019t have made that big of a difference for her. If your wife was serious about having enough time to do her hair and stuff she should have set several alarms before going back to bed. Instead it sounds like she went back to bed, counted on the fact that you\u2019d be up at 1, and assumed you\u2019d wake her up at that time.", "INFO - why would you assume she got up, then went back to bed?", "NAH.\n\nIt would have been nice to check with her that she meant to be sleeping, 1 am is not when I expect expansive thought and consideration from anyone. I know that when I get up like that I am on autopilot. Whatever the plan was is what I\u2019m going to be doing, I don\u2019t have the brain power to think on the fly.\n\nOn the other hand, I can promise her that no one other than her at the airport cared about her hair. Airports are a survival situation, like a jungle. Everyone is just trying to get through it without eating each other or losing a limb. \n\nI\u2019m glad you both made your flight and I hope you have a lovely trip, it sounds like she\u2019s really excited for it.", "NAH - your wife should have set an alarm. You should've woke her or given her a chance to get up, but your NTA because you didnt. It was a poor judgement call on your part. She was obviously prepared, being that she was packed and ready two weeks ago.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Best lessons are the hard lessons.", "NTA", "It's not your fault she didn't set the alarm.  NTAH.", "She got on the plane? ...Then who cares. NAH You didn't wrong her and she didn't wrong herself.", "Oh my lord just STOP ARGUING and enjoy your vacay!!! You guys need a couple of drinks, some stupid fart jokes and some smooching. Off you go!", "Y\u2019all are both TA\u2019s. Apologized to each other before you start your vacation together, what\u2019s this shit of one of you wanting to be right??? Next time she will set an alarm and next time you will wake her up. Stop with the dramatics and grow up and have fun on your vacation together.", "YTA\n\nI cannot imagine playing these games with my spouse. They wouldn\u2019t pull this crap with me nor I with them. \n\nI guess you\u2019re the bestest in your mind, but you hurt your life partner, so that feels like such a shallow victory when all you had to do is make sure they were awake.", "YTA, even if she did shower and forgot to set her alarm, just give her a nudge and let her know the time. If she went back to sleep then NTA - but why bother playing games, help each-other out it\u2019s your damn holiday", "I think this is more appropriate for couples therapy than for an AITA post on reddit.", "I\u2019m single, so maybe I just don\u2019t get it. When one marries, does one lose the ability to be responsible for oneself and to communicate needs?", "not the asshole I guess but you probably could have paid closer attention. Like did her hair look washed or give her the sniff test", "NTA. She seems like a very well-prepared & prudent person in general, from what you've said of her. Seems reasonable to assume she hadn't overslept for an event she packed for two weeks ahead of time.", "That's the thing she forgot to set one entirely. She woke up in a sheer panic. But with her hair pulled up, we made it with great timing!", "Because she was already packed, it doesnt take her 2.5hrs to get ready. Usually 60-90mins tops.", "Thanks! She sure is. Even bought us matching Baecation couples trip tees! I wore the shirt, I feel like she ultimately won!", "I can accept the partial responsibility... and still take the W! haha", "We did make it in ample time. but sometimes we want to win the small battles! haha Thank you for the response.", "That's pretty close to how it went too! Good call!", "We're having a blast so far, and I can agree.... sometimes, we can be Partner Assholes in crime. haha", "This seems a pretty harsh indictment for someone letting their partner sleep a bit more on a very short night when they got there fine anyway. \n\nI'm not going to judge her for feeling the need to do her hair for a plane trip, but it does feel like that was an extra that OP could have reasonably assumed was lower priority than getting some sleep. Especially if she was driving the two hours and needed to be alert (if not I'm not sure it's really very fair to spend the trip antagonizing the driver.)", "Every relationship is different. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f But even when we argue, it often ends in friendly competitive banter with either of us owning the Asshole card in that moment. (But as a man, I automatically own it a lot!) haha But my Wife appreciates your vote!", "It's about getting that small victory. But with Mimosas on the start of our vacation, we fill we both won! My wife appreciates your vote!", "Thanks for the response. In the first instance, she was pretty upset. but once we hit the road, it was some playful bickering. But she still thinks I'm wrong. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Good! Enjoy it and stay safe y\u2019all!", "Right!? I drove. take your 2nd nap and leave me alone! haha Which she did after we agreed to let Reddit judge."]}
