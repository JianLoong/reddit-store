I don\u2019t understand people who are telling you that you are delusional. You\u2019re not. I wouldn\u2019t sit on someone else\u2019s lap unless it was a female. Not in a man\u2019s lap. This is weird to me. My partner would freak out.", "NTA\n\nThis would be unacceptable behaviour for me or my partner. Would be a straight break up and move on for me. \n\nYou\u2019re looking for someone with similar values who you respect to pair up with in life.", "NTA, your uncomfortable and thats that, reverse the roles and have another girl sit on your lap and see if she's ok with it", "i'm gonna go with NTA because i know i would absolutely not be okay with it if i had a bf and he had a girl sitting on his lap, but i think this is something you guys are not going to agree on", "You\u2019re definitely NTA, there are definitely boundaries and each relationship, and it just so happens she crossed that with you when sitting on that persons lap. I find it strange and quite assured to be honest why they thought that was okay? Although there was nothing sexual, it\u2019s still crossing a line and that\u2019s okay. As long as you communicated with her properly why that isn\u2019t okay then that\u2019s fine", "NTA", "NTA-there's different limits people have in relationships but it's understandable to not be happy and not want a relationship if your partner lets someone sit in their lap/sits on someone's lap that's not you.", "NTA. Why is the guy's girlfriend not sitting on his lap so that your girlfriend can have a seat?", "YTA for the way you handled it, not for being uncomfortable over the act itself.", "YTA. Not for feeling uncomfortable with something but the way you handled it. If his girl is sitting next to them it's definitely just fun among friends and you shouldn't react like this with an ultimatum.\n\nWhat you can do is talk to her in private and tell her you were definitely not worried about it but you did feel uncomfortable. You ha the right to feel uncomfortable, but if she's not doing anything clearly wrong your reaction shouldn't be an ultimatum.", "YTA. You admit it was nothing sexual, so this is about control. Oh, and I call b.s. on the no jealousy thing, otherwise.this wouldn't be an issue.", "Well, she dodged a bullet.\n\nYTA.", "YTA.\nWhile it may or may not be a good idea to sit on someones lap (personally i see no problem, i wouldnt mind if my hb had a female friend sitting on his lap, nor would he mind if i sat on a friends lap. Provided nothing sexual is going on, and you stated this was not the case)\n\nHowever, the way you handled it was way overboard. You could have talked about it in a normal way and see if you could come to an agreement where you are comfortable and she wouldnt feel like youre controlling her.\n\nEveryone saying that \"normal people dont do this\" should get a reality check.

A controlling asshole at that. I hope your girlfriend doesn\u2019t put up with your bullshit, and that you learn how to treat women properly.", "Info: did your gf know that you consider sitting in someone's lap inappropriate?\n\nBc gotta say, this sounds like an YTA situation considering that apparently no-one (including you) saw anything sexual in said situation.
