{"id": 29436, "submission_id": "17dskcp", "title": "AITA for not paying the full amount for a family style dinner where I only ate bread?", "selftext": "\nMy wife and I are both vegan, but we don't make a big deal out of it. We don't judge others for their choices and we don't expect them to accommodate us. We usually just find something we can eat wherever we go, or eat beforehand if we know the options are limited.\n\nOne of my friends invited us to his birthday dinner at a restaurant in Brooklyn. He said it was a last minute thing and he didn't have time to make reservations, so we just had to show up and hope for the best. We checked the menu online and saw that there were not many vegan options, except for chips and guacamole, hummus, and bread. We decided to eat a snack at home and then order drinks and appetizers at the restaurant.\n\nWe also have been tight with money lately because of some medical expenses, so we didn't want to spend too much on food we couldn't eat anyway.\n\nWhen we got to the restaurant, we found out that they were doing it all family style and splitting the bill evenly among everyone. There were about 15 people in our group, and they ordered a lot of food, most of which was meat or cheese based. The only thing we could eat was the bread, so we just had a couple of slices each and two beers each.\n\nAt the end of the night, my friend sent me a Venmo request for $120 for our share of the dinner. I was shocked by the amount, since our four drinks were only $32 plus tip, so about $40. I texted him back and explained that we didn't know it was going to be family style, and that we only had the beers and some bread. I said I would send him $60 to cover our drinks and a bit extra for the bread.\n\nHe got angry and said that we should have told him we were vegan, and that it was rude to not participate in the family style dinner. He said that everyone else paid their fair share, and that we were being cheap and selfish. He said that he expected us to pay the full amount. \n\nThe decision to make it a \u201cfamily style\u201d meal was done last second too because the restaurant had no idea a party of 15 was showing up. Otherwise we could have split the bill per party and been fine. \n\nI don't think we did anything wrong. We didn't ask for any special treatment, and we didn't complain about the food. We just ate what we could and tried to have a good time. We also didn't want to make a scene or cause any drama by announcing our dietary preferences. We thought $60 was more than enough for what we consumed, and we didn't want to pay for food we couldn't eat.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697979054, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17dskcp/aita_for_not_paying_the_full_amount_for_a_family/", "score": 6181, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I hate this method of paying for meals but if you know it\u2019s going to be split up like that, it\u2019s probably better to speak up early than wait until after the meal is over to negotiate what\u2019s fair for you. It\u2019s also tough to be the person who has to request payments from everybody at the end of a meal and I\u2019m wondering if he got stuck paying double or if the rest of the party made up for the other half of what he\u2019d requested from you.", "YTA because of this:\n\n>When we got to the restaurant, we found out that they were doing it all family style and splitting the bill evenly among everyone.\n\nYou knew it would be a problem from the start.

For a few reasons 1. That\u2019s just how bill splitting works as adults, everyone pays it evenly, if you can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to participate leads me to reason 2. You learned upon arrival it was going to split evenly, you also knew going in you weren\u2019t going to be getting anything other than drinks and maybe an app. You should have communicated this to your friend up front and decide a compromise from there. By not doing so you agreed to pay the same as everyone else.", "ESH It is also pretty obvious that check division could be an issue once a group moves to family style.  \n\nI have run into this as a Vegetarian.  You either need to advocate for yourself for items you can eat, order separate, or make it clear you are not part of the family style meal.  Your lack of communication put your friend in a position that they either needed to go back to everyone else and ask for more or pick up your difference.\n\nI would consider it a lesson learned. People aren\u2019t watching what you are eating in a family style scenario to proactively ask you if you want to be removed from the bill.", "YTA for not saying something before food was ordered. When they said it was family style, you should have spoke up then, not when the bill came.", "Miscommunication. ESH.\n\nThought exercise. Your friend either has to pony up himself, or more likely text the other 11-12 people and say \u201cok listen everyone.

So, your friend is under the assumption that everyone is paying the same amount, (because nothing was said to anyone), so when dividing the bill, he went by that assumption.  Now everyone paid and he cannot go back to them and ask for more.  But I also have to wonder, was he included in that total?  Or, as the birthday boy, did he consider his meal paid for.  Either way, the time to say something is before everyone orders.", "ESH. Your friend is definitely a jerk but you\u2019re also at fault for saying literally nothing about it to anyone.

Menu looks good.  Enjoy.\"\n\nWould that have really been so difficult?  \n\nBringing it up afterwards feels a bit AH-ish to me.", "How does your friend not know your vegan?", "Gonna go against the grain and say YTA for not making it clearer to the group. \n\n> When we got to the restaurant, we found out that they were doing it all family style and splitting the bill evenly among everyone.\n\nYou knew at the start what the deal was and you said nothing. This is when you have to fess up and say \"we are not taking part\". It's awkward, but its the only fair thing to do.\n\n> At the end of the night, my friend sent me a Venmo request for $120 for our share of the dinner. I was shocked by the amount\n\nYou shouldn't have been shocked, because you knew what you signed up for. You knew beforehand that this wasn't paying individually. \n\nYou are the asshole if you don't pay the full amount now. Your friend can't go back to everyone else and say \"OnlyFox774 only had a small amount of food so he's paying less, so you need to pay me $7 more to make up for his lower contribution\". Realistically, if you don't pay, he's the one out of $60. This was your mistake, so you should pay. And next time, have some backbone and say \"Sorry guys I don't want to take part\" instead of hiding behind the awkwardness. It's unfair to everyone and causing more discomfort in the long term.\n\n> We also didn't want to make a scene or cause any drama by announcing our dietary preferences.\n\nWell you made the scene and drama now. You didn't avoid any drama at all, in fact you caused more from being a coward. Saying you don't want to take part is whatever and it'll be forgotten in seconds. Causing money problems between friends is a big issue.", "Nta trust me I hate that like let me pay for what my family ordered, we always get water and small dishes when out with family while they get wine, multiple dishes and desserts.

Don't worry about us! Please enjoy\"", "So normally I'm against the splitting bills evenly. But the time to speak up would have been when you noticed they were doing family style. They were ordering enough for the whole table. If they didn't know you were vegan, how would they know to leave you out of the estimated needed amount of food? I do think it's kind of an ahole move to participate in a family style dinner and only say something afterwards.

I don\u2019t think you were wrong for not wanting to pay for the food you didn\u2019t eat but you should have asked for a separate check for the drinks at the time. With 15 people, the host probably didn\u2019t notice that you didn\u2019t eat more than bread. Now he will either have to eat your portion or go back and ask the others for more money. That isn\u2019t fair to him either.", "YTA for not doing something when you became aware of the situation.

They order based on number of people, and unless you\u2019re wearing some sign indicating you\u2019re vegan and not participating, food was ordered for you. \nCan the family style approach be unfair? Yes. But you should have spoken up and told them not to include you in the food count. Since you didn\u2019t, the bill was higher than it otherwise would have been. And now you\u2019re telling your friend who\u2019s bday it was that you aren\u2019t paying? So he covers your portion?

We don't judge others for their choices and we don't expect them to accommodate us. We usually just find something we can eat wherever we go, or eat beforehand if we know the options are limited.\n\nOne of my friends invited us to his birthday dinner at a restaurant in Brooklyn. He said it was a last minute thing and he didn't have time to make reservations, so we just had to show up and hope for the best. We checked the menu online and saw that there were not many vegan options, except for chips and guacamole, hummus, and bread. We decided to eat a snack at home and then order drinks and appetizers at the restaurant.\n\nWe also have been tight with money lately because of some medical expenses, so we didn't want to spend too much on food we couldn't eat anyway.\n\nWhen we got to the restaurant, we found out that they were doing it all family style and splitting the bill evenly among everyone. There were about 15 people in our group, and they ordered a lot of food, most of which was meat or cheese based. The only thing we could eat was the bread, so we just had a couple of slices each and two beers each.\n\nAt the end of the night, my friend sent me a Venmo request for $120 for our share of the dinner. I was shocked by the amount, since our four drinks were only $32 plus tip, so about $40. I texted him back and explained that we didn't know it was going to be family style, and that we only had the beers and some bread. I said I would send him $60 to cover our drinks and a bit extra for the bread.\n\nHe got angry and said that we should have told him we were vegan, and that it was rude to not participate in the family style dinner. He said that everyone else paid their fair share, and that we were being cheap and selfish. He said that he expected us to pay the full amount. \n\nThe decision to make it a \u201cfamily style\u201d meal was done last second too because the restaurant had no idea a party of 15 was showing up. Otherwise we could have split the bill per party and been fine. \n\nI don't think we did anything wrong. We didn't ask for any special treatment, and we didn't complain about the food. We just ate what we could and tried to have a good time. We also didn't want to make a scene or cause any drama by announcing our dietary preferences. We thought $60 was more than enough for what we consumed, and we didn't want to pay for food we couldn't eat.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Pay your share. It's the only decent thing to do after that.", "Here's the problem- when you order \"family style,\" at least where I'm from, they charge you a set amount per person.

So if you knew you weren't going to be able to eat much of anything and did not want to pay the family style meal price, you needed to say that up front.\n\nI get that your intentions were good and you were trying to go with the flow and not make a fuss. But now you're in this situation where your friend got charged for food you didn't eat, you don't want to pay for it because you didn't eat it, but I can see why they don't want to pay for it either. All of this could have been prevented by having a quick word with your friend and/ or the waiter about the fact that you and your wife are vegans and couldn't eat what was on offer. The restaurant probably would have made an exception for you to sit at the table without being charged. The other problem is that your friend has requested money from all of his other friends assuming the check would be split 15 ways.
