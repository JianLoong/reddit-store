About two months ago, I was moved to a new building with all new coworkers, including Barb (not her real name). She is very outward with her opinions and is constantly complaining about the latest leftist scheme, but more specifically, the \u201ctrans liberal agenda\u201d. As we both work later shifts, I often fall victim to these rants.\n\nNow, it should be known that Barb is a huge gossip. In just the small amount of time I\u2019ve been there, I\u2019ve overheard her trash-talking the majority of our coworkers, myself included. Other than telling her off for in-office socializing, HR hasn\u2019t done much of anything about it.\n\nNow for what happened.\n\nIt started in the bathroom where I\u2019d been on the phone with my mother. Near the end of the call, she called me by a childhood nickname which I\u2019d never been a fan of, so I obviously corrected her. I basically said something like \u201cIt\u2019s (Name). No, it isn\u2019t \u2018what I prefer\u2019, it\u2019s literally just my name\u201d.  I then heard Barb clear her throat from inside a stall and no matter how small the evidence, I immediately knew what she had thought. \n\nEven though she hadn\u2019t said anything after that (though I\u2019m sure she told someone and I just wasn\u2019t around to hear it), I decided it would be funny to drive it further. \n\nI made it a point to \u201caccidentally\u201d show Barb a childhood picture of my brother, who -while not identical- was very similar to me back in the day. I started speaking in a deep voice whenever I \u201cthought nobody was around\u201d. At one point, with her watching, I signed a document with an extremely masculine name, and proceeded to scratch it out before going to print off a new copy.\n\nI knew I had her when she started a typical \u201cWe Can Always Tell\u201d rant to the whole office while staring for my reaction. She even announced how uncomfortable she was with me using the women\u2019s bathroom.\n\nFinally, when I had a coworker inform me that Barb had been referring to me as a man and had \u201coutted me\u201d to everyone, I acted like I had no idea where the assumption had come from. I showed them pictures of me as a kid, like when I did cheer in middle school, or had a princess-themed birthday at 9. All in all, I pretended to be completely clueless, and it made Barb out to be an absolute fool. I even referenced her \u201cWe can always tell\u201d speech back at her when she threw a fit about it all.\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t care at all about Barb\u2019s feelings- but morally, AITA for  pretending to be trans?", "created_utc": 1691120442, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15hp1sd/aita_for_pretending_to_be_trans/", "score": 453, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
