Your sisters sound horrible tbh, if you\u2019re setting a clear rule for everyone, you\u2019re not obliged to help them out", "NTA - sounds like it\u2019s time to disinvite Ann from your wedding. The drink thing aside, if she\u2019s feeling a certain type a way about you having money when she doesn\u2019t, she may try to sabotage your wedding as a way to get back at you.", "NTA. First of all, I'm guessing this is your fiance's money that he received and not yours. Obviously, that doesn't matter since you're getting married to him and he has generously used this money to provide a nice life for you and your kids.\n\nYour SISTERS are not entitled to any of his/your money. They can get jobs. They can do what they need to to pay off their own debt and provide for their own family. The fact that your sister is threatening to not come to your wedding unless you pay for stuff for her (beyond what you've already paid) shows just how transactional her relationship is with you. She cares about money, not you. If you allow this to continue, it will not stop at the wedding.\n\nSo long, sister.", "NTA\n\nYour sisters entitlement is gross.", "NTA \n\nIf you didn't tell her, she wouldn't even begged you to pay for her. But now that she knows that you got money, she is practically forcing you to pay for her. \n\n\"will call ann, sarah and ann are really close to eachother but not so much to me,\" \n\nThis, you aren't even as close to them as they are to eachother they are trying to milk you for your money. Your sisters are the AH, not you. Stay calm, and if it goes on cut contact, people like that just want something from you as long as they are benefiting. If you had no money, they wouldn't even ask you.", "NTA.  First, Sarah's debt is hers, not yours.  Second, Ann sounds beyond entitled and demanding.  Third, it is your money, that you came into due to a tragedy and are wisely spending it to ensure your comfort and happiness.   Nowhere in any of your birth certificates does it mention that you will assist anyone should you come into money; and not in any other birth certificates either.", "Your family is very drama filled!  I hope you can remove yourself a bit from it.  The money is yours.", "Grammar is important. Stay in school kids!", "NTA. Have you ever seen The lottery curse? NEVER tell your family when you come into a substantial amount of money or at least the amount. They become the most entitled, greedy people is most cases. Keep saying no. Perhaps uninvite her too!", "NTA.  Your sisters sound unreasonable, entitled, and, frankly, horrible.  Sorry about that.  Your fianc\u00e9's money is NOT their money.  Heck, your money is NOT their money.  They need to grow up and learn to be responsible for themselves and their choices.  Knowing this will probably not happen, it's important for you to set firm boundaries.  If they don't like this, tough.  They are in no way entitled to demand anything of you or your fianc\u00e9 monetarily. You won't be able to change or control them, so just set your boundaries and go forward as you deserve and do not feel guilty at all when you do not agree to their unreasonable demands.  Happy wedding!", "Nta\n\nAlso I just went to a wedding with a cash bar. Unless you pay for your drink then or give an atm card to close out, you will not get a drink. Cash bars are regional things.\n\n\nDisinvite her and move on. Also, give strict instructions to the venue. If someone does not give them payment, then they do not get a drink.\n\n\nMost cash bars have cards accepted as well. Entitlement in this post is gross.", "NTA for not paying for your sisters debt, kids, drinks, etc\n\nBut please tell me that there are more free options than tap water??? If that\u2019s the case you\u2019re the AH for that.  Iced tea? Lemonade? Coffee? Anything?", "NTA. Cut those leeches out of your live. this is horrible beheaver. Trying to get everything paid because 'sister has money and I don't want to work'.", "NTA. Not in any way at all.", "NTA. I received a windfall that I used to pay off some debt. I had nothing to lend or give because my debts and my present life had to be managed. (And I decided a long time ago, if I win the lottery for mega bucks - I am not telling a soul I know about it, because nothing motivates need like hearing someone just came into some money.)\n\nI love gifting my family. I just don't always have a means to do so. And I won't be made to feel guilty about that. So, if I win the da\\\\nged lottery, I'll write everyone a check and put it in their Christmas card and NEVER mention how I could afford the gift.\n\nsigh.\n\nPeople can really get on your nerves with entitlement, can't they?", "NTA and you would be well justified in going limited or no contact with this toxic person. You need that money for your family, not for your sister's partying needs.", "NTA and why tf are they entitled to your money? I would go NC. Fuck that!", "NTA\n\nThese sound like people you need to be no contact with. Money really can bring out the worst in people. Envy and greed can destroy relationships.", "Grammar is important. Stay in school kids!", "ESH. Your sister's attitude/entitlement is egregious but can we have a moment to discuss not only a cash bar, but a cash bar where there isn't even an ATM??? I get cultural norms different but is this really \"ok\" in your world? My goodness, especially if we know you got money.", "NTA. It's your money not hets", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A person runs into money through a tragedy or upsetting event, and everyone around them feels entitled to \"their share\". Your sister isn't being fair to you.

Maybe a tea/coffee at the end of the meal, but if you wanted more than one you went to the bar and paid.", "the venue is at a hall that was owned by a relative that recently passed away and my partner was really close to so wanted it there so they could still be apart of it in some way", "So because someone has money, they're expected to cover the drinks for everyone?

I\u2019ve never been to a wedding without an open bar, it\u2019s definitely not common in my area.\n\nBut I\u2019ve been to/planned tons of other events - fundraisers, etc at venues and they\u2019ve all included a drink package with the menu.  Basically always lemonade and tea.  Sodas would be an extra package (or cash bar) and same with alcohol. \n\nThat might be an unpleasant surprise for guests if they\u2019re thinking they don\u2019t mind not drinking but don\u2019t realize that \u201cbar\u201d means any beverage.", "Hey, we are from different places in the world with different cultures.

Granted, they usually take credit cards, but this one doesn't, so she's let people know ahead of time. Easy enough.", "Again, its cultural. Cash bars in my world mean 2 things: 1) They can't afford it or 2) They have an aversion to purchasing of alcohol.  The reception/party is the only reason people are even going to your shinding if we aren't family. If I'm paying for that, Ill go elsewhere. But completely understand if its just a cultural/regional thing.", "In a lot of places it\u2019s an insurance issue as well. My state requires event insurance if you have an open bar and it\u2019s around $2k+ for weddings. The options are cash bar or open bar, not this keg is free then you\u2019re on your own. If you\u2019re under the age of 25 most of the companies won\u2019t approve you either.", "I grew up in a rural area and generally weddings were cash bars because the wedding dance was open to everyone. The dinner was invite only but anyone could come to the dance, so cash bars make sense. Weddings were considered community events.", "Oh yea, I'm in Louisiana. lol no such restrictions. Shit, we barely can get companies to insure our homes.", "It\u2019s venue and size of group specific most of the time. If you want a 35 person wedding you\u2019re probably fine, anything over 100 and you need it. If it\u2019s a historical building or country club here it doesn\u2019t matter that size, it\u2019s required."]}
