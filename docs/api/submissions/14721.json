The oncologists first words were \"This is an uncurable diagnosis\" and \"The rest of your life will be palliative\". Obviously, we were upset. We celebrated our 20th anniversary last October and have 2 kids (14M,16F). Since the diagnosis, the doctors have prescribed an aggressive chemo plan that she has endured surprisingly well. After the first set of scans following initial scans there was overall reduction in tumor sizes everywhere as seen on a CT scan. Dr is concerned about another area and wanted a PET scan performed in 2 months.\n\nDuring this time I run into a buddy of mine from college who is an oncologist. I gave him the information and he told me that most likely I can count on three years, but survival is highly unlikely. Every time I asked him \"what about these success stories my wife is reading online?\" His response \"Be careful most people don't have a good handle on their diagnosis and tend to make them worse than they were\u201d (this actually happened last week a colleague reached out saying she was a stage 4 survivor, she was not stage 4).\n\nDuring this time my wife continues to remain unbelievably positive to the point that she had me convinced she was going to beat this diagnosis (Note: It's very rare that anyone beats this- I will not go into specifics because \"everyone knows someone\" and most are not comparable). She continues to consume positive stories of success and keeps telling me \"this isn't taking me out\".  Yesterday she goes for chemo and sees the doctor before the infusion begins. Prior to leaving the house I ask her if it's ok if I speak with the doctor alone. She's apprehensive and asks why. I said because I want answers to tough questions, many that she is ignoring (survival instinct?). I want answers because I feel I need to prepare my kids for her impending demise. She texts her friend for advice about this and her friend was neutral and told her it was up to her. She gave me consent to speak with the doctor alone.\n\nWe meet with the doctor prior to the infusion as usual and my wife informs the doctor that I'd like to speak to him alone. He verifies with her that this is ok and she goes on to infusion. I talk with the doctor for about 40 minutes. He is the third oncologist that has now told me that the diagnosis remains \"uncurable\" and \"palliative\". That time involved lots of information regarding blood work, kids, quality of life, etc, but the diagnosis is the important part. I leave the office and head to see my wife. She asks me what we talked about. At first I refused to tell her, and say I don't want to share. I gave her three \"are you sure?\" to which she replied yes to all. I told her she wouldn't want to hear it, but she insisted. So I told her... She replied by saying \"I refuse to accept that\".

She needs to be positive... you need to prepare your kids. Please. Please talk to them. My parents weren't forthcoming about my mother's cancer.

Don't do that to them.", "NAH - You're both trying to do the best you can to deal with a difficult situation. You're trying to keep realistic and get all of the facts, she's trying to stay positive.\n\nBear in mind that staying positive is not necessarily being stupid or ignorant - positive thinking can be a huge factor in your health, and may be a large part of what is helping your wife to get through this. If she was defeatist, she might not have lasted as long, or might have been less able to enjoy the limited time she has left.\n\nLikewise, you're right to want to be prepared with the facts - you're not only going to be with her during this difficult journey, but you're also going to need to prepare for everything that comes after, including ensuring your kids are all taking everything well enough.\n\nI think both of you are approaching this as best you can. As for telling her... well, she did ask, and kept insisting. It would have been an AH move to hide it from her at that point. However, even if you disagree with her positive outlook, you can still *support* her in her positive outlook - it's what's giving her a sense of purpose right now, so be careful not to take that from her.\n\nYou will want to make sure that affairs are in order \"just in case\", of course. But if she insists on moving forward with the mindset of \"I'm surviving this\", then let her have that.", "~~N T A~~  NAH This is her coping method. Support her fight, but prepare yourself and the kids for the future.\n\nThe truth is that none of us know when our time is up.  She has been given a hint. Celebrate and enjoy the time you have remaining.\n\nedited to fix judgement accuracy.", "I'm going to have to go with NAH.   \nOP, I think you are smart to get the real real from her doc - you have kids and a shared life, and you should know what you need to prepare for.  Your wife asked to hear what you learned, you gave her a few opps to not hear it, and she opted to hear it.  From what it sounds like, you just told her what you learned, and didn't share any opinions of yours.  That's not an AH move.\n\nBut your wife certainly isn't an AH for wanting to be positive. As a mom myself, it would take me a really, really, really long time to come to terms with the thought of leaving my kids. I'm getting emotional just thinking about it now. The bombshell diagnosis and the aggressive treatment has undoubtedly been really hard for her.  Let her be positive - it may be all she has.\n\nI'm sorry you're having to deal with this - sending good vibes to all of you.", "NAH.  She is the one dying so I'm not going to judge her for her misplaced optimism.  However you absolutely need to have a realistic outlook on this, because you are the one who will have to carry on after she passes and pick up the pieces.  It isn't fair for you to have to pretend everything is going to be ok up until the point where her condition is so bad she has to accept reality.", "NAH. She is capable of making choices and she wanted the information.\n\nMy thoughts are that as long as she is not making irrational choices based on her optimism (refusing to make a will, planning activities that will cause her harm) let her be optimistic. From your post it sounds like you are doing this and just needed a realistic perspective for your own benefit.\n\nIf hope helps her manage then let her have all the hope. But you didn\u2019t want to lie to your partner when she demanded the information.", "Given the multiple assurances and reassurances that your wife wanted to know what the doctor said, you acted rationally and understandably. Situations like this are difficult for all parties involved, and you seem to be trying your best considering everything. Definitely not the asshole", "NAH - I\u2019m sorry for what your wife and your family are going through and there\u2019s really not going to be an answer on what you should or shouldnt be doing I feel. \n\nIf I were you I would recommend you and your wife speak to a therapist about this - this may help your wife come to terms with her diagnosis and help you learn ways to speak to her (and your children) about it.", "I am overjoyed any time someone beats the odds at cancer, but that is so rare. There are practical concerns to deal with here too. I am glad your wife is so positive, but if 3 oncologists have told you both this is palliative care, you need to inform your kids and get them ready about the possibly limited time their mom has with them. You and your wife need to plan her bequests and write a will, decide on medical power of attorney, end of life hospice care, etc. If amazing things happen, you won't need to worry about these issues any more. But otherwise, doing the legal paperwork while being overwhelmed with grief is the worst thing in the universe. NAH. Wishing you and your wife all the strength.", "NTA and I say that as someone who is on chemo, with a terminal diagnosis. Her being positive is imperative to her outcomes (and I use the plural as there are many separate issues/events involved with a terminal diagnosis), but your sharing the truth (again) with her does not qualify as TA behavior. At some point, she will decide to either accept or not accept her diagnosis, but regardless of her choice, you being aware of what to expect is important, and will help you and your children deal with your wife\u2019s end of life.", "NAH but I think you could have handled it better.\n\nMy second wife passed after an eight-year battle with breast cancer.  At diagnosis her oncodoc gave her 18 months and like I said, she hung on for eight years.\n\nI went the same route you did, trying to face the hard truth that she was gonna die sooner rather than later.  Her dad who was a doc told me that what she really needed right now was a positive attitude and that it was my role to help her maintain that.\n\nHe was not wrong.\n\nBut - I get it.  A terminal cancer diagnosis is devastating news and everyone reacts to devastation differently.  But - if she wants to stay positive and believe she can beat the thing (and it is possible she can) then IMO you really need to support that.  She's doing what she needs to keep going - and right now reality isn't particularly helpful.  There will be plenty of time to get real if things do progress.\n\nWarm thoughts to your whole family -", "NAH - You shared information after she said yes after three inquiries.\n\nYou wife has the right to be hopeful no matter the information provided. I think this is where you are stuck. You have difficulty watching her have hope. You are married but this does not imply you need to view things the same. Best to you. This is a cruel and heartless disease. Be good to yourself.", "NAH, she needs to fight this her way, and you need to prepare for after. I do worry that her optimism will prevent her from making memories and doing things like video journals for the kids.", "NAH\n\nShe did ask you what you had talked about with the doctor. I think if she hadn\u2019t asked, you shouldn\u2019t have told her, but since she kept asking it\u2019s another story. \nI get wanting to prepare your kids. That maybe could have been a conversation you had with your kids about the real state of your wife, and she could have kept her positive outlook. You really need that sometimes in her position. I get that from the outside and as the other person it\u2019s really painful, but sometimes she needs that. \n\nI don\u2019t think you did anything wrong by telling her after she asked so many times. It\u2019s a tricky situation.", "NTA but allow her to cope.", "NTA\n\nYou told her what the medical professionals say.  She chooses not to accept it.\n\nIt's entirely possible (though unlikely) that she will beat this thing.\n\nYour children are aware of her diagnosis and treatment.  \n\nWhen (if) the treatments stop working will be the time to have a serious discussion with your children.\n\nHugs and Prayers to your wife, children and you", "NAH this is so sad I'm really sorry. You can't possibly think she could be TA for being in denial about dying. She doesn't want to leave you & her babies. I'm so sorry OP. I have no suggestions other than try to love on her as much as you can & look into getting a therapist now before shes gone. Having a professional to help you get through this could be a wonderful tool to help keep her passing as.... positive for lack of a better term... As possible. Ugh my heart hurts so bad for you guys.

I think it\u2019s reasonable and honestly responsible to prepare for the worst and to be realistic. It\u2019s smart to have a plan, but at the same time it\u2019s a bit harsh. I can see how she may feel you are giving up on her, even if your intentions are to keep your kids best interest though. I know you asked for her permission to talk with her doctor in private, but given the subject matter, she may also see it as deceitful. I totally get your intention, so I can\u2019t bring myself to fully label you AH. I think her feelings just need to be considered as much as the facts on this one.\n\nYou seem to be trying your very best to navigate this difficult situation, which is admirable. You clearly care so much about everyone involved, and I think that\u2019s the most important part.", "NAH. I think it's right that you get the hard facts as it'll be you having to pick up the pieces after she's gone. She said she wanted the facts, you gave her three opportunities to change her mind, but she's in denial about her reality. That may change as the end gets closer, but if she wants to ignore the truth so she doesn't dwell on reality can you blame her?", "NAH. We often find ourselves in echo chambers on the internet. Your wife has found lots of beating the odds success stories. Other people will have the opposite experience and only read about the tragic deaths. Your wife is fighting for her life, and while she is probably not going to beat it, having a positive attitude could make the rest of her time more pleasant. I would have recommended talking to the doctor with your wife instead of alone, as it\u2019s her life and she deserves all the information. If she hears it directly from the doctor\u2019s mouth, it might carry more weight. I wish you the best.", "NAH, this is devastating for you and your family. You and your wife are dealing with it quite differently. It\u2019s admirable that she wants to fight this, and equally admirable that you want information that will help prepare you and your kids for what\u2019s to come.", "INFO did you think the doctor was saying anything to you that he hadn't told her?", "NAH - I am sorry you two have to deal with this. Now that you spoke directly with the dr, I would drop it, let her be optimistic. But you can make the necessary plans", "NAH it sucks all around. My dad did not want to believe he would die despite the fact gleioblastomas are 100% fatal and incurable. He kept denying it till he slipped into a coma. But I guess when your facing your own mortality you have to cope somehow. It really sucked when he kept telling everyone he would make it, and those that did not know it hurt them a lot when they found out he died. Sometimes that optimism can go a bit far. So try to stay realistic and support your wife however you can. Death sucks, no one really wants to ever accept that.", "NTA, my dad died on glioblastoma a little over two years ago. When he got diagnosed we thought be'd do well since he had stopped drinking, was exercising and overall healthy. They gave him 12-14 months but we figured that was just an estimate and heard plenty of stories about the miracle cases where they lived 10 years from their initial diagnosis. The first surgery went better than expected and he did pretty well for sometime so we got optimistic, but after the second surgery he really started to decline and probably around the year and a half mark he took a steep decline and passed away about 21 months after his diagnosis. Still you want to stay positive just not at the expense of avoiding dealing with the hard stuff, make sure she tells your kids everything she wants them to hear because by the time the end is near she may not be able to.", "Aww man NAH, she needs to hope and you need to be the rock based in reality for your kids. Just keep standing by her side, not sure if you're religious but I'll pray for your family tonight.", "NAH. \n\nI am sorry you're dealing with this, she's trying to cope and facing mortality is a huge thing, especially as your children are on the cusp of adulthood - she's trying hard to keep it together and hold onto a future she's planned for decades. My parent did the same and I was also in denial, right up to the death. Don't push it, focus on your time together and supporting your kids/yourself. \n\nThe road ahead is hard, when the decline comes - she may naturally accept it as she begins to feel more and more tired but there's no need to rush it right now. The important thing is gently broaching the topics of wills/final wishes and practically, I'd recommend getting samples of tangible memories for when she's gone, her handwriting, videos and audio of her voice as you all spend time together - it will be invaluable later on.", "Professional death doulas are a thing.

I am so sorry that this awful thing has happened to both of you.", "NTA for answering her honestly, but she clearly wants to fight like hell, and she can refuse to accept that if she wants. From here on out, you need to support her in whatever way she chooses to deal with this. That includes NOT divulging the doctor's POV with your kids.

And I\u2019m not saying your wife CAN cure herself. However, chemo is a hard thing to go through.

What do you win by being right?", "I'd say YTA, sure she wanted the information but that sort of news can crush someone even if they don't tell you outright or seem fine. Sure a lot of doctors will say she won't make it out but miracles do happen and a positive mindset makes a lot of difference, whereas negativity and stress has been shown to have a detrimental effect on recovery, the immune system etc.\n\nYou should stay positive and supportive for your wife not get her down or throw all that negativity on her. Do you think she isn't aware of that? That she isn't putting a brave face on just for you and the kids? Miracles can happen and they do, don't think that unlikely means she 100% won't make it because nothing is 100% certain and even small chances or 1% is still a chance.\n\nIt's good to be prepared but don't let it consume you and overall don't make it consume or let it consume your wife.

Personally, I'd have told the kids the details of the diagnosis but also told them that mom is positive and fighting as hard as she can, but the reality is that we are going to lose her, maybe soon, maybe in 3 years.

In the meantime she remained positive and did everything she could to live and have quality or life.", "NAH. It\u2019s very important for her to stay positive. You don\u2019t want her time left filled with hopelessness and depression. She\u2019ll realize it on her own soon enough. It\u2019s equally as important you and your kids are prepared for the eventuality of her death. \n\nThis is an awful situation all around and I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this.  Please look into support groups for people with loved ones dying of cancer. You don\u2019t have to wait until she\u2019s gone to get help.

She died 4 weeks after her diagnosis.", "NAH, you are trying to do your job, and you're in a tough situation, but also keep in mind, you must remain positive, and your wife has to remain positive to get the most out of her life whether she is on limited time or not.  Break someone's spirit and they often decline a lot faster.\n\nHonestly as far as your kids, if it were me, I'd explain the situation, but also explain that to give their mom the best shot they still gotta hope for the best, while being prepared for the worst.  \n\nAlso while you can be 99.999999999% sure of a medical diagnosis at times, you still NEVER know, there are some things that occur in medicine that can make no sense and perceived miracles can happen, doesn't mean they will, but they CAN.\n\nSo commend your wife for her fighting spirit, support her, because even if she loses her battle eventually, she went out fighting and not giving up, that will mean a lot to everyone, and especially the kids.", "YTA simply because palliative care only will never involve chemo. Palliative care is ONLY comfort care like pain relief, nutrition, hydration and hygiene and skin care.", "YTA. \n\nBro you have 3 doctors who have told you your wife will die. She has limited time left to enjoy her life. \n\nLet. Her. Fucking. Enjoy. It.", "NAH. When my husband was dying of colon cancer, he never seemed to acknowledge it at all. He didn\u2019t want to know anything, whereas I needed to know everything. I knew from a week after dx that he was going to die. I did like you and talked to the oncologist alone; the difference with our situation and yours was that he never asked what we talked about. You gave your wife 3 chances to back out of you telling her what you learned. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong there.\n\nI wanted my husband to face the fact he was dying - but he never did. After a long time of him being that way, I talked to the oncologist about what I saw as my husband\u2019s ignorance of reality; he said that many people do that as it is way too difficult for our minds to face our mortality head-on for long periods.\n\nAs hard as it is, you have to let her deal how she needs - but you also get to cope how you need to. I am so glad I knew and was able to prepare for my husband\u2019s death (as much as one possibly can, anyway) - but I don\u2019t have any idea how I would have been if the roles had been reversed.\n\nI am so sorry y\u2019all are having to go through this.", "NAH.. I've been going through my own cancer ordeal lately and it's a whole different ball game than you ever imagined. Granted my situation is not as dire as your wife's. But anyways, I think when doctors tell you it's beyond them, that there isn't any hope left, all you can do is rely on positive thinking. If it works, it works. I would just say, believe in her, but prepare for the worst.", "I am so sorry that your family is going through this. My late husband\u2019s oncologist told him that he won the \u201ccancer lottery\u201d that his was so rare and use his time wisely. That was the best advice because we didn\u2019t waste any time. We took extra vacations, we made family memories and lived life in spite of \u201ca death sentence\u201d. But most importantly those actions taught our kids (12F) and (9M) to live fully during probably the roughest thing anyone will endure. It\u2019s been 6 years since he\u2019s passed and keeping them in the loop helped them not only survive but they learned to thrive. Death comes for everyone (6 months or 60 years) and facing it head on is a healthy way.

Let your wife have all the hope she can find\u2026  surround yourself with support and remember to care for yourself too..

Look.  I get that you need to be realistic about this.  However, as a stage 3 cancer survivor hope is what gets us through the bad days.  With cancer treatment, there are a lot of bad days.  Hope is what keeps us fighting.  I call it spite that got me through it, but that's just an aggressive form of hope.  \n\nToxic positivity can be incredibly annoying and frankly dangerous in cancer communities, but there's nothing you've said that sounds like her outlook was actively damaging her treatment.\n\nWhile mine was always talked about as \"curable,\" there's a chance it will come back and I may end up on chemo for life.  My step brother was diagnosed months after me as terminal.  He just passed the line of having a 50% chance of living long enough to make and is currently stable.  You never know with cancer until all treatment options have been exhausted.", "NAH My stepfather was diagnosed with cancer and given a year to live.

So sorry to hear about her diagnosis but it is important for her to remain hopeful.", "NAH", "Unpopular but YTA. \n\nHaving a good attitude has shown to be helpful in cancer patients. \n\nYes, you were right to talk to the doctor.

You're doing the best you can.", "NTA. I think it\u2019s important to know exactly what the logistics of her diagnosis are. My dad was diagnosed with mantle cell Non Hodgkins and a rare form of leukemia which his oncologist said made it stage 4. Mom and Dad were both always very forthcoming that he may not be around long but that we needed to enjoy the time we had with him. Currently, it is in remission but his oncologist typically reminds us that it\u2019s more of a when it comes back than in if it comes back. Knowing that time is limited with a parent or a spouse really makes you more appreciative of the time you have with them.", "YTA. Let her fucking cope however she wants. Your friend is also a HUGE AH. it was extremely inappropriate for him to offer any kind medical opinion without examining your wife. Finally, many diseases are uncurable and focus on palliative care to improve symptoms and that palliative care lasts for years and years", "Tagging on to say that you can ask your palliative care doctor or social worker for assistance speaking with your children in age-appropriate ways. Social workers have resources to help with things like memory making for the future.\n\nIt's a tricky balance between hope and realism. Hope doesn't mean she doesn't *know*. I've learned to be more nuanced in my understanding of what \"beating this\" means. It does not always mean the patient thinks they will be cured of their disease forever.\n\nI want to share what one of my young patient's family said. They were upset that a nurse had said something like, \"You know this is incurable, right?\" The nurse was concerned that the patient did not have a full understanding of their illness. The family member said, \"We know this. We are living this every day. We do not need it said again and again. We want to focus on hope.\"", "I second, third and fourth this!! I grew up in an open and honest family. My dad had cancer when I was 12. My youngest sibling was 3. They didn\u2019t know if he would make it. (He did) my parents sat us down and explained everything. Right down to Daddy could die. Was it scary? Yes. Was it hard? Yes. \n\nHowever, I really think it was better for us. The cancer is hereditary and 2 of my brothers are carriers. It\u2019s not if they get cancer, but when. I believe that our parents made that seem like not such a death sentence to them. They allowed questions, they were honest.", "Similar story with my mom. I knew she had cancer, but they didn\u2019t tell us when it got worse and she was dying until the last week of her life. Got to say a goodbye before she went unconscious and passed away. OP, don\u2019t do that to your kids", "This. I had similar instances with both parents.  Father had metastatic colon cancer.  Survived five years after diagnosis with chemo radiation and surgery.   6 months after he passed my mother was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer. Super aggressive. After 1 chemo treatment she was hospitalized and in hospice within the week.  She passed 30 days after being diagnosed.  My son was younger than your children and it was hard on him but being upfront about what was happening in a kid friendly way prepared him more for what was coming.  Also the hospice we were at with both my parents offered a summer camp for children dealing with grief.  Look into if there is something like that available in your area", "I had a friend at high school whose mother was diagnosed with an incurable cancer. She decided not to tell her daughter about it. Nothing. My friend came home one day to find her collapsed at home. She was dead the next day. It absolutely broke my friend, because not only did she suddenly loose her mother, she learnt that her mother had been lying to her for years. It was awful. Please communicate with your kids, this will be hard enough without false hope", "Seriously.  People who give up die quickly.  We're all dying, some just earlier than others.  OP shouldn't take his wife's fight away from her.  It's her choice and I can't see the downside in her fighting cancer as best she can.", "Excellent comment. Positive attitude can have an uncanny effect on illness. Just because she\u2019s (sadly) unlikely to survive doesn\u2019t mean that positivity can\u2019t extend or improve what time she has left.\n\nOP is also right to be realistic to himself and the children. Let everyone make the most of the time mom has left.\n\nDefinitely NAH.", "Agree. It's not up to OP to convince his wife that she is terminal. He may not agree with her mindset but she is the one with cancer and how she chooses to cope is her prerogative. That said it's absolutely reasonable for OP to want realistic expectations, particularly to prepare their children. NAH, illness and death are so complex and there is no right (or wrong) way to do it. But it is unlikely his wife will spend her last days wishing she was more pessimistic, only thankful for any of the time she could enjoy and fight for better days for her kids. My heart goes out to you OP if you happen to read this, praying for strength for everyone involved.", "Agree with all this. I hope OP\u2019s wife can stay positive if it helps her, but not to the detriment of giving the kids false hope. Making sure the inevitable hurt hurts least is going to help OP when he has to carry on parenting alone. \n\nGood luck, OP. Best wishes to you and yours.", "I'll agree, and vote NAH. Chronic palliative illness is not something anyone who hasn't experienced it can truly empathize with. \n\nOP, I'm sending you and your kids so much love and positivity  right now. You're doing the best you can. If you and your kids are not in therapy, especially with a therapist specializing in grief and medical trauma, you are doing yourself and your family a disservice. Love and blessings to you.", "My purpose was to identify any prognostic changes that may have occurred.  I didn\u2019t want to divulge, hence the one on one.  In hindsight I wish I would\u2019ve refused or lied to her.  I would not change the fact that I spoke with the dr tho", "I can't even imagine how tough that must have been for you at that age. My Dad hid his diagnosis from almost everyone until the very end. He was cycling for miles two weeks before I found out he had terminal cancer. By the time I found out I only had 10 days left and I still deeply regret having not had more time with him. And I was 42 so to cope with that as a teenager must have been really hard. \n\nFor OP I would say NTA. You have such a delicate balance to strike between preparing your children while allowing your wife to embrace her hope. I'm guessing she's a smart lady and knows exactly what is coming. I was diagnosed with one of the worst cancers in terms of survival rates when my daughter was 14. I was honest with her from the start with the amazing support of her Dad who was my ex but a sweetheart of a human. We guided her through it together with a delicate balance of truth and hope. I was incredibly lucky to survive and my daughter is 20 now and at University. However, there is a real chance it will return at some point and I will always be honest with her when it does. Because if time becomes limited I want to embrace the ass of it! \n\nSending you much love from an internet stranger who has been on both ends of your predicament. Whatever happens you sound like a wonderful husband and father and I'm sure you've got this. X", "NTA You guys need to tell your kids what's going on and what the time table might be. They need to have the chance to spend every chance they can with their mom. You don't want them to have a negative interaction with her and that's the last thing they ever say.", "I want to second this. In the case of my father, \"beating this\" meant one more Christmas with the family\" and not dying too close to Christmas. For some it's hanging on till the kids are out of HS. Or any number of goals that people may have. Beating this doesn't always mean they'll live their full natural life.", "Let her remain positive", "I went through death doula training a few years ago. You may be able to find one through INELDA, which is an international organization. They're growing in popularity all over the world, but are more common in cities.\n\nYour wife may be resistant because making a death plan could feel like she's acquiescing to her illness. However, if she does recover she can still use her death plan later on. It may even be beneficial for the two of you to create each of yours together."]}
