The oncologists first words were \"This is an uncurable diagnosis\" and \"The rest of your life will be palliative\". Obviously, we were upset.

After the first set of scans following initial scans there was overall reduction in tumor sizes everywhere as seen on a CT scan. Dr is concerned about another area and wanted a PET scan performed in 2 months.\n\nDuring this time I run into a buddy of mine from college who is an oncologist. I gave him the information and he told me that most likely I can count on three years, but survival is highly unlikely. Every time I asked him \"what about these success stories my wife is reading online?\" His response \"Be careful most people don't have a good handle on their diagnosis and tend to make them worse than they were\u201d (this actually happened last week a colleague reached out saying she was a stage 4 survivor, she was not stage 4).\n\nDuring this time my wife continues to remain unbelievably positive to the point that she had me convinced she was going to beat this diagnosis (Note: It's very rare that anyone beats this- I will not go into specifics because \"everyone knows someone\" and most are not comparable). She continues to consume positive stories of success and keeps telling me \"this isn't taking me out\".  Yesterday she goes for chemo and sees the doctor before the infusion begins. Prior to leaving the house I ask her if it's ok if I speak with the doctor alone. She's apprehensive and asks why. I said because I want answers to tough questions, many that she is ignoring (survival instinct?). I want answers because I feel I need to prepare my kids for her impending demise. She texts her friend for advice about this and her friend was neutral and told her it was up to her. She gave me consent to speak with the doctor alone.\n\nWe meet with the doctor prior to the infusion as usual and my wife informs the doctor that I'd like to speak to him alone. He verifies with her that this is ok and she goes on to infusion. I talk with the doctor for about 40 minutes. He is the third oncologist that has now told me that the diagnosis remains \"uncurable\" and \"palliative\". That time involved lots of information regarding blood work, kids, quality of life, etc, but the diagnosis is the important part. I leave the office and head to see my wife. She asks me what we talked about. At first I refused to tell her, and say I don't want to share. I gave her three \"are you sure?\" to which she replied yes to all. I told her she wouldn't want to hear it, but she insisted. So I told her... She replied by saying \"I refuse to accept that\".

She needs to be positive... you need to prepare your kids. Please. Please talk to them. My parents weren't forthcoming about my mother's cancer.

Don't do that to them.", "NAH - You're both trying to do the best you can to deal with a difficult situation. You're trying to keep realistic and get all of the facts, she's trying to stay positive.\n\nBear in mind that staying positive is not necessarily being stupid or ignorant - positive thinking can be a huge factor in your health, and may be a large part of what is helping your wife to get through this. If she was defeatist, she might not have lasted as long, or might have been less able to enjoy the limited time she has left.\n\nLikewise, you're right to want to be prepared with the facts - you're not only going to be with her during this difficult journey, but you're also going to need to prepare for everything that comes after, including ensuring your kids are all taking everything well enough.\n\nI think both of you are approaching this as best you can. As for telling her... well, she did ask, and kept insisting. It would have been an AH move to hide it from her at that point. However, even if you disagree with her positive outlook, you can still *support* her in her positive outlook - it's what's giving her a sense of purpose right now, so be careful not to take that from her.\n\nYou will want to make sure that affairs are in order \"just in case\", of course. But if she insists on moving forward with the mindset of \"I'm surviving this\", then let her have that.", "~~N T A~~  NAH This is her coping method. Support her fight, but prepare yourself and the kids for the future.\n\nThe truth is that none of us know when our time is up.  She has been given a hint. Celebrate and enjoy the time you have remaining.\n\nedited to fix judgement accuracy.", "I'm going to have to go with NAH.   \nOP, I think you are smart to get the real real from her doc - you have kids and a shared life, and you should know what you need to prepare for.  Your wife asked to hear what you learned, you gave her a few opps to not hear it, and she opted to hear it.  From what it sounds like, you just told her what you learned, and didn't share any opinions of yours.  That's not an AH move.\n\nBut your wife certainly isn't an AH for wanting to be positive. As a mom myself, it would take me a really, really, really long time to come to terms with the thought of leaving my kids. I'm getting emotional just thinking about it now. The bombshell diagnosis and the aggressive treatment has undoubtedly been really hard for her.  Let her be positive - it may be all she has.\n\nI'm sorry you're having to deal with this - sending good vibes to all of you.", "NAH.  She is the one dying so I'm not going to judge her for her misplaced optimism.  However you absolutely need to have a realistic outlook on this, because you are the one who will have to carry on after she passes and pick up the pieces.  It isn't fair for you to have to pretend everything is going to be ok up until the point where her condition is so bad she has to accept reality.", "NAH. She is capable of making choices and she wanted the information.\n\nMy thoughts are that as long as she is not making irrational choices based on her optimism (refusing to make a will, planning activities that will cause her harm) let her be optimistic. From your post it sounds like you are doing this and just needed a realistic perspective for your own benefit.\n\nIf hope helps her manage then let her have all the hope. But you didn\u2019t want to lie to your partner when she demanded the information.", "Given the multiple assurances and reassurances that your wife wanted to know what the doctor said, you acted rationally and understandably. Situations like this are difficult for all parties involved, and you seem to be trying your best considering everything. Definitely not the asshole", "NAH - I\u2019m sorry for what your wife and your family are going through and there\u2019s really not going to be an answer on what you should or shouldnt be doing I feel. \n\nIf I were you I would recommend you and your wife speak to a therapist about this - this may help your wife come to terms with her diagnosis and help you learn ways to speak to her (and your children) about it.", "I am overjoyed any time someone beats the odds at cancer, but that is so rare. There are practical concerns to deal with here too. I am glad your wife is so positive, but if 3 oncologists have told you both this is palliative care, you need to inform your kids and get them ready about the possibly limited time their mom has with them. You and your wife need to plan her bequests and write a will, decide on medical power of attorney, end of life hospice care, etc. If amazing things happen, you won't need to worry about these issues any more. But otherwise, doing the legal paperwork while being overwhelmed with grief is the worst thing in the universe. NAH. Wishing you and your wife all the strength.", "NTA and I say that as someone who is on chemo, with a terminal diagnosis. Her being positive is imperative to her outcomes (and I use the plural as there are many separate issues/events involved with a terminal diagnosis), but your sharing the truth (again) with her does not qualify as TA behavior. At some point, she will decide to either accept or not accept her diagnosis, but regardless of her choice, you being aware of what to expect is important, and will help you and your children deal with your wife\u2019s end of life.", "NAH but I think you could have handled it better.\n\nMy second wife passed after an eight-year battle with breast cancer.  At diagnosis her oncodoc gave her 18 months and like I said, she hung on for eight years.\n\nI went the same route you did, trying to face the hard truth that she was gonna die sooner rather than later.  Her dad who was a doc told me that what she really needed right now was a positive attitude and that it was my role to help her maintain that.\n\nHe was not wrong.\n\nBut - I get it.  A terminal cancer diagnosis is devastating news and everyone reacts to devastation differently.  But - if she wants to stay positive and believe she can beat the thing (and it is possible she can) then IMO you really need to support that.  She's doing what she needs to keep going - and right now reality isn't particularly helpful.  There will be plenty of time to get real if things do progress.\n\nWarm thoughts to your whole family -", "NAH - You shared information after she said yes after three inquiries.\n\nYou wife has the right to be hopeful no matter the information provided. I think this is where you are stuck. You have difficulty watching her have hope. You are married but this does not imply you need to view things the same. Best to you. This is a cruel and heartless disease. Be good to yourself.", "NAH, she needs to fight this her way, and you need to prepare for after. I do worry that her optimism will prevent her from making memories and doing things like video journals for the kids.", "NAH\n\nShe did ask you what you had talked about with the doctor. I think if she hadn\u2019t asked, you shouldn\u2019t have told her, but since she kept asking it\u2019s another story. \nI get wanting to prepare your kids. That maybe could have been a conversation you had with your kids about the real state of your wife, and she could have kept her positive outlook. You really need that sometimes in her position. I get that from the outside and as the other person it\u2019s really painful, but sometimes she needs that. \n\nI don\u2019t think you did anything wrong by telling her after she asked so many times. It\u2019s a tricky situation.", "NTA but allow her to cope.", "NTA\n\nYou told her what the medical professionals say.  She chooses not to accept it.\n\nIt's entirely possible (though unlikely) that she will beat this thing.\n\nYour children are aware of her diagnosis and treatment.  \n\nWhen (if) the treatments stop working will be the time to have a serious discussion with your children.\n\nHugs and Prayers to your wife, children and you", "NAH this is so sad I'm really sorry. You can't possibly think she could be TA for being in denial about dying. She doesn't want to leave you & her babies. I'm so sorry OP. I have no suggestions other than try to love on her as much as you can & look into getting a therapist now before shes gone. Having a professional to help you get through this could be a wonderful tool to help keep her passing as.... positive for lack of a better term... As possible. Ugh my heart hurts so bad for you guys.

I think it\u2019s reasonable and honestly responsible to prepare for the worst and to be realistic. It\u2019s smart to have a plan, but at the same time it\u2019s a bit harsh. I can see how she may feel you are giving up on her, even if your intentions are to keep your kids best interest though. I know you asked for her permission to talk with her doctor in private, but given the subject matter, she may also see it as deceitful. I totally get your intention, so I can\u2019t bring myself to fully label you AH. I think her feelings just need to be considered as much as the facts on this one.\n\nYou seem to be trying your very best to navigate this difficult situation, which is admirable. You clearly care so much about everyone involved, and I think that\u2019s the most important part.", "NAH. I think it's right that you get the hard facts as it'll be you having to pick up the pieces after she's gone. She said she wanted the facts, you gave her three opportunities to change her mind, but she's in denial about her reality. That may change as the end gets closer, but if she wants to ignore the truth so she doesn't dwell on reality can you blame her?", "NAH. We often find ourselves in echo chambers on the internet. Your wife has found lots of beating the odds success stories. Other people will have the opposite experience and only read about the tragic deaths. Your wife is fighting for her life, and while she is probably not going to beat it, having a positive attitude could make the rest of her time more pleasant. I would have recommended talking to the doctor with your wife instead of alone, as it\u2019s her life and she deserves all the information. If she hears it directly from the doctor\u2019s mouth, it might carry more weight. I wish you the best.", "NAH, this is devastating for you and your family. You and your wife are dealing with it quite differently. It\u2019s admirable that she wants to fight this, and equally admirable that you want information that will help prepare you and your kids for what\u2019s to come.", "INFO did you think the doctor was saying anything to you that he hadn't told her?", "NAH - I am sorry you two have to deal with this. Now that you spoke directly with the dr, I would drop it, let her be optimistic. But you can make the necessary plans", "NAH it sucks all around. My dad did not want to believe he would die despite the fact gleioblastomas are 100% fatal and incurable. He kept denying it till he slipped into a coma. But I guess when your facing your own mortality you have to cope somehow. It really sucked when he kept telling everyone he would make it, and those that did not know it hurt them a lot when they found out he died. Sometimes that optimism can go a bit far. So try to stay realistic and support your wife however you can. Death sucks, no one really wants to ever accept that.", "NTA, my dad died on glioblastoma a little over two years ago. When he got diagnosed we thought be'd do well since he had stopped drinking, was exercising and overall healthy. They gave him 12-14 months but we figured that was just an estimate and heard plenty of stories about the miracle cases where they lived 10 years from their initial diagnosis. The first surgery went better than expected and he did pretty well for sometime so we got optimistic, but after the second surgery he really started to decline and probably around the year and a half mark he took a steep decline and passed away about 21 months after his diagnosis. Still you want to stay positive just not at the expense of avoiding dealing with the hard stuff, make sure she tells your kids everything she wants them to hear because by the time the end is near she may not be able to.", "Aww man NAH, she needs to hope and you need to be the rock based in reality for your kids. Just keep standing by her side, not sure if you're religious but I'll pray for your family tonight.", "NAH. \n\nI am sorry you're dealing with this, she's trying to cope and facing mortality is a huge thing, especially as your children are on the cusp of adulthood - she's trying hard to keep it together and hold onto a future she's planned for decades. My parent did the same and I was also in denial, right up to the death. Don't push it, focus on your time together and supporting your kids/yourself. \n\nThe road ahead is hard, when the decline comes - she may naturally accept it as she begins to feel more and more tired but there's no need to rush it right now. The important thing is gently broaching the topics of wills/final wishes and practically, I'd recommend getting samples of tangible memories for when she's gone, her handwriting, videos and audio of her voice as you all spend time together - it will be invaluable later on.", "Professional death doulas are a thing.

I am so sorry that this awful thing has happened to both of you.", "NTA for answering her honestly, but she clearly wants to fight like hell, and she can refuse to accept that if she wants. From here on out, you need to support her in whatever way she chooses to deal with this. That includes NOT divulging the doctor's POV with your kids.

And I\u2019m not saying your wife CAN cure herself. However, chemo is a hard thing to go through.

What do you win by being right?", "I'd say YTA, sure she wanted the information but that sort of news can crush someone even if they don't tell you outright or seem fine. Sure a lot of doctors will say she won't make it out but miracles do happen and a positive mindset makes a lot of difference, whereas negativity and stress has been shown to have a detrimental effect on recovery, the immune system etc.\n\nYou should stay positive and supportive for your wife not get her down or throw all that negativity on her. Do you think she isn't aware of that? That she isn't putting a brave face on just for you and the kids? Miracles can happen and they do, don't think that unlikely means she 100% won't make it because nothing is 100% certain and even small chances or 1% is still a chance.\n\nIt's good to be prepared but don't let it consume you and overall don't make it consume or let it consume your wife.

Personally, I'd have told the kids the details of the diagnosis but also told them that mom is positive and fighting as hard as she can, but the reality is that we are going to lose her, maybe soon, maybe in 3 years.

She remained positive until the very last minute like she literally had an infusion done the day before she passed, oxygen tank and all. \n\nNAH. You have to be realistic for your family and she has to hold on to her optimism. IMO, it is harder when the sick person loses hope where they give up on treatments and such. She asked you and you told her honestly. In a way, I think she knows, but she needs to remain positive or else she loses that hope and that could be a scary thing.", "NAH. I\u2019m so sorry your family is going through this. \n\nIt\u2019s important that you are aware of the odds and can begin to prepare yourself and your children. You need to do that.

It\u2019s your life and your wife\u2019s life. Your wife asked you a question, you answered it and she disagrees. I\u2019m not sure (from your post) if she still disagrees, but nevertheless \u2014 as a married couple \u2014 you each are entitled to your own opinions and your own disagreements. \n\nTake care of yourself friend.

It\u2019s like the stages of grief.  Your wife can\u2019t believe it because she just can\u2019t.  Her mind shies away from it now.  It is good for her to have hope, but she should address the odds and make plans.  Even if you have to tell her \u201cjust in case\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s about time we both did this\u201d because it\u2019s true, you could be hit by a car tomorrow.", "NAH this is such an hard situation to be in.

My heat goes out to you and your family", "NAH although I will admit it's probably better for her to stay positive, I've heard it can go a long way but not really sure if there's anything scientific.

I wish I had a better answer.\n\nI'm so sorry OP, that you're going through this as a family, and that she's going through this. I find it awfully courageous of her to stay so positive even when facing something bleek.\n\nMy only advice? Apologize and support her. Now isn't the time to stand firn. You've said what you've needed to, you've planted that seed. She knows deep down and when the time comes hopefully she'll come to terms with it if that's really what'll happen.

That\u2019s ok and you\u2019re not an AH for doing that. Now continue to honor her request by respecting her right to cling to hope. It\u2019s her right to choose that, too. \n\nDo be honest with the kids. Explain that her diagnosis is terminal, but that it\u2019s ok to celebrate her life now, while she lives. Do NOT allow your house to become a funeral parlor. When the kids need to talk, really listen. Ask a grief counselor how you can best help them right now and in the near future.

I called them one day to come \u201ckidnap\u201d Dad and get him out of the house for an hour or two. Dad was reluctant to go, but Mom was stable so I essentially pushed him out. When he came back he was greatly refreshed. I made sure I did that with my friends or my sister. YOU make time for yourself, too. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry your family is dealing with this.

I think both of you are doing the right thing. You should be preparing for the worst because you'll be the one left but she should remain positive and optimistic. I'm certainly no expert but I can imagine staying positive probably results in a better quality of life than if she's all doom and gloom and sure she's about to die. Additionally, even though it sounds woo woo and I hate that shit, I've definitely read that being positive can have positive effects. No idea if it's real, but it can't hurt. If being hopeful is what she needs right now, then let her have that.", "NAH. You confirmed with her, asking several times if she was sure she wanted to know.", "NAH.

They were in their early 20s. \n\nI didn't think it was right. My sister was unable to speak so I decided to tell them the truth. My mom was angry. It was so hard but I don't regret my decision. My sister's kids were glad I told them. I know it was what my sister would have wanted.\n\nIt's much better to avoid the kind of shock and resentment that can come from pretending things will be fine. There's already enough shock involved with terminal health conditions.\n\nAgain, I'm so sorry.

Hope is one thing but denial is another.", "My FIL died a few years ago very suddenly. My husband and his brother were in their 50s, they were both devastated and also furious that the cancer had been there for years but no one noticed. Long story short he had been under an oncologist for years and had decided not to \"worry the boys\". That is to say: it is fine for your wife to be upbeat and positive she has to deal with now but you have to live with the aftermath and not preparing your children would be very wrong. Telling her what he said is not wrong she asked you answered and none of it was news to her. NTA and I am sorry this is happening to you.", "NAH, you did the right thing in preparing yourself for the worst, but if she gives up and believes it then she'll give up a lot more than just her hope. Let her believe in a bright future while she handles this, and be there for her and your kids. Be ready, but don't crush hope.", "NAH. That\u2019s what she needs, this is what you need. Be positive and supportive without feeding bullshit, which is hard.

Maybe she needs to remain positive to have quality of life for what time she has left, and it could even extend her time, just by virtue of the fact that staring down death is stressful and stress affects health negatively. I understand you need to prepare your kids though and make plans.", "NTA...as shitty as this situation is....there is a difference between being positive and being delusional. She can plan for the worst while hoping for the best and still prepare her kids for what will happen. I understand her fear tho and honestly a lot of ppl think if you don't address it or think about it it will magically go away. I've also heard a lot if Dr's refuse to give terminal patients timeliness bc it's almost like a self fulfilling prophecy and hope is a very powerful emotion. Very hard situation all around.", "My husband was diagnosed with a stage 4 cancer that, although not curable, was supposed to be manageable, the possibility of remission, etc. So we avoided anything but positive talk. 2 months, he died from a rare complication. In our fear and avoidance, we did not have the big talks or make any preparations. Huge mistake. Support her any way you can, but  please have the big talks. ( her wishes for after she dies, finances,how much end life support she wants or doesn't want, etc)  Maybe as reality sets in she will be able to do so. \n\nI am so sorry. For her, your kids, you.

So you want her to give up fighting? I mean if there's no chance of survival why fight? You're the worst partner for someone going through this. \n\nYou should be prepared for her passing, but your insistence she accept it are beyond the pale. She's not using the fact that there are survivors to quit treatment, on the contrary, she's using it to motivate her. Stop being a roadblock to her. \n\nI don't think your an AH for preparing for the worst possible outcome, and watching someone I love die from cancer is the worst thing I've ever been through, you need to be as supportive to your wife as possible. Indulge her in thinking she's going to make. It makes her stronger. It makes her fight harder.", "NTA. You took the extra step to speak to the doctor in private because you knew she was trying to stay positive and  then you relented when she pushed you for the information. I can't imagine how difficult this situation is for both of you. Having hope is probably what keeps her going day to day. It sounds like you are doing your best to support her and allow her to have extreme hope even though you don't (and of course it's ok that you don't). Just keep supporting her and being there for her.", "Agreed, lost my mum 6 weeks shy of 11.\n\nI would also like to add that when the time comes, don't delay telling them she is gone.

By the time I got there that night, he was already loosing consciousness and unable to speak. He never regained consciousness, and he died 48 hours later. The last time I had actually had a good, face-to-face, real conversation with him was 2 weeks prior when I was down visiting him for a few days\u2026\n\nI have a strong suspicion that he was trying to protect us from the truth, or maybe he had to try to convince himself he would survive.", ">you need to inform your kids and get them ready about the possibly limited time their mom has with them\n\nI agree with everything you said, but wanted to highlight this in particular. OP, speaking from personal experience, your kids are old enough that it can make a big difference for them if your wife has conversations with them with the understanding that the horrible part might come sooner rather than later or tries to keep a super upbeat face on things. \n\nI would absolutely never fault someone for hoping for the best till the end, but I would really encourage you both to have conversations with the kids along the lines of 'mom is tolerating her treatments really well and we still have hope, but the odds aren't in her favor' and let them have some of those bigger conversations if it feels right. \n\nI lost a parent to cancer when I was very young and the line between 'still optimistic so we're not going to get into this' and being too ill and medicated to have real conversations can be very, very thin. \n\nHaving a conversation with the kids about what she wants them to (metaphorically) take with them as they grow up, lessons she wants them remember, things about her childhood or theirs that she thinks are important, etc. I can't imagine how difficult these conversations would be for your wife, but having been the kid in this situation I also cannot tell you how much I wish I'd been able to have these conversations with my parent before they passed.", "I'm very sorry to hear about your wife's situation.  It's very, very difficult and I feel there are no right answers here.\n\nRecently went through something similar with my mother - not cancer, but terminal. She did not accept her circumstances well either for her own mental health or for us kids, I don't know. That's OK, it's her decision - but ignoring her prognosis made her quality of life much worse and prolonged her suffering.\n\nMy personal view based on what your have said is that your wife is not doing that - she is getting treatment and making clear headed decisions about her care. It won't change her prognosis, but maybe her keeping some of that unrealistic optimism while still getting treatment, preparing for end of life issues, etc will help her maintain her quality of life longer. \n\nI wish you and your family peace.", ">> YTA simply because palliative care only will never involve chemo.

She had many \"She shouldn't have survived\" moments. I mentally prepared myself for her passing, but in the daily, I made sure she had a fun, fulfilled life.

She had the most positive attitude of anyone I\u2019ve ever met. She was a single mom of a 6 yr old, and she knew exactly what she was fighting for \u2014 time. \n\nWhen she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, she specifically didn\u2019t want to know how long the doctors thought she had. She knew she was terminal \u2014 pancan is nearly universally fatal. But a year later, after nearly 30 rounds of chemo, further testing showed that the slim chance she had for a surgery that might extend her life further wasn\u2019t possible. At that point, she asked the doctors how long they thought she had had when she was first diagnosed. They said maybe six months. \n\nShe died 19 months after her initial diagnosis. That extra year was everything. She got an extra year to make memories with her son. He was 4 when she was diagnosed, and it\u2019s less likely he would have had strong memories of her. She got to see him through all of kindergarten and half of grade 1. They got to go on an incredible road trip together, before she got too sick to walk.

About two and a half years into my dads diagnoses my grandma had gotten home to find her husband dead. my grandma is a travel nurse and he\u2019s retired, she worked one week on one week off so she was coming home from her week in a different state and he was gone. none of us even knew he was sick. his autopsy revealed he had stage four hepatocellular carcinoma. we assume he didn\u2019t tell my grandma because he felt her worrying about her son (he\u2019s my dads step dad) was already enough and she didn\u2019t need to worry about both of the men in her life having cancer. he passed away at the very beginning of the pandemic and it left our family pretty distraught", "\u2764\ufe0f", "I'm in tears reading this. RIP to your young friend.", "An important part of informed consent (especially for something like cancer) is to lay out the options, with recommendations, and let the patient choose. And once the patient has chosen, the doctor can remind or recommend different options if asked, when things change, or just when checking in, but they're not supposed to try to change the patient's mind (they can say that's against medical/my advice of course. But ultimately the decision of what to do is the patient's.) \n\nBad doctors exist, and they'll all human. But oncologists in particular have those kinds of conversations very frequently and the patient should be made well aware of the risks of chemotherapy before beginning treatment and then periodically during treatment. If your father gave informed consent to the treatment and wasn't open to rediscussing the issues, it's not the doctor's place to change his mind. The only thing the doctor can do is stop treatment if it becomes contraindicated (that can be both really clear and really complex with chemotherapy.)"]}
