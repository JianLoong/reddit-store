My own stimming makes me feel that way sometimes, too (especially when bouncing my leg at school caused it to bang on the underside of a metal desk).  It eventually got better for me, especially after I found my calling (computer programming).  I hope you find your calling, and it gets better for you.  You are not alone.\n\nBTW, I wholeheartedly approve your choice of music to hum.  It's definitely one of my all time favorites.", "NTA the vaccination thing was proved to utterly BS.  Stimming when uncomfortable is perfectly fine and you shouldn't feel like you have to mask for someone who is family.  You sound like you were self managing really well for the situation and your aunt is a massive ahole that should be cut out from your life.   Don't let her negative ill informed BS get in your head, she is listening to ideas thet are proved wrong.  You are autistic, your mind is wired in a different way and while it can make it hard living in a nurotypical world nurodivergent minds have solved some of the world's great problems and puzzles because we think differently.  There are some great videos on facebook, tiktok, and YouTube my autistic husband found them really helpful, also TED talks led by some of our top, autistic, STEM people if you ever question that.", "Dum da dum dum, da da dum!", "NTA Indy. Sorry I had to throw in the nickname because I LOVE Indiana Jones (I wanted to be an archeologist be just like him lol). I worked as a pediatric nurse for years and while there is so much debate over vaccinations, regardless your mother is not to blame and you are not to blame for your nervous reactions. I would be nervous around your nasty aunt. She is delusional and abusive. Your mother needs to realize how to is she really is and both of you do not need her in your life until she gets treatment (sadly, that won\u2019t happen). I know it\u2019s tough to cut out a sibling/aunt but her treatment of you is inexcusable.  You are almost a legal adult and if your mother continues a relationship with her sister, doesn\u2019t mean you have to. The smarta$$ in me would love for you to get an Indiana Jones hat and wear it if you have to be around her again and when she complains, tell her you\u2019ll have the whip next time if she doesn\u2019 t hush about it lol! The world is a better place with you in it and never let your aunt make you feel you\u2019re not!", "NTA. I despised your aunt after the 4th sentence. She is plain awful. Indeed, any family who allows her into the same room as you is AH.  This is the clearest case for NC i have read in weeks, like restraining order level NC.  You did nothing wrong.  \nYou did nothing wrong.\nYou did nothing wrong.", "NTA, I can\u2019t believe she made you feel so bad after how in the wrong SHE clearly is. It\u2019s actually making my stomach sick just thinking out it. My best friend and girlfriend are both on the autism spectrum and just thinking about  someone treating an autistic person that way is borderline horror-inducing.\n\nShe\u2019s treating you, A CHILD, like a dog she\u2019s disgusted with and her behaviour is absolutely abhorrent and should in no way be tolerated. Some people use the r-word as a joke, my brother included, but anyone who uses it SERIOUSLY absolutely deserves to get chastised so hard it makes their head spin.\n\nNot to mention her sickening behaviour of telling you you should be aborted and calling you names, if there is a hell that woman is getting kicked straight down.", "There are people who cannot be civilised with because they are *not* civilised, your aunt is absolutely one of those people."]}
