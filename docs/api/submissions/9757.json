We stopped at a raising canines because my mom wanted some for dinner, and my aunt wouldn\u2019t stop staring at me. She made fun of how I ate.

She said my mom should have tried again after the first abortion failed and everyone was staring it seemed it was so freaking embarrassing. My mom told me to come on and go to the car, and my aunt started saying that she needed a ride home, and her boyfriend was at work and couldn\u2019t pick her up. My mom told her tough luck, and we left, but idk. \n\nI feel like a jerk. Idk why. I feel like maybe I should have just pretended to be normal while she was around. Like I know i can make people uncomfortable but I didn\u2019t think I was being that weird. It\u2019s freaking Indiana jones, who cares???\n\nI guess I just need some help righting this in my head.
