I was staying at the salvation army and she opened up her guest room to me for a few hundred a month.  This was supposed to be a month or so long arrangement but life got hectic.  This house has two bathrooms.  One is completely functional and modern.  The other one is not functional and needs remodeled.  I mean, the shower and toilet don't even work.  The sink works but no one ever uses it.  My former friend, I will call her FF, owns the house.  She has been saying for years she is trying to save the money to fix everything in that bathroom and it hasn't gotten done yet.  So last year I stopped paying rent except for when she hounds me about it and then I give her a little money to shut her up.  I'm sick of living in this house where I can't take a bath and have only a standup shower and don't have my own bathroom.\n\nIn the last 12 months she has gotten 3 tattoos and she went on a cross country road trip with her brother.  When I call her out on this stuff she just makes excuses like, \"It's gonna cost about 3 grand to do that bathroom.  I'm trying to save up the money but there are other bills and stuff that are just a higher priority.\"  She has about $500 in the bathroom fund right now.  Yesterday she even had the audacity to blame me and say maybe if I paid rent she would have more money for the bathroom remodel.  She said I make more money than she does and it's ridiculous that she's supporting me.  She also sent some sappy text about how this is really hurting her a lot because 20 years of friendship are basically ruined and all she did was try to help me.  Whatever.\n\nWell I think it's ridiculous that I can't even take a bubble bath while paying to live here but she can get tats and go on cross country trips.  Over the summer she told me she couldn't afford to turn the AC on either unless I start contributing more.  She said the AC raises the electric bill by $50 a month and she needs me to help if I want it on.   I'm sick of being denied basic comforts while she can get tats and go on trips. Oh and as of today (Halloween) she is posting all over social media about going to work at some big tattoo convention in 2023 and possibly going to Germany with her SO who is from there.  SMH...  Just wow.  \n\nSo am I the asshole?   If anyone is wondering I am 40 and she is 43.  We live somewhere where the cost of living is pretty high if anyone is question why 2 grown women are living together.", "created_utc": 1667167660, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhrgyu/aita_for_not_paying_rent_when_being_denied_basic/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're a leech, she doesn't owe you anything except a boot in your ass.", "No. Only things landlord is required to provide is access to a bathroom where you can close the door for privacy, heat in the winter, electricity/gas, and access to a kitchen sink. Anything else is extra.

SHe is 43.  I have never lived on my own completely.  I moved from my parents place in with a bf, then with a friend for a while.  Then another bf for ten years, and then here.", "I mean you should consider having something of your own before you whine about what people aren\u2019t doing for you. It\u2019s kind of pathetic.", "That\u2019s a great idea. Why don\u2019t YOU contribute something and pay for the remodel for the bathroom YOU want to use?
