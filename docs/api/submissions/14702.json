You banned her for not respecting rules in your house, namely not talking about sex work in front of kids.", "NTA. You didn't ban her because of her job, you banned her because she won't stop making vulgar remarks and you don't want that behavior in your home. \n\nLots of professions have morally ambiguous aspects, and anyone who enjoys talking about how dumb people are, or who brags about ruining lives through their work is not an enjoyable person to hang out with, especially if you have young kids around.", "Wow. Not condemning sex work at all, but your sister needs to be able to \u2018read the room\u2019- if people are uncomfortable with the conversation, the initiator of the conversation needs to change topics.

If she was a  baker and hearing about cupcakes bothered you this much, of course you are allowed to say no cupcake talk in your home. Its your home. Even if we decided you are wrong, unreasonable, rude, etc on your opinion, the one place you get to have your opinion over everyone's else is in your home and its kinda weird for your sister, family, friends to insist otherwise.", "NTA...You're not really banning her because of her job, you're banning her because of her inappropriate conversations around children. You told her the rules and she chose not to follow them.", "NTA- you're not banning her because of the job, you're banning her because she's ignored your request to stop talking about it in your home.

I especially hate it happens when nobody asked for this information.\n\nI'm 100% certain you did not ask your sister about the topic. Why would you? I have a sister and I can die happy not knowing anything about that side of her life.\n\nI'll even hit you with another angle that makes this wrong. Everyone else talked about the kids, but think of your wife. If she hears about this, I bet it'd give her the fear that you could be untrustworthy later on. She doesn't need that in her life.\n\nYour sister sounds like a disgusting person, not because she's a sex worker - but because she enjoys doing this stuff with married men and gets a weird ego boost that they'd rather be doing things with her than their own wives. That is fucked up.", "NTA\n\nLeaving sex work aside, there are some jobs that just don't make a good topic for casual conversation.

She hasn't stopped.  I'd make it clear that you love her and enjoy her company, and that she's welcome back if she will abide by your rules.

I know what I do is still considered that, but I don't feel as though that defines me.  I don't talk to any family or close friends about anything I do, not because I am embarrassed by it, but I know they wouldn't understand or approve of it.

You banned her for not being willing to stop talking about a subject you didn't want discussed in your house. \n\nWell, she has the right to talk about anything she wants, but she doesn't have the right to be in your house while she's doing it.

Go you!", "INFO: when you say it's \"not an OK thing to do\" do you mean sex work in general? Or specifically taking gratification from knowing that men are cheating on their wives with you?\n\nIf the former ESH, sex work is real work, that doesn't excuse your sister's crass behavior and stepping on your boundaries of appropriate topics, but it's going way too far to say you need to raise your kids to look down on and not have respect for anyone who does sex work whether out of necessity or simply because it's work they like doing.\n\nIf the latter NTA, your sister's behavior is pretty shitty, not because it's sex work but because she gets gratification from and brags about knowing other people are having relationship issues that she's involved in. Which I guess in itself is kinda her business but that she insists on bragging about it to you when you ask her not to is way over the line.", "Actually. Why she chose the job?\nWhat made her turn to do that job?", "It's understandable that you don't want your children to be exposed to certain topics or behaviors, especially when it comes to sex work. However, banning your sister from your home may not have been the most effective way to address the issue. You should communicate with your sister in a calm and respectful manner one more time. Go through the pro and cons, because loosing a relationship like that can be really painful. \n\nNext, Consider why your sister is behaving like that it may be possible she is struggling and jealous of your life and talking about her job is a coping mechanism. \n\nOverall, it's important to approach the situation with empathy  while also setting boundaries to protect  your family. It's possible to address the issue without going to a complete ban, and finding a solution that is the best for both people so currently.

It's about not denigrating and othering people for engaging in the world's oldest profession.\n\nThough I have to say the full on making some shit up about how this is specifically and only targeted at teenagers for pedophilic reasons is a nice disgusting and insane lie for a cherry on top.\n\nNothing is helped in society by villainizing camgirls and other sex workers.", "Because I have dignity.", "That's tragic, I wish we could make it the world's oldest former profession.", "Yay there's two of us lol. I think everyone believes they are being kind and accepting. I don't think it's loving and honest to pretend it's empowering and fun for women to be sex workers. Maybe a single mom started an Only Fans to avoid homelessness or get away from an abusive ex. No one is going to blame a desperate woman for doing what she has to do to survive, but why are we cheering it on and allowing it to continue as a society? Don't pay for OF, pay someone to clean your house or run errands or whatever. Are we prepared for a generation of children raised by proud sex workers? Sure it's the world's oldest profession but it was always one of great shame in the past. You'd never encourage your children to go down this path, you'd forbid it!! You'd tell them how horrible it was and you only did it because you'd starve otherwise, etc. You'd tell them to stay in school and do literally anything else even if you don't make nearly as much money because you'll keep your dignity and self respect and you can be proud of yourself and your job/career and have children and hope they follow in your footsteps.\n\nBut not now.

Of course I understand if someone is desperate and has to feed their children etc. But I would never encourage my children to go into sex work. I'd always encourage them to get a good education and a good job so that they don't have to stress or worry about money.\n\nWhy should we be happy for women that sell their bodies to make money (unless they are desperate though even then other ways and other methods of helping should be encouraged). Women keep arguing that they don't want to be seen as objects yet that is literally what sex work is, selling your body like an object to the pleasure of other people. It increases sex trafficking and a lot of women are forced by others to do it and have no means of escape. Even if they do join sex work, it is easy for others to take advantage of them or for the people above to take advantage of them. I would never wish that upon any woman or my children, by praising it and accepting it we are making it easier for all the above things to happen. We need to start protecting women properly not encouraging things that do the opposite.", "Totally, and this seems like an example of the world going a bit crazy.

What's dangerous is doing it in places where it's illegal so you have to do it in dark allies or under the protection of a pimp.

Every single one of those friends, including myself, has had unspeakable experiences because of this lifestyle.\n\nThat's really a shame. Perhaps if there was less stigma around sex work spread around by idiots and liars who want to control women and instead it was something we had frank and honest discussions about it that didn't describe it as a bad thing that was inherently harmful and shameful but instead just a thing some people choose to do you and your friends would've had a healthier understanding of what sex work is and how to do it safely and how to avoid being unsafe. Like, for instance, can't imagine that strip club had good safety standards in place based on this story, and it sounds like you and your friends weren't equipped to even know what to look out for. And the fault of that is because of the stigma around sex work that would've made it too shameful to even ask for advice.\n\n> It\u2019s not cool, it\u2019s not empowering,\n\nIt can be empowering. Lots of people find it empowering. Are you claiming every single person who says they find it empowering is lying?
