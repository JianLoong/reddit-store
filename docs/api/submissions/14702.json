I have no issues with sex workers but this is a situation where no talking about it is understandable at their ages.  She broke the rule.", "NTA.\n\nYou did not ban her for sex work. You banned her for not respecting rules in your house, namely not talking about sex work in front of kids.", "NTA. You didn't ban her because of her job, you banned her because she won't stop making vulgar remarks and you don't want that behavior in your home. \n\nLots of professions have morally ambiguous aspects, and anyone who enjoys talking about how dumb people are, or who brags about ruining lives through their work is not an enjoyable person to hang out with, especially if you have young kids around.", "Wow. Not condemning sex work at all, but your sister needs to be able to \u2018read the room\u2019- if people are uncomfortable with the conversation, the initiator of the conversation needs to change topics. Especially if this topic is being brought up around an adoption case worker or children. \n\nAll sister has to do is not mention this topic, at your request. NTA", "NTA, as long as the door is always open if she agrees to stop.  And honestly, your sister sounds like she's got some insecurities to work through.  That kind of talk comes from a place of poor self image, where someone is trying to build themself up.", "NTA. Your house, your rules. If she was a  baker and hearing about cupcakes bothered you this much, of course you are allowed to say no cupcake talk in your home. Its your home. Even if we decided you are wrong, unreasonable, rude, etc on your opinion, the one place you get to have your opinion over everyone's else is in your home and its kinda weird for your sister, family, friends to insist otherwise.", "NTA...You're not really banning her because of her job, you're banning her because of her inappropriate conversations around children. You told her the rules and she chose not to follow them.", "NTA- you're not banning her because of the job, you're banning her because she's ignored your request to stop talking about it in your home. If people can't follow with your specific home expectations then of course they're no longer going to be invited over, simple as that", "NTA - it\u2019s your house and she is not entitled to be there. If you think she creates an inappropriate environment for your children you don\u2019t have to have her around. \nYou gave her the option to keep coming if she doesn\u2019t bring up the subject, which refused. It\u2019s not her home and she does not make the rules.", "NTA\n\nYou are within your right to set rules and boundaries in your own home. Some rules and boundaries can be silly, but this is not one of those.\n\nI don't really like it when someone tells me all the grimey details of their sex life. I especially hate it happens when nobody asked for this information.\n\nI'm 100% certain you did not ask your sister about the topic. Why would you? I have a sister and I can die happy not knowing anything about that side of her life.\n\nI'll even hit you with another angle that makes this wrong. Everyone else talked about the kids, but think of your wife. If she hears about this, I bet it'd give her the fear that you could be untrustworthy later on. She doesn't need that in her life.\n\nYour sister sounds like a disgusting person, not because she's a sex worker - but because she enjoys doing this stuff with married men and gets a weird ego boost that they'd rather be doing things with her than their own wives. That is fucked up.", "NTA\n\nLeaving sex work aside, there are some jobs that just don't make a good topic for casual conversation. Like a doctor, a butcher or a corpse embalmer. \n\nMoreover, a way your sister speaks about other people, is rude and disgusting. And it would be rude and disgusting even if she worked at a bank, Target or Disneyland.", "NTA. Her sex worker job is her business, but it is not an appropriate topic of conversation around small children.", "Your house your rules pretty simple", "NTA. You drew a clear boundary about what was appropriate talk around your children, and your sister broke the boundary. If you can't follow the rules of the house, you can't come to the house. It's really that simple.", "NTA\n\nYou set a boundary, properly with an enforceable consequence, and she failed to adhere to the boundary and is therefor subject to the consequences. This is how it works. Brava!", "NTA. You weren\u2019t even asking her to stop doing her job, you were just asking her to stop talking about her job. That\u2019s a very reasonable request", "NTA.  You didn't ban her because of her job, you banned her because she won't shut up about screwing married men.  It would be exactly the same situation if it was a hobby of hers, not her profession.", "NTA, we have a pretty strong \"no shop talk\" rule in my house. Leave it at work. \n\nAs for your sister, if you want here back in your life, maybe make it a temporary ban? She should know you are serious now. \n\nAnd just in general \"hints\" are not a great way to tell someone not to do something, be direct.", "NTA as a parent you have the right to choose what you expose your young kids to.", "NTA.\n\nIf someone is not going to respect your parenting boundaries in your own home, they should not be welcomed.\n\nTake smoking. If you do not smoke in your home (or smoke at all), having someone light one up in your house is beyond rude, particularly if they continue to do it after you insist they stop.\n\nSame thing applies here.", "There is a time and a place to boast about how you have those poor women fooled, (her John\u2019s wives)\u2026and family gatherings, and certainly not in front of children are *not those places*. \n\nThe time for \u201chinting\u201d it is inappropriate is long past. She and her little flying monkeys can stuff it. it. Concentrate on your growing family. NTA", "NTA. It's your home, you asked her to respect your wishes while inside your home and not discuss her night job. She didn't respect your wishes and therefore don't want her over since she can't respect your rules regarding being inside YOUR own personal space.\n\nIf you had banned her because of what she did despite her following all your \"rules\" inside your home...you would be the AH.....but since you asked first and reacted towards her non-compliance....its fair. \n\nNTA", "NTA - Pretty sure she is justifying her job by continuously putting down the people she does business with.  You get to decide what is appropriate in your house and around your children.", "NTA - you've asked your sister to not talk about her sex work in your home or around your children.  She hasn't stopped.  I'd make it clear that you love her and enjoy her company, and that she's welcome back if she will abide by your rules.  I mean, you're not asking her to stop doing it, just to stop talking about it since it makes you uncomfortable in the house that is supposed to be your safe place.", "NTA-I know each person that is considered a sex worker is different.  I know what I do is still considered that, but I don't feel as though that defines me.  I don't talk to any family or close friends about anything I do, not because I am embarrassed by it, but I know they wouldn't understand or approve of it.  If someone I knew asked me not to talk about sex around their kids, I would for sure abide by their request...that isn't hard, it is called respect.", "NTA. You didn't ban her because of her job. You banned her for not being willing to stop talking about a subject you didn't want discussed in your house. \n\nWell, she has the right to talk about anything she wants, but she doesn't have the right to be in your house while she's doing it. You're well within reason to ban her unless/until she's prepared to obey your house rules.", "NTA. If you decide that having her saying rude things around your child will negatively impact them, its not their business.", "The old adage, \"my house, my rules\" is a good one. NTA", "NTA. I consider sex work to be legitimate employment but it's an adult topic and if you don't want it spoken about around your family she absolutely should respect that. Not to mention that your sister just sounds like a horrible vindictive person.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds like a morally empty AH who takes pleasure in destroying marriages and the lives of other women. She would almost certainly not be a good influence on your children.\n\nETA: this was not at all a comment on sex workers in general but his sister specifically.", "NTA. Your house. Your rules. If she can\u2019t respect that then it\u2019s her problem.", "You\u2019re well within your rights and are probably using good judgment here. The issue is not that she is a sex worker? It\u2019s that she runs her mouth about things that I\u2019m sure are private to her clients and that no one really wants to hear about. And her values seem to be rather crap. NTA", "Are the kids already there in the first place? That part seems to be missing from your post.", "NTA, clearly. I view sex work positively and I could even see her making a point that being free to talk about her work is a means to normalize sex work, which I think it should be. But at the end of the day, it's your home and you have the right to curate the behavior of those who are guests.", "INFO:  Are the kids in the house yet or are you pre-emptively banning her?", "NTA! You established a boundary about your sister not discussing her work around your children. She did not follow that boundary. You followed through. and now she needs to live with the consequences of her actions.", "INFO:\n\nBesides \"Very Very Obvious Hints\", has anyone actually sat down spoken to your sister about how you feel when she talks about her night job? Speaking from experience (my own) some people can't takes hints.\n\nEdit: NTA. I must have missed it the first time while reading. You told her, but she persisted.", "Nta. Go you!", "INFO: when you say it's \"not an OK thing to do\" do you mean sex work in general? Or specifically taking gratification from knowing that men are cheating on their wives with you?\n\nIf the former ESH, sex work is real work, that doesn't excuse your sister's crass behavior and stepping on your boundaries of appropriate topics, but it's going way too far to say you need to raise your kids to look down on and not have respect for anyone who does sex work whether out of necessity or simply because it's work they like doing.\n\nIf the latter NTA, your sister's behavior is pretty shitty, not because it's sex work but because she gets gratification from and brags about knowing other people are having relationship issues that she's involved in. Which I guess in itself is kinda her business but that she insists on bragging about it to you when you ask her not to is way over the line.", "Actually. Why she chose the job?\nWhat made her turn to do that job?", "It's understandable that you don't want your children to be exposed to certain topics or behaviors, especially when it comes to sex work. However, banning your sister from your home may not have been the most effective way to address the issue. You should communicate with your sister in a calm and respectful manner one more time. Go through the pro and cons, because loosing a relationship like that can be really painful. \n\nNext, Consider why your sister is behaving like that it may be possible she is struggling and jealous of your life and talking about her job is a coping mechanism. \n\nOverall, it's important to approach the situation with empathy  while also setting boundaries to protect  your family. It's possible to address the issue without going to a complete ban, and finding a solution that is the best for both people so currently. EVERYONE SUCKS but if she doesn't care even after the talk then its NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
