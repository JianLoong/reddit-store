Recently my fianc\u00e9 came to town to finalize his outfits for the wedding and his brother and brothers wife (we\u2019ll call her C) came along with him. \n\nI attended BIL and C\u2019s wedding years prior but had never really talked to C properly. I had tried to but she never reciprocated any conversation and would usually refrain to ignoring me, yet I still kept my feelings towards her amicable. \n\nReturning to the situation, we all reached the store and everything was going smoothly at first. Me, my fianc\u00e9 and BIL were all actively discussing different looks that suited my fianc\u00e9 while C was busy on her phone/talking on the phone the entire time. My BIL told me she was looking at different dresses to wear at the functions and in an attempt to make conversation, I asked her what her choices were. She ignored me and would only show her husband (my BIL). I brushed it off because I wasn\u2019t about to call her out when it didn\u2019t really bother me that much\u2014 I was used to her ignoring me. When my fianc\u00e9s outfits were decided, we moved to the lady\u2019s section because C was ready to order her dresses. Again, I minded my business and let her do her thing. As she was discussing the dress I overheard her say it was red. In my culture, it is pretty much known that you don\u2019t wear red on the wedding day because that\u2019s typically what the bride wears (same thing as not wearing white to a wedding). I looked over to my fianc\u00e9 and he was just as confused as I was. He told his brother that I was wearing red that day, with him telling C as well. I thought maybe she understood and walked away expecting her to choose a different color, only for her to choose red again. At that point I was just shocked at what was going on. I\u2019ve never held any ill will towards her so I wasn\u2019t sure where all this hostility was coming from. Before I could speak up, my fianc\u00e9 stepped in again to remind her that my dress is red. You could cut the tension in the air but finally she decided on a different color and we finally left. \n\nAfter shopping, I had planned for us to have dinner before they left as a little treat for them coming this far. Unfortunately, even though I tried to keep dinner easy going it was just very awkward. C did not eat anything at all and was absent half of the time to talk on the phone. \nAfter dinner, my fianc\u00e9 and BIL said their goodbyes to me. C did not say anything, walked to their car and sat inside. My BIL gave me an apologetic expression and my fianc\u00e9 told me to just ignore her. \n\nI went home very upset. I wasn\u2019t aware me simply requesting to change the dress color was that unacceptable. \n\nA few hours later, I messaged my fianc\u00e9 asking if they reached safety and he told me that upon reaching C flipped out and broke the TV, saying \u201chow could I tell her what color she can\u2019t wear?!\u201d\u2026\nI just wanted my wedding to go smoothly but now I\u2019m not sure what to expect. \n\n(And no, I didn\u2019t wear the same color as her during her wedding so it couldn\u2019t possibly be some personal vendetta)\n\nJust to clear some things up (Edit):\n- We\u2019re all South Asian so SIL is not racist. \n\n- She lives in fianc\u00e9 and BILs family home (joint living\u2026 where I too will be living for some time ((yay))\u2026).\n \n- I couldn\u2019t possibly say if she\u2019s abusive to her husband or not as I\u2019ve never had that conversation with BIL before nor is it my place to do so (I can only hope he talks to someone about it if she is abusing him).\n\n- I can\u2019t not invite her to the wedding as she isn\u2019t like this in front of everyone and she would make some story about how I\u2019m at fault.\n\n(Edit 2):\nThank you to everyone who took their time to read all of this and for the kind messages as well.

Even if you knew, there is no concept of not wearing the same color as The bride as an etiquette or manners issue.

It's not limited to just the bride like white is for western weddings. In any south Asian wedding, you'll find that almost half the guests are wearing red. It's just a default wedding color. \n\nSo while it may be taboo for a guest to wear white in a western wedding, it's not the same for a south Asian wedding. SIL isn't the asshole for wanting to wear a red dress. That's a common color for many female guests and it's not unexpected for them to pick it. SIL is the asshole for the way she reacted by destroying property.

She says she's south Asian but the color red isn't limited to the bride in south Asian weddings. Yes red is a wedding color but it's something both the brides and guests can wear.

Hell it's even expected that some female guests will wear their own wedding dresses to someone else's wedding and that's actually a sign of respect. It'll actually be shocking if a bride bans red at her wedding. Most of OP's guests are gonna be wearing red so if doorman are turning ppl away, she's gonna have an empty wedding lol\n\nThis is an ESH situation. SIL for being rude and violent. OP for deliberately misrepresenting south Asian wedding etiquette and cultural norms to a majority American/western audience to gain ppl to her side", "Actually, in South Asian culture, while red is a traditional wedding color, it's not limited to the bride like white is for Western weddings. Both the guests and the bride can wear red. It's actually fairly common for guests to wear red. It's not a big deal (I'm South Asian and I've worn red with other guests to a bunch of weddings and it wasn't a problem). Hell, it's sometimes even acceptable to wear your own wedding dress to someone else's wedding. The only faux pas would be if you wore your full wedding jewelry set to the wedding as the bride's the only one to wear that (you can wear pieces from your wedding jewelry set but not the entire set).", "I am South Asian and OP is lying wearing red is not reserved for brides in South Asian culture. Actually many people wears red on wedding day .\n\nIt's completely normal for people to wear whatever they want .\n\nIt's part of western culture and fools who follow western culture blindly.", "OP better have at least 20 spare outfits since red is a common wedding guest color for south Asian weddings and I can guarantee that many female guests will be wearing red. Not sure why she's deliberately misrepresenting and bullshitting the significance of the color red in south Asian weddings", "Except by OP's own admission, she's south Asian. South Asian weddings are not a culture that practices \"don't wear the same color as the bride\" and they definitely won't do that with the color red. Red is a wedding color here but it's not limited to the bride. It's a color that both the bride and guests can wear. \n\nAnd in south Asia, a wedding isn't about the bride's day. The wedding is a about celebrating the union of the bride's family and the groom's family. In that regard, guests (especially future in-laws) are very important. There is no competition between guests and the bride/groom. The greatest respect a guest can give to the bride and groom on their wedding day is to wear their very best clothing. That's why it's sometimes common for women to wear their own wedding dresses to someone else's wedding. The more effort you put in your appearance at a South Asian wedding, the more you respect the bride/groom. This is what's traditional in a south Asian wedding. \n\nSo SIL isn't wrong for wanting to wear red at the wedding. It's a common choice for many wedding guests. She's wrong for breaking the TV and her reaction but her initial choice of wearing red isn't a big deal. Same as OP is wrong for claiming an entire color under false pretenses on south Asian wedding etiquette.", "Pretty sure that will have no effect bc red is a common color for guests to wear at south Asian weddings.

Sometimes I go to weddings where no pictures are allowed, not my thing, but I respect that.

Individual families and communities may have their own customs or a variation of a custom but some things can be generalised across the board. Ie. If someone says women wear white in western Christian weddings... that is the norm but yes, that doesn't mean every bride in the west wears white. This post is specifically talking about cultural etiquette and not a new custom she wanted to start up.", "She has mentioned that she\u2019s south Asian plus will live in a joint family setting which is more then enough to think of an Indian family.The entire post comes across as someone trying to justify her demands by lying and putting it on \u2019tradition\u2019", "Np. And I agree. The extravagence of the jewellery is what makes the bride stand out imo. Although, in my experience, I think the bridal trend is moving towards less extravagant jewellery and more extravagant dresses now. Looking back at the weddings of my parents' generation, they'd typically wear someone simplistic dresses but had very big jewellery sets. But the recent weddings I've been too, while the brides did wear a lot of big jewellery, the emphasis was more on their outfits and their full jewellery sets seem smaller. For one of my cousins, her wedding lehenga skirt was heavily sequined and weighed over 10 kg. This could just be something that's happening only in my circle or it could be some westernized influence (since me and my family do live in Canada). I haven't been back to a wedding in my native country so I don't know if this shift is happening solely in my Canadian community or if it's happening back home as well.", "I get how it can be confusing. Like, many people, in our south asian countries, will deliberately wear red to the wedding, inspite of being fully aware that it is rude. Just to show that they \"can\". Toxic behaviour. Unnecessary power trip. And anyone who is decent and self-respecting, would never do that. Like, it just says a lot ab the person. But generally there is no way to call people of the former category out, unless the bride herself takes a strong stand and risks the displeasure of some of her elderly relatives. But in most cases, the bride will have to swallow it like a bitter pill for the sake of \"family values\". \n\nAltho these days the practice of wearing red to somebody else's wedding is declining, thanks to people of the younger generation being able to be more assertive, etc..", "Some people don\u2019t want others to wear red to their weddings, others don\u2019t care. In my circles it\u2019s really normal to wear any colour you want, including rewearing your own wedding lehenga. In Indian-American families I\u2019ve seen that it\u2019s less acceptable. \n\nBut if someone said \u201cdon\u2019t wear red\u201d then you don\u2019t wear red. It\u2019s that simple.", "Assuming everyone is correct that OP is Indian, there is no one single Indian culture.  India is *incredibly* diverse.  Just think of how many languages there are, then there are the castes, then there are regional differences, then there are socio-economic differences, etc.  India is easily one of the most diverse nations in the world with far less cultural cohesion than another diverse nation like the US.\n\nSo cultural practices can vary a lot and still be \"Indian\".", "While some of China is in South Asia, when people refer to themselves as South Asian, they're referring solely to the Pakistan-India-Bangladesh-Sri Lanka region. If it was a Chinese person, they'll either call themselves Asian or East-Asian while if it was someone from Malaysia/Indonesia/Singapore/Philippines area, they'll sometimes refer to themselves as Southeast Asian. \n\nIn my experience as a South Asian woman, I've never heard of someone from China referring to themselves as South Asian. South Asia to me has always referred to the Indian subcontinent. I dont think a Chinese person would consider themselves South Asian even if parts of China are in South Asia. Kinda like how the majority of Russia is in Asia but Russians think of themselves as Europeans and not Asian.", "Lol I went to a south Asian wedding this summer and I wore red (like many of the other guests) and the bride and other aunties complimented my outfit. Was riding that high for so long", "Thank you for that. It's nice to know I had soaked up some half decent info. \n\nI'm a guy, so I'm less affected, but I'm going to guess I would stick out like a sore thumb in a suit, lol.", "Well I guess I and all of the rest of the shit-giving Indians on this post have a different South Asian culture than you and OP. There is no fear that the bride will be \"outshone\". And in my family, we make sure everyone looks tops for a wedding. And if red is my sisters colour, that is what she is wearing looking fabulous beside me (and she did and I will for hers). Like, we all know we the bride is... the dress colour shouldn't be the main tip off \ud83e\udd23", "How do you know she's starting it up and it's not part of her community's custom? Other comments have said they wouldn't want anyone else wearing red at their weddings", "Oh wow that\u2019s heavy! Are people maybe starting to focus more on jewellery because they can hand down the pieces to family?  It\u2019s so interesting to look at and compare how things were with past generations\n\nEdit for typo * WERE ppl more focussed on jewellery to hand down lol maybe it\u2019s not as much of a thing now, are families getting smaller?", "Thank you for the explanation. I wasnt sure and your response was great. Thank you for taking the time to reply", "Why are you being downvoted,you said the truth\ud83d\ude02", "Because of her post. And knowing South Asian culture. That's how.", "Np. I love teaching others about my culture (and learning about other ppl's cultures). It's all so interesting :D", "TIL all South Asian wedding customs are identical"]}
