Recently my fianc\u00e9 came to town to finalize his outfits for the wedding and his brother and brothers wife (we\u2019ll call her C) came along with him. \n\nI attended BIL and C\u2019s wedding years prior but had never really talked to C properly. I had tried to but she never reciprocated any conversation and would usually refrain to ignoring me, yet I still kept my feelings towards her amicable. \n\nReturning to the situation, we all reached the store and everything was going smoothly at first. Me, my fianc\u00e9 and BIL were all actively discussing different looks that suited my fianc\u00e9 while C was busy on her phone/talking on the phone the entire time. My BIL told me she was looking at different dresses to wear at the functions and in an attempt to make conversation, I asked her what her choices were. She ignored me and would only show her husband (my BIL). I brushed it off because I wasn\u2019t about to call her out when it didn\u2019t really bother me that much\u2014 I was used to her ignoring me. When my fianc\u00e9s outfits were decided, we moved to the lady\u2019s section because C was ready to order her dresses. Again, I minded my business and let her do her thing. As she was discussing the dress I overheard her say it was red. In my culture, it is pretty much known that you don\u2019t wear red on the wedding day because that\u2019s typically what the bride wears (same thing as not wearing white to a wedding). I looked over to my fianc\u00e9 and he was just as confused as I was. He told his brother that I was wearing red that day, with him telling C as well. I thought maybe she understood and walked away expecting her to choose a different color, only for her to choose red again. At that point I was just shocked at what was going on. I\u2019ve never held any ill will towards her so I wasn\u2019t sure where all this hostility was coming from. Before I could speak up, my fianc\u00e9 stepped in again to remind her that my dress is red. You could cut the tension in the air but finally she decided on a different color and we finally left. \n\nAfter shopping, I had planned for us to have dinner before they left as a little treat for them coming this far. Unfortunately, even though I tried to keep dinner easy going it was just very awkward. C did not eat anything at all and was absent half of the time to talk on the phone. \nAfter dinner, my fianc\u00e9 and BIL said their goodbyes to me. C did not say anything, walked to their car and sat inside. My BIL gave me an apologetic expression and my fianc\u00e9 told me to just ignore her. \n\nI went home very upset. I wasn\u2019t aware me simply requesting to change the dress color was that unacceptable. \n\nA few hours later, I messaged my fianc\u00e9 asking if they reached safety and he told me that upon reaching C flipped out and broke the TV, saying \u201chow could I tell her what color she can\u2019t wear?!\u201d\u2026\nI just wanted my wedding to go smoothly but now I\u2019m not sure what to expect. \n\n(And no, I didn\u2019t wear the same color as her during her wedding so it couldn\u2019t possibly be some personal vendetta)\n\nJust to clear some things up (Edit):\n- We\u2019re all South Asian so SIL is not racist. \n\n- She lives in fianc\u00e9 and BILs family home (joint living\u2026 where I too will be living for some time ((yay))\u2026).\n \n- I couldn\u2019t possibly say if she\u2019s abusive to her husband or not as I\u2019ve never had that conversation with BIL before nor is it my place to do so (I can only hope he talks to someone about it if she is abusing him).\n\n- I can\u2019t not invite her to the wedding as she isn\u2019t like this in front of everyone and she would make some story about how I\u2019m at fault.\n\n(Edit 2):\nThank you to everyone who took their time to read all of this and for the kind messages as well.

Even if you knew, there is no concept of not wearing the same color as The bride as an etiquette or manners issue.

Trust me, no matter how much you love your fiance, putting up with that environment for an unspecified amount of time really ruins your mental health. I've heard too many bitter older ladies talk to ever marry into a joint family. Make a plan now on how you plan to deal with your Sil, before you're married and tied to that family.", "Was looking for this because yes, this idea of not wearing the same colour as the bride seems very western or very least, not Indian. I've been to plenty of weddings where the female guests are wearing red suits or lenghas.  Of course the SIL is the asshole for breaking the TV and her behaviour is unacceptable in any scenario. But if OP is having a traditional Indian wedding - she may want to prepare for lots of shades of red on her wedding guests.", "It's customary to dress way up for Indian weddings. For many women, their wedding outfits are the fanciest clothes they own. It's not uncommon for women to wear their own bridal outfits when they are wedding guests. This is not an effort to outshine the bride -- the dressier you are, the more respect you show to the couple.", "Exactly. Her cosister is paying the elder daughter in law shit. And she is rude AF. But the \" in our culture only the bride wears red and other are not allowed to\" is total bs by OP. YOU don't want to have other people wear red (good luck with that reds, maroons, oranges, pinks, magentas are gonna be there in every South Asian ceremony Indian or not) say so.  It's your wedding anyway and the couple and their families decide what they want. Don't do this iTs oUr cUlTuRe game.", "Yes, thank you! OP said they're all South Asian, so I was confused about the whole concept of not wearing the same colour. \n\nWe have like a 1000 female guests lol and the guests in our weddings are all about showing off, it's literally impossible that at least a few female guests aren't wearing Red. In fact, it's a pretty common colour for weddings.", "OP said it was her culture, but didn't mention the culture of her fianc\u00e9 and future SIL.\n\nFrom my understanding Red is reserved for the bride predominately in Asian cultures, and I suspect that the wife is just Racist (or if they are from the same culture, possibly colourist).", "It's stupid.", "But it isn't because regular dresses aren't designed in the same way a wedding dress is.\n\nEveryone disagreeing with me is just petty and shallow.", "Yes she is. You don't get to decide my opinion for me. \n\nIt's a color. Everyone is being an asshole about this.", "I couldn\u2019t read it. You lost me after the first paragraph.", "Assuming op is Indian, I can\u2019t imagine SIL actually thinking wearing red to a wedding when you are not the bride is even remotely ok. The shame and shit she will get will be epic and I think at this point op should let her wear it. Let the other female relatives sort her out.", "Agree. \n\nBefore I got to OP's edit, I assumed she was Chinese or Vietnamese. I'm the latter, but raised in the US, and C just reminds me of a lot of older women I knew. And I immediately knew regardless of OP's specific ethnicigy, whatever advice AITA was going to give her was going to be totally ineffective. \n\nI've met women like SIL before. You can't handle them using American/Westernisms like \"Cut them off and establish your boundaries!!\". It would be the equivalent of fully unleashing a demon. Westerners are really not equipped to deal with these dynamics properly. And what many people see as an ideal result in the US--cutting off everyone who ever disrespects or is mean to you--would leave someone like OP in a very undesirable spot. Many people love and cherish their family, and they often rely on them as well in ways that many Americans just don't. People don't want to have to cut off every single relative.\n\nEdit: the solution is *obviously* not to \"be a doormat\". Just pointing out the situation is likely more complex, and can't be solved just by \"uninvite C and hire more security.\"", "OP stated they are Asian.", "Ohio security to make sure that anybody in Red would be turned away", "No, you don't disinvite your relatives to the wedding specially your future hb' s brother's wife who will be an integral part of the groom's party, however unpleasant and gratuitously rude she may be. I have not invited some relatives I've lost touch with or an uncle who rudely declined a wedding invitation from our family but that's different from \" disinviting\" which can lead to a family feud. Future SIL seems to be jealous of OP. Her bad behaviour is off the charts. After marriage move away from this toxic woman asap.", "And BIL is in a relationship where he is being subjected to verbal and emotional abuse, at the very least. I\u2019m betting this isn\u2019t the first time she has lashed out violently. BIL\u2019s reaction was to try and calm her down, not \u201cWTF do you think you\u2019re doing.\u201d He\u2019s used to the behavior.", "And to add to the culturally specific part, I'd like some more info. \n\nOP, is this also SIL's culture, or just yours? Either way, she's TA of course. Either she's of the same culture and very much knows better, or she's a different culture and is belittling yours.", "I like this", "Worded it perfectly.", "True. The closer you are to the bride/groom, the more extravagant your dress is.", "OP is getting a lot of validation in this thread like, \"it's universally known that no one wears the same colour as the bride\" and \"wait until all the other family members see her at the wedding and cut her down to size\". I worry she is going to believe this is the actual reception she will get. She will be complaining about her SIL's red suit to an auntie probably also decked out in red lol. \n\nAgain, not defending the SIL's crazy actions - but OP is making some cultural missteps here. Indian weddings aren't \"all about the bride\", it is about families joining. And you don't start that bond by dictating what people wear to \"your day\" - it's their day too in our culture.\n\nEta: actually the more I think about this post I wonder if its just a made up scenario by OP as some sort of reddit social experiment. If she's in South Asian culture, and even if she herself didn't wear red to her SIL's wedding, there's no way she didn't see the colour or shades of it on a hundred other guests. ....like she would just know that this just isn't a thing ....", "I don't know, it seemed the BIL was very familiar with the importance of Red also, and it seemed that fiance BIL and SIL all live in the same home by the use of \"*the* TV\". She had to understand the importance of Red herself to be so vindictive in her behavior.\n\nBut we won't know unless OP clarifies.\n\n\nEdit: Just as I posted this she does clarify they are the same culture and it was the family home.", "You clearly know nothing about Indian culture. Brides wear red.", "You're literally only thinking of Western dresses but okay", "The one with the two sentences in four lines? Lol. Go back to twitter.", "I agree with the idea of letting the other female relatives sort her out.  She sounds like a narcissist, so sick the mother and mother in law on her.", "Actually,in Indian literally dozen of women end up wearing red on the wedding day. Some even wear their own wedding dress on other's wedding( I am not even exaggerating). Uninviting her SIL is pretty much impossible(if op is Indian),here family is beyond everything and uninviting & stuff doesn't not happen here.As said by another commenter, you can't cut ties or go no contact.\nAs said by OP,she has to live with her in-laws after the wedding which is a very common practice here,lc or nc will not work.\n\nEdit:To add more context", "That's what *I* was thinking. Let her wear red. It's better for everyone to see how she is than for her to make up some story about OP.", "Not cutting ties is exactly what allows people to think doing stuff like this is okay, no consequences. \n\nIm not one to disparage another culture, the overt individualism in the western world has done its own damage, but accountability has become near standard and it\u2019s making people behave better I believe.", "So what do they do? Live as a doormat for C's hostility? Would cutting C out mean cutting everyone out as well? Why would they stick up for C?  Looks more like C doesn't care about family harmony", "So\u2026 what can/could OP do in this situation? Any advice?? It sounds like a lost scenario to me as an outsider.", "and where do you think india is?", "So what? You pointing out that OP stated she is Asian adds no new or overlooked information and therefore is of no value at all to the comment you're directly replying to nor the thread where people wonder if OP might be Chinese, Vietnamese or Indian. In my books it is still common knowledge that China is East Asia,  Vietnam South-East Asia and India is South Asia.\n\nYou pointing out OP is Asian for an answer to these three possibilities  doesn't give any clue which of these guesses is correct since it has been made clear by OP for a fact that she is from Asia and all three possibilities the commenters consider are Asian countries and therefore it was out of doubt for any of them. \n\nIt's like people wondering if someone is British, Dutch or French and someone thinks to clarify they said they were Europeans as if that would answer anything in that context.", "Maybe not disinvite her to the wedding, but simply as one of the bridal party? After all, a basic requirement for anyone in a bridal party should be that they actually like the bride.", "Why do men marry women like that? Are they attracted to this \"type\"?", "Fair enough.\n\nGlad we got confirmation from the OP.\n\nMy assumption was based on her saying \"my culture\" rather than \"our culture\" but that could be a result of English being a second language, or simply an odd turn of phrase.", "Sic*", ">\u201dActually,in Indian literally dozen of women end up wearing red on the wedding day. Some even wear their own wedding dress on other's wedding( I am not even exaggerating)\u201d\n\n\nIf this is ordinary behavior, why is OP concerned about future SIL wearing red to her wedding?  This is a bit confusing.", "They said they are Asian", "I was confused about that as well.. she didn\u2019t specify which South Asian country but afaik, many people wear red in south Asian weddings.. not just the bride.", "Yeah there's definitely a balance to be had. This kind of behavior is terrible and shouldn't be tolerated. I am a pretty firm believer personally of not putting up with people who aren't kind to me, but I have talked to enough friends and relatives to realize this is NOT universal at all. And that people have a lot of fears and insecurities that keep them from.being assertive...What works for me doesn't work for them. \n\nMy point is: the Western advice of \"cut them off!\" is useless here, because it doesn't actually help OP unravel anything. It's better for OP to ask people from her culture, who understand these dynamics and thus will give more relevant advice.", "> Why would they stick up for C?\n\nIt's less that they would stick up for C, but blankly uninviting C in the way people suggest would give C ammunition and put OP as the \"bad guy\". We also don't know how C interacts with other family, so there are extra layers of things to navigate. \n\n> So what do they do?\n\nIdk, I don't know their culture or family dynamic \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f nowhere did I suggest that they live as a doormat, just that the advice given here isn't likely to be helpful because it's not exactly actionable. That said, another commenter's advice of \"sic the female relatives, especially the older ones, on her\" is pretty good. \n\n(I've seen this kind of AITA thread before, and it sometimes felt like OP and the commenters were talking past each other. But hopefully it can at least convince OP that C is in the wrong, so that she can plan accordingly.)", "ITT: people understand neither what countries are in Asia nor what \"South Asia\" means.\n\n(I kind of want to know what countries they had in mind when they read \"South Asian\"...)", "As per Indian marriage customs, the groom and bride have separate parties or sides The groom and his family and friends come to the bride's place to marry her and take her back with them.
