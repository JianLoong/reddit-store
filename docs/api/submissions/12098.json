I've spent the past year in therapy getting over my toxic upbringing and learning to not be a pushover, whether to her or in general. She doesn't have many friends and is separated, so she views me as her sole friend/caregiver/confidante/partner all-in-one (even though I just want to live my own life).\n\nThis afternoon, she called my cell to come over and \"rest after shopping in my neighbourhood\" (she doesn't live far, about half hour drive from my condo). I was sleeping, so the call went to voicemail. Then, after receiving no answer, she proceeded to drive to my condo building, knock on my door, and when there was no answer at my door, she just let herself in... then she lay down on my sofa like nobody's business and started watching videos on her phone. I woke up from my nap after being alarmed that my door was open. \n\nThere's a bit of context to be added here though - my mon paid the deposit for this condo, although it's under my name and I'm paying all the mortgage and fees.   That's why she has a spare key, in case of \"emergencies\". \n\nAnyway, there she was, and also carrying a big bag of miscellaneous stuff she bought \"for me\" which I never asked for. Basically, all of this was entirely unsolicited and uninvited. It felt like a huge intrusion into my personal space. I was annoyed, so we didn't speak a word for some time. Then, I told her I'm getting ready to head out, she should get ready to leave, and also she is absolutely not allowed to do this again. \n\nIn response to this, my mom started crying and screaming, saying she paid for my house so she's entitled to come here and rest, and that I'm no longer her daughter. I told her to also take the stuff she bought \"for me\", because I never asked for it. Then she was leaving she said \"fuck you, we're strangers now\" and we haven't spoken another word since.\n\nBefore I talk to my therapist about this...
