We love the dog and it is always a pleasure, which she pays us for even though we would do it for free. \n\nIn Nov 2021 we took in our now 7 and 4yo half-sisters as my dad and his wife are unfit to care for them. Summer 2022 came around and I told my cousin that Monty would have to stay at our house for the week as hauling two kids an hour away to stay at her house didn\u2019t appeal to me, but she insisted moving Monty\u2019s stuff would be more difficult than bringing kids to hers (lol). My husband said the girls would probably enjoy the adventure so we ended up taking them there. Only thing was, it was way more tiring than it used to be as I had to watch my then 3yo constantly with Monty as you never know with toddlers and dogs, and Monty isn\u2019t used to children. It was still nice but not easy at all. \n\nAt the end of May my cousin called and told me the dates for this years dog sitting. I told her I would have to confirm with my husband about getting time off work.\n\nI was meaning to speak to my husband and then\u2026 bombshell. June 5th we get a phone call that my dad\u2019s wife had had a new baby. She was premature and addicted to opioids. Huge shock to us but we said yes to taking her in and that has consumed our lives since. 3 intense weeks in the NICU and then living with a very fussy little baby, it\u2019s been rough. Dog sitting very much slipped my mind along with everything else. \n\nSo my cousin calls me today. Asks how the baby is, and then says \u201cIs she looking forward to her first holiday?\u201d\u2026 she was still expecting us to be going there in August with an 8 week old, surprise, tiny baby.  I told her we would not be able to do it this year. I have barely left the house since we got her home, and she screams if we put her down so there is no way I would subject her to an hour long car ride.\n\nMy cousin said she could bring Monty to us, but I said it\u2019s too much right now and I\u2019m not prepared to take care of a dog and have to watch my kids constantly around him. \n\nShe got really upset and said I have stopped caring about Monty since I got the kids and they have replaced him. She says we have let her down as now she has to struggle to find someone to look after her \u2018baby\u2019, even though we had committed to doing it every year, and then she told me she\u2019ll remember this when I ask her to babysit my kids (I have never asked). \n\nShe thinks the least I could have done is told her we couldn\u2019t do it as soon as we knew about the baby. I honestly have not thought about dog sitting once since June 5th, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to expect that she would know we wouldn\u2019t be able to do it this year. I have been worrying about the baby so much I have barely spared a second to worry about my kids, let alone someone else\u2019s dog.", "created_utc": 1688926395, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14v5fr1/aita_for_telling_my_cousin_we_cant_dog_sit_for/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are taking care of two young children and a premature baby that was born addicted to opioids. Of course, the well being of the children and baby are more important than your cousin's dog. Sometimes the entitlement of people truly is astounding.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m speechless that she thought you would just travel with an 8 week old who\u2019s having a rough start. I hope you never ask her to babysit cause she seems to know nothing about kids.", "Nta. Your cousin is thought!! A big one. I get it. Someone people have such an attachment to a pet they think and act as if it\u2019s a person. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a pet. It\u2019s nowhere close to a newborn who is addicted to drugs. If all else fails she can put the dog in a daycare type thing (my mind is blank on what it\u2019s called). The baby NEEDS quiet. The baby NEEDS consistency. New sounds and new smells and new routines can make baby\u2019s recovery even more difficult. Plus you deserve to not have something more to throw you off your game.", "NTA. I sympathize with your cousin to a point if she doesn\u2019t have someone else she trusts, but that\u2019s ultimately not your problem. You have a lot of responsibility right now, and it\u2019s completely understandable to just not be able to make it work anymore.", "NTA at all. \nYou do have a very entitled cousin though who seems rather selfish", "NTA and the special shout out to you for taking these kids. You are beyond wonderful.", "NTA - \"You care less about my dog now that you have children to look after\"\n\nOf course they replaced Monty. The welfare of the kids takes paramount over your cousin's dog. She sounds silly even saying something like that. Yes you watched him in the past but now you have kids to worry about.\n\nI'm sure Monty is a great dog but he's ultimately your cousin's responsibility. You have chosen to take on a bigger responsibility with your half-siblings. They need to be your priority. \n\nMonty will likely be perfectly fine staying with an experienced pet sitter. He's probably going to get even better care than he would with you having to juggle handling the kids and his needs.", "NTA. These kids **need** you and you're doing a good job taking care of them. Entitled cousin can find another solution for Monty.", "Nta. They shouldnt have assumed", "NTA\n\nYou have to know you're not the asshole in this situation.\n\nOf course Monty is a much lower priority for you than very young children.\n\nHer expectation that you would care for her dog in this situation makes her a total asshole.", "Let's be clear. This is not about how much your cousin loves their dog. It's about how much they love their *vacation*. Your family had a series of very serious emergencies (that you stepped up to handle beautifully, by the way.) How is it less important for you to take care of three orphaned children desperately in need of care than it is for her to get to go on her usual vacation? \n\nHow dare she threaten to \"never do a favor for you,\" when you've been doing them for her all along? \n\nWhat have we come to that you, a person who just took in a drug addicted premature infant, have to even ASK if you're an asshole for not facilitating your spoiled cousin's vacation?

Your 3 kids' needs are more important than her dog.", "NTA, people who get pets need to learn that unless they can find smb to petsit, they'll have to cancell their plans or look for dog friendly places \ud83e\udd37", "As a lifetime dog owner...your cousin is very presumptuous in assuming you're readily available each and every year.  Things happen...this is on her to adjust.", "Yeah\u2026. She said we used to hang out way more and we used to make an effort with Monty. Even told me I don\u2019t love him as much as I claim lol\u2026 like yeah I used to have a lot more time and he\u2019s cute. Now he\u2019s just not a priority. \n\nAlso note she doesn\u2019t ever bring him to us or visit our kids, she actually told me to my face she doesn\u2019t like my 7yo\u2026 (most likely because 7yo took a while to warm up to Monty and used to be scared of him)", "Oh shit. Yeah no.\nNTA at all\nI thought it was the mother addicted to opioids but the baby?\nOh God how did the baby get addicted?", "Agreed. It can be hard to find pet care you trust. I get that firsthand, I have one, maybe two options for mine. But if that person is full or busy or just can\u2019t, that\u2019s on me to deal with, not them. And the OP has a ton of responsibility right now and needs to focus on the kids. It\u2019s really unfair for the cousin to throw a fit. Anything other than \u201cthanks for letting me know/how is everyone doing/let me know if you need anything\u201d is an AH response.", "I suggested putting Monty in a doggy daycare type place but she said he won\u2019t get enough attention and it\u2019s too expensive. She then text me saying she looked into it but its full already she only has < 4 weeks notice. \n\nI do feel bad for not giving her more notice but I genuinely didn\u2019t think about it and it\u2019s not as though she called or text me to confirm and I ignored it or something", "That is very true. I think I\u2019m just wondering if I should have let her know sooner, but I would have if I had thought about it. She\u2019s basically saying now she has been left with very few options at short notice. I\n\nBut yeah she doesn\u2019t seem to care that our lives went from relatively stable with our two girls to spending every spare minute at the hospital watching a tiny baby go through withdrawals, within the space of a 10 minute phone call. THAT is short notice.", "She is, so the baby was born addicted too. She had to go through withdrawals and was in a ton of pain. She\u2019s much better now but still a lot fussier than a normal baby.", "The baby\u2019s mom was using while pregnant so baby was born addicted. It\u2019s a long horrible recovery for babies.", "She is that type I see. Time to just step back from her. Monty is a dog, not a person. And she keeps putting him on the same level as these kids. It's not healthy and a lot of things could go wrong if one of them has a negative run in with the dog that results in a bite or injury. Not to mention bringing a fussy baby around a dog that is being treated the way Monty is. He likely isn't given boundaries like a normal dog, and a fussy baby may elicit reactions in him that you aren't ready to handle. You have to prioritize 2 girls getting used to a new sibling who is super fussy, along with dealing in raising a baby who may or may not have longterm issues from the birth mom's choices.", "She sounds like a real peach of a doodle bug.", "This is a very common issue. Mom uses while pregnant and it crosses the placenta. Baby is born addicted. Detox is horrific. OP is either fostering or adopting them due to her dad and step mom\u2019s actions.", "The baby was exposed to drugs in utero.", "I think she thinks it became my responsibility after she told me the dates, like I should have then said no ASAP if we couldn\u2019t but it\u2019s been over a month and I haven\u2019t messaged her to let her know\n\nBut like, she hasn\u2019t messaged me about it either", "Any normal sane person would not be upset at you for this. It\u2019s not normal to put the needs of children below a dog. As a normal sane person I can assure you\u2026as soon as I found out about your baby I would have been looking for a new care taker for my dog.", "That's awful.\nI'm sorry the baby and mother is going through that.\nYou're a wonderful person \u263a\ufe0f", "Yes she thinks he is her baby and tells me all the time I should have got a dog as they are better than kids. She\u2019s one of those people I just humour because she\u2019s a relative and normally I don\u2019t waste any energy worrying about her comments. She has problems and I think actually wants kids but is single still so she has become one of these extreme people who thinks a dog is the same as/ better than a child.", "Yeah no, you had your hands and brain full. That\u2019s a lot to juggle.", "Agreed!\n\nNot only are you NTA - but what you\u2019re doing in adopting 3 children (who are now able to stay with biological family- you and their full siblings) is extremely selfless, loving and courageous.\n\nTaking care of a newborn is no easy feat in normal circumstances, and your poor baby was born with serious medical complications. Of course they\u2019re your priority!!!"]}
