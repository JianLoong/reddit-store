We love the dog and it is always a pleasure, which she pays us for even though we would do it for free. \n\nIn Nov 2021 we took in our now 7 and 4yo half-sisters as my dad and his wife are unfit to care for them. Summer 2022 came around and I told my cousin that Monty would have to stay at our house for the week as hauling two kids an hour away to stay at her house didn\u2019t appeal to me, but she insisted moving Monty\u2019s stuff would be more difficult than bringing kids to hers (lol). My husband said the girls would probably enjoy the adventure so we ended up taking them there. Only thing was, it was way more tiring than it used to be as I had to watch my then 3yo constantly with Monty as you never know with toddlers and dogs, and Monty isn\u2019t used to children. It was still nice but not easy at all. \n\nAt the end of May my cousin called and told me the dates for this years dog sitting. I told her I would have to confirm with my husband about getting time off work.\n\nI was meaning to speak to my husband and then\u2026 bombshell. June 5th we get a phone call that my dad\u2019s wife had had a new baby. She was premature and addicted to opioids. Huge shock to us but we said yes to taking her in and that has consumed our lives since. 3 intense weeks in the NICU and then living with a very fussy little baby, it\u2019s been rough. Dog sitting very much slipped my mind along with everything else. \n\nSo my cousin calls me today. Asks how the baby is, and then says \u201cIs she looking forward to her first holiday?\u201d\u2026 she was still expecting us to be going there in August with an 8 week old, surprise, tiny baby.  I told her we would not be able to do it this year. I have barely left the house since we got her home, and she screams if we put her down so there is no way I would subject her to an hour long car ride.\n\nMy cousin said she could bring Monty to us, but I said it\u2019s too much right now and I\u2019m not prepared to take care of a dog and have to watch my kids constantly around him. \n\nShe got really upset and said I have stopped caring about Monty since I got the kids and they have replaced him. She says we have let her down as now she has to struggle to find someone to look after her \u2018baby\u2019, even though we had committed to doing it every year, and then she told me she\u2019ll remember this when I ask her to babysit my kids (I have never asked). \n\nShe thinks the least I could have done is told her we couldn\u2019t do it as soon as we knew about the baby. I honestly have not thought about dog sitting once since June 5th, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to expect that she would know we wouldn\u2019t be able to do it this year.

If all else fails she can put the dog in a daycare type thing (my mind is blank on what it\u2019s called). The baby NEEDS quiet. The baby NEEDS consistency. New sounds and new smells and new routines can make baby\u2019s recovery even more difficult. Plus you deserve to not have something more to throw you off your game.", "NTA. I sympathize with your cousin to a point if she doesn\u2019t have someone else she trusts, but that\u2019s ultimately not your problem.

This is not about how much your cousin loves their dog. It's about how much they love their *vacation*.

Not to mention bringing a fussy baby around a dog that is being treated the way Monty is.

I get that her dog is more important to HER than my kids, but then she expects ME to feel that her dog is on par with my kids. I \u201clove\u201d Monty but not like, human love.

She knew she probably wasn't going to like the answer and that's why she never followed up and just assumed you would still do it anyway. Because that is what she wanted the outcome to be.
