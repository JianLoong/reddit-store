I've been driving for 10 years and I've never had anything like this happen...  \nHad I known I definitely wouldn't have..", "I can believe the parking prices, especially in a major city, but this is my first time hearing of cameras that ticket you if you so much as touch your phone while driving. Especially since not everyone who touches their phones is texting or calling people... I for example often listen to music in my car and the music is on my phone, so I have to touch the phone to skip a song (car is an older model that doesn't have Bluetooth so the music can be controlled from the car itself). Then again, I live in a country where such a law doesn't exist.", "I am living with bad anxiety at the moment, this is the second panic attack ive had in three weeks. I have C-PTSD, am on meds and I am in therapy. Not doing amazingly at the moment.", "I mean I very strictly have never so much as glanced at my phone while driving (usually it is in my bag), but if I set it on the center console while loading my vehicle and then forget it sometimes slides onto my seat while turning (or in between the seats on the floor), so I don\u2019t move it because I\u2019m driving. I know many people look at and use their phones, so I\u2019m not saying this is what happened to OP, but if it happened to me, I would have been absolutely devastated and completely innocent of using my phone. However I would have fought the ticket in court using phone usage data to prove my phone wasn\u2019t unlocked at all while I was driving.", "But a thousand dollars?", "It\u2019s not your husbands responsibility to make sure you are punished for doing something wrong. That\u2019s what the license suspension and riding the bus is for. He doesn\u2019t get to also punish you by making you give up your parking space that you need", "I live in a country where all cellphone operations must be hands free when the car is on.\nWe don\u2019t have cameras that can spot a phone on your lap.\nWe do have creative traffic cops who can spot people on their phones with their own eyes.", "That can be just as much of a distraction though, a friend flipped his car across 2 lanes of traffic changing a song. It's the taking your focus off the road, not specifically texting or calling - and changing music is as bad as texting.", "What country are you in that you lose your license for five months with a clean license?", "Operating a phone whilst driving is as bad as driving drunk: https://www.livescience.com/872-cell-phones-drivers-bad-drunks.html\nIf you could get out of the offence by claiming you were just touching it, the law would be toothless.", "I guess it depends on the city. With it being so expensive it tells me parking is really hard to come by. If she gives it up she may not get it back and that will jeopardize her job.", "That ship sailed, but she\u2019s already been punished by the legal system, it\u2019s not her spouses job to abuse her over it further.", "* and Chinese balloons floating overhead.", "Just make sure that things are clear from the beginning. Not that things get awkward after 5 month.\nMaybe the carpool will live on but maybe you want your spot back but you have an /r/entitledpeople problem.", "Same here", "Holy crap,just having it in your lap is illegal? Shoot... My mom drives with her phone under her leg and mine is usually at my hip holder (though I don't drive) so this seems insane to me! Better safe than sorry I guess but yikes! \n\nNTA, though. You pay for it. You could put a storage shed there and it wouldn't matter. It's yours.", "NTA but what country is this that your phone on lap not touching is illegal enough to lose your license for 5 months. Plus you did it several times and didn't know it was illegal? Didn't you get a ticket or notice. This whole thing is missing a piece of the puzzle.", "I didn't check my mail for 3 weeks, I opened my mail on Saturday to 4 fines and still have yet to receive the notice that I can't drive - but I know the points I racked up equals 5 months suspension so I don't want to risk driving.", "Honey, it doesn't matter how pissed he is, he *never* has a reason to treat you this way.\n\nLove doesn't have to be like this. \n\nYou told him to stop and he kept going. What are the consequences for him treating you this way? A good therapist can help you set healthy boundaries around how you deserve to be treated in all of your relationships. \n\nIf you are paying the bill *he has nothing to complain about*.\n\nPlease be kind to yourself. You made a few mistakes, you are owning it. There's no shame in that.", "with camera ticketing, you rack up multiple offences before finding out about the first, so you can immediately go from zero points to suspended license\n\nwhich is apparently what it happened in this case per the edits\n\nphone holder breaks, OP doesn't immediately replace it and leaves phone on lap instead, gets picked up by cameras multiple times, by the time they get the first citation in the mail, they've already gotten at least a second one", "Thank you. Looking forward to my therapy session on Friday \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "If phone holder breaks stick it in the glove box, or door storage etc,  any place but on your person", "sure, absolutely wrong decision to make, and a bad mistake\n\nbut it's also to see how that single mistake can end up with a suspended licence  \n\nthough also pretty sure you can't follow maps from inside the glovebox lmao"]}
