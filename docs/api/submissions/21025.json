Here's the thing: my suimono recipe is pretty simple and includes kombu/katsuobushi dashi, salt, soy sauce, mirin, sake, green onions, wakame, and mushrooms.  We had a good time, but apparently when my niece got home, she told her parents that she \"had alcohol.\"  And now my sister-in-law is pissy because I gave her child alcohol even though I use ONE TABLESPOON of sake per batch of suimono (16 ounces, so two servings).  The girl literally consumed half a tablespoon of sake.  That's not enough to matter at all.\n\nMy brother sees my perspective but is asking me to apologize just to get this to blow over, but I don't think I should have to.  It's not my fault that his wife is uncultured and doesn't understand that a small amount of sake is integral to the flavor of suimono.  I so badly want to be like, \"Fine, next time I'll give her frozen chicken nuggets and Kraft macaroni and cheese.

Sake is essential to Japanese cooking.  Surely you wouldn't suggest that I could just leave out the salt or the shoyu \"to little ill effect\"?  This attitude reminds me of the people who claim to make \"miso soup\" by adding miso to water.  That's not miso soup.  It's just miso water (and sounds awful).
