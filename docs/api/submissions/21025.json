I don't have kids (and honestly don't particularly like them lol), but my brother and sister-in-law have a nine-year-old girl.

This was the menu:\n\n- Tuna tataki with homemade tataki sauce\n- Blanched bok choy seasoned simply with salt, sesame oil, and sesame seeds\n- White rice\n- Ajitsuke tamago\n- Suimono\n- Tsukemono (aokappa specifically)\n- Sencha\n\nI prepared the ajitsuke tamago the day before (since they have to marinate for 24 hours), and I used store-bought aokappa (since ain't nobody got time for that), but we made everything else from scratch together.  Here's the thing: my suimono recipe is pretty simple and includes kombu/katsuobushi dashi, salt, soy sauce, mirin, sake, green onions, wakame, and mushrooms.  We had a good time, but apparently when my niece got home, she told her parents that she \"had alcohol.\"  And now my sister-in-law is pissy because I gave her child alcohol even though I use ONE TABLESPOON of sake per batch of suimono (16 ounces, so two servings).  The girl literally consumed half a tablespoon of sake.  That's not enough to matter at all.\n\nMy brother sees my perspective but is asking me to apologize just to get this to blow over, but I don't think I should have to.  It's not my fault that his wife is uncultured and doesn't understand that a small amount of sake is integral to the flavor of suimono.  I so badly want to be like, \"Fine, next time I'll give her frozen chicken nuggets and Kraft macaroni and cheese.

Sake is essential to Japanese cooking.  Surely you wouldn't suggest that I could just leave out the salt or the shoyu \"to little ill effect\"?  This attitude reminds me of the people who claim to make \"miso soup\" by adding miso to water.  That's not miso soup.  It's just miso water (and sounds awful).

I personally don't use alcohol when cooking for my kids", "To me it read like \"yellow fever\" and made me cringe a lot", "And yet in these cultures people are generally healthier and they live longer.", "Cooking sake is about 13% alcohol, less than drinking sake. One tablespoon of 13% is (in my opinion) a negligible amount of alcohol, it\u2019s a gram or two.", "that\u2019s hardly any. i was having mouthfuls of wine and beer at nine so i wouldn\u2019t have it when i was older.", "I'm pretty certain that OP is American, as am I.  Culturally, the American taboo about children and alcohol is overly harsh and counter-productive, no doubt. OP rates a YTA for her passive-aggressive disregard for her SIL's right to oppose her child having the dish, regardless of whether it actually harmed the child.  So many things in her post make it clear that OP looks down on her SIL, it's clear that she'd rather gnaw off her own arm than to simply say, \"I'm very sorry that giving Niece a dish with a little alcohol in it has upset you so much.  I honestly didn't think that there was any harm in it.  I promise I will never serve her alcohol again, in food or otherwise.\"", "Yeah, she took it waaay tooo personal for some reason. It is simply about a mother taking care of her child - even if you object to her claim about the harmfulness of alcohol in these small amounts - and not about her.", "Are you saying Americans wouldn\u2019t serve a 9 yo Coq au Vin or a proper B\u0153uf bourguignon also or is it just Asian cooking that is taboo?"]}
