I don't have kids (and honestly don't particularly like them lol), but my brother and sister-in-law have a nine-year-old girl.  Once every three or four months she comes over to my apartment for a \"sleepover.\"  Usually we'll get something to eat, watch TV, play with my cat, and then go to the aquarium or something before I drop her back off at my brother's trailer the next day.\n\nLately she's been getting into anime, so we came up with the idea to make a reasonably authentic Japanese meal together.  This was the menu:\n\n- Tuna tataki with homemade tataki sauce\n- Blanched bok choy seasoned simply with salt, sesame oil, and sesame seeds\n- White rice\n- Ajitsuke tamago\n- Suimono\n- Tsukemono (aokappa specifically)\n- Sencha\n\nI prepared the ajitsuke tamago the day before (since they have to marinate for 24 hours), and I used store-bought aokappa (since ain't nobody got time for that), but we made everything else from scratch together.  Here's the thing: my suimono recipe is pretty simple and includes kombu/katsuobushi dashi, salt, soy sauce, mirin, sake, green onions, wakame, and mushrooms.  We had a good time, but apparently when my niece got home, she told her parents that she \"had alcohol.\"  And now my sister-in-law is pissy because I gave her child alcohol even though I use ONE TABLESPOON of sake per batch of suimono (16 ounces, so two servings).  The girl literally consumed half a tablespoon of sake.  That's not enough to matter at all.\n\nMy brother sees my perspective but is asking me to apologize just to get this to blow over, but I don't think I should have to.  It's not my fault that his wife is uncultured and doesn't understand that a small amount of sake is integral to the flavor of suimono.  I so badly want to be like, \"Fine, next time I'll give her frozen chicken nuggets and Kraft macaroni and cheese.  I'm sure she'll be used to that,\" but I know better than to make the situation even worse.

The problem is serving food containing alcohol to other people's children.  If the parents object, then yeah, you shouldn't do it.", "Common misconception I\u2019m afraid. Alcohol does not always cook out of dishes. Only dishes that simmer for a very long time (3+ hours) or dishes where flame is directly applied into the dish. However, the amount of alcohol added to this recipe is insignificant.", "Yeah the first 2/3 of the post was nice -- a thoughtful sleepover setup for a niece by an obvious foodie, cute.  Then it turned into a weird judgy rant against the SIL.  OP should apologize just to learn some humility.", "> Oh, and mirin is also alcohol, so she actually got more than half a teaspoon.\n\nI usually just use Kikkoman's aji-mirin because hon-mirin is so difficult to find in the United States.  It technically contains alcohol, but the alcohol content is so low that the product is not legally regulated as alcohol (like sake is).  You can buy it off the shelf in the grocery store without showing an ID.", "> And you could have omitted it from the sauce to little ill effect.\n\nYou're entitled to your opinion thinking I'm an asshole, but this is just incorrect.  Sake is essential to Japanese cooking.  Surely you wouldn't suggest that I could just leave out the salt or the shoyu \"to little ill effect\"?  This attitude reminds me of the people who claim to make \"miso soup\" by adding miso to water.  That's not miso soup.  It's just miso water (and sounds awful).  Miso soup, by definition, starts with dashi.\n\nAlso suimono is a soup, not a sauce.", "Yeah,right? Did you notice she made sure to mention she drops her off to her brother\u2019s trailer?", "It breaks down to lightly seared tuna, ramen eggs, a clear soup and some pickled vegetables. Plus some tea, rice and seasoned bok choy. If I\u2019m recognising the items properly. It\u2019s a pretty nice mix of foods to make a fairly average set meal, which might have been OP\u2019s aim depending on the anime their niece is into. \n\nBut OP isn\u2019t helping her case with the way she handled it.", "There is a level of ignorance here on the SILs part though.

It\u2019s traditional.  And again\u2026it could have been omitted.  \n\nBut you could also have chosen a plethora of other dishes that didn\u2019t include it, or discussed the ingredient with her parents beforehand.  It was unnecessary to feed sake to a nine year old.", "True, or she could intentionally be being disingenuous. I'm sure you're right, but I think there's probably a lot going on that OP hasn't told us, or gave a biased account of.", "Sake is added to Suimono after it is cooked.", "well then there\u2019s a little alcohol", "Correct.  And the mother objected to it afterward because she didn't realize that she had to give the explicit directive, \"Please do not give my 9 year old child even a little bit of alcohol\" beforehand.  Silly her.", "could also be a cultural thing, im australian and drinking is super common, not necessarily for a nine year old but most people i know wouldn\u2019t object heavily to it"]}
