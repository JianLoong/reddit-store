On weekends we might get a line, but nothing too bad. I was made a manager recently and was given a pay raise. As a manager I don\u2019t have many extra responsibilities, I really am just there to train, direct and answer questions. But with my new position I got a pay raise, I am currently getting $13/hr + tips (most nights will make about $17/hr after tips).

Recently we had a pretty hectic night, once it was over we all crowded the tip jar, and we had all made some really good cash, $20 each. I divided it all up and gave everyone a 20, and I took four fives. I was just about to leave to start to clean when my co-worker gave me a dead stare and told me that they could really use my tips. He then proceeded to say \u201cdo you really even need that,\u201d while tugging at my 5\u2019s. I guess he felt like they should all get my 5\u2019s and I should walk away with nothing. Keep in mind I took the manager position because of the pay PLUS tips, I\u2019m not exempt from them because I make more now. I also have been working at the store for well over a year, and I was helping them serve customers all night. \nOn some dead nights we will only have 2 people in the store, and even if we make just $10 in tips in a few hours I will still split it evenly. I\u2019m saving for college and doing the same work as everyone else so I feel deserving of equal tips.
