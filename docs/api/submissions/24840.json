I just feel really suffocated by my wife's best friend presence at this point, but whenever I try to bring it up with my wife she complains that I'm acting toxic by wanting to make her cut her best friend from he life, even tho that's not what I want at all, I just don't want to be made to feel like I'm third-wheeling them all the time.\n\nI told my wife that it's unfair that she keeps choosing her best friend over me for all of the things related to our baby which ended up with another argument between us where once again she's had her best friend backing her up by saying that I'm acting overly possessive of my wife and she's allowed to make her own decisions on she wants to accompany her while she's giving birth and it ended up with me sleeping on the couch that night.

That's a really difficult sentence to say, especially as a bi woman, long since happily married to a man and who has kids, because I don't like insinuating that someone would be this manipulative because of their sexuality but....

You can be an ally while also recognizing that she\u2019s being a shitty partner.", "sounds like a lot of trouble when the husband is right there", "Elsewhere on this post, there is yet another bigoted piece of work blaming OP for not taking the initiative to decorate the baby's room on his own when he cited it as something his wife cut him out on.\n\nApart from this being near physically impossible when he's working full time to support himself, his wife, and HER FRIEND, I am 100% certain that same poster would have condemned OP for being controlling had he took charge and done it himself without begging for his wife's approval to proceed.", "My BFF and mom will be with me. My husband would straight up faint. I'm ok with it. But you know what we did? We talked it out and discussed what we each felt ok with.", "exactly.", "Poor Bobo the sperm guy", "I literally just watched that episode", "Aaaah that makes more sense \ud83d\ude05", "OP has been benched for the ENTIRE pregnancy and now he's being excluded from the delivery room. Something is not right here. This is giving off \"OP was used to knock her up and her best friend is actually her girlfriend\" vibes.", "What!?! The guy said he wants to be there for the appointments he wants to be there for the delivery and she is saying \"no\". If he's attempting to be supportive and she's not allowing it well, it kind of contradicts your statement. The only thing talk about he should be more supportive, when he's trying to be more supportive does, is push him to places like Reddit because she won't listen to him. Honestly seems like she wants him as a sperm donor and not much else. She didn't marry her best friend.", "So trying to go to appointments isn't being supportive?\nTrying to take his wife baby clothes shopping isn't being supportive?\nWanting to take care of HER instead of her rent-free friend isn't being supportive?", "Found the ~~GF~~ BF", "This is such a bizarre comment\n\nShe didn't make that child with her girlfriend and if she wanted to I think OP needs to know so he can check out of this marriage already\n\nIf she doesn't want to tell OP why she would choose her friend over her husband then she can plain tell him \"you are not husband material, I do not trust you even though you should be the #1 and not some random friend\"\n\nI would absolutely consider divorce if this continues. What's this and how tf would it ever be ok for your spouse to say she trusts you less than her friend while continuing to be married.\n\nIf wife wants to not be alone or wants a financial net and otherwise she discards her husband when he doesn't suit her needs then absolutely a dealbreaker\n\nOP this is not normal. Do not let it go on this way", "Right and a relationship is a partnership. \n\nA partnership the wife has been sharing with her best friend, not her *actual husband.*\n\nYou seem as mentally unwell as this wife/GF are you involved here?", "The same way anything happens in court, the judge makes a ruling and it is so. How do you suppose one night stands have to deal with custody battles years later when the kids already like 5? Daddy didn't sign those birth certificates, but he's still able to get rights once paternity is established. OP is most likely going to be getting papers soon by the sounds of it, so he should prepare himself to not be screwed outright. If say he's not in the hospital, and instead somewhere with cameras, and a way to track his whereabouts like credit receipts to prove he's not in the hospital, if anyone signs his name on the certificate, that constitutes fraud. If the wife of wife's bestie signs the certificate in his.names, that can then be consider fraud to defraud, as it could cause him to be affected financially. Which means someone could face jail time if a lawsuit happens.", "Well then you say, \"here, let's decorate the nursery together today. We'll go shopping and choose the things\". Not, \"oh you decorated the nursery? Why didn't you guess that I wanted to do that at some point?\". Sometimes you need to be slightly assertive to let people know that you are interested and want to be involved.

He doesn't have to watch the birth (no one does except the doctor/nurse)", "Why is this all about him not doing the right thing? When does she bear any responsibility in this?", "I didnt see where he waited to say something until after the nursery was decorated...was that in a comment? If that is what happened, I agree that just waiting til everything is done to say something is on him.\n\nI only see in his post where he told her he would like to go shopping for baby things with her, and she told him no, because thats a job for women and he wouldnt like it. That shes excluding him from any shopping for the baby because..thats for women, as an excuse to do everything with her BF, and doesnt want him involved, thats 100% on her.", "He tried multiple times to talk and still he is doing it wrong? What?", "yeah no argument there", "Any blood makes him ill. Seeing a nurse or doctor with blood on their hands won't be good. I don't mind him not being in the room.", "That's what I did. It was me and her mother with her and I stayed away from the icky stuff.", "Because this sub is incapable of putting any responsibility on a wife. Gender bias", "Because he's either not admitting he's being a deadbeat or she's a lesbian and none of the given information provided so far tell us which."]}
