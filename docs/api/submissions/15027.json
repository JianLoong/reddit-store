I rescued them from a puppy mill that was shut down about 6 months. They were all in horrible condition and had numerous medical issues. They are very friendly dogs and have adjusted to their new lives extremely well. My now SIL, \u201cAmy\u201d, has met them a few times before the events occurred. Amy said she wanted them to be her ring bearer and flower girls for her wedding. Amy and I don\u2019t get along at all. She has said numerous hurtful and cruel things about me to my family and really anybody who will listen. I am not even invited to the wedding as I would \u201cruin the vibe\u201d. I told her she would not be using my dogs for her wedding for multiple reasons including me not being invited and they were all have surgery a few days prior. They were all getting spayed as well as dental work. She wasn\u2019t happy about being told no. \n\nNow to the event that happened a couple weeks ago. All of my dogs had their surgeries on a Thursday. The wedding was on a Sunday in the evening. My husband and I left the house to go run some errands Sunday morning and the dogs were home asleep. I got a notification on my phone about motion at my back door. I check it and it is Amy opening the door and walking into the house. I started panicking and telling my husband we need to leave now and go back to the house. I show him the video and he agrees. I start calling my brother and demanding for him to get his wife out of my house and if she leaves with my dogs I will call the police. He hung up on me. I got home and all of my dogs are gone and their cones were left in their crates. I called the police for theft and breaking and entering.\n\nThe police arrived and I showed them the video of her getting into our house and leaving with the dogs. I told them where her venue was as I had seen a copy of the invitation. The police made it to the venue and were able to locate all of my dogs. One had opened her stitches and was bleeding from the wound. My husband rushed her to an emergency vet to get the stitches closed. Amy was arrested in the middle of getting ready for her wedding and has been charged with a class 1 felony and a few misdemeanors. \n\nNow everybody is saying I ruined the wedding and I overreacted to the entire situation. I am also being told that I need to pay them back for the wedding since it never happened. I am refusing to pay anybody back as well as drop the charges.", "created_utc": 1681745981, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12plw7t/aita_for_getting_my_sil_arrested_on_her_wedding/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They can take you to court to attempt to recover the lost costs of the wedding, but I doubt that will do them any good, because of  the charges against her, and you needing to take one of the dogs to the emergency vet.", "NTA she should pay for the emergency vet adventure too", "Hoy crap your SIL sounds bat shit crazy.. NTA!! She brought all this on herself when as a full grown adult she couldn't accept the word no. I kinda think it's hilarious she was arrested right before the vows lol", "This is one of the wildest wedding related posts I\u2019ve ever seen on Reddit. Damn.\n\nNTA \n\nShe cray cray and ruined her own wedding by being a thief.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t ruin the wedding. She did. Don\u2019t drop the charges. Get a restraining order and go no contact. What a vile person she is and the whole family doesn\u2019t seem much better if they think breaking and entering and theft is okay", "NTA:\n\nShe stole your dogs. She ruined her day by being a thief.", "NTA\n\nShe had no right to enter your home about take those dogs. What an asshat of a SIL! Animal abuse is no laughing matter. She can kick rocks and so can the people saying you ruined the wedding. No, her impulsive and careless decisions did.", "NTA. What she did was more than an AH move. Not inviting you but expecting you to give your dogs to her for the day. Then stealing them. She deserved to be arrested and her big day ruined. \n\nBest go no contact with her after that. And tell everyone who wants to talk to you about that, that you are not gona talk about it. Point.", "NTA. She broke into your house and stole your dogs after you explicitly said no. It's a crime and if anything was ruined, it was because of her. She's the massive a-hole here. Not you. And you shouldn't drop the charges. She could have killed your dogs and deserves whatever comes to her. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "NTA - This is crazy AF! Who the hell thinks it's okay to STEAL DOGS! I don't care if it's for their wedding. You said no, the dogs were in distress from recent surgery. This is insane. I hope she's been charged with endangering an animal. And IMO she owes YOU for the emergency vet bill. You owe her NOTHING. She chose to unlawfully enter your house and steal your dogs. F around, find out!", "NTA. I would also consider your family. If they won't let you explain your side and realize that you are in the right, you need to consider going NC. They are taking a stranger's side and have for a while, it seems. You don't need that negativity for protecting your dogs.", "What an incredibly stupid thing for Amy to do.  Frankly, she did it to spite you and her act of spite blew up in her face BIG TIME.  I hope you stand firm with the criminal charges and with your totally justified refusal to give her a penny for the wedding.  \n\nAs others have said, NTA.", "Dude are you serious? NTA and for the love of god do NOT drop the charges. That\u2019s entitlement on a whole \u2018nother level. Pets are not fking props.", "NTA. \n\nYou even called your brother you\u2019d have her arrested. He didn\u2019t care. \n\nFuck around and find out.\n\nI hope your dogs recovered ok.", "NTA. Your dogs needed to go to an emergency vet.  Serious harm was done by Amy, and she is facing the consequences of her choices.", "NTA and good for you! She put your dogs in serious danger of infection or blood loss. Plus she broke into your house. I hope she gets jail time and pays for your vet bills. Don\u2019t back down. You\u2019re not in the wrong here.", "NTA she kidnapped your STILL HEALING pets for her own selfish wants and needs. Do NOT drop the charges, teach her her actions have consequences.", "NTA. SHE ruined her own wedding by committing a crime just before it. Stupid games, stupid prizes. Please get a restraining order against this lunatic.", "NTA holy shit.  SIL's wedding was ruined but that's 100% her fault.\n\nAlso how did she expect to take your dogs without permission and have them perform roles for her wedding?  I don't think the dogs would have done what her delusional mind was picturing.", "NTA\n\nAnd animal abuse should be added to those charges.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Make sure when you go to court you ask for ALL of the emergency vet bills to be covered by her as well since it was her doing! Jesum crow I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with that. You are NOT overreacting!!", "Not only did she steal your dogs and break into your home, but one of your dogs opened their stitches and needed immediate medical attention.

Please throw the book at her for breaking and entering and theft.", "I\u2019ll take things that never happened for 500.", "NTA - That's breaking and entering and that's on her. You don't owe anyone anything. I'm not usually an advocate of calling the cops in most situations but had you decided to just go get them back, you would have been met with resistance.", "NTA. You don't get to not invite someone to the wedding because they might \"ruin the vibe,\" but then use their dogs in the wedding ceremony. She broke into your house. She invaded your privacy, and stole your dogs. You had no idea if or when she would return the dogs, and one of them needed urgent medical care. Were you supposed to let her get married and then have her arrested?", "Holy shit.  You're a hero, not an asshole.  Big NTA.\n\nI'm glad your pups are safe, I'm amused that the wedding didn't happen, and I'm sorry you're surrounded by apparently insane morons.", "NTA! You did not ruin her wedding. SHE did. You acted completed appropriately and law enforcement agrees with you.\n\nHoping all your pups are OK.", "\" I am also being told that I need to pay them back for the wedding since it never happened.\"\n\nLOL.

She is clearly unhinged. Anyone who is criticizing you is not worth keeping in your life, honestly. I\u2019m so sorry you are dealing with this mess.", "NTA, she broke the law and got arrested for it, not your problem.  Never pay them a dime.", "Hardcore, and I cannot state this loudly enough, NTA. \nI hope Amy gets the worst possible sentence for each charge and that she has to pay back damages as well. \nChange all your locks to avoid any crazy family members trying to retaliate though because it sounds like your brother and other family members condoned what she did.", "NTA - poor dogos! That is such a sad story! I hope the judge is a dog lover.amd I hope you took pictures of the open wounds. How can someone be so selfish and heartless. They had cones on for a reason!", "I don't think I've ever seen an easier NTA ever", "She should be charged with cruelty to animals time three, as well.", "no way you\u2019re the AH here. you deliberately told her no and she basically made it obvious that she doesn\u2019t care about the health and wellbeing of your dogs.", "So cray cray she ruined her wedding day day!", "I wasn\u2019t invited to the wedding so I think she believed I would just throw my hands up and not do anything.", "No. It's downright psychotic to go take someone's dogs to put in your own wedding after being told no.", "How is OP the AH?! The bride didn't even care about the health of the animals! She removed the cones causing one of the dogs to reopen its stitches.", "I dunno, this isn't the wildest Bridezilla story I've ever heard.", "If anything SiL owes OP money for the cost of the emergency vet visit, those aren\u2019t cheap!", "Make sure you change your locks, don\u2019t just take keys back. Someone this unhinged could have made copies.", "I guess, but seriously, the bride, on the day of her wedding, waited outside OP\u2019s house, in the off chance that they would leave, before the wedding and the door just happened to be open.\n\nI don\u2019t know, seems very far-fetched.", "Agreed. The OP should definitely take them to small claims court and get their money for the vet.", "Our errand day is Sunday.
