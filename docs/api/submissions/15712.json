It's small but good for two people just starting.

I currently pay 80% of the the bills in the house. I suggested he at least put money towards the groceries as adding another adult will change the weekly budget. He then lets me know his friends 4 kids will be coming to stay (mind you in our small two bedroom town house) every other weekend. I explained to my boyfriend this greatly impacts our privacy. I explained as a nurse working 12-16 hours days I like to come home and rest. I also value my home being a quiet place to relax. I also want to add his friend is not homeless he does have a place with roommates he just doesn't like them. He also makes more money then I do.

You need to sit your boyfriend down and have a serious discussion about this.", "NTA and wtf. Your bf only pays 20% of everything and thinks he can unilaterally decide this? No just no .

Your boyfriend just feels so entitled to the resources you provide that the money factor doesn't even phase him. He clearly has no respect for that or your personal space & need to rest.

Obviously it's nice to help out your friend who's going through a rough patch, but if you're paying 80% of the bills then it's basically your house. The fact that your boyfriend didn't even think to ask you before telling his friend that he could move in and have his 4 kids(!!!!) stay every weekend is insane. And his friend isn't even going through a rough patch! He could get a motel or something if things are that unbearable at home, or at least offer to pay half your rent since he'd be taking up half the house.\n\nAlso, if your boyfriend's friend thinks that one bedroom in a 2 bedroom townhouse is a suitable place to house his 4 children on a regular basis, then he probably shouldn't have any custody of them.

Yikes.", "NTA, I don't know how you managed to not laugh at his face. I'd put my foot down on that. The idea of his friend plus 4 children to move in is alreday crazy, the fact that he didn't even bother to talk to you beforehand is even worse.

I used to share a home with a friend who highly valued being \u201cthe nice one\u201d to the point she also clung to and even seemed to court being taken advantage of and victimized by people. I\u2019d have to fight to draw safe and sane boundaries around our living situation, for which she\u2019d lash out at me for being mean, intimidating, heartless, and too strong of a personality. It took me way too many years to quit that friendship, and by the end I spent the first 6 months living alone in my own new place just licking my wounds and spending some alone time trying to get myself back right.\n\n Because the people we love and are closest too hold up a mirror we see ourselves reflected in, and if there\u2019s a warped mirror we look into too much it can tend to erode our sense of self. We can start to believe the negative things they say despite ourselves, like your boyfriend calling you selfish. \n\nYou are not selfish and you should not be on the defensive in this situation. You pay the lion\u2019s share of expenses. You live there, and he can\u2019t invite someone to move in without even consulting you. Add in the 4 kids and paying no rent and it\u2019s completely absurd. You are the one who is not only showing common sense and objectivity about the situation, but you\u2019ve been disrespected by the fact he didn\u2019t even ask, and now he\u2019s insulting you too? \n\nScrew him, honey. He is totally out of line, and you should not let his friend move in. You know you shouldn\u2019t. The question is really do you also need to kick your boyfriend to the curb too.", "I got hung up on the fact this man is making you pay 80% despite him making more???? I would have kicked him out for that first, the disrespect from that alone is enough. But then has the audacity to walk all over you even more and invite a whole family to your house? F that. Grow some respect for yourself and kick the boyfriend out or go find a new place and your hopefully ex can have his friend move in with him then. \n\nNTA.\n\nBut you would be if you stayed with a man that clearly has no respect for you.", "Wow, he didn\u2019t talk to you first?  That sets a really bad precedent.  I\u2019d also consider that letting the friend move in without something in writing could mean you may need to evict him later if he doesn\u2019t want to leave. In addition to the kids and all the rest. NTA", "Definitely NTA from your other posts it seems like your bf is seriously taking advantage of you. Find your own place, it's not your fault if that makes his life difficult, you don't owe him a relationship just to make his life easier.", "This isn\u2019t a healthy relationship. Does he always override your boundaries? This a huge decision to allow someone and kids to live in your home. It\u2019s a sweet deal for the friend, so what motivation does he have to leave if he contributes nothing?\n\nGive people a cushy deal and nine times out of ten they will take advantage. Then you\u2019re looking at having to evict them. \n\nIf I were you I would move out and let the boyfriend and his friend split rent and all the other crap.
