It's small but good for two people just starting. After I got home from work today my boyfriend lets me know he told his friend it's okay for him to move in until \"he gets back on his feet\" he also let me know he told his friend he didn't have to pay anything towards bills. I currently pay 80% of the the bills in the house. I suggested he at least put money towards the groceries as adding another adult will change the weekly budget. He then lets me know his friends 4 kids will be coming to stay (mind you in our small two bedroom town house) every other weekend. I explained to my boyfriend this greatly impacts our privacy. I explained as a nurse working 12-16 hours days I like to come home and rest. I also value my home being a quiet place to relax. I also want to add his friend is not homeless he does have a place with roommates he just doesn't like them. He also makes more money then I do. So AITAH for not wanting him and his kids (part time) to move into our place.\n\n\nUPDATE- I have read all your comments. I know I\u2019m a horrible people pleaser and my love language is to take care of people and often times it\u2019s taken advance of. I currently live 5.5 hours away from my family and didn\u2019t want them to worry by telling them what was going on. I decided last night to call my sister and mom. I decided it\u2019s a blessing he found someone to move in because he has someone to help him pay bills (my moms words) so I can move out and not feel guilty he could end up homeless. I found a friend to stay with for my two weeks I\u2019m going to put in at work then I\u2019m going to be moving home. My parents are more then happy for me to come back for the time being. At one point it was hard to leave because EVERYTHING was in my name (hydro, water, internet) everything had to be paid off before I was able to take my name off of these. Believe me I\u2019ve tried to leave more then once but being 5.5 hours away from your friends and family makes it hard to ask for help because you don\u2019t want them to worry. My mom and Dad are going to help me get everything taken out of my name (I know I\u2019m an adult but the only other place I rented was all included so I have no idea how to get my name off of things but no time like the present to learn)", "created_utc": 1682501860, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12zc8sz/aitah_for_saying_no_to_my_boyfriends_friend/", "score": 3733, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It took me way too many years to quit that friendship, and by the end I spent the first 6 months living alone in my own new place just licking my wounds and spending some alone time trying to get myself back right.\n\n Because the people we love and are closest too hold up a mirror we see ourselves reflected in, and if there\u2019s a warped mirror we look into too much it can tend to erode our sense of self.

You are the one who is not only showing common sense and objectivity about the situation, but you\u2019ve been disrespected by the fact he didn\u2019t even ask, and now he\u2019s insulting you too? \n\nScrew him, honey.

That sets a really bad precedent.  I\u2019d also consider that letting the friend move in without something in writing could mean you may need to evict him later if he doesn\u2019t want to leave. In addition to the kids and all the rest. NTA", "Definitely NTA from your other posts it seems like your bf is seriously taking advantage of you. Find your own place, it's not your fault if that makes his life difficult, you don't owe him a relationship just to make his life easier.", "This isn\u2019t a healthy relationship. Does he always override your boundaries? This a huge decision to allow someone and kids to live in your home. It\u2019s a sweet deal for the friend, so what motivation does he have to leave if he contributes nothing?\n\nGive people a cushy deal and nine times out of ten they will take advantage. Then you\u2019re looking at having to evict them. \n\nIf I were you I would move out and let the boyfriend and his friend split rent and all the other crap.

He has made you move, pay almost all expenses for him AND his kids, work yourself to the ground, drop out of college, take out credit card loans in only your name, he's not respecting your sexual boundaries and you are often worried about setting off his anger.

Not just his and his kids things.\"\n\n\"Lately, I realize I\u2019m not important to him. The only thing that makes him care for me is that I pay for everything. He pays HALF the rent and I pay for everything else for him as well as his two children. He never says thank you. I get up every morning to make him a coffee before he leaves for work and still no thank you. This morning I woke up and he wouldn\u2019t even look at me.\"\n\n\"Before I moved away from home to the city to live with him and his kids he told me he was mature paid his bills and I would be able to finish college no problem.

He told me when we moved here the bills needed to be in my name and I did that so when I can\u2019t afford the pull payment on my own my credit is being affected and for the first time since I was 18 I have bad credit from being here. I can\u2019t go out and vent to my friends because he gets upset when I go out, he gets upset if I drive the 2.5 hours to go home and see my mom alone.

She moved in with me, my husband and our son and did not pay anything at first. Then when I put my foot down and told her she had to start paying something because I was watching her kids and buying all the food as well as paying all of our rent and utilities (with husband), she started giving money but then had to borrow it back every time. Come to find out she was just spending all of her money on stuff that she didn't need, like hundreds of dollars in makeup and clothing every month while I was buying her kids school supplies, clothes, shoes and things like that.
