First, the docent said that, though in English we call it a dragon throne, the Chinese just called it a chair, without the \u201cdragon\u201d added on \n\nAside from the fact that I know we in Chinese regularly referred to thrones as \u201cdragon chairs,\u201d there was also a plaque next to the chair with the Chinese characters for \u201cdragon chair\u201d written on it. \n\nI was a bit \ud83d\ude12 but I didn\u2019t say anything to correct her. \n\nHowever, as she kept talking, she then said \n\n\u201cWe believe this was made for the Emperor Qianlong, who reigned for 13 years.\u201d\n\nNow, this emperor is one of the most well-known emperors in Chinese history, and he very famously reigned for *60* years, not 13. His whole thing was that his grandfather had reigned for 61 years, and he had pledged to rule for only 60 out of respect. When 60 years were up, he actually voluntarily abdicated for his son, which was a first in Chinese history. \n\nAll this to say that the number of years he ruled was highly significant to Chinese history. \n\nAt this point, I couldn\u2019t hold my tongue anymore, and piped up and said \n\n\u201c60 years,\u201d thinking she just misspoke. \n\nShe said, \u201csorry what?\u201d\n\nI said \u201cSorry to interrupt, but ruled for 60 years. He didn\u2019t want to surpass his grandfather.\u201d \n\nBut she stood her ground, insisting that she was pretty sure it was 13 years. She even said \n\n\u201cNo, his grandfather ruled for 60 years, not him.\u201d\n\nWe went back and forth for a few more seconds, with her insisting it was 13 years. (We were both very polite and it wasn\u2019t hostile, but it was still a bit tense.)\n\nAt this point I was highly mortified\u2014there were about 10 other people in the tour group all staring at me\u2014so I just smiled awkwardly and apologised profusely for interrupting her and eventually she moved on. \n\nThe whole time my friend was trying very hard not to laugh, and afterwards she said \u201cwell, you were right and she was wrong, so you should have said something.\u201d\n\nBut I could tell I had embarrassed the docent and she (and therefore I) was incredibly uncomfortable for the rest of the tour. \n\nLike, I was right, but it felt very assholey to interrupt her tour and correct her and argue with her, especially in front of other people. I felt like I was disrupting everyone else\u2019s tour as well. But then, we\u2019re all at the museum hoping to learn something right? So they deserved the right info? \n\nSo I see both sides and now idk if I was being TA (and more importantly if I should say something the next time this happens on a tour like this)", "created_utc": 1694643162, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16i0kxi/aita_for_correcting_a_museum_docent/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is her job to know what she's talking about, and she didn't. However, it's not your job to interrupt her and put everyone else on the tour in an awkward situation. Whether the tour is correct does not affect anyone's _enjoyment_ but your own, but making a scene definitely made everyone enjoy the tour less. It's not as if they were going to remember much of the tour anyway. Next time, mention it privately to the docent or her supervisor.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And you should report it to the museum.  If the docent is giving incorrect data.  That looks bad to the institution.  It hurts their reputation.  You were not the AH.

If I was in the crowd and you explained it as you did I would have believed you an appreciated it. That\u2019s a huge jump in years and that would have prob bothered me to the point where I said something. It can go either way.

As long as you did it in a polite and not condescending way I don\u2019t see a problem.

And you make an error. And double down when pointed out. Do you think they will feel justified in correcting or just let your mistake ride?\nYou weren't glory seeking, merely making a polite correction. The docent could have done a \"really? Let me quickly check!\" and then owned her error with a \"my bad\" and it could have made for a much better outcome.

As people learn.  And seeing objects first hand.  Can spark intense curiosity.  They learn the museum is giving false data.  That hurts the institution.  It hurts their reputation.  And may hurt donations.  This person being wrong.  Could hurt a lot of people."]}
