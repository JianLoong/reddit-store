And he has the gall to make fun of your efforts?  After he complains and moans while you do it?  He's totally an AH.\n\nEven barbers go to school for it.  And I guarantee they have to practice a great deal to become good at it.  That skill doesn't just pop into someone's head, full grown, no matter how many Youtube videos you watch on it.", "NTA.

If he's going to grumble and complain while you cut his hair at his insistence, and then laugh along with his parents at your expense, he doesn't deserve your labour. If he doesn't want to pay $30 for a haircut, he can find a place that charges $10 or $20.", "NTA. So he wants to save money but he also wants to rumble bit how long you\u2019re taking and then make fun of the job you did? Time for him to go and get his haircut at the barbershop!", "NTA. I cut my husbands hair but not all the time. I have absolutely no experience cutting hair but thank goodness his is an easy cut. But any time I don\u2019t feel like cutting or really prefer a professional (like for our wedding) he has no objections. Also my lack of skill does end up in a couple rough patches that I\u2019m able to laugh at. Don\u2019t take their joking to heart. You\u2019re not a professional. Just laugh along with them", "NTA\n\nYou may give him a buzz cut, thats a fast and long lasting cut. If he does like not that, then he goes to the barber.", "NTA\n\nI was stuck cutting my partner's hair too for a while and it. Is. Hard!!! He never complained about how long it took, but if he did I would have walked away halfway through and left him with something worth while to laugh at.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Either he's quiet and polite about it or he goes to the hairdresser.", "NAH He\u2019s the one with bad hair. If your husband can find the humour in wearing bad hair just to save $30 so that you don\u2019t have to sacrifice something else\u2026 I would say that he is a keeper\u2026", "NTA", "NTA - Get him to cut his own hair if he complains. I've been cutting my own hair for the last 5 years.", "I mean he's the one that has to live with the haircut. He doesn't seem to be complaining about the result. \n\nIf you're financial situation is indeed grim - I suggest accepting that you're not great at this yet and be ok with a little heating.\n\nNTA", "NTA - How old is he?  He is acting like a toddler by whining about how long it takes. As to the quality, you are not a trained barber, tell him to get a buzz cut and to just be quiet.", "NTA. He can just shave it himself. When my dad didn't want to pay for haircuts he would just shave that shit himself and if the back was uneven let someone else like me or my step mum clean it up a bit. Your husband can just do that and if he can't he can suck it up and go to a hair dresser.", "This made me snort. A most effective solution!", "NTA. Lose the attachments and shave his head.", "INFO:. I have to wonder, though- is this only the latest thing he\u2019s complaining about? Is this typically how he treats you, OP? I\u2019d use this as a lens to really think about his behavior in general and what you\u2019ve been putting up with. If everything else is fine, great! But I have a feeling this is a red flag on a pile of flags.", "NTA \n\nI know this is just a small look into your marriage, but your husband sounds pretty crummy. Whines the entire time you\u2019re doing him a favor and then laughs about your efforts with others. It\u2019s gross.", "NTA. If he won't shell out for a proper cut by a professional then he's going to look weird. And then he makes fun? Not cool. \n\nFull disclosure: I've been cutting my husband's hair since the pandemic started because he was very high risk. He still prefers that I do it, but he doesn't care how it turns out, either. Which is a very good thing.", "Kinda of an asshole but not in the wrong like at the end of the day you can do what you want", "NTA but did you think they were just giving him a hard time and it was really aimed at you.  Not knowing his family, they just may be the way they interact.  Not in a hateful or mean way..unless this is a recurring issue with your in laws, don\u2019t worry so much.  Laugh and give him a hard time about it too!", "Succintly put! Kind of a choice between quality or quantity.", "Agreed, definitely NTA. My husband always wants me to cut his hair but then complains I don\u2019t do it as well as his sister, who is a hairdresser. She literally will cut his hair for free too. I tell him all the time if he wants a proper haircut he\u2019s asking the wrong person; I can barely do my own hair.", "There is no laughing along with them when they were making fun of the job HE wanted her to do and she did the best she could in a call she was not a part of.", "Genius. Op should give him half a haircut then suddenly remember his laughing about it and walk away.", "The man who complains the whole time she's doing FOR HIM something HE wants and then makes fun of her with his family in a call she is not included in is many things, but a keeper is not one of them."]}
