I cut my husbands hair but not all the time. I have absolutely no experience cutting hair but thank goodness his is an easy cut. But any time I don\u2019t feel like cutting or really prefer a professional (like for our wedding) he has no objections.

I've been cutting my own hair for the last 5 years.", "I mean he's the one that has to live with the haircut. He doesn't seem to be complaining about the result. \n\nIf you're financial situation is indeed grim - I suggest accepting that you're not great at this yet and be ok with a little heating.\n\nNTA", "NTA - How old is he?  He is acting like a toddler by whining about how long it takes. As to the quality, you are not a trained barber, tell him to get a buzz cut and to just be quiet.", "NTA. He can just shave it himself. When my dad didn't want to pay for haircuts he would just shave that shit himself and if the back was uneven let someone else like me or my step mum clean it up a bit. Your husband can just do that and if he can't he can suck it up and go to a hair dresser.", "This made me snort. A most effective solution!", "NTA. Lose the attachments and shave his head.", "INFO:. I have to wonder, though- is this only the latest thing he\u2019s complaining about? Is this typically how he treats you, OP? I\u2019d use this as a lens to really think about his behavior in general and what you\u2019ve been putting up with. If everything else is fine, great! But I have a feeling this is a red flag on a pile of flags.", "NTA \n\nI know this is just a small look into your marriage, but your husband sounds pretty crummy. Whines the entire time you\u2019re doing him a favor and then laughs about your efforts with others. It\u2019s gross.", "NTA. If he won't shell out for a proper cut by a professional then he's going to look weird. And then he makes fun? Not cool. \n\nFull disclosure: I've been cutting my husband's hair since the pandemic started because he was very high risk. He still prefers that I do it, but he doesn't care how it turns out, either. Which is a very good thing.", "Kinda of an asshole but not in the wrong like at the end of the day you can do what you want", "NTA but did you think they were just giving him a hard time and it was really aimed at you.  Not knowing his family, they just may be the way they interact.  Not in a hateful or mean way..unless this is a recurring issue with your in laws, don\u2019t worry so much.  Laugh and give him a hard time about it too!", "Succintly put! Kind of a choice between quality or quantity.", "Agreed, definitely NTA. My husband always wants me to cut his hair but then complains I don\u2019t do it as well as his sister, who is a hairdresser. She literally will cut his hair for free too. I tell him all the time if he wants a proper haircut he\u2019s asking the wrong person; I can barely do my own hair.", "There is no laughing along with them when they were making fun of the job HE wanted her to do and she did the best she could in a call she was not a part of.", "Genius. Op should give him half a haircut then suddenly remember his laughing about it and walk away.", "The man who complains the whole time she's doing FOR HIM something HE wants and then makes fun of her with his family in a call she is not included in is many things, but a keeper is not one of them.", "NTA\n\nI get the groaning, I think that's completely understandable. I involuntarily groan at things all the time.\n\nComplaining you're taking too long? Mocking your hard work?\n\nFuck that shit, that's just disrespectful.", "This is so stupid it's not even worth voting on. You both need to grow up, you for not being able to take a joke and him for being such a child he can't sit still for a haircut", "YTA", "NTA.

Husband is, and maybe his parents.\n\nGo to someplace cheaper. Great Clips ain't $30.", "NTA\n\nI don't think you'd be out of line for this at all, and I'd tell him why if he complains about it. He can get a buzzcut if it bothers him that much tbh. \n\nThat strikes me as ungrateful. I commend you for being willing to learn and try for him. That's super dope.", "Nta. Your husband is a piece of work. You're the one doing him a favor, and his response is to laugh and make fun of your work. If he asks again, just shave his head. Maybe he'll stop asking after that.", "NTA.", "NTA. I would never cut his hair again. No matter what.", "Tell him to cut his own hair. It's not actually all that difficult and I find it more reliable than having a friend do it. \n\nThey sell extra long clipper guards online which can help with the top.", "My wife cuts my hair and she's actually quite good.", "For real. During the pandemic, I was in charge of giving my husband a #2 all over and edging him up. It was only SLIGHTLY better than him doing it himself. And so much stress for me\u2026the first time I shaved a sideburn to high. The moment the shops opened, he was back there. Even a $15 cut is better than what I was bringing to the table.", "How?", "He can go to an old school barber, pretty inexpensive and fast but not interesting.  Or he can go have his mommy cut his hair.  I wouldn\u2019t help him either", "I (older F) have been using RoboCut for about 30 years. It ain't pro, but it does me fine and I've gotten quite skilled with it. \n\nAlso: clippers. Buzz it!! or let it grow and grow and grow.

LOL", "When I read that you have your husband a #2, it took me a moment to realize that you were talking about a haircut and not something else. That\u2019s what I get for reading things while sleepy and forgetting the context of the post!", "NTA. I gave my husband a haircut in lockdown and was terrified in case I ruined his hair. It wasn't perfect but I didn't get a word of complaint and he was patient while I took my time to get it as best I could. If your husband can't respect your efforts he can go back to the barber because he isn't worth your time", "NTA.  You are doing him a favor and he is making you the butt of a joke.  You are perfectly fine to set a boundary in this situation because that is not acceptable behavior.  He can cut his own hair Or find someone else to do it.", "NAH\n\nIt sounds like *he* doesn't mind getting a bad haircut, since he found his parents' teasing about it quite funny. I don't think your husband was trying to offend you or hurt your feelings by joking about it with his parents. They've probably had their own similar moments in life.\n\n>the result is not great\n\nYou know that your haircuts aren't great, even though you are really trying. You have two choices: own it and join the joke, or stop cutting his hair. Both are valid, and neither are overreacting.\n\nIt sounds frustrating for you. You obviously really want to do a good job. You try hard, but you get pressured and rushed, the result isn't what you hope for, and then you don't feel appreciated. To add insult to injury, you feel made fun of. \n\nYou sound like an earnest and sweet person.\n\n\"Honey, I don't do a good job cutting your hair, and it bothers me, even if it doesn't both you.\"\n\nOR, you could have a sense of humor about it. \"Yup! I call it rushed wife couture! Rock it, babe. That's what you're getting, or some version of it anyway.\"\n\nThis is my approach. My son hates getting his haircut, so I cut it, but then he has to live with his \"mommy haircut.\" I warn him, but he doesn't mind, lol. He'd rather that than go into a salon.", "Since he whinges, get him to try cutting his own hair, he might actually find it preferable. Instead of a fight I suggest framing it positively - 'you have a go, I'll do the back of your neck and tell you if you missed a bit'.\n\nYou're NTA of course but I do kinda feel like you might choose to interpret this light-heartedly. Mocking people's haircuts is pretty universal in friends and families, doesn't need to be a deadly insult to you.", "NTA - you already made it clear you\u2019re not a pro. He wanted you to anyways. He made fun of you. Just invest in a hair trimmer.", "NAH. Unless there's something going on that wasn't mentioned, most likely there was no maliciousness on part of hubby and family. Though, he needs to grow up about haircuts in general.\n\nThis is what I do. I'm partially bald so YMMV.  I bought electric clippers (they're not expensive and you'd get ROI after two haircuts). I shave my head using a #1 guard and have my wife clean the stragglers. Maybe a variation on this could work.", "NTA\n\nTell him if he insists on you doing it, then you will just shave him bald.  Hard to \"cut\" it uneven that way.", "There are beauty school and barber schools which you can go to for an extremely reduced price.  They are practicing on you but they are supervised and your hair will be checked by a licensed professional.  Way better than your cut regardless.   NTA.", "If he hates it so much why doesn't he just get some clippers and shave it himself? Only takes a couple minutes.\n\nNTA and he's being a jerk", "NTA. I wish my haircuts were only $30. $60-80 for trim for me", "NTA There are tons of videos online that will show a man how to cut his own hair. Send some to him cause you're done. Best news being that it won't be boring at all since he'll actually have to be doing something during it.\n\nThat or do a really bad job on his next haircut. That way everyone can be laughing about it, right?", "NTA. But tell him that his behavior here makes you feel belittled and insulted. He may think this is no big deal at all and might not realize how much his complaining is grating and hurtful.", "He can go to great clips and pay $11-15 and it takes 15 minutes, he can check in online.  It\u2019s that or next time you take it all off.\n\nEdit: forgot verdict \n\nNTA", "Would serve him right if she just shaved a strip down the middle then stopped. Call it the jackass special.", "Yeah, he wants to whine about the quality of the thing you're specifically doing as a favor to save you money, he can find a Super Cuts or a beauty school and have them do it.", "Get him a Flowbee (not sure how to spell it).", "George Clooney has these clippers and cuts his own hair - it came out in an interview years ago.... So, you're in good company :)", "I'm guessing that's because you just let her do her thing instead of complaining about it.", "It\u2019s self-deprecating humour. They were making fun of him not her.", "Must be OP\u2019s husband.", "SMH that this guys whines about boredom. As if his partner has such a shallow life that giving her dude a haircut, which she does not want to do, is the peak of interest for her week.\n\nNTA\n\nThere's no reason to take on a task when it is not appreciated.", "Thank you.  I couldn\u2019t remember the name of those things.", "All good until your dad forgets to oil it and your hair gets twisted in the blades and you cry for an hour while mom tries to untangle it. Definitely hasn't happened to me", "Haha that's probably a big part of it!", "Someone should show him how to watch YouTube or scroll through social media on his phone while he's getting his hair cut. Maybe get him a Rubik's Cube or something. Being bored in this day and age is a very solvable problem most of the time and certainly in this case.", "I completely agree.", "Maybe OP's husband needs a lolly. That always entertained my son when he would fidget around fromm boredom when gettin his hair cut. He was 3 though."]}
