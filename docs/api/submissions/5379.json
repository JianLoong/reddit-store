Because she doesn\u2019t drive, she may not realize how exhausting that may be( as well as dangerous)  Sorry she felt abandoned, but there was no other way for her to reasonably attend.", "NTA. Her point about making \"concessions\" is not valid here. You haven't seen your grandparents in over 7 years and she's asking you to sacrifice over 2 out of 7 days with them to make that horrible drive. And she wouldn't even be helping with the drive at all. This is not a compromise, this is just doing things 100% her way to accommodate her needs.\n\nI agree with the other comments, she needs to get a driver's license or try to address her phobia with therapy. Even if she can't necessarily overcome her flight phobia, she's going to have to come to terms with the fact that not getting on a plane will automatically exclude her from several, if not most, trips.", "NTA. You didn't abandon her. She knew exactly where you were going and when you would be back and I assume you were reachable by phone. Her fears are just that, her's. If she is choosing to not deal with them and get help, then she needs to understand that it's going to limit her ability to do things. You had every right to say no to her road trip request. As someone who has made multiple road trips, being the only driver is exhausting. \n\nAlso her argument of \"Love is about making concessions and helping each other\", well if that's how she feels, why isn't she working on herself and trying to get her license to help lessen the load of you having to drive all the time? \n\nIf relationships are about give and take, sounds like she's taking a lot in this case and not giving it back.", "NTA. Is she seeking some sort of therapy for these phobias? Because it sounds like they're getting worse, and not better. We can all make reasonable accommodations for those we love, and we all have our issues, but asking you to drive 50 hours rather than flying, wow, just no.", "NTA-Phobias are very real and very serious but she needs to realize that some phobias mean you have to give something up if you cannot accommodate the phobia. You not being willing to drive for 50 hours as the solo driver is a great example.", "NTA. That\u2019s a huge ask, and one she shouldn\u2019t make if she\u2019s not willing to share the work. She needs to step up and get her driver\u2019s license if she\u2019s interested in road tripping.", "NTA.  She could get treatment for her phobia and get over it.  I did, and it worked.  Instead, she expects everyone else to go to great lengths to accommodate her problem, which is fixable, but she chooses not to.", "NTA - I have a fear of flying and I happen to love road trips. But 50 hours isn't just exhausting, it's like 4 days of driving. And if you're the only one driving, that just sucks. Love is about compromising, and it seems like your girlfriend wants you to do all the compromising. Don't get me wrong, fear of flying is definitely a thing. I had a severe panic attack the last time someone in my family tried to get me to fly instead of drive. But I do know there are things and methods used to help people with their fear of flying and if I was your girlfriend, I would definitely look into those methods if it was something that was very important to her.", "NTA and you need to consider if this is something you want to deal with longterm. \n\nAt the very least, she needs a license but 25 hours of driving one way  for two people would still be ridiculous. She needs help for her phobia. You love is about making concession but also wanting to be a better person for the one you love- and she should want to try to fix her condition instead of forcing you to drive 50 hours by yourself.", "Nta. She either needs to get her drivers license or get therapy for her fear of planes. Or both", "NTA.   You are allowed to be with your family and not include your girlfriend.  Also 50 hours of driving is insane.  She sounds very selfish.", "NTA\n\nI've made a 15 hour drive a couple times as a solo driver and it was brutal,  a 50 hour drive as a solo driver is a ridiculous and dangerous ask.", "I very rarely recommend people break up. But let me ask you some Qs. You can answer here or just to yourself. \n\nWhere do yoy see your relationship with Emily going?\n\nDo you love being an uber/Lyft driver?\n\nDo you like to travel? If so, would you rather travel with your life partner or always return to a temper tantrum because you went alone?\n\nWhen you GPs die (hopefully many many yrs from now), will you skip the funeral? Drive 50hrs? Or go by yourself? \n\nIf you start a fam with Emily & you have kids. You kids become adults, GO away to college, or move AWAY for work. Will you drive for visits or always expect them to come to you? Let me warn you, even if you pay for it sometimes it's impractical as them being younger, are lower on work vacation totem pole, having &/traveling with young kids is difficult, so sometimes having the older adult(s) travel (in this scenario you & Emily) is the more practical. 9\n\nDo you see where I'm going with this Qs. If you answer yes to any of the above Qs AND you want to stay with Emily, I suggest you two get couples & individual counseling .", "NTA, you driving 50 hours alone is unsafe. and you'd have to book so many hotel rooms so it probably WOULD be more expensive than the flight.\n\nunfortunate situation. does she have any past trauma with planes ? would she consider therapy ?", "NTA\n\nIf she won't work on her fear, this won't be the only time her options are limited.  Her request was not a compromise. It was a huge imposition.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou gave her many different opportunities to join you on the trip and you were given the money to pay for the ticket to bring her as well. Her fears are also valid but making you drive 50 hours just so she could join is a lot. She also has the opportunity to get her license especially if she is not getting it by choice. Maybe next time you all could plan a trip to go together and visit places on the way. She may be upset, but you did give her many many ways to join and she turned them down and basically wanted you to do all the work by driving. I'm sure if it was flipped, she would not want to drive 50 hours either.", "NTA. Even 25 hours each way would still require at least 1-2 overnight stops to properly rest.   Go and see your grandparents, and your gf needs to make realistic choices that don\u2019t fall on you to drive for the entire 50 hours round trip.", "NTA. Love means compromise, in this case hers accepting you will travel alone. BTW, my current BF doesn\u2019t come with me anywhere. It\u2019s mostly because he has limited time due to having custody of his kid. I\u2019ve traveled alone to Italy, Dc, Miami, Hawaii, and lived in Mexico and 1 month in Spain. I was fine with this because we had an annual trip to Cancun but now he doesn\u2019t want to do that either. Traveling can be a dealbreaker in relationships", "YTA, because these times don't add up whatsoever, meaning the drive would actually be much more reasonable than you're willing to admit.  \n\n\nSpeaking in one-way terms: A four hour drive plus two hour flight does not equal a 25 hour total drive. You're saying that two hours of flying equals 21 hours of driving? These number just don't add up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Because she sounds like a completely helpless person.", "Seems about right to me. A flight from Seattle to Pheonix is 2 hours, 45 minutes (about). I made this trip frequently when I was younger. To drive the same distance, it's about 22 hours.", "I could be wrong, but I think where the 12 is coming from is 4 hours there, 4 hours back, which is 8 and then 2 hour plane trip there and 2 hours back, so 4. 8+4=12.\n\nRegardless though, a road trip where you are the sole driver is difficult and exhausting. \n\nThere is potentially the cost of hotels/motels as well, which could significantly increase the cost and not make it more cost effective.", "A couple years ago,  I attended a family reunion near Houston, Texas. I live south and west Dallas/FtWorth,  about a 4 hour drive from aunt's house near Houston. \n\nOn the way out,  I dropped my brother and his wife,  as well as some cousins,  off at the airport. Brother and his wife live in Phoenix,  cousins live near San Diego.

Location,  roads (interstate vs highway vs local),  weather,  vehicle (some vehicles are simply faster and so are some drivers),  etc,  it's entirely possible it could take that long to drive,  especially since he is the only driver and will need frequent breaks.", "Without more information on his whereabouts, we have no idea if they add up or not. It depends on the road, weather and general driving conditions, plus he's the only driver, so you need to factor that in too. In some places, driving 100 miles can take half a day. The fact that the airport is 4 hours away also points towards an infrastructure that is not ideal. But even IF it's not 50 hours and \"only\" 30 to 40 (or whatever it adds up to in your mind), it's still no fun driving it all by yourself, plus he would have lost valuable time with his grandparents he hadn't seen in ages.   \nNTA", "Round trip by plane: 4 hours  by flight and 8 hours by car. \n\nRound trip by car without stopping: 50 hours.", "Yes, but that's a nearly 50% longer flight.\n\nAgain, not trying to nitpick but how long the drive is makes a big difference as to what's a reasonable accommodation for a live-in partner that has a phobia.", "Yeah... that doesn't make sense at all.\n\nIn what world does 42 hours of driving (without stopping even!) equal 4 hours of flying?\n\nUnless you're driving 20 mph or taking a fighter jet, the math isn't mathing.\n\nLike I said, I'm only bringing this up because the drive is likely much more reasonable than you're letting on, which changes the dynamics of this entire post.", "I guess we have different definitions for \"reasonable\", because I would find any drive over 10 hours completely unreasonable compared to flying for a few hours. Add to the fact that she does not have a license, so all of the driving would fall on him. Driving for long periods can be utterly exhausting, and it's not fair to expect that of someone else.", "The drive being reasonable is irrelevant since OP would be the only one driving and they don\u2019t want to do that. They\u2019re not being unreasonable for not wanting to. Even if it was say only a 7 hour drive that could be done in a day, if they don\u2019t want to, they don\u2019t want to.

I don't know how to explain this to her.. maybe just hand over the thread.

Tbh I'd say NTA if she offered to do all the driving, it's just too long in a car.", "NTA honestly I don\u2019t know why you even want to be with this person. This person is so selfish and entitled that they would rather you have less time with your grandparents and drive 50 hours instead of just getting on a plane with you. I guess she has a phobia, but a good person would\u2019ve just said I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t go have fun. She doesn\u2019t care about you. She only cares about herself. I would never, want to stay with someone like this because you won\u2019t be happy. It\u2019s always going to be about her and she is going to try to manipulate you or guilt trip you until you give in and apologize even though you did nothing wrong. It is absolutely insane. She expected you to drive 50 hours. It\u2019s bad enough she didn\u2019t want to fly with you, but she won\u2019t even drive! WTF? Why do you do this to yourself? You deserve so much better.", "NTA. Girlfriend clearly believes her wants/needs are far superior to yours and without consideration. I would thinking carefully about furthering a relationship with this person, will there ever be a time where she will compromise for you? The fact that you spending time with aging grandparents is abandonment because of her unwillingness to compromise. let\u2019s be honest they don\u2019t live forever and are probably in the 3 or 4 quarter of their lives. Don\u2019t see why you going alone wasn\u2019t a option if things couldn\u2019t be considerably fair.", "NTA the world isn't going to conform to get fears.

She apparently doesn\u2019t get it.", "Exactly, a concession would be for her learning how to drive and trying to help op during the trip...", "It\u2019s a 7 day trip. 50 hours one way would be 3 days of driving if OP never needed to stop and rest. \n\nSo OP would get there, have lunch and have to turn around and drive back. Or take 2 weeks off for the trip. \n\nGF is nuts. \nNTA", "I mean even if they did both drive that'd still be a miserable time. Even driving 20 hours a day it's still more than 2 days of just driving... and then they'd have to do it all again on the return. With hotel and gas fees it's probably more expensive than flying. So OP would be paying more to have significantly less time with their grandparents", "The numbers DO add up.  Example: it's about 4 hours from central Ohio to San Antonio via flight with stops then another 1 hour to where my grandparents lived.  So 10 hours round trip.  It's 19.5 hours without stops to drive the same distance.  When we went down for grandparent's funeral during the height of covid we drove.  With stops etc it took us 2 days.  So 12 hours round trip plane/car or 50+ hours driving for OP's trip seems like real numbers to me", "Possibly even longer depending on quality of sleep etc.", "Well she said 50 hours round trip so I assumed over 2 but yeah. She'd be tired AF too. Plus spending the night at hotels. Good point\n\nEDIT: fixed pronouns", "6. \n50 hours one way/24hours in a day =2 days and 2 hours.  That\u2019s going 60 mph the whole time, with no pee breaks, no food or gas stops and no need for sleep and no weather, accident or construction issues. And that\u2019s ONE WAY. \n\nSo rounding up, it\u2019s 3 days each way. On a 7 day trip means 6 of the 7 days would be driving. And that\u2019s IF they don\u2019t get a flat tire or break down and have to stop somewhere and wait for repairs.", "Op said 50 round trip. Still, 25 hours one way is going to require rest at some point. He would end up cutting his visiting time in half. GF is being incredibly selfish. She needs therapy to help with these phobias. \n\nOP, is this what your relationship will always be. She isn't able to visit your family. She isn't able to drive. What steps is she taking to help cope with these phobias? She is expecting you to do all the heavy lifting but not willing to compromise to make it easier for you.

Nobody 'abandoned' her, she's 20 years old, not six. Maybe she should also try researching bus and train timetables so you can travel places together without you having to get exhausted driving.\n\nAlso, if you and Emily or anyone else want to travel to Europe, Asia or elsewhere without flying (I'm guessing you're in the USA), check out 'repositioning cruise'  deals - you can get boat tickets all over the world for a fraction of the normal price.", "NTA. The two of you could absolutely, at some point in the future, have a road trip adventure and build those memories, but it was actually pretty selfish and unreasonable of her to expect you to change the plans to that degree to accommodate her for a trip to see your grandparents. While it's understandable that she might feel left out and disappointed, she was unable to join you because of her phobias and it's her responsibility to come to terms with that. Those so-called \"concessions\" were not reasonable and you did not abandon her - you went on a trip to visit your grandparents that she was unable to join you on because of logistics, that's it.", "NTA. Personally I could not be with someone that doesn't drive by choice (what happens when you have kids and they need to go to appointments sports etc,? Will you have to take time off work all the time? And I get that phobias are real but they can be overcome by getting therapy. My aunt actually got help for her fear of flying just so she could come to my wedding from  Europe to the US. Life is al about choices. It seems like she's made her choices but then expects you to make all the concessions becuse of her choices. That's not how relationships work either.\nAnd if you're at all interested in travel you might as well give up on that idea because she will never let you travel alone from the sounds of if she felt abandoned by you visiting your own damn family you hadn't seen in years. I'd rethink this relationship personally because you're going to be the one inconvenienced all the time by being her personal driver.", "Info: is \"love is about consessions\", then what's she doing to meet you halfway on this?

And if it's around this time of year - it's the winter and that could make the drive longer and potentially a bit hairy.\n\nGF has to realize that her phobia is going to cost her in the way of missed trips (and possibly her career).  She can either accept that or perhaps try getting with a therapist and see if there isn't something she can do to lesson her phobia.", "NTA. She isn't a traveler. She's not willing to get her driver's license or get therapy/Xanax for her flying phobia. That doesn't mean she gets to force her preferences on you or anyone else.

She is right in part, so one of the concessions SHE will have to make is travel.   My SO will NOT fly.  We do occasionally drive @ 1000 miles (one way) to see family, maybe once a year.   In the meantime, I will fly up 2 or 3 other times.  She understands and usually plans a day trip or 2 with friends while I'm gone.

Point still stands that 3 days of driving each way plus hotel costs is a lot.", "NTA why won\u2019t she get a license?", "NTA. But let's be honest here are you ready to be an Uber for the rest of your relationship/life with this person? How does she get to appointments? If you guys decide to have kids and for some reason you're not home, and they need to be rushed to the hospital and an ambulance isn't going to make it in time, how is she going to handle it? I understood not wanting to fly, but she at least needs a license to function as an adult.\n\nAlso not being  able to travel would be a be a deal breaker for most people.", "NTA \n\n>She insisted that love is about making concessions and helping each other\n\nAsk her what concession she would have made for the trip. I'd love to hear the answer. \n\nA 50+ hour car trip is several concessions on **your** part. There's all the driving being your sole responsibility, multiple stops for gas and food, overnight stays at hotels. You'd either put a ton of miles plus other wear and tear on your vehicle or have to rent a car. Plus that would mean less time spent with your grandparents or more PTO used to extend the trip. \n\nI just don't understand how Emily thought this was feasible.", "She hoped she would get a good fight going and you wouldn\u2019t go.", "NTA- I understand her fear but i would hate to spend 50 hrs driving.\n\nHave you considered the Train?

She keeps saying the trip would be a adventure. Maybe for her, as she can sleep, play on her phone, sight see, relax, or whatever else she decides to do while sitting in the passenger seat. Driving, and having to watch where your going and everyone else around you, and getting sleepy and trying to stay awake is not fun or an adventure.\n\nShe is selfish in the regards, that she isn't trying to get over her phobias, nor is she willing to get a driver license to help ease the load, for you.\n\nAnd silent treatment is a childish way to act. If she really wanted to go she would have gotten her ass on the plane, or go a driver license so she could help drive. \n\nI would seriously consider, telling her that she needs to work on getting her license, give her a time limit to get it done, or your going to stop taking her places. Is there are reason other than she just don't want to that she hasn't gotten her license yet?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA, especially considering that she doesn't drive. There are concessions in relationships, but you already make a lot of them when you drive everywhere and it sounds like if this was a reasonable drive you would have considered it.

Was she flying with you? No. Was she offering to get her license so she could share driving? No.  Girl just wanted a road trip with you doing all the work.", "Nta. She had the option to fly. She chose not to.", "I don\u2019t fly anymore, haven\u2019t for about 30 years.  I did air search and rescue for a number of years in the service, and all my good flying karma is used up.  I missed my mothers funeral because of this (before anyone fries me, I went home for a month while she was on home hospice care, and told her I would rather spend my leave talking to her, than crying over her coffin.  She knew I wouldn\u2019t be home for the funeral and didn\u2019t care).\n\nSo any time we plan a visit, it\u2019s drive or take the train.  I\u2019ve told my hubby that he didn\u2019t have to go the slow route with me, and I would meet him there.  I never expect ANYONE  to accommodate my not flying.  Because it\u2019s a me problem.

I wish I could experience what these people feel.
