The plane trip is 4 hours to the airport + 2 hours of flight, so 12 hours of travel.

Because she doesn\u2019t drive, she may not realize how exhausting that may be( as well as dangerous)  Sorry she felt abandoned, but there was no other way for her to reasonably attend.", "NTA. Her point about making \"concessions\" is not valid here. You haven't seen your grandparents in over 7 years and she's asking you to sacrifice over 2 out of 7 days with them to make that horrible drive. And she wouldn't even be helping with the drive at all. This is not a compromise, this is just doing things 100% her way to accommodate her needs.\n\nI agree with the other comments, she needs to get a driver's license or try to address her phobia with therapy. Even if she can't necessarily overcome her flight phobia, she's going to have to come to terms with the fact that not getting on a plane will automatically exclude her from several, if not most, trips.", "NTA. You didn't abandon her. She knew exactly where you were going and when you would be back and I assume you were reachable by phone. Her fears are just that, her's. If she is choosing to not deal with them and get help, then she needs to understand that it's going to limit her ability to do things. You had every right to say no to her road trip request. As someone who has made multiple road trips, being the only driver is exhausting. \n\nAlso her argument of \"Love is about making concessions and helping each other\", well if that's how she feels, why isn't she working on herself and trying to get her license to help lessen the load of you having to drive all the time? \n\nIf relationships are about give and take, sounds like she's taking a lot in this case and not giving it back.", "NTA. Is she seeking some sort of therapy for these phobias? Because it sounds like they're getting worse, and not better. We can all make reasonable accommodations for those we love, and we all have our issues, but asking you to drive 50 hours rather than flying, wow, just no.", "NTA-Phobias are very real and very serious but she needs to realize that some phobias mean you have to give something up if you cannot accommodate the phobia. You not being willing to drive for 50 hours as the solo driver is a great example.", "NTA. That\u2019s a huge ask, and one she shouldn\u2019t make if she\u2019s not willing to share the work. She needs to step up and get her driver\u2019s license if she\u2019s interested in road tripping.", "NTA.  She could get treatment for her phobia and get over it.  I did, and it worked.  Instead, she expects everyone else to go to great lengths to accommodate her problem, which is fixable, but she chooses not to.", "NTA - I have a fear of flying and I happen to love road trips. But 50 hours isn't just exhausting, it's like 4 days of driving. And if you're the only one driving, that just sucks. Love is about compromising, and it seems like your girlfriend wants you to do all the compromising. Don't get me wrong, fear of flying is definitely a thing. I had a severe panic attack the last time someone in my family tried to get me to fly instead of drive. But I do know there are things and methods used to help people with their fear of flying and if I was your girlfriend, I would definitely look into those methods if it was something that was very important to her.", "NTA and you need to consider if this is something you want to deal with longterm. \n\nAt the very least, she needs a license but 25 hours of driving one way  for two people would still be ridiculous. She needs help for her phobia. You love is about making concession but also wanting to be a better person for the one you love- and she should want to try to fix her condition instead of forcing you to drive 50 hours by yourself.", "Nta. She either needs to get her drivers license or get therapy for her fear of planes. Or both", "NTA.   You are allowed to be with your family and not include your girlfriend.  Also 50 hours of driving is insane.  She sounds very selfish.", "NTA\n\nI've made a 15 hour drive a couple times as a solo driver and it was brutal,  a 50 hour drive as a solo driver is a ridiculous and dangerous ask.", "I very rarely recommend people break up. But let me ask you some Qs. You can answer here or just to yourself. \n\nWhere do yoy see your relationship with Emily going?\n\nDo you love being an uber/Lyft driver?\n\nDo you like to travel? If so, would you rather travel with your life partner or always return to a temper tantrum because you went alone?\n\nWhen you GPs die (hopefully many many yrs from now), will you skip the funeral? Drive 50hrs? Or go by yourself? \n\nIf you start a fam with Emily & you have kids. You kids become adults, GO away to college, or move AWAY for work. Will you drive for visits or always expect them to come to you? Let me warn you, even if you pay for it sometimes it's impractical as them being younger, are lower on work vacation totem pole, having &/traveling with young kids is difficult, so sometimes having the older adult(s) travel (in this scenario you & Emily) is the more practical. 9\n\nDo you see where I'm going with this Qs. If you answer yes to any of the above Qs AND you want to stay with Emily, I suggest you two get couples & individual counseling .", "NTA, you driving 50 hours alone is unsafe. and you'd have to book so many hotel rooms so it probably WOULD be more expensive than the flight.\n\nunfortunate situation. does she have any past trauma with planes ? would she consider therapy ?", "NTA\n\nIf she won't work on her fear, this won't be the only time her options are limited.  Her request was not a compromise. It was a huge imposition.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou gave her many different opportunities to join you on the trip and you were given the money to pay for the ticket to bring her as well. Her fears are also valid but making you drive 50 hours just so she could join is a lot. She also has the opportunity to get her license especially if she is not getting it by choice. Maybe next time you all could plan a trip to go together and visit places on the way. She may be upset, but you did give her many many ways to join and she turned them down and basically wanted you to do all the work by driving. I'm sure if it was flipped, she would not want to drive 50 hours either.", "NTA. Even 25 hours each way would still require at least 1-2 overnight stops to properly rest.   Go and see your grandparents, and your gf needs to make realistic choices that don\u2019t fall on you to drive for the entire 50 hours round trip.", "NTA. Love means compromise, in this case hers accepting you will travel alone. BTW, my current BF doesn\u2019t come with me anywhere. It\u2019s mostly because he has limited time due to having custody of his kid. I\u2019ve traveled alone to Italy, Dc, Miami, Hawaii, and lived in Mexico and 1 month in Spain. I was fine with this because we had an annual trip to Cancun but now he doesn\u2019t want to do that either. Traveling can be a dealbreaker in relationships", "YTA, because these times don't add up whatsoever, meaning the drive would actually be much more reasonable than you're willing to admit.  \n\n\nSpeaking in one-way terms: A four hour drive plus two hour flight does not equal a 25 hour total drive. You're saying that two hours of flying equals 21 hours of driving? These number just don't add up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

In my mind, three or four days of driving to visit for one day, only to drive three or four days back just isn't feasible. This was a great opportunity for you to visit your grandparents, and I'm glad you took it.\n\nYes, relationships involve compromise, but both parties need to be part of that compromise. And the compromise needs to be reasonable. Her suggestion was not reasonable.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. I can see why she might feel upset, but that is honestly HER problem. I'm sorry you are dealing with this, but you didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA Phobias are very real and debilitating, but that doesn\u2019t mean you are required to put your life and hers at risk to accommodate her fear. And while driving 50 hours round trip may not seem like a life or death situation, that is a very exhausting thing to ask of you and honestly unsafe", "More like 4 or 5 of the 7 days.", "Definitely at least the driver's license. Because she sounds like a completely helpless person.", "Seems about right to me. A flight from Seattle to Pheonix is 2 hours, 45 minutes (about). I made this trip frequently when I was younger. To drive the same distance, it's about 22 hours.", "I could be wrong, but I think where the 12 is coming from is 4 hours there, 4 hours back, which is 8 and then 2 hour plane trip there and 2 hours back, so 4. 8+4=12.\n\nRegardless though, a road trip where you are the sole driver is difficult and exhausting. \n\nThere is potentially the cost of hotels/motels as well, which could significantly increase the cost and not make it more cost effective.", "A couple years ago,  I attended a family reunion near Houston, Texas. I live south and west Dallas/FtWorth,  about a 4 hour drive from aunt's house near Houston. \n\nOn the way out,  I dropped my brother and his wife,  as well as some cousins,  off at the airport. Brother and his wife live in Phoenix,  cousins live near San Diego. (I don't remember the exact times,  but I know they all had about thirty minutes to an hour before their flight.)\n\nI drove through a bad storm and missed my exit,  ended up adding about an hour to my drive.\n\nI was an hour away from home when my brother called to tell me they made it home safe.\n\nBy the time I got home, my cousins had landed in San Diego. \n\nIn the time it took me to drive a quarter of the way across Texas,  they had flown across 3-4 states.\n\nOPs numbers sound a bit squirrely,  but depending on locations,  not out of the realm of reality. Location,  roads (interstate vs highway vs local),  weather,  vehicle (some vehicles are simply faster and so are some drivers),  etc,  it's entirely possible it could take that long to drive,  especially since he is the only driver and will need frequent breaks.", "Without more information on his whereabouts, we have no idea if they add up or not. It depends on the road, weather and general driving conditions, plus he's the only driver, so you need to factor that in too. In some places, driving 100 miles can take half a day. The fact that the airport is 4 hours away also points towards an infrastructure that is not ideal. But even IF it's not 50 hours and \"only\" 30 to 40 (or whatever it adds up to in your mind), it's still no fun driving it all by yourself, plus he would have lost valuable time with his grandparents he hadn't seen in ages.   \nNTA", "Round trip by plane: 4 hours  by flight and 8 hours by car. \n\nRound trip by car without stopping: 50 hours.", "Yes, but that's a nearly 50% longer flight.\n\nAgain, not trying to nitpick but how long the drive is makes a big difference as to what's a reasonable accommodation for a live-in partner that has a phobia.", "Yeah... that doesn't make sense at all.\n\nIn what world does 42 hours of driving (without stopping even!) equal 4 hours of flying?\n\nUnless you're driving 20 mph or taking a fighter jet, the math isn't mathing.\n\nLike I said, I'm only bringing this up because the drive is likely much more reasonable than you're letting on, which changes the dynamics of this entire post.", "I guess we have different definitions for \"reasonable\", because I would find any drive over 10 hours completely unreasonable compared to flying for a few hours. Add to the fact that she does not have a license, so all of the driving would fall on him. Driving for long periods can be utterly exhausting, and it's not fair to expect that of someone else.", "The drive being reasonable is irrelevant since OP would be the only one driving and they don\u2019t want to do that. They\u2019re not being unreasonable for not wanting to. Even if it was say only a 7 hour drive that could be done in a day, if they don\u2019t want to, they don\u2019t want to. There are other modes of transportation and the gf needs to learn that while her phobia is real and valid, it will limit her. That\u2019s on the gf."]}
