Because she doesn\u2019t drive, she may not realize how exhausting that may be( as well as dangerous)  Sorry she felt abandoned, but there was no other way for her to reasonably attend.", "NTA. Her point about making \"concessions\" is not valid here. You haven't seen your grandparents in over 7 years and she's asking you to sacrifice over 2 out of 7 days with them to make that horrible drive. And she wouldn't even be helping with the drive at all. This is not a compromise, this is just doing things 100% her way to accommodate her needs.\n\nI agree with the other comments, she needs to get a driver's license or try to address her phobia with therapy. Even if she can't necessarily overcome her flight phobia, she's going to have to come to terms with the fact that not getting on a plane will automatically exclude her from several, if not most, trips.", "NTA. You didn't abandon her. She knew exactly where you were going and when you would be back and I assume you were reachable by phone. Her fears are just that, her's. If she is choosing to not deal with them and get help, then she needs to understand that it's going to limit her ability to do things. You had every right to say no to her road trip request. As someone who has made multiple road trips, being the only driver is exhausting. \n\nAlso her argument of \"Love is about making concessions and helping each other\", well if that's how she feels, why isn't she working on herself and trying to get her license to help lessen the load of you having to drive all the time? \n\nIf relationships are about give and take, sounds like she's taking a lot in this case and not giving it back.", "NTA. Is she seeking some sort of therapy for these phobias? Because it sounds like they're getting worse, and not better. We can all make reasonable accommodations for those we love, and we all have our issues, but asking you to drive 50 hours rather than flying, wow, just no.", "NTA-Phobias are very real and very serious but she needs to realize that some phobias mean you have to give something up if you cannot accommodate the phobia. You not being willing to drive for 50 hours as the solo driver is a great example.", "NTA. That\u2019s a huge ask, and one she shouldn\u2019t make if she\u2019s not willing to share the work. She needs to step up and get her driver\u2019s license if she\u2019s interested in road tripping.", "NTA.  She could get treatment for her phobia and get over it.  I did, and it worked.  Instead, she expects everyone else to go to great lengths to accommodate her problem, which is fixable, but she chooses not to.", "NTA - I have a fear of flying and I happen to love road trips. But 50 hours isn't just exhausting, it's like 4 days of driving. And if you're the only one driving, that just sucks. Love is about compromising, and it seems like your girlfriend wants you to do all the compromising. Don't get me wrong, fear of flying is definitely a thing. I had a severe panic attack the last time someone in my family tried to get me to fly instead of drive. But I do know there are things and methods used to help people with their fear of flying and if I was your girlfriend, I would definitely look into those methods if it was something that was very important to her.", "NTA and you need to consider if this is something you want to deal with longterm. \n\nAt the very least, she needs a license but 25 hours of driving one way  for two people would still be ridiculous. She needs help for her phobia. You love is about making concession but also wanting to be a better person for the one you love- and she should want to try to fix her condition instead of forcing you to drive 50 hours by yourself.", "Nta. She either needs to get her drivers license or get therapy for her fear of planes. Or both", "NTA.   You are allowed to be with your family and not include your girlfriend.  Also 50 hours of driving is insane.  She sounds very selfish.", "NTA\n\nI've made a 15 hour drive a couple times as a solo driver and it was brutal,  a 50 hour drive as a solo driver is a ridiculous and dangerous ask.", "I very rarely recommend people break up. But let me ask you some Qs. You can answer here or just to yourself. \n\nWhere do yoy see your relationship with Emily going?\n\nDo you love being an uber/Lyft driver?\n\nDo you like to travel? If so, would you rather travel with your life partner or always return to a temper tantrum because you went alone?\n\nWhen you GPs die (hopefully many many yrs from now), will you skip the funeral? Drive 50hrs? Or go by yourself? \n\nIf you start a fam with Emily & you have kids. You kids become adults, GO away to college, or move AWAY for work. Will you drive for visits or always expect them to come to you? Let me warn you, even if you pay for it sometimes it's impractical as them being younger, are lower on work vacation totem pole, having &/traveling with young kids is difficult, so sometimes having the older adult(s) travel (in this scenario you & Emily) is the more practical. 9\n\nDo you see where I'm going with this Qs. If you answer yes to any of the above Qs AND you want to stay with Emily, I suggest you two get couples & individual counseling .", "NTA, you driving 50 hours alone is unsafe. and you'd have to book so many hotel rooms so it probably WOULD be more expensive than the flight.\n\nunfortunate situation. does she have any past trauma with planes ? would she consider therapy ?", "NTA\n\nIf she won't work on her fear, this won't be the only time her options are limited.  Her request was not a compromise. It was a huge imposition.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou gave her many different opportunities to join you on the trip and you were given the money to pay for the ticket to bring her as well. Her fears are also valid but making you drive 50 hours just so she could join is a lot. She also has the opportunity to get her license especially if she is not getting it by choice. Maybe next time you all could plan a trip to go together and visit places on the way. She may be upset, but you did give her many many ways to join and she turned them down and basically wanted you to do all the work by driving. I'm sure if it was flipped, she would not want to drive 50 hours either.", "NTA. Even 25 hours each way would still require at least 1-2 overnight stops to properly rest.   Go and see your grandparents, and your gf needs to make realistic choices that don\u2019t fall on you to drive for the entire 50 hours round trip.", "NTA. Love means compromise, in this case hers accepting you will travel alone. BTW, my current BF doesn\u2019t come with me anywhere. It\u2019s mostly because he has limited time due to having custody of his kid. I\u2019ve traveled alone to Italy, Dc, Miami, Hawaii, and lived in Mexico and 1 month in Spain. I was fine with this because we had an annual trip to Cancun but now he doesn\u2019t want to do that either. Traveling can be a dealbreaker in relationships", "YTA, because these times don't add up whatsoever, meaning the drive would actually be much more reasonable than you're willing to admit.  \n\n\nSpeaking in one-way terms: A four hour drive plus two hour flight does not equal a 25 hour total drive. You're saying that two hours of flying equals 21 hours of driving? These number just don't add up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Because she sounds like a completely helpless person.", "Seems about right to me. A flight from Seattle to Pheonix is 2 hours, 45 minutes (about). I made this trip frequently when I was younger. To drive the same distance, it's about 22 hours.", "I could be wrong, but I think where the 12 is coming from is 4 hours there, 4 hours back, which is 8 and then 2 hour plane trip there and 2 hours back, so 4. 8+4=12.\n\nRegardless though, a road trip where you are the sole driver is difficult and exhausting. \n\nThere is potentially the cost of hotels/motels as well, which could significantly increase the cost and not make it more cost effective.", "A couple years ago,  I attended a family reunion near Houston, Texas. I live south and west Dallas/FtWorth,  about a 4 hour drive from aunt's house near Houston. \n\nOn the way out,  I dropped my brother and his wife,  as well as some cousins,  off at the airport. Brother and his wife live in Phoenix,  cousins live near San Diego.

It depends on the road, weather and general driving conditions, plus he's the only driver, so you need to factor that in too. In some places, driving 100 miles can take half a day. The fact that the airport is 4 hours away also points towards an infrastructure that is not ideal. But even IF it's not 50 hours and \"only\" 30 to 40 (or whatever it adds up to in your mind), it's still no fun driving it all by yourself, plus he would have lost valuable time with his grandparents he hadn't seen in ages.   \nNTA", "Round trip by plane: 4 hours  by flight and 8 hours by car. \n\nRound trip by car without stopping: 50 hours.", "Yes, but that's a nearly 50% longer flight.\n\nAgain, not trying to nitpick but how long the drive is makes a big difference as to what's a reasonable accommodation for a live-in partner that has a phobia.", "Yeah... that doesn't make sense at all.\n\nIn what world does 42 hours of driving (without stopping even!) equal 4 hours of flying?\n\nUnless you're driving 20 mph or taking a fighter jet, the math isn't mathing.\n\nLike I said, I'm only bringing this up because the drive is likely much more reasonable than you're letting on, which changes the dynamics of this entire post.", "I guess we have different definitions for \"reasonable\", because I would find any drive over 10 hours completely unreasonable compared to flying for a few hours. Add to the fact that she does not have a license, so all of the driving would fall on him. Driving for long periods can be utterly exhausting, and it's not fair to expect that of someone else.", "The drive being reasonable is irrelevant since OP would be the only one driving and they don\u2019t want to do that. They\u2019re not being unreasonable for not wanting to. Even if it was say only a 7 hour drive that could be done in a day, if they don\u2019t want to, they don\u2019t want to.

Or take 2 weeks off for the trip. \n\nGF is nuts. \nNTA", "I mean even if they did both drive that'd still be a miserable time. Even driving 20 hours a day it's still more than 2 days of just driving... and then they'd have to do it all again on the return. With hotel and gas fees it's probably more expensive than flying. So OP would be paying more to have significantly less time with their grandparents", "The numbers DO add up.  Example: it's about 4 hours from central Ohio to San Antonio via flight with stops then another 1 hour to where my grandparents lived.  So 10 hours round trip.  It's 19.5 hours without stops to drive the same distance.  When we went down for grandparent's funeral during the height of covid we drove.  With stops etc it took us 2 days.

Nobody 'abandoned' her, she's 20 years old, not six. Maybe she should also try researching bus and train timetables so you can travel places together without you having to get exhausted driving.\n\nAlso, if you and Emily or anyone else want to travel to Europe, Asia or elsewhere without flying (I'm guessing you're in the USA), check out 'repositioning cruise'  deals - you can get boat tickets all over the world for a fraction of the normal price.", "NTA. The two of you could absolutely, at some point in the future, have a road trip adventure and build those memories, but it was actually pretty selfish and unreasonable of her to expect you to change the plans to that degree to accommodate her for a trip to see your grandparents. While it's understandable that she might feel left out and disappointed, she was unable to join you because of her phobias and it's her responsibility to come to terms with that.

Personally I could not be with someone that doesn't drive by choice (what happens when you have kids and they need to go to appointments sports etc,? Will you have to take time off work all the time? And I get that phobias are real but they can be overcome by getting therapy. My aunt actually got help for her fear of flying just so she could come to my wedding from  Europe to the US. Life is al about choices. It seems like she's made her choices but then expects you to make all the concessions becuse of her choices. That's not how relationships work either.\nAnd if you're at all interested in travel you might as well give up on that idea because she will never let you travel alone from the sounds of if she felt abandoned by you visiting your own damn family you hadn't seen in years.

I just started ERP therapy for OCD, where the whole point is exposure therapy. I have been so so uncomfortable at times, but it\u2019s also been so helpful in helping me approach the world in a healthier way.", "I don't keep killer animals under my kids bed. Your parents must have been interesting people to do that to make being scared of monsters under the bed real. Or of course, we can all just pull ourselves up by our boot straps.", "I don\u2019t think so. I barely made it from Baltimore to Dallas in 24 hours of driving.", "Agreed with the caveat that some people don\u2019t have access to therapy. I believe the next best thing is to research how to do ERP or other exposure methods and slowly wade into the waters. \n\nBut it depends on the trigger and level of anxiety. For example\u2026 doing exposures for social anxiety may not require a therapist in the same way that advanced agoraphobia does.", "Wow you must be so scared of the killer planes under your bed", "If you can't see that being in a plane, that can crash, is more reasonable than being scared of monsters under the bed and that this obtuse attitude is only preventing you from empathizing with anyone who doesn't share your specific experience, I don't know why you ever said you wanted to understand phobias. You obviously don't.", "NTA - she isn't trying. It isn't fair to you and she is doing a disservice to herself. That disservice is not your responsibility.", "NTA, but you guys need to have a talk about this and include the helpful suggestions from other posters. Your gf needs to take her own advice about concessions. Plus, her badgering you about it for weeks turns my stomach.", "Absolutely NTA. IIve done New Hampshire to Tampa with one stop, and Tampa to Philadelphia non-stop. My choice, but with a so that doesn't drive. To have her expect you to do a trip of that magnitude as a sole driver is exceedingly selfish. That kind of road trip can take days to recover from. Op's so needs to seriously reevaluate her life choices, and her expectations of others.", "My first relationship was very controlling so I have a sort of \"test\" for lack of a better word when I start dating someone new. I am very close with my family so I like to visit them, go for holidays etc. I will plan to go visit my family alone, intentionally alone. If my current partner throws a fit, starts a guilt trip, sulks and silent treatment or anything like that, than they are too emotionally immature for me. I don't see why I shouldn't be able to see my friends or family because you can't get the days off or just don't feel like going or any of your reasons OP. Being a \"package deal\" is not literal in the sense that you must be joined at the hip or can't do things on your own. You're both young but please keep that in mind, I only wish I had understood that sooner.", "NTA, it's absurd to expect YOU to drive 50 hours so she can tag along instead of flying or even bothering to get her license so she could share the driving!\n\nSorry to say but your gf seems entitled and immature.", "NTA It seems that you are the only one expected to make concessions.  I would resent having to be the sole provider of transportation. Why hasn't she tried to get her D.L.?  Doesn't she realize that all that time driving, and stopping to rest and eat would be stealing time from your visit with your Grandparents which is your entire reason for going? What was more important spending time with your Grandparents that you haven't seen in 7 years, and who knows when you will see again, or taking a torturous car trip to appease your GF?", "NTA. Her phobia isn't your problem. I've driven back and forth from Colorado to NY 6 times because I share that phobia. I always offer to drive myself and let others fly. I waste my own time, not everyone else's", "NTA\n\nA friend and I once drove from Seattle to Milwaukie, Wisconsin, a 28 hour trip. With both of us driving, it still took two and a half days. You'd have no time there at all, if you could even manage to get there in time to visit, being the only driver. This is incredibly selfish on her part, and it's no \"adventure\" when you're doing all the heavy lifting. She needs serious therapy, and perhaps the two of you need an honest look at whether this relationship is going to work long term if she's not willing to get it.", "NTA: I'm confused by a whole lot of this content however... are you in the United States? Because I can't think of anywhere in the continental United States where anything is that far.", "NTA she needs to grow up and get her license.", "NTA\n\nShe said love is about helping each other then she needs to help you both and get a license and go to therapy. It\u2019s selfish to ask you to drive all those hours like that.", "NTA", "NTA, it\u2019s her phobia. You don\u2019t have to cater to it. She needs to look into therapy and learn to be more independent.", "NTA. She was just looking for a cross country adventure with you being the driver and bank.  Good for you that you went with your parents.", "NTA always easy for the one not driving to want to take the long journey. I have some non-drivers in my life luckily only a few of them just don\u2019t understand how tiring it is to always be the one behind the wheel. \n\n> She insisted that love is about making concessions and helping each other\n\nI\u2019d like the know what she was bringing to the table for this plan seeing as how she wasn\u2019t contributing money or driving duties. She wanted you to drive 50 hours while she never drives.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to drive 50 hours either. Not to mention the wear and tear on the vehicle and the added costs of lodging and meals.\n\nThe silent treatment is immature.\n\nContrary to what she said, she could\u2019ve taken the bus on her own. It just wasn\u2019t appealing or convenient.\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t want to miss out, she needs therapy. She can\u2019t expect that the only options are for you to coddle her or miss out so she won\u2019t feel bad. She has to change because in these larger situations she\u2019s being a burden.", "NTA phobias are real but people are responsible for their own mental health. If she refuses to get on a plane she has to learn to drive", "NTA \n\nGF is nuts! \nNo matter how hot she is, run away while you can!", "NTA, you aren't married and she's asking a lot. I think she should work with someone on overcoming her fear, but that's up to her.", "Yes. She's 20 years old. Time to learn how to drive. Options open up and she could have been on this trip as a contributing driver. That's a long haul for just 1 driver and she would know that if she ever cared to drive.", "I think it's relevant because honestly it makes the whole thing even worse. OP hasn't seen her grandparents in a really long time, and the gf's insistence on driving takes away a considerable chunk of precious time from the trip. Yeah, the situation would still be NTA even if OP had seen her grandparents more recently, but it just makes the gf's request even MORE unreasonable IMO.", "I mean, if they happen to live in a city plenty of people get around without a car just fine. But given the state of public transportation in a lot of the US, it would be very impractical.", "I live in a city, it's still a half mile walk to the grocery store, I guess you can take a buggy home lol.... Doctor's office? Nearest GP is 2 miles, which is ok I guess if you have an extra hour to kill on walking. \n\nBut where I grew up? Nearest grocery store was 15 miles. Friends houses? At least 10. Sports / after school activities? 15-20. It's not practical for most of the US to not be able to drive. \n\nAlso probably goes without saying but bike paths are a pretty new thing in my state, they exist in a few cities but not a lot. And a lot of the time your lucky to have a sidewalk, sometimes not even a shoulder to walk on.", "From LA to my city on the US east coast the flight time (going with the jet stream) is 4.5 hours and 2 of my friends made the drive without any hotel stops in around 42 hours. Besides going faster, planes have the advantage of traveling in almost a straight line to their destination.", "You do not need to drive for half a mile. That's like a 10 minute walk max.\n\nIn almost any big city its far cheaper to not own a car and uber when you need yo and then use rentals for getting out of the city.\n\nParking a car costs me $200 a month, I haven't ever taken more than $200 in a single month. That doesn't even include gas, car payments, insurance or maintenance", "Nah he's just unreasonable.", "My husband is from Maine I\u2019m from Florida. We lived in Savannah GA for 7 years. It\u2019s 24 hours, including stops, one way from where he grew up in Maine to Florida. We\u2019ve done that drive multiple times in one fell swoop without stopping. I don\u2019t recommend doing this. Breaking it up into two 12 hours days is easier to do but it\u2019s still a push. We fly now that we have kids but are hoping to plan a multi week trip to Florida to see my family(we live in Maine now) and fully plan on ensuring we\u2019ve got enough travel time and actual time in Florida. I would NEVER drive it if we only had a week total.", "I did 11.5 each way on my in a single day for a camping trip.  It was pretty hellish, even if overall it was worth it. If I do that trip again, I'm breaking it up each way.\n\nI also did semi-regular 6-7 drive with my ex to see her family.  Those were rough too, even if they were worth it.", "Excellent! I have a friend who is working through this phobia and I\u2019ll mention this too. Thank you.", "Congratulations on the start of your journey. You are brave and strong for making that step! You won\u2019t regret it.", "My husband did this once with his best friend from San Diego to North Carolina. They didn\u2019t stop except to pick up his friends new dog. It took them 43 hours of solid drive time with stops only for gas and food. My husband said both of them were too nervous to actually sleep because they felt like they needed to stay up for the other person. He said it was the stupidest thing he\u2019s ever done. Of course they made it within a mile of their barracks and my husband smashed his friend\u2019s truck into a concrete barrier at the gas station. He was so upset but I know it was from s sheer exhaustion.", "Honestly having had lay people try this with me, no. Without any kind of guidance it\u2019s dangerous and should not be encouraged. It can result in trauma.", "Thank you!! It\u2019s so hard, but I\u2019m really proud of the progress I\u2019ve made :)"]}
