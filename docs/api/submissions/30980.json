{"id": 30980, "submission_id": "17vbafn", "title": "AITA for telling my parents respect goes both ways, and denying them access to my children?", "selftext": "I (F32) have two wonderful children (M6 and F4) with my husband (M35) of eight years. It is important to note that I am white, while my husband is an immigrant to my country and was born and raised in T\u00fcrkiye.\n\nMy parents (M60 and F57) have never taken a shining to my husband, and it has been a rocky road, but everyone is civil. That being said, there was a bit of drama when naming our children as my husband and I wanted names that honoured both cultures and would be easy to pronounce for everyone in both languages. Think Omar, Nadia, Adam, etc. My parents vehemently disagreed with our choices, specifically when it came to our son's name, and they made that very clear.\n\nThis story mostly centres around my son - the child with the name they dislike the most. I recently overheard my dad talking to my son, and he used an absolutely butchered nickname which I had never heard before. My son told my dad he didn't like it, and my dad told him that he should get used to it because everyone at school will use the name.\n\nI intervened at that point and asked my dad what he thought he was doing. My dad said that since my husband and I had chosen an \"exotic name\" (his words), it was not his fault that there would be \"horrible and ridiculous nicknames\" that come out of it. I said that any name, \"exotic\" or not, could have some kind of horrible nickname come from it, and as an adult he should have stopped using the nickname when my son said that he didn't like it.\n\nMy dad's argument was that a bully at school wouldn't stop if my son said to stop, and we needed to teach my son now that by telling people to stop, it will only egg them on. He also said that he wouldn't be surprised if the teachers also started using the nickname, and that children should expect to be mocked. I asked my dad if he was comparing his behaviour to a bully, and he said no, he was teaching my son to toughen up. My dad said that it wasn't his fault we couldn't pick \"a good old English name, like Henry or Robert.\"\n\nI was so mad. I told my dad that if he expected to be respected by our family unit, we all deserved respect in return, and that mocking a child's name was beyond the pale. My mom, who had been listening to our conversation, stepped in and said that my dad wasn't mocking my son, he was giving him a taste of the future and we should be thankful to them for showing us what a bad choice we had made \"while there is still time to change it.\"\n\nI kicked both my parents out of my home, and told them that they were not welcome back until they could apologise to my son and use his real name when talking to/about him. Now my sister (F29) has been sending me messages saying that I need to be aware that they \"come from a different time\" and I shouldn't seperate children from their grandparents. She said I could have had a discussion with my dad without barring them from my home and family, and I have hurt them beyond belief just in time for Christmas we all should be together.

It is important to note that I am white, while my husband is an immigrant to my country and was born and raised in T\u00fcrkiye.  \nMy parents (M60 and F57) have never taken a shining to my husband, and it has been a rocky road, but everyone is civil. That being said, there was a bit of drama when naming our children as my husband and I wanted names that honoured both cultures and would be easy to pronounce for everyone in both languages. Think Omar, Nadia, Adam, etc. My parents vehemently disagreed with our choices, specifically when it came to our son's name, and they made that very clear.   \nThis story mostly centres around my son - the child with the name they dislike the most. I recently overheard my dad talking to my son, and he used an absolutely butchered nickname which I had never heard before. My son told my dad he didn't like it, and my dad told him that he should get used to it because everyone at school will use the name.  \nI intervened at that point and asked my dad what he thought he was doing. My dad said that since my husband and I had chosen an \"exotic name\" (his words), it was not his fault that there would be \"horrible and ridiculous nicknames\" that come out of it. I said that any name, \"exotic\" or not, could have some kind of horrible nickname come from it, and as an adult he should have stopped using the nickname when my son said that he didn't like it.  \nMy dad's argument was that a bully at school wouldn't stop if my son said to stop, and we needed to teach my son now that by telling people to stop, it will only egg them on. He also said that he wouldn't be surprised if the teachers also started using the nickname, and that children should expect to be mocked. I asked my dad if he was comparing his behaviour to a bully, and he said no, he was teaching my son to toughen up. My dad said that it wasn't his fault we couldn't pick \"a good old English name, like Henry or Robert.\"  \nI was so mad. I told my dad that if he expected to be respected by our family unit, we all deserved respect in return, and that by mocking a child's name was beyond the pale. My mom, who had been listening to our conversation, stepped in and said that my dad wasn't mocking my son, he was giving him a taste of the future and we should be thankful to them for showing us what a bad choice we had made \"while there is still time to change it.\"  \nI kicked both my parents out of my home, and told them that they were not welcome back until they could apologise to my son and use his real name when talking to/about him. Now my sister (F29) has been sending me messages saying that I need to be aware that they \"come from a different time\" and I shouldn't seperate children from their grandparents. She said I could have had a discussion with my dad without barring them from my home and family, and I have hurt them beyond belief just in time for Christmas we all should be together.

The argument that he is getting him used to the bullying by doing it at home is one I have heard before. It has no merit. Home and family should be safe from bullying.

What kind of fucked up logic is that?  I totally agree he needs to apologize to your son, you and your husband.  The apology should also include his admitting to bullying your son and why bullying is wrong BEFORE he says sorry.  Without repentance the apology is hollow and worthless.  Not to mention how he influenced and affected your child.  Now your child has had a bad experience with his g-pa he probably won\u2019t soon forget.

Your sister is probably pressuring you because your parents are making her life difficult and she's counting on you to be the reasonable party that will give in.

That is a LOT better than so many parents who choose weird spellings of \"good old English names\" to try to be unique and end up causing the kids lifelong difficulties. \n\nAnd nicknames are created from many different things and many of them don't have anything to do with a person's actual given name. Like a friend of mine whose nickname is \"Toast\" or a couple of my brother's friends were \"Opie\" and \"Big Nuts\". Nicknames are created by friends, family, bullies and sometimes shortened versions of your own names that we prefer to go by. \n\nI've often found with this particular issue, that if someone is calling you something that you don't want to be called and won't stop when asked, that calling them something they don't want to be called in return often makes them just as or more upset than you and will often get them to stop. Especially if you remain calm and like their name calling doesn't matter. It's a two fold attack of not giving them the reaction they want AND understanding that the fact that they are name calling to hurt someone means that they would be hurt by being name called. \n\nSo if my parent was a bully like your dad, I'd probably start calling him something other than Dad/Grandpa. Which could be his given name if that would piss him off, or something more colorful based on things you know he doesn't like. And if he complains about it you can tell him you're preparing your son for the bullies that might call him names.
