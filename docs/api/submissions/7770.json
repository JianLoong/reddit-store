I picked it up and apologized profusely (it was a chess set and nothing was broken or damaged) but I left in the next 5 minutes and was embarrassed my kid was causing issues in someone else\u2019s home as a welcomed guest.

Hopefully this will be the breaking point for your brother to accept responsibility for his child and get him under control. But that's not your problem to deal with honestly.\n\nSuing to replace the value of a very expensive piece is absolutely the right thing to do.

It seems kind of silly to go through a personal lawsuit when insurance will be the most likely way of getting the replacement value of the vase.  There's no point in putting himself through all the stress of that lawsuit if he just wants the money.", "INFO: Just to pull together what you've said in comments: You have insurance that would cover the cost of the vast but you won't be submitting a claim and will, instead, sue your brother for the cost of the vase plus expenses because it's quicker?", "NTA Sue him for the vase and if he drags it on, add on as many past damages as you legally can until he settles.

You went there first instead of asking brother how he planned to make you whole on this.  If he can afford it,  he really should. If he can't afford it,  then what do you hope to accomplish beyond racking up legal bills for him to have to pay on top of everything else? If he can afford it, and buys new stuff or sends the kid to camp or expensive vacation or private school instead of making good-- well,  that's when you sue.", "Y T A for suing your brother.\n\nIn essence, you are trading any future relationship with your brother and nephew for money. The vase is gone and completely irreplaceable. So why would you need money if you aren't going to replace it? Does your brother even have the means to give you 6 figures? Are you really willing to inflict that much financial harm on your brother's whole family to punish him?\n\nESH verdict because the kid purposefully broke your vase, but I don't agree that you can automatically say that it is your brother's fault.
