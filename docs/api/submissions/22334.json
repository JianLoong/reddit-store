Thinking something was wrong, I call right away and she already sounds emotional. She's explaining that she feels as though I haven't made our friendship a priority and that I barely know her kids because I've only seen them a handful of times. \nMy thought process was to give them space during the first few months of birth. They should be taking that time to bond. But during all of this, my husband and I have had some financial struggles, a death in the family and just very busy lives. This half of the year we tried to focus on all the things we wanted to do before we try for kids later this year. \nSo now she wants some space and said maybe we can talk again in the winter? Which hurts because I'll miss their first birthday. She never told me how she was feeling until now. I like to be told what I'm doing wrong so I can own up to my shit and fix it. And I get she's busy but I feel we both slacked on communication. She reaches out to our other friends, just not me. She said she doesn't know what she wants to come out of this break but I'm just supposed to wait around for her to decide if a 10+ year friendship is worth working on or officially leaving.

If she\u2019s being that icy over something so ridiculous, it\u2019s best to let her go", "NTA\n\nI would assume a new parent would want time to bond with their baby, too. (Also, I have zero interest babies/infants/toddlers and have no desire to be around them, but that's just me.)\n\nCould you have kept in touch, reaching out on socials or with the occasional call (assuming you didn't)? Probably. But that's a two-way street, and you were going through your own stuff too. For her to jump straight to \"You gave me too much space so now I need space from you, feelings-hurter!\" is asinine.", "NTA - Don\u2019t book a trip to Guilt Trip City.", "Your friend of ten years wants to go on a \u201cbreak\u201d-because you have had a *life* and you haven\u2019t fawned all over her and her babies for the last nine months. \n\nI wonder how many other people she is going to alienate before she looks around and finds she only has new mothers to talk to. And she wonders where her old friends have gone. And she is starved for sone adult conversation that doesn\u2019t revolve around sleep training and burping methods. NTA", "NTA. Friends come and go.", "NTA. She never once reached out to you to see how you\u2019re doing. You have things going on in your life too and her babies are not a priority. She sounds self absorbed. Enjoy the break from her self centered behavior and let the friendship go.", "People are weird.\n\nOP wants to spend less time with friend\n\nFriend gets mad at OP for spending less time with her, forces her to spend even less time with her\n\nOP gets mad because she wants to spend more time with her.", "No, you\u2019re not the asshole. My aunts and uncles barely met their nephews and nieces, and that\u2019s actual blood. Your friend should stop acting hysterical over trivial matters.", "NAH. You both became busy in your adult lives and it prevented you from checking in on each other and you ended up growing apart. Unfortunately that ends up happening sometimes and neither if you are the AH for it.", "NTA\n\nI've had a similar feeling as your friend as I've had a new child in my family and my friends didn't see me as much. I felt a little bitter admittedly but you know what? Everyone else has shit going on behind closed doors. That saying applies to you and your friend. You did the right thing by giving them space to bond with their kids.\n\nOne thing I would say is that there's a clear lack of communication here and you admit that, which is good but it's not far for your friend to put it all on you. It does go both ways if she's going to dish out the blame. Did she know about your personal situation? If not then possibly explain it. If she does then I think that's fairly insensitive of her.\n\nReach out to her because it's clear that this friendship means a lot to you. Explain all if you haven't already. If she doesn't reciprocate then wait it out, her hermones are probably all over the place as well as the sleep deprivation.\n\nI don't think she's the asshole either tbh. Just a shit situation for you both.", "This is why they say you find out who your friends are when you have kids\u2026 NAH. You both just need to communicate better.", "Nta you had other priorities to worry about. Her children don't revolve around you. You too were busy. As you said you saw them a few times. You both were busy.", "NAH - welcome to the normal progression of adult friendships. New children, jobs, death, hardships and other priorities will either make, break, or change the best friendships one way or another.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She didn't tell you how she was feeling at all and has blown up now \"needing a break?\" Even if you'd intentionally avoided her kids that would still be NTA, you're her friend not necessarily her kid's friend. If she wanted you to be closer she could have expressed that desire with words.", "I clearly agree! I didn't understand wanting space if all you've gotten this space. And yes, I absolutely could have reached out more. I have no issues owning up to that", "How wonderful for her. I bet, to an outsider, the conversations amongst this group of other moms are absolutely \u2026 scintillating.", "Yes! She actually joined an app to meet other moms", "The friend is an AH for the way she approached it. Instead of \u201chey, I miss hanging out with you, can we find a time to catch up\u201d she went with \u201cyou\u2019ve been a bad friend and I don\u2019t want to hear from you for six months,\u201d seemingly out of nowhere.", "Thank you! She knew about the death in the family but that's about it. I tried to explain the rest on the phone but she didn't comment on it.\nDefinitely a shit situation. I'll give her time and then fully explain my side to her when she's ready to talk to me again.", "It doesn't really sound to be about \"wanting space\". It sounds more like it's about making sure you know you're in the doghouse.\n\nIf she really just wanted space in the way she's already been getting, she could have just allowed the current low level of interaction continue as is. No special call needed.\n\nIf what she really wanted was **just** to get together more, she could have just called and said \"hey, wanna go get coffee?\"\n\nBy handling it the way she did, she was likely trying to lay a guilt trip on you. It's no longer that you're both busy, have different things going on and just don't connect very often. It's now because she's declared \"I'm not talking to you\".\n\nAfter all, you're not physically around each other regularly. The silent treatment doesn't work if you don't know you're getting it.\n\nAnother aspect of this may be an attempt to steer how you handle reconnecting. That when she decides your \"timeout\" is done, and contacts again, a hope that you'll be all apologetic and make an outsized effort to try to \"make it up\" to her (with little effort on her part).\n\nThere's even a chance that she might not actually want \"space\". That maybe what she really wants is you immediately reaching out with apologies and attempts to \"fix it\" right away. Not saying that this is your friend, but some people do play that sort of game\n\nAlso, yes, you could have reached out more, but so could she. Communication in these things should never be a one way street. Having kids shouldn't change that either.", "Or the friend could be experiencing PPD and lashing at at who she thinks is an unsupportive support network. Did OP just dump her like a hot potato after birth without letting her friend know why she was backing away? Because then ESH. But mainly OP since she did it without the lovely addition of afterbirth hormones and stress.", "I think that's the best thing to do but it is disheartening that she's not acknowledging your hardships too. Maybe it was the heat of the moment that possibly didn't help her react better.\n\nI hope it pans out for the best but only try so much since friendships do work both ways.", "Email her now. So that she can spend the time with the full information. Don't let her stew on her one sided hurt.", "Was your friend thinking you would help with babysitting? Cuz this whole you don\u2019t know my twins thing, makes me wonder if she was expecting you to watch her kids.", "This is it. She wanted to guilt trip OP.", "I met the baby's as soon as she allowed everyone to see them. Come winter I hit a strong case of seasonal depression so I wasn't seeing people nearly as much. I work from home and she lives on the other side of the city so me coming over after work, finally got her kids home from daycare and only had a couple hours with them before she puts them to bed. So I didn't like to intrude much on the weekdays. My weekdays are already busy with other things so it just got hard. Then the loss in the family and then more busy days. And when I do reach out, sometimes she doesn't respond. I tried but I also know I could've tried harder.", "Lashing out at someone who did nothing wrong makes her an asshole.", "And I do think hormones are playing a part of it", "Then NAH. It sounds like you are both struggling. Ask if she needs support if you're up to offering it. Otherwise, let it lie and see if you can bounce back when you're both in healthier headspaces.", "Other than explaining to her you had a tough year and a lot has gone on for you as well there\u2019s nothing more u can do if she doesn\u2019t accept your explanation. \n\nThe truth of the matter is motherhood is lonely especially when the children are not in school yet. She is probably feeling blue, she most likely doesn\u2019t hear or see many of her friends anymore. It\u2019s very common for friends to drift away after u have children. \n\nI\u2019m not saying she\u2019s being reasonable, quiet the opposite actually, she\u2019s probably just overwhelmed and feels sad. It doesn\u2019t sound like she made an effort either. \n\nIf she wants to end the friendship after you explained to her it wasn\u2019t intentional than there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. She has to understand that\u2019s how things go once you reach a certain stage in life.", "You say \"She reaches out to our other friends, just not me.\"\n\nWhy is that?\n\nIf she contacts you again to tell you how disappointed she is in you, say that to her. \"But you've been reaching out to all our other friends in this time, why haven't you been doing the same for me? Why are you holding me to a different standard?\"\n\nFriendships grow and fade over time, and you may need to accept that this one has run its course, at least for now. You don't need a \"friend\" who expects you to do all the giving and reaching out, but is never there for you when you're going through big things."]}
