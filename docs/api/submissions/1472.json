What they are doing is cruel to you, especially now at the anniversary of his passing. I'm so sorry for your loss and just don't talk to any of them for awhile.

I certainly cannot say I would have been as collected in my response.\n\nThat ring was your grandmother's, and she gifted it out of love for you and your fiance. That is what gives it significance. The ring simply would not hold the same meaning if handed over out of obligation (or, as I worry might be possible, stolen). To *demand* such a gift at all is ridiculous. To demand it when it already holds such great meaning and purpose for you is simply heartless. \n\nNTA. A thousand times NTA.", "NTA.  Your grandma passed it down to you. Period.

Him passing away does not mean that the ring is up for grabs.\n\nYour family is awful!!!!\n\nAs a warning- if you do ever decide you may want to not wear it, make sure you keep it hidden and locked away somewhere that no one knows about. I wouldn\u2019t put it past any of your family members to steal it and then claim \u2018it\u2019s a family heirloom and not yours\u2019.

It has so many precious memories that belong to YOU.\n\nSurely brother's fiance would feel awkward with such a ring.

Or, what if it belonged to your fiance's grandmother, would it still be okay for him to try to claim it?\n\nIt is a family heirloom that was given to you, by proxy.
