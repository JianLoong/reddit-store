I've lost parents, as well as a dad-in-law, and those were somewhere between painful and excruciating.  (I never knew my grandparents well.)

I can't wear it.  Also, the stone is a bit fragile, and it'd need a new setting because they can't resize it to fit my fat fingers.  Thanks, Auntie (though to be fair, she had no idea that Grandma had agreed to give it to me; after she learned about it, she immediately mailed to to my mom).  My aunt was a far more reasonable and supportive person, as a daughter-in-law to this grandma, than some of her sisters-in-law ever were.\n\nYour brother can go buy a modest ring (if that's all he can afford) for his beloved.  If she won't accept that, then they have waaay bigger issues to work through than the cost of an engagement ring.  My spouse of 42 years bought me a modestly-priced ruby engagement ring, because I had ethical issues with diamonds.  (I now have ethical issues with most non-lab-created precious stones, but that's a different subject.)  The ring sits in a box, because of finger size issues.

I thought once you get an engagement ring, it\u2019s yours for the rest of your life, but my fam doesn\u2019t have this tradition of passing them down (at least not yet).\n\nLike if you give it to your brother, does it then stay with him until another sibling or cousin wants to get married?

My mother has my great grandmother\u2019s ring and was going to gift it to us, but my grandmother was against it. The ring doesn\u2019t even *belong* to my grandmother but it was her mother\u2019s ring, so we respected that she, like many of us, has feelings tied to that ring and for whatever reason didn\u2019t want it used in a proposal, so we went and got a ring custom made instead.

They're not worth much but, to me, they're priceless.
