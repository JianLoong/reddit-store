But, I\u2019ve gotten mixed opinions on it and i wanna hear some unbiased reviews, you know? \n\nBasically, I\u2019ve been seeing this guy since May 2020. We aren\u2019t a couple or anything, we just happen to be attracted to each other and are finding the time to get to know each other through dates and such. He works and travels whilst I work long hours so it\u2019s hard to maintain that kind of energy through text so we update each other through random brunch dates or like last time we saw each other, we went to the movies. I really like him, we have a lot in common or at least that\u2019s what i thought. Whilst cuddling in the movie theater, I took my phone out of my pocket to text my friend back. I don\u2019t mind if he looks but he seemed very interested in our conversation. I didn\u2019t think much of it, until he asked me to hand over my phone. I honestly didn\u2019t really know what to think of it, he had never asked before and I had no idea what caused him to wanna see this time. I laughed and moved a little thinking maybe he was joking. Then he asked again, more sternly. I didn\u2019t know what to say, I just said a plain no which in hindsight i probably could\u2019ve said nicer but he caught me by surprise. He got upset and quickly started to pick his things up. Which was when I realized he genuinely wanted to see my phone and I started questioning him. His reasoning was simply \u201cI wanna see who you talk to\u201d but I don\u2019t see why he should? I don\u2019t have anything to hide but I feel like some of my conversations are very private and we honestly aren\u2019t in a position where he has the right to ask for my phone. He went quiet and left without giving me any more time to ask questions. We haven\u2019t talked since. I told my sister and she asked why i couldn\u2019t just give it to him. My friends are split and I\u2019m confused/annoyed. Like should I have simply gave him the phone? Im so confused.", "created_utc": 1669237528, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z30j97/aita_for_not_giving_my_cell_phone_to_the_guy_ive/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
