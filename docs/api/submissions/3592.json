My flatmate has her long-distance staying over for a week. Previously she and I were dating for 2 months last year but broke it off and continued to stay friends. This was a good decision imo because we didn\u2019t work out as partners but have great chemistry as friends. We moved in together 2 months ago. She is now seeing someone else (a previous ex) who lives in Ireland while we live in England. He can easily get a cheap flight back and forth so they decided to meet up and he has since stayed for 6 days now. \n\nI don\u2019t mind him staying for a couple of days but a week is a bit long, especially if this is going to be a continuos thing. I don\u2019t care that she is seeing someone again, I have no lingering feelings for her anymore. But I now don\u2019t feel welcome in my own flat. I can hear them having sex even with earplugs as our rooms are directly next to each other. They always occupy the living room and I can\u2019t work when they are in the same room. My room is too small and cold to be in the entire day.\n\nYesterday, shit hit the fan a bit. They have been using my blanket a lot and I use it to sleep as it is so cold in the flat, even with heatin, double layered clothes and blankets when sleeping. They have been taking the blanket to her room and I know they have sex on it. I asked my flatmate multiple times to clean it now and return it. She always ignored me and the last time I asked, she said she would do it \u201ctomorrow\u201d. Putting it in the laundry would take 10 seconds max\u2026 I was pissed off because she is having sex on my stuff. I don\u2019r know what when through my head and I regret dong it, but I entered her room, told her I want it back now and ripped it out of her hands. I know this was a very petty thing to do and I have send her an heartfelt apology but it still does not excuse my behaviour.\n\nI told her that she needs to accept boundaries and if she wants him over for a week, they should either get a cheap hotel or she should bisit him. She called me an asshole for even suggesting that and that my feelings are invalid and that I should just accept that he is here and treat him as a housemate instead of a bad guest. I think out frindship is irrepairbly damaged and I am planning to move out as soon as I can now. But am I the asshole in this situation for wanting to be confortable in myown house and asking her to get a hotel or visit him if she wants to be with him for over a week? I know she has a right to have him over as it\u2019s her place too and she is paying rent but it\u2019s getting unbearable now.\n\nTl;dr: Asked my flatmate to get a hotel with her long distance partner if she plans for him to stay multiple times for a week.", "created_utc": 1669814359, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z8rb5v/aita_for_asking_my_roomate_to_get_a_hotel_the/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s been a tense situation and have repeatedly asked to comply with boundaries. It\u2019s her place to and she is free to have people over but not for that long and repeatedly. I took actions in my own hands after the boundaries were crossed multiple times and have cause a massive argument to occur. I forcefully took back my possessions in her room (though I did not hurt her in any way). After this situation, I have asked for the boundaries to be respected and to make it clear that I don\u2019t want him over for so long and to just get a hotel on their own even though she  is paying for the flat.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

No one wants folk sexing on their belongs. \n\nCheck your leasing agreement regarding guests and have your landlord explain those guidelines to your housemate. \n\nFollow through with your plan to move out. You didnt ruin this friendship....she did.", "NTA.  The living room is shared space and she has to ask your permission to bring in someone and use that shared space all the time.  \n\nBedroom is her own but she is not keeping her BF in the bedroom so you have every right to tell them to get a hotel.", "NTA, and an awful situation, I'm sorry for you. If he is a \"housemate\" he needs your approval, and eventually would need to pay 1/3 of rent. But that wasn't your deal. I assume you need to live with someone to be able to afford the flat, but having to move out because of other people sucks. Maybe when he leaves you and the roomie can have a calmer talk and settle on some rules for his visits.", "NTA, Having sex on someone else's blanket (that they use every day) is pretty inconsiderate and gross.\n\nI don't think it's unreasonable to have a house rule on how long guests can stay (< 1 week) without the consent of the other roommate. It would have been nice if you'd both previously discussed it BEFORE he arrived. But you're saying it now, and she's not willing to listen. \n\nThe sex noise is annoying, but not much you can do about it, except move your bed to the other side of the room that doesn't share a wall. And try to go outside for a few hours of the day, and hope they get it out of their system then. Do you leave the apartment much?", "Assuming you are correct in that they've been using your things and having sex on them etc? No, NTA. They are ignoring your boundaries and making you uncomfortable in your own home. I know I'd be pretty offput if I could hear my guests banging in the next room- They should at least be able to compromise, not just say \"no\".   \n\n\nThat doesn't mean you should have been forceful at any point, but taking your stuff back regardless of their opinion is alright. As long as you don't get physical, if it's legitimately yours you have the right to take it back.", "NTA. Yet another terrible roomie post. You'll be a lot happier once you move out.", "NTA. \n\nNot sure how it is in England, but in the US - particularly in apartments/flats - there are often rules in the lease as to how frequently you can have guests stay the night, and it's usually no more than about 5 nights per month. I'd review your lease to see what it says. \n\nBut even if that's not in there, your roommate is being an asshole in a whole multitude of ways. She's a terrible roommate and I definitely agree with your decision to move out ASAP.", "NTA\n\n\"I dont want to hear my roommate having sex, or have her have sex on my belongings\" shouldn't be a big ask.", "NTA their using your stuff without permission and that is never OK unless that is an agreement beforehand.", "NTA. If he's a housemate, he should be paying 1/3 of rent, utilities, & groceries. But he's not. You should be comfortable in your home, & they should be considerate of your belongings & your right to the space.", "NTA! - The old saying is that guests and fish both start to stink after 3 days.  Your roomie needs to take her bunny act on the road and quit being an incosiderate AH herself.", "NTA - Your roommate is an AH. You do not need to treat her guest as a housemate, because he is not. Until he pays a third of the rent and utilities and puts his name on the lease, he is a guest. Check your lease for rules on long-term guests. Not sure how it is in England, but a lot of leases in the US have limits on overnight guests. \n\nHer behavior would still be completely inappropriate even if you two had never been in a romantic relationship.", "ESH- you were good until you lost your shit, so you suck for that.\n\nThe other bit- this is a multiple times daily on this forum and the basic AITA response is that roommates need to seek consent/agreement before having visitors stay over for long periods. Some say at all, but kind of depends on the arrangements/bathrooms and conduct of the guests/roommates.  So, bottom line- you are within your rights, according to reddit, to insist on some house rules regarding visitors. You are within your rights to not be made to feel unwelcome in your own home or that your property not be used for purposes of roommate's sex life. I recommend checking the lease to see if there are terms and conditions in regards to guests staying over- if so, this could be utilized to make the case that roommate is violating the lease and it gives you an alternative route to seek remedy. \n\nHowever, what is normally recommended is communication. In a calm moment, sit down and talk. It may be that you cannot come to an agreement which says that somebody gotta go. If you guys are going to be forced to stay together at odds with each other, again, try to come up to some short term compromise. But if roommate refuses and insists on pressing the issue, then you are going to be forced to advocate for yourself in the moment. My suggestion is to do it before you get pissed and lose your shit.  So, when bf comes to stay over your objections, I would just tell him. I need you to know that your visits are the source of major conflict between us and your conduct here has made me uncomfortable and to feel unwelcome in my own home. I'm asking you, as a hopefully decent person, not to do that to me. Please stay somewhere else. I am not going to be a doormat any longer. Who knows.. might work, might escalate.

And I mostly agree with your judgment but I also don't blame the roommate for losing their shit and forcefully taking back the blanket after the roommate had sex on it and refused to take 10 seconds to give it back to the person who owned it. I'd probably have done the same.\n\nYour solution of talking to the roommate's partner is a good one. I wish more people felt this comfortable dealing with potential confrontations; the world would be a better place with some good communication and directness.", "I see you. The thing about \"losing your shit\" is that unless it is somewhat necessary to prevent some harm from occurring- it just ends up being ammunition to undermine legitimate claims. So, while I get it, it's unhelpful strategically in the long run. Even if they had sex one more time on the blanket- it can still be washed. But now when the topic of mistreatment arises, this will be flung in OP's face."]}
