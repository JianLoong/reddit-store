Once settled for the night, the person causing the ruckus, must take said ruckus out of the sleeping area. It is not on the innocent sleeping party to move beds bc you\u2019re going to be up and down all night. \nGet your thyroid checked OP. \nCut back on stimulants. \nMelatonin. \nValerian root.\nLook up \u201csleep discipline.\u201d\nFrom Ambien to Belsomra, there is a sleep aid among the dozens available, that will work and not make you dysfunctional the next day. I had to try almost a dozen to find one that helps me sleep and doesn\u2019t make me a zombie the next day.", "Jesus even a normal sleeper would be woke up by a partner who is in and out of bed, banging pots around, probably walking about like it\u2019s a normal time of day and making no attempts to moderate their behavior.", "Choosing to cook something that even requires a pot at that time of night, given the ongoing sleep trouble context, is an AH move. Granola bars, yogurt, chips, fruit, carrot sticks, pretzels, hell even toast would be quieter than that.", ">Keeping your partner awake and causing her to lose sleep is unfair and disrespectful.\n\nSleep deprivation is also an abuse tactic. OP wants to be able to do whatever he wants whenever he wants and doesn't care about who it affects in the process, as long as he gets his way. YTA.", "exactly this! he throws that in to gain sympathy but doesn't explain anything else of their split, whether she pays for bills or their groceries or does all the housework, etc... and also, if he *agreed* to pay all the rent, why is it an excuse for him to be an asshole?", "I feel like he's characterizing her as a light sleeper to place blame on her. She's probably just a normal sleeper who is getting tortured by this dude who can't stop roaming around at night.", "Edit; you're more the AH and the only issue I take with anything she did is locking you out without communication.", "Not an accident to forget that somehow you're hungry and get up again", "She should drug herself to sleep so that he can try three different sleeping locations each night instead of two?", "Isn\u2019t OP the one who needs sleep meds? He is the one who has trouble sleeping. She sleeps fine if OP doesn\u2019t disturb her.", "Why should she take any medication for sleeping? Afterall she can sleep just fine. OP is the one to come and go and keep waking her up. Honestly I'm surprised she puts up with it at all.", "Absolutely not. He's the one with the sleeping problems, he needs to sleep in a spare room and leave his working girlfriend alone.", "Yeah, he\u2019s lucky to be YTA, he should have been the ex!", "To be fair they both seem to have sleep issues? Melatonin all round.", "The cat fundamentally rejects that it is the asshole. It has never done anything wrong in its life!", "YTA. It does when he keeps waking her up for his selfish needs.", "Pillow therapy, Lol \ud83d\ude02", "\"The pillow is just to help you sleep, hush\" lol", "Can the pillow be on fire first?", "Valerian root tea is the best. Works better than the capsules. I\u2019m an anomaly, chamomile gives me nightmares. Lemon balm tea is also very good.", "I said this on another comment, I feel like he characterized her as a light sleeper to place blame on her. Dude's in the kitchen banging pots and pans and is like \"well if she wasn't such a light sleeper\" is an insane assessment. Why can't she sleep through me rearranging the house at 3am?", "indeed, sleep-deprivation is used as a torture tactic although I don't read that into this scenario. I think OP has a chaotic ADHD that is going unmanaged.", "I am unemployed, mrs cookies makes all the money, we are still equal in the relationship. I am not shamed for my lack of income.", "It sounds like she wakes up when a pin drops. He might need them too.", "She appears to have sleeping problems, too.", "[removed]", "Melatonin doesn't work for everyone.", "[deleted]", "OP said she wakes up when he is clumsy or not light on his feet, not when a pin drops. OP needs occupational therapy to get used to using his four limbs.", "Being a light sleeper isn't a sleeping problem. The problem is that OP thinks it's okay to walk in and out of the room she's sleeping in multiple times a night, and he thinks it's okay to make noise around the house at night. If her \"sleeping problems\" can be eliminated by dumping OP, then she really has boyfriend problems.", "that doesn't mean she doesn't have any income. they very well could have a split where she pays for groceries and bills and whatnot.", "I have insomnia myself. It's selfish to get into a bed, with your partner, who you know is a light sleeper, and decide no wait I'm hungry. My insomnia is my problem to handle, I don't force my partner to deal with it. Because that would be selfish, knowing they have to go to work tomorrow, and I keep waking them up, because I can't sleep. Get it?"]}
