Maybe he could call his mom to get him a glass of water while he's at it.", "Literally, yes.", "YTA\n\nI'm a light sleeper, and I know sometimes when I'm woken up that if I'm forced to get up or woken up again shortly after I won't be able to fall back asleep.\n\nYou went to bed AFTER she was already asleep, probably woke her up without her opening her eyes. Woke her up again when 10 min later you got up... And then again when you made noise in the kitchen.\nBut you expected her to just keep trying to fall asleep while knowing you would wake her up again in 15/30 minutes.\n\nAnd then... You kept banging on the door to make sure she either didn't sleep anymore that night or at least not anymore for a few hours.\n\nMy advice? Grovel\n\nYTA YTA YTA.", "My favourite part is that it\u2019s disrespectful for her to lock the door because she should have changed rooms, but it\u2019s not disrespectful of him to go cook a whole meal *with pots and pans* in the middle of the night when she has work in the morning because he\u2019s hungry. Has this dude never heard of a sandwich? Crackers and cheese? Left overs? WTF. \n\nAnd my dude, are you telling me if she moved to the spare room she wouldn\u2019t be able to hear you banging around in the kitchen. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s not lost on me that YOU deserve respect because YOU pay the rent. That\u2019s not how partnerships work, and I\u2019d love to hear who cleans the house, buys the gifts, makes the appointments, cooks the meals, buys the groceries, etc\u2026\n\nListen, when it comes to sleep YOU are the problem. Why should she have to change beds because you can\u2019t sleep? WTF. \n\nSo far as I can tell you have 0 respect for her and expect to be catered to at all hours no matter the cost to her. And when was the last time she was allowed to just get a solid nights sleep in her own bed? \n\nYTA. And honestly, I\u2019d consider your behavior controlling and abusive (sleep deprivation is abuse and literally illegal to do to prisoners).", "'Accidently banging a cupboard door and pot'. The frick kind of midnight snack are you making? Lasagna from scratch?\n\nOP also has a second bedroom. A sane person would've gone to the second bedroom and went to sleep as quietly as possible. No, this guy decided to go the AH route to teach his GF a lesson.\n\nOP is such the TA. He can't be that oblivious.", "And also he apparently feels that him paying the entire rent entitles him to this kind of behavior. Even if she was a guest staying over, she would have every right to get angry.\n\nYTA.", "\u201cCould just as easily use a spare bedroom\u201d so could he, he knows it\u2019s that easy. it\u2019s a control thing. Not cute defs YTA", "FRT get a body pillow. Let this woman have her zzzzz's", "And eating that late right before going to sleep is not helpful to fully sleep that night without waking up again.", "Yeah, I\u2019m like him but thankfully my partner is a heavy sleeper. But if I can tell I\u2019m going to struggle with sleep or I start to toss and turn, I go to the couch and stay there because reentering will make the dogs restless and wake partner up even so. I wish we had the luxury of an extra bedroom each! He has nothing to complain about", "If I were her I would definitely sleep in one of the other bedrooms with headphones on. He can come and go out of the shared bedroom all night long if he wants, but there'd be hell to pay if he woke me up. The shared bed would still be for adult time.", "Oh but he thinks SHE is the disrespectful one! smh\n\nI am like OP. Up and down all night and I know this is my problem. I don't harass everyone else in the house just because I can't sleep and I pay rent. I get it, it sucks but OP is YTA", "If I ate and then immediately tried to sleep, I\u2019d be tossing and turning for hours.", "And the sleep deprivation is abusive too! OP needs to do some self reflection\u2026", "Oh man that sounds like a good read was that posted recently?", "Oh god, that AITA was awful.", "I feel you. In the end I bought an automatic feeder so the cats leave me sleep. 10/10 recomended!", "Also, knowingly depriving someone of sleep is an abuse tactic.", "Right? When he said problems sleeping I didn't think he meant problems he could easily manage. Like, eat a meal at a reasonable time so you're not hungry at bedtime. It's not hard to manage that one.", "My cat would write something like this: \"My human had the nerve to lock me out of OUR room after I played with my favorite toy all over the house, got the zoomies 3 times, and whined all night that she wasn't paying attention to me! So I started banging on the door until she let me in! I didn't even want in, it was just the principle of the thing.\"", "Do we have the same cat?", "Let\u2019s not get started on the whole gender thing. Not having to pay the rent is always a bargain. With that being said, I do agree with what you said about partnerships.", "Yup. I remember reading a thing a few years back that domestic abusers frequently exhaust their partner (through sleep deprivation, manual labor, or both) to make them more compliant.", "I am a terrible sleeper and I have a box of snacks for if I get hungry at night. My partner never even notices I am out of bed. I even make a cup of tea before bed and put it in a thermos just to be sure I won't bug him", "I would love one! But they won't eat kibble anymore. It's only the baby that does it (she's nearly 10 months), and she will not take no for an answer! The older ones learned pretty quickly, she just gives 0 fucks. Lol", "My cat would meow her head off", "My human had the nerve to lock me out of MY room\n\nfixed it", "She is a tabby who knows she owns me! What\u2019s your cat like?", "It seems like her only sleep issue is him....", "Doesn\u2019t work for everyone. I use to go back and forth between days and nights. I tried melatonin to see if it would help and all it did for me is make me drowsy when I woke up. Heard the same from others that have used it. It\u2019s not for everyone.", "So because she is awoken when he makes noise, gets in and out of bed, etc, and *she* has sleep issues? Yeah, no\u2026\n\nOP is TA and needs to get help for HIS sleep issues.", "I agree if I was OP I would of packed her stuff since I can't sleep. I pay all the rent and you lock me out. But OP is an AH also because if you can't sleep stay out the bedroom.", "That would hurt her hands", "Would be to time consuming if you just want to f**g sleep\u2026", "This, plus it's not like OPs gf *chose* to be a light sleeper, some people just are, just like some people are normal sleepers and some could sleep through a fucking earthquake.\n\nAlso did OP *really* need to cook at the time his Gf was sleeping? No, he could have easily grabbed a snack or made a fucking sandwich.\n\nAnd just because he pays the rent doesn't mean that he's entitled to disrupt his gf's sleep just because he can't sleep. He needs to either get medical help for his sleep issues or if he knows he can't sleep stay in a different room and read a book or watch TV or something instead of clattering around the house keeping his gf awake/waking her (and possibly his neighbours) up.", "Right. I only moved all the furniture vacuumed and then steam cleaned the carpet. She is totally over reacting. /s", "The thing is people can be abusive without knowing they are. If this is continual it is abusive even if OP doesn\u2019t mean it to be. Now that it\u2019s pointed out if they don\u2019t change they\u2019re knowingly abusive which would be worse than being just TA.", "Banging/dropping pots and pans is not equivalent to a pin drop.", "Yup. My cat has a very distinct meow, it either sounds like she's crying or chirping. When she plays it's a chirp when she wants something she isn't getting it's a cry.\n\nThey are both cute but not between the hours of 1am-5am", "Ah yes, how could I forget that all rooms are her's. \n\nBedrooms, bathrooms, pantry, I don't think the dishwasher counts as a room but it's hers.", "Yeah, I have a really bad rebound effect with melatonin. I get 4-5 hours sleep and then wake up from a deep sleep feeling like I'm going to die.", "Melatonin works for me for a single night... but if I take it more than one night in a row, I get a pounding headache that no painkiller can touch. \n\nBut I don't think being a \"light sleeper\" is a \"sleep issue.\" Most people are going to wake up if someone gets out of bed, bangs around in the kitchen, and gets back in bed, lol. \n\nAlso I'm not sure that melatonin would stop her from being woken up by noise. It doesn't for me. It helps me get sleepy and it might help me get to sleep faster if I'm woken up, but someone dropping a pot in the kitchen is going to wake me up, regardless of melatonin!", "Yeah it works for me. Not super well, but it makes me a little bit drowsy at night, which makes falling asleep slightly easier. \n\nBUT if I take it for more than one night, I get an absolutely pounding headache that painkillers don't get rid of.", "I\u2019m also not convinced that she\u2019s \u201ca light sleeper.\u201d I think it\u2019s way more likely that OP makes more noise than he knows/is willing to admit.", "Yikes. Wake up headaches sound terrible.", "Yeah they're pretty awful! Wouldn't be so bad if I could take an ibuprofen to make it go away but it doesn't help."]}
