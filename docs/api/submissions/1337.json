Otherwise, mom is wrong. \n\nAlso, high school biology is not typically an overwhelming mountain of a subject \u2014 why can\u2019t mom grab the book, get familiar with the subject, and help her daughter? Or else find a tutor for her? Or talk with a teacher about a study partner maybe?\n\nMom is the one primarily responsible here.", "It's the same advice they give you on an airplane. Always put your oxygen mask on first so you can help more people. NTA", "NTA you said you would help your sister but that you needed time to\n1) Prepare by reading what you are going to tutor her in\n2) finish a huge project that I'm assuming is going to cost a big portion of your grade \n\nYou aren't selfish for putting your work first especially since you don't know how long it will take your sister to understand the subject.", "NTA", "Just make sure to ask her when your sister needs help. If she has a test on Friday for example, then you know a deadline to stop your work in order to assist your sister. I think your mom expected you to drop everything to help your sister but just let her know that isn't reasonable and that you need an actual time that she needs the help for."]}
