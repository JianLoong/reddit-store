{"id": 19133, "submission_id": "142ly6s", "title": "AITA for not letting my DIL come to my house after how she treated my grandson at Christmas?", "selftext": "My son, Daniel (28), has been married to Cathy (28) for 4 years now and they have 2 children. I have a younger daughter, Leah (25) who is a single mom to Travis (7). Travis is autistic and has a lot of sensory issues. He receives therapies but it\u2019s still a struggle. Everyone knows about his triggers and what we do to avoid them.\n\nWhile I have tried to be welcoming of Cathy, she\u2019s always been a little cold. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt as we are a very loud, extroverted family and she\u2019s introverted. She never really made an effort to get to know us, despite our numerous attempts. Daniel has told us that her family is a lot different and isn\u2019t as warm. So, we accept her personality.\n\nThe only issue is, she is very cold to Travis. We\u2019re all firm with him and have boundaries, but Cathy finds his triggers \u201cridiculous\u201d. \n\nImportant info, Leah and Travis live with my husband and myself.\n\nEvery year at Christmas, we have a few close relatives over and host a yankee swap with gag gifts. Last year, my SIL was showing me her contribution. It was one of those singing Santas. Travis had seen this very one at the drug store and had a meltdown over it. I said it would be okay, I\u2019d just make sure Travis didn\u2019t pick that gift and we\u2019d tell whoever did pick it, to please not press play. \n\nOne person opened it. Travis saw it and instantly got on edge but the person promised they wouldn\u2019t play it and he calmed down. When it was Cathy\u2019s turn, she \u201cstole it\u201d (if you\u2019ve never done a swap before, the point of the game is you can either pick a new gift or steal someone else\u2019s if you like it better). She was sitting next to Travis at the time and pressed play. He had a meltdown and had to be brought out of the room. Cathy was laughing. I took her out of the room and asked why the hell she\u2019d do that. She said it was just a joke and she thought we were exaggerating. She then accused us of purposefully making Travis scared of things. We have no reason for doing this. Trust me, for his mental health, we wish these things didn\u2019t trigger him. But they do. \n\nI asked why the hell it was so hard for her to just accommodate her nephew. That\u2019s when she said that Travis soaks up all the attention and it\u2019s not fair that Leah had a kid before them. She and Daniel then promptly left.\n\nWhile Daniel has apologized on the behalf of Cathy, she has refused to do so. We\u2019ve tried to hold family meetings but she won\u2019t show up. Leah has seen Daniel and his kids since, but won\u2019t see Cathy. After a few months of back and forth with Cathy making it clear she wouldn\u2019t apologize , my husband and I decided Cathy is not welcome in our home until she does and is ready to treat Travis right. We\u2019ll still see them but not in our home.\n\nCathy and Daniel have found this unfair. They refused to meet up for Mother\u2019s Day and now won\u2019t come to Father\u2019s Day brunch. Which is their choice but they have made it clear they only made it because we have excluded Cathy from events in our home. \n\nAITA?\n\n\nEDIT: I should\u2019ve seen it coming that people would cry \u201cMaybe you\u2019re favoring Travis and Cathy is resentful and is right to torment a 7 year old as a result\u201d. So, I\u2019ll copy and paste a reply I made to one of these people.\n\nMy younger grandkids get time with us without Travis. We do plenty of things that Travis wouldn\u2019t want to do. They\u2019ve even slept over plenty of times when Leah takes Travis to visit her late husband\u2019s family.\n\nNot everything revolves around Travis. However, yes, we do have to make accommodations for him. It\u2019s just a fact that he can\u2019t be around too much stimulation. But Leah has never insisted anyone else change their lifestyle or plans for him. Sometimes it just means that she and Travis won\u2019t go. \n\nWe have been aware since the diagnosis that it is a rough line to walk and we have done what we can to make sure no one is left out. There are times Travis comes first, for example, in his own home. But there are just as many times that his cousins come first. Such as in their own home and at other events.\n\nBut just as it wouldn\u2019t be fair to make everything about Travis, not everything can be about his cousins either. As a whole family, there are things we cannot do. Doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t get to do them separately. But we can\u2019t leave Travis out all the time.\n\nCathy was cold like this long before Travis was born and leading up to his diagnosis. Again, in this time we were doing all we can to include her. I invited her to lunches just us or us and my son. \n\nShe is just not a big extended family person which is fine. But she can\u2019t bully her nephew.", "created_utc": 1686069855, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/142ly6s/aita_for_not_letting_my_dil_come_to_my_house/", "score": 1908, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And to be jealous of a child shows her character. You are doing exactly what needs to be done- protecting your grandson and family. The fact that she is still not ashamed of her behavior shows she will have no issue with torturing your grandson again (yes- setting him off and laughing about it was torture for him.) A grown adult bullying an autistic child? Good riddance to her", "You are most definitely NOT the asshole!", "NTA but be careful, they have 2 kids that they can cut you off from if they get offended that she\u2019s not welcome in your home\u2026 it\u2019s a really sad situation\u2026", "NTA.

NTA", "NTA.  Why a grown woman would deliberately aggravate an autistic child after she'd specifically been asked to be considerate of him is unacceptable.  It is a shame that her behavior is fracturing your family.  That said, it would seem to me that banning her from your home because of her refusal to apologize as she should is hurting most of the rest of you (since I think that means they are no longer attending any family functions) and so not a good solution.  \n\nI do get that special needs children do sometimes get more attention than other children.  Sorry she feels this takes away from her children or in some way dominates all your gatherings, which is what I am sensing and a resentment has built up (rightly or wrongly) on her part.  Maybe trying to have some time with just her children would help.  \n\nOverall, your DIL sounds difficult and you do have a situation that requires working out what is best for all the grandchildren and your family in general. Your DIL does owe an apology, but I'm thinking that won't be forthcoming so maybe if she can at least acknowledge that she has seen firsthand now why your sometimes request a certain environment for your autistic grandson and maybe you can begin to gather anew and give it another try.  We all have difficult people somewhere in our families and it requires us to figure a way around them if we can.  I know if I banned one of my children's spouses that would in essence make me lose that entire part of the family and I can see you don't want that as you obviously love ALL your family and having them together on occasion.", "Nta Cathy needs empathy and probably therapy, she's jealous of the care and compassion you're giving a disabled child.", "Nta and shame on Daniel for letting his wife's insecurities get in the way of family, she needs therapy and to learn empathy.

Honestly, I don't know if I've ever seen anyone handle a situation like this better.  I'm particularly impressed that you had the presence of mind to take Cathy out of the room so that you weren't criticizing her in front of everyone.  I've been in a situation very similar to this more than once.  I don't think I was ever able to control myself enough to not embarrass the adult for their rude behavior.  Cathy should be mortified by her own behavior and grateful that you handled it gracefully.    \n\n\nI would guess that Cathy is getting exactly what she wants--she's isolating her husband from his family.  Stick firm to those boundaries.  She shouldn't be allowed in Travis' home, his safe space, until she apologizes TO HIM and promises to do better.  But make sure you keep reaching out to your son.  There's a red flag parade here.  If she dismisses the feelings of a seven-year-old, then she certainly does the same for her husband.

A generic, blanket \"it's not fair to have to cater to Travis' needs even in his own home\" is not an excuse to be cruel to him.", "NTA. This would be bullying without the sensory issues. With them, it's torture. As an autistic adult, thank you for protecting your grandkid from the kind of person that thinks sensory issues can be forced away if only people would stop 'pandering' to us.\n\nMy take on this is that there are some things Cathy sees in Travis that were not allowed in her. As a child, she was probably punished anytime she showed she was different or 'needy'. It's pretty common with adults that bully children this way, they literally feel pain and rage at certain things children do. Furthermore, since she doesn't believe he needs the attention, she tries to prove he's a fake, and assigns blame for the attention he receives to unrelated things (like being born first). If allowed to continue having contact with him, she'd probably try to beat the 'weirdness' out of him. \n\nYou can't do anything about her. An adult has to want to seek help and change, and you can't force them into it. So what you're doing is for the best, considering this no-win situation she created.\n\nAlso, your son is a problem. Cathy very evidently has issues she can't get over, what's his excuse considering that he seems more balanced?", "NTA, what is Cathy\u2019s problem and why does she feel it\u2019s okay and acceptable to bully and traumatize a seven year old on the spectrum?\n\nShe\u2019s the asshole, and your son is the asshole for not standing up for his nephew and his family. \n\nThis chick has serious problems if she thinks messing with a kid is fun and \u201ca joke\u201d. She did it intentionally to cause him harm because she\u2019s an awful person. \n\nOnly an awful person would do that to a kid. \n\nGood on you and your husband for sticking to the \u201cno Cathy and her bs, child abusive ways in our house\u201d.\n\nIf this is a hill your son is willing to die on, that sucks and I\u2019m sorry he\u2019s okay with tormenting children. They should be ashamed of themselves.", "NTA\n\nHeaven help her kids if either of them end up being autistic.", "NTA. Cathy is mean and disrespectful not just to Travis but to you and your husband specially. Too bad for your son and their children. Consider to Limit your interaction with them for you peace.", "NTA\n\nI disagree with your goal and your strategy, but I don't think you're an AH. Not at all.  \n\nI think your goal is to punish Cathy; I think your goal ought to be protecting Travis. There's a slight difference between the two. While your strategy (i.e., excluding Cathy from major family events) will achieve both goals; my concern is that there might be an increased risk of being estranged from your other grandchildren. \n\nHowever, I applaud you for being firmly on Travis' side.  As a parent of a kid with autism, I know very well that not all grandparents \"get it\" and I am so glad that you do.", "NTA- One Cathy is bully and two she is definitely jealous she was not the first one to make you a grandmother. That Cathy laughed over Travis' meltdown and refuses to apologize shows you exactly who she is, please believe her.", "Woah, I am so sorry this is happening to you! No, your nta.", "NTA. Your DiL sounds spoiled and unhinged.", "Definitely NTA, why in the hell would a grown adult think that it is completely okay to torture an autistic 7 year old? wether or not she actually resents the child, it is very, very immature of Cathy.", "NTA.  I bet Cathy complains that Leah and Travis get to live with their grandparents just because his Dad died.  Preferential treatment!", "NTA \n\nShe is too proud to apologize", "YTA\n\nYou guys shouldn\u2019t walk on egg shells for him. You\u2019re not doing him any favors by not having him work through some of his difficulties.", "NTA but as the mom of a child who has autism I hope your daughter has been able to get Travis the support and therapy he needs.", "NTH There are people who obviously do not understand autism. When an adult asks another adult to not do something you\u2019d think they be an adult and not friggin do it. Cathy set her plan into motion the moment MIL asked everyone not to push the button on the Santa. It was a bully move and uncalled for.", "Definitely NTA . God help any kids DIL has that don't meet her expectations.", "Nta (barely) but you are making mountains out of learning opportunities have some compassion for somebody learning your realities neurodivergence takes time to use to.If you keep this stance your family gets smaller and I think you failed as a parent. Because trying to find common ground is it. Excluding for pride makes you something that I would not respect to be honest. It\u2019s ok you can, but you lose family and that to me make you sick for not trying harder. If this was your kid and not your in law you would not act like this.I don\u2019t want to judge. But enjoy your smaller family, it doesn\u2019t come back from this.", "YTA. She pressed okay on purpose, laughed, left and has not apologized.", "NTA\n\n>That\u2019s when she said that Travis soaks up all the attention and it\u2019s not fair that Leah had a kid before them. She and Daniel then promptly left.\n\nYeah this will go on for a lifetime and they'll start pitting their kid against others and further fcuk up the child's life too. And Daniel will be a mute spectator until divorce or end up resenting himself in death bed.\n\nI thought this was unique to Indian soap operas but as evident from this, people crave hierarchies and prefer to cling on to such burdensome emotions.", "NTA. Cathy is sadistic for purposely triggering a child like that. Literally wtf is her problem?", "What ADULT, in their right mind, tortures a 7 year old CHILD?!  NTA!", "NTA!!!! She INTENTIONALLY triggered your FATHERLESS autistic grandson at CHRISTMAS, that\u2019s just pure evil. You simply requiring an apology for Travis is a extremely easy request.", "NTA\n\nWhat the heck is wrong with your DIL bullying a neurodivergent kid who\u2019s less than half her age? Seems like she has some growing up to do.", "And the fact that op\u2019s son doesn\u2019t seem the problem with this. Like who tf would do this, TO A CHILD?!", "She purposely triggered a child, knowing it would upset him and thinks that is ok. I hope her kids are all perfect with no disabilities.", "Exactly! It\u2019s a very one way street in the group now unfortunately \ud83d\ude22", "Can\u2019t believe you got so many downvotes. People don\u2019t like to hear different perspectives anymore I guess. I\u2019m not ok with OP or the DIL in this situation. DIL needs to grow up a bit and OP needs to learn you can\u2019t control everyone all the time. Forgive for yourself but don\u2019t ever forget. Hopefully, y\u2019all can do some family counseling together. I hope Travis is ok and also gets the assistance he deserves, outside the family unit. \u2764\ufe0f", "This absolute horseshit of forgiving someone to make yourself better is dumb. Certain boundaries are crossed that don't deserve forgiveness. Not saying that this is strictly one of them, but I wouldn't place this Cathy's behaviour as something that needs to be addressed or tolerated outside of them not being welcome. Some people deserve forgiveness. Deliberately awful people do not.", "Thank you for posting your perspective. I may not agree 100% but you do have some valid points. I\u2019m glad you and your brother are doing well \ud83e\udd17", "It\u2019s a lack of empathy: probably narcissistic, maybe sociopathic. Her mother in laws description of her as \u201ccold\u201d is telling. She doesn\u2019t get human feelings and sees family time as competition for attention and resources. She\u2019s competing with a disabled 7 year old. That\u2019s messed up. Poor Daniel. Not going to end well.", "Right?!", "This is a bot.", "Ding ding ding \ud83d\udece\ufe0f", "Right? There is no reasoning with a person who would think that way and deliberately hurt a struggling child", "Reminds me that I used to do this when my little brother was born. There's barely over two years between us so I was a literal toddler poking him when he was asleep because I was jealous he took all mum's attention, which woke him up and guaranteed he got mum's attention. /facepalm", "Coming in as an oldest sibling it\u2019s a hard pill to swallow (not giving your parents the first grandkiddos). Idk you feel like you disappointed them or did something wrong in your life. I have my fianc\u00e9s nephew and niece. I expressed those feelings to him but would NEVER express/take it out on anyone. It\u2019s a \u201cCathy\u201d problem. She should never take it out on anyone else. \n\nAfter airing my feelings out with my fianc\u00e9, I did feel less alone. But first child syndrome is real ( and one of the many times I have noticed it)", "Could be nothing more than lip service on Daniel\u2019s part. He believes his wife is right as he\u2019s already shown, but he\u2019s willing to saying anything to his parents to keep on their good side.", "She's a grown ass woman bullying an autistic child. What part of that isn't a serious issue?", "As someone who is also autistic I really dislike that anytime negative behaviours come up (cold, mean) that people immediately jump to diagnosing them on the spectrum. I don\u2019t know any autistic people who take pleasure in watching, let alone causing, other people on the spectrum have a meltdown. Even if she is on the spectrum, it\u2019s no excuse to bully and laugh at the suffering of a child. We are capable of apologies", "Good rule.", "not exactly. your DIL was absolutely the AH. but clearly she feels her children are getting the short end of the stick. that definitely played a role in her outburst. \n\nit\u2019s not uncommon for autistic children to dominate family events. it\u2019s not their fault. it\u2019s just how it is.", "Why don't you?", "Or a paintball gun. It depends on what the kid is comfortable with", "We always say we won\u2019t include her or speak to her again but then when we have some sort of get together my MIL always invites her or she will randomly call my husband crying and in some sort of crises then he feels bad.", "and his training, obvs", "Sounds like you need to put your foot down with MIL, and invite her if she does anything like this again to disrespect your boundaries", "I'd change it to why it's okay for his wife to abuse a child.", "Of course! Lol", "Or with the husband! Why is he letting an adult bully his child!", "Let\u2019s just hope Cathy doesn\u2019t have a child who\u2019s on the spectrum. Because she just doesn\u2019t get it. NTA.", "I\u2019m sorry, but wtf is wrong with your son? What Cathy did to Travis is unforgivable and she shouldn\u2019t be welcome until Cathy recognizes how horrible her actions were and tries to make amends. But your son chose to support her?\n\nI feel this would be equivalent to finding out my partner was a racist Q-Anon follower who mocks my minority relatives. I wouldn\u2019t want anything to do with my partner unless we had (at least) and looong, hard talk.\n\nCathy needs counseling. And your son likely needs it too so he can understand why he\u2019d defend Cathy.", "Hon, ignore me if you want but your son is probably going to be more and more miserable in life. It\u2019s sad because she probably chose him because he\u2019s kind and empathetic. But, her behavior is unbalanced and unlikely to change.  He will never be happy and your grandson should very much not have to deal with this crazy woman. His uncle should see that. I\u2019m sorry."]}
