{"id": 19133, "submission_id": "142ly6s", "title": "AITA for not letting my DIL come to my house after how she treated my grandson at Christmas?", "selftext": "My son, Daniel (28), has been married to Cathy (28) for 4 years now and they have 2 children. I have a younger daughter, Leah (25) who is a single mom to Travis (7). Travis is autistic and has a lot of sensory issues. He receives therapies but it\u2019s still a struggle. Everyone knows about his triggers and what we do to avoid them.\n\nWhile I have tried to be welcoming of Cathy, she\u2019s always been a little cold. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt as we are a very loud, extroverted family and she\u2019s introverted. She never really made an effort to get to know us, despite our numerous attempts. Daniel has told us that her family is a lot different and isn\u2019t as warm. So, we accept her personality.\n\nThe only issue is, she is very cold to Travis. We\u2019re all firm with him and have boundaries, but Cathy finds his triggers \u201cridiculous\u201d. \n\nImportant info, Leah and Travis live with my husband and myself.\n\nEvery year at Christmas, we have a few close relatives over and host a yankee swap with gag gifts. Last year, my SIL was showing me her contribution. It was one of those singing Santas. Travis had seen this very one at the drug store and had a meltdown over it. I said it would be okay, I\u2019d just make sure Travis didn\u2019t pick that gift and we\u2019d tell whoever did pick it, to please not press play. \n\nOne person opened it. Travis saw it and instantly got on edge but the person promised they wouldn\u2019t play it and he calmed down. When it was Cathy\u2019s turn, she \u201cstole it\u201d (if you\u2019ve never done a swap before, the point of the game is you can either pick a new gift or steal someone else\u2019s if you like it better). She was sitting next to Travis at the time and pressed play. He had a meltdown and had to be brought out of the room. Cathy was laughing. I took her out of the room and asked why the hell she\u2019d do that. She said it was just a joke and she thought we were exaggerating. She then accused us of purposefully making Travis scared of things. We have no reason for doing this. Trust me, for his mental health, we wish these things didn\u2019t trigger him. But they do. \n\nI asked why the hell it was so hard for her to just accommodate her nephew. That\u2019s when she said that Travis soaks up all the attention and it\u2019s not fair that Leah had a kid before them. She and Daniel then promptly left.\n\nWhile Daniel has apologized on the behalf of Cathy, she has refused to do so. We\u2019ve tried to hold family meetings but she won\u2019t show up. Leah has seen Daniel and his kids since, but won\u2019t see Cathy. After a few months of back and forth with Cathy making it clear she wouldn\u2019t apologize , my husband and I decided Cathy is not welcome in our home until she does and is ready to treat Travis right. We\u2019ll still see them but not in our home.\n\nCathy and Daniel have found this unfair. They refused to meet up for Mother\u2019s Day and now won\u2019t come to Father\u2019s Day brunch. Which is their choice but they have made it clear they only made it because we have excluded Cathy from events in our home. \n\nAITA?\n\n\nEDIT: I should\u2019ve seen it coming that people would cry \u201cMaybe you\u2019re favoring Travis and Cathy is resentful and is right to torment a 7 year old as a result\u201d. So, I\u2019ll copy and paste a reply I made to one of these people.\n\nMy younger grandkids get time with us without Travis. We do plenty of things that Travis wouldn\u2019t want to do. They\u2019ve even slept over plenty of times when Leah takes Travis to visit her late husband\u2019s family.\n\nNot everything revolves around Travis. However, yes, we do have to make accommodations for him. It\u2019s just a fact that he can\u2019t be around too much stimulation. But Leah has never insisted anyone else change their lifestyle or plans for him. Sometimes it just means that she and Travis won\u2019t go. \n\nWe have been aware since the diagnosis that it is a rough line to walk and we have done what we can to make sure no one is left out. There are times Travis comes first, for example, in his own home. But there are just as many times that his cousins come first. Such as in their own home and at other events.\n\nBut just as it wouldn\u2019t be fair to make everything about Travis, not everything can be about his cousins either. As a whole family, there are things we cannot do. Doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t get to do them separately. But we can\u2019t leave Travis out all the time.\n\nCathy was cold like this long before Travis was born and leading up to his diagnosis. Again, in this time we were doing all we can to include her. I invited her to lunches just us or us and my son. \n\nShe is just not a big extended family person which is fine. But she can\u2019t bully her nephew.", "created_utc": 1686069855, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/142ly6s/aita_for_not_letting_my_dil_come_to_my_house/", "score": 722, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And to be jealous of a child shows her character. You are doing exactly what needs to be done- protecting your grandson and family. The fact that she is still not ashamed of her behavior shows she will have no issue with torturing your grandson again (yes- setting him off and laughing about it was torture for him.)

Good riddance to her", "You are most definitely NOT the asshole!", "NTA but be careful, they have 2 kids that they can cut you off from if they get offended that she\u2019s not welcome in your home\u2026 it\u2019s a really sad situation\u2026", "NTA.

NTA", "NTA.  Why a grown woman would deliberately aggravate an autistic child after she'd specifically been asked to be considerate of him is unacceptable.  It is a shame that her behavior is fracturing your family.  That said, it would seem to me that banning her from your home because of her refusal to apologize as she should is hurting most of the rest of you (since I think that means they are no longer attending any family functions) and so not a good solution.  \n\nI do get that special needs children do sometimes get more attention than other children.  Sorry she feels this takes away from her children or in some way dominates all your gatherings, which is what I am sensing and a resentment has built up (rightly or wrongly) on her part.  Maybe trying to have some time with just her children would help.  \n\nOverall, your DIL sounds difficult and you do have a situation that requires working out what is best for all the grandchildren and your family in general. Your DIL does owe an apology, but I'm thinking that won't be forthcoming so maybe if she can at least acknowledge that she has seen firsthand now why your sometimes request a certain environment for your autistic grandson and maybe you can begin to gather anew and give it another try.  We all have difficult people somewhere in our families and it requires us to figure a way around them if we can.  I know if I banned one of my children's spouses that would in essence make me lose that entire part of the family and I can see you don't want that as you obviously love ALL your family and having them together on occasion.", "Nta Cathy needs empathy and probably therapy, she's jealous of the care and compassion you're giving a disabled child.", "Nta and shame on Daniel for letting his wife's insecurities get in the way of family, she needs therapy and to learn empathy.

Honestly, I don't know if I've ever seen anyone handle a situation like this better.  I'm particularly impressed that you had the presence of mind to take Cathy out of the room so that you weren't criticizing her in front of everyone.  I've been in a situation very similar to this more than once.  I don't think I was ever able to control myself enough to not embarrass the adult for their rude behavior.  Cathy should be mortified by her own behavior and grateful that you handled it gracefully.    \n\n\nI would guess that Cathy is getting exactly what she wants--she's isolating her husband from his family.  Stick firm to those boundaries.  She shouldn't be allowed in Travis' home, his safe space, until she apologizes TO HIM and promises to do better.  But make sure you keep reaching out to your son.  There's a red flag parade here.  If she dismisses the feelings of a seven-year-old, then she certainly does the same for her husband.

She\u2019s jealous of a 7 year old.", "I was going to say YTA until I got to the part where you said she thinks his triggers are ridiculous. I get that she may be put off by your family's loud nature, especially because I'm the same way but you've been welcoming to her. I personally find loud people overwhelming and even abrasive but you don't come into someone else's home and be rude. To be honest, I can't understand why your son is still married to her. Most people wouldn't tolerate a partner being rude to their family members without a good reason. She's TA for sure.\n\nEdit: Just for the bot, I'm voting NTA.", "NTA.

It is a difficult balance.", "NTA.\nCathy literally went out of her way to trigger Travis. She thought y'all were exaggerating and made him overly scared? She sounds remorseless and even more so refusing to apologize or even talk this out. The comment about her saying it's \"\"unfair\"\" Leah had Travis before Cathy and Daniel had a child is....... Weird. Why is it unfair a child was born before another? \n\nI can't imagine feeling good about trying to upset or trigger a child... NTA again, Cathy definitely is tho", "NTA and not to stereotype but as a \"loud extroverted\" neurodivergent this sort of stuff is why I am often cautious around introverts.", "I\u2019m kind of dubious that was actually said. Don\u2019t forget all these things are just one side of the story. If it sounds like something somebody wouldn\u2019t actually say in real life, maybe you shouldn\u2019t just take it at face value.", "Saying \"just a joke\" is the ultimate bully's defence.

If it was unintended, like she pushed the button either accidentally or pushed it without knowing about his trigger, that would be different. But not only did she deliberately push the button, knowing full well about his triggers, he then melted down and she laughed at him. She actually took pleasure in his pain and distress. That is sick and sadistic. The when confronted with her sh**ty behavior, she whined like a child that it wasn't fair that he got all the attention.

I can't help but let my mind wander down a path of pondering what Cathy thinks she might get out of Travis melting down. Preferential treatment for her own kids, maybe?

It was pretty awful.\n\n\n\nThen, after dementia set in and she started thinking she was a young girl, she lit up every time she saw my son.

Always willing to accommodate my daughter and have allergy friendly food for her.
