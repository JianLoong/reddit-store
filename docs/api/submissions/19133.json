I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt as we are a very loud, extroverted family and she\u2019s introverted. She never really made an effort to get to know us, despite our numerous attempts. Daniel has told us that her family is a lot different and isn\u2019t as warm. So, we accept her personality.\n\nThe only issue is, she is very cold to Travis.

Last year, my SIL was showing me her contribution. It was one of those singing Santas. Travis had seen this very one at the drug store and had a meltdown over it.

She was sitting next to Travis at the time and pressed play. He had a meltdown and had to be brought out of the room. Cathy was laughing. I took her out of the room and asked why the hell she\u2019d do that. She said it was just a joke and she thought we were exaggerating.

She and Daniel then promptly left.\n\nWhile Daniel has apologized on the behalf of Cathy, she has refused to do so. We\u2019ve tried to hold family meetings but she won\u2019t show up. Leah has seen Daniel and his kids since, but won\u2019t see Cathy. After a few months of back and forth with Cathy making it clear she wouldn\u2019t apologize , my husband and I decided Cathy is not welcome in our home until she does and is ready to treat Travis right.

She's lucky you're willing to see her at all. It's not even the act itself (which is still awful) but then to laugh, and just completely *refuse* to apologize.  Gross. Again, NTA.", "NTA - not only was Cathy willfully cruel to Travis she refuses to even acknowledge it. Youve made attempts to address this with her and she wont even meet with you. \n\nAlso, her having animosity towards Leah for having a kid first really just cements the crazy of Cathy.", "There has got to be better way to handle this other than demanding an insincere apology. Breaking up the family under the guise of protecting one from the other is not a good strategy. \n\nIt sounds like you want your family together. Forgive her, not for her, but for yourself and your son and your entire family.   \n\n\nTalk to your grandson\u2019s therapist about how to handle your daughter in law. This situation must happen to others. There must be coping skills for family to use to facilitate ignorant family members and their churlish behavior.", "NTA. Autism aside, which is a very significant factor obviously, a grown ass women is antagonizing a 7 year old", "NTA \n\nCathy is intentionally cruel to a seven year old, hopefully Daniel wakes up and leaves", "NTA Cathy is. \n\nKnowing how dismissive she is over Travis's needs, and that she will not own her behavior, she is simply not a good person to have around him.", "NTA she clearly has issues. And to be jealous of a child shows her character. You are doing exactly what needs to be done- protecting your grandson and family. The fact that she is still not ashamed of her behavior shows she will have no issue with torturing your grandson again (yes- setting him off and laughing about it was torture for him.) A grown adult bullying an autistic child? Good riddance to her", "You are most definitely NOT the asshole!", "NTA but be careful, they have 2 kids that they can cut you off from if they get offended that she\u2019s not welcome in your home\u2026 it\u2019s a really sad situation\u2026", "NTA. Cathy is horrible. She's actually jealous of a kid? And your son is an AH to defend his wife in this situation.", "NTA\n\nShe was bullying a child (bad enough), with special needs(insane)", "NTA but be careful, they have 2 kids that they can cut you off from if they get offended that she\u2019s not welcome in your home\u2026 it\u2019s a really sad situation\u2026", "Cathy is a very cruel person! NTA", "NTA.  Why a grown woman would deliberately aggravate an autistic child after she'd specifically been asked to be considerate of him is unacceptable.  It is a shame that her behavior is fracturing your family.  That said, it would seem to me that banning her from your home because of her refusal to apologize as she should is hurting most of the rest of you (since I think that means they are no longer attending any family functions) and so not a good solution.  \n\nI do get that special needs children do sometimes get more attention than other children.  Sorry she feels this takes away from her children or in some way dominates all your gatherings, which is what I am sensing and a resentment has built up (rightly or wrongly) on her part.  Maybe trying to have some time with just her children would help.  \n\nOverall, your DIL sounds difficult and you do have a situation that requires working out what is best for all the grandchildren and your family in general. Your DIL does owe an apology, but I'm thinking that won't be forthcoming so maybe if she can at least acknowledge that she has seen firsthand now why your sometimes request a certain environment for your autistic grandson and maybe you can begin to gather anew and give it another try.  We all have difficult people somewhere in our families and it requires us to figure a way around them if we can.  I know if I banned one of my children's spouses that would in essence make me lose that entire part of the family and I can see you don't want that as you obviously love ALL your family and having them together on occasion.", "Nta Cathy needs empathy and probably therapy, she's jealous of the care and compassion you're giving a disabled child.", "Nta and shame on Daniel for letting his wife's insecurities get in the way of family, she needs therapy and to learn empathy. I can't imagine deciding to be jealous of a kid with a disability.", "NTA She sounds like a child \"it's not fair Leah had a kid first\" what in the actual fuck.", "NTA, she is sadistic.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Travis is fortunate to have a family who stands up for him. Cathy is an asshole. Even if you were all just catering to his whims, it costs her nothing to just.. not press the play button. She did it to cause a scene because she's a bully.", "NTA. Why would you let her come over to be cruel to your grandson again? He\u2019s 7, he needs to feel safe in his home.", "Nta. You are merely protecting your grandson and enforcing your boundaries. Your daughter-in-law appears to be both jealous and ignorant. She needs to learn about autism before she starts spouting off about how you treat your grandson.", "NTA and thank you for standing up for your grandson.  Honestly, I don't know if I've ever seen anyone handle a situation like this better.  I'm particularly impressed that you had the presence of mind to take Cathy out of the room so that you weren't criticizing her in front of everyone.  I've been in a situation very similar to this more than once.  I don't think I was ever able to control myself enough to not embarrass the adult for their rude behavior.  Cathy should be mortified by her own behavior and grateful that you handled it gracefully.    \n\n\nI would guess that Cathy is getting exactly what she wants--she's isolating her husband from his family.  Stick firm to those boundaries.  She shouldn't be allowed in Travis' home, his safe space, until she apologizes TO HIM and promises to do better.  But make sure you keep reaching out to your son.  There's a red flag parade here.  If she dismisses the feelings of a seven-year-old, then she certainly does the same for her husband.  Make sure he knows that you still love and support him, but you won't allow Cathy to cross your boundaries without consequences.  And make sure he knows you'll be there to offer support when he needs it.  Chances are, he's definitely going to need it.", "NTA.  Purposely triggering an autistic kid because you're jealous of the \"attention\" he's getting is a 100% AH move and you should definitely hold firm on getting an apology directly from her to you (and your daughter and grandson) before she's allowed back.", "NTA. She sucks", "NTA She sounds like a child \"it's not fair Leah had a kid first\" what in the actual fuck. Stick to your guns until she's ready to grow up.", ">Her lack of remorse afterwards suggests that she would probably do something equally unpleasant again\n\nExactly why she shouldn't be allowed near Travis. Her behavior as an adult baffles me.", "It wasn\u2019t something that could be easily pressed. That\u2019s what makes this worse. She had to really search for the button and press hard.", "That\u2019s better than letting that sadistic woman back into their home.", "I understand this and have come to accept it.\n\nI love my younger 2 grandkids, but it\u2019s a double edged sword. If I don\u2019t protect Travis and Leah, Leah will in no doubt not want us around him either. So either way, we lose someone.\n\nIt\u2019ll break my heart and I\u2019ll hope for the day they return to our lives. And if it happens, I hope they understand but if they don\u2019t\u2026I just can\u2019t rationalize allowing Cathy around my grandson when she\u2019s so cruel.

Its developed over time, primarily during developmental years, unlikely as an adult\n\nOne can learn to mimic empathetic behavior and recognize what others would believe is the societal preferred course of action.  But that would have to be a conscious choice and tiring mask to keep up all the time.  \n\nCathy does not care enough about travis or in general i dont know.", "This was somewhat a point of contention when Leah got pregnant. Cathy and Daniel were dating at the time, with serious plans to marry. Cathy said she was a little disappointed that they wouldn\u2019t be the ones to give us our first grandchild as they were older. But we thought she got over it.", "We do have some family events at the house but don\u2019t begrudge Daniel if he doesn\u2019t come as Cathy isn\u2019t invited.
