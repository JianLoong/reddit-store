Use examples that are close tp her assignments in concept, but not the exact assignment (so she cannot use you to do them).  \nShe'll have to buck up and do the work herself.  \nOR  \nDo the assignment wrong (just in the simplest way) and ask her to tell you where you messed up, most students would be overjoyed to outsmart their tutor even pointing it out when you are in the process of making the \"mistake\". Again she will have to do the remainder of the assignment on her own.\n\nTutoring is not doing the work, but helping define the process in which the work is done.\n\nLet your parents know that this situation is causing YOU panic and making you struggle in other classes.\n\nIf she fails the course, that is on her, not you.", "I'm a trainer by profession, so I feel your pain here to a degree.  You can't teach someone who isn't motivated to learn and she clearly is not.  Dropping her cold turkey would be an AH move, but you can try one more time with a warning that it will be the last and you will be resigning since this clearly isn't working out.  Certainly you should stop doing her work for her.  Make her start one step at a time, digging her way through resource material for each and every step.  If she just throws up her hands and refuses, well, that's that.", "YWNBTA  And you NEED to do it.

A better way to handle it is to warn her now that you won\u2019t be doing her work for her, but will continue to tutor, in the real sense of the word.  Let her know this is really to prepare her for the final.  Ask her to do the work before logging into the session, then you can review it together.  Pick out certain concepts that are very challenging to review.  How will she pass a final unassisted if you don\u2019t tell her now?  Sounds like she won\u2019t anyway but let it be due to her own failings *after* you have given the opportunity to step up.  Set boundaries and expectations with those you tutor and it will be more enjoyable.  Good luck \ud83d\udc4d", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
