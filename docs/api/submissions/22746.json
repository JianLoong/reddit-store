They\u2019re not very involved. Despite living close, they only see my kids when I bring them over to visit; never calling to speak to them or ask how they\u2019re doing.\n\nA month prior, I sent a txt with the date, time & location of the event, suggesting they add it to their calendar. We visited them at their home a handful of times over the next few weeks. Each time, either myself or K would remind them of the upcoming event.\n\nThe last visit was 5 days prior. K once again reminded my mom who then looked to me and asked \u201cAre you going to remind me? If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll forget\u201d. She is 53 with no memory issues and a housewife with no responsibilities. She spends her days sleeping in and shopping. She never seems to forget her beauty appointments or store sales.\n\nI remind her of my busy week. I won\u2019t see her again until the day of. I tell them to add the recital to their calendar. I remind them to simply click on the text I sent and add it to their calendar. As a working mom also going back to school, I have enough responsibilities to remember as it is.\n\nThe day of the recital, I\u2019m running errands all morning when my mom calls. It was a less than a minute conversation about a piece of my mail that came to her by mistake. That was that.\n\nAfter work, I go to pick up my daughter from after school activities. Here I finally have a moment to pause. I silence my phone during work and went to turn the sound back on when I saw several missed calls & texts from my mom, each one getting more hostile. She\u2019s always been the type of person who gets upset when her messages aren\u2019t answered right away.\n\nShe invited us to dinner at her home that night. This was out of character because she rarely cooks. Yet, she made a three course meal and invited the whole family. Dinner was to start at the same time as the recital. Obviously they had forgotten about the recital. I didn\u2019t know how to take it or how to respond. I apologized for not seeing the message sooner, thanked her for the invite but said we will be at K\u2019s recital tonight.She instantly replied \u201cYOU DIDN\u2019T REMIND US LIKE I ASKED YOU TO\u201d.\n\nMy dad then called asking what time. I couldn\u2019t even respond because of my mom in the background yelling. Neither apologized for forgetting, despite the constant reminders. My mom made it clear this was my fault because I hadn\u2019t mentioned anything about it when she called me earlier that day.\n\nShe believed I intentionally didn\u2019t tell her because she thinks I didn\u2019t want her to be there. She name called and attacked my character until I cried. This enraged her further, as she mocked me for crying and accused me of faking it to gain my father\u2019s sympathy. It was only then that my father finally told her to stop talking and ended the call.", "created_utc": 1689865038, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154t87v/aita_for_not_reminding_them/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You reminded more than enough times & I doubt she forgot.  For your mom to blame you is narcissistic behavior.  It can't possibly be her fault.  How dare you not remind her.
