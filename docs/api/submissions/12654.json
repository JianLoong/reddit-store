I have depression, and I've never, ever thought it was OK, no matter how depressed I am, to not wipe my own filth off of myself. That was true when I was as single as could be, and is orders of magnitude more true when not and another person could be anywhere near there. \n\nI get that he's having a bad time, but that's just not an excuse to not clean yourself, and if he's unwilling to take the minimum amount of care of himself then he needs help that you probably can't and shouldn't give him.

To them, putting up with poor hygiene is proof a woman truly loves them. Also, they used weaponized incomp\u00e9tence to find women who would literally clean up after them so they left messes, never cleaned the bathroom, etc. Eww, eww, and  ewwwwwweee!", ">\tI made him feel embarrassed and that I always try to \u201cmother him.\u201d \n\nYou\u2019re not mothering him, he\u2019s acting like a child.\n\nThe only issue, from his perspective, is that you said something, and therefore embarrassed him. \n\nHis wish is that the next time this happens, you do not mention it. \n\nDo you see how crazy that is?", "NTA. You should dump this loser. Who does that? If I run out of toilet paper, I wash my ass in the shower with soap and hot water.\n\nHe obviously has no hygiene standards and you have no standards full stop if you stay with a dirtbag like this", "NTA-\n    I'm a germaphobe. That's disgusting. My partner needs base level hygiene. If they can't handle that and it's not from depression (if it is then they need to get help)...bye! \n    Here I thought I was TOO clean. I regularly smell like lavender and if I even get a wiff of butt sweat in the bathroom I freak out. I even went so far as to get butt deodorant to use on long days at work, during the summer and during my cycle just so I don't smell like butt crack sweat...eww just eww", "Wow absolutely NTA and also absolutely not to THAT asshole either, yikes \ud83d\udc40 \n\nIf you're still talking to him, can I just suggest for him wet wipes? Like, they make the world of difference if you're not a fan of the bidet or you have a landlord who's persnickety about installing one. Like... Idk you just get so much cleaner using those. They're not that expensive, and once you start using them it's hard to go back to uh rubbing your sensitive bits raw with paper. They're a lot easier to transport without ruining them like the roll of paper often gets crushed. I bring them and sanitizer everywhere I go.\n\nBut if you're past that point and just want out I totally get it too lol.", "NTA.", "NTA. If he's too depressed to clean the shit from his ass he needs serious professional help. That's disgusting", "Yuck- how does someone go out with a partner or caring of their hygiene? And if he always uses the weed as a clutch every time he gets depressed, this will be your life!", "NTA.

But weed smoking and bad hygiene have nothing to do. He's just gross.", "NTA intimacy should come without be assaulted with the smell of shit.

Most of these guys though don't follow instructions, and wash themselves like a normal shower not scrubbing anywhere. So there's still inches of hard ass crap still stuck to them. Or a ton of hardened dick cheese hidden under their foreskin. \n\nBecause they habitually never clean these areas! It shows! It's months worth of buildup sometimes, like how? \n\nI usually talk them down as I'm cleaning them before they are transported to surgery.

Grown coherent adult men shouldn't be having diaper rashes", "What kind of job is that?!", "These men just refuse to clean their peri-area. They give me a myriad of excuses of why they can't wash their ass/balls/penis. Like it's \"unmanly\", it's \"gay\", or \"it's clean enough, the wife don't mind\".

We know we have to and support each other to stay healthy. But we don't make each other put up with our fecal matter ever. Getting a little sweaty with messy hair because of a bad week is one thing, not making sure you have a clean asshole is close to needing institutional help in my opinion. He's putting you and himself at risk at this point because that's a health hazard right there. Fecal matter is a biohazard for a reason you can get horribly sick from it getting into your body and by the activities your mentioned it's very possible. \n\nPlease understand what he did wasn't just not taking care of his hygiene but put you at risk for a whole slew of diseases and illnesses.", "NTA hygiene is always a huge indicator of mental health issues.  Obviously sometimes those with depression don\u2019t shower or brush their teeth.  But having fecal matter on them is a big red flag of a bigger issue.

He is embarrassed you mentioned his lack of hygiene BUT was totally able to be turned on with your face in his shitty ass knowing full well he walks around like this in public trying to get someone to go down on him.

As someone who suffers with a rigamorole of things, the amount of arm chair diagnosing as opposed to just, no, that\u2019s not okay regardless of mental health, is insane. Okay, in a perfect world, it\u2019d solely be dependent on mental health, but even so, not a good reason. Accountability and all that. Yes, I know depression is bad, yes, I understand sometimes you don\u2019t care, but it\u2019s not an excuse. \n\nAlso, people seem really quick to diagnose without recognizing there are just some ridiculous and lazy people in this world.
