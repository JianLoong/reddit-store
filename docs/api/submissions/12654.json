Please know that no matter how many people comment on here to say \u201caw depression is hard,\u201d that it\u2019s actually\u2026 not okay at all to walk around literally caked in your own feces. That\u2019s not simply depression (which I\u2019ve been clinically diagnosed with, in addition to two neurological disabilities and a physical disability). That\u2019s someone who needs serious help \u2014 and not from you! His behavior is not normal and you \u201cembarrassing him\u201d is simply his way of gaslighting you into having boundaries about literal $hit-stained seggsytimes. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing. \n\nThere\u2019s dudes out there who would never just not wipe their butt and then initiate seggs.\n\nSo you could be with a dude like that.

Girl.\n\nDump the fucker.\n\nHe tried to fuck you with literal shit still on his ass. He could have given you an infection, even leaving aside how absolutely gross that is. You feel like you have to \"mother\" him when he smokes weed.\n\nYou can do so much better.\n\nNTA, and you should not have hid your revulsion.", "NTA - he was just embarrassed, but really walking around without wiping after going #2 is pretty icky. But to then engage in adult activities while it still hasn't been cleaned up.....wth.", "NTA, if he wants to get frisky he needs to cater to your needs. That means not smelling like poop. It's not your fault to be turned off by poop smells.", "I don\u2019t think you can be a whole lot more tactful if you\u2019re smelling literal shit when you go down. He\u2019s right, you shouldn\u2019t have to mother him. He needs to clean his ass. NTA.", "Dudes out here with full swamp ass skids. NTA. Since when does smelling shit during a blowie and deeply questioning it mean you are \u201cmothering?\u201d Yeeeee.", "NTA  \nThe AH here is the one who went to the bathroom and then didn't wipe or shower and then allowed you to put your face that close. He was insanely disrespectful towards **you.** Being clean before intimacy is like baseline respect for your partner. He should be embarrassed, not because you said something, but because he should be ashamed of his actions. \n\nNot trying to be dismissive of his struggle with depression, I can absolutely understand how a depressive episode can effect even very basic self care, but that doesn't make it acceptable for him to put you in that position and then blame you for speaking up for yourself.", "NTA. The best way to avoid the embarrassment of your girlfriend telling you that you smell like shit is to wipe your ass and wash it properly lmfao. Sounds like you were pretty tactful.", "NTA. \n\nI know guys aren\u2019t the best at being prepared when it comes to running out of stuff like toilet paper, hand soap, and other hygiene stuff.

If your partner is has mental health stuff\u2026 that can be tough. But he also needs to deal with it. It kind of sounds like he isn\u2019t. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s embarrassed but that\u2019s not your fault. It sounds like you were pretty nice about the whole thing. \n\nTo be completely honest though, OP, I can\u2019t imagine dating a guy who would even run out of toilet paper, let alone the rest of your story. Part of being an adult is making sure you have TP in the house, you know? Bills are paid, mental health and hygiene are taken care of, and you have things like toilet paper, toothpaste, soap\u2026 There are plenty of people out there who have never once in their lives run out of TP and even if they did, would probably utilize the nearby sink or shower to help with cleanup. \n\nAnyway, I wish you both luck but you\u2019re definitely NTA.", "NTA. \nAsking someone to literally clean their shit isn't a mom behavior it's personal hygiene. Ew he's grown enough to be a boyfriend but isn't grown enough to clean himself. That's disgusting. There's no excuse for all of this. He needs to act like a grown man for once. Weed is a bad habit of course but not cleaning yourself is so disgusting.", "NTA that's just fucking foul! \ud83e\udd22", "NTA. He - a grown adult - failed to wipe his own ass clean.

He seriously tried to write this thing off by saying you \"mother\" him???\n\nYou didn't embarass him - he embarassed himself.\n\nIf he does have mental health issues, he needs to deal with that. You're kind to be supportive, but he could've easily given you an infection due to his lack of hygiene + attempted to engage in intimate acts with you despite his lack of hygiene.\n\nYou can support him, but when it comes to this kind of thing OP, I beg you -- please, put yourself first. If need must be, be \"selfish\" (but to be clear \"poor hygiene means no sex\" is NOT a selfish boundary--it's literally for your own safety).", "A man should know how to clean his ass.", "NTA", "NTA. He literally had shit in his asscrack, ran out of toilet paper and just didn't wipe. You're dating skidmark boy. Did all that shit not cause him to have itchy butt syndrome?? Because fr you see guys digging in their butt cracks sometimes and you know it's because they don't know how to wipe right. Maybe I'm being the AH for saying that but at least I know mine is wiped.", "NTA you weren\u2019t trying to be mean about it but even if you were\u2026 he needs to know better. \n\nThat being said, sometimes with mental health you need to come up with alternative solutions when something is too hard to do (like remembering to buy tp) instead of just ignoring the problem. Time for dude to get a bidet.", "NTA and that has nothing to do with depression. The man straight up didn't wipe his own ass after he defecated. That's just gross and unhygienic. Then he initiated sex with you with literal poop on him. UGH! That is straight up break up action right there.", "NTA you were a lot kinder than I would have been. Just a warning that you can get all kinds of infection from that, it really could be terrible for you. \n\nIt's sweet that you're looking out for him and trying to be understanding but someone needs to look out for you too. Him not showering and literally being caked in poop can give you UTIs and infections. As much as you're looking out for his health he should be looking out for yours too.", "NTA. Girl there are literally toddlers and animals with better hygiene than this man. Please leave him.", "NTA\n\nThis is disgusting", "NTA, if he ran out of toilet paper he could go use a goddamn paper towel or a wash cloth. \n\nYou had every right to ask him to wash up. You deserve better.", "Ewwwwww disgusting... NTA", "Was he too stoned or too depressed to wipe his ass or hop in the shower?? This feels like common courtesy to me. If you're old enough to have sex you're old enough to know if your ass and balls need some soap and water before your partner *puts them in her mouth*. It's really kind of gross to me that people don't shower before oral to begin with but this is another level cuz dude has reason to believe his ass was dirty.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
