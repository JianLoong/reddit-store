{"id": 29651, "submission_id": "17g4m7y", "title": "AITAH for asking husband to wake up with the baby?", "selftext": "Throwaway for obvious reasons. Really constrained by the 3000 limit, I posted the fuller story with better context in another group. Husband & I have 3 children. 1m, 3m, 7f. I'm a SAHM, he works a normal 9 to 5, & helps his dad at the family farm when needed during harvest season. \n\nYesterday was a chaotic day in general. All in all, a lot of driving, over stimulation, & routine disruption. 3m is neurodivergent, & any change can be very unsettling. Because of this he was more destructive & food avoidant, & didn't nap.\n\nHusband called at 4:30 to say his dad needed help for a few hours. Then calls later & said his dad doesn't want him to quit until he finishes the field. I know it's not all the time so I just roll with it. But it's a tough night. Boys don't want to share the tub during bath time for the first time, so they fight a lot. 1m is screaming & chasing me around like a duckling if I'm not holding him. 7f needs help with homework, no one ate dinner well enough so they're all hangry right before bed.\n\nHusband is normally home to help with dinner & bed. It's what 3m is used to. Dad always does his routine. So me doing it with no warning caused a 1.5 hour meltdown. 1m wanted to be rocked & snuggled, again out of the ordinary. I finally got everyone to bed. Picked up the house, did the dishes, switched the laundry, had a plate ready for when husband got home. I was EXHAUSTED & so touched out. My anxiety was up from the stress, I just wanted to go to sleep. Went to bed at 10.\n\nHusband came home at 10:30. Showered, ate, then woke me up to try & instigate adult time. I told him no, he went off in a huff to play video games. Came back to bed at 2 & promptly fell asleep. \n\n1m woke up at 3 am annoyed by his cold. I changed him, gave him medicine, tried to give him a bottle, snuggled him, let him play in his room. He wanted nothing. After 1hr I put him back in his crib to see if he could self soothe. Another hr goes by of random goofing to more upset sounds. I decide to wake up husband to give it a try. \n\nHe BLEW UP at me. Said he was too tired, why did I wake him up if I already was, why can't I just ignore youngest or turn off the monitor, he worked all day why should he have to. The monitor talk made me the most mad. We live in a big house, the kids are on the other side. I was in a *minor house fire when I was younger, and it causes me a lot of anxiety at night still. Having the video/ sound monitors brings me extra peace knowing I can see and hear my kids. Youngest also tends to stretch through and get stuck in the crib slats. I'm a light sleeper so I wake up to them sniffling, while husband can sleep through a tornado. He was sleeping through youngests whole ordeal, while I was kept up, so I understand that side of it, that I was already awake. But I had basically been a solo parent for 20 hours straight, I was touched out and mentally exhausted. He eventually got up and dealt with baby, who drank a full bottle and fell asleep in 15 minutes.\n\nETA for a few common comments: more info in other post as well\n\n\u2022 FIL does pay him. We both discussed and agreed at the beginning of harvest to him providing help when needed. FIL has 3 farm hands and the one digging had to leave early. I knew at the beginning they were a family farm. Husband is at a place in work/life where he can and wants to start helping more to eventually possibly taking over. \n\n\u2022 He was in an office all day, which was slow according to him. Then he went to an air conditioned auto steer tractor that only has to be managed when turning or checking on something. People out here acting like he hand dug a 100 acre field by hand in 100 degree weather. Yes he had a long day. I was up from 6 am with the kids, so one could argue I also had a 15 hour day.\n\n\u2022We had been in communication all day. We knew how each other's days had been. He had an easy office day and felt bad that I was stressed and busy. We both agreed on the dig because we thought it would only be a couple of hours. \n\n\u2022He wasn't aggressive or mad when he woke me up. All I said was no, I'm too tired. He huffed and hawed in a general disappointment way and left the room to let me go back to bed. He was too wired to fall asleep right away so thought he would play for a half hour. He didn't keep track of time and said it literally flew by and couldn't believe he played for almost 3 hours.

TBH, he doesn\u2019t have a clue you have a full time job too, or he wouldn\u2019t have gotten into a huff after you declined adult time or \u201cblown up at you\u201d after you asked him for help. I hope he can become more helpful to you, BUT I don\u2019t see it. I would bet his family is all the same, as are his friends.", "NTA. I'm really miffed that he woke you up expecting you to be happy about it but then when you wake him up he wonders how you have the nerve to disturb his slumber. He is also an asshole for using work as a reason not to get up as if he hadn't been up all night playing video games. \n\nI understand there is more nuance and I'm not calling him a bad husband or father, but in this situation he acted selfishly which makes him an asshole in the moment.", "NTA. Unless his dad is paying him to work on that farm, he needs to stop. Sounds like he's going there just to avoid his responsibilities at home.", "NTA\n\nYou are BOTH responsible for those children. Yes, he works during the day, but you work (for free) to ensure the children are safe and happy, the shopping is done, the food is cooked, the house is clean....etc all whilst looking after yourself. You need to have a break and your husband needs to step up. He could have also gone to bed early if he didnt sit there playing video games till 2am.\n\nAlso also, you're husband is very selfish to WAKE YOU UP, after coming home late, and doing nothing tl help with the kids, so his \"needs\" can be satisfied. It's disgusting.", "NTA - I might be kinda blinded by my culture here because SAHM isn't really common where I live so I might not be totally aware of the unwritten rules about the concept. \n\nBut his comment about being tired because he was at work all day really ticks me off. As if being home alone with three children with different needs is a walk in the park and doesn't require any amount of energy at all. And don't even get me started on his suggestion to just turn the monitor off and just let your baby cry out loud for an entire night (and be tired the entire day after that as a result). So yes. Huuuuge NTA. \n\nHis attitude towards you being a SAHM sounds kinda rotten and entitled  like he's not required to contribute at all because he's working, and like he refuses to understand that taking care of children all day is a full time job. It's a litteral profession for nannys, daycare workers etc. And the job will definetly not be easier when both parent and child don't sleep. I MIGHT be over interpreting here (and I don't know if this is a one time incident or something that happens on a regular basis), but his attitude really annoys be - especially because he obviously have time to play video games but take care of his own child? Naaaah.   \n\n\nSorry about the rant.", "NTA. A grown ass man doesn't stay up til 2am playing video games and then is \"too tired\" to take care of his child that his wife has cared for all day. He sounds awful, TBH.", "NTA. When tf does he plan to parent? His dad needing help doesn\u2019t change his responsibilities to his kids at home. So you\u2019re supposed to be \u201con\u201d mommy duty 24hrs because his dad needs help? Seriously?", "Let me see if I'm understanding: your husband woke you up to have sex, you declined without shouting. Hours later you woke your husband to take care of his child and he blew up at you? Very much **NTA**.", "NTA and he owes you an apology. Personally, I would set the expectation that you don\u2019t want to be woken up for sex. I told my husband years ago that I do not ever want to be woken up in the middle of the night for that sort of thing, and he\u2019s always respected that. If you\u2019re generally fine with it and just didn\u2019t want to this time, that\u2019s totally fine though. \n\nBut he owes you a major apology for yelling at you when all you did was ask him to be present as a father to his own child. If he wants to game instead of sleeping, he needs to accept that he might be tired if he has to get up with the baby. But he still has to get up. \n\nIf he is choosing to let his side gig (the farm) and his hobby (gaming) come before his primary obligation\u2014his children\u2014he needs to rethink his choices.", "Sheesh, all these negative comments about the husband. Im betting most of these comments are from people who have never worked on a farm.\n\nThe husband is working two jobs essentially. People keeps saying that his dad can hire more farm hands. Sure he can, and that money would go to them, not his son and his respective family. \n\nWe dont know what husbands regular job is or how much he makes. So if he is picking up extra hours on his dads farm, then he likely isnt bringing home the big bucks.\n\nThat doesnt excuse him being a jerk, but working hard all day for two jobs should at least earn him some good will here. Three kids is a lot to manage, but it costs a lot too, especially with one person earning for the whole household.\n\nHusband does need to understand that sometimes he will have to get up for the babies. That is life. But OP isnt the only one that can be stressed out while raising three kids.\n\nI say no AHs here. Just this is life. These are some of the stresses of raising families. It will get better, especially when the kids get older.... (granted they turn into different problems... teenagers... gross! LOL)", "NTA. It\u2019s easy to be mad he stayed up playing video games, but he also can\u2019t be responsible for not knowing what wasn\u2019t communicated about the stress of your day, that you need extra help because you\u2019re also exhausted and that it was a terrible night to stay up gaming. But the same goes for him, he shouldn\u2019t have reacted so poorly when you asked for help, esp since he already knew you were too tired for adult time. \n\nIt was a perfect storm of you both being at your limits. Maybe you can have a code for when either of you are at peak, like just text \u201cdefcon 1\u201d and that can mean \u201cbe prepared\u201d so you\u2019ll both be ready to be a bit more generous with each other.", "NTA. \n\nYour husband probably did not know you were so shattered when he woke you up. Or that you had such a rough day with the kids. HOWEVER, if my partner were to sleep so early, I would have thought they were really tired or unwell and let them sleep instead of waking them for sexy time. \n\nIt was immature of him to storm off to play video games till 2am, knowing fully well you are a light sleeper and have young kids to tend to. Or snapping at you for asking for help. He chose to have the kids too. He should chip in. Plus he didn\u2019t seem to mind not having enough sleep for sexy time or video games. Why is lack of sleep for taking care of his kids an issue? \n\nHave a chat with him about the day you had and tell him you didn\u2019t appreciate his lack of consideration and him blowing up on you. As a caregiver to three young children, your mental health is very important. If he can\u2019t support you, at least try not to cause more anxiety and stress!", "You both are stressed out. You both didn't want to be woken up by the other. You both are either assholes or not assholes, it is not one or the other of you.

Dad can hire a farm hand to help out, otherwise mom needs to hire a mother\u2019s helper!", "His \"needs\" didnt get satisfied. And as it should be.\n\nOf course he is being selfish. What guy wouldnt want to come home to his wife after a long day of work and hope to get lucky with her. But he was a jerk, and got shut down. Welcome to marriage.\n\nSo he came home and went to play some video games. He had a long day and is doing something to help wind down. This was his option B after getting shut down by OP. He still needs to get up and go right back to work the next day.\n\nA stay at home mom does not work for free. She works for the family. All of the things she does, is the stuff that needs to be done while husband (or partner) is going off to work for the money that pays for everything. NOTE: Im not saying that he gets to control everything because its his money, as it is the family money. Instead, SAHM spends that money, on groceries and other stuff, for the family. \n\nThere is a balance here. Both have their rolls, and neither should be treated like one has it harder than the other.

All we know is he woke her and she said no.\n\nWhen two people agree to become parents, they take on that burden together. You may have seen it as her being selfish for waking him but I see it as her asking him for help because she was being unsuccessful. It was a good thing too because he was able to do it in 15 minutes while she was at it for more than twice as long. \n\nAlso, she claims he blew up at her. I wouldn't set that aside as mere grumbling.", "If he's not paying him enough to buy you some damn help, then it ain't worth it.", "Are you the husband because you're defending him like you have a fetish for him?", "Different people wind down in different ways. Some people, even though may have had a long, stressful or tiring day, they may still need have some wind down time.\n\nOPs husband may have had a long day, but it may not have been \"absolutely\" so. We dont have those details though. Just worked two jobs, came home and attempted to get some nookie with the wife. Failing that last bit, he went off to play some games. \n\nHe might have been stewing a bit on the rejection longer than he should have, but we dont have his input here.", "Almost like he wanted to unwind after a long day\u2026. How crazy", "That's the problem with a character limit. You have to leave a lot of stuff out. We had talked throughout the day and his farming about how long/stressful our days were.

He blew his chance with option A.\n\nMost people need something to help them wind down and crash for the night. Some solutions are sex and then bed. Others watch TV or play video games. \n\nWhat wasnt very bright was how he behaved to loose his option A.", "Exactly. A character limit leaves a lot to the imagination and people fill in the blanks with what they want to think happened. Being annoyed and screaming at your partner are 2 completely different things. I tried to deal with the baby on my own, and needed to tap out and ask my partner for help. Him blowing up at me for a full 5 minutes, laying in bed pouting and ignoring the baby until I asked again, and then taking 10 minutes to get up, go to the bathroom, make a bottle, and walk up 10 steps isn't doing as asked or just grumbling. But again, added context helps.", "He does have 3 farm hands. But they're older men FIL's age. Husband has expressed interest in being more involved in the farm, so it's something they both want.

Wife did that, despite all the crazyness. If he wanna \"play\", he can stop playing games and \"satisfy his needs\" with his own hand. That, or help his wife with his own children. He worked all day?? So did she!!!", "Oh that poor baby who got a \"no\" after his wife had a hectic day, and he knew about her day. Who asks for sex when you know your wife had so much on her plate? Just use your hands.\nAlso playing for that long is on him, he knows he has young children who will most likely wake up at night. So yes, unwinding is important, but he should know better. Both parents are tired, if he is asked to soothe a child after she tried for an hour, there's no discussion to be had.", "Ah yes, because his wife doesn't deserve sleep so he can unwind. Got it.", "When did she get to unwind?", "Cool so you know he was stressed too and you\u2019re actively holding it against him when he let it go and tended to his kids after you woke him up", "I never said he didnt have an obligation to help out. I said the opposite.\n\nWeather he grumbled or threw a tantrum like one of your children, he still went and did it. Im not excusing behavior for him. But he doesnt get to tap out.\n\nHe came home, woke you, and he got rejected. We know what your day was like, but not his. Im not saying they are equal, but just because you dont have enough room to go into full detail doesnt mean that he is in the wrong for being in a foul mood after he gets home late. \n\nHis behavior sucks, yes. But am I wrong in assuming he has to get up and go back to work? Does he get to tap out to that? He has two jobs.

Came home wanting sex, and then pouted when she was tired and not in the mood since, you know, kids hanging on you all day is super.

She tried to get the baby to sleep while he slept through it all, and she deals with mom-hearing, which means practically no sleep at any movement or sound through the night.

He certainly shouldn't have blown up at you for asking for support, especially if you've been dealing with the kids all day, that's full time job particularly when one is neurodivergent. \n\nYou should speak to him about it, maybe you could get a rota going of nights he's to get up to give you time to rest and nights he can stay up until late? \n\nHope you get some good sleep soon! You sound like a great mum.", "NTA!!", "NTA. Nothing more to add that hasn\u2019t been said. Just NTA.", "NTA\n\nIn the interests of devils advocate, did he know how your day went, or did he find out the next day? Guys can be oblivious, and the adult time idea suggests he may not have known you had a day from hell", "So he worked all day, then worked on the farm?", "NAH, just a really rough day for all.", "ESH. It\u2019s tough to handle 3 kids alone and it\u2019s tough to work a day like your husband did. That\u2019s why some people sensibly have zero, one, or two children only instead of overextending themselves into relentless misery.", "NTA, both parents are responsible for the well being of their children.  Also sometimes babies are just attention seeking and don't actually have any issues. The more you respond to their meaningless cries, the more they will do it. It's okay to not respond in those situations.", "This is a genuine question: I so often see this kind of post and it always includes a problem with the bath time ritual being really tiring/ exhausting/ disruptive.\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just a coincidence with those situations arising on a night kids get bathed or whether so many parents bathe their babies/ toddlers/ young kids DAILY. To me it sounds like the latter.\n\nIt\u2019s NOT RECOMMENDED to bathe babies/ toddlers/ young children daily, it\u2019s NOT GOOD for them. The official guideline is to bathe them two, maximum three times per week:\n\n https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-often-should-your-kids-take-a-bath-or-shower/amp/\n\nApart from that OP is NTA, of course.", "You are letting the kids run the house. Until you get control, this is going to keep happening. You are a young mother, which means you can still influence the childrens behavior. lean to say no. learn to use punishment. Learn not to beg your kids to behave. Learn to give them ONE CHANCE. Lean to follow through on threats immediately. YOU are supposed to be in charge. If you are, temper tantrums are rare, and short lived. Right now you have chaos and you have got to unwind it.", "Nta", "100% this^. This level of selfishness is absolutely baffling to me. If this is unusual behaviour from him then it's time for a serious talk. If it isn't then that is really sad and I hope OP realises this isn't normal or acceptable behaviour from a spouse", "He did know. In another subreddit she said they have been communicating all day and he knew about her struggles that day. He is a selfish AH", "He's still responsible for his children and sharing the load when home. He gave her no slack, so why should he be granted the same?", "He sat in an office all day. He wasn't digging trenches.", "This sub has a 3000 character limit for posts which means a lot of time people have to leave things out of their posts", "No one is going to post about all the days the bath went well. \"I bathed my baby for the third time this week and we played with ducks. I took the blue duck away from her and she got mad. AITA?\"\n\nBaths usually happen in the evening. Children get tired in the evening. Being tired makes them act up. That's it.\n\nAlso small children get gross, you know. Like actually covered in physical dirt and grime. That's not good for them either. Plus baths are often recommended as a way to help young children settle down before bed and to keep up a consistent routine.", "Kids aren\u2019t robots awaiting commands, and it is unrealistic to expect them to obey like this comments suggests. Kids have needs and feelings that change from day to day. Good parents like OP show up with both firmness AND compassion, not like parenting is a military drill. Parenting with \u201ccontrol\u201d in mind leaves kids traumatized and parents feeling constant shame for not being able to meet unrealistic expectations.", "...one of their kids is a year old and another is neurodivergent. That's not how any of this works.", "No. Their children are the responsibility of both parents, including their father. His want for sex is not his wife\u2019s responsibility.", "He woke her up because he wanted to get laid.\n\nShe woke him up because his child needed him.\n\nYeah, totally the same thing.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

HE chose to stay up all night playing video games.", "Didn't OP do #1 too?", "OP, do I read correctly that your husband woke you up because od his dick, went to bed late because of video games, and refused to help when HIS kids are in distress? Wow. He really is an AH.\n\nYou are NTA", "As far as sharing the load, I never said or implied otherwise.\n\nHe gave her no slack? Try neither one of them gave the other slack. They should both ease up.\n\nShe had a stressful day with the kids, and he worked at two different jobs. I have acknowledged that he behaved poorly, but we dont have context about his day, only hers, and everybody is treating him like the bad guy.\n\nThree kids is a lot of work. So is two jobs. Im not saying excuse his poor behavior, but that doesnt mean he didnt have just as hard of a day as her. \n\nHe came home to her. he got rejected by her (again, she had no obligation to his attempt for sex). He still had to help out with the child. Yes its part of being a husband/father. It was me trying to say give the man some slack. He cant defend himself here.\n\nAnd Im not trying to give crap to OP. I did say \"No AHs here.\"", "Are you saying that office work isnt work, or isnt stressful? That he did nothing? And even if so, what about the second job working for his dad on dad's farm?\n\nWe can say not all work is equal, but real work is still real work. \n\nAnd before anybody freaks out, I am also saying being a SAHM is real work!", "Right? He wasn\u2019t woken up for her, he was woken up to take part in his shared responsibility.", "He probably puts his dick first before family as well", "I never said or implied otherwise. \n\nIm all over this thread. Ive worked hard to try to clarify. I hope that will help.", "It was his turn with the kids. Kids are both parents' responsibility.", "Thank you for clarifying and I can see what you are saying.", "I should also note that OP has now added extra context to her post that wasnt originally there. Most of my comments are based on the original, unedited post.", "Ah, okay. In that case, I side more with NTA.", "You cannot compare a 9 to 5 followed  by a second job til 10.30 pm with staying at home taking care of your own kids.", "You are never entitled to sex, even when you decide to marry.\n\nHowever, once you have kids, you take on an unfailing obligation to them. You don't stop being a parent because you are sick, or tired.\n\nOP did her fair share of dealing with the kids.\n\nIf you have a spouse and kids - I feel bad for them.", "The act of waking someone to get them to do something, can be equated. Im not saying the ask has to be equal in nature. I have also stated multiple times, OP was under no obligation (read well within her right to say NO), and her husband does need to help out with the kids.\n\nI think both worked hard for the day. She lost control of the kids and got stressed. He came home wanting to get laid, got shut down, went off to play video games. \n\nThey have three kids. THREE (3)!!! \n\nThis has happened before. It is going to happen again, probably with different nuances.\n\nOP is stress out and posting in here looking for sympathy. Her husband may have acted poorly, but he is getting thrown under the bus here, and he cant give his side of the story. My answer is: This is what you get for getting married and having kids. The more I read this stuff, I imaging OP looks like Amber Heard! -- Yeah Yeah Downvote me!", "I actually said OP does not have an obligation to sex. Seriously, please re-read. I have said this multiple times in this thread.\n\nMy wife read this. She laughed!", "Well good for her, all tastes are in the world!", "My wife has great taste! She is awesome! A couple of the many reasons I married her and have been with her for over twenty-five years!\n\nI do note your sarcasm though."]}
