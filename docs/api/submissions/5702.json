Nothing for doctors- we were also left out the department secret Santa, gifts from department and everything else. I am embarrassed but I was tired and otherwise sad and I just cried.

That\u2019s not okay.", "NTA in the slightest I'm so sorry OP.\n\nI'm not trying to jump on my own soap box from your post but I personally can't stand most of the RNs and such positions that I've had the \"pleasure\" of interacting with over the years as a patient.\n\nI don't know what's happened to the general attitudes with nurses over the years, but so many I've interacted with act like the last thing they want to do is interact directly with a patient no matter how polite that patient is trying to be (when they're in pain no less). And then they turn around and act like M.D.s are the bane of their existence too? It doesn't track for me, and I feel less sympathetic when they start going on about how they have it the hardest in the entire medical field as a justification for this widespread shift in attitude and atmosphere?\n\nA year ago, I got a thunderclap headache with no prior indication that I was having a health issue and collapsed on the floor screaming from some of the worst pain I had ever experienced in a matter of seconds. It happened a few hours before a final exam just to make things extra fun for me. So I'm driven to the ER and the first nurse triaging me looks me dead in the eye and snaps, \"Stop crying over a little headache. You're an adult, act like it.\" I was so scared of how people were going to treat me from that point on in the ER because I wasn't sure if people would even believe I have a legitimate reason to be in such distress? 2nd nurse in this situation wasn't much better. She sets up an IV telling me she's giving me something to calm me down. Then just leaves without telling me what it is when I ask. I don't know what kind of side effect hit me, but I felt like I couldn't breathe. I was gasping for air and barely getting out cries for help. Nurse comes back in and just says, \"calm down\" and just walks away again. I lay there for what felt like another ten minutes and in far greater distress than when I came in before I passed out. It didn't calm me down in the slightest, unless one could argue that me passing out from feeling so lightheaded and unable to breathe counts as calming me down.\n\nWho was the person here that made me feel like a human being worthy of some decency and advocacy? The ER doctor. He woke me up so gently. Despite clearly being busy he took the time to speak to me very slowly and answered every question I had without treating me like I was some hysterical non-patient. He explained every single test they were doing on me and applauding me for coming in when I did because I actually did have a serious headache and it was important to check for things like a brain bleed. I told him that the \"calming cocktail\" was scaring me and that the nurse was scaring me. He took care of it immediately for me. Later on he came back with some snacks for me that I think he may have gotten from the vending machine himself and gave me a prescription in which he explained every component to me himself. He then came back with a list of doctors for me to contact to follow up with to be fully screened later on.\n\nThis was just one personal experience. I could write a whole book about bad experiences with nurses, from the time a nurse gave me neuralgia by sticking a needle directly through a nerve in my arm and I had to take medication for the pain for over a year to cope, to the very very long list of incidents I had with nurses mistreating my mother because she was disabled and couldn't speak.\n\nYou don't deserve to be treated poorly or excluded for not being a nurse. It takes some serious audacity and apathy to make doctors throw in their money by giving them the impression they're included just to exclude them to get their kicks in.", "They are aholes for publicly shaming you and not sharing. It sounds like the doctors were pitching in to provide a treat to the nurses - which is nice and I understand you didn\u2019t know.\n\nI cannot understand people who would rather exclude someone and deny a slice of pie to a coworker who is hungry and down.", "NTA. The world sucks bad and sometimes it manifests itself in ways that make it painfully obvious that it indeed sucks because people suck. \n\nEven if you misunderstood the pizza situation - where is the compassion?", "Where are you based. I'll buy you a pizza. NTA. Message me and we can try and sort sommat. Im about to go into labour but we can sort something I'm sure..Happy holidays x", "NTA, and sorry they were so heartless towards you. You didn't deserve that treatment.", "NTA.

Did you not tell her that you\u2019d contributed to the cost of the pizza? How much did you pay? You may be at the very start of your medical career but believe me, you\u2019ll learn not to tolerate such crappy behaviour as you get more senior", "NTA. Nurses are generally not nice people. I know there are exceptions, but male bullies grow up and are disproportionately cops...and female bullies grow up and are disproportionately nurses. The nurse I work with at the school has said much the same, as have former nurses who now teach and that I interact with. They all have gotten out of the field after dealing with abusive coworkers, zero exceptions. You've now discovered this little gem of a nurse.  Take a few moments to speak with other doctors about her unprofessional behavior and see if this is something she does to every new doctor or if she's just being spiteful to you. Ask experienced doctors that you trust how to deal with this...and I would honestly take it to HR.  You were either set up as a chance to get $ from a doctor and abuse them, or there's a major disconnect between the nurse that asked you and the one that berated you.", "Oh lovely im sorry. Find a department or specialty with less clique and more... Actual teamwork. Promise some of us would appreciate you and enjoy your company. That's just miserable.", "NTA. Find a new job.", "NTA sounds like a hostile work environment tbh..", "NTA.\n\nIm so sorry this happened to you, I know the feeling were you are burned out, alone, away from family, tired and hungry.\n\nBetter days will come.", "Honestly I would have demanded my money back.", "NTA I have had full hangry meltdowns before in public. \n\nAt least it wasn't one of those.", "NTA. You threw money in. They are assholes and very disrespectful.", "Wow\u2026 NTA\u2026 please don\u2019t let this put you off.

You\u2019re not some doctor who treated the nurses some type of way over the years. You\u2019re new and working on Christmas.

Please fuck this whole institution and go elsewhere.\n\nVery much NTA.", "NTA and I totally get that. I would have cried, too. It's not about the pizza. It's about exclusion and exhaustion. \n\nThere are so many initiatives on how to foster belonging and inclusion for employers but I am not surprised at this nurse's behavior. Nurses like this are far too common. \n\nIt's so bad that my job is to train health care providers on those kinds of soft skills like inclusion, belonging, joy, and recognizing bias.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not enough anal mucous.\u201d  The chem teacher poured ranch dressing on the sleeve of a physics teacher in a fight about the shared space in the lab equipment locker.", "So as someone who has never worked in the field, I don't understand why doctors have such crazy shifts. Yeah, time to time, it makes sense that a surgery or emergency would keep a doctor at the hospital for 12 hours, but otherwise, why can't they work a more humane 8 hour day? Personally, I'd rather my doctor be well-rested and not be completely burned out.", "Your username checks out for this thread lol", "Is OP a resident? That didn't seem clear from the post.", "in my experience, thats true. of the people i know that are nurses, its like a 70/30 split of ones that are terrible/ones that are not. the ones that are actually good people have massive mean girl like issues with the nurses they work with. its a stereotype for a reason.", "Are you joking right now? \n \nYou do realize OP is still a human being right? With the same need for connection and professional community as any other person? \n \nJust because OP is eventually going to make more money doesn\u2019t mean shit when it comes to being excluded, or being treated like a person. \n \nYou need a reality check yourself here. \n \nNTA", "Are you a nurse or something? Because this comes off super defensive. What an unbelievably cruel thing to say to someone going through a tough time by no fault of their own, no matter what their profession is. \u201cA golden ticket to a life of riches\u201d following years of schooling, residency, and the financial burden that comes with all those things, is not nearly as easy as you make it sound. Have a little empathy for someone clearly being iced out by rude, cliquey people. Nurses work hard too, but they aren\u2019t saints.", "Completely agree!", "I am giving OP my judgement that crying at work over not getting a piece of pizza makes him/her an asshole. It's fine if you disagree. But that is my judgement. Feel free to leave your own.", "Oh yeah! Some you can literally locate from the patchouli smell coming down the hall! \ud83d\ude02", "Two of my high school English teachers both disclosed that they joined the military as teens for the free college & chose to become teachers based around following the Grateful Dead in the summer. They were the best teachers I had in high school & apparently they got married sometime after I graduated.", "The main reason (as far as I know, not a doctor) is trying to reduce the frequency at which the shift changes and responsibility is handed over. Those moments can be the riskiest, and there\u2019s a lot of time involved in making sure the new person on shift knows their responsibilities, what\u2019s been happening over the past twelve hours, getting up to date on developments with patients. While handover is happening and the new shift leaders are getting a handle on the situation, info can be lost and mistakes can be made", "Lol right?!", "Based on \u201cvery new doctor\u201d, a comment about the nurses making more money than them, and a comment referencing \u201cmy attending\u201d, I made the assumption that they were.", "The person you responded to is the ready for administration.", "She wants a nurse to support her and be her work mommy because she misses her family at Christmas. There's a close to 100% that OP is a white girl from a wealthy family and the nurses she's beefing are mostly women of colour.", "I think it was less about not getting pizza and more *helping pay* for the pizza then getting *shouted* at and insulted for a simple mistake. On top of being completely alone at a new job and generally having a miserable time.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t just crying over not getting a slice of pizza, it was crying after a culmination of many different events. This was just the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.", "Ah, I hadn't seen those comments, yes you're clearly right."]}
