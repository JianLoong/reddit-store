It\u2019s a lot of money to spend without talking it over with you. Plus it can be a big responsibility for some. You need somewhere to keep it, maintenance, etc. I have heard that the 2 happiest days of a boat owners life are the day they buy a boat and the day they sell it. Try to look forward to the day you get to join in the celebration of selling it", "NTA. Purchases this large need to be discussed in advance. Unless your husband is a literal billionaire, this large of a purchase affects you too and should only be done with your consent.", "Providing that you came at this rationally and tried to point out your valid concerns about his spending then you are definitely NTA.\n\n$25K is a LOT of money.  Yes, he may earn more, but I always thought the understanding was a marriage is a partnership.  Large purchases should be discussed.  Reckless spending without consideration of consequences can have devastating effects.  What if he were to become injured and couldn't continue to do a physical job?  Does he have a fallback skillset?  Could you continue to support your household on only one income?\n\nAccidents and other unfortunate occurrences are never planned.  While yes, it is his bonus, and yes he may contribute equally in the home duties, it is also yours and your children's futures he's gambling with by spending before thinking.", "NTA but neither is he.  My wife (40F) and I (42M) have been married for 15 years.  I have worked 2 jobs for the last 20 years.  She's worked the same job as a social worker.  She works 37.5 hours a week.  I work 40 (4\u00d710) year round and a seasonal self employed job 20 to 30 hours a week 8 months a year.  We split the bills 60/40 with me paying more.  I also pay tuition for our children to attend private school at her request but I'm supportive of it.  I would also be fine with public education, we live in a good district, part of the reason we bought a house here.  I did the exact same thing as your husband and bought a used fishing boat for 15k which I worked very hard to earn.  Ive been fishing from a kayak for 20 years.  She wasn't very supportive of my decision.  The boat was purchased from a customer of mine of many years.  He recently got ill and can't go boating or fishing.  His advice to me was do the things you love while you can because tomorrow isn't guaranteed.   I took that to heart and bought the boat.  We are still financially stable and she's come around to the new/used boat.  If it's something he loves and you love him, forgive him and move on.", "NTA. Just because he makes more money doesn\u2019t mean he can make $25k purchases without consulting you.", "NAH. The question of how to categorise \"bonus\" earnings has come up here before. It ultimately comes down to whatever you two agree is fair.  He may not have felt a need to ask for the green light on getting the boat because he sees his bonus as his own money earned for his hard work, separate from his basic earnings which are for joint uses (not saying he's right or wrong, just a perspective).\n\nFrom your comments, it sounds less like your husband has a spending problem and more like you're concerned about having a nest egg for if he can't work any more/loses his job (another subjective discussion). At the same time you seem to indicate that your home is paid off because of your husband, the majority of your savings are in place because of your husband, and he continues to contribute to that by working overtime. \n\nI think large purchases should be agreed upon, but in your case it doesn't sound like you can't afford it (or at least you haven't laid out how), and a person who works like he does and contributes like he does is going to become very resentful if you tell him he's not allowed to invest in his hobby when he can afford it.", "NTA\n\nI'd never dream of making a huge purchase like that without first talking to my spouse.", "NAH, he should have said something but it\u2019s not like you\u2019re hurting for money. He saw a great deal and went for it. It\u2019s an annoying guy thing, but his love of fishing takes over sometimes. Since it didn\u2019t affect your finances, let him know you\u2019re annoyed, and move on. If this is the worst thing he does, you\u2019ll have a great life.", "INFO - You're an RN making only $65k? Why? You know there are better opportunities for you, right? Also, do you guys have a shared bank account? Would he want you to consult him before buying a car? Probably so, so why is he being a jerk off and saying \"my bonus blah blah\".", "NTA. I earn three times more than my wife, and I still consult her over more or less any one off purchase over 100. It\u2019s a respect thing as much as anything else, the same proportion of your income would be $11,000, ask him how he would feel if you dropped $11k on something for you without discussing it.", "And 25k for a boat is super cheap. A good bass boat is 70k+ all day everyday.", "30k for a boat really isn\u2019t that much. He could have easily dropped 75-100k depending on the type of boat, motor/s, accessories, etc.", "YTA \n\nI dont get it. If hes doing the housework, and makes double the money. I actualyl think he should keep whatever extra money hes making. Which would not just be his 30k bonus but the 85k gap. \n\nOf course, if you do 60/40 on the housework then maybe he contributes an extra 10k or whatnot.", "[deleted]", "YTA\n\nBased on what you're saying he is more than pulling his weight in the relationship not only financially but also as far as household tasks go. I don't see why he shouldn't be able to spend his money on something he wants.", "NTA. If you were to go buy something worth the same amount without discussing it with him, how would he feel?\n\nI grew up with a dad like him, he'd show up with cars or campers, etc. And there'd be a huge fight. Sometimes my mom would move out for a few months. I asked my mom why she didn't just leave and she cried and said it's because she loved him, even if he made her miserable. But to me, that's not love. Not even talking it over with your partner is really messed up, it shows that they don't value the opinion or insight of the other person. They're only thinking about themselves. It creates a terrible environment for communication and trust, let alone love.", "NTA.\n\nAs someone who\u2019s been both the bigger and lesser breadwinner, the idea that because one person makes more they get to make big financial decisions unilaterally is a pretty fucked-up\u2014and convenient, for him\u2014view of equality in a marriage. \n\nI never thought more or less of either of us based on $. Or that it gave someone > decision-making power. \u2018To be fair\u2019\u2026is it really \u2018his\u2019 money? Or *our* money?\n\nMaybe you\u2019re different. For me, I\u2019d never be OK w/a spouse who saw (and treated me like) less than a full and equal partner.", "NTA you\u2019re justified to feel that way", "The man wants to fish, if you as a couple can\u2019t have hobbies it\u2019s only going to create animosity in your relationship and nothing good will come from that.  I suggest find your own hobby and you\u2019ll be much happier in your relationship", "Let a mf live it\u2019s not like you paid for it", "Did you work the hours to get the bonus? No.? Then shy of him not telling you at all... then it's his to do what he pleases.", "As an HVAC tech I just want to know where tf he works", "Let the man have his boat, sounds like he has earned it and your family can afford it. I agree though, he probably should have at least mentioned it before buying. Maybe you could have picked a boat together.", "So I haven\u2019t really seen too many comments in favor of husband on this topic. Honestly I don\u2019t take this hard ladies but sometimes y\u2019all need to be grateful. This guy makes about 150k a year while his wife is bringing in 65k in her favor. He takes on his fair share in household duties and still people Are calling for his head. Let him go. Tell her she deserves better all you want but truly he does. If we want to talk about equal he is on the losing end", "YTA.  I've gathered from your replies you guys do a completely joint bank account rather than mine/yours/ours, but I would make a separation between your consistent financial plan vs his bonus.  You guys bring in $215k a year before his bonuses and one of your comments said you have over $130k in savings (too much to keep in savings, invest that).  Yeah it's a lot of money, but it's play money.  Would it be more responsible to put that towards some REITs or buy a rental property?  Sure it would, but since it's extra it's not particularly irresponsible to use it for fun, let him have his fun.\n\nThat's the finance part, here's the emotional part.  I'm guessing that your issue it at least as much, if not more, the fact he didn't consult you first.  Yes, it would have been more respectful for him to do that.  At the same time, you indicate how you've conditioned him to not be able to do that.  You said you've talked to him before about buying cheaper fishing gear... How would you have responded to him letting you know he was going to buy a $25k boat?  It's likely you would have tried to talk to him again about not spending so much on the passion that he loves.  He already knew how you would respond, it would not be the supportive response he wants, so why ask?\n\nThis is exactly the type of emotional situations that the Yours/Mine/Ours method prevents.  You set the \"Ours\" together however it works for you two, but includes the money set aside for investing and the future.  Then with the Yours/Mine, individuals can spend as much money as the want, however they want, and not make the other uncomfortable because the Ours is already taken care of.", "YTA \n\nHis hard work earned him that boat.", "That's cheap money for a boat you should be thankful", "$25K for a boat is nothing, could have spent over $100K so it\u2019s not an issue.", "ESH - this should be a couples conversation. But if he's working a ton of extra hours and making half the money, I fully understand the feeling that he's \"earned\" that boat. And if you're the \"practical/no\" partner, then it's easy to see why he doesn't ask", "Just by reading the title, NTA", "> I fear that my insistence on financial responsibility might be making him feel restricted, and that's something I need to consider.\n\nNAH. It sounds like you and he have different definitions of financial responsibility, and you are pressuring him to convert to your definition. Decide how willing you are to die on this hill, because it sounds like he\u2019s unwilling to change based on your frustration alone. Can you show in concrete financial terms that his spending is negatively impacting your collective ability to meet your long-term saving goals? Do you regularly connect with each other on how you manage your collective finances as a married couple? If not, then you have some work to do together that is bigger than a boat.", "I wonder if all the \u201cNTAs\u201d feel the same in a role reversal?", "NTA. Financial decisions like that should be discussed unless you're billionaires and $25,000 is pennies to you or something. \n\nPlus, his attitude towards his bonus shows a definite lack of responsibility. The bonus isn't just a fun extra that you can throw away - you could have used at least some of it for savings.", "NTA - and I gave it a lot of thought to come up with this conclusion. Reading into this post without your husband's side it sounds like you are saying he has a spending problem and his thought on money is treat himself and live it up. So its not a one off large purchase. I always feel no matter what when making a large purchase a spouse should always tell their spouse. At least give a heads up. \n\nWith a joint bank account its not just his money or your money separately. \n\nI do recommend both of you going together to a financial advisor just to get a good idea how much should be put in savings per year or per month. Also to talk and ask advise on what major financial decisions you both are planning to make in the future such as if you plan to start a family.", "Fishing with a boat is awesome.  Be glad he didn't put 25k down on a much bigger boat.", "NAH. It\u2019s his bonus for his work. Not joint money.

Also I dont find it all that far-fetched of an idea to consider a bonus splurge money", "NTA Your husband doesn't see you as a team. In his mind you're individuals sharing bills  & a bed.

I personally see marriage as a complete union where everything is brought into the marriage and owned jointly. It is a total sharing of life between each other. So, to act like one\u2019s wants or desires matters more because they earn more or do some type of work that they think is more important is insane to me. Financial decisions are joint decisions out of mutual respect, admiration, and partnership. \n\nBut again, it\u2019s Reddit. Someone else will tell you that you are an entitled AH for wishing your husband didn\u2019t drop $25k without discussing it with you because he makes more than you and works hard. \n\nNTA to me, according to my personal belief about marriage.

It\u2019s not coming out of his base pay so the additional amount wouldn\u2019t have been budgeted for regardless.

I agree it should be discussed for big purchases, but I have seen couples that had the; my money is mine, your money is yours arrangement.

When you hear that UH would bring down the cost of healthcare, where to you think the savings come from? You're basically taking the capitalist system out of the industry so one-payer can drive the cost down, including the salary of the people working in that industry. It's the same reason why doctors all over the world drool about going to the U.S. to practice, even with the burden of getting recertified.\n\nI'm not arguing for or against UH but just wanted to point out the correlation.

You all have a paid off house he provided, he does a lot and it sounds like he doesn't do this type of thing all the time. Just let it go. He didn't put you all in a bad spot by doing it and it seems like you all have saved and done really well.

I know CAD is weak, so converting your 65k salary is around 47k, your husbands is 110k USD. 18k USD for a boat is ALOT of money, he definitely should have consulted you first.

I hadn't thought of that, so thank you for sharing that information. I think in order for UH to succeed in a place like Canada (or the US) we'd both need lower cost of living. making 65k Canadian $ is not enough for OP to buy a house where she's at, with the help of her husband yes, but I'd assume majority of citizens make 100k CAN on a dual income household.", "You should not have shared bank accounts if he is going to pull stuff like that, at least most of your money shouldn't be in there.  \nAlso nurses I know make 2 or 3 times that much so maybe after you have a few years experience look around for a better job.", "By the OP's own admission he is contributing more money to the household, is working twice as hard, and is still taking on his share of the household chores.
