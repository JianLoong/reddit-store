We currently live in a college dorm (shared one bedroom) and we\u2019re randomly assigned (have only known her for a little under 6 weeks). My roommates boyfriend lives across the country (US) and I have only met him in passing one other time. Last night he flew in at midnight and they got back to the room not too long after. They were talking with each other which in my opinion is not a big deal. Around 1ish I heard him ask if I was asleep and she said she didn\u2019t know. He then told her to be quiet and well there was a gasp (edit: this part does sound dramatic but wanted to give enough details for people to get the point). At this point I was having an anxiety attack (edit: not due to them having sex but more feeling trapped in the situation) and grabbed my keys and drove home (about an hour).\n\nThis morning she texted asking where I was and I told her I drove home and I\u2019m not ok with him sleeping over so he either needs to find a place or I need some gas money to commute from home. She texted back asking if we could talk about it or give more strict rules. That it was \u2018not sex\u2019 and he was \u2018feeling on me like a more intense cuddle.\u2019 Then offered the strict rules of no staying up talking (not a big deal to me), no kissing, and no feeling up while I\u2019m in the room. \n\nThey do tend to lean more traditional and I\u2019m thinking the definition of sex used in her text is penetration. I feel like feeling up while someone is in the room to the point of being told not to make to much noise and gasping is part of sex. My back was turned towards them so I didn\u2019t see anything but wtf is an \u2018intense cuddle?\u2019 Foreplay? That\u2019s part of sex. \n\nWIBTA For saying he needs to find somewhere else to stay or they need to give me some gas money?\n\nEdit: I gave them a schedule of when I\u2019m not going to be in the room and will be out for most of the weekend. I feel like the \u201cintense cuddle\u201d is just semantics.\n\nUpdate: I told her the gas money was a little extreme and that I was feeling uncomfortable with the situation and a tad disrespected. She apologized over text and we plan to have a conversation after he leaves at some point next week. She then offered me gas money. Also the part about the gas money was more me feeling that I shouldn't have to pay (literally) because I am uncomfortable with the situation. I haven't responded to that text yet. I am not part of a religious school or any religion. Honestly was raised and still am very sex positive. Everyone should be having sex and with whoever they want (within legal and moral definitions).

The difference is before she (a friend of mine) crawled into bed next to us, I very clearly said \"You may want to find another room, we're going to have sex in a bit.\", her response was just \"Ok, cool, try not to get any cum on me, or at least not in my hair, I'm going to sleep but might watch if you wake me up.\".\n\nConsent was the difference, she had no issue being there and my girlfriend and I didn't mind either.  If anyone did have any issue, something would have had to change.  Similar things with roommates and people having sex in the living room (and I've walked in on it getting home), we all had an agreement about it (no one cared, just wipe things after), but everyone was consulted on it prior.\n\nClearly I'm not a prude, this isn't about any \"generational thing\" or \"growing up\", or even religion, it's about people being forced to be in the presence of others fucking when they don't want to be.", "\u201cVictim\u201d lmao sex in the same dorm room is a form of assault now?

He needs to leave.", "NTA. You are with a random roommate who has now brought another person you know even less. Most college dorms don't allow outside visitors to stay overnight.

Yuck and borderline should be some sort of sexual harassment.  We hung out outside of their room almost exclusively and I was only in there briefly, like half an hour or a couple of hours to watch a movie at most, then I'd leave.  \n\nYou all have completely lost perspective on respecting each others rights as roommates.", "NTA....I wouldn't particularly mind but they'd have to agree that if they're gonna bone in the room with me I get to record. I bet that would end that.", "Oh my god you were all in the SAME ROOM? NTA they should not be subjecting you to their sexual activity without explicit consent", "No but you're wrong for not standing your ground.

You shouldn't have to leave your room for them.", "Having sex in the same room as a sleeping roommate is a right of passage in college.

Also you could have spoken up in the immediate moment...something like \"YES I AM AWAKE\". \n\nHOWEVER...it is concerning that your first move was to say nothing, you second was to run and your third was dropping an ultimatum that he needs to go somewhere else or she needs to give you gas money. I mean gas money? WTF?\n\nThere's compromise potential here. I dunno about your schedule, it sounds a little sketchy/controlling but maybe it's not. But she lives there, too, and unless your dorm has rules against overnight visitors, you'll need to work this out.\n\nYour uniformed thoughts on whether or not your randomly-assigned roommate whom you don't yet know is \"traditional\" or what she and he considers sex, is irrelevant, as is your laughable \"semantics\" thought. You don't actually know what they were doing. But you do need to talk, like ASAP.", "NTA. Neither are they. Your roommate seems very respectful and sorry for making you feel uncomfortable. \n\nEh. NTA all round.", "NTA, but driving one hour away home in the middle of the night is quite intense.  If you felt uncomfortable, you could have just told them not to do stuff when you're there instead of making a scene.  Anyway, I don't think it's fair he can't come to your dorm to visit your roommate, unless they continue that kind of behaviour while you're there.", "NTA. Furthermore, this is a firm \"no means no\" type of situation; if the roommate or her partner tries to convince, or Heaven forbid pressure you to change your mind, you should go straight to the RA, because you are 9001% in the right to refuse this situation.\n\nAlso, it's cute that this post is labeled NSFW, or maybe I'm just old and battle-worn.", "NTA! Ages ago, I had two roommates my freshman year and they would both bring guys back and it was\u2026not good. Your roomie needs to be considerate of the fact that your space is shared and not just hers!", "NTA  I think it's incredibly disrespectful and disgusting to perform any type of sexual act in the same room as other people.  From experience it is so uncomfortable and gross.  Are you able to get a different roommate?\n\nEdit:  I do think that saying everyone should be having sex is wrong.  Not everyone is comfortable with other people.  I can't imagine being okay with a man touching me let alone taking advantage of me.  I've never understood why woman willingly have sex it's so painful and terrifying.  I've always believed it's only enjoyable for men unless you into pain and humiliation.", "NTA - you are being sexually harassed. Many years ago I had a roommate that did this to me and I was too much a wimp to make a stink about it. You don\u2019t consent to having a strange man sleep in your bedroom and have sex (cuddling my a$$) in the bed next to you. Tell your roommate he doesn\u2019t get to spend the night ever again.

Get an apartment already", "I also don't think shes TA honestly its been really great we plan on having a sit down at some point next week", "Its a shared room. If its in the same house I couldn't care less, it was more feeling trapped in an awkward situation and not knowing what to do in it since I haven't run into this with other roommates.", "Also, its uncommon for people in the US to share a dorm room after freshman year. That these two are 20 and 21 in a single dorm room is unusual", "I still don't feel as though foreplay is something that should be happening with me in the room. Honestly not \"overprotected\" in the least bit and am very sex positive. Foreplay is sexual activity before intercourse (for a cishet couple). Emphasis on the sexual activity part", "I never had foreplay with my roommate in the bed next to me in college ever. Weird take telling OP that she's over protected because she doesn't want to hear her roommate get finger banged.", "I am going to be out for a lot of the weekend and extended my hours out during the week so I didn't think it would be a big deal. When I brought up the ultimatum, she mentioned them sleeping in a car which made me feel bad, so I decided to just commute (I told her that the gas money was extreme, and I was just upset when I typed that) and plan to have a conversation next week when he leaves.", "Yeah... no. I'm 40 years old and never had sex with my roommate in the bed next to me. What a weird take.", "My schedule was basically I would be in the room at some point between 7-9ish for bed until Friday and then regular time for the time I get up. Home for the weekend. This was fully changeable should she have asked for extra times on xyz day but seemed reasonable on everyone's part. I know that their relationship values outside of sex are traditional and by traditional in this sense meant cishet ideas of what 'sex' is. The semantics comment is more based off the Bill Clinton Monica Lewinsky did he or didn't he based on your definition and does fit in this case.", "I wasn't trying to make a scene just get out of there asap sorta thing.

You are doing a great job of communicating with them. It sounds like your roommate is really excellent too. I hope you talk it all over and stay tight despite this hiccup.", "You gave a schedule of when you're not in the room but also said you planned to return early without telling her, which is a dick move. Which is it?", "This isn\u2019t like they live in a house. They live in a single room dorm. A woman asking that a man she does not know leave before she goes to sleep is not at all unreasonable.", "It is a shared room, obviously.", "It is a shared room and my anxiety was more feeling trapped in the situation", "What if said person having the attack had a history of being SA'd?  That's not the case here but to say someone is childish is sort of ignorant.

No it\u2019s not \u201ctraumatizing\u201d just awkward. Then I got my own gf and did the same thing. I tried to mostly do it when my roommate was gone but hey night time sleeping in the same bed as your gf you tend to get excited\u2026 it\u2019s fuckin normal.

If a young man, didn\u2019t want a woman to spend the night in his room, he has a right to not consent to that. But you\u2019re acting like this is her just trying to be a block to intimacy. What it really is is a firm boundary that she has a right to have. And if it were a man, I would be saying the exact same thing.\n\nBut to act like this is just some childish nonsense that doesn\u2019t have a legitimate reason is ludicrous. You brought up gender, which is why I said women have a legitimate reason to be fearful of men. Men have a legitimate reason to be scared of other men. And, there are some crazy ladies out there; so if men want to be trepidatious, I understand completely. \n\nI was stating that a woman doesn\u2019t want to be defenseless in sleep while a man she does not know is in the room with her. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t feel safe with someone in your home, you (as a man/woman/anything) have a right to ask them to leave ."]}
