Couples have sex or do things\u2026 it\u2019s clear you do not want him to stay over or hear them doing stuff. Just talk to your friend and make sure she understands you don\u2019t like it so y\u2019all can work around it.", "NTA. You don't need to be comfortable with this and I don't think you need to compromise. Also, you shouldn't have to be in the same room with another couple having sex since you're not consenting to that. \n\nHer boyfriend needs to get out and get a hotel. You should not have to drive home because of this. Or tell your RA and ask how they can help you.", "NTA Are overnight guests even allowed in shared rooms at your campus? That would be very uncommon as far as I know. Also, even if it was allowed you should be able to feel comfortable in the place you sleep in.

You aren\u2019t the first person to deal with this situation. It\u2019s actually completely normal.

You're in college and I imagine you're saving a substantial amount of money by sharing a room. I think you need to understand that saving money by sharing comes with sacrifices which includes forgoing a certain amount of privacy. You and your roommate have needs just like the rest of us, and at some point those needs may inconvenience you. If you really can't cope with a simple gasp then maybe you would be better off stumping up the extra cash and finding a place to yourself.", "YWBTA - You need to be a little less reactive and show a little more maturity now that you are in college and share space with others. You literally ran home because you didn\u2019t know how to openly deal with this issue. Nix the gas money and say he needs to find someplace else to stay overnight. You shouldn\u2019t have to hear them dry humping because they can\u2019t ask you to be scarce for 2 hours during the day.", "YTA. Couples have sex. . Especially after not seeing each other for a long time.

Like others have said you aren\u2019t required to put up with their antics. But consider you live with them and will make life easier if you work with your roommate. Maybe give them some alone time so they don\u2019t have to try and be sneaky. I was in a similar situation and found my own anxiety just made things problematic at first. My solution was to spend the night at a friends or just go watch a movie in the common rooms a little late when my friend would have company over. Was I tired the next day? Sure but I have a happy roommate who I am still friends w to this day. You both share this place and you should both act like it", "NTA", "Totally agree. I\u2019m going home for most of the weekend and he also decided to come early without letting her know in advance. I gave them a schedule and extended the hours I\u2019m out of the room.", "Agreed, communication and compromise for both you and your roommate will probably be the best route and is also helpful for any roommate situation. Also \u201cintense cuddling\u201d got me giggling NAH", "Right and I\u2019m ok with them doing things and even gave a schedule of when I wouldn\u2019t be in the room and extended the hours I\u2019m not in.

I gave them a schedule and won\u2019t be home for most of the weekend so I felt disrespected and like the intense cuddle is just semantics.", "Does intense cuddling make noise ?", "You\u2019re wrong. This is a *college dorm*, not an apartment or house. Two people sleeping/living in the same room is very different than a home with separate private spaces. Colleges usually have extremely specific rules regarding overnight guests. Some schools allow overnight visitors with the explicit consent of both roommates, and they limit the number of nights per month guests are allowed. Other schools don\u2019t allow any overnight visitors at all. OP didn\u2019t state the school, so it\u2019s impossible to know the exact rules. But I\u2019d be willing to bet anything that OP\u2019s roommate is \u201clegally allowed\u201d to have her boyfriend stay the night in their dorm without OP\u2019s consent.", "you\u2019re gross for that, just because you are happy to violate other people\u2019s boundaries doesn\u2019t mean this is acceptable behaviour", "Was I supposed to interrupt them? I went home so I could sleep before class today. How should I deal with it at 1am while they\u2019re doing their thing?", "lol don't be daft. It is incredibly violating to do what they did when OP was lying in her bed in the same room. \n\nThis post isn't \"are college-age couples allowed to have sex?\" jfc dude have some common sense.", "People get stupid when love/sex are involved. I had a similar situation in college where my roommate's gf basically moved into our room and they were at it like rabbits all day. Devolved into a really bad situation because I didn't nip it in the bud. \n\nIs this a one-off visit, or is this expected to be a regular thing? If it's a one-off, you are probably best off giving them some space for the weekend and having a serious conversation with your roommate about boundaries after he leaves. If there's even a hint that this might be a regular thing, you have to shut it down immediately and set strict rules. It wouldn't be unreasonable for a young woman to not feel safe with a man she doesn't know suddenly moving into her living space.", "Oh then you should be fine just reminding her. She should be mindful that because you are \u201casleep\u201d doesn\u2019t mean sexy time. Hopefully it works out.", "I can't speak for all universities, but at mine, overnight guests were a typical thing. It really just depended on the RA and whether or not they cared. I agree that everyone should feel comfortable where they sleep, but making that a reality while sharing a space with someone else means compromises need to be made.", "If you're doing it right!", "didn\u2019t catch that thanks for letting me know! must\u2019ve skipped over it bc for some reason i thought they were in an apartment.\n\nmy point does still stand that i think it\u2019s not up to OP to decide whether her roommate has guests because they\u2019re basically living there on equal footing", "Yes, you were! \u201cI\u2019m trying to sleep in here. Can you not have sex or be quieter?\u201d Or you could have taken your blanket and pillow to the dorm\u2019s common area and gone to sleep. Driving an hour home was overkill. You lost 2 hours driving home.\n\nI had that happen to me in college too and I woke up, took my stuff and crashed in a friend\u2019s dorm room because she had a futon. Then the next day I had a real conversation with my roommate and it never happened again.", "go to sleep like normal people? its a dorm shit happens lol", "Do you know I had friends who had to sleep through sex going on in shared bunk beds?!!! That\u2019s why you communicate rules and a system. Otherwise you get a dorm room by yourself or move into an off-campus apartment."]}
