Frankly I'm impressed that you're still talking to these people.  If it were me, I would ghost this person and not lose any sleep over it.", "NTA.\n\nThey didn\u2019t ask for your availability and don\u2019t work with your schedule. It\u2019s not even YOUR child, it\u2019s your niece. I literally saw my aunt and uncle once or less per year as a child.", "NTA-They want you to ooh, ahh and fawn over their children without putting in the time or effort to be a real family with you. Basically, you and your wife are props to them to be used and discarded at their pleasure.", "NTA. That's quite the list your SIL is keeping... honestly, I've never understood the \"you're missing key milestones\" argument. The only person who remembers you not being there is your SIL. I'd start feeling bad when the kids can actually remember if you were in attendance or not.", "Your in-laws are exhausting. \nNTA", "NTA - If they are unwilling to go to you because \"you're too far,\" why is it wrong for you and not them?", "NTA and I had to laugh at \u201cher kids hardly ask about us because they don\u2019t see us.\u201d No, they don\u2019t ask BECAUSE THEY ARE BABIES.", "NTA.  They want you to come to them on their terms and are being jerks when you don't.  That's not how relationships work. \n\nAs an aside: I'm going to take a guess here, and say you and your wife don't currently have kids?  Could be totally wrong, but maybe they expect you to put in more effort since it's \"easier\" - they just give that vibe from my reading.  Regardless (assuming you want to see these people more often), they need a talking to about a) accepting that you have constraints and taking the involvement you can offer, and b) putting in more effort of their own.", "NTA. The world does not revolve around her children. The fact that you aren't putting them first in your plans doesn't mean you don't care. It means they are not your entire life, and there's no reason they should be. She can't see that because her life does revolve around them. She may need a hobby that doesn't center her kids.", "NTA - kids do not remember their 1st and 2nd birthday, and do not care who was there or not. your SIL is delusional, self-centered, and outrageously entitled. don\u2019t let her get you stressed. you\u2019re not doing anything wrong.", "One year olds can\u2019t remember anyway. NTA.", "NTA. They seem to think the whole world should revolve around their kid. Consider low contact.", "NTA. SIL sounds completely narcissistic.", "NTA. She really holds a grudge.", "NTA. This is nutty.  If they won\u2019t visit you because it\u2019s too far, and won\u2019t ask when you\u2019re available, it\u2019s their own fault you\u2019re missing things. Some people just can\u2019t be reasoned with and for some dumb reason think everyone should prioritize their kids with no thought to the fact that we all have our own lives. This is definitely a \u201cthem\u201d thing,  not a \u201cyou\u201d thing.", "NTA - An invitation to an event is not a summons to appear.", "NTA - you have your own life. This tends to happen as families grown and there are marriages/new kids - some people always wind up thinking their nuclear family is the center of the universe.", "NTA", "NTA, parents need to remember their kids are not as important to other people as they are to them. I can't stand people with so much self importance.", "NTA my husband and I have never been to a single birthday for any of our nieces and nephews. Most of his family is in Nova Scotia and we are in Alberta. We see his family every few years. The kids know we love them. We make sure to do fun things with just the kids when we go out there. My husbands siblings have never expected us to show up for a birthday. Your SIL sounds like a bitter pill.", "NTA. They can't control your plans. If you're not available, you aren't.

Set some firm boundaries and consequences with this type of unreasonable manipulation now before it escalates to even more craziness.", "NTA. They sound unreasonable, don\u2019t reciprocate, and the babies will not know or care if you\u2019re there.", "NTA. She thinks the world revolves around her and her kids. It does not. Live your life and don\u2019t worry about her issues.", "NTA: not sure why your SIL expects your lives to revolve around their children?! I mean there was a pandemic in there- does SIL expect you to stop covid to get to her kids party as well?!", "NTA - The child is one. They won\u2019t even remember who was or wasn\u2019t there. At that age, it\u2019s a family gathering, not even a real kid\u2019s birthday party. So they can get over it if you two weren\u2019t available because of, well, not being anywhere near them at the time of the event.", "NTA, the main character syndrome going on here is hysterical. Just because her world revolves around her kids, doesn't mean the rest of the world does", "NTA. What a narcissist! Her children aren\u2019t the center of everyone\u2019s universe. Why is she so obsessed with you and your wife??", "NTA.  I cannot *imagine* thinking someone would be an AH for missing a *first* birthday party, except for the parents.  At that age, the party is not for the kid, the kid won't remember it.\n\nDisclosure: I'm six uncles.  I think I've attended two first birthdays.  (But, one niece and one nephew on my spouse's side were alive before we got married, so those may not \"count\".)", "NTA. I have 4 kids, both my siblings are child free. My oldest is 17, my youngest is 4. So there's been quite a few birthday parties over the years. And my siblings have only been to a small handful of them. It's just not a big deal. My husband's child free sibling has been to every single party, but I promise you that none of the kids has ever looked at the photos and questioned why one uncle was there and not the other, etc.", "NTA  Your wife has nothing to feel bad about. She is doing the right thing focusing on her own family even if that only consists of you and her. You have the opportunity to visit your father and you have to take the opportunity when you can. That is where her focus should be. I am assuming from the way I read your post that while you were spending the week with your in-laws that SIL didn't make much effort to see either of you, focusing on her family. Just as it should be, each has main focus on own family. Wife should be happy, she's doing the right thing.  Hug the woman for standing by you instead of kowtowing to SIL.", "NTA. For my kids birthday parties, I ALWAYS get in touch with out of state relatives to see if or when they might be visiting here, or when they are available to come for a birthday party(we only do 1 for both kids and it falls right between their actual birthdays). \n\nIf she actually wanted you guys there then she would stop being a stuck up snob, stop being so self involved and ask for your availability ahead of time.", "I genuinely love the rest of her family and they are of the mindset to \u201ckeep the peace\u201d so I\u2019ve got to bite my tongue a bit. We are the only ones that don\u2019t live within a 10-15 minute drive and these are people that have never left their small town and don\u2019t understand the logistics of balancing time between extended families.", "That\u2019s what I said to my wife who was really emotional about this. A lot of parents aren\u2019t present for their own kids and we are expected to never miss a single event for her niece/nephew when she\u2019s never even been close with that sibling.", " My response was \u201cyour kid isn\u2019t going to remember their first birthday party, however, my aging parents will remember me not being around\u201d. \n\nApparently that didn\u2019t resonate but they also live 5 minutes away WALKING from my in laws and couldn\u2019t be bothered to go spend time with them after my FIL had open heart surgery last month. We drove the 2 hours and spent the week there with her mom. I think they\u2019re just resentful that we actually do make an effort.", "You got it 100%. We are childless so it\u2019s feeling like our time is seen as less than.", "Yes, thank you. Posted this for my wife who was feeling guilty. We both try to see both sides of every situation but I also found this just plain \u201cnutty\u201d", "Yes, this! I grew up in Ontario and had family in BC which I saw maybe 3 times total as a kid but never thought of them as any less than the rest of my family. The whole thing just seems ridiculous to me. \n\nHer family all lives within 10-15 minutes of each other so I don\u2019t know if they just don\u2019t understand logistics of having to balance other obligations or if they really just are that self-centred. Maybe a combination of both.", "These people didn\u2019t change anything about their lives due to covid.", "Next time tell them you live \u201ctoo far.\u201d Copy and paste a message they sent with that lmao", "Super frustrating! I have a little one, so i know how much life changes, but you can't expect everyone to cater to you.\n\nI doubt they will change their behavior much if you call them out, but maybe it will make you feel better if you address their attitude?  (Or, you know, just text \"stay mad bro\" and move on)", "They are really just that selfish. When we go out east it\u2019s usually for a two week minimum. It\u2019s a long way to go so we make it a longer visit. SIL wants you and your wife to bend over backwards and be at her beck and call for what she deems important. She doesn\u2019t extend the same effort in return. I don\u2019t think my husband and I are in a single Christmas or Easter picture with his family. No one asks why we aren\u2019t as far as I know.", "Ah\u2026 they seem like the types. \n\nClearly you should have somehow found a way to get into the country to meet your nephew. Parachute in perhaps?? /s", "Yeah, and my wife should have been alone on her birthday for a second year in a row so that she could attend a one year old\u2019s party. Lol we literally hadn\u2019t seen each other in months and she thinks the party should have been the priority. Insane.", "NTA. A kid's first birthday doesn't even matter to the kid, it's all about the parents. People who make a huge deal out of it are generally being selfish.", "NTA", "NTA but you may consider sending her a version of this post (or your wife should if it\u2019s her sister). As a parent it can be hurtful when people don\u2019t have the relationship with your kids that you hoped for, and in the craziness of parenting toddlers it can be hard to see that other people have lots of other commitments too. If she saw that you had genuine reasons not to be at things, and saw how she was contributing to the situation by not visiting or inviting you more often, it might help.", "People with kids expect you to shuffle due to their choices. Some people are game because they\u2019re close to their family but evidently, you\u2019re not (or else you\u2019d have put more effort in, or they would\u2019ve) so NTA.", "NTA. And I highly doubt the kids will ask why you weren\u2019t at an event they can\u2019t remember when they\u2019ll be grown."]}
