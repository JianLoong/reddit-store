But I always warn people if they're driving me, mostly that I might not be the best conversation partner because I'm going to pop dramamine which may knock me out", "If you know you get car sick, it is your responsibility to plan ahead as much as possible to avert it (i.e. certain snacks as you mentioned or proper medication). I think Jane was just being a pain in the ass, and I don't blame Op's irritation - just don't agree with threatening to leave behind.

Win win.", "It was an 8 hour car ride for Jane... based off the times in the ops post i would say that he picked her up mid afternoon 2-4pm, as he commented he didnt want to get there at 2am (2am - 8hour car ride =~~4pm~~ 6pm) at this point she should have already eaten breakfast and lunch maybe even an early dinner so 2 meals and 4 snack breaks is a little excessive for this time of day. if they had been traveling from 8 am to 4 pm the need for more meals would exist (even then i'd eat bfast before i left and dinner when I get there) but that doesnt seem like it is the case here\n\nEdited to correct car ride math", "It's only 8 hours for Jane. 12 hours for OP. If Jane had eaten before she left she'd need only one meal, as OP had planned (assuming she brought snacks too).", "But in back to back hours?", "I find it's the darned signs that say \"58 miles to next restroom/exit\" that make me want to go.

We went to Ft Vancouver at my daughter's request yesterday for the Pokemon GO Fest taking place this weekend and even though we're minutes away, my husband packed a cooler with water, snacks and extra sunblock.  Speaking of which, maybe I should just bring a blanket to sit on in the shade today.  A long car ride would DEFINITELY have snacks packed though.  LOTS of snacks.", "Newborn eggshells", "As long as she buys any extra bus tickets that works for me.  But it\u2019d be worth it for OP to buy the first", "2am - 8 hours is 6pm.", "already corrected but that only makes my point stronger she could have eaten all 3 meals before she even hit the road."]}
