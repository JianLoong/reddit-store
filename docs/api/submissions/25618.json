So we stopped. \n\nHour 2 of the journey she requested my girlfriend turned the music COMPLETELY off as she \u2018didn\u2019t like music\u2019?? \n\nHour 3 of the journey Jane wanted to stop for some food, I asked her to hold on an hour as I had already planned where we were stopping and getting gas and I wanted to limit stops. Jane then spent the next hour complaining of \u2018feeling sick and faint\u2019. \n\nHour 4, we stopped and Jane disappeared for half an hour and when my girlfriend found her she was just sat outside on FaceTime one of her friends. \n\nHour 5, we stopped because Jane needed to use the restroom. At which point Jane purchased another meal. \n\nHour 6, I pulled over so Jane could sit shotgun as she was \u2018getting car sick\u2019. At which point she wanted to debate why marriage is archaic and exists to limit women. \n\nHour 7, stopped for restroom and more snacks at Janes requests. \n\nHour 8, we are on the final stretch to my Moms house and Jane requests to stop again. I say no, we are nearly there. Jane then says that she is going to be sick and we have to stop. I refuse, and say I will pull over if she\u2019s going to actually be sick but we are 30 minutes away. \n\nWhen we arrive at my moms house she announces to my step dad, that I refused to stop the car for her and she\u2019s so ill etc. My mom then shouts at me \u2018because I know Jane is sensitive\u2019. Jane is 29, I am 28 so not children. \n\nSince then all weekend Jane has made reference to it and told my girlfriend that I \u2018can be cruel and nasty and has been since a child\u2019.

Refusing to stop when she \u2018felt sick\u2019 and refusing to drive her home and she now has no transport. \n\n2.
