If the girl is this sensitive and narcissistic there is no way she will go NC with him. She will need something in 2 weeks and come back.", "Why doesn't step dad want to lose contact with super fussy Jane?  More info required please", "They are step siblings", "We used to do seven hour road trips with our kids. Without devices. We would absolutely stop if they asked, hada million snacks and listened to whatever music that kept them happy. they were better passengers than Jane by the age of four.", "I've been taking long road trips since I was only 2-3, I don't even remember acting like that at that age. The *only* time I've ever been a demanding passenger was recently. I had to stop every hour or so for a bathroom break, but that's because I'm pregnant. It also gave me an excuse to walk around for a few minutes since I've figured out that my legs now cramp if I sit for too long. I decided after that trip I won't be taking anymore long distance ones until after my kid is born because it was extremely upsetting for me to feel like I was being demanding (my husband was completely understanding, I was just upset). The step sister has no shame and it's clear OP would be dealing with the same BS on the way back if he gave her another ride. When someone is nice enough to do something for you, especially drive you that far you say thank you, shut up, and don't make a fuss unless it's actually important.", "I knew there must be scripture. ;)", "If pushed, eat a ton of beans the night before.

This is completely the opposite.", "I like imagining her trying to pull this kind of nonsense on a bus.", "And opening up the soda bottles too", "Request that he use his phone to record the entire ride too but don't tell her.", "I\u2019m pretty sure Jane is the stepdad\u2019s daughter, so that would be why he doesn\u2019t want to lose contact with her.", "Exactly! We do have devices but we try to limit them, and pack other activities. Disposable cameras are great! \n\nBut it\u2019s a rookie error on Jane\u2019s part. Who doesn\u2019t pack snacks for a long road trip? If it was just me, I\u2019d pack them for anything longer than 90 minutes, but with the kids, anything longer than 45 mins, and snacks & drinks are essential.", "Oh the long road trips are rough when pregnant. I\u2019m due with my 3rd at the end of October, and if I sit in one spot for too long, my hips seize up & I get cramps in my legs. Don\u2019t even get me started on having to go to the toilet!

AHs in a family get away with it because everybody walks around them as if tippy-toeing over newborn eggshells.

I bet your \"passenger\" is a better one than OP's step sister too.", "I didn't realize how rough it would be! Seriously, I spent the first day after we got to where we were going, just laying down cause everything hurt and I was exhausted. The rest of the trip was okayish minus the fact that a lot of the things we did while pregnancy safe weren't that enjoyable when you're having to walk a lot in the blazing heat with sciatica. At one point, I had to go to the gift shop at a zoo just to cool off. They sold fountain drinks there, I bought a cup just for ice to chew/suck on because I was convinced I was going to puke from the heat. I was so frustrated that everything felt 10\u00d7 harder than normal and I didn't have the freedom to enjoy things like I normally do. I did enjoy going to a lot of the local attractions but if I had a do over I wouldn't have taken that trip just because I was in pain, frustrated, or uncomfortable for the majority of it. I understand that even sitting through an event with speeches is difficult. I attended a funeral yesterday. I ended up slipping out the door when someone called for an intermission (first intermission I've ever seen at a funeral). I just couldn't deal with sitting there in the most uncomfortable chairs possible any longer. I paid my respects and was ready to go. Luckily, no one in the family was upset that I decided to ditch. They just called me later to make sure I was okay.", "With a good portion of broccoli ;).", "Ah!!  \ud83d\ude02", "And the award for best shotgun rider goes to......You.
