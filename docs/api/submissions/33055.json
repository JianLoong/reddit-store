Anecdotally, the kindest thing my parents ever did for me was kick me out.   I was 21, not going to school, working at a dead end job to get enough money for weed and video games, and generally not doing anything else.  My parents talked with me both calmly and forcefully multiple times, before they finally hit me with the ultimatum of either paying a ridiculous amount of rent or moving out.  I couldn\u2019t afford their rent so they booted me.   I got an apt with roommates which was fucking miserable.  It took a couple years, but it eventually made me figure out that I either was going to be a loser or get my proverbial crap together. \n\nIt won\u2019t be easy.  Honestly, I bet it will really suck for you - talking with my parents about it years after the fact, I found out my mother cried for weeks after they booted me.  She was terrified for me.  \n\nThere are consequences to actions.  Best the young man learns that in a safe environment.  In other words, not only are you NTA, you\u2019re doing the young man a great kindness.", "NTA.  You had clear expectations \"You\u2019re going to pay rent and you gotta buy your own food, and if for some reason out of your control you can\u2019t get a job or got laid off I\u2019ll work with you on rent and maybe food as long as you bust your ass to find a/another job.

It may be harsh, but you're trying to help him out and he needs to make an effort to at least meet you halfway.

You're obviously willing to cut him some slack and work through things if he's at least trying, but he's not.\n\nMaybe you and your wife need to talk with him about expectations. Helping with rent and food costs seems fair for an adult family member to do when they're living with you; at the *very least* he should help out with food. Myself, I wouldn't fuss about someone in the house sharing if I brought home a bucket of chicken or a pizza, but that's because I'd want to share, not because it's an assumption or expectation that I would.\n\nLong story short, he needs to wake up and take charge, and he needs to know that you're *far* more forgiving about all this than the government would be, for instance.", ">He claims that since he\u2019s family we should let him have our food and he shouldn\u2019t have to pitch.\n\nHow would he feel if he bought his own food and you ate it before he had a chance to, all without paying for it?\n\nHe's should not expect you to be any more generous with him than he is with you. \"But we're family!!

If he wanted to mooch he could do it there. He came to you, the family hard ass with, it seems, the intention to get his adult life started. He admires you and wanted that structure and kick up the ass. \n\nIt sounds like it went ok for a while and then he fell off the wagon so to speak. (Though apparently he can save and budget his money pretty well, that's worth something.) I wonder if his behaviour at the moment is less laziness and more avoidance/anxiety. He's fallen back into old habits because it's a safe space when he feels lost and like he's failing. \n\nHe might need a little less ass-riding and a bit more encouragment and understanding. Maybe, instead of telling him to go fix the car, and getting mad when he avoids it. Spend the quality time and do it with him, teach him how (or learn from him).  Pick a day and make it a bonding experience where he can feel like he achieved something and put something right. Letting him open up about how he feels  and what's holding him back might be the way towards making a plan to get him back on track.\n\nHe's an adult, but he's very young and it doesn't sound like he ever got the tools to cope he should have. I reckon less drill Sgt vibes and more dad vibes are the way to go. It's easy to get frozen at that age when it feels like you gotta pick a path to adulthood and you don't know what you want. Doubly so if you feel your failing in the eyes of someone you desperately want approval from.\n\nYou want him to succeed, maybe see small steps you take with him, (and show you are proud of him for achieving) are worth trying to break the deadlock, rather than letting him just run out the clock on your patience.", "NTA, send him off to someone else.\nYou can lead a horse to water but you cannot force it to deink", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He\u2019s a kid. You\u2019re not broke or tight on money. You just finished building a home in Colorado. That doesn\u2019t come cheap. If you\u2019re going to help him grow into a man start with showing him that real men have compassion.", "[removed]", "I\u2019ve sat down with him a couple times asking what\u2019s going on. Why he\u2019s regressing? Why are new bad habits emerging? His answer is always the same. He wants to do something with his life but he\u2019s too lazy to do anything. I have since broken it down with him into goals to make, plans to make the goals happen, fail safes to secure the plans, and motivation for completed goals. I can only do so much when I leave for work and come home to the same story. He \u201cslept\u201d passed his alarms and didn\u2019t do anything but play on his computer all day. I feel like I\u2019m beating dead horse.", "He should try that with taking his weed, I bet he would go ballistic xD", "His motivation of staying is all but shot. At this point I only want him here to pay for my broken car. But I may do it sooner once the deal of him not affording food/rent arrises(2 months tops with his savings). He\u2019ll happily go back to his mom who\u2019ll let him walk all over her.", "Ha! I knew that looked weird. Silly me.", "Ha! I knew that looked weird. Silly me.", "What part of nightmare build that ruined our finances didn\u2019t you get? I guess you\u2019re right though. When that GC stole $22k from us and ran off and then we find out he lied about the costs putting us $50k over budget. That didn\u2019t hurt us at all because we built a home in Colorado. Guess me having to do all the excavation for the house(which the bank said I couldn\u2019t do) on top of my full time job just to break even didn\u2019t hurt at all. Begging my old boss for a screaming deal on the septic system otherwise we didn\u2019t have enough money from the bank\u2026 who was threatening foreclosure if we didn\u2019t finish fast enough. And the fact that we had to max out our credit cards to finally finish the build has zero bearing on our budget. Doesn\u2019t come cheap is right and I guess if you make your budget super tight so you can finally have property in the mountains\u2026 You still have all the money left over. Because it\u2019s a house built in Colorado? Yeah no, you\u2019re right. If you build something in Colorado you\u2019re obviously super wealthy.", "NTA. Perhaps reset the WiFi password every day.  Is he interested in the military? That may be the way to go.", "Aye I know. I believe you. As I said, I think for what it's worth, it would be good to spend the time doing some things with him. Not in a 'you can't do this by yourself' sort of way, but a 'lets spend time together and coincidentally achieve x' kind of way. \n\nI know time is likely something you don't have a lot of, but the kid doesn't seem hopeless. He wants to better himself, he came knowing he was leaving his easy living and was going to be expected to work. He did work and save a really decent chunk of money (even if he did some dumb teenage fuckup eventually.) \n\nI don't think he is lazy or wanting to mooch tbh, I think he's stuck and a bit depressed and anxious about his future. Playing video games and sleeping is his way of avoiding all that. Big overwhelming plans of all the shit that he needs to do just produce more anxiety and make him avoid harder, especially as the clock ticks down on how long he can stay. It's a paralysis cycle. \n\nNot having a way to get anywhere probably doesn't help him get out there and get a job if you're half way up a mountain. My only real advice would be start by helping him fix the car. Put a free day or two aside for it. I have a feeling once you get both of you into it for a weekend he might take the initiative to keep going (so long as he knows how to do the next step.)\n\nYeah he should fix it, but practically, getting stuck in with him does a few things. It achieves what you want, it gives him a goal that's more manageable than 'fix your life.' It gives you both quality time that's more organic and at the end (if your comfortable with still letting him use it) it gives him a heck lot more options to get out the house, even if it's to start by volunteering or whatever until he can get a job. \n\nYou aren't obligated to by any means, but it feels like you want to invest in this kid, but are also overwhelmed by trying to help him fix too much at once. Both of you need to take a beat, and build up from something do-able. \n\nIf that doesn't cut it, maybe start cutting the WiFi at midnight. (If you do, try and speak to him like an adult and get him to agree it's a good idea rather than treat it like a grounding.) He should have the opportunity to fix his bad habits by himself, but not being able to game all night and sleep all day will probably help.", "I don't see any ethical issues here tbh. You gave it your best shot, time to move on.", "It definitely is a catch 22 kind of thing. We went through a similar situation with our son. He had a job, car and spending money. He lost his job. Wrecked his car. Racked up a shit ton load of debt on his credit card and moved out because he disliked being hounded to be responsible for his actions. He ended up as a fry cook at A&W, had to file a consumer proposal because of his credit card debt. After spending a couple of years being a basement dweller at his friend\u2019s house, (3 males lacking motivation) and making shit wages while having more responsibility placed on his shoulders, minus the pay increase. He smartened up. He asked us to help him move to a relatively close large city. We agreed. Long story short. He got himself employed and found a reasonably priced bachelor suite, applied to attend first year schooling for an electrical apprenticeship and has been working in his chosen trade. He will be returning for second period schooling in the New Year and once that is complete he will be well on his way to being a third year electrical apprentice. It hasn\u2019t been an easy journey and from time to time he has needed a little extra support to make sure his cat is fed and the rent is paid. I cannot really speak to you about your situation. However, a conversation and a redefining of the rules between the three of you may provide the young man with a new outlook on life and motivation to meet expectations placed upon the him. Place the onus on the lad to get and keep his shit together. He pissed away the job you got him. Now he has to find his own employment. In the meantime maybe you all could work out a chore schedule and have him earn his keep that way until gainful employment has been secured. Make it very clear that he participates one way or the other. Let him know that there will be a one way bus ticket back to mother should he fall short of the mutually agreed upon expectations. You are not the asshole. The kid needs to grow up. He says he wants a positive father figure in his life. You are providing that. Let him know that. Place the burden of performance squarely on his shoulders and pick a mutually agreed upon time frame to show improvement or else, as agreed upon, the of consequences of his actions will be of his own doing. Re-enforce the fact that money is tight and he becomes an asset to the household or he can return to where he came from. Forgive me for rambling on. Good luck. I hope the best for you all.", ">Sending him home to NH is a death sentence to any growth but I don\u2019t think I have a choice\n\nPossibly.  Alternatively, it might be a wake up call.", "I would be more worried if he turns  to violence when force to fend for himself in the future if you keep enabling his moochers ass, i watch way too much true crime and my mind instantly went to Chandler Halderson or Joel Guy Jr, deal with it now otherwise it's gonna get difficult to get him to do something for himself, make an ultimatum and see it through", "I\u2019m sure you did old man, except things weren\u2019t 500% more expensive because of your generations greed and fuckery with the economy.", "Oh, so you\u2019re just dense. Anyone who maxes out their credit cards for a vanity project has no business guiding a young man in the right direction.", "I feel obligated to the kid though. He asked for help and I\u2019m failing him, just wish I could do more to essentially deprogram his last 18 years. But I\u2019m reminded of one of my drill instructors \u201c3 months won\u2019t fix 18 years of fuck up.\u201d Perhaps he\u2019s a lost cause. Damn", "The ramblings of a wise person. I appreciate you.", "I\u2019ve talked to him about joining. But I\u2019ve been in the military for 13 years and no way would he make it through basic with his commitment issues.", "Judging me for something you have no insight in. Yeah, I\u2019ll take your opinion with a grain of salt. Thanks for playing though.", "It feels like he\u2019s pushing for you to set some boundaries, the way a young child would, but he\u2019s 18 and not your kid. Your MIL has been guilty of very poor parenting and unless you want to spend serious time (and I mean years) fixing it, you need to send him away.", "I'm hearing a lot about tough love, but not a lot about love in your post and comments. I'm looking at this from a different angle as a former foster parent who dealt with traumatized kids. What has this kid's life been like? Did he ever have a safe and stable home?\n\nIt may be this boy was hoping to finally have a chance to be a kid before he becomes a man. To feel safe and loved by you and your wife. To have a chance to play and be silly and not stressed out.\n\nA lot of foster kids have to regress before they move forward. \n\nThis is gonna sound nuts to you, but please read it:\n\nWe gave our FD, who came to us at 13, permission to act like a baby or toddler when she needed to. We held her like a little kid. Read her stories, played little kid games. Let her sleep in and laze about.\n\nIt was contrary to all my ideas of discipline and what a kid that age \"should\" be doing. But she HAD to have that chance to move backwards, in order to move forward.\n\nI've known foster teens whose foster parents let them dress in footed pajamas and use bottles. Kids who grew up in either actual war zones,, or virtual ones (violent druggy parents) Those teens had to get those unmet needs for safety out of their systems. They couldn't move forward without that foundation.\n\nSometimes traumatized people have a profound need to rest, which can look like laziness and childishness. Did this kid ever get a chance to just be a safe kid? \n\nOur former FD is now an incredibly disciplined and responsible young business woman. She's got a great education, great investments, great friends, and an incredible moral compass.\n\nI suggest you take off the army boots for now. This kid might look 18, but he might feel 8. Let him be a kid for a while. Get him into therapy if he needs it.\n\nDiscipline comes from the inside, after love and compassion from surrounding adults allow a child to truly grow up. Stop seeing him as a lost cause.  Start seeing him as a scared kid who wants a loving dad, not a drill sargeant.", "Dude you\u2019re a jerk. He\u2019s a kid. You\u2019re a tight ass. You\u2019re not broke. You just build a home in the mountains, that doesn\u2019t come cheap.", "I think you should embrace your inner Hartman and start giving him a preview as \"rent\".  Reveille, white glove inspections, slaying him on the deck.  It'll either drive him screaming back to the White Mountains or make him shape up.", "Yeah, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re getting your money back for the car or the rent. \n\nThat said, the more I think about this, the more I\u2019m seeing another issue here at play. You said that his mother has always spoiled and enabled him, right? It\u2019s very possible that he doesn\u2019t know how to self motivate because he\u2019s never learned that skill. \n\nHe may need more than a talk. He likely needs almost a rubric of how to go forward. I\u2019m all for the \u201cpull yourself up by your bootstraps\u201d mentality, but if you\u2019ve literally never been made to do that and have had no reason to feel that intrinsically, I can imagine that he feels he has no path forward - because he doesn\u2019t even know how to get on the path. \n\nIt would be an infuriating amount of work, and you may be right that he\u2019s just lazy, but could you and your wife physically write weekly goals for him? Week 1 - contact the local trade schools in the area, obtain a course curriculum, determine cost and schedule, Week 2 - apply at 5 stores/restaurants in the area, Week 3 - do some other responsible things\u2026\n\nYou\u2019d be giving him the tools to make better decisions.", "I have enough insight.

Also, I had told him Tues night that he needed to get a dry erase board for his room to write down goals. I suppose I wouldn\u2019t be coddling him if I wrote them down for him.
