Anecdotally, the kindest thing my parents ever did for me was kick me out.   I was 21, not going to school, working at a dead end job to get enough money for weed and video games, and generally not doing anything else.  My parents talked with me both calmly and forcefully multiple times, before they finally hit me with the ultimatum of either paying a ridiculous amount of rent or moving out.  I couldn\u2019t afford their rent so they booted me.   I got an apt with roommates which was fucking miserable.  It took a couple years, but it eventually made me figure out that I either was going to be a loser or get my proverbial crap together. \n\nIt won\u2019t be easy.  Honestly, I bet it will really suck for you - talking with my parents about it years after the fact, I found out my mother cried for weeks after they booted me.  She was terrified for me.  \n\nThere are consequences to actions.  Best the young man learns that in a safe environment.

It may be harsh, but you're trying to help him out and he needs to make an effort to at least meet you halfway. Tell him that he couldn't collect unemployment or the like either without demonstrating a willingness to work and make his own way as possible, and you don't have the resources the government does so you're helping him because he's family.\n\nYou had an agreement and he's not abiding by it. You're obviously willing to cut him some slack and work through things if he's at least trying, but he's not.\n\nMaybe you and your wife need to talk with him about expectations. Helping with rent and food costs seems fair for an adult family member to do when they're living with you; at the *very least* he should help out with food. Myself, I wouldn't fuss about someone in the house sharing if I brought home a bucket of chicken or a pizza, but that's because I'd want to share, not because it's an assumption or expectation that I would.\n\nLong story short, he needs to wake up and take charge, and he needs to know that you're *far* more forgiving about all this than the government would be, for instance.", ">He claims that since he\u2019s family we should let him have our food and he shouldn\u2019t have to pitch.\n\nHow would he feel if he bought his own food and you ate it before he had a chance to, all without paying for it?\n\nHe's should not expect you to be any more generous with him than he is with you. \"But we're family!!

If he wanted to mooch he could do it there. He came to you, the family hard ass with, it seems, the intention to get his adult life started. He admires you and wanted that structure and kick up the ass. \n\nIt sounds like it went ok for a while and then he fell off the wagon so to speak. I wonder if his behaviour at the moment is less laziness and more avoidance/anxiety. He's fallen back into old habits because it's a safe space when he feels lost and like he's failing. \n\nHe might need a little less ass-riding and a bit more encouragment and understanding. Maybe, instead of telling him to go fix the car, and getting mad when he avoids it. Spend the quality time and do it with him, make it a bonding experience where he can feel like he achieved something and put something right. Let him open up about how he feels  and what's holding him back. \n\nHe's an adult, but he's very young and it doesn't sound like he ever got the tools to cope he should have. Maybe less drill Sgt vibes and more dad vibes are the way to go. It's easy to get frozen at that age when it feels like you gotta pick a path to adulthood and you don't know what you want. Small steps are worth trying rather than letting him just run out the clock on your patience.", "NTA, send him off to someone else.\nYou can lead a horse to water but you cannot force it to deink", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He will work somewhere, save enough money, quit or get fired and then coast until the money gets low again. You can\u2019t say anything because that was the \u201cdeal\u201d. \n\nI suggest revising the deal because he could potentially do this indefinitely. \n\nYou need to think about what you want for him and what he may want for himself. What does he want to do with his life? Would he consider college? Trade school? Apprenticeship? Would you consider reducing his rent a bit if he considered going to school and working part time?\n\nI think the biggest problem is that he doesn\u2019t have a goal and isn\u2019t working towards anything.", "Oh buddy the job opportunities I\u2019ve tried laying out for him.

Truthfully, he wants to go home, and we set a date for July because that\u2019s when he moved in last year. I want him gone sooner but\u2026 I need him to make money to fix my car he broke, he most certainly won\u2019t pay me back when he gets back to NH.\n\nYou are so right, he has no goals, and my last chat with him was to set goals, make plans and follow through rather than sleep in and game all day. He \u201cagreed\u201d and the next day\u2026 nothing. Which is why I was so quick to jump down his throat about the food.\n\nI caved already to my wife on the rent. I halved it until he got another job to make the Mrs. happy(she\u2019s stressed out enough).  But! He has to make up for it on the back end before he leaves.
