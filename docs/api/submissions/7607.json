Well two weeks ago I got a raised and a big bonus from work. It was a lot. So I decided to put most of the bonus money to pay off our school debt and saved 2000 to buy my wife a new ring. ( our wedding ring was a 20 dollar ring from Walmart)\n\nOn Sams birthday we got a cake from a bakery and she opened her present, she is three and loved the playdo and bubble. Her gifts were really cheap, the cake cost more. I then gave my wife her presents, showed her that we were debt free now and gave her the new ring. I have never seen her so happy and she finally looked stress free.\n\nToday I was talking to my sister and I told her about what we did on Sams birthday. She got super mad and told me that I was jerk for giving present to my wife on my daughters birthday.

I'd advise not to share your best moments with someone that negative. \n\nSidenote: when I was a teenager, I refused to celebrate my birthday with my family as I didn't like those family gatherings much.

Plus, she had no right to butt in and call your wife. At all. It was a beautiful, thoughtful gift for your wife, the mother of your child, after you've both been sacrificing.

Honestly, if your kid remembers this (probably not) she'll probably remember it fondly, as a time where her family was all happy and stress free.

I'd bet your kid will be happier with a less stressed mom and dad.", "NTA", "NTA. Your sister is nuts. The kid is 3 and won\u2019t remember.

He's also gotten me tokens of appreciation on our sons birthday like flowers, stuff for my business, and one year he gave me a necklace. Why? I dunno, I ask him and he shrugs with a smile. But I think it's because of what my son and I went through for him to be earth side (hello difficult pregnancy and delivery) and he's glad we're both still here. And after witnessing my sister give birth and the difficulties she went through, if her partner doesn't do something similar for her, I'll make sure to gift her her favorite sushi and red bull (the things she wanted and I Uber eated to her after birth).", "Seventh - Anytime is the right time to \"upgrade\" a wedding ring when your financial circumstances have changed...  if you know that's something your partner would appreciate and like.\n\nObviously this wonderful wife was happy with her $20 Walmart ring, but if a $2,000 jewelry store one would also make her happy, perfect!

I cant think of a reason other than pure jealousy... you did GREAT!", "NTA.    \nWhat you did was lovely!  A romantic gesture and a practical reduction of debt.  \n\nYour sister sounds like a very sour and presumptuous person.  Her \"getting mad at you\" for giving your wife a gift on your child's birthday is on the batshit crazy end of things.  And then calling your wife to tell her she should be ashamed?  Again, I'm not sure why you and your wife aren't registering how nuts and how utterly out of line this is.  \n \n\nI think your correct response at this point is to tear her a new one for upsetting your lovely wife, and then blocking her in every possible way, as in NC with someone who undermines your happiness.
