Well two weeks ago I got a raised and a big bonus from work. It was a lot. So I decided to put most of the bonus money to pay off our school debt and saved 2000 to buy my wife a new ring. ( our wedding ring was a 20 dollar ring from Walmart)\n\nOn Sams birthday we got a cake from a bakery and she opened her present, she is three and loved the playdo and bubble. Her gifts were really cheap, the cake cost more. I then gave my wife her presents, showed her that we were debt free now and gave her the new ring. I have never seen her so happy and she finally looked stress free.\n\nToday I was talking to my sister and I told her about what we did on Sams birthday. She got super mad and told me that I was jerk for giving present to my wife on my daughters birthday.

I'd advise not to share your best moments with someone that negative. \n\nSidenote: when I was a teenager, I refused to celebrate my birthday with my family as I didn't like those family gatherings much. My mom said she was fine with that but instead she would celebrate her giving birth to me then since she enjoyed having our family around.

Either she doesn't has someone and hates it and can't live with the fact others have happy relationships.
