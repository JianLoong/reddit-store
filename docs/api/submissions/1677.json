Her parents 37 f and 39m have warned her to stop already. The reason she's on this girl is because of the clothes she's wearing and also because this girl apparently has problems with hygiene. However, I don't believe it's by choice, because this girl is an \"out of area\" kid. Meaning, she's probably homeless, or in a less fortunate situation. My mom worked for the school district, so all of us are aware of how this district works.

My mom had to take care of 4 girls on her own because our dad passed and she had no help. \n\nAnyways, my niece has been on this girl's ass every single day and will NOT give her a break. They've taken away phones and tablets, grounded her, had talks to with her, everything you could imagine and she will not stop. So, I am a seamstress and a good one. I work for a high end company and I am booked and busy. So sometimes, I will make some cool pieces for my niece especially for events at dances and stuff. And recently, I made her a dress for her school dance. Her mom called me and explained the situation and asked to not give the dress to my niece because she's ungrateful and needs to stop bullying this poor girl. I agreed.  We decided that this dress can be modified for measurements (which I don't think it will be needed) and we will give this dress to the other girl. Hopefully to humble my niece and also, an apology to this other girl, even if it's from us. \n\nWell, her dad isn't happy with me. He called me separately yesterday to tell me that I made this dress for my niece, and it needs to go to my niece. That they don't even have enough time to find something else anyways. I told her that I respect his opinion, however she is out of control. We have all been the poor kids and our lives were hard enough and no one needs someone harassing them on top of things out of their control. So he told my niece and she gets hysterical on the phone.

Thanks for looking out for this poor kid.", "Another punishle t would be to have her volunteer for homeless people so she gets to see what their life is like and gain some empathy.

I don\u2019t have an idea for a cause but maybe something related?", "Aww that's so sweet! And no I do not, I am thinking of opening my passion project that will be a store.

Of course, meals and snacks will be paid for.

And the kid is unfortunately homeless, and I can definitely pay her a good wage. And hopefully it'll be useful to her.

You all need to collect stories of the consequences that bullies have faced and present them to dad letting him know either you all handle this as a family or eventually school/society will handle it for you, and they will probably be less kind. This kind of behavior can get her kicked out of school and mess up her college and job prospects.\n\n\n\nPlease note, I am not mentioning the moral implications because even though those are more important, I don't her dad will be able to see what a little troll has princess is.  Maybe share this post with him so he can see what others are saying?", "My first job I was about 15 and worked cash in hand at a dairy then I worked at a fish packing she'd where we packed frozen fish used in commercial fishing and when that dried up I worked for a local fisherman cleaning and filleting the catch. All of this was cash in hand after school but I was getting like $20-$50 bucks for each \"day\" I worked. If the girl wants to do something with her life she probably will jump at this opportunity. The only reason why she wouldn't would be the money will be taken off of her by her parents or someone else or she doesn't want to be seen as a charity case. But I know I jumped at having a job because I could buy my own things.", "Oh yeah that's a big possiblity or she'll pick on the wrong kid and big brother or sister will come raining hellfire.

Your niece needs to go without for a bit.", "I honestly don't know the answer to that, but he gets defensive over their daughter", "That was my next question. Odd relationship for parenting.", "Sounds to me like Dad might be part of the problem.", "Not only that but if he is doing this a lot, especially when it comes to punishment for bullying...that could be why she hasn't stopped....she knows that Dad will bail her out.", "Agreed.
