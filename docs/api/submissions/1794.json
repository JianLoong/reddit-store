Your aunt was trying to take advantage of you. Good for you for standing your ground.", "If I'm being generous, I'd say your aunt has lost her mind to fear and grief, and she's flailing around for anything that would make her idea of her child's life right now seem better. I am sure the young patient isn't focused on getting a share of your collection, it's just her mom who fixed on the idea.\n\nShe's way out of line, even if she can't see it at this moment.

Like $100 each between 5 adults.", "it would be different if she at least ASKED not demanded", "I have 2 human hair wigs the other being a little more expensive and apparently I have to give the one I mentioned because it fits her and looks more natural other than that I have synthetic or ones that don't look very realistic.", "Don't give her the human hair ones. You shouldn't have to give up something you worked hard for.\n\n If the other's are unacceptable, maybe you can suggest her mom look into charities that give kids with hair loss wigs. I know there are a few of them.", "NTA. No one has the right to demand anything from anyone. She\u2019s probably upset and fearful, but that doesn\u2019t mean you demand other people\u2019s property. She also probably has no idea it was $500. Most people do not know how much wigs cost.", "NTA. I had cancer as a teenage girl back when the only wigs available were hard fronts. I got the nicest one I could, wore it about five times and hated how it felt. I can\u2019t imagine a child having any patience with it. Your wig is very expensive and you worked hard for it. Many charities help with nice, free wigs nowadays; they can easily get one from there.", "I had 2 or 3 beautiful wigs in high school too. My favorite was one that was half pink and half black and cost me almost $600. A friend from high school asked for it and then stole it when I said no. I tracked her down and got it back but it was seriously a challenge that involved law enforcement and grandparents. Lol/smh. \nCase in point, don't come between a woman and her wigs.

It\u2019s rude and selfish to demand a gift. It\u2019s beyond rude to demand a very expensive gift.", "Nta. Dont give it to them. \n\nThey can buy one themselves or check into charities that help kids with cancer. I believe there are some that will give wigs to kids for free or very cheap. \nYou shouldnt have to give up your property you paid for, just because she likes it.", "NTA she is making a demand of your belongings. She has a lot of nerve. NO if she wants her daughter to have a wig then she needs to get off her butt and buy one. And not make demands on a 17 year old.", "NTA\n\nthat's expensive asf and to expect your teenage niece to just hand it over? That's rude!", "Nta", "NTA she should have asked for the info to purchase one for your cousin, not demanded you give her yours.", "NTA\n\nThey are being really unfair.\n\nBut they have had a really scary diagnosis for their much loved child. They aren't thinking rationally.\n\nCan you email your Mum/ Mom, the cousin's Dad plus the aunt on one email or WhatsApp group?\n\nApologise that it's all got heated ( not for not giving that wig) and offer a link to the wig you bought? Then a link to a less expensive version of the same style? They will see how expensive it is.\n\nGoogle charities like Locks of Love or the Little Princess Trust ( I'm UK based) in your country. There will be some help with wigs for kids with cancer. Get hospital will know someone on the area. Then your little cousin will have one which fits a child size head not an adult size?\n\nTheir reactions will tell you a lot but please don't give that wig to your cousin when you are being bullied into it. State that it doesn't fit, it won't stay on etc on your email. A hard wearing synthetic is better for a kid as wigs need maintenance. \n\nI send you good wishes and luck to your cousin.", "NTA and no one can demand you give anyone anything! That is yours and you paid a lot of money you earned yourself for it.", "She shouldn\u2019t demand things from the OP, but I am pretty positive the aunt didn\u2019t know it was $500. People do not understand how expensive wigs can be.", "This answer is 10/10.\n\nNTA.", "My first thought when I read this was would the wig even properly fit the child? She's nine. She is not at her full height and development. Where I am, wigs and hats are in child and adult sizes. I am guessing that a 17 year old would buy an adult wig while a 9 year old would need a child size. So, will it even fit properly?\n\nDid the girl want the wig? She plays with it and likes it but that's a whole other ball game from wanting to wear a wig. Many children and adults do not want to wear wigs. Instead they wear hats or bandanas if they need to. \n\nWhy did the girl's mother think you would give the girl a wig from your collection? Why did she think it was  appropriate to demand that you do so? You are 17, she is an adult. If her child wants a wig, she needs to take the girl to be fitted and get her an appropriate wig.\n\nNTA. You are not required to give your wig away and there many reasons not to do so. Your aunt, however, is a big A for demanding it.", "NTA, maybe bring up starting a fundraiser, like bake sales or lemonade stand?", "NTA. And as a precaution, I'd make sure your good wigs are under lock and key until your family leaves--I wouldn't put it past your aunt to try and steal it.", "NTA - and I would hide/secure your wig collection. I wouldn't put it past your aunt to steal it, and/or ruin it and the others.", "NTA your aunt is trying to take advantage and get a free wig", "NTA you bought them and five hundred is a LOT for a gift (at any age, but especially yours\u2019). It sucks that this is happening for everyone.", "NTA. It would have been more well received if she asked respectfully and offered to pay. We were so grateful for any help we received during cancer, but we never expected special treatment.\n\nAlso, I recently found my old synthetic wig collection buried under my costume stuff! I have about 20. So just know you aren't the only one hahahaha", "NTA. I would\u2019ve told auntie \u201cI\u2019ll send you a link to the wig\u201d but expecting a 17 year old to fund or give her the wig is ridiculous.\n\nEither she doesn\u2019t understand the price range (sounds like you told her though), doesn\u2019t believe good wigs cost that much (unfortunately shell soon learn), or she can\u2019t really afford it, or would just prefer not to take on the cost and would instead prefer to vilify a 17 year old to so instead.\n\nI can imagine her bills are likely in jeopardy because cancer is expensive but that doesn\u2019t give her the right to shift her sights on a freakin 17 year old.\n\nHonestly the best path here, if you feel like acting more mature than an adult (don\u2019t blame you if you don\u2019t) is to ask if she would like to set up a go fund me for the wig and maybe you could contribute a little bit of money towards it, if you would LIKE to.\n\nBut honestly, my heart goes out to a mom with a child with cancer, but asking a 17 year old to fork over a 500$ wig, just because she has it, is disrespectful.", "NTA. Your aunt is TA. Contact just the cousin and offer to help her find a wig that will fit her small head and be easy to care for. There is no need to give her a $500 wig, but she needs something and you are the logical person to look to for help. You don't have to help, but they may change your relationship with her.", "NTA $500 isn't chump change", "NTA - You should not be forced to give an expensive possession to your cousin because she has cancer. The parent should be looking to purchase one for her IF she wants one.", "NTA- but you should help her pick out a wig for herself! You have a unique expertise here! Something relatively inexpensive but would be well loved. You're 17, a $500 USD gift is completely uncalled for. A 9 year old should really never be given such an expensive good gift. But a $20-$50 USD gift would be very kind of you. \n\nMaybe don't interact with this particular aunt tho. This was very rude and uncalled for on her part, and I wouldn't be surprised if she said something along the lines of \"you can't have a wig because your big cousin won't let you\" and that that's the cause of the rift between the two of you.", "ESH... \nYour cousin is fighting for her life and all you can think about is a wig? \n Family is supposed to be there for eachother. Your Aunt is wrong for trying to force you... but it's really telling of your heart that you didn't want to give it to her.", "NTA. But, you've just let your cousin know you care more about money than her. Going forward, what kind of relationship do you want with her while she's potentially dying?", "No one is obligated to give something they don't wanna. This is a 17 years old, going through her own issues but your 'heart' is she parts with something so vital to her and go about feeling bad about gifting? \n\nNo. She offered other less expensive ones but they want to dictate what she must give? Nope.", "Are you the aunt in question? Or one of the OP's relatives?", "So OP should just let her aunt and family take advantage of her?\n\nThe young child may not be dying and who says that the wig would even fit her?", "Presentation counts. \n\nAsk vs demand. Body language. All of this makes a difference. \n\nA gift should be given out of the goodness of one's heart. Not because someone else wants it. I feel for the cousin with cancer, but still there is a right way and a wrong way to request the wig. The aunt did the wrong way.", "Even then, you're an adult dealing with a kid - even if you're asking, you offer to pay.", "Human hair wigs, as well as being expensive, take an *awful* lot of looking after. They're not so much a possession as a responsibility!", "You\u2019re NTA at all OP. Honestly, if I were you, I would tell your aunt (or better yet tell someone else within ear shot of your aunt) how embarrassing it is for an adult to ask a 17 year old for a 500 dollar wig they worked their butt off for when it\u2019s aunts job to provide for her child, not a literal teenagers. What will people think of her when that gets out? That she had to beg a child for something because she is too lazy to work for it herself for her own kid? Maybe they will think she can\u2019t provide for her child in other ways. Tsk tsk.", "Wow. People have really become sanctimonious in their own selfishness. No, she's not obligated. That is the point of charity and good will. \nEsh", "Honestly in this case there's no right way to ask for a present. You offer to buy it, that's the right way here."]}
