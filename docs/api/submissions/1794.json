She is not at her full height and development. Where I am, wigs and hats are in child and adult sizes. I am guessing that a 17 year old would buy an adult wig while a 9 year old would need a child size. So, will it even fit properly?\n\nDid the girl want the wig? She plays with it and likes it but that's a whole other ball game from wanting to wear a wig. Many children and adults do not want to wear wigs. Instead they wear hats or bandanas if they need to. \n\nWhy did the girl's mother think you would give the girl a wig from your collection? Why did she think it was  appropriate to demand that you do so? You are 17, she is an adult. If her child wants a wig, she needs to take the girl to be fitted and get her an appropriate wig.\n\nNTA.

What will people think of her when that gets out? That she had to beg a child for something because she is too lazy to work for it herself for her own kid?

The aunt would have been better off asking you for advice on wig shopping than demanding an extremely expensive wig from you surely? I mean, maybe I'm making a lot of assumptions, but a 500 dollar wig sounds like it might require maintenance that would be a lot to expect of a 9 year old going through intensive medical treatments, and most likely there are charities that could help the mom choose and pay for a wig more suited to her daughter. Having a cousin that collects and wears wigs could have been a really valuable 'resource' for the mom and the kid, the mom could get advice and the kid might feel better and more comfortable with wigs knowing that their cousin wears them, but instead the mom decided to demand you give up something you worked hard to pay for that the daughter may not even be able to get the best use out of.", "NTA tell everyone she is asking you to gift her 9 year old $500 it took you a long time to save up for that and it is too expensive for you to be able to replace.
