Are they aware it costs $500 and do you think your family could all chip in or could they start a GoFundMe or similar to buy a wig her size? You shouldn\u2019t have to give anything of yours unless you wish to do so, regardless of cost.", "NTA,  but your aunt is greedy and enabling behavior to your cousin that it's ok to demand things without working hard for them. Your aunt was trying to take advantage of you. Good for you for standing your ground.", "If I'm being generous, I'd say your aunt has lost her mind to fear and grief, and she's flailing around for anything that would make her idea of her child's life right now seem better. I am sure the young patient isn't focused on getting a share of your collection, it's just her mom who fixed on the idea.\n\nShe's way out of line, even if she can't see it at this moment.

I am sure your aunt is just crazed with a child who has cancer, and isn't thinking straight.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to just give your cousin an expensive wig because your aunt told you to.

Like $100 each between 5 adults.", "it would be different if she at least ASKED not demanded", "I have 2 human hair wigs the other being a little more expensive and apparently I have to give the one I mentioned because it fits her and looks more natural other than that I have synthetic or ones that don't look very realistic.", "Don't give her the human hair ones. You shouldn't have to give up something you worked hard for.\n\n If the other's are unacceptable, maybe you can suggest her mom look into charities that give kids with hair loss wigs. I know there are a few of them.", "NTA. No one has the right to demand anything from anyone. She\u2019s probably upset and fearful, but that doesn\u2019t mean you demand other people\u2019s property. She also probably has no idea it was $500. Most people do not know how much wigs cost.", "NTA. I had cancer as a teenage girl back when the only wigs available were hard fronts. I got the nicest one I could, wore it about five times and hated how it felt. I can\u2019t imagine a child having any patience with it. Your wig is very expensive and you worked hard for it. Many charities help with nice, free wigs nowadays; they can easily get one from there.", "I had 2 or 3 beautiful wigs in high school too. My favorite was one that was half pink and half black and cost me almost $600. A friend from high school asked for it and then stole it when I said no. I tracked her down and got it back but it was seriously a challenge that involved law enforcement and grandparents. Lol/smh. \nCase in point, don't come between a woman and her wigs.

It\u2019s rude and selfish to demand a gift. It\u2019s beyond rude to demand a very expensive gift.", "Nta. Dont give it to them. \n\nThey can buy one themselves or check into charities that help kids with cancer. I believe there are some that will give wigs to kids for free or very cheap. \nYou shouldnt have to give up your property you paid for, just because she likes it.", "NTA she is making a demand of your belongings. She has a lot of nerve. NO if she wants her daughter to have a wig then she needs to get off her butt and buy one. And not make demands on a 17 year old.", "NTA\n\nthat's expensive asf and to expect your teenage niece to just hand it over? That's rude!", "Nta", "NTA she should have asked for the info to purchase one for your cousin, not demanded you give her yours.", "NTA\n\nThey are being really unfair.\n\nBut they have had a really scary diagnosis for their much loved child. They aren't thinking rationally.\n\nCan you email your Mum/ Mom, the cousin's Dad plus the aunt on one email or WhatsApp group?\n\nApologise that it's all got heated ( not for not giving that wig) and offer a link to the wig you bought? Then a link to a less expensive version of the same style? They will see how expensive it is.\n\nGoogle charities like Locks of Love or the Little Princess Trust ( I'm UK based) in your country. There will be some help with wigs for kids with cancer. Get hospital will know someone on the area. Then your little cousin will have one which fits a child size head not an adult size?\n\nTheir reactions will tell you a lot but please don't give that wig to your cousin when you are being bullied into it. State that it doesn't fit, it won't stay on etc on your email. A hard wearing synthetic is better for a kid as wigs need maintenance. \n\nI send you good wishes and luck to your cousin.", "NTA and no one can demand you give anyone anything! That is yours and you paid a lot of money you earned yourself for it.", "She shouldn\u2019t demand things from the OP, but I am pretty positive the aunt didn\u2019t know it was $500. People do not understand how expensive wigs can be.", "This answer is 10/10.\n\nNTA."]}
