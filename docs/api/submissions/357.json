I have been every year since I was a freshman and given that I am a senior this year it was my opportunity to help plan it.\n\nI was asked to handle the costume contest. I was the head judge. The way it works is that all the other organizations choose one member of their group to submit for the best costume and we pick one male org and one female org member to win.\n\nIn past years, I have never particularly liked how the costumes were judged. The male costumes were always good, but the female costumes were just not great. They went with the typical girl Halloween costume. We always had some girls that show up in real costumes and not just string and a prop. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that, for obvious reasons I love when the girls wearing string costumes show up to parties and get a lil wet and wild, but they obviously shouldn\u2019t be winning the costume contest.\n\nSo the party was Friday night and once the costume contest started I and the co judges were picked. I told them off the jump that were only judging real costumes. One was okay with this and on my side the other was not, but 2/3 so we had to go with my rules.\n\nWe looked at each contestant and we\u2019re easily able to pick out the male winner. The female winner was a bit harder. Only one chick was in a real costume (well real by comparison). My idea was she won by default as no one else was in a costume.\n\nThis girl was in a Trixie Tang costume from\nFairly Odd Parents. The other judge was not a fan of it so she did not want her to win. But all the other girls weren\u2019t in costumes. We debated it before I said that I would just say whoever she said was the winner to get her to shut her mouth. This was a lie and when I announced the winner, I explicitly said that Trixie Tang won because she has the best actual costume of all of the lady entries.\n\nThe other judge was mad and the girls from the losing groups were not happy. They said I judged unfairly. The president of my org co-signed my decision and said that the outcome was fine. We awarded the prize and everything was cool, but after that, none of the girls from the orgs that lost wouldn\u2019t talk to me. The other judge told me I was a dick and lied to her which I guess is true, but our house our rules and our pr\u00e8s.
