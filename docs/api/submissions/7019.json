My 7yr old daughter wanted harry potter [books, so](https://books.So) I got her a kindle and the full harry potter set. My son wanted a PS5, and a guitar for Christmas, and we have tried for years to get our hands on a ps5, but they were never in stock online, or at the store. In the meantime, I have saved up to buy one for him. Just before Christmas, his dad and I got him a PS5, a guitar plus a year of lessons from fender. We never told him we got anything, so we really wanted this to be a surprise for him.\n\nWe have a very big and close family and every holiday we get together for dinner, exchanging presents etc and that coming Christmas was no different, except the kids won't get their $100 like they do every year since my father, who gives them money every year, is in the hospital. It was time to get the kids together to open presents. His aunt, and grandmother had some presents for my kids. The girls had makeup, jewelry, small things from them. My son got socks, and a watch from them. This was before he opened the rest of his presents. My son went into a brief tirade and making it clear that he didn't like it and wanted his PS5 and $100. My sister and MIL were taken aback. Without saying anything, I grabbed the rest of his unopened presents with his name on it, and gave it to my 11-year-old nephew, who then opened the presents and was happy to get a ps5 and a guitar. My son cried, told me he hates me and ran to his room. I was going to pull him and talk to him privately anyway. I went to his room to briefly explained to him why I gave his presents to his cousin. He made an extremely rude comment about the presents he received. I told him that he didn't have to like the presents, but he needs to be graceful about it and say thank you, and expressing dislike is really rude. Told him that I'm taking away his Nintendo switch, and he will lose computer and game privileges for a month with an apology required at the end.\n\nMy son started screaming at me to go away and he hates me. Which I left to spend the rest of the day with family. My sister told me that I didn't need to give her son his presents as he has plenty of gifts at home. I told her it was ok, and I apologized to her, and I would make sure my son makes amends for what he said.\n\nThinking back, I felt I was too harsh on him and never took his ADHD and autism into account when I punished him, on top of the fact that he is the only person that got nothing for Christmas.

It's not that unusual for 13 year olds to be rude and selfish.  \n\nYes, you should discipline him for his rude comments, but taking his main present away from him is disproportional, and super pretty, and it will probably have the opposite of the intended effect, and instead of helping him be more grateful for what he does have, it will make him think that his mother is an asshole.  And he'll be right!", "YTA. Seriously? He's a kid (one with ADHD and ASD, no less). They're all ungrateful little shits. He made a throwaway snotty comment, and you take all of his stuff away from him? Yeah, hun, you were entirely too harsh. His future therapist is going to have a field-day with this.", "YTA.  You over reacted.  I don't know how long its going to take for your son to forgive you.  Might be years.  He will certainly never forget this and that's not a good thing.", "EDIT based on OP's comments YTA OP. The punishment doesn't fit the crime and you kind of set your son up for failure\n\n\nOld information request :Did he even know he had more presents? He also has ADHD and ASD. From your post this doesn't sound like a common occurrence either.", "YTA- Way to bury the lead. Your autistic son was upset about a change in a yearly tradition and your response was to make sure he got nothing for Christmas except for the gifts that upset him in the first place.  \n\nThe punishment should have just been no electronics for an amount of time. NOT taking away his Christmas gifts that he was specifically looking forward to.", "> I was going to pull him and talk to him privately anyway.\n\nWould have been a good idea to do that BEFORE you decided to make a dramatic gesture. \n\nYTA. You ruined your kids' xmas, and sounds like either he has an ongoing issue with entitlement (which would be in your court to work on) or was having a bad day overall. You went nuclear and now you're going to probably spend years fixing the relationship with your son.", "YTA\n\nCome on, he's 13, autistic, and has ADHD? Can you give him a little bit of a break? You say you gave the gifts to the cousin 'without a word' -- not even a quick exchange like \"you still have more gifts to open and your aunt took time and money to get these for you, so you should show some gratitude instead\" or something? Definitely harsh.\n\nI appreciate that you guys are struggling and pulled together the best Christmas you could, and that snotty and rude comments from pubescent teenagers shouldn't fly without some kind of discipline, but this seems over the top...", "OMG WTF is wrong with you\u2026. On what planet is this the appropriate response to a child being a child.\n\nYTA", "YTA. I think you acted with some of your own embarrassment at the time and handed down a punishment that didn\u2019t match the crime. Sure take them away at the time but don\u2019t hand them to someone else right in front of him. \n\nThe other thing too is by the sound of what other toys he has for you to take away, he\u2019s been pretty spoiled in the past with gifts. You can\u2019t expect a kid with spoiled expectations to not act spoiled when this expectations aren\u2019t met. Especially a 13 year old.", "YTA, parenting is hard but this seems like an incredibly obvious overstep. There were MANY ways you could have punished this without literally giving his gifts to someone else. Now he\u2019s going to be mad at you for who knows how long and you may very well have permanently ruined his relationship with his cousin.", "Saying being to harsh is an understatement. You have ruined your relationship with your son. Was this the hill to die on, worth it? There could have been other punishments. Are you married if you are divorced he could want to go live with his dad and you might end up paying \nchildsupport. YTA Edit. How are going to fix or salvage this problem?", "YTA\n\nyou set him up...his reaction was exactly as you knew it would be...then you punshi him.\n\nYou owe him an apology and to get his gifts back...which will now also upset your nephew.\n\nYou were cruel.", "YTA It would have been fine maybe if you decided not to give the gift to him that day, but give it a day or two later when he apologizes. But giving it completely away after all that effort of getting what he wanted? That\u2019s too far.", "YTA for embarrassing him and bringing other kid\u2019s emotions into this. Now your nephew and sister are in an awkward position and your sons never gonna look at that ps5 without remembering all that pain. Punishments are handled in private, especially when you\u2019re upset over his poise. What did he learn? Mom can act like that?", "YTA \nYour son with ADHD & autism is going to have trouble with self-control and, as an adult, you are the one who should model and teach it to him. Instead you reacted quickly and without thinking things through and you broke a line of trust a possibly a relationship. He will never forget what you did. \nYou can attempt to make amends, but this falls on you. You owe him an apology at the very least.", "YTA - but hear me out. I agree with your lesson. Your son should learn that he needs to grateful for what he receives and not expect gifts. I would personally have took the gifts away, but I disagree with the regifting to his cousin. What did the cousin do that deserves extra gifts? Is your son going to have some revelation about his ungratefulness or is he likely going to resent you and his cousin, for giving his gifts away and for receiving his gifts through no extra merit. \n\nIn terms of the ADHD and autism I cannot speak on how these maybe need to be handled differently. \n\nI would have confiscated the gifts until your son could demonstrate the required maturity/grateful behaviour you would expect of him.", "YTA. Without question.", "YTA for being too harsh and acting too rashly. You are gonna need more effective parenting tools in your kit for the angry teen years ahead.", "YTA. What the hell is wrong with you?! And talk about burying the lede. Do you resent your son for being autistic?", "YTA. You clearly don\u2019t love your child. Else you wouldn\u2019t have don\u2019t such a sadistic thing as giving his presents to someone else. After that you took away all of his entertainment in life. No, you must actually really hate your child. I hope he will recover from this, and that he will get the happiness and love he deserves despite having faults. His mother being the greatest one.", "YTA, I was with you until I learned your son had autism, therefore would likely have some undeveloped/underdeveloped social skills. I hope you guys can really work this out \ud83d\ude42.", "YTA and your son is following in your footsteps. You could\u2019ve said \u201cjust for that tirade/comment, you won\u2019t have access to these presents for a month until you learn to be polite and grateful for the gifts\u201d and then gifted him the presents.", "I\u2019m gonna have to go with a gentle YTA. \n\nI agree your son was being bratty, but i don\u2019t think you handled it correctly. Kids are jerks, by nature. And it\u2019s our job as parents to teach them to get along with others.\n\nThis moment could have been a teachable moment. I imagine his ADHD only made him more impatient?\n\nBut now with this severe punishment he\u2019s just filled with anger and frustration and I don\u2019t think he will learn anything productive from this, and just learn to resent you and your husband, and probably his cousin. He isn\u2019t going to see how his punishment was warranted by his comment.", "Yta", "YTA I can't believe you did that to your own child yes he's throw a fit but he's a bloody child. Also if I was your sister there's no way in hell I would of allowed my son to accept that present", "YTA.  You overreacted hugely to a child behaving like a child and cruelly put him in a situation to hate his cousin with your spite.  Wtf.", "YTA\n\nThat was so extreme and final. He will likely never get a PS5 now. \n\nWhy on earth wouldn't you confiscate it for a week or a month instead? You telling him he now would not be able to play it for X amount of time before he opened it would have taught exactly the same lesson and been proportionate.\n\nEdit: also, he has no incentive to behave now because you already went nuclear. You can't take his presents away twice. If you confiscated them you could have extended how long he had to wait until he started acting right.", "YTA. First, it's like you've never met a teenage boy. And your son has challenges he's dealing with in addition to being a giant, raging hormone. You just did a number on that poor kid.", "YTA, for a couple of reasons.\n\n1) Kneejerk reacting is a shitty, unproductive parenting method.\n\n\n2) You made his cousin an unconsenting part of the punishment you impulsively doled out, which is not okay.  You don't pull innocent bystanders  in. All you did was make him a potential target of your son's future resentment and used that poor kid as a weapon. \n\n\n3) Your hot-headedness didn't accomplish a single thing. I can guarantee your kid didn't learn a lesson about gratitude and humility. How could he through the deep and seething bitterness,  anger and resentment you filled him to the brim with?\n\n\nWith his first complaint, you should've calmly taken him from the room and had a quiet, caring discussion with him. Depending on how the discussion went, you could've chosen to hold some of his presents back until you had a chance to discuss further. The whole thing could've been handled with mild correction at most but instead, you chose intensely  harsh and punitive. It's quite shocking how swiftly you went that route and suggests that you parent from a place of punishment and not from loving guidance and discipline. \n\nYes, his impulsive, thoughtless reaction wasnt great but *your* impulsive, thoughtless reaction was *significantly* worse. He at least has the excuse of being *a literal child whose brain isnt done developing*.", "YTA, while his behavior was bratty your response was cruel.  It would have been better to pull him aside and correct his behavior.  But to actually give his presents away was really just mean spirited.", "Yeah, YTA. 13 is a rough age regardless. Being a gracious recipient is something that should be modeled for children and not punished into them. Also, what does his dad think about how this was handled? Sounds like both of you worked hard to save up for this, but your decision was made unilaterally.", "YTA! That should have been a moment to teach not a moment to punish, what an awful thing to do. You didn\u2019t have to let them have them right away, but giving his things to another child? That\u2019s just spiteful and damaging to their relationship.", "YTA", "You acted emotionally and impulsively, because you felt embarassed and likely judged for your son's behavior.\n\nADHD is often inherited and we now know where he got it from. Impulsiveness, difficulties with emotional regulation and rejection sensitivity are all linked to ADHD. Your behavior strongly implies you are unaware and not yet actively trying to compensate these weak spots, so an adult ADHD evaluation is something you might want to consider.\n\nAlso, YTA, obviously what you did was a completely disproportionate overreaction that will mess up family dynamics for years if not decades, all because you chose to punish your son for your inability to deal with embarassment.", "YTA. It's normal to teach a lesson\nBut you chose sides and humiliated him. And over exaggerated punishment \n\nYou just need to talk about being grateful.\n\nYou're a horrible mother.\n\nI won't be surprised if your son will be s*icidal", "YTA. You need to apologize to your nephew and son and get those presents back. You did not even just take them away to wait for an apology or something. You literally gave them away and made him watch someone else get what he wanted.", "Geezus you are 1000% the AH. You gave his gifts away, grounded him for a month and took away his other devices?! What effing planet do you live on? \n\nThis has to be made up\n\nYTA\nYTA\nYTA\nYTA\nYTA\nEdit to ad.

You didn't teach him how to be grateful.

Tonight she walked into her little brother's room and shut off the light and then pulled the door shut causing him to scream in terror. It sucked. When I questioned her about it, she didn't know why she did it, she just felt a sudden need and went with it. I have to figure out how to teach her impulse control, but I already know (because I've tried) that harsh, sudden punishment only elicits worse behavior. \n\nI don't know how things work with your son, but the best way I've found for my daughter is to work on empathy. Tonight we talked about how Her brother must have felt and what it would be like to suddenly not be able to see or find the door. Her outbursts and poor impulses have significantly decreased since I've worked on empathy with her. Still occasionally she follows a really bad impulse.\n\nTo me, it sounds like your son was disappointed with his first couple gifts and his impulse was to say something about it. At least he didn't go into a fit of rage at his second gift and break the other kids gifts, because ADHD is also uncontrollable tantrums. \n\nWhat's done is done. You can't rewind time, but you messed up bad. When I do stupid things, I pull my daughter aside and admit my mistakes, with no \"buts\" or rationals. Only that I made a major screw up and I didn't think about how much it would hurt her. Then I try to be creative about how to fix it. Be honest with your son, tell him that you messed up and that you are sorry. Talk about how to make things right. He's always going to have poor impulse control, he should probably see you work to make things right because he'll probably be doing a lot of that himself. \n\nI'm hesitant to call YTA, because I understand how hard it can be to deal with a kid who should know better. Add to that the embarrassment of having him lose impulse control in front of family, who don't understand and expect you to deal with him like any other kid and I get why you did it.

Remember this when he is older with his own life and has as little to no contact with you as possible.\n\nThere is a way to fix this by busting your ass and making it up to him as much as possible, (admittedly of course make him apologize for the tasteless comment)", "Holy moly, YTA. You wouldn't be if you had just made him apologize for his comment or made him wait a day or two for the guitar and PS5, but taking that all away and giving it to someone else to open in front of him was just spiteful and cruel.", "YTA.  I'm wondering how you gave so much on a whim to the nephew after an ungrateful comment from your son.  Like you screwed everyone.  Although you messed up, do NOT ask for the gifts back for your son.  You'll be making things even worse for your nephew and sister.  It's too late.  You gave your nephew the gifts.  Tough shit on you.  Don't put your sister in that position either.  You've done enough damage involving them when they shouldn't have been.  Leave them alone.  Get him another guitar and lessons.  It may take a while, but you can still be on the lookout for the PS5.      Talk to him about this, about being grateful, and how you are working on making it up to him.  I'm a little scared for how uncomfortable next Christmas will be for your family.", "Wtf!!! YTA. The only lesson he's going to learn here is his mum is an AH who obviously can't parent very well. I can not believe you gave all his presents away. You really need help lady and you need to read a book or two on ADHD and autism. Your a terrible mother!", "Omg YTA. making him issue an apology and not letting him use his ps5 or any other gaming or guitar for a month would have been a better and more appropriate punishment.  You went way overboard. You owe your kid an apology and his 2 gifts back (with the understanding that he's grounded from those gifts for a month)", "YTA- you ruined Christmas not just for your son (who is a child, aside from the ASD/ADHD combo, which is wicked on an adult much less a little boy) but everyone who saw your ridiculous display. This is a little boy, he doesn\u2019t REALLY have the grasp on money or social graces you do, especially since it seems he\u2019s used to getting video games and such so there\u2019s no reason he shouldn\u2019t expect it. Obviously a punishment/correction is needed here, but this wasn\u2019t about changing behavior, it\u2019s about making him upset. You knew he\u2019d probably cry and freak out, he\u2019s your kid, you GAVE THEM AWAY instead of just TAKING THEM FROM HIM, good luck with his therapist in 10 years. Poor kid dude.", "Yta", "Wow. No wonder he hates you lmao. Good job mom\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d", "YTA\n\nTo be fair, I don\u2019t know you\u2019re thought process.. BUT, my impression\u2026 \n\nAs a parent, you felt embarrassed in front of your family, by your child, at a big family event. And chose to punish him because of your ego. The only reason I say that, is because his ADHD and autism were an after thought to you in the moment. Making your ego win out.. I have parents with large egos and this is definitely they\u2019re vibe..", "YTA. OMG giving his gifts away and not let him get anything? Your sister gave him a sock and you gave her kid a ps5 and a guitar? \n\nThat kid will hate you for the rest of his life. Great parenting!", "Just curious... Have you been tested for ADHD? Your response was also impulsive and extreme, and makes me wonder if you need help with your executive function", "YTA but not for the reason(s) you might think. Should he have gotten his presents?  No of course not, but they also shouldn't have been given away either. Open everything else, take the rest of the presents for next year. But this also isn't why I've given you the YTA judgement here.  \n\n\nYou get the YTA judgement because your son is 13 and still thinks this type of behavior is appropriate. ADHD and Austism are important factors, but at 13 they should know right from wrong. You get the YTA judgement because up til this point, you've failed your son. Failed to teach him the ways of the world that he should know about. Failed to teach him that kindness is always the better option. Failed to teach him that christmas is about people not things.", "Immediately upon reading I thought this child has impulse control problems likely ADHD because this sounds like my nephew and my son. And then lo and behold you casually tossed that in at the end. Look, I understand how embarrassing it can feel to have your child act like an ungrateful little shit in front of family. But no one knows him like you do, not even your family. You should have handled it the same way you would have had they not been there. And you know you would have handled it differently.

I don't blame you for being upset but he has asd, he's gonna be need to be treated a lil bit differently.

I surprised he doesn't hate you. Oh wait, he says he does. Talk about an over reaction. You certainly did.", "Honestly this is a tough one. But I\u2019m leaning towards NTA. As much as this lesson will suck for your son I feel you have now provided him with a very unique understanding of what Xmas is really about. I can guarantee you he has learned his lesson.\n\nNow I wonder what your husband might say about the guitar lessons and the PS5 costs (assuming over 1k) but that is your conflict with him to have.\n\nMay I now suggest you help your son get a paper route to understand the value of money? (I worked a paper route at 13 and saved up for the xbox360 at the time)", "You are so much more than YTA.", "You know YTA. You WAY over reacted. Especially with an adhd kid. You just punished him for something he probably can\u2019t control. Buckle up, you\u2019ll have a lot of work to do to rebuild that relationship.", "Wow YTA. And did you ever bury the lede regarding his ND status. Even before that reveal it was clear that you\u2019re the AH. You react explosively and without thought to the consequences, short or long term. \n\nI feel terrible for your kid. He\u2019s going to need years of therapy to unpack that damage you\u2019ve done. Because lbh, this isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve reacted inappropriately to his behavior.", "The daughters got makeup and jewelry and he got socks and a watch. It\u2019s obvious they didn\u2019t put as much thought into his gifts as the girls.", "YTA. Yes because what 13 year old doesn\u2019t looove to get socks and a watch as a present. Oh that\u2019s right! Probably None of them do. \n\nAnd then add on that he has adhd and autism\u2026 \n\nLady you failed Hard as a parent. You owe him an apology, a ps5, a guitar and lessons.", "YTA yikes", "Wow this is terrible. YTA. I'm also on the spectrum and it's not unusual for us to make comments when something is unexpected. The routine was broken and he was probably excited but also confused because he didn't ask for those things. I did the same thing when I was little. It comes out like \"I didn't want this\" but what I was really thinking was \"you didn't have to get me these extra things, I'm happy with just the items I put on the list\". Your reaction was beyond extreme and you should figure out why. Was this really about his comment or were you embarrassed and overreacted because you didn't want to seem like a bad parent?\n\nEdit to add: Socks and a watch can be a sensory nightmare depending on the person, so I can see how that could be especially disappointing.", "YTA and remember that the way you react to situations is teaching him how to react in the future. Even if your son didn\u2019t have ADHD or ASD, it\u2019s normal for kids to be disappointed especially when they were expecting something else. You utilize that as an appropriate learning opportunity or pull them aside later to discuss the social cue. Kids make dumb comments all the time. You were so harsh and out of line. \n\nParents need to stop using Christmas gifts as a means of punishment.", "ok, 13 year old with autism and ADHD, acts kinda like a 9 year old, DIDNT LIKE that he got SOCKS for Christmas \n\nidk what you expected from him, also you gave away a ps5 that you saved up for so no one wins except the damn cousin\n\nhe wasn\u2019t nice but you weren\u2019t any better, in fact he had a more appropriate reaction than you did, you don\u2019t deserve and apology you should be the one giving the apology", "YTA was he rude, yes. Did he deserve punishment, yes but what you did was over the top and plain mean.", "It was good of you to explain it the way you did, but i think it would have been better to return the presents to the store instead of giving them to another kid right in front of him. That does sound a little too harsh.", "Omfgggg \n\nYTA\n\nHe's a literal child, you not only took his gifts, bit you've them to another child? \n\nHoly christ, I'm going to say it again.\n\nYTA \n\nFuck me", "YTA- do you even have to ask?

I don't think it's the mom, tone seems weird", "YTA.\n\nYes it was rude of him to make a comment like that in front of the gift givers.

And your son needs a better mother!", "I wonder if OP prepared him for the change in Christmas routine. I would have talked to my kids beforehand. \u201cRemember grandpa has been sick, we probably won\u2019t get $100 this year, let\u2019s all be grateful for what we do get and hope grandpa gets better soon.\u201d  I already give my kids a lesson on gratitude and how to act if they get a gift they don\u2019t like every holiday precisely because they\u2019ve done stuff like OP\u2019s kid before. \n\nThe kid was rude but OP way overreacted. I would have made my child apologize on the spot and moved on saving any additional consequences for later depending on how bad the comment was (the additional consequence probably being you can\u2019t play with your PS5 for X days, write a thank you card for every gift you received, something along those lines).\n\nYou don\u2019t go nuclear over something like this.", "And not just his gifts\u2026his switch and computer! That\u2019s quite a punishment for any kid.", "My brother and daughter are asd and ADHD. If you don't hold them accountable they won't ever learn. At this stage, his son doesn't care that he hurt someone's feelings or that he was rude. He only cares about getting his stuff. With autism most people don't care about their relationships with others as long as they get what they want. There's no societal pressure lingering in the back of their mind in these situations.", "All of this. Every bit of it.  You hit the nail right on the head.", "Not to mention, apparently no preparation for a known change in the routine.", "Literally, why is everyone fuckin shrieking?", "YTA", "I can't believe she's taken just about all of his other tech away given that tends to be a way neurodivergent people regulate when they're over stimulated or wound up (we're all neurodivergent but husband has ADHD and Autism and son has Autism). She's essentially set both of them up for a really horrible few weeks.", "He is autistic. Any type of change is difficult. By not preparing him to not get the $100 which is what he was expecting and looking forward to. I still over react and get angry after change when I\u2019m looking forward to stuff. Teaching him to respond differently would be more beneficial than responding with anger. He\u2019s just going to learn that anger is appropriate way to respond. \n\nAlso you had to save up for that for him which means it\u2019s likely not something you can get for the next holiday or anything for him. And that does not fit the crime. Taking things away temporarily would be one thing but giving both his gifts to someone else in front of him was uncalled for and YTA", "I'm sorry to ask but you don understand that routine can be a huge factor to this, right? And can cause meltdowns??? Please tell me you do", "So, you left your son thinking he only got socks and a watch for Christmas (gifts that most 13 year-olds would find disappointing), then punished him for acting disappointed.  His comment was rude for sure, and needed to be addressed, but you went nuclear on him.  If you let someone be disappointed because you are planning a nice surprise, sometimes they might actually express that disappointment!  This really sounds like a situation that called for a stern talking to, so he could understand what he did wrong, and maybe withholding a gift for a day or two, not completely ruining his Christmas.", "Shady Pines, Ma!", "Yup, this was all the more heinous when the neurodivergent side comes to light. I have ADHD, and especially as a kid, it can be hard to realise different social cues, and also considering he was expecting $100, it was probably a huge disappointment. Dopamine is a huge factor, as people with ADHD are rather deficient in that area, and missing out on dopamine you were expecting can be deeply upsetting.\n\nI've had problems with food because of this, because making the healthy choice is really hard for me, and will result in considerably less happiness. I'm not saying his outburst was right, but a little bit more understanding on his side should be granted. Especially because he probably already would feel guilt over it, given time. For example, when I was around his age, I was really upset, and argued, stamped my foot, etc. about my parents not buying me a particular hoodie. This was because I was so blinded by need, and I was incredibly bored and my mood was so low, I needed SOMETHING. and after it being bought for me, there was brief dopamine before the guilt settled, and I spent the rest of the afternoon hating myself for being so cruel.\n\nAlso again, tearing something away from an ADHD kid before they even got it, something they wanted for years, is so dopamine crushing, and as someone who has had depressive episodes over similar, but slightly smaller things, this has to have absolutely crushed him. On Christmas day too.", "Lol this.\n\nI was kind of on the fence til the ADHD and ASD comment.\n\nNow its big fat YTA.\n\nMoreover, terrible parenting.", "This. She went too far. Son was rude, but what she did was absolute overkill.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if they have that though. He needed to learn a lesson. I swear y\u2019all care too much when it comes to that. She didn\u2019t even need to say and you would\u2019ve agreed with her punishment", "OP should hold her son accountable. But she overdid it so much. He had no chance to do better or learn anything of it. He did not get a warning or a lesson about kindness. He got absolute nuclear overkill.", "Wow... mom of the year huh?", "You were not courteous or respectful to him. Major A. Seriously, that sounds very traumatic for him. Your poor son.", "Your sister even said it was weird you did that", "Question, do you use corporal punishment with your son?", "You should reflect on where your son gets his temper and lack of control from. He was emotionally charged and reacted poorly, you became emotionally charged and acted poorly. Pot meet kettle. \n\nYou owe him your reflection and apology, and he deserves his gifts back. The punishment did not fit the crime- you escalated it, in front of everyone, because you were absolutely embarrassed. Could he have been emotional about his grandfather being in the hospital? Could he have been irritated by getting grown up boring gifts that made him feel unseen? Could he have been surging with hormones and unable to emotionally regulate? Could he have been unable to emotionally regulate due to his ADHD or ASD? You retaliated because of your embarrassment. Tell me, why didn\u2019t act respectfully in front of others in your home? YTA.", "Dude, I get it but it's literally part of being human and growing up. You cant expect perfection all because it's \"your house\" I do get it tho. He needed something because that should not be enabled.", "You could have talked to him before you went nuclear? He's autistic. Tell him what he said was rude. That there are more presents and he needs to apologize. What you did was outright cruel", "Sounds like neurodivergence isn't either.", "Umm FUCK NO. I have ADHD, I know other people with ADHD, we are NOT incapable of being polite AT ALL. ADHD isn\u2019t an excuse to be ungrateful and an ass. Can some of us be impulsive asf, yes, but to say we\u2019re incapable of being polite is just WRONG.\n\nI\u2019m convinced the people bringing up his ADHD as an excuse don\u2019t have it, don\u2019t know anyone with it, and taking your information from tik tok. That is one of the most ignorant statements I\u2019ve ever seen in my life", "It causes trauma.

I just cannot understand that you would hurt your child so much to teach a lesson.\n My daughter has a friend whose parents do exactly the same shit as you do. All other parents think that they are terrible and abusive parents. Their kids hate them from the bottom of their hearts, btw.", "I do think that the presents should have been withheld and not completely given away but kids with autism need big wake up calls a lot of the time. They need repeated repercussions. My brother would get grounded from his laptop at this same age and he literally broke his laptop trying to get a lock off of it. He was always trying to get around punishments and didn't even try to hide it as long as he got his stuff, even if he only got his stuff for a few minutes.", "That's the most ignorant statement you've ever seen? You must be blessed then that you have very few really ignorant people around you.\n\nMy daughter's best friend is autistic. He's weird at times and sometimes says really inconsiderate stuff. Sometimes rude, sometimes very overstepping. Normally we TELL him it's not ok and why, and normally he then apologizes. That would have been the way to go for OP.", "I feel like an unspoken issue here is that watches can no longer be the equivalent of the type of cheaper costume jewelry that might have been true even 10 years ago. Watches that people want are either significantly more expensive than $100 analog statement pieces OR significantly more expensive than $100 tech toys. If aunt and grandmother found a watch that was cheaper than given him $100 in 2023, that watch was useless to the son. The socks compounded the problem: Makeup is inherently fun whereas socks can only be kind of fun is mimicking a particular style.\n\nLike, aunt and grandmother really aged themselves with these gifts.", "Not only are YTA...you KNOW YTA. The fact that you saved the last paragraph to show he not only has ADHD but is autistic as well, YTA, YTA, YTA.

I don't know what you expected from this but you're gonna get what you definitely didn't", "YTA- I agree what he said was inappropriate and rude, but giving all of his presents away and then taking away the rest of his electronics was going overboard. You could have just sent him to his room and went to talk to him privately about his behavior. That's what most parents would have done in this situation. Instead, you not only embarrassed him in front of everybody, but you have also traumatized him as well.  You should get his presents back and apologize to him and explain how wrong you were to do that to him. And then, you hope and pray he forgives you and that maybe some of the damage you have inflicted has been fixed. But, I honestly doubt it.

If he always gets $100 and this time he was not and you knew that ahead of time then you messed up by not telling him ahead of time. Now add to this your son's adhd and your son is a mess and it's your fault. You should be ashamed of yourself. It is your job as a parent to make sure you set your child up for success.

It most definitely sets back progress when a parent does something like this. It is a \\*huge\\* overreaction. Consider what didn't go as expected: he didn't get comparable small gifts, he's used to getting $100 and even if he was told ahead of time, it's still something different happening on a special/emotionally charged/overstimulating/exciting/possibly stressful day. But then he gets another twist; on a day that is associated with children being given gifts, he gets the opposite. I'm really curious about how long OP waited until she went to lecture him (because let's call a spade a spade). Had he actually calmed down? Was he ready for that conversation or was she just trying to assert her dominance? And goodness gracious, losing preferred items and activities for a month after being rude is NOT naturalistic, aside from being another overreaction. If you want a consequence to actually work, it needs to make sense and be connected. A snotty comment? Being pulled aside and having someone explain why it's not ok and that an apology is warranted makes logical sense. These consequences that OP is putting in place seem to be more about her embarrassment more than anything else and that is a HER issue. And now that she's taken away SO much and so many BIG things, I bet she's going to struggle with this upcoming month, complaining about how he isn't motivated to do what she wants, and won't do as he's told, yadda yadda. Remember, the only behavior you can change is your own. You can promote and shape behavior in others, but OP didn't do that here.  \n\nAnd honestly, this is just plain mean.

How can you NOT see that you're totally overreacting? SMH", "YTA. Don\u2019t even need to elaborate.

That OP's son is also special needs makes the lack of preparation practically neglectful.\n\nI feel for this kid, he is a young teen and they always have problems managing strong emotions, and then on top of that he is neurodivergent - so this situation was absolutely a set up for him to fail. Then the horrendous punishment of losing his other presents, after an outburst he likely felt had no control over. It kinda sounds like OP resents her son for being a special needs teenager, something he definitely can't control. OP - YTA, just so much!", "Not agreeing with her overreaction here but the makeup vs socks is probably because a PS5 is WAY MORE EXPENSIVE Then a Kindle.", "I agree about the wake up call. Yet, scaring a child for life is not the way to go. Maybe the OP was just fed up with years of trying to raise a difficult child.", "Dude. The person you responded to literally said that they were NOT saying that people with adhd or autism  are incapable of being polite\u2026", "That's probably it but this isn't scarring.

Where exactly did I spew nonsense? \n\nWhen I told about my daughter's friend I referred to his autism and with that to OP's post. \n\nYou don't know me.

My daughter is nonverbal though. I'm telling you that my parents not following through with repercussions and consequences is why my brother still lives at home at the age of 30. Dude has an incredibly high IQ and is social enough for a friend group but he doesn't care enough about how he is perceived, otherwise he would work towards being independent. A lot of autistic people don't care about how they look as long as they get what they want. It's their benefit to fix that where when they act out like OPs son, you take away the things they want. Then they learn that if they don't act right, they don't get what they want. Autism has a lot of lack of emotional regulation and a lack of impulse control. They don't just suddenly learn these things on their own and explaining social rules doesn't work because they don't give a fuck about social rules. The only thing that works is when it directly effects them. \n\nNow I'm not speaking for everyone with autism. This wouldn't work on my daughter because she doesn't understand cause and effect. Honestly if she said something awful everyone would celebrate her saying words. So it's a case by case situation.", "I understand very well what you are trying to tell me. I work as a teacher, for adults and for kids. I worked with kids with ADHD and autism and also other illnesses and disorders. I absolutely agree with you on the boundaries. My daughter's best friend is autistic and he often does or says weird and hurtful stuff. His parents don't interfere too much, as they think he has to go his path in the world.\nBoundaries are necessary and needed and often not given. \n\nMy point was not about that. My point was that it is absolute overkill and cruel to punish a kid like that on Christmas. That's not a wake-up call but will only drive a wedge between him and his mother. She could have taken the stuff away for some days, for example. She did not even give him the chance to do better or apologize. It took OP years to save for that stuff, so it's gone for the next years, and he cannot redeem himself. So there's no incentive to behave better. She took away the motivation to do better. That's what I meant.", "Yeah I'd agree she should have kept it from him for like a month. I have to agree with everything you're saying.", "Omg that poor kid. YTA you\u2019re a monster wtf", "YTA x 1000\n\nYou totally over reacted to a rude comment.

I'd 1,000% understand DELAYING those gifts from them under the narrative of,\"You weren't grateful. So Santa's coming late on this one.\" But to outright give their gifts to some other kid right in front of them is just cruel.\n\nIf this wasn't a child on the spectrum, it'd come off as some snotty pre-teen who needs to be taught a lesson.

Otherwise, suffer the consequences of your child actually hating you for this.", "YTA, you could've give him presents after he apologized. But now he hates you AND his cousin!

A 13 year old can be insensitive with his comments sometimes, putting also in consideration that he is autistic and has ADHD. I personally think you could have handled this situation more gracefully as his mother and given him the presents. After the exchange was done you could have taken him aside and explained why his comment was rude and ask him to apologise for what he said.

Thankfully I have grown from that. \n\nThe actual thing I think your lightly an AH for? The knee jerk reaction. Learn to take a moment when you kid says something you don\u2019t like and find the best way to address it. What would\u2019ve been a better way was to take the items to your room pulled the kid aside asked him why he felt the need to say that and then ask him how he thinks your sister felt hearing that. Unfortunately empathy has to be learned for some of us. The best way I found for me is to put myself in the situation or in the persons shoes of who I may have hurt. Afterwards you could\u2019ve told him that it was wrong but used the items you were going to give him in a type of redeeming reward system to understand that you will hurt people it\u2019s what you do afterwards that matters and sometimes just sometimes it can work out for you too.", "YTA. That was draconian. One temper tantrum and he lost everything. What are you giving up for your temper tantrum?\n\nI would have let him have his desired gifts but then told him that, because of his behavior, he wouldn't get to play with the PS5 for a month instead. That would have sent the message. You sent the message that any screw up on his part means his parent will take everything away. He will not be able to trust you with anything.

Over a couple sentences??? While their grandfather is in the hospital??? With someone\u2019s who\u2019s brain is not properly equipped to manage change and impulse? Wtf?", "Seriously. If I witnessed this, I would absolutely think that the son\u2019s behavior was a direct reflection of how OP treats him."]}
