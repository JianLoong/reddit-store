It IS weird to spy on her kids, but she has every right to place cameras in her own house.  Since they are home ALL the time, she feels that she needs to keep an eye on her kids.  That is her prerogative, but if her kids ever figure it out, it will definitely hurt their relationship.", "you are NTA for telling your coworker that her weird behaviour is super weird..", "YTA for giving your opinion if she didn't ask for it. I do see the reasoning as to why she has the cameras since they're in online school, but I do think it's odd.", "NTA. She brought it up. It is totally weird and you said it. Normally I\u2019d say keep parenting advice to yourself, but spying on your kids with cameras and w/o their consent - especially 15 and 17 - is inappropriate", "NTA \n\nIf she didn't want an opinion, she shouldn't have mentioned it first.", "Look, the cornerstone of society is calling them out when they do fucked up things.

Never give unsolicited parenting advice.", "YTA\n\nIts her house and her kids.", "NTA. It *is* really creepy and weird. Popping out a kid does not automatically mean you know best and having an attitude like that is a strong indicator that you're dead wrong about a lot of things concerning raising children. Hopefully her kids find the cameras before they are hacked and other people start spying on her unaware teens as well.", "NTA. If she doesn't want people's opinions on it then she should learn to keep it to herself. \n\nIt is also really inappropriate given her kids' ages and if/when they find out it is going to break trust in their relationship.", "INFO: where in the house are the cameras? That can really change things.", "NTA. She got upset because she knows you\u2019re right. It\u2019s creepy to spy on kids that age and they should at least know that they are being watched", "NTA. Gill discusses her personal life at work. If she doesn't want anybody commenting on her personal life she should keep it to herself. However, I don't think it's creepy if those hidden cameras are in common areas such as the kitchen or living room. Her kids are teenagers and she might have a valid reason. Maybe her kids do get in trouble or they lie to her. You don't know.", "NTA, she brought it up in conversation. If she doesn't want people offering opinions on her personal life, don't bring it up in conversations, especially at work.", "NTA, Inadvertently, when you\u2019re talking about your personal life to someone you\u2019re asking for/opening yourself up to responses/opinions. If she had agreed with her coworker it would have been a completely different situation but the fact that she didn\u2019t is specifically what caused the issue. If you don\u2019t want unwanted opinions don\u2019t talk to people. Period. Do I think it\u2019s a bit creepy? Yes. Do I understand why she does it? Also yes. As another user commented though, where the cameras are located would change my opinion on things. Any cameras in the bathrooms or bedrooms would be a strict no and violation of boundaries/privacy. Children/teenagers are entitled to their own private safe space. I also feel if you\u2019re recording/taping anyone they have a right to know about it.", "YTA. Not everything needs an opinion. Keep yours to yourself unless it is hurting or endangering someone or unless it is asked for.", "Yeah, it is weird she has hidden cameras to spy on her kids, if she doesn't trust them, them she should find a job that allows her to work from home. But, she didn't ask your opinion either.", "YTA", "NTA. And you were right, she is acting creepy.", "OP didn\u2019t give parenting advice. They said it was creepy and weird after their coworker told them the information unprompted. They didn\u2019t say what the coworker should or shouldn\u2019t do, they just responded. NTA", "Same could be said for the woman who just decided to tell OP how she treats her kids. OP never asked.", "What do you think shaming something implies? How do you know they don\u2019t have behavioral issues? Some kids can\u2019t be trusted.", "Then send them to school. A hidden camera is unethical", "With the pandemics of COVID and school shootings I can emphasize with a parent thinking schools are not the best option.", "Neither is spying on your children.", "It would be a lot better if she told them. Teenage monitor.", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s super weird and creepy. Another version of the icky controlling parent behaviour that includes looking for diaries and demanding to look through phones", "As a person who grew up wondering whether my dad and stepmom had hidden cameras, thank you for giving appropriate feedback about how unhealthy and creepy doing such a thing is. It's a very helpless feeling wondering whether someone is watching you every moment of your life. NTA.", "NTA. I have kids and this is weird and creepy. Idc you are crossing a line and your kids will never trust you when they get older or even now. Want to be alone when they get older? Yeah get cameras see how that works out for you. That\u2019s a prison not a home.  My sons father did this and let\u2019s just say they don\u2019t really speak that much any longer. That\u2019s controlling behavior. There is being a parent and there\u2019s being an absolute stalker. Kids have been fine without all this technology to find them for decades. Wtf is wrong with half these comments.? Why so many YTA? Pffffft..You could easily say the same thing about the person telling OP about all of this. \nI didn\u2019t ask for your fucking life story either so when you\u2019re gonna tell me, I\u2019m obviously gonna say that\u2019s fucking creepy.  She obviously said it so that she would get a reaction. Some of you need to get off your high horse and idk maybe not have kids if you just want to live out some fucked up weird controlling fantasy. Keep it to yourself if you don\u2019t want anyone telling you that your insane.", "NTA\n\nIf she doesn't want to hear other people's opinion about how she raises her children, she shouldn't talk about it. So as long as you just stated your opinion and didn't actually start lecturing her or bringing it up again and again, you did nothing wrong.\n\nI also agree that putting up hidden cameras to watch her children is absolutely weird, creepy and a big breach of trust. Unless there is an actual reason for it, like the kids having a history of destroying things, hiding stuff, planning bad pranks or whatever else may come to mind.", "NTA if she didn't want your opinion she shouldn't share personal info. Im a parent and you are right that is some creepy shit. She could just you know call her kids to see what they are up to. Should be intereating when eventually those kids discover the cameras.", "NTA", "NTA She is being a creepy wierdo and I think you should tell everyone about it.", "No you called out creepy bullshit, that's toxic", "NTA. My dad has a camera in the living room but it's to watch the dogs when he's at work and for me to interact with him and the dogs and my brother because I live across the world from them, and also we all know its there. Its deeply weird to have a camera if no one else knows about it. If her kids are 15 and 17 and she can't trust them to not have 24/7  supervision then she obviously don't know as much about how to be a good mom as she thinks she does.", "NTA. You\u2019re right. Also, depending on where the hidden cameras are, she may have in her possession some footage of her underage kids that\u2019s illegal. Parenting doesn\u2019t give someone the right to violate boundaries. The fact that she thought to tell you makes me think your co-worker finds the hidden cameras entertaining or something. Weird. Creepy. You are not in the wrong.", "NTA", "Nta damn if those kids ever find out they\u2019re not gonna talk to her anymore", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf she is fine to tell you about it, you are fine to comment on it.", "YTA. Her kid, her rules.", "The difference between stalking and surveillance is you are paid by someone to be doing surveillance...   I know laws are different in your own house;  however.  If I am correct, depending on WHERE she put the cameras; aka their bedrooms, that isn't okay.  You have a reasonable expectation of privacy in your own bedroom.\n\nAlso;  if they are changing on camera; that could be problematic for her. \n\nI am not a lawyer.  This is not legal advice.", "Bold of you to think they have any sort of good relationship to their mother already, i doubt this is the first instance of her acting controlling.", "It\u2019s creepy and messed up regardless of where they are.", "Safe to assume they're in the bathrooms too. If creeps who spy on their kids don't want to be thought of as perverts, they shouldn't spy on their kids.", "Being technically allowed to do something doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re right to do it. Most of the asshole things posted on here are perfectly legal and \u2018allowed\u2019.", "And? That doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not an asshole for how she treats her kids in her house.", "There's that woman who chained her kids and they were eating their poo to survive. Her kids, her rules right? \n\n*yeah*\ud83d\ude44", "One camera facing them when they're supposed to be doing school work, during school hours is weird but squeaks in under \"reasonable\". \n\nAnywhere else is a ridiculous invasion of privacy, and in places like bathrooms and bedrooms is illegal and all sorts of messed up for their mom to be watching.", "That is literally a completely different thing. I would personally never put cameras specifically to watch my kids (deffo for general security), but that\u2019s a stretch to say monitoring your kids at home is the same as being a criminal and choosing to neglect, starve, and abuse them.", "NTA. It is creepy and weird and I wonder what she thinks will happen when the kids find out? Also, if any of those secret cameras are in the toilet, she may in fact be breaking the law.", "If any of those cameras are in the toilet, she may actually be breaking the law though."]}
