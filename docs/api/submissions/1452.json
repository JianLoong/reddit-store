It IS weird to spy on her kids, but she has every right to place cameras in her own house.  Since they are home ALL the time, she feels that she needs to keep an eye on her kids.  That is her prerogative, but if her kids ever figure it out, it will definitely hurt their relationship.", "you are NTA for telling your coworker that her weird behaviour is super weird..", "YTA for giving your opinion if she didn't ask for it. I do see the reasoning as to why she has the cameras since they're in online school, but I do think it's odd.", "NTA. She brought it up. It is totally weird and you said it. Normally I\u2019d say keep parenting advice to yourself, but spying on your kids with cameras and w/o their consent - especially 15 and 17 - is inappropriate", "NTA \n\nIf she didn't want an opinion, she shouldn't have mentioned it first.", "Look, the cornerstone of society is calling them out when they do fucked up things.

Never give unsolicited parenting advice.", "YTA\n\nIts her house and her kids.", "NTA. It *is* really creepy and weird. Popping out a kid does not automatically mean you know best and having an attitude like that is a strong indicator that you're dead wrong about a lot of things concerning raising children. Hopefully her kids find the cameras before they are hacked and other people start spying on her unaware teens as well.", "NTA. If she doesn't want people's opinions on it then she should learn to keep it to herself. \n\nIt is also really inappropriate given her kids' ages and if/when they find out it is going to break trust in their relationship.", "INFO: where in the house are the cameras? That can really change things.", "NTA. She got upset because she knows you\u2019re right. It\u2019s creepy to spy on kids that age and they should at least know that they are being watched", "NTA. Gill discusses her personal life at work. If she doesn't want anybody commenting on her personal life she should keep it to herself. However, I don't think it's creepy if those hidden cameras are in common areas such as the kitchen or living room. Her kids are teenagers and she might have a valid reason. Maybe her kids do get in trouble or they lie to her. You don't know.", "NTA, she brought it up in conversation. If she doesn't want people offering opinions on her personal life, don't bring it up in conversations, especially at work.", "NTA, Inadvertently, when you\u2019re talking about your personal life to someone you\u2019re asking for/opening yourself up to responses/opinions. If she had agreed with her coworker it would have been a completely different situation but the fact that she didn\u2019t is specifically what caused the issue. If you don\u2019t want unwanted opinions don\u2019t talk to people. Period. Do I think it\u2019s a bit creepy? Yes. Do I understand why she does it? Also yes. As another user commented though, where the cameras are located would change my opinion on things. Any cameras in the bathrooms or bedrooms would be a strict no and violation of boundaries/privacy. Children/teenagers are entitled to their own private safe space. I also feel if you\u2019re recording/taping anyone they have a right to know about it.", "YTA. Not everything needs an opinion. Keep yours to yourself unless it is hurting or endangering someone or unless it is asked for.", "Yeah, it is weird she has hidden cameras to spy on her kids, if she doesn't trust them, them she should find a job that allows her to work from home. But, she didn't ask your opinion either.", "YTA", "NTA. And you were right, she is acting creepy.", "OP didn\u2019t give parenting advice. They said it was creepy and weird after their coworker told them the information unprompted. They didn\u2019t say what the coworker should or shouldn\u2019t do, they just responded. NTA", "Same could be said for the woman who just decided to tell OP how she treats her kids. OP never asked.", "What do you think shaming something implies? How do you know they don\u2019t have behavioral issues? Some kids can\u2019t be trusted.", "Then send them to school. A hidden camera is unethical", "With the pandemics of COVID and school shootings I can emphasize with a parent thinking schools are not the best option.", "Neither is spying on your children.", "It would be a lot better if she told them.
