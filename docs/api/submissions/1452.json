It IS weird to spy on her kids, but she has every right to place cameras in her own house.  Since they are home ALL the time, she feels that she needs to keep an eye on her kids.  That is her prerogative, but if her kids ever figure it out, it will definitely hurt their relationship.", "you are NTA for telling your coworker that her weird behaviour is super weird..", "YTA for giving your opinion if she didn't ask for it. I do see the reasoning as to why she has the cameras since they're in online school, but I do think it's odd.", "NTA. She brought it up. It is totally weird and you said it. Normally I\u2019d say keep parenting advice to yourself, but spying on your kids with cameras and w/o their consent - especially 15 and 17 - is inappropriate", "NTA \n\nIf she didn't want an opinion, she shouldn't have mentioned it first.", "Look, the cornerstone of society is calling them out when they do fucked up things.

Never give unsolicited parenting advice.", "YTA\n\nIts her house and her kids.", "NTA. It *is* really creepy and weird. Popping out a kid does not automatically mean you know best and having an attitude like that is a strong indicator that you're dead wrong about a lot of things concerning raising children. Hopefully her kids find the cameras before they are hacked and other people start spying on her unaware teens as well.", "NTA. If she doesn't want people's opinions on it then she should learn to keep it to herself. \n\nIt is also really inappropriate given her kids' ages and if/when they find out it is going to break trust in their relationship."]}
