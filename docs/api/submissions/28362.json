Right now, your cousin isn't listening to you about this guy's character, so yeah, you're resorting to using your money. It is what it is. You're allowed to do so. I genuinely don't think that makes you an AH.\n\nShe's not being manipulated with money because a wedding isn't a necessity. The last wedding you paid for, the grooms parents helped.", "You do you my man, why do you need an excuse or someone to assure you that you are doing the right thing, the right thing to do with your money, is what feels right to you.", "NTA\n\nHer bf disrespected and insulted you and has no plans for the future.\n\nShe expects and assumes that you would want to help pay for a wedding to someone who can't  be respectful.", "You should have told her that you would be happy to get together with his parents and split the cost like you did when her sister got married", "NTA but seriously who pays for someone else's wedding? If my daughter pulls that line on me she's getting monopoly money.", "I don't think you're necessarily playing favourites here, but from her perspective, you do. Try to have another conversation with her. There is not much you can do to make her see your point. Giving ultimatums like that won't magically make her dump that guy, she'll push back even harder on her decision just to prove you wrong, and you'll just push her away. If I were you, I'd offer the same amount of money as you gave for her sister's wedding so no one else can accuse you of playing favourites. But first you need to have that talk and express your concerns about what kind of person she wants to marry, i.e. cheater, rude, no aspirations of improving his/their living situation, etc. My point is, you can't help someone who doesn't want your help even if you have their best interest at heart, but if things go sideways, she will need her family to be there for her. \nI'm going with NTA because at the end of the day, it's your money, and you'll have to face the fallout, be it comforting her after she realises the mistake she made or her going NC with you.", ">he cheated on her\n\nThat alone is enough reason to decline.  NTA.", "Yta\n\nAll you had to do was give her the same treatment as her sister, but instead you decided to exert control over the situation to make it more beneficial for yourself.", "\"You are  just not paying.\"   \n\nThis is correct and perfect. That's it; that's all. You do whatever you want. I'm just not paying.", "[removed]", "Cheated, barely works, no intention of improving himself for their future and disrespectful of OPs culture and possibly just disrespectful to OP in general. \n\nTell me why exactly OP should be paying for that wedding.

Non disclosure agreement. \ud83d\ude0b", "if SHE is fine with the bf cheating, it's not OP's place to stand against that.  the whole 'doesn't have a better job' sounds pretty snobby to me.", "This is a very thoughtful approach. When you marry the wrong guy (I have too!), you may be presented some flags, but don\u2019t know how to read them or are too idealistic or pressured and think you can handle it. Doesn\u2019t matter if your ID says you are an adult. Maybe you\u2019ve been through some stuff and didn\u2019t yet learn some things yet. With some empathy and an honest talk, maybe she can explore a bit why she is going forward with this. Don\u2019t assume she knows what she is doing, OP.", "OP INFO: What do you mean he disrespects your Eastern European Heritage?   \n\n\nI feel like that in combination with the 'hood' mentality comment are not good signs...", "Being undemocratic, paternalistic, letting priest abuse kids with no consequences or making ridiculous \"LGBT-free zone\" signs isn't a culture but a politics. Don't mix these things.   \nI'm from Eastern Europe and I wholeheartedly hate all these issues you wrote about. It's not my culture. My culture is the music, art, Christmas traditions and favourite dishes. Not some greedy AH politics.", "On the Scary Mommy True Confessions, a woman told how her grandma took secretly gave her a check for $10,000 before her wedding day.\n\nGrandma said, \"Keep this for your own money.

Just that he is a disrespectful cheater who only has part time employment & no plans for his future.", "Being cheated on is **NOT** Lisa\u2019s fault.", "If Lisa is smart, she needs a PreNup as well. :-P", "It's his money though? He can do whatever he wants, or doesn't want, with it.", "Sure, but if she is going to say \"he insulted my heritage\" while also saying \"hood mentality,\" it makes op look bad. Hood mentality, in my experience, is normally a racial dig at First Nations and poc. Wouldn't this be a direct insult to his culture?", "You are right. When thinking about it some more, the disrespectful behavior would tip the scales for me all right.\n\nI stand corrected and I am changing my opinion to NTA.", "And then she broke up with him, I hope?", "I remember seeing a post about a similar situation but it was money for a downpayment for a house because the wedding had already been paid for by the parents and he took the money to Vegas for his bachelors and lost it all. Point being it absolutely does happen", "My Dad (who is great) always told me that he raised me to be independent so when I got married it was because I loved the man and wanted to be married. Not because I needed a man to keep me.", "Understandable. I\u2019m assuming he isn\u2019t budgeting well enough to live within his means either.

Staying with him despite the red flags is her prerogative and decision though.", "Op doesn't live in america. So using the wrong words is not out of realm of possibility, especially since nowadays everyone is sensitive and everything is insulting. Even if the guy is black, who cares?? He cheated and he doesn't have a job. Strange as it might be, regardless of his race he can still be called out for his actions. People using the race card to defend someone doing something wrong has become the norm. I know it worked that time with oj simpson, but let's give it a rest.", "Which is why he can't pay for a wedding.", "Yet nobody thinks such bad shit about women who work part time- crazy.", "At no point did I use the race card to defend anything he did or claim he wasn't an ass, he is totally an ass. I'm saying OP didn't need to include the insulting her heritage while using a term that is considered as an insult in parts of the world to describe him.", ">thug  \n/\u03b8\u028c\u0261/  \nnoun  \n1.  \na violent, aggressive person, especially one who is a criminal.  \n\"he was attacked by a gang of thugs\"  \n2.  \nHISTORICAL  \na member of a group or organization of robbers and assassins in India who waylaid and strangled their victims, usually travellers, and stole their belongings.

OP states that as a conclusion but doesn\u2019t actually give any examples nor have they commented to elaborate, which is why I voted info.", "What factual information did op give to make you think op is the one that it's racist towards mj?? I get that you wanted to play the race card, but even if the guy is black, it's not what drove op to not agree with him.", "I said he could be TA and asked for info. I admit that I found the phrase \u201cHood mentality\u201d troubling, which is why I asked for info. Why do you assume MJ is black? It\u2019s the phrase \u201chood mentality\u201d isn\u2019t it?? so yeah, that\u2019s where my brain went and that\u2019s where your brain went, which is why I asked for info. The fact that I put the question out there and asked for info on which to make a judgment, and you just assumed that the black guy was racist against the white guy is interesting."]}
