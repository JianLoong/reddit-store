You may not have seen it that way, but if you\u2019ve been doing this for 9 years then your friend probably does. \n\nRegardless, your not the AH. I think there may just be a misunderstanding here.", "NTA. Grief isn't linear, so I understand that this time of year hurts her even nine years later. However, she doesn't get to hold your time and energy hostage. I'm sorry she's hurting, but lashing out at others won't help her feel better.", "NTA - I feel bad for people who lose someone around the holidays, but to turn every holiday into a memorial gathering for years to come isn't healthy. You've been there every year for the last 8 out of 9 years - that's more than a lot of people would've done. It's not fair for her to lash out at you for wanting to enjoy the holiday with your friends. Hopefully, she comes to realize that when she calms down a bit.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m going to say something harsh. People\u2019s families die. And the anniversaries can be difficult. But that\u2019s true for everyone you have ever met. She isn\u2019t special. \n\nIt\u2019s been nine years, you\u2019ve been a great friend for nine years.

Frankly, it would probably be healthy for her to do something other than stay at home. \n\nThe closest thing to becoming by a jerk here is apologizing for something you shouldn\u2019t be sorry about", "NTA. Big shoutout to you for being with her 9 years during that time. But I agree at one point the grieving needs to stop and you should be allowed to live.", "NTA - it's your life, if you want to spend new year's out then that's your prerogative", "NTA - You've been there for her for years. It's totally fine if you do something different. She's not alone or being abandoned. You offered support for the next day if she really needed it. There's nothing wrong with you having fun.", "NTA. The grief she went through is very sad but it doesn't make her the center of the Universe, nor does it mean that nobody she knows is ever allowed to celebrate New Year's.", "NTA, based on the title I was expecting to call you TA. If it was the first anniversary/happened within the past year, I\u2019d get it. But it\u2019s been 9 years.

You\u2019ve been supporting her for years. She can\u2019t expect you or anyone else she knows to never celebrate NYE again.

You are right how long are you supposed to do this for? You have your own life to live. Her grieving and not wanting to go out on this day is totally reasonable. But getting mad because a friend doesn't want to intrude on a families day of grieving for their member seems weird.", "NTA. If she is still grieving, that's fine but she can't expect others to mope around because she is. I know misery loves company, but it doesn't make anyone insensitive for wanting to go live their lives on a holiday. Go have fun. If she refuses the invite, that's up to her.", "NTA, tbh it seems a bit unhealthy to mourn someone for almost 10 years, as if the duel is not over.

She needs to understand that the world doesn't stop turning when we lose someone and, even though it may still bring us down, we can't expect everyone around us to grieve their days away, too.", "NTA. You have done more than enough and your friend will soon realize it\u2019s unfair to expect you to continue to attend this grisly annual family gathering.", "NTA\n\nNine years is a LONG time.  If you feel that it's time to move on, then so be it.  Your friend cannot hold someone hostage to a holiday for 9+ years...", "NTA. \n\nShe needs to grieve. And that\u2019s ok. But he wasn\u2019t your dad. It\u2019s not your responsibility to be there. \n\nIt is very kind of you that you did that for the last nine years. You\u2019re a good friends, and going out on New Years doesn\u2019t make you any less of a good friend. If she can\u2019t handle that then that\u2019s on her.", "NTA, you're allowed to have fun and do your own thing. I feel for your friend, even if it's been 9 years, grief is never a one and done process. However, it's inappropriate for her to react that way when people want to go out on New Years. You have been there for her. Life will continue, with or without us in it. I hope she eventually finds some form of peace about it. Losing a parent is hard, especially when your young.", "NTA - it's rude of her to expect her friend group to revolve their lives around her grieving. This is something she needs to work out with a therapist or her family. \n\nYou should not feel sorry for wanting to celebrate the new years with your friends doing something other than mourning someone who died 9 years ago.", "NTA you have spent every year grieving with her family since you were 14? Honestly if I was your mom I would have stepped in and given you an excuse to back out a long time ago (like our family was doing something..anything) This is unfair of her to ask so many years later esp that she is now older and should have greater perspective. \nI am sorry for the family loss but I lost my dad unexpectedly (older but still) and I KNOW he would not want us spending the night like that for close to a decade. \nSo NTA. And she should not be doing it either. Have fun. Lift a glass to dad and live your life.", "NTA", "NTA. 9 years is a long time for you to participate in this ritual. It might make sense the first year, and big anniversaries after that: 10 years, 20 years etc. \n\nNo, it's ok for you to nope on this. She's still grieving, and you have been understanding about that. I'm really sorry for her, it must be difficult. But you aren't required to carry on with this, she doesn't get exclusive rights to that day.", "**if she needs me then she can just text me and I\u2019ll try do my best to help.** \n\nIf you are trying to help after 9 years, therapy is best for her.", "Next week will be the 5th anniversary of my dad's death from glioblastoma (brain cancer), so I say this with some experience: NTA.  At all.  Your friend is borderline TA, though.\n\nShe has to find a better way to grieve, which is why I say borderline.  If she doesn't want to get help for her coping then she's fully TA.  You're being rational here, not everyone can put their lives on hold and sit Shiva for the rest of their lives.  She respect his memory without you, and maybe doing so will help her realize that she can't take her anger out on you or the rest of your friends group.  That's probably what's scaring her: the fear of moving on from her father's death and the reality that it'll be okay.\n\nEDIT: I have to say, if my best friend stayed home with me every January 5th, for the past five years, then I'd be so incredibly indebted to her.  \n\nThis is what my best friend did:   \n1) Was one of three people in my friends group who agreed to get a text when my dad died.    \n2) She left work within 10 minutes of said text message, drove with me downstate two hours and proceeded to spend the entire day with me and my family.   \n3) Paid for the heart-shaped urn that would contain my father's ashes.  \n4) Went to dinner with us and took a two hour long Uber ride back from where I'd driven us.\n\nI'd look so ungrateful if I were to then ask her to do the same thing every single year as some sort of continual tradition.", "NTA, the idea that your friend can just claim a day as a universal day of mourning because of her own situation forevermore is ridiculous. Especially a holiday.\n\nThe most your friend is entitled to is her to stay home NYE and not want to celebrate the day anymore.

I think it would have been better to approach her privately *before* agreeing to the night out and explaining what you explained. She must have felt shocked and let down to see you casually accept the invite without acknowledging that would mean you can't be there for her in a way she was probably counting on. \n\nIf your mutual friends are aware of her trauma and rituals around New Years eve then I think they were insensitive to suggest plans for a night out in a group chat with her in. They should have set up a separate group.

At 14 it will have been very raw and about her immediate loss. At 23 she may be just starting to realise that she's starting her career and maybe thinking about getting married or starting a family and she will never get to experience her dad being proud of those things, giving her advice on her job, telling her she's a beautiful bride or meeting his grandchildren. Her siblings have had the same losses and her mother will be doing all that alone rather than with her husband as she probably always imagined.\n\nYou've clearly been a great support to her. Maybe she really isn't coping and does need proper therapy, you haven't said much about how she copes in daily life and how often the bad days are. But maybe she and her family need time to remember and grieve the loss they are still experiencing.

They always appreciate it.\n\nHer trauma is just that, HER'S. No one else need put their life on hold because of it.\n\nNTA, and Happy New Year!", "Exactly. I'm not judging the friend for still being so deep in their grief that they lashed out. They are where they are. But the goal of healing is to get to the point where you can feel that feeling and calmly advocate for your needs instead of lashing out. \n\nThe friend COULD (not necessarily \"should\") have said \"you know, guys, this is a hard day for me and I can't do the going out thing yet, but I still want to feel included and supported. Can you come by my house first for the annual celebration of my dad's life, and we'll eat his favorite meal before you go out, so you're fed and ready to go?\"\n\nWhether or not the friend is ready for that level of maturity, the OP doesn't need to think there are only the two choices the friend says there are - do exactly what they've always done, or betray the friend."]}
