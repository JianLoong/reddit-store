Live your life. Go out and have fun.", "NTA you get to go out and have fun, you should have for many years before this", "NTA\n\nI wonder if your friend isn\u2019t mad that you\u2019re going out so much as they\u2019re mad because it feels like you are breaking a tradition. You may not have seen it that way, but if you\u2019ve been doing this for 9 years then your friend probably does. \n\nRegardless, your not the AH. I think there may just be a misunderstanding here.", "NTA. Grief isn't linear, so I understand that this time of year hurts her even nine years later. However, she doesn't get to hold your time and energy hostage. I'm sorry she's hurting, but lashing out at others won't help her feel better.", "NTA - I feel bad for people who lose someone around the holidays, but to turn every holiday into a memorial gathering for years to come isn't healthy. You've been there every year for the last 8 out of 9 years - that's more than a lot of people would've done. It's not fair for her to lash out at you for wanting to enjoy the holiday with your friends. Hopefully, she comes to realize that when she calms down a bit.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m going to say something harsh. People\u2019s families die. And the anniversaries can be difficult. But that\u2019s true for everyone you have ever met. She isn\u2019t special. \n\nIt\u2019s been nine years, you\u2019ve been a great friend for nine years. But you and your friend group should be able to go out partying without offending her. Frankly, it would probably be healthy for her to do something other than stay at home. \n\nThe closest thing to becoming by a jerk here is apologizing for something you shouldn\u2019t be sorry about", "NTA. Big shoutout to you for being with her 9 years during that time. But I agree at one point the grieving needs to stop and you should be allowed to live.", "NTA - it's your life, if you want to spend new year's out then that's your prerogative", "NTA - You've been there for her for years. It's totally fine if you do something different. She's not alone or being abandoned. You offered support for the next day if she really needed it. There's nothing wrong with you having fun.", "NTA. The grief she went through is very sad but it doesn't make her the center of the Universe, nor does it mean that nobody she knows is ever allowed to celebrate New Year's.", "NTA, based on the title I was expecting to call you TA. If it was the first anniversary/happened within the past year, I\u2019d get it. But it\u2019s been 9 years. It doesn\u2019t take away from her grief, but you do have to let those around you move on after a certain point.", "NTA. You had me at 9 years. She can be mad about it, but it doesn't make you wrong. You have gone far and beyond to support her. Go out and have fun, you have been a great friend for many years and will continue to be for other friends. She will come around, and if she doesn't, it's her loss.", "NTA you did this for nine years which shows what an excellent friend and person you\u2019ve been. I get their grief is probably still real and that there may be some feeling of breaking a tradition but reasonably you need to be able to move on at some point.", "NTA", "NTA. You\u2019ve been supporting her for years. She can\u2019t expect you or anyone else she knows to never celebrate NYE again. She needs to work this out with a therapist instead of taking it out on you. You didn\u2019t say anything wrong and don\u2019t need to apologize.\n\nShe\u2019s being controlling.", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019ve been a great friend giving up your new years for so long to help her get through the reminder of a horrible day. \n\nWhile loss is always hard and that day will probably always suck for her, it\u2019s selfish for her to expect you grieve with her every single year especially after 9 years. \n\nMaybe she would benefit from seeing a grief counselor.", "NTA,   \nSupporting her is all well and fine but her grief is her own. You are right how long are you supposed to do this for? You have your own life to live. Her grieving and not wanting to go out on this day is totally reasonable. But getting mad because a friend doesn't want to intrude on a families day of grieving for their member seems weird.", "NTA. If she is still grieving, that's fine but she can't expect others to mope around because she is. I know misery loves company, but it doesn't make anyone insensitive for wanting to go live their lives on a holiday. Go have fun. If she refuses the invite, that's up to her.", "NTA, tbh it seems a bit unhealthy to mourn someone for almost 10 years, as if the duel is not over. Even I didn't mourn my grandma, who literally raised me, for that long, and she died at a special day too (d\u00eda de la Candelaria, February 2nd) when I was around 16 (I'm currently 23).\n\nDon't tell your friend this yet, but she and her family need to let go the pain and create new (festive and happy) memories. Yes, remember him and honour him, but don't stop your celebration of a new year like that.", "NTA\n\nIn hindsight you probably could have used a different groupchat to organise your plans, then messaged her separately to say you think it's time you left that tradition for it to be just family.\n\nBut someone else suggested it then there's not much you can do about that. \n\nGo out and have fun before you get stuck doing that forever", "NTA - You have shown her 9 years of support.  She needs to understand that the world doesn't stop turning when we lose someone and, even though it may still bring us down, we can't expect everyone around us to grieve their days away, too.", "NTA. You have done more than enough and your friend will soon realize it\u2019s unfair to expect you to continue to attend this grisly annual family gathering.", "NTA\n\nNine years is a LONG time.  If you feel that it's time to move on, then so be it.  Your friend cannot hold someone hostage to a holiday for 9+ years...", "NTA. \n\nShe needs to grieve. And that\u2019s ok. But he wasn\u2019t your dad. It\u2019s not your responsibility to be there. \n\nIt is very kind of you that you did that for the last nine years. You\u2019re a good friends, and going out on New Years doesn\u2019t make you any less of a good friend. If she can\u2019t handle that then that\u2019s on her.", "NTA, you're allowed to have fun and do your own thing. I feel for your friend, even if it's been 9 years, grief is never a one and done process. However, it's inappropriate for her to react that way when people want to go out on New Years. You have been there for her. Life will continue, with or without us in it. I hope she eventually finds some form of peace about it. Losing a parent is hard, especially when your young.", "NTA - it's rude of her to expect her friend group to revolve their lives around her grieving. This is something she needs to work out with a therapist or her family. \n\nYou should not feel sorry for wanting to celebrate the new years with your friends doing something other than mourning someone who died 9 years ago.", "NTA you have spent every year grieving with her family since you were 14? Honestly if I was your mom I would have stepped in and given you an excuse to back out a long time ago (like our family was doing something..anything) This is unfair of her to ask so many years later esp that she is now older and should have greater perspective. \nI am sorry for the family loss but I lost my dad unexpectedly (older but still) and I KNOW he would not want us spending the night like that for close to a decade. \nSo NTA. And she should not be doing it either. Have fun. Lift a glass to dad and live your life.", "NTA", "NTA. 9 years is a long time for you to participate in this ritual. It might make sense the first year, and big anniversaries after that: 10 years, 20 years etc. \n\nNo, it's ok for you to nope on this. She's still grieving, and you have been understanding about that. I'm really sorry for her, it must be difficult. But you aren't required to carry on with this, she doesn't get exclusive rights to that day.", "**if she needs me then she can just text me and I\u2019ll try do my best to help.** \n\nIf you are trying to help after 9 years, therapy is best for her.", "Next week will be the 5th anniversary of my dad's death from glioblastoma (brain cancer), so I say this with some experience: NTA.  At all.  Your friend is borderline TA, though.\n\nShe has to find a better way to grieve, which is why I say borderline.  If she doesn't want to get help for her coping then she's fully TA.  You're being rational here, not everyone can put their lives on hold and sit Shiva for the rest of their lives.  She respect his memory without you, and maybe doing so will help her realize that she can't take her anger out on you or the rest of your friends group.  That's probably what's scaring her: the fear of moving on from her father's death and the reality that it'll be okay.\n\nEDIT: I have to say, if my best friend stayed home with me every January 5th, for the past five years, then I'd be so incredibly indebted to her.  \n\nThis is what my best friend did:   \n1) Was one of three people in my friends group who agreed to get a text when my dad died.    \n2) She left work within 10 minutes of said text message, drove with me downstate two hours and proceeded to spend the entire day with me and my family.   \n3) Paid for the heart-shaped urn that would contain my father's ashes.  \n4) Went to dinner with us and took a two hour long Uber ride back from where I'd driven us.\n\nI'd look so ungrateful if I were to then ask her to do the same thing every single year as some sort of continual tradition.", "NTA, the idea that your friend can just claim a day as a universal day of mourning because of her own situation forevermore is ridiculous. Especially a holiday.\n\nThe most your friend is entitled to is her to stay home NYE and not want to celebrate the day anymore. She has no right to expect that from others.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Yes, it's a triggering time for them but you also want to party and have fun and not be in a grieving despair before the next year", "NTA. You've been a great friend, but you need to go live your life. Your friend needs to understand that this is a major partying holiday and can't hold everyone hostage due to her grief.", "NTA.

But this is a growing pain of adult friendships: Traditions change. It sounds like you tried to be as kind and supportive as possible while still standing your ground.\n\nPeople suffer tragedies on and around holidays all the time. It does not mean everyone must now denounce the holiday and devote the day instead to mourning their tragedy. That\u2019s not a fair, or even feasible, expectation.\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to create your own traditions. This is the time in your life to explore what those will be. Go have fun. She needs to respect that your life cannot revolve around her needs.", "Major NTA, good job supporting your friend for 9 years, but you have to also remember to live your own life, if you had tried to talk them into going and made a big deal about that I wouldn't be on your side, but you just wanted to go with some people, and she has to be ok with that", "Nta. If this were the year her dad died or the first year anniversary of his death I could understand her needing your support. But dads been gone almost a decade.

Your friend wanted you to continue remembering the father. It sounds like they are still grieving which after 9 years is acceptable. Everyone grieving does it differently.

Tell her to go to therapy bc she is being ridiculous. \n\nGo out and enjoy yourself. You will regret it if you don\u2019t.", "She can see the friend and family earlier in the day and then go and celebrate. OP does not need to be there 24 hours to be supportive.", "Yea the her doing it for so long probably put her in the headspace of expecting friend to be there.", "NTA. My mom died on New Years Eve six years ago, and while I still don\u2019t feel up to celebrating I would never begrudge my friends having a good time.", "It's been 9 years.  NTA.  Even if her dad died at 11:59 pm on NYE, that shouldn't prevent YOU from going out. You have been a great friend but this is not yours to do forever.  Enjoy yourself, this is your life too.", "NTA. You've been going for 9 years, which is more than most people would've done. You also offered to come the next day. \n\nYour friend may need to get counseling to deal with her grief -- specifically, that she wants to control other's actions due to her grief. Hold firm on your boundaries while letting her know you're thinking of her and love her.\n\nIf the texting gets too toxic, put some boundaries for good communication in place. \n\nBasically, it's now time to take care of yourself.

It\u2019s one thing to be there to support your friend in her grief, but she cannot expect you to be there for her every single new year\u2019s eve. It\u2019s not your family matter anyway, and she has other family members that can support her. and for her to blow up at the whole group chat for being insensitive?? \u2018I can\u2019t enjoy that day so none of you should get to have fun\u2019 what kind of logic is that. It would be insensitive if yall forced her to go out and party while she\u2019s grieving. this is not insensitive. she is acting quite entitled."]}
