It muffles the vibration so that the downstairs neighbors don't hear it as easily. I asked my upstairs neighbors who got up at 5 AM to do that (no passive-aggressive notes, I knocked on their door and had a conversation with them about that ONE SPECIFIC THING and gave them an easy solution that they readily were all \"we had no idea you could hear it!

If you write them back, just say: we have rugs down and don't wear shoes inside, so there's nothing more we can do about our footsteps, and we will put a mat down on the table under our alarm, but that's the best we can do.

The old guy had sold up a sizable property and moved into the apartment because he liked the idea of having people around him and had this whole idea of socialising with them, but then did nothing but complain about noise, get nosy about any packages and visitors that arrived and get judgemental about the others who lived there.
