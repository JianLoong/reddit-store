Socks or soft slippers are okay. Hard soled slippers or shoes are bad.  Are you a heavy walker? This may sound a bit ridiculous, but I have a neighbor who is not an unusually large person, but she walks like she's stomping on scorpions. I'm not kidding. Her apartment is adjacent, and when she's stomping around, the floor vibrates so much that my bed shakes.\n\nLook at the placement of your alarms.  In my last apartment, the upstairs neighbors bedroom was above mine, and they used cell phone alarms. They kept their cell phones on the floor right above me, and they always woke me up.\n\nRugs can help quite a lot. Rug runners in hallways and other high traffic areas can help, too.\n\nNTA,  and you shouldn't have to tip toe, but  some creative consideration might help.  I'd do my analysis to make sure I'm doing what I can, then let it go.", "NTA.  Others have explained why.", "NTA, 6:30 isn't even that early. Fact is with apartment living you will hear other people, it's just a fact of life.", "I found the note honestly insulting and entitled. It\u2019s kind of inappropriate to me for adult people to expect those around them to change normal living patterns for their comfort but I thought about this for so long I convinced myself I was the problem haha", "I thought the same about the apartment part. To my knowledge we don\u2019t stomp? And I feel like if we did previous neighbors would\u2019ve mentioned it.

Thanks, lol.", "Hearing alarms is actually very common in buildings with thin walls and wood floors, especially if your phone also vibrates with the alarm. I dealt with this for years when living in multi-unit buildings.\n\nOP, you're NTA, even if your phones do vibrate while using the alarm (totally fine, mine does, too!), but I do have one suggestion...put your phone on a paperback book on your nightstand! It muffles the vibration so that the downstairs neighbors don't hear it as easily. I asked my upstairs neighbors who got up at 5 AM to do that (no passive-aggressive notes, I knocked on their door and had a conversation with them about that ONE SPECIFIC THING and gave them an easy solution that they readily were all \"we had no idea you could hear it! As easy as putting a book under the phone? Done!\"), and no more buuuuuzzzzzzz waking me up at 5 AM!", "Snooze part is very fair, I do want to add I\u2019m hard of hearing so there are times where I don\u2019t hear the alarm within the first 2 seconds of it going off but with vibrate I get to it as soon as I hear/feel it.", "Entire apartment has rugs with the exception of the bathroom and kitchen (it\u2019s a part of the lease agreement) and we have art on most walls, a mounted TV, lots of furniture\u2026 the path to the bathroom doesn\u2019t have as much furniture as it\u2019s a path lol so I wonder if that\u2019s why they hear it more but I don\u2019t know what to do there because adding things would block the walkway", "Thank you! This is extremely validating and makes me feel better. I agree!", "I know I feel the same but no clue what to do since it\u2019s a standard iPhone alarm (not like some crazy loud alarm), I don\u2019t snooze too much but mentioned on another comment I\u2019m hard of hearing so will miss the first ring or two at times, I don\u2019t keep it on the floor etc. \n\nI hear my neighbors alarms around me too but idk I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for me to ask them to change something so necessary to do your day. Someone else recommended putting my phone on a book to muffle the noise but beyond that I got nothing lol", ">  What are you wearing on your feet?\n\n\nYou can't ask people to change their footwear in their own home just to suit you. I wear shoes all day until I'm getting ready to go to bed.", "The complaint seemed to be at night where I am barefoot. Throughout the day I wear either socks or ugg slippers. I don\u2019t believe I\u2019m a heavy walker as I have never been told that and I\u2019ve live in many, many apartments. My neighbors above me are super loud/heavy walkers so I totally get it but I can\u2019t expect them to change how they move their body so just learned to ignore. \n\nMy alarm is on top of my dresser (8 drawer) \n\nEvery room has a rug with the exception of the kitchen and the bathroom. Our leasing agreement requires rugs. \n\nTotally get trying to accommodate but the more I read posts and think about this I\u2019m finding this note/expectation super entitled and unreasonable. As mentioned I do all of these things already and don\u2019t feel like I should have to spend money to accommodate to individuals who are bothered by normal living sounds in a city. Maybe this now makes me the asshole haha", "Another possible \"conciliation,\" some people tend to heel-strike when they walk barefoot, and that can be loud on wood floors. Maybe keep some flip-flops or slippers next to the bed and put them on to use the restroom? You're not doing anything wrong, but this and the book under the phone are just little things that can keep the peace with neighbors. If those aren't good enough for them, F em, they need to go live in the woods and leave notes for the crickets!", "Even if you did stomp it's not something to complain about. I am insanely light on my feet and I had the most flatfooted stompy roommate in the world for about a year. Never said anything to her about it. People walk how they walk, you just cope.", "I literally live in a dorm and I never heard people's alarm from the rooms next to mine so idk what fucking paper mache walls people are using where you live", "Great suggestion - I\u2019m not sure that will make it harder for me to hear but will definitely give it a go on a morning I don\u2019t desperately need to wake up. Thanks!", "That's something else that's so not your fault. From what I see the only asshole here is whoever built this apartment complex", "Yeah you\u2019re def not the ahole ; imo the people complaining should try some soundproofing if it bothers them so much to leave you a note for not crazy levels of noise.\n\n\nMy petty brain wants to tell you to leave a note on their door saying \u201csorry about the thin walls and floor! Welcome to New York :)\u201d\n\n(Obviously don\u2019t do that xD)", "Your alarm is not going off at an outrageously early hour. It has to be loud enough for you to hear it and wake up. As long as it's not on the floor the neighbor is out of line bitching about it.", "That other commenter was wise with the suggestion of putting it on a book (I had already seen that lol and thought the same thing).   An iPhone buzz can travel through walls when it\u2019s on a hard surface.       But yeah if you aren\u2019t snoozing the alarm a bunch of times, not much more you can do.", "Yeah I\u2019m not going to put on shoes to pee at 4am that\u2019s unreasonable and I do pay a large amount of money to live here. Feels like I\u2019m entitled to do my thing in the privacy of my own home", "What?  I am asking you to take off your shoes inside your home to suit me!!   Who wears shoes in their own residence?   Have you tried slippers?  They are amazing.", "Sounds like you've covered all the bases. I wonder if they complained to previous tennants.", "Love this idea but I am literally half asleep zombie just trying to clear my bladder through the night haha I did make sure to start wearing slippers as soon as I woke up tho!", "Ohio, Boston, DC...homes built anywhere from 1905 to 1990. I currently live in a home built in 1960 with 2 layers of brick between my neighbors and me and I can hear them a bit. Not an alarm, but loud talking causes an \"adult in the muppets\" wah wah wah (can't make out words, but there is a \"sound\") kind of sound in my house. The sounds carry because our structures are connected.", "Is your dorm built out of solid concrete like most of them?", "Why are you getting worked up about this lol. I now live in a concrete building wher I hear no alarms, but almost every single place I\u2019ve lived in in the city I\u2019ve been able to hear the alarms from my neighbours.", "Cheap NYC construction lol", "It's more about preventing the vibration from \"carrying\" through the structure. It doesn't really change how you hear the vibration in the same room, but it can make a big difference to someone underneath you. In that same building, we had a resident with a nice surround sound system, but the bass was bothering both his neighbor below and next door. I suggested he put a phone book (back when we still got phone books) under his subwoofer, and it made EVERYONE happy! He could still watch his movies with great sound, and the neighbors didn't feel like their home was shaking while he did!", "I was so tempted too! Haha I don\u2019t want to be rude back but for one moment I really wanted to", "You can't ask the OP to wear slippers in their own home and neither can the downstairs neighbor. You've no business even suggesting it.", "I meant the person asking what I wear on my feet hahaha I don\u2019t wear shoes in my house just go barefoot or with slippers. I just don\u2019t find the comments advising me to put slippers on to pee in the dead of night reasonable", "They\u2019re new to the building, about a month, so perhaps first time city dwellers? No clue honestly", "Love this - so helpful thanks friend!", "Forget OP, I am asking you!   My preference is no shoes inside.  Yes I do have no business suggesting it.", "Oh that explains it.   They aren\u2019t used to having neighbors above them.    Bet their last place was single unit or top floor or something.   If you aren\u2019t used to neighbors above you, it\u2019s really jarring when you move.   I bet they think you guys are full on stompers but that\u2019s because they haven\u2019t heard YOUR upstairs neighbor.", "It's really a problems about their unreasonable or inexperienced expectations. You aren't doing anything beyond normal reasonable living. NTA"]}
