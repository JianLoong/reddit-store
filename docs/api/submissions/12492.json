It muffles the vibration so that the downstairs neighbors don't hear it as easily. I asked my upstairs neighbors who got up at 5 AM to do that (no passive-aggressive notes, I knocked on their door and had a conversation with them about that ONE SPECIFIC THING and gave them an easy solution that they readily were all \"we had no idea you could hear it!

They can take it to court technically if it is persistently an issue, just throwing that out there", "NTA.

I also imagine she walks like a toddler, planting her feet hard with each step.

If you write them back, just say: we have rugs down and don't wear shoes inside, so there's nothing more we can do about our footsteps, and we will put a mat down on the table under our alarm, but that's the best we can do.

The old guy had sold up a sizable property and moved into the apartment because he liked the idea of having people around him and had this whole idea of socialising with them, but then did nothing but complain about noise, get nosy about any packages and visitors that arrived and get judgemental about the others who lived there.

As for you, you cannot help your work schedule or how you walk (don't know if you are heavy/light footed). Sometimes hearing your neighbors walking around is just part of living in apartments especially older ones that don't have the best construction.", "NTA\n\nI used to ha enough a downstairs neighbour complaining about my 2yr old running around, she even complained to the council. Some people are just ridiculous!", "As a small child we lived in an apartment with the same problem. Just normal walking would make the downstairs neighbor's chandelier shake. She would always bang on the ceiling with a broom. We called her the witch. These problems are actually created by cheap construction. NTA", "NTA.", "NTA keep the note and show it to your apartment manager. (In case they escalate.) I live in apartment with noise\u2026\u2026\u2026 I sleep with a fan on. Live your life and ignore your neighbor!", "NTA seems like you're trying to be reasonable. Also kind of sound like the downstairs people are though. Doesn't see like they came at you in a crazy way.  It's NYC, people have much different schedules sometimes as well.  Sounds more of a building problem.  Maybe just try to talk to them.  Let them know whats up and if there's any simple things you can change to help.  If not then well sorry but that's just how the building is.  They can then take it up with the building if they want.", "NTA \n\nIf they leave another note, print them out an ad for a white noise machine - or tape a pair of earplugs on their door", "Some people have a heavy walk. Can you try to walk more lightly?", "NTA.  If they don\u2019t want to hear normal apartment sounds, they shouldn\u2019t live in an apartment, or they should move into a unit on the top floor so they don\u2019t have anyone above them.\n\nMy parents dealt with this recently with their neighbour below them.  It\u2019s exhausting.", "NTA but If you both have to get up a few times to pee then one of you may have a medical problem like sleep apnea (and is waking the other one up)\n\n...Here's the thing, by and large, people have to pee in the night **because they wake up**, not the other way around. This is because unless someone drinks copious water before bed, the kidneys typically don't send urine to the bladder during sleep. If one of you snores and wakes up a few times to pee they should definitely see a doctor because untreated sleep apnea can lead to a fatal heart attack", "NTA, but you should check your lease - most of the ones I\u2019ve had in NYC have a clause about a certain percent of your floor needing to be covered with rugs. This is almost exclusively for sound dampening purposes. Make sure you have this so if they do try to raise their complaints to the building management/landlord you can be fully in compliance of your lease.", "NTA Do they expect you to quit your job and start to piss in a bottle? They can be happy that you don't have children.", "Print out a link to this thread and put that through their door. Let them see the entire internet shame them.\n\nNTA", "Bad news. I grew up in bumfuck nowhere. There's a ton of noise there too. Squirrels in the attic, tractors planting/harvesting/plowing, helicopters or planes spraying fields, the incessant braying of the neighbors two donkeys (because they protect the beef herd). The only way to get no noise I think is to live in like, the ISS.", "Agree NTA! My landlady lives above me and I can hear her walking around whenever she\u2019s home. If anything, it is nice to know there\u2019s someone else around doing their day-to-day things.", "I meant clog style slippers lol you know like the cheap ones you get at Walmart that are soft", "NTA. It is and I'd consider giving management a heads up before they do. I lived in a building with a couple like this and it escalated to the point where the police got called because they got in the upstairs neighbors face & their children were terrified. People like that should not be living in shared living environments if they have such delicate sensibilities.", "I'd play with them and start leaving them notes", " \n\nI grew up in NYC and we had a guy on our floor who would complain about literally any sound he heard.", "Hilariously, the ISS is pretty loud, due to all the pumps and fans keeping the equipment running.  There are even decibel meters to make sure that their regulations on sound levels are adhered to and that the astronauts stay healthy.\n\nI think the quietest area would be nighttime in a rural area with snowpack.  Cold keeps the animals from being active and noisy, and the snow absorbs sound.", "Clogs are pretty much defined by being carved wood. \n\nSlippers are generally soft. But i have no conception how they would be clog like. They have pointed tips? They have no laces? \n\nI have never been to a walmart.", " \n\nYou might consider putting an extra layer of carpet in your bedroom to see if it pushes the footprint a bit more.", "Currently surprise moving to a new place because the smokers* in my building threw an entire tantrum about being told (2x by management) to stop smoking outside my windows \ud83d\ude11 I'm excited about it though because it's a bigger place and management is doing everything in their power to be accommodating. I'll miss the cast iron tub but it'll be worth it to not have people chain-smoking outside my windows for hours and having a fit when I put up privacy curtains and window frost."]}
