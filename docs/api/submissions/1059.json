We own our primary home where we live in our rural hometown, and a small two bedroom apartment in the city that's around a 3 hour drive away.\n\nWe purchased the apartment around 5 years ago with the original intention of using it to have spontaneous weekends away. However two years ago, Chloe got accepted into a university that was in that city.\n\nWe decided to let Chloe stay in the apartment, and we'd pay all the utilities. Chloe is still staying in the apartment and has another two years left of her degree.\n\nThis year, Lorna got accepted into the same university and she asked us if she could stay in the apartment with Chloe. We didn't see why not and informed Chloe that her sister was going to be joining her.\n\nChloe was really angry and said that we should've asked her if it was okay, and said that she needs her own space. We reminded Chloe that they'll be able to have their own bedrooms and that it's only a temporary arrangement until she graduates and finds a job.\n\nChloe told us that's not the point. She said that she already uses the spare bedroom as her study room and that she doesn't want to live with Lorna. She said that Lorna is annoying and that she likes living on her own.\n\nMy husband reminded Chloe that she's staying in the apartment for free and that Lorna has just as much right to be there as she does and that they can figure out on their own how to not get on each other's nerves.\n\nLorna moved in at the start of the semester around 2 months ago. At first it seemed to be going well, I regularly check up on both Chloe and Lorna and they didn't mention any problems.\n\nLast week, Chloe called me and demanded that I kick Lorna out. She said that she can't stand living with Lorna anymore and that she needs to have her own place. \n\nI asked Chloe what's going on and she described very petty problems such as Lorna's room being messy, not having a study room, not being able to play the TV on loud at night, etc. I told Chloe that that's the reality of living with other people and that she needs to learn how to compromise, and that we aren't kicking Lorna out.\n\nChloe protested and said that she was living there first and implied that Lorna should live in dorms because she's younger. She kept talking over me and shouting into the phone when I was trying to explain that would be unreasonable. I eventually lost my temper and told Chloe if she doesn't like it she can move out and pay rent and bills elsewhere. Chloe started crying and said that I should be more understanding then hung up the phone.\n\nMy husband thinks that Chloe is just acting like a brat and that we shouldn't entertain it, and that my response was fine. But Chloe has been ignoring my texts and calls and is clearly upset by my comment so I'm wondering if I was wrong.", "created_utc": 1667535282, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yloj3q/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_if_she_doesnt_like/", "score": 4437, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is very lucky that you gave her this opportunity and she is abusing it and taking it for granted.", "NTA.  Chloe is a brat.  The apartment is yours, not hers.  Don't let her bully you into something else.  I'm concerned that she may be bullying Lorna to get her to move.", "NTA\n\nCheck in with Lorna. It must be hell living with Chloe.\n\nChloe lived in a two-bedroom apartment on her own without having to pay utilities and rent for the first two years. She should be grateful.\n\nReally, the fair thing would be to kick her out so Lorna gets the same experience. (I\u2019m not suggesting you do that - just highlight to Chloe that if anyone\u2019s missing out here, it\u2019s actually Lorna.)", "NTA\n\nThere is no possibility of you being the AH here. Chloe is 23, living on your dime, and it\u2019s past time to start adulting.", "NTA. Your husband is right, she's throwing a tantrum, ignore her.  This is no different than living in a dorm or other shared housing, find a way to get along.  She should be thankful she's got the ability to live somewhere free of rent and utilities.  If she'd like to dictate who she lives with, she shouldn't live in someone else's home.", "NTA. Your husband nailed it. Chloe is being a brat and has no idea how fortunate she is to be in  family that can provide her a free home near her university to share with her sister.", "NTA. She got to live in the house for free and your other daughter gets the same opportunity. Your husband is right she is acting entitled and spoilt. She does have to face the reality of living with other people and doesn't seem to understand that.", "NTA, your husband is right, she\u2019s a spoiled brat", "NTA. your response was very reasonable. it\u2019s a property YOU own, and you\u2019re letting her, an adult, stay there for free. she should be nothing but grateful. welcome to adulthood, chloe. it\u2019s hard. get used to it.", "NTA. Chloe is living in your home for free, she doesn't own it and doesn't participate in paying any bills or the upkeep of the home.

You\u2019re totally right and unless Lorna is being a horrific roommate, which is doesn\u2019t sound like, then Chloe is in the wrong.

You rightly set her straight and don't second-guess yourself on this.\n\nYou should remind her that this apartment was never intended specifically as her domicile, it was to be you and your husbands pied a terre, an opportunity you have deferred in favor of allocating a family resource to whom it is of the most use.

Chloe is acting like a spoiled brat because she is one. I think you should have a talk with both girls since both need to learn to live with each other. The key is that you can't tell them what to do. They both have to want to do it. \n\nTalk to them separately about what could improve then bring them together and ask them how they can compromise on these items so both girls can be happy. Also ask them what happens if they don't do what they say they will do. What happens if Lorna doesn't clean up after herself? What happens if Chloe blasts loud movies at night? Don't threaten them. Just ask them what they think should happen if they don't follow up on their promises. \n\nRemember, don't tell them what to do. They are adults now. That won't work. And don't make any threats (kicking them out) if you are not emotionally prepared to see them through. I know you didn't do it in your post, but this thought could cross your mind if discussions get heated.

Bluetooth headphones and she can have them as loud as she wants\n\nNo study space? There are libraries for that\n\nMessy room? Don\u2019t go in there!! They are living there for free.

Chloe is acting very entitled, and if she continues her antics, you may have to firmly tell her that she either accepts the living free arrangements or she can find her own place that can meet her needs. You have been more than generous with her and she will more than likely get a shock when she researches the costs of a 2 bedroom apartment in many areas.", "NTA it's your house.

Its difficult and upsetting to deal with this is a parent, but in my honest opinion it will be best to stick to your original assertion.

Maybe you should tell them that if one moves out they both do, and have to pay for housing.", ">Chloe started crying and said that I should be more understanding then hung up the phone.\n\nWhy do so many people in AITA posts apparently say this when they really mean, \"you should be taking my side only.\" Being understanding or seeing something as valid is not the same thing as wholesale supporting it. A person can hate object A due to a traumatic experience sure, but that doesn't justify them policing other peoples access or involvement with object A. So it goes that Chloe, \"wanting space and a study room\" doesn't justify her being a brat.\n\nAlso, I'm to undersand this is an apartment...as in within a building with other units. Surely the other people in that building dislike her loud TV at all hours, \"just because she can\" as much as Lorna does.

Has she ever expressed being burdened with care tasks for her sister?", "NTA.

She can move.\n\nEdit: tell Chloe if she wants to dictate the living situation in your apartment, she can start paying rent and utilities (say $2000 a month or whatever a 2 bedroom plus utilities runs, then you can use that money from Chloe to rent an apartment for your other daughter). She\u2019s now a tenant and it\u2019s her apartment so she can kick her sister out (to the other apartment that she\u2019s now paying for). Everyone is happy.

You said nothing wrong and you were in fact quite reserved.  Chloe is an entitled brat....sorry but she sounds like a nightmare.  Just imagine what poor Lorna is going through.  \n\nWhy would you even tell Chloe that Lorna will only be there until she graduates and gets a job?  Are you planning on Chloe staying there?  Will Chloe pay rent because if not then once Lorna moves out you should pay her rent too.  \n\nThis all sounds like Chloe has been spoiled for too long and the favoured child.  I mean seriously....how can you even ask if you were in the wrong when your daughter is acting so nasty to everyone????   It's like you don't want to face the truth about her which may be the contributing factor for her being such an entitled bully.", "NTA, your husband is right. Chloe is being a brat. It's perfectly fine to not be able to live well with others, I know I struggle. What isn't fine is expecting to live rent free and for everyone else to accommodate her preference.", "NTA\n\nYou and your husband were absolutely correct.

I hope she's not making her sister's life unbearable and that should be checked on. If Chloe kerps this harassment of her sister up and not answering your calls I would tell her she needs to leave the apartment and stay in dorms.", "NTA. This sounds reasonable and fair. I can see her being a little annoyed at being told instead of it being discussed but then to get over it.\n\nChloe does sound very entitled & maybe she is. If she is, check on Lorna because she might not be having the best time living with her.\n\nHowever if that\u2019s super out of character I would be wondering what else could be going on here because the reaction seems extreme. Mental health issues that make it hard to live with others? Lorna bullying her and it\u2019s been ignored for years because she\u2019s younger? Something about her lifestyle she thinks you will not accept?", "NTA, you just told her what she needed to hear. \n\nI can appreciate being annoyed about the change in living arrangements without being talked to about it first, and she might feel resentful at having to share with her sister.

That her sister may join after a while?).\n\nOn the other hand she now just has to accept this, it was already a huge benefit for her. She can either share the place or rent another apartment.

She is not held hostage there, she is free to move and PAY for own very own accommodations.  Real life may hit her very hard.

I don\u2019t know what kind of a university they are going to, but my guess would be that Chloe got used to the idea that she has a fancy apartment all to herself that she doesn\u2019t have to pay a dime for. Not sure how it is there, but here, that would\u2019ve still elevated you amongst your peers because you have your own space, no costs and an easy pad to hang out and have a party or two during your studies.

It isn\u2019t up to her to decide whether her sister can live there or not because she has the exact same right as Chloe does. It also is incredibly selfish of her to claim that she needs HER space and she needs HER time but her sister should learn to share and live in a dorm.\n\nI also think that OP should message to Chloe that there was never any agreement that this apartment was for Chloe to use alone.

If OP didn\u2019t tell Chloe right when she moved into the apartment that this apartment is for sharing should Lorna decide to go into the same university then I can see - a little bit - how the entitlement came, but nevertheless Chloe has some nerve to try and claim ownership of the place when she hasn\u2019t paid a cent towards it.", "> My husband thinks that Chloe is just acting like a brat and that we shouldn't entertain it, and that my response was fine.

Harsher way would have been ok we can kick you out and you can fend for yourself starting now. That would be kinda cruel to actually enforce since she isn't working yet. But you did right. I get her \"you should have asked\", but in this case asking her implies she has a choice and she doesn't, because she's not paying anything on that apartment nor is it hers. If she wishes to live without her sister then SHE could try and apply for a dorm. Sometimes when you share space with someone there are bound to be issues but if the biggest one is \"hEr RoOm Is MeSsy!\" and \"i CaN't WaTcH tV lOuD wHeN i WaNt!\" it sounds like a tantrum. I get is a tough adjustment after living alone to share the space again but tough bananas, she has to, unless she wishes to move on her own dime. It happens. She actually is being a brat. You could try the gentle approach and have a conversation with her try to make her see reason but it doesn't seem to me like she does and if she won't return your calls, you should go down there and have a conversation with her in person.

This is not most people's experience during college or even while getting their own place for the first time. She's still young and the real world is all bills and responsibilities. tbh you should've been charging them at least a little rent to get them ready for it (maybe putting that rent away for later for them as a surprise) but now it'd be kinda too late cause your eldest lived there for free. She juts wants what she wants but what she wants isn't really fair. So yeah she's gonna be mad but you're right and your husband's right. She needs a dose of reality.

Even living separately we still don't get along very well. These \"petty things\" that are bothering your oldest might just be the things she can openly state as a problem vs all the little things that are just adding up but don't make sense as an issue if told to someone who is not there.\n\nI agree with you and what you said. If she doesn't like it, she can move out. That's what my sister did. That what I did once I couldn't take living at home any more (and had the money to move out). It does cost a lot to be on your own but it's either pay the finical cost of living alone or the emotional cost of living with another person.\n\nDon't write off your older daughters struggles with her younger sister, living together might be really difficult for them. My sister and I couldn't even do three days together when I needed to crash on her couch when my AC went out in 90 degree weather. They might just not be compatible roommates, and that's okay! But don't kick out either kid, the arrangement you have set up is fair, and if either of them don't like it, they can move out.

Then break dancers moved in upstairs, three of them and they were training a fourth that was too tall and would fall constantly! I also didn't have a car in a city with terrible public transportation, so had to bike everywhere. I even got hit by a car while biking to class once. That was hell, but I was greatful for my education and to have a place to live, because I was even poorer as a child.

My friends who freeloaded off of their parents for a few years post-grad haven\u2019t made it nearly as far in their careers because they never had the fire under their ass of having to pay for all their wants AND needs.

Does she have equal cupboard space?  Does she feel like it\u2019s a safe space? I really think Chloe needs a reality check and if she can\u2019t treat Lorna equally, should potentially look at dorms. She\u2019s had an amazing experience to date. Lorna has had the opposite.", "NTA\n\n> Chloe lived in a two-bedroom apartment on her own without having to pay utilities and rent for the first two years. She should be grateful.\n\nThis. I would tell her she can either start treating you (and her sister) with respect, or she will be finding (and paying for) her own apartment.", "What do you want to bet Chloe was planning to keep living there rent free after college with a 2 bedroom all to herself?\n\nNTA", "I was thinking this too. I feel so bad for Lorna. Her big sister got a cushy college experience, and she\u2019s (probably) getting tormented for simply existing in her own home. (Eta I say probably because if this is how Chloe lashes out at their mom, I can\u2019t imagine she\u2019s much kinder on the day to day)", "Actually no, as long as Chloe is out after she graduates, Lorna will get 2 years without her at the end of her college life, which sounds better as you already have friends and know the city. But still Chloe sounds insufferable NTA", "Yeah, what an entitled child. Its her parent's apartment not hers, she has no say in her sister living there.\n\nI agree, just suggest to chloe that to be fair Lorna should get to live in the appartment alone a few years too now and she is old enough to get a side job and find an appartment at 24.", "Right? I\u2019d be throwing a fit if I also didn\u2019t get my free 2 bed apartment too lol\n\nNTA for sure", "Right? My sister lives in an apartment my parents own, and I can't imagine her pitching a fit if I had to go live with her for some reason. But she's not an entitled ass.\n\nOP is NTA all day.", "Lorna should get that when chloe finished college right?", "Though to be fair, Lorna will probably have that apartment to herself once Chloe is finished with university. Fair doesn't always mean equal.", "oh id bet when chloe was done with school, she still wouldnt move out.... shes got it to damn good", "Honestly it may be a good thing to kick chloe out and give Lorna the same opportunity to live alone. Check Chloes privilege and make her a bit more appreciative of her opportunities. Another thing why didnt Chloe start university until 21??? Did she take a few gap years and galivant around the world on parents dime? Has she ever worked? Is this a graduate degree?  No matter what she seems extremely entitled,  but she could be even worse than OP presents.", "NTA OP. Your husband is right. Kick the brat out and let her see what it is liking living in the real world.", "I bet Chloe basically considered the flat hers due to living alone in it for two years, which is why she is territorial now. That and it\u2019s harder to lay claim to it if your sister is given the same access. Chloe maybe thought she could graduate and then transition it to a family home in the future, neatly freezing out her sibling. Those are the vibes I get anyway, just short of yelling \u2018mine\u2019 and stamping her feet\u2026", "My guess is that she was doing something else in the flat that she doesn\u2019t want mom and dad to know about. That\u2019s why she is pouring it on, Like boyfriends, girlfriends, drugs and or partying. She\u2019s mad she can\u2019t continue.", "If I was OP and I found out Chloe was trying to bully Lorna out of the flat I would immediately change the locks and give only Lorna a key. On the spot eviction.", "My (f) first college housing was a rented house I shared with 3 engineering students, all male (2 dedicated slobs and a compulsive neat freak). Chloe should count her lucky stars!", "Me, as an adult doesn't even have 2 bedrooms. And i think i never will. She's so spoiled.", "Right? I wonder if she\u2019s being bullied by her own sister smh. It\u2019s her sister ffs not a complete stranger. \n\nOP don\u2019t second guess yourself I\u2019m sorry but you\u2019ve got a spoiled brat on your hands. \n\nIt\u2019s a blessing and a *privilege* to not only be able to go to college but also rent free in an apartment and not have to worry about anything else other than school. She\u2019s just entitled that\u2019s it. You gave the most reasonable, level headed response. Don\u2019t like it? Move out.\n\nDon\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you. Simple. I could never imagine living some where completely free and telling the owners let alone my parents what they can and can\u2019t do with their space. Stick to your guns. \n\nPlus If she tells other people why she\u2019s mad at her parents and she says \u201cbecause they made me live with my sister in the apartment they pay for\u201d I can guarantee she\u2019ll be met with an eye roll and a response along the lines of seriously?", ">I would bet my last dollar that it is actually about losing the freedom for having overnight guests without the risk of being tattled on.\n\novernight guests, drugs/alcohol, parties, maybe she had a friend (actual or romantic) crashing in the spare room, etc. any number of reasons I can see her being upset with having a younger sibling there who might tattle lol", "You forgot indulging in the horizontal tango. Can't have that kind of fun with sis around as well.", "The irony is if she cultivated a good relationship with Lorna, she probably could have overnight guests and not worry about her saying something", "I mean the parent raised a brat... so there's some levell of not fantastic choices....", "I feel like, 'tell me you're raising an entitled adult without telling me you're raising an entitled adult.' \n\nShe is not showing any gratefulness for the generosity of her parents. I am scared to know what the sister is going through. If she is screaming at the mom, what I'd she saying to the sister? \n\nI would text her, \"You're right this is unfair. You have had the apartment to yourself you two years. Therefore, your father and I would like you to move out the the end of the semester, so your sister can get her first two years of college having her own apartment. And since you have been ignoring my texts and calls, no need to respond to this one. I will expect you out by \"enter date\".\"\n\nLet see if she'll ignore that text.", "Yepppp. Unless you're alone in a house with separation between you and the next house that's unacceptable.", "This. She'll see when she has to pay for her own 2 bedroom apartment because she needs a study room.", "Totally agree with this, but also it\u2019s not like its some random stranger she\u2019s living with. Its literally her sister. They\u2019ve lived together before, and now she suddenly has a problem with it? \n\nNTA at all.", "I don\u2019t think OP is oblivious to how wrong Chloe\u2019s behaviour is, or she would not have reacted the way she did. But I think she is susceptible to Chloe\u2019s manipulation. Fortunately her husband and us can reiterate that OP is handling this just fine.\n\nFor the record, being able and willing to give your child an easier time at university is not enabling anything, but allowing for ungrateful and condescending behaviour is.", "Then Chloe can move out. She got two years rent-free in her own private place and she doesn't want her sistet to have that same experience. She wants her sister tonsuck it up and live in a dorm when she never had to (also costing the parents mkre)\n\nChloe would get two years on her own + two years with Lorna and Lorna would get the same. It is fair and Chloe is acting like a spoiled diva.", "Your argument seems to be that Chloe has got used to an incredibly privileged living situation for two years so OP is al asshole for taking that away from her.\n\nChloe\u2019s perspective is nothing short of embarrassing for a 23 year old woman. To demand that your sister not get the privilege you got all because you got \u201cused to\u201d living alone? She \u201cneeds\u201d a study room? Give me a break, tens of millions of people graduate university without anything like that.", "But this is not Chloe's apartment- her parents are only allowing her to use it while she is in school. She shouldn't have assumed that she's be living there forever and gotten comfortable. As her parents own they place, they get to say who can and cannot move in there.\n\nChole is 23- if she can not live with her sister, she can be the adult and move into the dorms or alternate housing.", "It\u2019s not her space though it was never given too her.", "Your argument is flawed because the person moving in is also their daughter, not a cousin or a stranger. If she finds it so upsetting, then she can move out to make space for her sister, who has just as much right to the apartment.", "I agree with this! They didn\u2019t take into account their other child\u2019s feelings or what it might to do Chloe\u2019s routine or life. \n\nEveryone forgets the children are people with actually feelings and lives of their own. Should Chloe handled this better because she gets to live rent free? Probably, but being forced to live with your sister without say is a shitty thing. These parents should have at least had a discussion with a Chloe and their other child about the living arrangements.", "She has no say she is being selfish and entitled.", "It's certainly entitled as fuck(and bratty) to assume she'd get to keep the free two bedroom apartment all to herself when her younger sister was going to school in the same city. This is something that should have been *expected*.", "Chloe\u2019s feels are not the centre of the universe. Chloe has been extremely privileged to have been given use of an apartment for free. Somewhere along the line she seems to have forgotten it wasn\u2019t hers. Her sibling has an equal need to the property. It is up to the parents to allow her to also use their other property. In this case, it is perfectly reasonable for the parents to say, sister now lives here too. Sometimes we don\u2019t need to ask a child\u2019s permission. You are going to be very uncomfortable in the real world if this is your approach. \n\nChloe would rather keep a separate study room instead and expects her parents to pay for, or worse, for her sister to pay for dorms. Rather than use the available room. That\u2019s very selfish behaviour. \n\n\u2018Forcing sister on me in the home I was living in\u2019 bollocks to that. If you owned or rented then you might have a point. In a home owned by someone else, that you are occupying rent and utilities free? Nope. That comes with conditions for anyone reasonable, and a sibling moving in, is a very reasonable ask. \n\nChloe\u2019s response is one of pure entitlement and selfishness. She needs to get over that very rapidly or she will have a dose of the real world and it\u2019s rental costs that will come as a shock.", "Then Chloe can move out and get her own place that she pays for herself. I'm an older sister and would never be that ungrateful.", "Well she *could* have legit issues.  For all we know Lorna could be a god awful roommate.  But she\u2019s lost touch with reality when demanding, talking over, and shouting at the person financing her life.  \n\nAny parents in their right mind would have to shut that shit down, it won\u2019t serve her well in life and she needs to be brought back down to reality where that apartment is not hers, she\u2019s paid for nothing, and she very much needs to be considering how she\u2019s going to leave the apartment because her parents don\u2019t want to finance her life forever.  They\u2019re covering this portion of her life to bridge the gap into adulthood, not to set a precedent.", "Why punish Lorna for Chloe\u2019s attitude?", "Also: What does Chloe not understand about the whole notion of: This is NOT your property!?!?!", ">And she MUST know her college experience of having parents pay for everything isn't the same as most college kids.\n\nis this an american thing? in europe it's the norm that your parents do pay for your apartment and help you cover your expenses, anything less is seen as cruel", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s being passive-aggressive at all. I think she\u2019s being regular-aggressive.", "Tell chloe she needs an attitude adjustment.  You expect her to answer your calls and respond to text.  When she is out of your wallet she can be a brat.  Also remind her that her attitude better be on her best behavior with her sister.  If she can't be civil she can move out.  Entitlement is not going to happen here.  Have some therapy with her to have a neutral person to get her to understand.   3rd party can day the exact same thing you said but they listen to them.", "I think it was a mistake that the parents didn't seem to set house rules/the terms for Chloe living there from the start. You can stay there for four years for college, but it remains our apartment - you are a guest and these are the rules... etc. Obviously they might not have anticipated that Lorna would move in, but it sounds like Chloe has felt that the apartment now belongs to her alone, and that is not the case.", "Yes, OP i think you should drop by sometime to see, for yourself, how the dynamic is going. If you drop by unannounced, you can get a glimpse of how it is by checking few things like the state of common rooms, kitchen, etc. Protect the youngest.", "You are asking the correct questions! And it is not like they haven't lived together before either. I get that she got used to living alone, but she has to give that up now that lil sis has gotten into the same college and gets to reap the same benefits of a paid off apartment. This is a rare luxury and big sis doesn't get that. And to just not answer Mom's calls? No ma'am, no ham, no turkey!", "Or that she was having a guest in that room!", "why do you have faith in her to move out once college is done, this is \"her\" place after all, why would she move?", "So they will both have it to themselves for two years and share for the balance", "Well, that seems pretty equal as well: Chloe got two years alone, then two years with her sister. Lorna is getting two years with her sister, then two years alone.", "Chloe is already 23 and she hasn't graduated and moved out.", "Then they will each get two years of the apartment alone.", "why isnt this top comment!", "Right? All of my student flats were awful. My last one had mushrooms growing on the walls and a slug infestation! Maybe Chloe should move out and then she'd appreciate what she had and lost, thanks to her attitude. It might reduce her bratty entitlement issues.", "i spent my first two years in 12x13 ft dorm rooms with another person in the room with me\u2026.oh to have the privilege to be mad about not having a study room", "Me, as an adult dreaming of the day I might one day live in a one bedroom flat (not a studio,or a shared flat): so spoiled. She has no idea what side her bread is buttered on", "The only thing that keeps me going is the fantasizing of one day possibly having a room to play music in", "Me retiring in a few years and living in a studio...a large one at that with a garage space. And I'm truly grateful. But Chloe has a rude awakening ahead of her!", "She got 2 years alone.", "She may have been actually making money renting out the spare bedroom.", "Aww someone beat me to it lol. I was going to comment that exact thing.\n\n\"Tell her that because of her behavior, she needs to have her shit packed and herself out by the end of the month. See how quickly she responds to that one.\"", "Maybe their relationship wasn't really so good before lol.", "She is not being forced to live with her sister. She can live in the dorms or get an apartment like most college students. She is not entitled to a 2 bedroom apartment all to herself. She can have all the feelings she wants about having to share the apartment she doesn't pay a dime for, but the parents aren't assholes for not making Lorna live in the dorms or whatever just because Chloe has \"feelings\" about it.", "This is how I see it. Chloe should have realized that her parents would make Lorna the same offer they made her. Instead she is demanding special and better treatment.", "More avoiding Lorna being blamed than punishing her. Seems like Chloe would be likely to take it out on Lorna and Lorna is already putting up with so much from Chloe. They both go into on campus housing for the next two years and once Chloe is finished Lorna can go back to the apartment and spend her two years alone in it. In the meantime, parents need to seriously help Chloe grow up and stop being so entitled.", "In most of Europe, kids aren't paying astronomical prices for college to begin with. Some American kids can go into six figure debt just trying to get a Master's degree.\n\nEDIT: Oi! Don't down vote the person asking a question. It's not their doing that Europe has affordable higher education, they're just asking a question.", "To answer your question, no, it is definitely not the norm in America, sadly. I have a friend who graduated from law school a quarter million in debt. Which is also not the norm, but graduating with debt is.", "In Europe it doesn\u2019t cost $60,000+ a year to go to university", "Lol, I had to beg my parents to help cover one month of rent, and they demanded I pay it back with interest.", "Active-aggressive.", "If she is out right aggressive OP would immediately kick her out likely. But being passive if she is smart then she can wiggle a little more. That's why I say she would likely do passive things. An attempt to be \"subtle\" while maintaining the look of innocence to an extent. If you are Argo with it then you lose the innocent aspect. Right now she is seeing active aggressive won't work so she will switch tactics to get what she wants.", "This here. Mom is worried she's doing the wrong thing, but if you look at this in terms of landlord / tenant situation where one tenant complains about the other tenant, the one complaining can't really cease communications and hope the landlord to choose her side.", "Exactly. Her roof her rules.", "I think Chloe is old enough to realize they were not giving her the apartment on a permanent basis especially since it was meant for themselves. If she thought differently that is something she decided on her own. She needs to realize that it's not all about her. Also I kind of wonder exactly what she is doing that she doesn't want anyone to know. Like a secret live in boyfriend who is now waiting for Chloe to get rid of her sister so he can get his free living quarters back.", "Aways.", "Yes, Chloe used to live alone. Now she can't, and she's pissed off !\n\nBut all she has to do is think, what if the roles were reversed? What if SHE had been the younger sister? Wouldn't SHE want to move into a rent-free apartment? How would CHLOE feel to be the younger sister, and be told to move into dorms?\n\nBeing able to see things from others' point of view is so valuable. It can really put it all into perspective.", "Gonna have to steal that last bit. Thanks for the chuckle, I needed it! \n\nAlso, I agree.", "It's probably less faith in her than in her parents. They seem to be treating their daughters pretty fairly and would probably put the foot down of them only staying in the apartment during college.", "Or that she\u2019ll finish college?\n\nIf she knows she\u2019ll have to pay her own rent when she\u2019s done with school, why wouldn\u2019t she stretch it out to 5 years?\n\nOP needs to make sure she knows it\u2019s 4 years in the apartment no matter what.", "From what OP wrote she started university 2 years ago and is halfway through her studies.

I think a lot of young adults living on their own for the first time would be unhappy to have to share with a younger sibling again. And that also depends on the family dynamics -- maybe the sisters don't get along, or Chloe felt like her sister was dependent on her and she was grateful for the freedom and space to be her own person?
