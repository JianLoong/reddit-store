We own our primary home where we live in our rural hometown, and a small two bedroom apartment in the city that's around a 3 hour drive away.\n\nWe purchased the apartment around 5 years ago with the original intention of using it to have spontaneous weekends away. However two years ago, Chloe got accepted into a university that was in that city.\n\nWe decided to let Chloe stay in the apartment, and we'd pay all the utilities. Chloe is still staying in the apartment and has another two years left of her degree.\n\nThis year, Lorna got accepted into the same university and she asked us if she could stay in the apartment with Chloe. We didn't see why not and informed Chloe that her sister was going to be joining her.\n\nChloe was really angry and said that we should've asked her if it was okay, and said that she needs her own space. We reminded Chloe that they'll be able to have their own bedrooms and that it's only a temporary arrangement until she graduates and finds a job.\n\nChloe told us that's not the point. She said that she already uses the spare bedroom as her study room and that she doesn't want to live with Lorna. She said that Lorna is annoying and that she likes living on her own.\n\nMy husband reminded Chloe that she's staying in the apartment for free and that Lorna has just as much right to be there as she does and that they can figure out on their own how to not get on each other's nerves.\n\nLorna moved in at the start of the semester around 2 months ago. At first it seemed to be going well, I regularly check up on both Chloe and Lorna and they didn't mention any problems.\n\nLast week, Chloe called me and demanded that I kick Lorna out. She said that she can't stand living with Lorna anymore and that she needs to have her own place. \n\nI asked Chloe what's going on and she described very petty problems such as Lorna's room being messy, not having a study room, not being able to play the TV on loud at night, etc. I told Chloe that that's the reality of living with other people and that she needs to learn how to compromise, and that we aren't kicking Lorna out.\n\nChloe protested and said that she was living there first and implied that Lorna should live in dorms because she's younger. She kept talking over me and shouting into the phone when I was trying to explain that would be unreasonable. I eventually lost my temper and told Chloe if she doesn't like it she can move out and pay rent and bills elsewhere. Chloe started crying and said that I should be more understanding then hung up the phone.\n\nMy husband thinks that Chloe is just acting like a brat and that we shouldn't entertain it, and that my response was fine. But Chloe has been ignoring my texts and calls and is clearly upset by my comment so I'm wondering if I was wrong.", "created_utc": 1667535282, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yloj3q/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_if_she_doesnt_like/", "score": 129, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is very lucky that you gave her this opportunity and she is abusing it and taking it for granted.", "NTA.  Chloe is a brat.  The apartment is yours, not hers.  Don't let her bully you into something else.  I'm concerned that she may be bullying Lorna to get her to move.", "NTA\n\nCheck in with Lorna. It must be hell living with Chloe.\n\nChloe lived in a two-bedroom apartment on her own without having to pay utilities and rent for the first two years. She should be grateful.\n\nReally, the fair thing would be to kick her out so Lorna gets the same experience. (I\u2019m not suggesting you do that - just highlight to Chloe that if anyone\u2019s missing out here, it\u2019s actually Lorna.)", "NTA\n\nThere is no possibility of you being the AH here. Chloe is 23, living on your dime, and it\u2019s past time to start adulting.", "NTA. Your husband is right, she's throwing a tantrum, ignore her.  This is no different than living in a dorm or other shared housing, find a way to get along.  She should be thankful she's got the ability to live somewhere free of rent and utilities.  If she'd like to dictate who she lives with, she shouldn't live in someone else's home.", "NTA. Your husband nailed it. Chloe is being a brat and has no idea how fortunate she is to be in  family that can provide her a free home near her university to share with her sister.", "NTA. She got to live in the house for free and your other daughter gets the same opportunity. Your husband is right she is acting entitled and spoilt. She does have to face the reality of living with other people and doesn't seem to understand that.", "NTA, your husband is right, she\u2019s a spoiled brat", "NTA. your response was very reasonable. it\u2019s a property YOU own, and you\u2019re letting her, an adult, stay there for free. she should be nothing but grateful. welcome to adulthood, chloe. it\u2019s hard. get used to it.", "NTA. Chloe is living in your home for free, she doesn't own it and doesn't participate in paying any bills or the upkeep of the home. It is unreasonable for her to expect to have the whole apartment to herself and expect you to pay out of pocket living expenses for your other daughter who is also going to the same school.", "NTA\n\nYour assessment is correct; Chole is being an entitled brat. Next time she asks you to kick out her sister, you should tell her that if she needs more space, she can go find her own apartment.", "Oof. NTA. You\u2019re totally right and unless Lorna is being a horrific roommate, which is doesn\u2019t sound like, then Chloe is in the wrong.  I feel for her, because getting comfortable in your home and putting down roots and resisting change is super understandable and common, but it\u2019s your property and Lorna has every right to it. Hope Chloe gets over herself soon.", "NTA. Occupying solo a two bedroom apartment as an undergraduate is a rare luxury. Your daughter, however, seems to think she's entitled to it. You rightly set her straight and don't second-guess yourself on this.\n\nYou should remind her that this apartment was never intended specifically as her domicile, it was to be you and your husbands pied a terre, an opportunity you have deferred in favor of allocating a family resource to whom it is of the most use.  She obviously thinks you can afford separate housing for her sister so she is not only  trying to claim the apartment as hers,  she is trying to manipulate how you and your husband spend your money.", "NTA. Her sister has just as much of a right to stay there as her. Just cuz she's older and was there first doesn't mean she can demand stuff. She wants a WHOLE apt???", "NTA. Chloe is acting like a spoiled brat because she is one. I think you should have a talk with both girls since both need to learn to live with each other. The key is that you can't tell them what to do. They both have to want to do it. \n\nTalk to them separately about what could improve then bring them together and ask them how they can compromise on these items so both girls can be happy. Also ask them what happens if they don't do what they say they will do. What happens if Lorna doesn't clean up after herself? What happens if Chloe blasts loud movies at night? Don't threaten them. Just ask them what they think should happen if they don't follow up on their promises. \n\nRemember, don't tell them what to do. They are adults now. That won't work. And don't make any threats (kicking them out) if you are not emotionally prepared to see them through. I know you didn't do it in your post, but this thought could cross your mind if discussions get heated. The moment you set boundaries and allow them to break them without consequences, you are teaching them that your word holds little weight.", "NTA, have you checked in with Lorna to see how she is doing?  Chloe sounds toxic.", "NTA - Chloe is coming off really entitled. Many of these issues can be solved easily. \n\nTV noise? Bluetooth headphones and she can have them as loud as she wants\n\nNo study space? There are libraries for that\n\nMessy room? Don\u2019t go in there!! They are living there for free. If they each throw in $50 they can have a made in every week. \n\nI would bet my last dollar that it is actually about losing the freedom for having overnight guests without the risk of being tattled on.", "NTA at all.  If Chloe's can't stand living with her sister, then she can find somewhere else to live for free.  As my  mother told me, you have to pay the cost to be the boss.", "NTA.\n\nIf she lives under the roof that you own rent free, it\u2019s only fair that both of your daughters get the same treatment. You haven\u2019t done *anything* wrong here.\n\nIf she wants to create issues about your decision, she is 23 years old. She needs to grow up and get a big girl job and get her own house if she wants to have the luxury of making her own rules and living on her own with the price of having adult responsibilities that comes with it.\n\nStand firm. You are her parent, yes, but that doesn\u2019t ever mean your adult children can walk all over you.", "NTA Chloe needs to learn that you can't always get what you want no matter how big a tantrum she throws. Has Lorna voiced anything on the matter?", "NTA-What a sight it would be to watch Chloe move out on her own and get a job, pay rent, find an affordable place w/o roommates, and manage time for classes (like the general 23 yr old population.) She\u2019s entitled and ungrateful-she\u2019s very lucky to have a place for *free*. \n\nBut YOU are entitled to *your* property. I hope Chloe doesn\u2019t try to coerce her little sister into moving out.", "NTA\n\nChloe is acting like a brat. She can make the rules when she is paying for her own home. She doesn\u2019t get to make the rules in your home.", "She got years of living on her own, and it can be VERY hard to go back to shared accommodation after that. \nBut, she's got free accommodation and depending where she ends up employed she may not be able to find solo housing. Better to learn how to live as an adult with others now than later. \n\nAlso, NTA, you're right.", "NTA, but Chloe for sure is", "NTA.\n\nFREE APARTMENT. No bills to pay. WTF?? \n\nWelcome to the real world where things do not go as planned.", "Nta\n\nShe can deal or move out.", "NTA. You are 100% right. It's your apartment. If she's not happy she can grow up and move out. I would be so greatful to have a place to stay for free with utilities paid. Your kids are very lucky to just have to focus on school. Don't let them take advantage of you. You both seem like awesome and very reasonable parents.", "NTA\n\nBoth your daughters are very lucky they have such a nice opportunity. Chloe is acting entitled. She had the place for several years on her own which is more than Lorna had at this point.", "NTA \n\nWhat an entitled brat. You should kick her out.", "NTA. Chloe is acting like a child who doesn\u2019t understand or appreciate being able to live someplace rent free. Your husband is right, and you responded just fine.", "You are not wrong.  Your husband her father is not wrong.  Remember at the end of college you expect her to be a mature adult that can handle her own problems.  Her not talking to you is not the end of the world.\n\nNTA", "NTA. This is why so often kids raised with privledge turn into entitled brats. \n\nHaving to rent with room mates and shared spaces, chores, bills etc would do her a world of good.

Almost seems like she's hiding something and doesn't want her sister around in case she finds out?", "NTA Chloe is living in the apartment expense free, which is something many people don\u2019t have have the luxury of. You and your husband own the property, and you graciously have given her this option. It is selfish and ungrateful of her to demand that you not give your other daughter, Lorna, the same deal that that you gave Chloe. How would Chloe feel if she was the younger daughter and Lorna demanded to have the apartment to herself expense free while Chloe had to go live in a dorm. \n\nI get that Chloe has settled into the space, and that harmony she found was disrupted. But Chloe doesn\u2019t pay the bills, and she is acting very entitled and selfish towards the generosity you have shown her. \n\nIf she hates living with her sister so much, she can move out and rent her own place. Which I\u2019m sure would take some sacrifices, but Chloe got to live there on her own for two years, while Lorna has shared the space with Chloe during her entire tenancy. Chloe seems very out of touch.", "NTA! She is having a spoiled moment. I would have LOVED to have that set up in college. Would have lived with my \"annoying\" younger brothers lol. Free place is free. So yeah absolutely not. I'd call the youngest and make sure she is okay and doesn't get bullied out of the apartment. I absolutely see your oldest doing that. If that happens I'd say go ahead and have her move out too and sell the place because your oldest just it sounds like a move she will try. To push the youngest out by taking it out on her.", "NTA, Chloe is a brat. Sounds like it is time for an unannounced visit!", "NTA. You should take Chloe at her word, and press her to move out and give her sister the sweet ride she had for years. It's only fair, right? She's had years to save up money, it shouldn't be a problem.", "NTA, she is being very entitled, but you both need to go down there and talk to them in person. \n\nThe conflict is likely to get worse and there may be other reasons that they can't live together. I suspect your eldest has lost her cool pad status, can no longer bring boys around,  and none of her friends want to hang out with the younger sister. \n\nAll stuff she could absolutely do if she was living in her own place and paying market rates.", "NTA She is a brat. She thinks she is entitled to a apartment just because she is older? And she is not grateful at all that she was living there all this time rent free. I mean you two gave her a perfect start in life by giving her a place for free while she can keep and save all the money for her future. I suggest visiting apartment one day when they are both home and talking to her in person. She can coexist in same apartment or she can move out. She seems like ahe needs some hard reality how the world really is.", " NTA she's being entitled. Why is she more deserving of space then her sister? It actually may be better for her to get out and live with people. Also, is she an introvert?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

At all. \n\nBut I do understand that in the beginning it is not to easy being forced to give op parts of the space you used and the privacy you had for 2 years and start living with your younger sibling again.", "_\"..Implied that Lorna should live in dorms because she's younger.\"_ By, that logic, Chloe should be living on her own and paying her own bills since she is older. \n\nNTA OP. Chloe is acting very entitled, and if she continues her antics, you may have to firmly tell her that she either accepts the living free arrangements or she can find her own place that can meet her needs. You have been more than generous with her and she will more than likely get a shock when she researches the costs of a 2 bedroom apartment in many areas.", "NTA it's your house. But the fact you're asking this question sounds like you have enabled Chloe's behaviour to the point that you don't even realise how wrong her behaviour is", "Nta.

But the reality is that life sucks. And you just gotta suck it up sometimes.", "NTA! Looks like the compassionate mistake of wanting to see your children happy, so youve ended up giving them so much that they feel entitled to whatever they want! Its difficult and upsetting to deal with this is a parent, but in my honest opinion it will be best to stick to your original assertion. She is being a bit of a spoiled brat, and had the choice of finding a way to deal with her sister, or come up with an alternative herself.", "NTA but here\u2019s a possible solution. Tell her if she wants the apartment to herself then she\u2019ll have to pay.  Then use her rent money to pay for Lorna to get her own apartment.", "NTA\nYou gave her an option.\nI hope your other daughter is ok.", "NTA. Your daughter sounds extremely ungrateful and spoilt. Most kids get into HUGE amounts of debt in my country between paying for University/housing/everyday bills etc. Chloe doesnt appreciate the gift you as parents have given her. Both your girls have the right to stay there and if she doesnt like it she should move out. Also, dont feel bad for putting your foot down.", "NTA", "NTA.

Maybe you should tell them that if one moves out they both do, and have to pay for housing.", ">Chloe started crying and said that I should be more understanding then hung up the phone.\n\nWhy do so many people in AITA posts apparently say this when they really mean, \"you should be taking my side only.\" Being understanding or seeing something as valid is not the same thing as wholesale supporting it. A person can hate object A due to a traumatic experience sure, but that doesn't justify them policing other peoples access or involvement with object A. So it goes that Chloe, \"wanting space and a study room\" doesn't justify her being a brat.\n\nAlso, I'm to undersand this is an apartment...as in within a building with other units. Surely the other people in that building dislike her loud TV at all hours, \"just because she can\" as much as Lorna does. Sounds like Chloe just isn't good at living around other people...\n\nNTA", "NTA. Chloe is ignoring you as a power play in the hopes that it'll cause you to cave to her wishes.", "NTA", "NTA\nIn this instance but you definitely managed to raise an entitled brat. You need to meet with the two daughters, make it clear of they can't get along you will kick them both out and rent the apartment out. Time for a dose of reality for Chloe and make sure Lorna doesn't take advantage of the situation ( though it seems like she wouldn't). Chloe needs to grow up.", "YTA because you brought up your child to be an entitled brat.", "Yeah I was thinking that too. Can see Chloe trying to bully the youngest out and being very passive aggressive  about it. I mean once she graduates would push Chloe to move out so Lorna could get the privacy in the last two years.", "Yeah. Check on Lorna, and if it is as toxic as it sounds, tell Chloe she got 4 years in the apartment alone and rent-free for college, and now it is time for her to move out so Lorna gets the same treatment - 4 years in the apartment alone and rent-free for college.", "Why should the one with no complaints have to move out just because her sister is pitching a fit?", "It will ensure that one will not make the other one\u2019s life miserable w/out complaining to the parents. So if one moves out, because the quiet one is messy, plays loud music, never washes dishes and has friends over at 3:00am, she also goes\u2026 nobody wins.", "That doesn't sound like what's going on here. None of the complaints Chloe is making sound valid and it seems completely unfair to punish Lorna for Chloe's behavior."]}
