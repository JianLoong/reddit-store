{"id": 22985, "submission_id": "157vw9k", "title": "AITA for 'friendzoning' a girl after finding out she has a kid?", "selftext": "I (30m) have been trying to get back into the dating game after a recent divorce. Me and my ex do not have any kids, and I have always been adamant that I never want children (literally since I was a kid myself haha). Well as you can guess dating at 30 when you don't want kids isn't exactly easy, but I'm still drawing a line there personally. \n\nWell, on to the story. I have been casually seeing this girl (let's call her Sara) (25f) for a few weeks now. We have never been intimate in person beyond kissing and some casual touching and flirtiness. But we have had some steamy text conversations. \n\nWell the other day Sara and I decided to have a few drinks and a movie night at my place. The real agenda was for us to finally have physical intimacy, and she would stay the night. \n\nThe night is going well, and everything is great as it has been up until now. But out of nowhere Sara just casually mentions that her child's father has been a pain in the ass lately, and she is so glad she doesn't have to deal with him as a partner anymore. \n\nNaturally I was a bit caught off guard, so I asked her to clerify that she does indeed have a kid. She stated that she did, but didn't think it was relevent to us as we hadn't been seeing each other for very long. \n\nAfter she said this, I didn't quite know what to do. Of course I could have continued with the plan for intimacy, but that felt dirty now. Not because she's a mother, but because I feel like if I now have no interest in pursuing her seriously anymore, I shouldn't give her false hope by sleeping with her. \n\nI didn't quite know how to handle the situation, so when the time came to go to bed, I just kind of pretended to be too tired to do anything intimate and ended up going to sleep. She seemed visably disappointed but I didn't know what else to do. \n\nFast forward a couple of days and we haven't spoken much since, aside from casual friendly chat over text (I didn't really know what to say to her if I'm honest). Eventually she sends me a voice message saying she thinks it's pretty shitty for me to friendzone her like this just because she's a mother. That she has value beyond her child, and she deserves a 'real man' who can love her and her child. The friend that introduced us is fully on her side and being the same way towards me, despite knowing from our time as friends that I have never wanted kids. \n\nI guess I could have been upfront immediately that I think this isn't going anywhere and ended the night the moment I found out, but I felt so awkward about it all I just didn't know what to do. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\nTl;Dr found out a girl I was dating had a kid, and it turned me off. Now she's mad at me for not wanting to be romantic anymore.", "created_utc": 1690160651, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157vw9k/aita_for_friendzoning_a_girl_after_finding_out/", "score": 2874, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's fine that she's a mother, but you do not want to be with someone who has children and that is 100% your prerogative. I am a childfree woman. I would never date a man who has a child. It is not something I want in my life but I appreciate that many people do want and have kids and more power to them. It is just an incompatibility and I would never expect a man who wants children to date me.\n\nI think the onus is on the person with the child to tell someone they are seeing. But maybe she thought you guys were just casually seeing each other as a casual fling kind of thing, not dating to get into a serious relationship?\n\nGood on you for not having sex with her the moment you realised you two are incompatible.\n\nShe knows dating as a single mother is hard, which is why she conveniently didn't tell you about her kid earlier on. She can go and find a 'real man' elsewhere, lol.\n\nWas it clear from when you met that you were looking for a serious relationship?  Just message her: \"Hi, sorry for ghosting a little, but I was taken aback by the information that you have a child. I am only looking for a serious relationship and I am childfree so am not interested in dating people who are parents. If you had told me this earlier I would not have pursued a relationship with you. Good luck finding 'a real man'.\"", "NTA. my daughter 23 was asked out by m who had a child.

I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re living but it should not be that difficult to find a woman who does not have children at your age.   \n\n\nRegardless. It\u2019s never an A H move to turn anyone down for any reason. No one is owed your attention or affection. You know you don\u2019t want kids, you know you certainly don\u2019t want anyone else\u2019s. From now on you have learned that you have to ask up front if people have kids. Anyone who does is not for you. People who don\u2019t disclose and string you along until you\u2019re interested and hooked automatically go in the reject pile. I know some single parents think all they have to do is charm you enough and you\u2019ll fall in love with them and their kids. Wrong.

Not wanting children is legitimate and you\u2019re allowed to feel that way. This coming from someone who was once a single mother.\n\nETA - I don\u2019t agree that parenthood isn\u2019t relevant to new relationships.

How you handled it was crappy as you should have explained it vs avoiding the direct conversation. But it was decent of you to not sleep with her when you knew it would never work. \nI get her being hurt, but not everyone wants kids. As this is a deal breaker for you, directly asking in the first get to know you questions/dates would be better.", "NTA - it's fine for her not to introduce you to the kid, but the kid should have been mentioned sometime in the previous couple of weeks.\n\nKids are often a dealbreaker - either because someone already had them, some ody wants them and the other doesn't...etc. if you have a kid they're a huge part of your life so they should come up at some point within the first month of dating easily.", "NTA. \n\nI have a son and I\u2019m newly single.

I\u2019m sorry, from now on I will ask on the first date.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s appropriate to discuss that before getting romantic when you have such a strong preference.\n\nEdited to add: find the bar or restaurant where all the med students hang out. Statistically speaking, there should be a higher number of single, child free candidates who are also not interested in being parents.", "NTA you are allowed to set your standards. If having kids is a deal breaker then friend-zoned is exactly where she belongs. \n\nWhat's extra shitty of her is to hide the fact that she had a kid (beyond a first date that's something that should be disclosed) and then demean you when you leave. If you were really the AHole you would have hit it and quit it. Instead you realized it wasn't for you and didn't go any farther.", "NTA. She was deceptive about having a kid. For your part, it's also not easy to friendzone someone, especially for the \"you have kids and I don't want anything to do with them\" reason. Since both of you have your cards on the table now, just let it lie. However, use this as a learning experience.  From now on, be upfront with future dates on Date 1. Instead of flirting so much and figuring out when you're gonna get laid, talk about life goals, ambitions, etc. It is absolutely first date conversation - then no one gets hurt feelings or feels awkward. And you save you and the other person time and effort.", "As a single mother myself... She should have I formed you in the very beginning that she had a child.

Nothing wrong with not wanting kids. I have two and love them with every fiber of my being. I would choose them over and over again. But for some folks. Just not the jam, and that\u2019s ok. The best thing you can do is just be honest.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou can set your criteria and your boundaries.  Kudos for you for trying to be honorable about the whole thing.  \n\nI don't think friend zone is even the right move, just cut off contact.  She had friends before you came along.", "NTA. Honestly, you deciding to not sleep with her when you knew it wouldn't go anywhere is pretty great of you. You have your taste in women, and one of them is not dating women with children, and I'd guess women who *want* children. Only thing you could have done better is being more upfront, but you didn't try to lead her on afterwards so it's not like you're being totally terrible here.", "NTA, I\u2019m 22 with a kid and if I was single and dating I would be 100% upfront about that fact. You have every right to not want to date someone with kids when you don\u2019t even want kids yourself.", "NTA", "NTA she has to realize that\u2019s going to be a dealbreaker for a lot of people. It\u2019s a very reasonable dealbreaker too. The fact she just casually dropped that bomb like that like it was nothing, she sounds super entitled. I think you dodged a grenade here.", "No, she should have mentioned that small detail (a kid) up front. That's pretty major. There are going to be plenty of guys that don't mind that she has a kid. She needs to find those ones. I commend you for not sleeping with her if you don't think it can go anywhere.", "Yeah she does deserve a \u201creal man\u201d who can love her and her child. That\u2019s not you. You don\u2019t want a kid so you stopped before things went any farther, which is absolutely the right move. That seems to work out pretty nicely for everyone. I know she\u2019s upset about the relationship not moving forward but if it did it would be a mess and that\u2019s not fair to anyone, especially the child. NTA\n\nEDIT for clarity I want to emphasize \u201creal man\u201d being in quotes and clarifying that not being the one for her (and vice versa) isn\u2019t a bad thing", "OP, you are in the middle of dating hell when it comes to women that either have kids or want kids.  You are going to have to be very clear in the first date or two to make sure you state that very clearly and that no you won't change your mind. This will be very limiting for you as well and will go on till you're dating women over 40 and will still be an issue then", "NTA- \u201c said She deserves a 'real man' who can love her and her child. \u201c\n\nUm, then she should have made it clear that\u2019s what she was looking for from the beginning.\n\nShe probably thought you wanted to sleep with her bad enough to simply overlook the fact that she\u2019s been omitting having a child for the past few weeks and would just go along with things . \n\nOne could argue that you could have just come out and tell her you weren\u2019t interested in dating someone with kids instead of icing her out , but then again she wasn\u2019t very forthcoming herself, so why should you be ?\n\nNTA", "I think you did great, not sleeping with her was the right decision. And to be honest if other people are actually mad at you for this, it might be better to just cut em off because logical reasoning does not exist in their brains.", "NTA tbh but remember this is Reddit lol", "NTA. Also, props to you for not pursuing an intimate encounter with her once you found out. That was the honorable thing to do.\n\nShe was absolutely TA by not being forthright with you. When you're an adult and you have a child from a pre-existing relationship, you don't just forget to mention it to the new person you are thinking of starting a relationship with.\n\nNext time, just be clear and upfront about how you feel about kids. You're now at the age where it's perfectly reasonable to ask someone if they have kids. Or if they're married, for that matter.", "You sound like an actual decent guy.  She sounds like she doesn't know what it means to be treated with respect.  NTA.", "Nah that's a huge commitment and if you didn't put on the breaks to think about the implications that would have made you a bad partner.

Good for you on not sleeping with her since you decided it was not a romantic relationship if she had a kid instead of making that water muddier.

Don\u2019t ask if they want kids unless it comes up, but at least find out if they have them.", "NTA-you set a boundary and stuck to it before it got too far, you didn't know she had a kid and once you found out, you dialed it back and attempted to just have her as a friend instead. She and the friend are the one who are the assholes for getting upset about it, especially when the friend knew you were childfree. \n\nand the thing is, people might say that you wouldn't be bothered with the kid but i'll be honest, i highly doubt that, most of the time, parents often attempt to get their new partners more involved in their kids lives in any way, shape or form.", "Nta, but your friend who introduced you guys seems to be.

It\u2019s your (and any other 20/30something out there) decision to say yes or no to having children.  Period.   Even if the reason is .. I can\u2019t really think of one that doesn\u2019t fly.

Anxiety shuts me down sometimes.  \n\nI\u2019ve lost a friend in life bc I was too afraid to say much of anything that I thought she might disagree with while we were friends, and then got to what I thought was a breaking point in our friendship, I said wayyyyyyy tooo damnnnn much about my unspoken grievances throughout the years and, consequently, shut the door on our friendship  and bolted it shut forever.  If I could go back, I would not have unloaded like that at all.  It\u2019s hard to take the things we say back.  I could\u2019ve avoided this crap feeling I get sometimes had I just spoken up a bit more throughout the years, not just bombed her with these millions of factoids at once.

Some people don\u2019t want kids. Some people don\u2019t want step kids. Some people don\u2019t want the drama that comes from a high conflict coparenting situation. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, and honestly a person who thinks that should be overlooked has very little concern for their own child because why would you even WANT a person who doesn\u2019t want your kid (for whatever reason) to be in your kids life like that? It makes no sense. \n\nI\u2019m always on the fence about whether or not a parent (women and men) should mention kids immediately. As a parent, and a victim of child SA - some of those abusers being partners of my own mother, I always feel a single parent should utilize caution in mentioning and bringing a partner around their child. Far too many kids are abused by the partner of a parent. Not just SA but abuse in general. And many of those partners intentionally target single parents for that reason. So generally speaking, I feel it\u2019s reasonable in instances where you\u2019re specifically meeting up for a relationship (like where a previous friendship did not exist) to not mention kids immediately.\n\nBut I can also understand why that feels deceptive. No, not everyone is an abuser. In fact, the majority aren\u2019t. But at the end of the day it\u2019s still about caution. Thankfully my spouse was a friend long before a partner and knew my eldest after some time as friends. But if I were to ever become a single parent again, if I chose to date before forming a friendship (unlikely), I probably wouldn\u2019t say anything immediately.

Me and my ex do not have any kids, and I have always been adamant that I never want children (literally since I was a kid myself haha). Well as you can guess dating at 30 when you don't want kids isn't exactly easy, but I'm still drawling a line there personally. \n\nWell, on to the story. I have been casually seeing this girl (let's call her Sara) (25f) for a few weeks now. We have never been intimate in person beyond kissing and some casual touching ad flirtiness. But we have had some steamy text conversations. \n\nWell the other day Sara and I decided to have a few drinks and a movie night at my place. The real agenda was for us to finally have physical intimacy, and she would stay the night. \n\nThe night is going well, and everything is great as it has been up until now. But out of nowhere Sara just casually mentions that her child's father has been a pain in the ass lately, and she is so glad she doesn't have to deal with him as a partner anymore. \n\nNaturally I was a bit caught of guard, so I asked her to clerify that she does indeed have a kid. She stated that she did, but didn't think it was relevent to us as we hasn't been seeing each other for very long. \n\nAfter she said this, I didn't quite know what to do. Of course I could have continued with the plan for intimacy, but that felt dirty now. Not because she's a mother, but because I feel like if I now have no interest in pursuing her seriously anymore, I shouldn't give her false hope by sleeping with her. \n\nI didn't quite know how to handle the situation, so when the time came to go to bed, I just kind of pretended to be too tired to do anything intimate and ended up going to sleep. She seemed visably disappointed but I didn't know what else to do. \n\nFast forward a couple of days and we haven't spoken much since, aside from casual friendly chat over text (I didn't really know what to say to her if I'm honest). Eventually she sends me a voice message saying she thinks it's pretty shitty for me to friendzone her like this just because she's a mother. That she has value beyond her chikdren, and she deserves a 'real man' who can love her and her child. The friend that introduced us is fully on her side and being the same way towards me, despite knowing from our time as friends that I have never wanted kids. \n\nI guess I could have been upfront immediately that I think this isn't going anywhere and ended the night the moment I found out, but I felt so awkward about it all I just didn't know what to do. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\nTl;Dr found out a girl I was dating had a kid, and it turned me off. Now she's mad at me for not wanting to be romantic anymore.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I can understand why maybe she didn\u2019t want to bring it up right away, but it\u2019s your dealbreaker and you should never apologize for that.", "Info: have you been upfront with people you\u2019re dating about not wanting kids?\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to not want kids, and you never said she or her child doesn\u2019t have value. I think you did the right thing in not being intimate with her after learning this information, and that her texting you was unfair, you\u2019re allowed to want what you want in life. This person doesn\u2019t align so it makes sense to not continue. But communication is key and I think rather then not talking about it you should have been upfront and will probably need to be more upfront in the future with other potential partners. \n\nNTA.", "NTA that\u2019s a HUGE secret to keep from someone. It\u2019s fine to not want your kids MEETING the people you date until it\u2019s serious but to HIDE the existence of children from someone you\u2019re dating under false pretences is a garbage thing to do", "NAH.\n\nI understand why she feels hurt that you have lost interest in her after finding out that she\u2019s a mother. \n\nYou \ud83d\udcafhave the right to decide you don\u2019t want to pursue the relationship. You did the right thing in not becoming intimate.\n\nYou two are sadly not a match. I would be upfront early that you will not seriously date women with children and have no interest in having children (as early as you would expect a woman to disclose that she does have / wants children). \n\nI had friends whose marriage broke up over the kids issue (he wanted them / she was not sure). They were in love and happy together for around eight years until they hit their late 30s and the issue came to a head. It got pretty ugly. They divorced and on the first date with the woman who became the husband\u2019s second wife he broached the kids subject (she was an enthusiastic yes). Husband and second wife were pregnant within months and married within the year. They\u2019ve been together several years now and have two children. I\u2019ve lost touch with the first wife but I hope she\u2019s happy too. They both went through a whole lot of pain for not clarifying that important issue much much earlier in their relationship.", "NTA , her comment about needing a real man is a cheap shot. A few weeks and she doesn't say anything, she's either incredibly naive in thinking leaving out kids is ok, or purposefully deceitful.", "YTA.

She needs to understand that and probably does. Maybe she was afraid to tell you the truth ahead of time, but choices have consequences\u2014in a variety of situations. It\u2019s not fair to spring that on you and expect you to be okay with it. It\u2019s a huge deal. Whether or not you are okay with it is your choice.

If you were or weren\u2019t you\u2019re still NTA. She is for the way she let you know she has a kid. By dissing her ex? Weird. \nPS I married a divorced guy with kids at 39 \ud83e\udd2a.

With that kind of friend who needs enemies? Sheesh.", "But you didn\u2019t end it the moment you found out. Granted, that likely wouldn\u2019t change her position that you\u2019re a jerk for not wanting a step-kid, which is a perfectly acceptable position. They\u2019ll get over it. Or not.", "NTA, having to be around a kid is a responsibility. You are fine for walking away before you cross the line for commitment. You dodged a bullet, just look at the way she's guilt tripping you now.", "NTA.\n\nYou're going to feel like an AH short-term, to both of you.  But that's not the relationship you were looking for.  You've opted for short-term AH over long-term problems.\n\nShe bears the real weight here for not being up-front about that.  That really is make-or-break territory.  Unless she was just looking for something casual, that should be even more make-or-break for her than it is for you.", "NTA Dude if you're not into her just move on. It's totally fine. I'd never get with a woman with children, it's ok. You're allowed to not want to be with someone with kids.", "NTA. \n\nJust the other day there was a post from a guy who wanted to keep the fact that he had kids from potential dates for at least a year. And his comments were exhausting.. In short, he expected the woman to naturally assume he had kids (even if his profile didn't say so) and if they didn't do that, they were shallow. He showed no respect for the woman's time and went off on a friend who told him to add it into his profile to help better filter out the responses he got. He wanted to know if his response to his friend made him an AH. Looks like that guy and your date should just meet and start dating. \n\n>I shouldn't give her false hope by sleeping with her. \n\nSame as she shouldn't be pretending to not have kids to tag you along as long as she can and make sure you're attached. \n\n\n>she deserves a 'real man' who can love her and her child. \n\nNo one said she does not deserve such a man. You were just honest that that man was not you. Had she mentioned it in her profile or any time leading up to that day, you wouldn't have approached her and would have saved both of you time and energy. \n\n>pretty shitty for me to friendzone her like this just because she's a mother.\n\nIn hindsight it wasn't just that. It was also deception. She'd have had to make plans for the child when she's out with you and she gave no indication she had a child for weeks. There could be a valid reason why the partner was upset with her. She could be dumping the child on him (pure speculation on my part, but still a possibility)\n\n>The friend that introduced us is fully on her side and being the same way towards me\n\nYou really are better off without such friends setting you up. Someone ignorant of your principles and values doing this is one thing. What your friend did is a whole other kind of betrayal. What exactly did they hope to achieve..? They're probably just making wild assumptions about your boundaries now that you're divorced probably thinking \"well he won't have that many options\". You know kind of like balancing it out as greater of two wrongs. She has a kid, you're divorced. Like somehow that means you both aren't date worthy material for the kind of people you actually wanna date and should just \"settle for each other\".", "NTA \n\nYou know what you want, you made sure not to lead her on or take advance. \n\nShe may be angry now, but in the long run it\u2019s going to be much better for her & her child if she focuses on partners that like kids and could see themselves being a parent.", "Not at all. Her kid is not your responsibility. Don't be intimate with her. She may trap you and get pregnant. Set boundaries.", "NTA. You were just human and a bit awkward. Me too, buddy, me too. She was TA for speaking on your own personal boundaries for your life. That's not her business, and thank God you didn't get close enough to make it so.", "NTA. You have every right not to want to be involved with a parent. If only everyone was honest about this and was mature enough to realize that dating a parent means they are a part of a child\u2019s life and vice versa.", "You\u2019re NTA for not wanting to date someone with kids. You are an asshole for not being upfront and continuing to be \u2018friendly\u2019 via text.", "Esh. She should have told you or at the very least understood the lack of interest when you knew.\n\nThat being said you were really.immature about it. Yiu should have been upfront instead of sleeping next to her and then completely.changing your relationship", "NTA you do not want kids & she was not forthcoming with the fact she has one. If a child is alive, under 18 years old &/or still living with mom, it definitely matters & is important to mention this early on. Anyone with even average intelligence & any social skills KNOWS this! Are there times it doesn\u2019t matter? Maybe if the child is dead, put up for adoption or an adult living on his/her own, then it is \u201cnot a big deal\u201d if not mentioned until later.", "NTA", "So you should have just been honest. I was a single Mom and did totally understand if guys were not interested because of that. To be honest I wasn't interested in dating guys who had kids and I never did, I love children, but there is a lot of baggage that comes along with that. I eventually married a man with no children that loves my daughter, but I wouldn't have wanted to waste my time with a guy that wasn't capable of that.\nYou know what you want and there is nothing wrong with that. Just make it clear to others. Not everyone will appreciate your honesty, but is better for everyone in the long run.", "You're kinda the assho*e because I'm picturing her point of view .. but really, you aren't.  As long as you tell her exactly what you told us, I think it's OK. You don't want kids in your life, nothing wrong with that... It has nothing to do with her as a mother,  just something you don't have an interest in.  You could have pretended and made things worse. But, you nipped it in the bud from the get. You're going to feel bad because any normal human would,  but you're seriously doing what's in both of yall's best interests.  If it isn't going to work in the long run,  you gotta tell her before the run gets long.  Props, bro", "ETA - she should have told you upfront because kids are sometimes deal breakers for people.  Also, talking about your ex being a jerk on a date is tacky at best - but at least it resulted in relevant info being shared.\n\nOP, you should have told her immediately that you don't want kids and avoid dating parents for that reason instead of making excuses and acting weird.", "Always ask. Always!!!\n\nI found so many guys lied when I was divorced dating again and it was gross", "Totally NTA. Being a parent is an incredibly huge thing in the dating world, and is definitely something that needs to be disclosed immediately before deciding where to take things. Heck, I'm almost 37, and still have zero interest in dating men who already have kids because I don't wanna be a stepmom to someone else's kids before becoming a mother to my own kids. She knew what she was doing by keeping her kid a secret from you, and I'm sorry that you fell prey to her deceptive behavior.", "NTA.", "NTA, but she sure is. I brought up my dog on the first date with my husband but she didn't bring up her kid, ever? Your friend is the ahole  as well.", "NTA. Single parents and their kids are a package deal and you're allowed not to want kids. It's suss that single parents keep trying to date childfree people. Don't they want someone who loves their kid(s)?", "NTA. Sure, you could have sent her a text after that night, clarifying that you don\u2019t want to lead her on/continue the relationship as you are not interested in caring for a child. But it\u2019s crazy for someone to expect that someone else they are dating wants kids.", "NTA", "NTA - although I feel like you both could have communicated better. She should have mentioned it from the beginning, if you guys were spending time together. And you should have communicated to her how you felt after you found out the truth, instead of being cool towards her. \n\nI personally don't have/want kids, nor do I wish to date someone who does. So I get it. I would have felt deceived or caught off guard entirely if someone had casually mentioned it later on, so casually. \n\nAlso gotta commend you for not being intimate with her that night. Some people would have thought with their genitals and not with their brains until after they were intimate.", "Your in control of your life do not need to change who you are because of anyone els be true to yourself and if your set on something dont let anyone make you feel guilty why should you be miserable for knowing exactly what you want or don\u2019t want for that matter!!", "NTA. First of all, the friend who set you up simply went \u201cdivorced man, single mom, smooshy smooshy\u201d without considering what either of you wanted out of a relationship and I hate when friends do that. You can\u2019t throw all your single friends together and then get mad they don\u2019t work out. But thats a personal pet peeve. Second, the \u201ccasual mention\u201d that she had a kid was not casual, she threw that out there before you guys took it to the next level deliberately, hoping you\u2019d treat the information just as casually as she did so she could check off that she hadn\u2019t kept you in the dark about it while also not sitting down for an actual conversation about it. This seems like the first relationship she\u2019s tried after her ex, so dating with a kid is probably a learning curve for her, but hopefully next time she\u2019ll know not to drop that kind of bomb on a dude so cavalierly and you now know your own mind well enough to express it\u2019s a hard dealbreaker if it comes up with someone else. And tell you friend, once she cools down, that her matchmaker card with you is revoked!", "NTA. If you don\u2019t want kids, that\u2019s absolutely your choice and I see why you\u2019d pull back. \n\nShe should\u2019ve mentioned she was a mother much sooner in the courting so you could both make an informed decision on how/how not to pursue the relationships.", "NTA.\n\nThe real A here its your \"friend\".", "NAH surprised it didn't come up sooner", "NTA. She should have told you from day one. She omitted that information intentionally. You\u2019re allowed to want what you want.", "NTA. Honesty and respect are the cornerstones of any relationship.

I would respond to her message that she exactly right, she does deserve someone who will love her and her kid, and you know you can\u2019t give that to her so you are backing off to let the right man have her.", "NTA. Sara needs to get it straight in her head that there are men who do not want to be in a family with children, and that involving herself with such a man is very bad idea. Not that any guy in that position would necessarily harm her or her child, but that some men aren't as honorable as you and are, and they would exploit her and waste her time. She does deserve a man who can love both her and her child, but that man is no more of a \"real man\" than you are, who showed great character here.", "NTA I think you handled the physical situation well by not taking it further.

You could have said something along the lines of \u201coh gosh, I had no idea you had a kid. I am not interested in becoming a step-parent and I feel I might be taking advantage of you were hoping this would be a long-term relationship. We can still have fun times, but I don\u2019t want to lead you on.\u201d But dang, your friend should have known better.", "Hell no, NTA. \nYou're right to feel dirty because it was a dirty setup. \nShe was fully intent on trapping you, and it showed in her \"disappointment\" when you didn't sleep with her. \n\nTypical modern woman expecting the world to \"see her value\" while making the other party compensate for them almost entirely. \n\nNot woman hating, just calling out a dirty deal.", "NTA. And you did the right thing not taking advantage the night you knew you would end it.", "All in all, NTA. \n\nYou may have been a bit of a coward. The better\u2014but much more difficult\u2014approach would have been to be honest, something like: \u201cI like you. And I could definitely see this going somewhere. At the same time, I don\u2019t ever want kids. And that includes never wanting to be a stepdad. So I know we just started seeing each other, but I feel awkward going through with our plans for the night as I don\u2019t want to give you the idea that there\u2019s a future here when there can\u2019t be; I know I\u2019m not gonna change my mind about not wanting to be a dad.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t blame you for not stepping up that far in the moment.

It would\u2019ve been a lot less taxing to be honest with her over the phone after the fact. \n\nThat said, what\u2019s done is done.

You're N T A for not wanting kids and not wanting to pursue the relationship after finding out that she has one. But if that is such a huge deal breaker to you, then YOU were also perfectly capable of bringing it up earlier in the relationship. \n\nAll of these people blaming Sara for not saying something earlier are letting you off the hook a bit here. It sounds to me like you are pretty adamantly child free, so that should be something you discuss way earlier in the relationship as well. I mean, that used to be something the dating apps would ask you and put in your profile for matches so you wouldn't waste time to begin with so why shouldn't it be a first date kind of topic?\n\nYes, Sara also could have brought it up a bit earlier, but for her, it may not be as high of a priority as it is to you.

I am very upfront about it too. I always have been. I\u2019ve been dumped over the fact that I don\u2019t want kids. It\u2019s just life. Your friend is something else.

Actually having a child is definitely first or at latest, second date info though. People in their 20s change their minds about future children, but an existing child is a rather permanent fixture in one's life.", "I stand corrected. Either way it was early days and now they know. OP isn\u2019t an AH bit \n\n(if he doesn\u2019t want kids he\u2019d be wise to investigate a vasectomy to prevent oops and then he ends up with a kid he doesn\u2019t want)", "Cause this whole time she literally never mentioned the kid or even gave a hint that she's a mother. If you're a mom, you do know how often your kid comes up in your conversations. You have to go out of your way to avoid bringing them in your conversations.", "Makes sense to me. They were about to consummate their relationship. Both seemed pretty clear on that. Just THEN she decides to mention her kid for the first time ever after multiple dates and a lot of texting? HMM. Yes that's such a coincidence. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe was obviously trying to get a reaction, when she felt it was safe enough along that he would think she was \"worth\" it, but not too far along.", "Why not? Ben obviously isn't", "And let's not forget the cleverly timed reveal of the information. Right before sex, a major milestone in the relationship. If he said nothing and slept with her then dumped her for having kids he would have been called manipulative or an asshole for taking advantage.\n\nThat woman and OP's friend were treating this like a game. Imagine he got unit a relationship with her and this is how she handled difficult news.", "You cAn /s all you want but it definately happens", "That\u2019s a good point. I can\u2019t imagine dating anyone who didn\u2019t know I had a child. So weird.", "Having a kid is such an integral part of your life that she likely must've done some pirouetting to avoid mentioning it.\n\nSounds like she waited on purpose to give this info till he should be so expectant of sex that he would brush it off.\n\nMy guess is friend thinking they would be \"such a great match  just pretend you don't have any kid so he will get to know you first\".\n\nVery deceptive.", "Even if it wasn't malicious, it is prioritising the wrong thing (not wanting to be seen as \"just a mum\" over finding a partner who is actually compatible) and put them both in a really awkward position.", "I can\u2019t imagine going several weeks without talking about my kid. It is weird.", "Yeah that\u2019s pretty odd.", "Were you worried that your dates might abuse your son? Or maybe some Jerry McGuire type of thing where they guy was more interested in being a step dad than a husband? Or ???\n\nI don't understand guarding the fact that you had a kid.", "Yeah, friend. It\u2019s no sweat on your part. Sorry that happened to you and it came out of nowhere for you to learn that. That sucks! \n\nI definitely wasn\u2019t saying you should try it if you don\u2019t want to. Was just saying that I can see multiple aspects of it all cause I\u2019m in the dating boat around the same age. I totally get it. Hope you find who you\u2019re lookin for! And good on you for gettin back out there after a divorce and dating again. The fact you\u2019re concerned about it all is an indicator you\u2019re a pretty good catch! Good luck to you and Cheers mate!", "People disclose information when they\u2019re comfortable in doing so. I\u2019ve learned about kids and divorces, sometimes multiple divorces in varying timeframes - usually within a month of seeing somebody. There are some people that tell you all the hard things on date one, which I don\u2019t prefer. And others take some time to figure it out. \n\nI\u2019m 31 and have been dating again for the last 2 years after a terrible breakup. I\u2019d say around 20 ladies until I landed on this one. Me and her have been together for 3 months. I knew she had a kid from the get go. The first woman I really spent some time on because I really liked her, I found out she had two kids a month into it that her parents were raising. Huge red flag and I didn\u2019t see her again after I found that out.", "Me too, after my divorce and subsequent dating before I remarried, I let any potential dates know about my kiddo because she was part of the deal. If they didn't want that, I respected it. Actually appreciated the honesty before any feelings were made ya know?", "Same. And yeah lol I'm mostly subbed for the drama. They really do fucking hate kids sometimes \ud83d\ude02", "Depends on people. Most people I know after 25, they date with marriage in mind. Might not be right now but within the next 5ish years. People looking for a hook up or just to see where this goes is waste of time. So if you want kids or not are mostly first date question. Some of my friends wants kids and some don\u2019t and no point in having a second date if that doesn\u2019t align.", "What does him getting a vasectomy have to do with any of this? It's irrelevant to the story.", "Dude could be clipped. It's irrelevant to the fact that his friend hooked him up with a mom! Even if his bases are covered...that's still a situation he wants no part of.", "That you know of. There are myriad valid reasons for a parent to not make someone they barely know aware of their proximity to a small child.", "Why? Why does a person you have no expressed long-term intentions with need to know about your child?", "Whole time\u2026? Three dates? They met through a mutual. You would expect some basic knowledge passed along and so no, you aren\u2019t going to be talking about a young kid when you\u2019re trying to get to know someone. Frankly, I would advise any single parent NOT to mention their kids right off the bat to protect their kids, plenty of dudes use desperate single moms to get to kids.", "Right? I have a 4-year-old and cannot stfu about him. I can't imagine knowing getting to know anyone for a few weeks and not realizing they had a kid.", "Agreed, I just replied to another comment but I had to bring this quote up, which is my main reason for thinking she's worse than OP at the very least; \n\n>Eventually she sends me a voice message saying she thinks it's pretty shitty for me to friendzone her like this just because she's a mother. That she has value beyond her child, and she deserves a 'real man' who can love her and her child.\n\nIf she's fundamentally looking for someone who can love her and her child, then she shouldn't be advertising herself as anything other than that. That rubs me the wrong way honestly.", "I talk about my kitty nonstop!!", "The latter. Abuse is possible but I learned there is a certain type of man who views a single mom w kid as his chance to \u201cfulfill being a man\u201d and those types come on way too strong to the the entire family way too soon. If your child is older they could get this, if younger they might like the attention and then experience another loss bc do not understand how this can be a major red flag.\n\nSo as a mom of a young son who had already experienced loss, I wanted to protect him from more of it as much as possible while also being faithful to the fact I MYSELF established our home to that point after becoming single.\n\nBut secondarily if you don\u2019t know someone well you\u2026don\u2019t know them well. And any local news report will quickly show over time instances where a man uses kids to hurt a woman. If someone has left an abusive relationship to be a single mom, they likely know this and are on hyper vigilant", "Good luck to you too! And thanks for the honest insight.", "He posted he doesn\u2019t want kids, to a point of not dating someone with them. If he\u2019s dating then he won\u2019t want accidents to happen", "What's the end goal here? Children are very often a hard dealbreaker, so hiding it would be wasting her own time if it turns out the guy is a hard no on children. Put yourself in a single mother's shoes, knowing some guys are adamant about not wanting to deal with a child, wouldn't you want to know their preference before committing more of your time?", "Yes but most relationships are in the beginning and in one comment he mentions that they both had stated that they were looking for more than casual dating.", "Because when you have children that changes your whole dynamic of dating. You should let the other person know so they can make the decision if it is worth it to them. When you have kids plans change all the time. How would you like it if someone you are casually dating has to cancel at the last minute because the babysitter backed out? Or their kid got sick so they can't go to the movie with you? Say you already paid for two tickets to go somewhere and they have to cancel due to their child?  Do you understand why it's important to tell people that important part of your life?", "OP said they have been seeing each other for few weeks. This wasn't their actual \"third date\".", "It is still irrelevant.", "If we just started dating and it becomes rapidly clear our schedules don\u2019t work out then we cut our losses. Why is it specifically relevant that it\u2019s because of a kid?", "Assuming a date a week (which seems likely especially if she has a kid) a few weeks is about 3 dates.", "Because having kids is a continuous thing. You are either a child, don't have children, or never dated someone with children. And don't like and say you are one of them."]}
