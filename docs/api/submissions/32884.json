We're both adopted but we do share the same bio parents as well. My sister and I were both adopted as infants. She was placed at birth and our parents adopted her. When they learned our birth parents were expecting another kid they wanted to place for adoption they were willing to adopt me as well. My birth parents decided not to have any contact with us and to leave us no letter or anything. This is something I have always been fine with. I do not consider my birth parents my real parents or even people I need to have contact with.\n\nMy sister has always longed to know more about our birth family, the reason we were both placed for adoption, especially when we're full siblings and our birth parents were still together three years after placing her. Over the years she has talked about them and asked our parents what they know about them. Our parents didn't know much but promised to help us find answers when we were old enough if we wanted that.\n\nMy sister always had this dream that we'd do the birth family search together. However I never wanted to get involved in that. Now I'm expecting a baby and my sister has decided it's the time. She said my son could have two more grandparents if we do this. I told her I did not want to join her on the search and I would not get involved. She told me this is something we both need to do and I need to do it for my son and for all future kids so they can know where they come from and who their family is. I told her those people are not my family. I told her my family are the people we grew up with.\n\nOur parents intervened twice. They told my sister that this is a personal thing and it's important to respect each other's view points and wishes. The second time they told her they would help her search but she needs to leave me out of it unless I change my mind.\n\nMy sister tried to get my husband on her side and he told her to drop the topic. So she went back to telling me we were doing it and as someone about to become a mom I should do it and she's fucking sick of me digging in my heels. She told me a good mom would do this. Hearing that is what made me say she can't bully me into doing what she wants. She was hurt I would accuse her of bullying and told me I didn't need to be so much about all of this.\n\nMy husband and parents think what I said was fair. But I still feel so bad. My sister really took my words hard.

I am so tired of people telling moms that they are not good moms for a variety of reasons to get them to conform to their will.", "NTA, it is a personal decision and it is okay to not want what sis wants.  She has no right to pressure you into doing something you don\u2019t want.", "NTA. It's OK that you don't feel any connection to your birth parents.

Been in a similar situation (sis & I have same bio parents, bio dad let my moms 2nd husband adopt us because he didn\u2019t want to pay child support).  Bio dad had another daughter and she contacted my sister.  I was suddenly the bad guy because I wanted nothing to do with this new person.

Said it felt disrespectful to the man that raised me.\n\nTo know the bio family is a very personal decision and what\u2019s right for her isn\u2019t always what\u2019s right for you.  You can tell your sister that you support her decision to look for bio family but it doesn\u2019t feel right to you.  Pressuring you into it is wrong, same way you wouldn\u2019t demand she have a child she wasn\u2019t ready for or take a job she didn\u2019t want.

You set a clear and reasonable boundary of you not wanting to get involved while also telling her she\u2019s free to go through with it herself if she wanted. Guilt tripping and trying to strong arm you into the decision is a form of bullying.\n\nIf she had asked only once then dropped it there\u2019d be no problem, but her insistence/refusal to listen to what multiple people are telling her is a bit concerning.

You have every right to decide how you feel about this situation. What I don't get is why she's so hung up on needing you to do this with her? Why can't she just do this on her own? Is she afraid of what she's going to find out? Or is this some weird trauma-bonding thing that if the truth sucks, at least it sucks for you too? I don't understand that. \n\nI don't know how to get her to back off, if your parents and husband have all told her to leave it alone and she isn't stopping, I don't know what to suggest at this point, but know that you are not wrong in how you feel and don't let her guilt you into changing your mind for her sake.", "NTA", "She wants to learn about her \"real\" family; you don't.

You've told your sister many times now that you aren't interested, and she's using manipulation tactics to get you to do it. \n\nI've dealt with this behavior from family for a long time...I used to go along with it, but I've since learned that there is no pleasing these kinds of people. They will just keep manipulating and pushing you to do what they want you to do. \n\nKeep your ground, glad that everyone else is supportive of you and your right to say no. Your sister will either learn she needs to stop, or I would not let her be part of your life and your child's life. At least low contact.", "Nta. Plus she's honestly probably going to be crazy disappointed if she manages to find the bio, these people decided for whatever reason to leave no contact information that doesn't scream \"please come find me\" she might track them down and then be a sobbing mess because 'we were ment to be family and all they offered was relevant medical history and then said goodbye'. Like would it be good to track them down sure because you might want to know about potential cancer risks or heart disease.... But even that probably not necessary because most of those things can be tested for with other things. \nOnce sister finds those people she's going to try to steamroll them like she has you and will be disappointed when they also establish hard boundaries.

Besides sometimes thinking it would be nice to know the medical history, my siblings and I were never upset that my dad didn\u2019t search for his bio family before he had us or when we were young. Our family was the people that adopted and raised him. It is totally fine your sister wants to find them. It\u2019s not okay to try and force you or guilt you. It\u2019s a personal decision. Our situation wasn\u2019t the exact same but my dad and his brother were biologically half-brothers and were adopted at the same time when they were kids. My dad didn\u2019t have any desire to find his birth family. My uncle didn\u2019t really either, but once we were adults one of my cousins really wanted to. She ended up forcing the issue, finding the bio mother\u2019s family, and giving them our info without our knowledge. My dad eventually agreed to meet with them, but my brother\u2019s and I never have. We\u2019re satisfied with the family we had. We\u2019re fine that my cousin (and later our dad) wanted to meet them, but we hate that my cousin tried to force us into the decision. \n\nGood luck OP! Definitely not the AH. It\u2019s a decision you can only make for yourself.", "I think your sister is going to be sorely disappointed when/if she finds your birth parents.

What about the \u2018good mom\u2019 low blow? She\u2019s trying to arm twist you and ride roughshod over you. And that good mom comment was below the fucking belt. You were actually very nice considering her pushiness and strongarming. She has to understand that the two of you are two separate people, and that you\u2019re not an extension of her. You said you don\u2019t want to be in on this with her. End of story.", "NTA. This honestly sounds like a \"misery loves company,\" type situation. \n\nIf your bio parents accept you, she can brag about being right all along and how silly you were to not want this.\n\nAnd if they reject you, then you can commiserate together. But more importantly, they'd be rejecting the two of you as their children (meaning something is wrong with THEM, or maybe YOU for not wanting the connection enough to encourage it with her) rather than rejecting her alone (something is wrong with HER). \n\nWhich is why she won't do it on her own despite talking about it for years.", "NTA. You are not bullying her. She keeps harassing you. You knowing or not knowing your birth parents has NOTHING to do with whether you will be a good mom or not. She is saying shitty stuff to try and bend you to her will, if anything SHE is bullying YOU. It is a personal decision and you are not obligated to meet or know your birth parents. Full stop.", "I was also adopted as an infant and I absolutely hate when people ask me about wanting to find my biological parents. I'm like you in that I have no interest in finding them. I've realized that my \"adopted\" parents (use quotes because in no way do I see them as anything but my parents) have provided more for me in every way possible. Getting older, I've realized that my parents did an amazing job so maybe that's why I have no desire to find my biological parents. \n\nOP may have different feelings as to why they don't want to connect with their birth parents but none of them make them a bad person and no one should force them to. I feel like there's this weird notion that everyone who is adopted has some sort of trauma because of it and that finding their real parents is the only way to make them feel whole as a person and maybe that's why sister is pushing so hard.

Your sister is trying Bo bully you and when she gets the answers she I seeking you can bet she is going to share the results of her search.  I hope when this happens you will be strong enough to give your sister support  while at the same time keep yourself from being dragged into the drama that is surely to follow.  People that give up their kids usually have a pretty good reason and most likely will turn out to hurt your sister because they obviously didn\u2019t want either of you since they gave two of their children to the same family.  Your sister is wrong.  Good luck.", "[deleted]", "Oh honey, she took them hard because she is bullying you and never realized it.\n\nFor people that want to know where they come from, that urge can be overwhelming and terrifying, I think she wanted you to go along out of fear of the possible rejection.  \n\nI think she will calm down and try to talk to you rather than rail road you, for now though, you are NTA and you did nothing wrong.\n\nGood luck to both of you :)", "NTA.

She knows she's being a bully for trying to force you on this journey with her.

You are equally entitled to NOT want the same as her.\n\nShe can ask you if you want to share in the experience of searching and making contact; where she becomes the AH, and why I ended up voting NTA, is when she failed to accept your decision to not participate.  \n\nI am adopted, was adopted at birth.  I always wanted to know about my origins, my heritage, etc.  When I was pregnant with my first child, I searched for and found my bio mom.  This was before things like 23 And Me, and during a time when it wasn't so simple to just pull up info online like we can now (mid-90's).  But I found her.  I met her.  I met my two half siblings, and my half brother's wife and kids.  I met my maternal grandparents.  My bio mom actually was able to call my bio dad so I could speak to him.  My bio mom even lived with us for a time, when I was pregnant with my third child.  \n\nThe entire experience was underwhelming, to make a long story short.  My oldest is now 27, my third is 21.  I have since had a fourth child; third and fourth have never met my bio family and likely never will.  I have not had any contact with any of them since before 9/11.  I will say that I do not regret meeting any of them; had I not, I likely would have had questions my entire life.\n\nThat said, you may consider searching if only for the acquisition of medical history.  Ultimately, that was the most I got out of my experience.  However, today's DNA tests are pretty comprehensive and can provide you with most of that information on their own.  I actually did get more information from a DNA test than I did from my bio family.  So there's that.\n\nUltimately, this is nobody's decision but YOUR OWN.  Not your sister, not your parents, not some random Redditor like myself.  We all have our own thoughts and feelings on this issue, and only we can make the choice of whether or not to seek our roots, so to speak.  You are absolutely NOT a bad mom if you choose to stay out of this experience!  \n\nIt's my suggestion that you sit down with her, just the two of you.  Explain that you love her, but you just do not have the same need to find your bio parents, to get any information about them, or to have any kind of relationship with them.  Let her know that while you support her decision to pursue this, she needs to support your decision to not do so, and that if she continues to push you on the matter you will cut contact with her until she stops, because all she is doing is putting stress on you that you do not need right now.  If you are willing to aid her in the search process, offer to do so; if not, tell her you want nothing to do with any part of this experience.  Let her know that this is YOUR decision and yours alone, and that she needs to stop trying to drag anybody else into it.\n\nBe aware though; should she find them and they want a relationship, they may seek you out as well.  Think about how you might feel if this happens, and consider how you might respond to them.  It may never happen, but I am a firm believer in being prepared for any possibility.  \n\nI am not judging you for your decision, and never will.  Just because I chose to find my bio mom, just because your sister feels the need to find your bio family, does not mean you should also feel that need.  Be comfortable with your choice - while it might not be the right choice for others in similar circumstances, it IS the right choice for YOU.  Nobody else can walk in your shoes or feel what you feel.  Only YOU have the right to make choices that may impact your life or change it in some way. Nobody else.  Big hugs to you!", "NTA.

NTA and your sister's full of shit - she doesn't get to decide what you \"should\" do.", "Really curious about the \"hit dog will holler\" saying. Never heard it before, is it saying like it's the dogs fault if it gets hit so it shouldn't complain?", "Agree.  With siblings, it is probably not going to be a happy reunion.  There are exceptions, but 2 kids, something odd there.  Although my info comes from half sib adoptions (same mother) so maybe full sibs is not the adoption agency as \"birth control\" method I have heard about.", "And millions of adopted children NEVER learn their genetics, such as myself and my sister. So what? If OP doesn't want to, so what?\n\nAlso, who's to say OP's bio parents want to be known to them?\n\nGenetics are important and I wish you the best, but OP has zero personal (or maternal) obligation to do so, if that is their position. All they can do is the best for themselves and their child going forward.", "It means that if you accuse someone of something and it offends them, then it means your accusation is true. So like imagine if instead of strong arming OP, OP\u2019s sister had asked her about finding their birth parents years before, dropped if when OP said no, but asked again once she was having kids, like \u201cNow that you\u2019re having a child, have you given any thought to finding our birth parents, maybe changed your mind?\u201d And OP accused her sister of bullying her. The \u201chit dog will holler\u201d saying would say that OP\u2019s sister would not get offended, because in that case she\u2019s not bullying, she\u2019s just bringing up a question again based on changed circumstances.\n\nAnd no, it\u2019s not a good metric to go by because plenty of people can take an accusation they are 100% guilty of without getting upset and plenty of people get upset because they are falsely accused of something. It\u2019s just something people say when it happens to line up.", "I do feel for her, is she putting other life events on hold until she does this?  The problem (as I see it) is a common one with pregnancy, people around you can feel like they need to \"catch up\" in life events.  But pregnancy and newborns are a lot of work.  You, pregnant person, don't have the \"spoons\" to spare to support her from a back seat.  Some people think that pregnancy is the last chance to get something done, but the truth is it is usually well past the last chance.", "Pretty sure that in this case it was meant as \"if you act in a certain way (hitting a dog), the subject of those actions will react accordingly (the dog hollering)\"", "I have a feeling that OP's sister thinks she will be greeted with open arms and isn't remotely prepared that the very opposite may happen.", "This. And it's probably something the sister is considering too. They have never expressed any will to connect with them even after having the second baby... Honestly if she knows it too, it's even more selfish to push it on her sister who just wants to keep her peace... NTA", "she isn't being logical.", "Fellow adoptee here who recently had a child.  People have asked me didn\u2019t the experience of being pregnant make me want to know about my birth parents.  For me, it was a no.  I have wonderful parents who are the ones who raised me from birth and who are the ones I called about my pregnancy and who are making wonderful grandparents.  I\u2019m incredibly grateful for the decision my bio mom made.  Things weren\u2019t perfect, but my parents are good and loving parents and whatever else was going on I never questioned for a second that they both love me unconditionally.  (The older I get and the more I see of the world the luckier and luckier I realize I am to have that baseline love from two parents.). \n\nI don\u2019t really care about blood ties because I know my general genetic makeup and there\u2019s nothing terribly special, unique etc that makes it compelling for me to seek out.  My mom also met my bio mom and they spent time together in the hospital, so I feel like I have enough vicarious connection and knowledge of the situation without needing direct contact.\n\nMy cousin who was also adopted at birth had the opposite experience and had an almost physical calling to find her birth parents when she was pregnant. That\u2019s okay, too.\n\nMy brother (adopted at an older age, no biological relation which I only mention to explain the context) knew his mom and his older bio sibling and sought them out as a teen.  I was angry about this because I thought it pushed our mom aside, but our mom supported him in trying to re-connect and I never voiced my anger to him largely based on our mom\u2019s explanation.  She said if it results in more people in his life who love him, great.  If not, at least maybe he\u2019ll feel like he has some more understanding about how he ended up with us and that might give him some peace.  It was messy and did not result in a long-term reunion and it took a long time for my brother to work through it.\nBut my mom and brother and I are still close and maybe even closer for making it through the other side.\n\nAll this to say, I think my family has run the gamut of different wants and needs as adoptees.  Both you and your sister\u2019s choices are valid but you are absolutely correct that she is bullying you.  You are NTA. And her stated reasons are emotional manipulation at worst and misguided at best.  None of you know what the result of opening that door is, and the promise of \u201cmore grandparents\u201d is the wrong reason to open it, in my mind.  But I\u2019m torn about your sister because I think she\u2019s handling things poorly and being TA to you, but it\u2019s also likely rooted in a lot of fear, inability to fully identify/process her own emotions and an assumption that you would automatically feel the same way as her.  So now she\u2019s lashing out because she doesn\u2019t have her automatic support person in this journey (in her mind, not saying you owe that) and she doesn\u2019t have the ability to shortcut the emotional process with someone who \u201cunderstands\u201d. (Again, her problem not yours but I can at least sympathize with her angst.)\n\nWould you consider doing a family therapy session with your sister or with your sister and your parents?  Not because I think YOU need it, but because if she\u2019s going to go down this road you\u2019ll need to establish your own boundaries (and your parents might need to, too) and make sure she\u2019s hearing them and understand the potential consequences if she violates them.  She may also need some gentle guidance and prodding from a professional about her own motives, hopes, etc. and making sure she untangles that from whatever your decision is and hopefully do some honest processing about all of the potential outcomes before she decides. \n\nAnd if she decides to kick open that door even without you she will need support separate from you and your parents to sort out her feelings about whatever she encounters in a healthy way.  I think my mom was a saint in the way she showed unconditional love to my brother during his attempts to reconnect with his bio mom but I\u2019m sure she had her own complicated feelings about the situation.  Your parents also sound wonderful, but your family may need some support navigating each of your own feelings on an individual level in order to be supportive of each other.  Your sister is not wrong for wanting to seek out that connection, but she\u2019s young and misguided in her approach.  She will be TA if she doesn\u2019t take into account that her decision will not be made in a vacuum and impacts all four of you in a very fundamental way regardless of each individual\u2019s states level of participation in the process.  \n\nI think it would be wonderful for all four of you to come to a shared framework of how to navigate the process from the assumption that your sister will seek out your bio parents.  You can show her that you support her decision to the extent that you\u2019re not going to talk her out of it, but I think addressing some of the thornier potential issues before the cat\u2019s out of the bag will help you all protect your individual needs while simultaneously (hopefully) helping your sister make a more informed decision not only about wether to move forward at all, and if so, identify and work through some potential challenges before they are fraught with more motion.  I would love to hear an update that she has a counselor familiar with adoption with whom she\u2019s processing all of this a) for your sake, OP.  If you don\u2019t want to go down this road you shouldn\u2019t be expected to be a support person if you can\u2019t/don\u2019t want to be and b) because even best case scenario your sister (if not all of you) will experience a seismic shift in your current family dynamic and c) I want her to have the tools to protect herself and process whatever comes from this the more work she can do upfront the better prepared she\u2019ll be.  \n\nOP I wish you and your family nothing but the best.  I hope you are able to protect your own peace and I hope your sister can get some help processing her own feelings without being TA to you in the process.", ">She told me this is something we both need to do and I need to do it for my son \n\nHer wants are not your needs.  NTA.\n\n>My sister really took my words hard.\n\nNot your problem.  She brought it on herself.", "NTA\n\nShe can pursue it on her own.  A possible benefit would be to be aware of biological health issues....***if*** both are located.", "She took your words hard because she was bullying you.\n\nNTA", "I think it would be fair to get medical histories if possible so maybe tell her you'd like that information but no more and that might placate her some into letting you be, but NTA for telling her you're not interested in anything further. \n\nI say medical because at the age of 58 I just found out who my father is and from the half siblings some medical information that could be helpful to me.  And I have no kids.  With kids it would have been important.  So I would not turn that down if I were you.", "NTA. My kids are both adopted, similar to your case where both were infants, and we adopted one then the other when they were born. I\u2019m it clear in the circumstances of your adoption. In my case, it was from foster care after an involuntary termination of parental rights. Both of my kids know they are adopted but have only known our family. I answer their questions in an age appropriate manner, and someday, when they\u2019re old enough they\u2019ll more or less get the whole story and I guess my help in contacting the birth parents if they want and it\u2019s safe. One of my kids has questions about the bio parents, the other has never asked anything. \n\nAll of this is a long way of saying- it\u2019s complicated and I can see both you and your sister having legit reasons for what you want to do. I don\u2019t think either of you is wrong here, but I have a strong suspicion your sister has romanticized things and is setting herself up for disappointment. Where your sister is wrong is trying to bully you into doing what she wants. If she wants to meet the bio parents, that\u2019s fine, but if you don\u2019t want to, that\u2019s fine too, and she shouldn\u2019t try to force your hand", "NTA\n\nShe's a bully and she's going to have to let go of her fantasy reunion with her \"real\" parents.", ">She told me a good mom would do this.\n\nOnce she said this I would've seen RED. NTA.", "A good sister would respect your wishes and stop harranguing you over this need of hers to find your birth parents.  You're not interested.

She may not be bullying, but she\u2019s trying to impose her will and beliefs on you. She isn\u2019t respecting your lack of interest in this. You aren\u2019t trying to stop her doing what she wants, you just don\u2019t want to be included. She needs to leave you out of these plans or it will affect your relationship. \n\nMake it clear - this is her battle. You want nothing to do with it, and even if she finds them you don\u2019t want to know about them or meet them, period. She either needs to accept your wishes or back off.", "NTA\n\nShe was bullying you. She can't see it because she's so caught up in how important it all seems to her. I see where she's probably coming from. She had a drive to know about her bio family and history. She's expecting that everyone including the new baby will have that drive. I am a person with that drive and it was super hard for me to understand that other people don't. Sister should work this out in therapy and do her search. But she also needs to respect your boundaries.", "NTA \n\nPlus you\u2019re pregnant. For gods sake. You don\u2019t need this extra stress", "NTA. She doesnt get to force you into doing something only she feels strongly about and then get upset with you call her out on it.

She\u2019s trying to force you to do something you don\u2019t want to do with emotional manipulation.  That\u2019s unacceptable.  If SHE needs to find out about her birth parents, SHE can.  She doesn\u2019t need your participation, and trying to make you feel like a bad parent for refusing to help her is only going to lead to her having less family contact, not more, since her harassment will probably only be the first step in the campaign to reunite you with your bio donors.  If she finds them, she\u2019ll want you to come with her to meet them.  Then she\u2019ll want your children to consider them grandparents, and she\u2019ll invite them to all family events.  You need to make it crystal clear right now that her quest to know her biological progenitors is hers alone, and that if she can\u2019t drop it, you\u2019ll be limiting contact with her, as well.", "NTA. Your sister can search for her own sake, but she doesn't get to treat you (or your future child) like you're some sort of package deal/happy family fantasy as she searches for the bios. There is an added complexity of the fact that you and your sister have no way of knowing what she will find, if/when she uncovers the biological family. They may not wish contact. They may not be people you wish to have contact *with.* There are so many variables there and there's absolutely no guarantee that it will be someone you go \"Oh yes what a lovely addition to my family\" *even if you were inclined to reach out to them - which you are not, so this should not even be relevant but your sister is putting the cart before the horse.*\n\nYour sister is trying to steamroll you into doing what she wants, when she wants, exactly as she wants.

You have every right to determine who you do and do not want in your life and who you do, and do not consider family!\n\nMy sister and I are both adopted children, and more than a decade older than you. I will share this: I have no desire to reach out to my bio family. Neither does my sister. We actually have the opportunity, should we wish (adoption agency could facilitate) but there is no interest on our part. While I can respect the complex circumstances that result in individuals putting a child up for adoption, as the adopted child I can say - I know *exactly* who my parents are, and it's not the individuals who contributed DNA to my conception. I have felt this way since I was a teenager, and it hasn't changed. I understand other adoptive children may view things differently and I can respect that - but in the same vein, my feelings and my perspective (and yours!) are just as valid and no one gets to tell you how you should feel or act.\n\nIt is intensely personal and should be a decision left up to each individual, as to what feels right for them.\n\nSending you love and support in this. I'm sorry your sister isn't being as supportive as she should be.", "NTA absolutely no. I'm adopted. I was the only 1 out of the 4 that was given up. We had an open adoption and my parents left my bio family the option to be in my life- only my great grandparents and littlest brother actually tried.

You're not her emotional support animal, you're her sister and an autonomous individual who deserves to be heard and respected. \n\nI can want shared experiences with all kinds of people, but unless they want that too, I have no right to demand it. The same goes for your sister. Unless you are happy to go along with her plans, she has no right to coerce you or try to get your husband to convince you to do what she wants.", "I would also suggest OP have a solid management plan in place for the if sister finds BPs. I just can't help but think she may become even less respectful of your boundaries. And who knows what kinda people THEY could turn out to be?! You'll want to be as clear as possible with sis that it isn't up to her who gets invited into your life, and unfortunately, if your BPs aren't a presence you want in your life, you may end up having to go low or no contact with sis if she gets carried away, which sounds like she might tend to do...
