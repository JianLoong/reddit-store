They are not biologically my kids, our daughter (7) is however. For Christmas we bought them the Switch. To be clear, it was for all three and they opened it together. This was their first gaming console. All the games we purchased had multiplayer function, we also gave each kid their own controller. \n\nChristmas day things were fine, they all played together for hours. The day after, life resumed. My wife flew out to her dad\u2019s for his surgery. As I went to work each day, both older kids were to keep an eye out for the youngest during the remainder of Christmas break. \n\nI\u2019d come home from work to find the two playing, while the youngest sat quietly, obviously upset though. I\u2019d ask why isn\u2019t the youngest playing as well? I would responses like, \u201cIn a minute\u201d or \u201cThis level is too hard for her.\u201d Most the time, they\u2019d give me a bunch of hot air without a definite reason. One evening a huge fight broke out after the two paused the game and walked away. The youngest determined it was finally her turn. When they found her, all hell broke loose. I took the console away, the next day I told them they could have it back when they agree to let their sister play. \n\nSeveral days later I come home and find the youngest in her room crying. They made her do all their chores, in return she would be given 15 minutes to play the game. Only, they didn\u2019t hold up their end of the deal after she completed the chores. I discovered this wasn\u2019t an isolated incident. They have been bossing her around everyday, and using the console to manipulate her. I was livid, this was a gift intended for everyone. She shouldn\u2019t have to earn her time to play, and then be given a ridiculous time restraint. \n\nI took the console away completely, but realized later this wasn\u2019t fair for the youngest who did nothing wrong. I decided to buy her a system, just for her. I saw this being the only fix to eliminate the problem. The older kids got their system back and I explained their sister now has her own. Everyone seemed fine, things in my opinion worked out great. \n\nThat was until my wife returned home. The older kids told her how I\u2019ve shown obvious favoritism for the youngest. They don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair the younger gets to have a console to herself, and in her bedroom. Their console has been in the living room since Christmas morning. They argued they should each have their own consoles so they can have them in their separate rooms too. To be clear, the youngest needs her system in her room or it would defeat the purpose of buying another one since the other kids use the living room tv. \n\nEven after explaining to my wife what had happened, she agreed it was a form of favoritism and that I should have made the rule all three play or none at all. Like as if they\u2019d actually obey that rule when I wasn\u2019t home. Currently, they\u2019re barely speaking to me and said to fix things I should buy a third console. I\u2019m kicking myself for buying the first one.\n\nETA: I\u2019m not sure why so many are baffled over the fact that the older kids were asked to \u2018keep an eye out\u2019 for the youngest. That simply meant, as they know, call if there\u2019s a problem and I\u2019ll be right there.

After trying to get them to play fair, I ended up removing the console but had the idea to buy another one specifically for the youngest just to stop the fighting. This appeared to be the ultimate fix, until the older kids told their mother I was only showing favoritism and should buy a third console so everyone would have their own. She agreed I showed favoritism, adding that I didn\u2019t handle things properly.

Being unwise doesn't make you an AH. Buying the console for the youngest may have been a bit trigger-happy, and discussing it with your wife first may have been better.

If anyone is showing favoritism, it\u2019s her, when she chooses to excuse their bad behavior toward your daughter.\n\nThe idea that you should have to reward your step kids for their bullying by buying yet another console is absolutely ridiculous. Tell her to buy it herself if she really thinks they deserve to be rewarded for their bad behavior.\n\nI applaud you for standing up for your child and not allowing her to be bullied.

It's not entirely on the teens.", "\"They were to keep an eye out for her\"\n\nThey were watching her, they were babysitting her. No matter how you want to put it you left the 2 in charge", "Not sure where you live, but you generally can't leave a child that young without supervision. That's abandonment. The older kids couldn't go hang out at their friends houses, correct? Their vacation was taken away - no sleepovers or whatever their friends got to do all week. So yes, they were babysitting. They were probably resentful of the unpaid duty (parentification?) as well. YTA for this alone.", "\"When someone shows you who they are, gaslight them.\" Lol\n\n\"Gaslighting\" is now like a wild card that means 'whatever I say it means'.\n\n\"Parentification\" is quickly vanishing down the same toilet.", "Smh, so you may be an only child or never had to babysit siblings, lucky you, but there are plenty of families that's do and dont pay their children for it, so they had to watch their younger sibling so what", "If by \"babysitting\" you mean forcing her to do chores while play video games all day lol", "How tf is telling the older step children to look after the younger one bullying? I\u2019m the oldest sibling in my family and I get given the responsibility to look after my younger siblings when my parents are away on occasion, but it\u2019s not bullying, it is just passing the responsibility to the older sibling (me) for one day so that the younger ones don\u2019t get hurt/ do something dangerous", "They didn't watch her, they forced her to do chores while they played video games", "It is learning. That's life. Life's not fair, but it can be made fair if there is conflict resolution and compromise. If they are not allowing time how the unit is divided up could be changed. \n\nAn extra unit will be a problem later when the two break theirs and take the youngest. Games etc. It at best buys you time. \n\nBetter solution, give the youngest ownership of all the games, so that if they bogart the unit, they can take thier game back and playtime is over. Give the console to one and the charger to the last. They must find compromise in order for the unit to work. Without the three parts, the unit will be useless. \n\nThere are ways... of teaching people to be more selfless.", "Bullies need supervision. OP left them in charge.", "It's a Reddit thing. The second you ask an older child to look after a younger one people flip out and say you're an abuser. It's ludicrous. My 16 year old watching my 12 year old when he's going to be home anyway and they will both be playing video games in separate rooms all night isn't parentification or abuse. It's him being the responsible party in case of emergency, nothing more.", "Yeah i have 4 siblings. My siblings did the same but they would let me actually play after that and they would play with him without me doing chores. Some kids are shitty and some not. They are 12 and 14, they should really know better. His wife is clearly showing favoritism and if he don\u2019t have a serious talk with her wife about it and just want to make her happy  then yeah he is stuck. Because he didn\u2019t really did something wrong", "Kids are going to kid and working parents aren\u2019t perfect. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You\u2019re wrong. You don\u2019t know the dynamic and you\u2019re really reading so far into things.", "Where are my fellow Gen-X latchkey kids at? We're snickering at this discussion.", "No it\u2019s not. It\u2019s completely normal for older kids to watch their younger siblings even when a parent is at work.", "Like I already said, just because other families do it doesn\u2019t make it right. The younger child isn\u2019t their responsibility. There are also other families that compensate their older children for watching the children that the parents decided to have.", "... because they might resent her? This incident doesn't exist in a vaccum. Having 1 1/2 weeks of winter break left and being told you have to stay home to not-be-responsible for your little sibling sucks.", "Ye I did too after a little torture. I wasn't a shitty brother though as he came everywhere with me and learnt to wrench better than I ever could. He found his calling. He was fixing my bikes when he was 13 an now runs his own garage.... lil bastard haha", "That's true and I know life happens. The mom's visit was clearly unplanned. I just think it's unfair to put all the blame on the teens, they severely misbehaved but in the end it is OP's responsibility to protect and care for the kids and he dropped the ball somewhere too. This situation was a set up to fail.", "Okay, so you left a 7 year old home with no one in charge and no one responsible for her while you went to work?", "Tomayto tomato and like I said their are fams that don't compensate, if i tell my son he is babysitting, he is doing it, and i dont have to pay him a damn thing, he's going to do it because i told him to, period, sorry you dont understand that concept, that's how it is in some families, sometimes it's not about what you want to do but what you have to do you don't have to like it, it is what it is, good day to you", "Lol this is entirely the kids being dicks to each other, a thing siblings do (citation: self), yes parents need to parent, and the OP clearly did.", "Yep.", "\u201cDo it because I said so\u201d is a great way to deteriorate a relationship with a kid. Kids aren\u2019t servants. Have a great day.", "I agree with OP's parenting choices _after more that two weeks_.", "So you're a bad parent and should probably get your kid taken away. You can't leave a 7 year old home without someone to watch them", "I was babysitting other peoples kids when I was 11 those kids are old enough to stay home and keep an eye on her.", "Nope, per state laws we did nothing wrong."]}
