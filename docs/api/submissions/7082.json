They are not biologically my kids, our daughter (7) is however. For Christmas we bought them the Switch. To be clear, it was for all three and they opened it together. This was their first gaming console. All the games we purchased had multiplayer function, we also gave each kid their own controller. \n\nChristmas day things were fine, they all played together for hours. The day after, life resumed. My wife flew out to her dad\u2019s for his surgery. As I went to work each day, both older kids were to keep an eye out for the youngest during the remainder of Christmas break. \n\nI\u2019d come home from work to find the two playing, while the youngest sat quietly, obviously upset though. I\u2019d ask why isn\u2019t the youngest playing as well? I would responses like, \u201cIn a minute\u201d or \u201cThis level is too hard for her.\u201d Most the time, they\u2019d give me a bunch of hot air without a definite reason. One evening a huge fight broke out after the two paused the game and walked away. The youngest determined it was finally her turn. When they found her, all hell broke loose. I took the console away, the next day I told them they could have it back when they agree to let their sister play. \n\nSeveral days later I come home and find the youngest in her room crying. They made her do all their chores, in return she would be given 15 minutes to play the game. Only, they didn\u2019t hold up their end of the deal after she completed the chores. I discovered this wasn\u2019t an isolated incident. They have been bossing her around everyday, and using the console to manipulate her. I was livid, this was a gift intended for everyone. She shouldn\u2019t have to earn her time to play, and then be given a ridiculous time restraint. \n\nI took the console away completely, but realized later this wasn\u2019t fair for the youngest who did nothing wrong. I decided to buy her a system, just for her. I saw this being the only fix to eliminate the problem. The older kids got their system back and I explained their sister now has her own. Everyone seemed fine, things in my opinion worked out great. \n\nThat was until my wife returned home. The older kids told her how I\u2019ve shown obvious favoritism for the youngest. They don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair the younger gets to have a console to herself, and in her bedroom. Their console has been in the living room since Christmas morning. They argued they should each have their own consoles so they can have them in their separate rooms too. To be clear, the youngest needs her system in her room or it would defeat the purpose of buying another one since the other kids use the living room tv. \n\nEven after explaining to my wife what had happened, she agreed it was a form of favoritism and that I should have made the rule all three play or none at all. Like as if they\u2019d actually obey that rule when I wasn\u2019t home. Currently, they\u2019re barely speaking to me and said to fix things I should buy a third console. I\u2019m kicking myself for buying the first one.\n\nETA: I\u2019m not sure why so many are baffled over the fact that the older kids were asked to \u2018keep an eye out\u2019 for the youngest. That simply meant, as they know, call if there\u2019s a problem and I\u2019ll be right there.

If you had put it in her room they could say favoritism but you can then say this was the consequence for making her do chores to get 15 minutes of play time while you were away. I honestly see this as a no win situation for you but if it was only one in her room I bet they would have found a way to share and play with her.

There is a 5-7 year age gap in the kids; they aren\u2019t always going to want to play the same games together or play equally because the youngest is so much younger. But they definitely crossed a line by manipulating her by saying she had to do their chores then lying. It was extremely cruel.\n\nBut here is where I have a problem: You made a massive unilateral decisions without talking to your wife first. You should have waited until she got home and discussed it with her so you would both be on the same page, a united front, and she could offer her insight on how to resolve this situation. Now this is a no-win scenario. She and the two oldest will see it as favoritism if you only allow the youngest to have a personal console, and the youngest will feel as if she is being punished if you take it from her. I think your only option now is to get the third console.\n\nI don\u2019t feel comfortable saying you\u2019re TA or not TA since your heart was in the right place, and you had all the best intentions to make things right after the youngest was bullied, but you should have talked to your wife first. That was your mistake, and again, I think you were incredibly naive NOT to realize it would look like favoritism when kids are already hyper aware of that kind of thing, especially when you\u2019re the step parent.", "NTA for buying your 7yo an extra system.  \n\nHowever you should stop leaving your 7yo with her much older brothers when all they do is bully her. \nBrothers should have to do all her chores for a month and have no access to any gaming systems for that time.", "Those 2 kids are very selfish.  You could just take the console away when you're not  home & when you are home give them limits.", "Not that it makes it ok but there's a good chance a 7 year old is significantly worse at the games and it would be very frustrating for them.", "The sad thing is, 7 yo would probably prefer to play with her older siblings instead of in her room alone. Maybe the compromise is that they can play with her in her room if they want to play switch in a bedroom. So, maybe one older kid is playing an advanced game in the living room and another is playing with little sister in her room.\n\nETA: NTA", "Lmao. I cant believe you think that most 7 year olds are on par with a 16 year old in games. Stop it. If the 16-year-old was playing since they were a kid. They dust the 7 year old with their eyes closed. You're delusional to think otherwise. What hobby would this NOT be true in???", "They weren't even watching her, only supposed to call OP if something happened ie not proper babysitting", "It wasn't just the switch and them not letting her play, but she was doing all the chores and mom did nothing to address this issue.   The switch is just the tip of the iceberg.", "That\u2019s the issue. The mother. But then what do you do with one console. If you take theirs away, they still bully the little girl, mother won\u2019t do anything and now everyone wants a third console. Even OP wishes he hasn\u2019t bought a first one so maybe he should get rid of them. Older kids will be out of the house in a few years. In the meantime, he can buy something that can be locked away more easily like a switch for the youngest. It can be an unpleasant lesson about selfishness for the older two. But if you have a better idea, I am definitely open to hearing it because I can\u2019t think of an alternative that doesn\u2019t involve a more involved wife and he doesn\u2019t have that with her.", ">Some games are hours long but even league games are well over 40 minutes often. I doubt they have the attention span.\n\nTell me you never played videogames when you were a kid without telling me you never played videogames when you were a kid. Kids that age can end a small game in a single session (I know me and my brother did).\n\n>Sure give em a shitty shooter or Mario kart or something they\u2019ll be fine as long as they got some dexterity in their hands. Even a strategy shooter like valorant theyd struggle a lot with.\n\nYet the recordist for the youngest gaming professional ever was a 7 y old Halo player that started competing when he was 4. There's also at least a Fortnite player that signed a contract when he was 8. 8 y old SSB tournament winner, also a thing.\n\nIt's not rocket science.", "It may be unrealistic to expect the older siblings to play *with* their younger sister constantly, but they are old enough to understand giving her a fair turn. It's a common enough conflict, but parents aren't wrong to expect sharing of expensive consoles. It's not really comparable to a car because it's a toy not a means of transport, but families do share those when it's necessary.", "they can be when they want to. oldest 2 have their share of fights often but when it comes to video gaming they are best buddies lol", "I was taken aback that the older siblings were not punished for the bullying, in fact the console (the tool of their bullying) was RETURNED to them and they had not apologized but rather accused stepfather of favoritism?! This behavior is troubling. I agree with the babysitter suggestion and I would have taken the console away as it seemed to bring out the worst in them. OP should not have expected three kids to share a switch, such sweet naivete... .", "My boys are 6 and 8 and both have loads of games they can play by themselves.", "Exactly, when i was 14 i thought i was an adult i was smoking weed and stuff. I could handle supervising my little sister for the day like jeez", "These commenters who think this is so terrible clearly didn't grow up pre-1995 haha", "Got two younger sisters and three older brothers. Sisters are half, brothers are not. I only mention it when people react funny when i say their mother and not our mother, especially in the context from our dad.", "Absolutely! I know it's not a gaming device, but I read on the news since time ago that some kids bought $7k worth of toys on an Alexa, so just imagine what could happen on a console.", "I agree with you that the issue is the older kids not allowing the younger kid to play. But i think you missed the point of the comment you're replying to.\n\nThere are some games where allowing the 7 year old to pick it up in the middle of a level will actively destroy progress. Don't think it's as bad as it used to be - when i was a kid i remember the mario game for gameboy you'd get sent all the way back to the beginning, deleting all progress, i feel like games now would just send you back to the beginning of the level. But still, it makes sense that \\*at times\\* letting the 7 year old play would actively hurt the other kids progress.\n\n( I could also see a kid ruining a level up or wasting important items before an autosave)\n\nIt is not an excuse for them not letting the 7 year old play at all, it's not manufacturing an issue to justify the kids bullying the younger sister. it could \\*explain\\* some behavior \\*in the moment\\* without condoning or justifying it. \n\nThe kids should absolutely be more mature than that and should be able to figure out how to put the kid on a different game or different save file so that she doesn't ruin progress, the comment you replied to never argued any differently", "Yeah my brother and I would stay home alone for school holidays all the time. He\u2019s older by 2 years (but I was definitely the more responsible one lol), but it was mostly \u2018make sure your sibling doesn\u2019t set fire to anything, call me if there\u2019s blood and don\u2019t let them drown in the pool\u2019. We actually got along great, some days we\u2019d do stuff together all day, some days we wouldn\u2019t see each other at all haha", "One of the stories that comes up every year in my data protection training is the mum who went to work one day, had her card declined for some small purchase. When she checked her bank a lot of money had gone out. Turns out her son and his girlfriend decided to buy a car on EBay and she\u2019d left her account open at home. I think she was able to get the money back but more and more often we\u2019re seeing kids cleaning their parent\u2019s bank accounts out with the companies responsible refusing to refund the money as parental controls weren\u2019t in place.", "I agree that they're probably not fighting each other yet because they're close enough in age to enjoy the same games, but they're also old enough to know how to take turns. They don't need to play their sister's little kid games. They need to give her an equal amount of time on the console. \n\nBut OP didn't have to buy another one. A switch is very portable. If you're worried the kids won't respect the rules or will play it even when grounded because you're out of the house, you can easily remove it while you work on a solution, whether that's grounding, giving them tit-for-tat on what it's like to be promised time but only given 15 minutes, working out a schedule so there isn't any time-slippage, etc.", "Bingo.  OP is an AH for expecting kids this age to act like mature clear thinking adults unsupervised for days and days.  Especially over a  holiday break and a new console in the mix.  Ridiculous.  There is a reason adulthood starts later.", "This is def a possibility but based on the story these kids are manipulative little shits and they know exactly what they're doing. They need discipline, and clearly to be refreshed in some right and wrong.", "Bruh i got left home alone when i was like 8, by the time i was 12 i was being paid to babysit other neighborhood kids. I think your ages are way off, though OP's step children do seem very immature and maybe they shouldnt be left home alone", "Tbh I think the whole situation should have been handled a bit differently but I understand that this is what he thought was best so I don't think he's an AH for solving the problem this way. I'm not sure how long Mom was gone after the last incedent that sent him out to buy the second console but it probably would have been a good idea to call mom and see what she thought of the situation before doing that. I think together they would have come up with a better option or the same thing OP did and they'd be on the same page about it.. As it stands she came home from a stressful situation to 2 kids upset, likely twisting the situation, claiming dad is showing favoritism, a 7yo that probably feels like she has done something wrong, and a husband that is probably exasperated. Including her in the discussion could have made all the difference. \n\nI personally don't see a very good way forward now unless mom gets her head out of her ass. I do stick by my thoughts that the older kids would be even worse to the little sister even if both consoles are taken back, they will blame her (even though it would be their fault), and this could cause an even bigger rift between the kids than the age gap and having a different dad already has. Right now Dad just needs to stand firm, ask his wife what she thought he should have done with no one there during the day to enforce what he had told them in the first place and that if she wants them to have another console she will be providing the money for it because he isn't going to reward bullies or punish the victim of bullying trying to teach the bullies a lesson that they still won't learn. The only way this situation gets better and the older kids learn their lesson is for Mom and Dad to get on the same page. \n\nSince the mother is back and should be able to control the bullying I guess they could compromise. Put the younger child's console up atm, ground the older two for a while and make them do their chores and the youngest's too. Once they are no longer grounded Mom can regulate the time spent on the console for all of them, if the older two manage this without being mean they can take the other console back or sell it, if not the youngest gets her console back and the older two can stfu because they are clearly ungrateful little shits.. Idk I don't have a better solution, I just don't think punishing the youngest along with the older is the right move..", "I'd just take the damn console to work with me until they could all learn to share. They'd only get to play it once I got home from work.", "Long term the solution is scheduled and limited play, and children should only be allowed limited play anyways. You make the rule that everyone gets a turn for one hour 4 times per week or something like that and if there is a problem with people claiming the same hours you add a schedule.", "How is OP going to enforce the second switch being for the youngest? They could just take that from her room just as well.", "And where would that leave the 7yrold? With 2 older siblings that were pissed and would take it out on her.", "The switch even has parental control settings where you can limit play time! It's super easy to set up. If all the kids have different profiles, you can just set it to an hour a day for each of them. Problem solved (without buying a whole new switch!)", "It's called a locked door. Thanks for playing.", "My dad has 2 much younger half-brothers from his step-mom and has always called them his brothers, it took me being a late teen to realize that they were technically his 1/2 siblings.", "Yeah, I have always considered my older sister, my sister, even though she has a different father.  I remember one time when I was a kid and learned about 1/2 siblings, I put two and two together and said to my dad, so K is my half-sister?  ooooh did he get mad.  He didn't yell at me, but his demeanor changed so quickly and he just said K is your sister.", "Possibly... they're definitely bullies. But buying three consoles as others have suggested isn't the answer either. He probably should just have taken it away until school starts, that way they can only play it in the evening when the parents are home"]}
