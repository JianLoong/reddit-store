And if something \"grounding worthy\" happens. You are to tell the parents either right away or at hand off, depending on the severity. My 3 niece's knew, that while I was fun/crazy Aunty.

You're doing exactly what you should when a child has a tantrum, you don't invalidate their feelings, but you don't engage either, then make them aware that it's okay to feel, but not to hurt other people/things.\n\nMacca's is full of sugar and you were in a highly stimulating environment, it might be worth being a little less \"fun\" to see if that stabilises his behaviour a bit.", ">When my mum came to pick him up the next day i told her about it and she got pissed.

Ignoring a tantrum happening is actually a legitimate method that actually works when a child realizes that their screaming and crying won't get them what they want. A refusal to engage is essentially neither negative nor positive attention, and attention is generally what is desired during a tantrum.\n\nNTA", "This is exactly how I worked out my nephew\u2019s contrary period.

No yelling or fighting, and 20 minutes later he\u2019d cleaned a good part of his room, and I helped him finish.
