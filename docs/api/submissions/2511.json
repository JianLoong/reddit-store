But there's not avoiding it and the anxiety you're feeling because you haven't told her is going to get worse. I can't tell you how she will react, but there's a good chance that the two of you can work through this. Couples in your situation still have a lot of options to have children.

It's happening!\" only to see her cry when the test comes out negative *again* and she gets her period, will you just let her suffer without knowing the truth? \n\nAre you going to pretend when you DO finally get tested that you didn't know this whole time? Because you could. You definitely could. \n\nBut doctors don't usually recommend being tested for infertility until a few years after trying. Are you able to do that? Lie to your wife for years?

HOWEVER, you have GOT to be upfront and honest with your fiance and let her make the choice for herself if she wants to stay with you or not.   While it might hurt in the short term to find out her dreams might not come to fruition, it will hurt significantly more if she sticks around and finds out that, not only have you been lying to her (a lie of omission is still a lie), that she's now in a position where she can't have biological kids with ANYONE (a woman's biological clock is always ticking).", "You need to tell her before you get married. Personally it wouldn\u2019t matter to me but it does seem that way to her. I don\u2019t know if maybe she\u2019d go with a sperm donor or like adoption with you if it is truly a dream for hers. But it\u2019s not fair to you or her to get into a marriage not knowing about this.", "YTA. This news should have been shared with her immediately upon receiving it. She's the person you plan on spending the rest of your life with, why would you hide this?\n\nTell her ASAP. If she loves you as much as you love her she will understand and the two of you can go from there.  I wish you both the best.", "YTA.\n\nBoth for delaying and for telling anyone else before her. She should have known well before your sister!", "Your definitely  the asshole right now. Your sparing your feelings and denying  your partners. \nShe has to decide for herself.

The longer you wait the more she will feel like this has been hidden from her and there may be more hurt. If you truly love her, put her before yourself and tell her. You fear she may leave you, but she may not. After you tell her she may need some space. If she decides to stay with you, then you can talk about the option of sperm donors. Whatever you decide for your future, be sure to go to counselling so you can both sort your feelings about this. At this point you need to tell her though. Tell her you needed time to process, but you can\u2019t go much longer without telling her or she may feel potentially betrayed.\n\nEdit: sentence structure", "I am sorry for your pain. You need to be honest with her. If she loves you she will be there for you and you can figure it out together. You can still have children and they will still be yours even if they are adopted. There are so many little boys and girls that need loving homes. You would be a family of the heart.\n\nHowever, if you keep putting it off and she finds out she will be hurt by your inability to be honest and trust her...especially when this affects her future as well as yours.", "YTA. Tell her.", "I don\u2019t know why everyone is taking things at face value here. This doesn\u2019t sound like a guy who has seen multiple fertility experts who have confirmed that he doesn\u2019t make any swimmers and there\u2019s no viable way to pursue methods like sperm retrieval etc. If you are truly infertile, you need to tell her. But many times a doctor says something off the cuff and it\u2019s misunderstood. The proper thing to do is to set up a visit with your reproductive specialist and her and talk about options or further work up that may be warranted. You owe her a clear picture of what having kids would involve with you", "YTA because you sound as if you will never feel ready to disclose the info to your gf.\n\nYou are focusing on how bad it\u2019ll be if she knows and maybe leaves you but nothing about her feelings", "YTA dude. \nTo not tell her is literally tricking her into a future that doesn't exist, and it will have an expiry date. What happens happens is a cool saying, but unrealistic in this scenario. If you carry on like this and she suggests getting checked, getting ivf, whats your play there? It don't work.\n\nTalk to her, always talk to her. You took longer than you should've to tell her, but thats fair(ish) considering the shock for you.

If I was in your fianc\u00e9s shoes I'd feel betrayed you didn't tell me when you found out. This is my interpretation of what you're saying.\n   I suggest telling her you needed time to process your complex emotions, then explain the emotions you are dealing with.

Best of luck", "Your body your choice.", "YWBTA if you don't tell her. I understand you need some time to process but it's a conversation you need to have. Also, did they tell you infertile or sterile? Because those are two different things! If you just have a low sperm count, that isn't necessarily a death knell for having bio kids. It might just mean more work. Ultimately OP, if she really sees this as a deal breaker, there's nothing you can do. Waiting any longer is betraying her trust, you need to come clean. But you might want to check in with a doctor to find out exactly what 'infertile' means in your context before proceeding just so you have that info ready.", "God OP I\u2019m so sorry. NAH - YET.

You need to be honest in relationships.", "YWBTA if you don't tell her as soon as possible. Any day, minute, second you keep this from her, you are adding a much bigger problem to your relationship that will not end well for you: she can never trust you again. I understand why you are hesitant to tell her, and that you are absolutely heartbroken, as I assume from your post that you also have a wish for (bio) children, that clearly now will never happen. You have to believe that your relationship is strong enough that you can grieve about this together and hopefully overcome it. This is something you HAVE to do together, even if it means that she might feel different than you.", "YTA, you\u2019re with someone you know wants kids. She has a right to know that it isn\u2019t going to happen. It very well may be the end of the relationship but it may not be. Sperm donors are always an option, and still allow her to carry a baby. If you hide this however, the relationship will be over.", "Yta. I\u2019m so sorry about your situation. It sucks. That being said, she deserves to know. You are putting her in a situation where she will never be able to have her own biological kids without using very expensive services that a lot of people can\u2019t afford. Let her make her decisions. Some people would be fine with that, but finding out that your partner conveniently left that out before marriage would be very hard to accept for almost all people.", "YTA You can always get married this can always be the grounds for divorce in the future better yet an anullment", "YTA. It's better to tell her now and explain that there are ways you two could still have kids, just...not ones that are related to you unless a sibling or cousin is willing to donate.", "YTA 100% you are totally lying to your fiance.  You may be able to get past this unfortunate news together but only if you're honest with her.", "YTA\n\nIf you can't be honest with her, then why are you marrying her?", "YTA. She deserves to know before you get married. It could be a deal breaker for her", "I think the real question is - do you *want* kids? Because you can still have them if you're infertile - adoption, etc. It sounds like you've taken this diagnosis as an excuse not to have them, rather than just being honest with her about not wanting them. \n\nIf you do want them, then I don't understand why you wouldn't be honest with her so you can explore other avenues, instead of tricking her into thinking everything is going to be as easy as 1,2,3 pregnant. What happens when she can't get pregnant and starts blaming herself? Will you feel more or less guilty then? Nothing could be as easy as telling her now, rather than waiting for her to go through hell only to find out you've been lying to her. Also, are you sure you're ready for marriage? Because the choice to lie about this makes you sound extremely immature and selfish. It might be a cliche but it's true when they say marriage is all about compromise. If you can't put your own feelings aside to spare her some future pain, then you don't what what it means to compromise.\n\nAlso yes you are 100% the asshole for not telling her. If you think she should love you enough to marry you either way, you're an idiot. She would love you just the same if you were honest, but now you're giving her a reason to hate you by not telling her at all. She will find out one day and discover you purposely lied to her.
