This situation would still be scary at hell and you would still not be the AH for screaming.

Again scary as hell, might not be able to run away if needed. Again not the AH for screaming. \n\nNow you are blind, you are not able to see what is going on. Honestly, screaming is quite an appropriate response to create awareness for others should you need help from others because this person grabbing you have bad intentions. \n\nI cannot emphasise enough how much NTA you are here.", "How exactly were you supposed to know his intentions since he didn't bother to speak to you like a fellow human?\n\nI would have a very similar reaction if someone I couldn't see just grabbed me.
