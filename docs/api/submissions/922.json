I don't blame you for reacting like that! And that is not how you teach a child how to help a blind person, or anyone with a disability for that matter. \n\nGood on the HT staff for being there for you. As for you \"making a scene\", no. You taught that guy a lesson not to just go up to someone and touch them without consent. I'm sure he got a lot of nasty looks from anyone who saw this.", "NTA\n\nWe don't put our hands on other people", "NTA.  That man was inappropriate and you called him out in public.  If this is how he teaches his son to be kind to people in public, he is putting his son on the wrong path.  Plus he called you a slur?  You are so completely NTA.", "NTA and WTF was that dude thinking.  \"Helping a cripple\"??? I would have yelled at him myself if I saw that behavior.  You never just grab people! What a......  short on critical thinking kind of person he is.\n\nI live in a state that you never know who's carrying, so grabbing someone could become hazardous to your health.", "NTA and hopefully you *did* get him in trouble and his children learn that their father is a complete AH.", "NTA. No one should put their hands on anybody unless consent is given. Plus his language towards you calling you a \"cripple\" makes him a huge AH and you smart for getting the hell away from them.", "NTA. People need to understand that unless someone asks for help or is in blatant danger you need to leave them alone.", "NTA... he taught his child what not to do", "NTA. You did exactly right. Even a sighted person would react as you did. What idiot just walks up and grabs someone? This fool had no business teaching anyone anything and to insult you too? I hope he did get in trouble. He assaulted you. No one has the right to touch you without your permission, ever.", "NTA. Basics of human interaction, \u2018no means no.\u2019 You we\u2019re polite when you really didn\u2019t need to be as they just touched you without warning or permission.

I hate when people feel the need to grab you cause that is what they want to do. I understand your dilemma. I walk with a cane so when out shopping l walk as far to the right as I can so people can walk past me, around me or whatever. I can't tell you how many people try going to the right me instead of the left of me or bump into me cause they thought I should move over for them. I will literally be walking next to a shelf in the store or the store front in the mall and some asshole thinks I should get further to the right.", "NTA.

You taught his kid a more important lesson. When you are threatened by a stranger make a scene and save yourself!", "Well, he taught his kids how NOT to assist the disabled, so that\u2019s something at least?  NTA and don\u2019t feel bad for an instant.", "NTA. As someone who is also blind and uses a white cane at times(I have a guide dog) I\u2019ve had this happen to me more than once. It\u2019s unnerving and at times quite frightening.", "Nta! If someone grabbed me like that in public I'd punch them. I would immediately assume I was being assaulted (ptsd) so no, you did not go too far.", "NTA fuck that guy and his grabby hands. If he doesn\u2019t want to hear cursing, he shouldn\u2019t go up and grab strangers. It would have been so easy for him to ask you if you want help.", "NTA - he had absolutely no right to touch you in the first instance and knowing you were blind , did he not for one second consider how scared that would make you ? If he used the \"cripple\" word, then he taught his kid nothing but how to be a major AH.", "NTA\n\nWhat does he think he\u2019s teaching his kid by calling you a \u2018cripple\u2019. Sounds like a horrific man and father.", "Oh my god. I am so sorry. NTA. That person is a piece of work and you weren\u2019t wrong in the slightest to feel panicked and shout. If anything, maybe it will help him think twice about being an absolute asshat next time.", "NTA. You were 100% in the right to advocate for yourself and when that AH was so rude and ableist to persist with his \u201chelp\u201d you had every right to yell as loudly as you wanted with whatever words made the point you were trying to get across to them. Frankly, they\u2019re lucky to have not been charged with assault.", "NTA. OMG. I am so sorry OP. What kind of rude ah does that? Never touch someone without asking and this guy grabbed you hard. I would have screamed too. Good on the mall workers for helping you. Angels in my book. You take care OP.", "NTA. No one should be touching anyone without consent. I thought we had that covered by now, but apparently not. Yelling at you and insulting you was just the icing on the cake.", "NTA, I am sorry this happened to you.  People need to show both respect and restraint.  If you feel someone needs help, ask them.  Next you never put your hands on any individual without consent.  That is considered assault.  I would also have been beyond angry at being labeled a \"cripple.\"", "NTA\n\nI can\u2019t imagine how alarming that would be! And then to try to spin it in a way that tries to make them out to be doing a good deed is just doubly insulting.", "NTA. And who the hell says  \"cripple\" in the year 2022? Was this guy cryogenically frozen in 1955 and just woken up?", "NTA at all! No one has the right to touch, much less grab, you! And he says he's trying to teach his kid something? He's a total jerk for what he did, what he said and how he responded to you. I probably would have decked him. I'm sorry for all the ignorant people you must have to contend with.", "NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA. \n\nThere is no reason ever for anyone to ever touch you unless you ask them to or, I guess you are walking straight into a freeway, that is somehow silent. \n\nDon't walk on freeways. \n\nNTA.", "Hopefully his kid understood the real lesson: don\u2019t assault a person with a disability. NTA.", "NTA.  You helped teach his kids how NOT to help someone.  This would have sent me over the edge.  He is lucky that you only yelled at him.", "NTA and also, he could very well have been attempting to rob you. His words may have been false and a way to try and hide his true intention.", "Nta don't touch people without permission", "NTA. \n\nYou don\u2019t touch people without consent. Also, if people need help trust that they will ask. Unless they are endangering themselves, for example by waking in front a moving car don\u2019t interfere if they don\u2019t ask you to. This is what kids should learn. \n\nI would also like to add that I cannot imagine anyone else in the mall considering you the be in the wrong. Let\u2019s ignore for a moment that you a blind and just consider a woman walking in the mall with headsets on. This situation would still be scary at hell and you would still not be the AH for screaming. Let\u2019s then for a moment pretend you had a different disability that the man could use as an excuse to grab you. Let\u2019s say a walking disability. Again scary as hell, might not be able to run away if needed. Again not the AH for screaming. \n\nNow you are blind, you are not able to see what is going on. Honestly, screaming is quite an appropriate response to create awareness for others should you need help from others because this person grabbing you have bad intentions. \n\nI cannot emphasise enough how much NTA you are here.", "How exactly were you supposed to know his intentions since he didn't bother to speak to you like a fellow human?\n\nI would have a very similar reaction if someone I couldn't see just grabbed me. It's totally a natural reaction to being grabbed. \n\nMajorly NTA", "NTA", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
