Again scary as hell, might not be able to run away if needed. Again not the AH for screaming. \n\nNow you are blind, you are not able to see what is going on. Honestly, screaming is quite an appropriate response to create awareness for others should you need help from others because this person grabbing you have bad intentions. \n\nI cannot emphasise enough how much NTA you are here.", "How exactly were you supposed to know his intentions since he didn't bother to speak to you like a fellow human?\n\nI would have a very similar reaction if someone I couldn't see just grabbed me.

You're more likely to accidently release it in your pocket or lose an eye than have it be practical as a weapon.", "Oh, those things that are going around online? They don\u2019t work AT ALL. They\u2019re probably about as sturdy as OP\u2019s cane.", "Which addresses 1 of 3 problems without doing anything for the other 2.", "You didn\u2019t go to far.  Fuck that guy.  It would never cross my mind that someone would lay there hands on a blind person without asking first as if they were helping. \n\nFuck that person.  NTA.  Don\u2019t dwell on this if you can help it.", "NTA no one has the right to touch someone else. Ever.\n\nYou could have him for assault and it would be justified.", "Fellow blind human here. God I'm sorry. My heart goes out to you. As someone who has a fair amount of bad experiences with men, and/or other people grabbing me, this is honestly kind of triggering, but no. No. NTA. \n\nI'm glad the staff were understanding. I'm glad you had somewhere to go. This is almost exclusively why I do not listen to music why I walk anymore. I read though. Not much of a difference. \n\nI hope you're okay.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\n\nHe wasn\u2019t offering to help. Offering implies asking. \n\nHe wasn\u2019t treating you as human, he was using you like a doll. \n\nAnd, you do not know that he even had a child or that was his motivation. \n\nYou taught his child more than he did. \nYou do not touch people without their consent", "Totally agree.\n\nSomewhere out there is a cyberpunk alien inventor (like Anthony Geary in the movie UHF), working on a cane that is weighted correctly for proper vibration and is also a stun gun. \n\nMaybe it even conceals a hat pin in the handle for when you need a little stabby-stab.", "NTA. A large number of my family are blind and if someone you can\u2019t see grabs you, you have absolutely no idea what\u2019s happening or their intentions towards you. Making a scene just in case is the only way to go. He wasn\u2019t teaching his kids what to do, he was showing his kids what not to do", "NTA. And you taught his son something important", "NTA holy fuck! You do not ever touch people without their consent. My fiance is legally blind as well, and he's stronger than he looks. If anyone did that to him they'd need an ambulance.", "Holy hell NTA. I have a dear friend who is completely blind. This man is an amazing athlete in cycling and shooting. He notices more things than me, and he would damn well cause a scene if anyone tried to grab him. Next time. Shout and stay there so you can make sure he\u2019s held to account (or don\u2019t! So you\u2019re safe!)", "Well, he was teaching his kid wrong, then, wasn't he?\n\nEven sighted people don't like being touched unexpectedly.  And that's with being able to immediately use the sense of sight to assess the situation.  Being touched unexpectedly when you are blind would be terrifying, I would think.", "Help a cripple??? I just cant right now. NTA. Thats all I can say. I am dumbstruck.   These posts really make me question my faith in society.", "Ehm\u2026 if you\u2019re blind how can you write this and read what everyone is writing ?", "NTA", "NTA i hope that man learned to keep his hands to his god damn self.", "Wtf did I just read?? Unless someone is in imminent danger, it\u2019s never ok to forcefully grab someone. That\u2019s called assault. You were being assaulted and acted appropriately. If he was really trying to help you, he would have asked you if you needed help. NTA.", "NTA-At all. I am disabled, and I am ok with someone getting the door for me, or offering to carry something a short way if I am really struggling, but otherwise....don't help, and definitely don't touch me.", "NTA NTA NTA\n\ni know this is late and you have hella people saying this already, but as a disabled person (though not blind) i really wish we'd all stick up for ourselves like this more.", "NTA. \n\nTHAT\u2019S MY PURSE\n\nI DON\u2019T KNOW YOU", "So, so NTA. I am sorry this kind of thing happens to you. The person was ignorant and probably embarrassed that you called him on the unwelcomeness of his behaviour. Swearing at him was perfectly justified in the circumstances. \n\nI'm sorry for his kid, because sounds like that kid is going to have to unlearn a fair bit of what his father teaches him.", "NTA. I screamed at a homeless man that was drinking beer in the McDonald\u2019s parking lot at noon to \u201cgo away\u201d (it was said in French though and translates more to \u201cget the f*** out of here\u201d). I\u2019m 30 weeks pregnant, I was trying to put my very unhappy toddler in his car seat, and I am deaf. I don\u2019t appreciate strange men coming up behind me at anytime but I certainly didn\u2019t appreciate one I noticed day drinking coming up to me at a time where I certainly felt vulnerable.", "No way. What that guy did to you crossed multiple boundaries. You did what you needed to do to protect yourself. You don't know what crazy person, like this guy, is walking up to you.", "I feel this could have been a good teaching moment \nTell the person it is NEVER ok to grab someone", "hard NTA, Just because your visibly disabled doesn't mean you don't have a right to your own personal space. and anyone that judges differently can take a hike.", "Good for you. Someone suddenly grabs you, what are you supposed to do? Wait until they actually mug you?", "NTA the stupidity of people still finds ways to surprise. The man is a huge AH and deserved to be publicly told off.", "NTA. You don't just grab another person, regardless of whether they are blind or not. I'm really sorry that people think your cane gives them permission to violate your personal space", "obvious NTA but I wanted to say I'm sorry this happened to you.  \nWe're so easily manipulated into thinking we're the A-hole in a situation, when some jerk chooses to get disproportionately angry at a completely natural reaction we have.  \nOF COURSE you screamed. You can't see. He grabs you out of nowhere. Anyone would have a panic attack.  \nDon't blame yourself for this. Godspeed with all those other assholes out there...", "\"a cripple\"? Oh no...\n\nDefinitely NTA", "Well, he did end up teaching his kid the right lesson - don't go around grabbing people. NTA", "Nta", "And he didn't care about actually helping, he wanted to look like a good Samaritan whether op needed help or not", "NTA", "who tf DMd you saying you were horrible to cause a scene? those ppl must also think its ok to grab strangers without consent. id love to see how thet react irl if someone touches them without consent. some ppl on the internet need help", "Curious, as a blind person how do you do reddit? I assume someone helps you but maybe there's some cool tech I don't know about.", "To me it seems so obvious and intuitive that you don't touch a stranger without their permission, than it blows my mind that so many assholes do it to blind people.", "Next time scream \"stop grabbing my ass you pervert\"! I am sorry this happened to you.", "That's exactly what I was thinking. The kid learned a lesson, alright. Not the lesson the dad had in mind, but a lesson nonetheless.", "There is technology for that, plenty of blind people are able to use the internet. Also not every legally blind person has literal zero percent vision, some have enough to see a screen even just partially!", "Sorry, friend, this happens more than you would expect. Usually, it\u2019s people trying to help us board or find a seat on a bus or train, sometimes trying to help us cross the road. I guarantee, every blind person has someone-grabbed-me stories.", ">People who want to help others don\u2019t grab forcefully. \n\nUnfortunately, that is not true. Every single person I know who has a visible disability and uses some sort of device, be it a cane or a wheelchair, can tell numerous stories of people grabbing (sometimes quite forcefully) without asking and not stopping when told not to. For some people a disabled person is fair game when it comes to \"helping\" as they see fit, usually because they are ableist AHs but believe themselves to be \"doing good\". They don't understand that they are at best plain rude and at worst a danger to the disabled person. That is not to say that the guy in OP's story wasn't up to something bad. And OP had every right to be as loud and forceful as necessary.", "I just do not understand why you would ever grab someone. Like no one likes being grabbed?", "There's tech! Like stuff that reads out the text. Also OP hasn't specified but blind doesn't necessarily mean like zero percent vision always. Many legally blind people have very partial vision that may be enough to see a screen!", "And the guy wasn\u2019t even claiming to be trying to help OP; he was trying to forcibly use her as a prop for his demonstration.", "He should  have asked before  touching you if you were ok with it . No one have the right  to touch  you without  consent  and double  down  when you are clearly  distressed.  Nta at all", "You're telling me you both have the ability to fight with swords and you have the legal right to carry one around without anyone asking questions (shut up, I know it's a cane, but in my mind there a sword hidden in it).\n\nI'm just going to ask - are you Matt Murdock? (Shut up, there can be a female Daredevil)."]}
