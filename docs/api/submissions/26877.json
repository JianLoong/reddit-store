No muss, no fuss - just getting on with enjoying life.\n\nTell the people who say you abandoned your bf that he didn't include you, so how can you abandon him?", "\u201cAbandoning\u201d him? Kind of hard to do that when you weren\u2019t able to go with him in the first place because HE didn\u2019t get YOU a ticket \u2026 \nNTA - I hope you have the best time with your friend!!", "NTA.  Your boyfriend wasn\u2019t planning to go to the event with you when he bought his solo ticket; why should you have to go with him now?  If it was fine for him to go alone before, it\u2019s fine for him to go alone now.", "NTA. \n\nWhat a lame excuse. Even if he did misread it, what kind of idiot, who is in a relationship, would buy ONE ticket for himself and not think to get one for their partner who also likes the same artist? That is so weird to me.", "how can you abandon your bf when he didn\u2019t even include you in the first place lol - nta", "https://youtu.be/Tyht51XDvbQ?si=idKVlmsl4Vsh89xo\n\nThis meme sums up what is happening. \n\nAlso not the asshole. You have receipts of him agreeing, if he thought it was weird, wouldn't he have reread it to make sure he read it correctly? The \"misread\" boat doesn't float.", "NTA. At worst, all you did was not communicate you'd go with your friend after he didn't buy tickets for you two. It's reasonable to go on your own or with friends. It's fair that he preferred to go with you. However, they're assholes for calling u an asshole", "What I'm confused about is where even is the issue from his side? Like he fucked up and you have a right to be mad at him. Instead you rolled with it and made plans to go on your own. How are you being mean? By being independent? Is this other friend your ex or something?", "Someplace in Mexico? Pull the other one, dude.", "Your bf didn't care that you weren't going with him. If he were then he would have bought you a ticket.\n\nYou're NTA and it isn't your job to ensure that your bf correctly reads the texts you send him. If he knows that he has trouble comprehending texts then he needs to read them several times in order to ensure he understands.", "NTA. He knew she liked it, she asked him to get her a ticket. He didn\u2019t. He has zero credibility here and no reason to be upset", "\"my bf offered to let me to sell his ticket and then we could buy two tickets together\"\n\nYour BF could have sold his own dang ticket for his own dang mistake and then you could've bought two tickets together.  Interesting that he screwed up and wanted *you* to do the legwork to fix it.\n\nNTA for going with a friend instead of accepting that invite to messytown.", "NTA and his reasonings are BS. I\u2019m kinda surprised he didn\u2019t bring up going together in first place if he was the one who brought up the event.  \n  \n*Regardless* if his actions were on purpose to leave you out or not, he sounds like an inconsiderate self-centered ass. Miku would be disappointed too.", "Even if his reading comprehension is bad why wouldn\u2019t he assume you\u2019d wanna go if ur also a miku fan", "NTA. That's the dumbest excuse I've ever heard. He's either too embarrassed to admit he forgot or he's going with someone else and doesn't want you to know... But probably the former.\n\nI understand how big of a deal it is since I'm a Miku fan too (lol) and why he's upset that you won't go with him, but you already told your friend you'd go with them, he can't just ask you to ditch them at this point...", "Shit, my bf would have initially asked me to go with him and bought both tickets anyways so we can go do things together. Even if I didn\u2019t like it, I\u2019d still put up with it for him and when he doesn\u2019t like someone I really want to go see he does it for me as well. You\u2019re NTA but your bf is, he clearly knew you liked it too he should have bought the ticket for you before even asking.", "how are your bf and his friend claiming that you going with a friend is \"abandoning\" your boyfriend.. when he planned to go alone the whole time?", "Nta he should\u2019ve just bought a ticket for you or asked twice if he doesn\u2019t read that well? You really wanted to go and if he paid a little bit more attention to you her know you where a fan", "NTA. This feels very much like he forgot about your request (or didn't have the money) and then tried to cover it up with the weakest possible excuse. Go with your pal, you are not \"abandoning\" a grown man who couldn't remember to buy two tickets lol.", "I\u2019m going to have to agree with everyone else and say NTA here. To me it sounds like he got caught in his lie trying to go without you and offered to have you sell the tickets to make his lie more convincing and not make things worse between you guys. I\u2019ve never been in this situation before, but I have invited people along to do things with my friends and I when I didn\u2019t want them to go because I didn\u2019t wanna look like a bad person. I think he\u2019s just trying to look good by telling you to sell the tickets knowing you wouldn\u2019t want to do that, so you\u2019d say no and then he\u2019d be able to whine and beg for you to go with him when he didn\u2019t want you to go in the first place. Again, to not look like the bad guy. Then again, idk him so maybe I\u2019m wrong. I stick by my opinion on NTA though. Have fun with your friends, you don\u2019t need him to enjoy that concert.", ">abandoning my boyfriend.\n\nYou're not abandoning him since he was planning in going by himself anyway. NTA.", "NTA. Just go and ignore him like seriously. He did it on purpose, think he probably want to control you and now he\u2019s gaslighting you. Make sure you keep those tickets safe or hand it over to your friend who you are going for safe keeping. I don\u2019t trust your bf not to sabotage your plans.", "NTA\n\nYou were never abandoning him. He didn't even think about including you or asking you if you wanted to go. He had zero expectation of you going with him, zero thought that it would be nice for the two of you to go together. So how, the heck, are you abandoning him?\n\nHe misread your text (it didn't even prompt him to think) and never considered you going with him at all. He was 100% planning to go to this without you. So why should he be upset if you decided to make plans to go there without him?", "NTA- \nLol, \"Sorry, I can't read\" is the epitome of gaslighting.", "NTA. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. \nSo he let me just put this into pinpoints:\n\n- he \"misreads\" your text in the most \"how don't you follow that up with some questions if you have even just an ounce of interest in your partner\" way. Or does actually reread it because it seemed out of context to him which he admitted, \n- does not even think of asking you if you want to come before buying the tickets when you clearly are a fan\n- \"graciously\" offers you to correct the mistake he did (selling his ticket and getting new ones for you both)\n- is mad when you don't do that and go with a friend\n\nAm I missing anything? This screeches intentional to me. Even if you Interpret his actions in the most positive way he is ignorant towards you and does not own up to his mistakes. Even if it was a honest mistake it was his and it's up to him to fix that. Not you or anybody else.\nIs he always that oblivious to your interests and wants? And puts his mistakes on you? If this wasn't a one time off I would think really hard if he is really a partner or just some additional work and headache.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"jump straight to making plans with someone else and abandoning my boyfriend.\" .. HE abandoned you, not the other way around.", "abandoning your bf??? fjkdfdkjs are they serious?   \n\n\nNTA have fun with your friend.", "NTA\n\nHe sounds a bit selfish. If he wanted to go to a concert, the natural thing to do would be to ask his girlfriend if she wanted to go too, regardless of whether or not she is a fan. All this rigmarole of 'I thought you said Mexico,' is just bluster. \n\nIf he tells you he has planned a trip to Mexico, be prepared to hitchhike.", "NTA it's not your fault your boyfriend checked out mid text conversation. Sounds like he didn't want you to go and also didn't want you to go with someone else. Either way sketchy.", "Figure out what his seat number is and check out who he\u2019s sitting next to at this thing. That person is why you weren\u2019t invited.", "NTA. If he knows his reading skills are bad then he should be paying extra attention while reading your messages. He is just lying about misreading it and is making up lame excuses. You did the right thing OP", "NTA, he fully prepared to go without you, so what\u2019s he so upset about? His plans haven\u2019t changed at all. I find it more troubling that you guys have left the country together, yet he still doesn\u2019t know what your interests are.", "NTA, but even if you give him the benefit of the doubt on the reading aspect. He knows she likes this stuff and didn't even bother to buy her a ticket or think 'hey maybe my gf who likes this too would want to come'. Why wouldn't you want to do something both you and your gf enjoy together? He's TA for gaslighting you about going with someone else when he didn't even think of going with you in the first place.", "Hard to see how OP is an AH for making plans with someone else when her bf clearly wasn't planning to do anything with her at that time.\n\nNTA", "BF might actually just be dumb. If he really didn't want her to go for some reason, he wouldn't have brought it up to begin with and wouldn't show her the ticket.  He would simply go. Or tell her about the event only after buying his ticket. \n\nEven if one is to assume malice, this would be the dumbest way to go about it. Unless of course he has a past history of trying to hurt/one up OP on purpose.\n\nOP is still NTA, and BF looks bad not matter what, but I honestly don't see how this could've been some premeditated ploy.\n\nEdit: typo", "Holy crap, calm down. There's absolutely NO WAY you can determine this from a one sided, extremely short explanation of an incident. And this isn't what OP asked for.", "Stan culture is the worst", "I wouldn\u2019t call anyone an ass for misreading (if that was what really happened). I\u2019ll admit reading mikuexpo had me thinking it was an entirely different word until I stared at it (betting the bf didn\u2019t stare at it) and remembered the blue haired anime singer. \n\nAny way I was gonna go NTA until I read where he put a suggestion on the table but OP thought it was too much hassle. Had me thinking he was probably genuinely confused but with all these comments getting into their feeling, if she had listened to even one they probably broke up by now.", "I like the part part in when saying it was a mistake he said that she can sell his ticket and get 2. Basically making her do all the work for his \"mistake\"", "This one is, yeah. \ud83d\udc80", "Hell yeah!", "How are you so twisted up about OPs bf being called a liar? That's like, the most vanilla name to call someone. Are you the bf? Lol", "Based on the edit, that's what the bf offered to do and op said no", "I'm not upset about him being called a liar, I'm concerned about all the extra drama added \n\n-Calling him a victim blamer \n\n-Saying he does not care \n\n-Saying he's blaming OP for him being a liar \n\n-Saying this is the best he'll ever be (this is the biggest one for me, like how can any of us POSSIBLY know that?) \n\nI just find it extremely unhelpful to OP to put these thoughts in their head, when it might not be accurate at all. Better to just answer the question that was asked.", "LOL \ud83d\ude02", "Nah, the boyfriend offered to let her sell the ticket and then buy two new ones. A very different thing.", "How is her having to sell and Rebuy the tickets a real solution? It was his mistake to begin with, why should she have to put in the time and effort to correct this mistake? Even if it was an honest mistake and he was just inconsiderate af it's on him to show her that it was a mistake by owning up to it and putting in the effort to go with her. \n\nInstead he just dumps the additional workload on her. She should go above and beyond so she can go with him when he didn't care enough to even ask. What a Chad.", "Good point. All this is bit confusing yet people are getting into feelings. On one side the bf messed up on something so straightforward but at the end offered a way for them to still go together but the gf refused. If he really didn\u2019t care he wouldn\u2019t put that on the table? Something here sounds inconsistent. This is one scenario I rather leave alone tbh."]}
