YTA. You are adults now, maybe you can talk it out or at least find a way to handle each other", "YTA.    \nYour son won\u2019t have a happy birthday if one of his good friends is excluded for reasons beyond his understanding.

You guys don\u2019t have to be friends, but you can hopefully get to a point of respectful acquaintances.", "YWBTA - you'd be punishing two innocent boys for something that has nothing to do with them.  Perhaps you and his mom should meet for coffee and clear the air.", "Invite them. When they arrive tell her you are still pissed about the high school bs. She may apologize.

I can't just throw away the lingering effects of being bullied, or the anxiety that comes with having to face that person again.\n\nI think it's a good moment to accept those feelings but put them in their proper perspective and move on.\n\nInvite the kid.

I would never let my kid be friends with somebody whose mom was a jerk to me.", "I agree that OP will have to let it go at some time, and for her, I hope there's other kids her son becomes better friends with, so she'll have to deal with this mom as little as possible in the future. \n\nYou sound really condescending though. Your comment is only missing the \ud83d\udc4f, instead of the periods. \n\nHigh school bullying is something that stays with you. OP is not going to like inviting her, and it's a stretch to be all cheery and welcoming to her high school bully, which is understandable.  If you do not understand,  I take it you've never been on the receiving end of bullying.  \n\nOP, you can't not invite this kid. Your kid isn't going to understand, and explaining it will cause a shitstorm, so suck it up.

There's a lot of kids to play with at that age an is the parent who need to decide who is trustworthy or don't.

I teach at the school I attended and am amazed how many people will hold on to this high school bullshit. I got bullied pretty bad my Freshman year but I wouldn't hold that against an innocent kid just because their parent was a bully as a teen. Who knows, you may get along great with the mom now that you're both adults since none of us are the sane people we were in high school. I know I've become friends as adults with people I hated in high school because most people change as they grow up (though it doesn't sound like OP has).\n\nAlso, this party is for your son's birthday, not for you. So yes, YWBTA to not invite the friend he wants to invite. Why are you trying to dictate who your 5-year-old is friends with? Would you want him excluded from a friend's party because the friend's mom didn't like you? Grow the fuck up OP and put your kid first or you're a massively shitty parent whose son will probably be friendless because the other parents won't want to deal with his childish, selfish, and judgemental mother.", "I will never not be stunned at the amount of parents who don\u2019t realize setting your bullshit and feelings aside for your child **is part of being a parent**.", "Not to mention how this other little boy is going to feel when his friend doesn't invite him to the birthday party.\n\nOP wants to punish two small children for an offense neither of them committed to avoid an uncomfortable situation. \n\nAsk someone to help run interference, just accept it's going to be awkward, or heck, if you can, maybe talk to this other mom and clear the air.", "I say don't punish the kids friend either, he did nothing and probably wants to go to ops kids birthday party", "Some people can.  The 'bully' probably has grown up and changed her ways and is a great mom.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe OP, sadly, is emotionally still in high school and hasn't grown up.

But my dad did not get along well with the aunt, so every time we wanted to do something with them it was a big hassle. And I remember just feeling so resentful, and I was only 10 years old! I just wanted to hang out with my fun cousins that I liked spending time with. \n\nI can\u2019t say that OP is wrong because I don\u2019t know them or the bully, but I will say that if you try to keep the kids apart they\u2019ll pick up on it.

What happens if the kids are besties? How long can this really be avoided?", "Terrible advice, kids remember things from when they were 5.  Like how their mother didn\u2019t let them invite a close friend because she was petty.

It is a very simple no he can't come over that day can you pick someone else?    \n\nHope he has a great birthday and you enjoy it too.  You'll have enough stress without your ex bully in your home.

She should rise above and carry on.\n\nWe cannot live in the past and her being icy is just staying in the past and keeping trauma alive.", "Perfect response! Also, for the sake of your son, be the bigger person. I\u2019ve seen other people saying to just mingle more with the other parents. That\u2019s solid advice as well. While I completely understand not wanting to be around someone who treated you like that in the past, it\u2019s about your son now and YWBTA for not inviting his friend.", "Ooh I like your advice the most, it's petty but in an adult way", "Worked for Romeo and Juliet.\n\nOh wait.", "What if not? They want to play now.\n\nAnd it\u2019s hard to be an AH when you are 5.\n\nAnd their allegiances will change like 200 times before they settle in their ways.", "You know a great way to make sure a kid ends up like their parents?\n\nNot being a positive influence and isolating them to only being around the parent.", "If the kid bully he should be avoided, but you can't just assume that.", "I was bullied for four fucking years through high school and not just with words sometimes physically. I\u2019m in my 50s and I still haven\u2019t gotten over it and still wouldn\u2019t talk to my bullies to today. And I would want absolutely nothing to do with them at all. They made my life a living hell for four years and nobody did a damn thing about it and told me oh you just have to deal with it it\u2019s part of grown up and that is the biggest bullshit line and it\u2019s still being used today. I don\u2019t blame this person one bit for not wanting that woman in her house.", "Why should she? Turning someone\u2019s friends against them has to include a situation that made that possible.

At least normal in my personal and familial experience.", "Exactly.   They are both 5.  Being left out of a party will barely register with either of them.  Why should mom be stressed on her son's birthday?  Why should she be in contact with bully over a child's birthday?  Also, apple usually doesn't fall far from tree.  I could see if the child was 8 but how much do you remember of your 5 year birthday party?  There is no guarantee the bully mother will behave.   She disliked OP enough to deliberately hurt her once.", "I don't think it's civil to be icy. I think they are opposites. To be civil, you are polite which includes being gracious and warm. It doesn't mean you have to fawn over her and try to be her friend - it means you make polite small talk, you thank her for coming and for the gift, and you move on. People can tell when you're being cold on purpose. It's not a good look and makes it seem like you are bitter and holding on to a grudge from high school...adults have to rise above that even when it's hard.", "Be icy because some people deserve it lmao \n\nYou can be both in the present, and cold diplomatic", "That sounds like such a boomer comment. \n\nBeing icy isn\u2019t being rude it\u2019s just not opening the door for the other woman to think they are friends and can form a relationship.", "It\u2019s not living in the past, it\u2019s just\u2026 not forgiving assholes who didn\u2019t even ask for forgiveness?

Some kids are bad influence, you can teach him why not all oeople is good and can interact with them, becauseb the gossiping is less notorious than the violence and verbal abuse.", "IT'S NOT ABOUT HER! This is about 2 innocent kids who want to hang out.", "Then you need therapy. As someone who was also bullied verbally, mentally and physically\u2026 I know those people aren\u2019t the same person they were as kids, as they are now. You would really benefit from getting help. \n\nHolding so much anger towards children, because that\u2019s what they were, is not healthy. \n\nAlso, your situation is VASTLY different to OPs.

Being excluded when all the other kids will be talking about it before and after. \nAnd my 17yo just a few weeks ago reminded me of a party she was not invited to when she was 6 (she met again with the girl recently and they reminisced the good old days). \n\nExcluding the kid is tough on OP\u2019s son and the other kid. Punishing a kid for his parent\u2019s error/misdeed is just petty revenge. Not the kind of role model you want to be for a kid.", "If it was about OP alone, sure. But it\u2019s about her child. And, once again:\n- it\u2019s hard to be a gossip when the kid is 5yo, they don\u2019t have the brain development for that;\n- their friendships will change a million times.

So some of them do not change I had one bully for middle school that did change that did apologize to me, but then didn\u2019t understand how come I didn\u2019t wanna be buddy buddy with him as friends as adults. Thanks for the apology still doesn\u2019t get me over what you did to me. And I have had therapy I don\u2019t put up with bullshit from anybody anymore and it\u2019s made me a stronger person.

All that needs to be said is  \"Sorry Sweety,  So and so won't be able to come that day, who else would you like to invite\". \n\nOP should never have to endure her bully in her home.   Bullies don't change.", "Well I am not either but I did have friends who were bullied and I myself helped to bully a girl in high school to exclude her from our clique in high school.   It didn't work because the other cliques were meaner or undesirable to be in.  We teased her pretty hard but we never flat out told her to get out so she always ate lunch with us.  I would never expect this girl to invite me or my child anywhere.   Sins of the mother pas to the child.", "I was not asking to be judged but ok.

Being excluded at 5 for one party that the whole class is not invited to is not life altering.  Why should mom be uncomfortable during a party at her house?", "You know the mother can interfere with the kid, trying to get information or telling him lies, at 5 also can tell what they see or hear", "I always thought better safe than sorry", "Exactly this. No detailed explanation needed.", "Have you met a 5 year old who isn\u2019t going to respond with \u201cwhy\u201d?

Inquisitive children will ask, and if they are a group who play regularly together, the one excluded will feel it (so yeah, it\u2019s a bit like OP would get \u2018revenge\u2019 from their bully by bullying a 5yo).\nAnd the chances are the kid already told his friends they would be invited, and the kids told their parents. I always knew about upcoming birthday parties weeks before getting the invitation.\n\nI don\u2019t understand that someone could stay stuck in high school so much that they cannot even act like an adult (and ready OP, it didn\u2019t really look like bullying, more teenager drama). \nAnd lying to children\u2026 great parenting advice!", "Kid\u2019s 5, they\u2019ve learned that sometimes mom says no just because. \ud83d\ude0f \n\nIt\u2019s not going to scar them for life. \ud83d\ude02", "Also now it is likely the same thing is going to happen to him when the bully's kid has a party.

They do not deserve this.", "Exactly, your effectively continuing a cycle of bullying and you\u2019re disappointing your child because you\u2019re too petty? Grow up and set a good example for your kid and show you\u2019re the bigger person.  A parent should put their child first before any kind of highschool beef lol", "You do you. Just don\u2019t ask later why your kids question your behavior.\n\nJust think an adult should act like one for the sake of their child but for some people that\u2019s not the priority."]}
