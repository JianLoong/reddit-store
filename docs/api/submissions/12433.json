She is a junior in college and I have been out of college for a year.  This is my first relationship, but she had been in a 2-year abusive relationship that left her feeling very insecure about relationships in general.  I have been close to my family (both immediate and extended) throughout my life, and I now live about 6 hours from them as this is where I found a job.  I still enjoy seeing them, so I try to make it down for a long weekend when there is a holiday or I haven\u2019t seen them in a while. In total, I am either visiting them or they are visiting me every 2-3 months, so maybe 5 times throughout the year. \n\nShe has always had a problem with this because she says it feels like I am not prioritizing her and now that I am an adult, I shouldn\u2019t be seeing my family as often. I told her I am not trying to not prioritize her, but it\u2019s important that I see my family.  She says that she is my family now and she needs to come first, especially with her last she feels like she needs that extra support.  So this has caused several fights when I\u2019ve went home for holidays, and the problem isn\u2019t always that I\u2019ve left, sometimes it is that I don\u2019t call or text enough when I\u2019m gone.\n\nFast forward to this trip. I have had this family trip planned for 6 months, and the trip is 4 days total.  The last time I saw my family was Christmas.  There was no indication that there would be a problem until last week when she said it was really bad timing because she had a lot of schoolwork and needed my moral support.  She has two tests this week and project, and she says she can\u2019t do well on them without me there.  She asked if I would stay home from the trip if she really missed me, and got mad when I didn\u2019t immediately say yes. We kind of went back and forth on whether it was okay for me to go for the past week.\n\nThen the night before my trip, she is crying and asking me not to go, and the morning of the trip she says she really needs me to stay back or she won\u2019t be okay. At that point it seemed too late to me, so I still left. I feel terrible because she is saying I betrayed her while she is going through depression and that I don\u2019t prioritize her like she needs, and that I should have stayed home from the trip.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678975871, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11sv9tl/aita_for_going_on_a_family_vacation_while_my/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The isolation (\u201cI\u2019m your family now\u201d). None of this is ok.", "Yup. Though this feels like maybe it's not co-dependency, but emotional blackmail.", "\"She says she is my family now...\"\n\nOh hell, no... that's a line from a horror movie!", "Abusers will often play victim to people who don\u2019t know the situation too. Not saying she was the abuser and not the abused, but it\u2019s definitely a thing.", "This is really concerning. It would be MAYBE different if OP would leave her to see his family every week or so, but only every 3 months? In regard of them not even dating for a full year, that means he left her like 3 to 4 times?  \nHer reaction to this is not healthy!", "This is exactly what I thought! OP you\u2019ve described a lot of red flags with this relationship. It\u2019s not healthy and you should break it off ASAP.", "It reminded of the movie Fatal Attraction. Oooofff, no thank you."]}
