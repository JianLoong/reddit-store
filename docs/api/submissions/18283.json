I have extremely high postpartum anxiety so much so that I\u2019ve resulted to having nightmares about my baby being hurt.\n\nDue to unfortunate circumstances my parents, myself and my baby, and my sister (F32), BIL (M32), and their 3 kids F8, M5, F2) have all come to live under one roof. I haven\u2019t told anyone out loud about my boundaries (except my mom) but I make sure that if any of the kids want to hold him it has to be at home, on the couch, with a responsible adult. This is known by all the adults because they have all been participants in this. \n\nMy sister and BIL have not been very good parents. I won\u2019t go into specifics but it\u2019s a nightmare and I just want to keep me and my baby out of it as much as possible. Yet my sister and BIL have made comments about me not letting their kids hold my baby all the time. There is also the way the kids act with him. I don\u2019t appreciate that the oldest niece and my nephew won\u2019t listen to me when I tell them how to behave with him. \n\nWith all that being said today my parents (both 62) and I took my grandmother to visit my grandfather\u2019s grave for Memorial Day. He was an army vet and she misses him terribly so we make sure to take her as often as we can. My sister, BIL, and their kids met us at the grave site. \n\nWe had been there for a while and were planning on leaving soon. My sister wanted to take a picture of her kids by my grandfather\u2019s headstone and mom thought it would be a good idea to have all the grandkids take a picture with him. I took my baby over to the grave and sat down next to the headstone on the opposite side of my oldest niece with the two littles behind the headstone. \n\nI have never liked to be in family photos or really in photos ever even with friends. I\u2019m very reluctant and don\u2019t make a habit of i but I thought even if I don\u2019t show my face I would like to have a photo of me and my baby with my grandfather\u2019s headstone since he meant so much to me. My sister made a comment of this and someone made a comment about having my oldest niece hold my baby. When I said no my sister got defensive and asked \u201cwhy can\u2019t she hold him\u201d with a rude tone. It hurt my feelings knowing someone would so blatantly disregard my answer knowing the way I am at home. \n\nI immediately got up and walked over to my mom and was on the verge of tears. I gave her my baby and walked away saying I don\u2019t feel comfortable. I know babies are very sensitive to moods especially that of their mothers so I went on a short walk to fill my water bottle (I could still see them) to clear my head and calm my nerves. By the time I got back they had already taken photos and we\u2019re getting everyone ready to go. \n\nI may be TA by being too overprotective by not giving my niece the opportunity to hold him and ruined a photo of all the great grand babies and just making tensions worse overall.", "created_utc": 1685170749, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13t0ik4/aita_for_not_letting_my_niece_hold_my_baby/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
