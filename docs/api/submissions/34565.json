Pornography is intentionally and powerfully addictive (I studied it in psychology). Its completely reasonable to feel like you do, and might be worth asking hubby if he thinks he's addicted.

I'm exactly the same. Low self esteem is one thing but knowing your partner is looking at other women in a sexual light makes that self confidence drop even more. Thinking that they are getting turned on by looking at other women scantily clad is horrible but as far as porn goes we know it goes much beyond that. For me I just want my partner to be happy and fulfilled by me, knowing he needs to look at other women for that satisfaction tears me apart, and I can imagine it's the same for a lot of people. You should never feel like a bad person for having boundaries or wanting the person you hold dearest to you to only see you in such a vulnerable way, that's what's supposed to be special about a partner, and porn is taking that away from you.", "NTA, if it was me personally it wouldn't bother me.

He seemingly didn't consider intimacy with you an option, even though it was the perfect timing for it. His silence/refusal to talk about it is just more reason to be upset. Maybe he was tired and didn't feel like he could make you enjoy it. Maybe he wanted to get rid of a morning erection with minimal effort. But he couldn't say any of that, or communicate his feelings or intentions to you. \n\nAfter years of marriage, he should be able to do that. Maybe he's hoping the problem just goes away, but he clearly hurt your feelings and damaged your confidence.

There seems to be something that needs to be addressed between you two. If he doesn't come to you when he's feeling horny, instead watches porn, there is something wrong. You are not being silly or overreacting here. Have you ever turned him down?  Maybe he hasn't been completely honest with you about his feelings. Guys can watch porn and relieve themselves, instead of running the risk of rejection. I don't know if that is the case here, but his silence is weird.

Especially when it's a one off or a very occasional thing. If it became a regular occurrence and every time i tried to initiate sex she rebuffed me, then it would be a problem because it signals an actual issue within the relationship that something is wrong and we need to figure out what it is and how to fix it. But just one time? There's plenty of reasons she could have decided she didn't want to have sex that time, and that is perfectly ok. Like for example maybe she just didn't have the energy to go through the whole process of foreplay, the multiple position changes and then the eventual clean up. Or maybe she wanted to look at a visual stimulus that i don't have, or maybe she just wanted to quickly rub one out and take a nap. Who knows, the point is that it's not as big a deal as you're making it out to be if it's something that doesn't happen often, and if you're ok with the concept of them watching porn and mastubating to it then there's really no good reason to be upset with it happening just cause you're in the house.

No hate of course, but it\u2019s just that personally whenever I\u2019d masturbate, I would just picture hot scenarios of my man and get off to it wonderfully. I never saw a need for porn. This is why I don\u2019t understand why taken people will go on porn. Is picturing their partner not stimulating enough for them?", "boundaries are things you set for yourself, not things you make other people do or not do", "That\u2019s not what a double standard is.", "\u2620\ufe0f", "So men can't touch themselves but women can get massive dildos to fuck themselves with and that's just fine?\n\nPorn isn't an issue.

There's lots of ladies in relationships that still flick their bean to pornos", "thats a hell of a generalizatiob i dont lol", "Women watch porn too! Men watching porn is more socially acceptable for sure, but not something that is biologically intrinsic to men. The fact that it is more socially acceptable for men to watch porn probably means more men than women watch it, but I\u2019d argue the disparity isn\u2019t as large as we think. And the benefits men get from porn are the same for women :)\n\nI\u2019d say NAH. OP, It sounds like your husband isn\u2019t neglecting your sex life in favor of porn, and although this has made you feel insecure, I\u2019d bet it has nothing to do with you and he just wanted an orgasm without having to factor in your needs/worry about his performance?", "I agree that masturbation and sex are different but disagree with the whole \"men are wired differently\". Plenty of women think the same.\nI am a very typical woman. I watch porn. Like you said, it's just a visual aid, it's not a substitute for sex. Sex with a partner requires lots of work, and sometimes I just want to masturbate by myself. It doesn't mean I love my partner any less. It's like sometimes you want to order Domino's pizza instead of the fancy authentic Italian pizza, even though you know that Domino's is not going to be as good.", "Seek help.", "Can I ask why?", "Sounds like OP was willing/eager to have sex.\n\nInstead of their partner trying to initiate something - he chose porn.", "What the fuck", "Masturbation also isn't using sex workers to get off.

No man is every going to live up to the ridiculous fairy smut  I read, it\u2019s just fantasy", "[deleted]", "I 100% agree with this message. When I\u2019m tired especially, I just like some alone time with myself. Helps me sleep. Sex is energy and sometimes I don\u2019t have it.", "?\n\nI'd like to know why too", "They are porn sick and have no brain left. Yourbrainonporn is a great resource for studies on what porn does to the brain.", "Wanting to jack off to porn \u2260 wanting to have sex.

In 2 scenarios they're watching shows, but having sex, and masturbating with porn are not equivalent.", "\u2026. But it\u2019s not the same show. You\u2019re conflating masturbation with sex.", "That\u2019s not even close to the same thing lol, you\u2019re comparing apples to oranges with that question, for most people masterbating isn\u2019t interchangeable with sex, it is perfectly healthy to want to do it yourself.", "Fine, sometimes people need some alone time", "id be fine with it. theres many reasons why someone would rather watch the show alone, rather than with someone.", "If you\u2019re religious", "I think they should at least strive to be a fairy. \ud83d\ude0c", "Lol...

Porn users love to defend their weird stuff.", "I think they meant prostitution. They aren\u2019t using someone else just because it\u2019s a video. Or maybe not. I dunno.", "One could argue that they just feel like being on their own and watching their favorite TV show alone.\n\nBut OF COURSE the partner is going to be upset/confused if you just rejected the idea of watching the show together.\n\nIf buddy is exhausted or has no energy - then he can ask his wife to do all the work.

And if their issue is the ethics of the business of porn, which is a valid concern, I was simply pointing out that today, amateur content far outweighs studio productions.\n\n\nI heard someone say on a podcast that, if you're watching professionally shot studio porn today instead of real amateur stuff, you're an ape. Cracked me up, and I realised it's so true", "She didn\u2019t ask or offer though, so she wasn\u2019t turned down. It\u2019s not even about the aspect of porn, sometimes a person can want to masterbate and not want sex that is perfectly healthy and if you can understand there\u2019s no point in trying to make you understand.", "Imagine the sexes were reversed in this story, as has many stories been in the past. \n\nCommon trope in comments were [1] a woman doesn't owe a man sex in marriage, no justification needed [2] she has the bodily autonomy to enjoy self pleasure without entertaining him.\n\nBut now we have a degenerate man who owes sex to his wife because her needs matter more than what his mind and body wants, and he is ridiculous for choosing fast food over a gourmet meal.\n\nSometimes the mouth wants to taste fried chicken and fries, even though caviar is an option. Something quick an easy is less stressful to consume than something you're expected to savour because it's high value.\n\nLet's call spade a spade. This is about physical and mental control on the basis of sex.\n\nOP claims she has a healthy sex life. Her husband is taking care of her needs. Just not all the time. You wouldn't expect her to tend to his needs all the time either.", "But there is no way to find out if that was the case or if you're watching something that someone shared of another person without permission, or a forced video. There's never a way to know for sure. Not even on OF. Just like there's no sure way to know children aren't watching the vids bc they don't check IDs on dirty sites.
