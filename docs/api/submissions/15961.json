{"id": 15961, "submission_id": "132jjy0", "title": "AITA for refusing to let my friend crash at my place after she flaked on me?", "selftext": "I (28F) have been friends with \"Kat\" (30F) since college. We used to be very close, but our relationship has become more distant over the years as we pursued different paths. However, we still keep in touch and occasionally hang out.\n\nRecently, Kat asked me if she could crash at my place for a few days because she was in between apartments and needed a place to stay until her new lease started. I hesitated at first because I live in a small studio apartment and I value my privacy and personal space. However, I agreed to let her stay for two nights.\n\nUnfortunately, things did not go as planned. Kat arrived late and without warning, which meant that I had to delay my plans for the evening and wait for her to arrive. When she finally showed up, she seemed frazzled and distracted, and she barely acknowledged my attempts to make conversation. I assumed that she was just tired or stressed from her move, so I didn't press the issue.\n\nThe next morning, I woke up early to go to work, and I asked Kat to lock the door behind her when she left. When I returned home that evening, I noticed that some of my personal belongings had been moved around and that Kat had left a mess in the kitchen and bathroom. I felt annoyed and disrespected, but I didn't say anything because I didn't want to cause a scene.\n\nThe final straw came on the second night, when Kat invited over some of her friends without asking me first. I came home to find a group of strangers hanging out in my living room, drinking and laughing loudly. I felt uncomfortable and violated, and I asked Kat to ask her friends to leave. She did, but she seemed offended that I was being so uptight and inhospitable.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I couldn't take it anymore, and I asked Kat to leave the next morning. She protested and said that she had nowhere else to go, but I stood firm and told her that she had been disrespectful and inconsiderate of my boundaries. She left in a huff, and we haven't spoken since.\n\nNow, some of our mutual friends are calling me out for being a bad host and a bad friend. They say that Kat was in a tough spot and that I should have been more understanding and accommodating. They also accuse me of overreacting and blowing things out of proportion.\n\nI'm starting to second-guess myself and wonder if I was being too harsh on Kat.

She arrived late with no notice, left a mess, and invited guests into a home that isn't hers without asking. You had enough of it and asked her to leave. Idk how your friends think that makes you a bad person. Being in a \"tough spot\" is not an excuse to do the things she did.", "NTA, I am confused by your title because at no point did she flake on you, but if a guest invited people to my place without permission I would immediately kick them out. That is extremely rude.", "NTA, she totally abused your hospitality. The friends who judge you can take her in or shut up.", "Nta, \n\nSo good that your friends are volunteering their place for her to stay. Wait they aren\u2019t? \n\nI\u2019m guessing they only heard her side of the story, she violated a lot of rules.", "INFO: how exactly did she flake on you?", "NTA. You were able to accept messy and awkward conversations from a house guest (I wouldn\u2019t have been quiet on that personally). Friends don\u2019t seem to realize that they are still guests in someone\u2019s home. You were able to look past the awkwardness and inconvenience of it because she\u2019s your friend. You cared for her situation. \n\nUnfortunately that ends when your personal space is violated. I\u2019m so sorry she invited strangers into your home without permission. That\u2019s reason enough. She did this to herself. I\u2019m sure she never even thanked you either. Good on you OP. Not harsh in the slightest, you just got real with her. \n*edited for spelling and grammar", "NTA- How dare she have people in your home! You did the right thing.", "Absolutely NTA. Why didn't she stay with any the friends she invited over to your place without asking? She sounds toxic and if you don't talk to her ever again, it might be the best thing.", "NTA K either misconstrued what happened to your mutuals or you need an entirely new friend group.\n\nBy the by, you put commentors in a difficult place when you use the name you did for your friend. AITA basically has an automod on it that warns anyone who comments with that name for namecalling. I would edit with a different name. K, Kat, Katrina, etc.", "NTA\n\nYou said two nights. She stayed two nights and was rude and inconsiderate the whole time.", "NTA, let the friends host her.", "NTA- besides her not respectfully keeping ur home clean after you opened it up to her. She invited people over without your knowledge and consent.\n\nIf those friends are so upset, they should freely host her. Your home your rules.", "NTA she did not behave accordingly.", "NTA Kat owes you an apology for the way she acted. A good guest would have cleaned up after herself and left your belongings alone. A good guest would have asked you first before inviting her friends over. She got what she deserved. She obviously has other friends so it's not like she'll be sleeping on a park bench until she can get into her new place.", "NTA I never understand all these people who gang up on people for being 'bad hosts' without realising there is a social contract element to the guest/host relationship that assumes people will genuinely try to be good hosts and guests will genuinely try to be good guests. That means being respectful of the host's things, space, and routines; cleaning up after yourself; offering something like a bottle of wine, flowers or dinner to thank the host.  I assume your mutual friends took her in ;)", "NTA.  Kat took advantage of your hospitality.  Your friends are just as bad as she is.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nAlso, those friends heard one side of the story (probably a wild tale) and they can definitely host her. And while we only know one side, it's still your own home, not hers. \n\nAnd who the hell leaves a mess in someone else's home? Not cool. And then the impromptu party? Wtf? Are we 13yo and our parents are on an overnight trip?\n\nSounds like she never grew up and that's not your fault or responsibility to fix.", "NTA get new friends", "NTA. If Kat was in such a difficult situation she should have been far more grateful and respectful rather than leaving a mess everywhere and inviting people over without asking you. Your mutual friends can take her in if they feel that strongly. I wonder if she told them something completely different, I fail to see how they could think acting like that is reasonable when someone is doing you a favour.", "NTA. Kat clearly has no issues disrespecting another persons home. It was very rude of her to expect to do things how she wanted without asking you. You\u2019re not the AH OP.", "Is it not when her friend arrived late? So the original plan was flaked on, I\u2019m thinking.", "OP: Please please please explain this flaking", "Thanks. Edited.", "Please also explain why you said she could stay for two nights, but she ended up staying three, but you said you kicked her out on the second night?", "Thanks! :)", "Username checks out", "NTA she's a user. Let the mutials host her.", "i love how in all these stories of someone being a complete AH, there are always 'friends' who feel the need to criticize/shame the person who was screwed over in the first place.\n\nyou're NTA OP. and i hope you let all of those concerned parties that you'll rest easy knowing they must obviously be willing to host your ungrateful friend.", ">  Now, some of our mutual friends are calling me out for being a bad host and a bad friend.\n\nINFO is one of these mutual friends letting her crash for a while?  Or are they just people who are generous with YOUR resources?", "NTA I would have flipped shit for her having people in my home so I think you made the right call. She seems  obtuse of being a gracious guest whilst you\u2019re doing her a favor. No one else wanted to deal with her bs and hopefully she understands why now.", "NTA.  She abused your friendship", "NTA. she didn\u2019t flake, she didn\u2019t even try to be nice to you, she was self entitled and disrespectful of your space. under no circumstances do you have to put up with someone doing that.", "Kat belongs on r/choosingBeggars\n\nNTA. I\u2019d be pissed far quicker if someone pulled this shit in my home, much less in a limited space studio", "Arrives later than expected\n\nSeemed frazzled and distracted \n\nLeft your house a mess\n\nYou come home to her and her friends drinking \n\nDoes she really have a new place pending or does she have a drink or drug problem? I know this of course sounds totally far fetched but I wouldn\u2019t be that surprised if she\u2019s potentially spiralled into a bad place and can\u2019t pay rent anyway NTA", "NTA.\nShe was super disrespectful and left a mess after herself. And who invites people without asking the person that owns the place?\nDrop her as a friend.", "And let all the mutual friends who are criticising you can take her in for a bit - it\u2019s unlikely that they live somewhere smaller than a studio apartment\u2026", "Exactly"]}
