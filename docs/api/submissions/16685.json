Your SIL is trying to drive a wedge between your daughter and her stepsister, and you're playing into her game.  Treat the earned money as your stepdaughter's money, and if you don't like it, address it at the source (For example, require her (and your daughter) to get a real job, not work for her aunt.

The kid knows themselves that they are eating the cheap, less desirable food...this is wrong.\n\nIt's honestly wrong enough that as a parent I would want to find some way to either come up with the rest of the money or god forbid I would be very tempted to ask my sibling to either do this for both or stop entirely...and that's a bad situation...I don't want to punish one kid to uplift the other.\n\nHonestly, I think find a way to make the extra money to make up for this or the husband should either talk to his sister or his daughter about the concept of sharing is caring.\n\nI don't care if other people disagree with me...I am concerned about the feelings of exclusion that this will create for the other step child and the possible feelings of superiority this could create for the other child as well that can lead to a rift. The family has to find some way to move forward and mark things fairer for both kids and if I were the father if I couldn't provide it then I would be telling my sister No.\n\nI do have to say though I was also raised in a household where it was quite normal for my parents to turn down charity and they would encourage me to turn down charity and be generous to others.

Simple.", "That's up to hubby.", "Do you seriously trust the word of OP that the step-daughter has more money than both parents? I'm willing to bet that OP is heavily overexaggerating the amount of money the step-daughter actually receives, especially because she hasn't even said the amount. \n\nApparently, three of them are living in poverty and the stepdaughter is \"living a very comfortable life\" despite being a minor living under the same roof as the rest of the family. That claim alone leads me to think OP is full of shit", "I guess we both can't read so I'll say it again, not the SD's responsibility.\n\nCan she spend the money she has EARNED by doing chores for her aunt on OP's daughter, who is not working? Sure, she can do it out of the goodness of her heart but does she HAVE to? Nope.", "And jealous.   Jealous her STEP-daughter is getting money and her \u201creal\u201d daughter isn\u2019t.", "Even if it\u2019s thousands (which if it could support them all this be my guess) of dollars that is between the sil and neice.  It still be non of her business.", "If she wants to spend the money on her step sister, that's her choice. But we don't know the relationship she has with her step sister, so it's hard to call that one. What if the OPs daughter is entitled? What if their relationship is strained? I hate to make assumptions, but it's not far fetched to assume OPs child may have some entitlement issues because of how Mom is raising her.", "Do you consider your friends to be random people? How about spouses? They aren\u2019t family after all.", "Substantively there isn\u2019t. It is providing money for the sole benefit of only one member of a household. In fact, my best friend\u2019s daughter has been asked to ask me for money to cover stuff for her \u201cstepsiblings.\u201d", "Oh yeah that's true that didn't cross my mind!! But I suppose it'd be possible for some sort of affair... Even if they aren't related their shouldn't be such big of a gap in income equality. Obviously the step daughter shouldn't be punished but OP should be trying to find a solution to keep the girls on the same level", "I agree, but imo there has to be a solution because one kid having money to blow on whole restaurant meals while the other gets free lunch from school (which is terrible) isn't something that can go on long term. The daughter is gonna hate the step daughter and possibly her parents for not being able to have half decent food and the step daughter is gonna hate the daughter and the parents for being in a place where she's pressured into buying food for her sister. Something has to change. \n \n\nBoth are 14 but maybe the daughter can start thinking about getting a job and building a resume by volunteering. Perhaps OP can give a small allowance for volunteering/helping around the house. I don't think the step daughter should loose money but the kids do need to be equal", "Fair enough!\n\nMy point is that stepsister\u2019s meal is covered, it\u2019s just not up to her standards. And instead of encouraging her to work, or OP providing a better alternative, she\u2019s putting the onus on the step daughter to provide.", "I come from a blended family too, but the aunt has known for stepdaughter her whole life and OP\u2019s daughter only for much more recently. \u201cUnequal treatment\u201d doesn\u2019t really apply here.", "> The jobs either need to stop or both children need to be included in them.\n\nNo, they don't. She's not obligated to go out of her way to pay for her step niece. It's only a issue because she's rich.", "Exactly. My stepmom and her family treated me as if she gave birth to me. We didn't even use the word step. We were family. The aunt is driving a wedge using money because she doesn't like OP. The husband needs to step in and put a stop to it.", "We also don\u2019t really know if she\u2019s actually overpaying niece just that OP considers it, all in all I\u2019m really suspicious of OPs reliability when they say that they\u2019re leaving out a bunch of important details (the frequency, type and pay of the chores in question) as well as how many times step daughter is going out to a restaurant (if she\u2019s going once per week her \u201cpay\u201d might not be enough to bring daughter over)", "I choose my friends. My parents just don't bring in a person and tell me to treat them like a friend.", "That's assuming the aunt even knows OP's daughter at all.\n\nIf the aunt doesn't come over to their house and OP's daughter never goes over to theirs, the child could be a virtual stranger to her that she wouldn't even recognize in the street.", "Teenager."]}
