Your roommate is a total AH and deserved everything he got and is getting. He betrayed your trust and worse used his daughter to do that. Only reason you are slightly a AH is would have left her out of the scolding once heard her Dad was the instigator. It is hard for a child to say No to her dad. \nMaybe take her aside. Explain you can't handle anything hot and that you were angry because it was a nasty thing her father did. And sorry she got caught in the crossfire. \nIs her father a regular \"prankster\" and does he not usually not play them on you because your BF is there?", "The father and daughter are the ones calling it spicy. Do you have no reading comprehension? And it's an 11 y/o cooking, so obviously the child would put random spices in their food to experiment.

Think about it.... \n\nThe person who is the real issue here, isn't the 11yr old, it's her asshole of a father who just put her in a situation he KNEW you'd get upset over and at her over.\n\nApologise to the kid.

That makes no sense. Nowhere in the post does it even say what made the guacamole spicy - and that is key. What is really going on here is OP is a \u201csuper taster\u201d AND had a busted lip which made them extra sensitive to spice.
