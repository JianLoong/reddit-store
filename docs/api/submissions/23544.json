Your roommate was an AH for having his daughter push you to try something they knew was spicy and you wouldn't like. How else was that supposed to go? You are not the parent of the kid.

This whole thing was honestly not a big deal and is very small to argue or to stop talking to your roommate about. I think your overreacting a little bit and making it bigger than it is.

Your roommate is a total AH and deserved everything he got and is getting. He betrayed your trust and worse used his daughter to do that. Only reason you are slightly a AH is would have left her out of the scolding once heard her Dad was the instigator. It is hard for a child to say No to her dad. \nMaybe take her aside. Explain you can't handle anything hot and that you were angry because it was a nasty thing her father did. And sorry she got caught in the crossfire. \nIs her father a regular \"prankster\" and does he not usually not play them on you because your BF is there?", "The father and daughter are the ones calling it spicy. Do you have no reading comprehension? And it's an 11 y/o cooking, so obviously the child would put random spices in their food to experiment. At 10, I used to put spicy bacon bits in homemade mint choco ice cream (It was nasty btw)."]}
