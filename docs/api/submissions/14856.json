Your brother needs to tell the niece you\u2019re not feeling well and deal with it holy crap", "NTA. \n\nLet me understand this right\u2026 your brother and his ex do week-to-week, meaning that he gets a break from childcare duties every other week\u2026 yet he wants a break on the weekend of the week he has her, so palms her off on you? \n\nWhat\u2019s so important that he must do that he cannot go to the park with his daughter himself?? \n\nI get that it\u2019s a regular thing for you to spend time with her, and that\u2019s great.

Because it would **never** cross my mind to palm my kid off on someone who had just been hit by a car.

You are physically unwell at the moment. If you had a contagious illness, would he still want you to babysit? If you had plans with friends or ended up with a job, would he still insist? Do not let him steamroll you with this it won't ever end if you do. Also, this has been hard for me to teach myself, but \"NO\" IS A COMPLETE SENTENCE! You don't even have to give a reason if you don't want to. Consent isn't just for the bedroom or dating. This is all coming from a prior 17 year old who was basically forced into watching her nephews every weekend so her older sister and BIL could go party since they decided to have kids so young.", "NTA.

He's showing he doesn't care about you or the child, only the free babysitting. And he's using your niece to guilt trip you into doing it.

You are taking over parenting duties that your brother is unwilling/unable to do. If you are not getting paid for your time, you absolutely should be.", "NTA your brother is responsible for his own child (that he only has 50% of the time anyway).  He has no right to make demands on your time at any time, but especially not right now when you are injured, and recovering from a head injury.", "NTA. Your brother is very entitled and irresponsible.", "Recite? Recant is when you're like \"Oh no nevermind I was lying\"", "Yeah well, if that's your intention then it sounds like this weekend is good practice your brother needs to get himself (and niece) used to handling the weekend without you anyway. Like, otherwise what's he going to do when you're off to university in a year or two getting your teaching degree? Or working for paying clients?", "It sounds like your niece is an awesome little kid. Three sounds like the perfect age for her to learn that her wants need to take a back seat to other people's needs. Sometimes people get hurt and that means that their recovery needs to take precedent over going to the park. \n\nI feel like your niece will probably handle it like a champ. It's her dad I'm worried about :/", "Lol, I was going for recollect...thank you.", "NTA\n\nyour brother is wrong, and absolutely selfish. ignore him, and take care of yourself. your niece is fine, and will be happy to see you when you can actually take care of her.", "NTA, I watch my nephew on set days to help my sibling out. There have been days where I'm not doing so hot for mental or physical reasons. Each time they assure me it is okay and that my nephew isn't my responsibility and we will just hang out next time. Also with them being so young, you still have many years to spend with them. Get your rest and take care of yourself first!", "That's not hanging out, it's BABYSITTING, and you absolutely should not feel bad for not wanting to babysit after being hit by a freaking car!\nNTA, except possibly to yourself for letting your brother take advantage of you every weekend.", "NTA, but your brother sure is! Frankly, if it were my kid, I definitely wouldn't want someone with a concussion taking them to the park, regardless of whether or not they were a relative.", "Your brother is a major AH\n\nHe refuses to parent his own kids to the level where he gets a kid sister to do it for free? He literally wants someone with a concussion to be her mommy for him? Yuck yuck yuck\n\nNTA and don\u2019t let him guilt you, your brother decided to be a deadbeat- his kid should be looking forward to spending time with him, not you!", "Nta. But what is wrong with your brother?", "NTA. Your brother doesn\u2019t give a damn about you. He\u2019s a selfish dick. So sorry. Take the time you need to heal. Don\u2019t feel bad about not being able to do your usual with the baby. Tell her TT is hurt and it isn\u2019t safe for you to care for her right now. But when you\u2019re all better you all will go to the park. \n\nShe will be disappointed and upset but that\u2019s okay. She is allowed to have her feelings and work through them with hugs lol.", "Total NTA, you have concussion and you HAVE TO rest. Your brother is being an AH. It isn't even safe for you to take you niece to the park.", "Can you imagine trying to run after a 3 yo if she takes off with those muscle aches? \n\nMy last crash had my collar bone aching so bad I\u2019d pass out from it. NFW ~~ic puke~~ I could chase/carry a 3 yo if she took off or started throwing a tantrum!", "Does Op even get paid for her labor? :/", "It is also good practice to learn to set boundaries with the parents of your future students. You are not well, say no", "I doubt it.", "It doesn\u2019t even sound like it would be safe for you to be babysitting right now, for you or your niece. What happens if you get dizzy and pass out and you\u2019re alone with a three year old? Just tell him no.  He can parent his own child for the weekend, people do it all the time.", "NTA. People, it\u2019s not a crime to say \u201cno\u201d to a kid on occasion, or really whenever warranted. Also\u2026you\u2019re injured and your brother is fine\u2026.so??", "First of all, you got hit by a car and is definetly not in a state to hang out with a toddler. Secondly, what kinda parent is he to want to leave his child with someone with a concussion and what kind of brother is he to guiltrip his injured sister into free babysitting? What an AH.\n\nNTA Op!", "Your brother is an idiot and you can tell him to leave you alone. He can\u2019t expect you to babysit every single time he has his daughter.", "YOU GOT HIT BY A CAR THREE DAYS AGO\n\nWHAT IS WRONG WITH YOUR BROTHER?\n\nNTA", "DEFINITELY NTA. The child will definitely understand if you tell her you got a really big booboo and can't go have fun with her this week. If you're feeling up to it, maybe offer to watch TV with her but it would actually just be irresponsible for you to take on caring for a child in your current state.", "NTA as you are very impaired and in pain. It\u2019s irresponsible and inconsiderate to consider you for babysitting for awhile \n\nCan you have your parents run interference and tell him to buzz off? Meanwhile I\u2019d ignore his calls and texts and maybe block him for awhile. You need to rest to heal better", "Lol! There was a post last year about a woman who babysat her brother\u2019s kid for free. Then a close friend died and she said she needed a week break to process the grief. Her brother demanded that if she wanted time off she needed to pay the kid\u2019s daycare for the week and she was going to do it", "Nah, he wants sexy times with baby mama and make more babies for OP to babysit for free"]}
