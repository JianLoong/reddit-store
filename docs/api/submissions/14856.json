I am usually the first to want to hang out with her. But the main conflict is I do not feel good. I got hit by a car Thursday(so 3 days ago, I am counting thursday and today as a day since the crash happened early morning(8am)). I am fine besides me having a small concussion and bruises all down my body where I got hit/fell. I am also super sore, my muscles just aren't feeling the best so I can't handle a toddler at the moment. \nMy brother(M23) and his baby mama do week to week, on my brothers weekends I usually spend at least several hours with my niece, taking her to the park, out to eat, etc. \n\nI obviously can not drive with a concussion so my brother has spent all morning trying to talk me into walking to the park with her and doing my usual stuff. He's been saying that she's been talking about it all week, I'm letting her down, etc. Which I can understand, it sucks that I can't hang with her but I can hardly stand without getting dizzy as hell.  \n\nI just want to really know if I'm in the wrong?

Tell your brother to be her parent for a weekend so you can rest up like you should", "What happens when you get to the park and are sick and unable to care for your niece? \n\n**Here's the thing, there's what your brother SAYS to you about the situation and there's a bigger picture.**\n\nHe's communicating that this is what his kid wants and the impact of your refusal to go along with that. That's one part. \n\nAnother is the unspoken \"we need OP to give us a break from childcare duties\"\n\nAnother is that, rather than deliver the bad news that auntie is sick and can't come this weekend and dealing with the inevitable (and brief) upset, he's transferring the responsibility and guilt onto you. Not cool. \n\nAnother still is that you are injured and recovering (I hope that goes well for you!) Not only are you not fit to care for a child, you also need to prioritize your own care. \n\nOP, you don't need your brother to see this as you do or to agree that you are not able to care for you this week, or to be happy with the situation. **But you DO need to make the responsible decision for your niece AND yourself that he won't. ** NTA", "NTA - your brother should try and explain to your niece that you're not feeling well this weekend so you're unable to go. He should take her to the park instead so she doesn't get too upset about the entire thing.\n\nIt isn't your fault you got hit by a car", "NTA. Your brother shouldn\u2019t be making you feel bad; you are legitimately recovering and a toddler needs a lot of attention. Your brother is making you feel bad because he wants a few hours off from watching his child. They\u2019ll both get over it. Stand your ground.", "NTA you are NOT fit to be looking after any child right now, if anything it could be dangerous, what if she runs away or you pass out next to a busy road and she goes into traffic? Tell your brother to stop trying to put his daughter in danger \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f and take care of yourself, don\u2019t take on too much before you\u2019re ready", "NTA  NO IS A COMPLETE SENTENCE.

Auntie can't play today.  She's not feeling well.  We'll save it for next time, ok?\" And then IDK maybe play with his own kid today?\n\nI'm sorry, but that's not even an appropriate way to deal with staff.  You're his sister, not his servant.", "Your brother is being unreasonable, yeah i get it his daughter wants to play with her aunt, but the condition of her aunt is severely bad. NTA. Go get a rest and then play with your niece again after you feel 100% better.", "NTA\n\nHe is pressuring you, which is not fair from your brother at all. \nYou got hit by a car! Your health is prio #1 here.\nAnd as sweet as 3 y/o can be, they also can be exhausting and may not understand, why you can't play in a way u used to.\n\nInfo:\n\"My brother(M23) and his baby mama do week to week, on my brothers weekends ..\" \nDoes that mean they are seperated? \nYou said, u usually spend ours with her on his weekends.

Time for pops to do his job. Edited to ask why bro would want someone with a concussion to watch a child. That doesn't seem safe.", "NTA, your brother however is TA as he can easily spend some time with his own kid and give you the time you need to recover.", "NTA!  WTH is wrong with your brother?  I sincerely hoping that you are under a doctors care because you don't seem to realize the severity of this accident.  You SHOULD be taking time off everything to take care of yourself.  And what kind of thinking is it to have you--concussion, bruises and all--be responsible for the attention and care of a 3-year old?  The thought of it is simply ridiculous and irresponsible.\n\nYour brother is an AH.  BIG TIME!  Please take care of yourself.", "NTA, your brother could handle this very simply by telling his daughter that aunty is  feeling really unwell and really needs to rest so that she can get better. It's not hard and a great opportunity to teach kiddo very basic levels of empathy and understanding for others.. You're doing nothing wrong, hope you recover soon \ud83d\udc9b", "NTA - you are doing a favour to your brother by spending time with your niece. Even if you were totally healthy you wouldn\u2019t owe him anything, you could say no without any reason.", "Nta your brother will just have to suck it up and father his child without your help.", "NTA.  Your niece will get over it - she needs to learn anyhow that disappointments are a part of life.  Bro is out of line.\n\nHope you feel better soon!!", "NTA. You absolutely shouldn\u2019t be taking care of a toddler in your condition. No one wants to let a young family member down. Maybe just an extended FaceTime? Both you and your brother can explain to her that you are ok but healing and that you miss her and that you will heal and spend time together again like before.", "NTA, I'm so sorry you got hurt. Your brother should not want someone with a concussion watching a toddler! He is being an AH. I hope he doesn't pawn her off on you to avoid parenting time with her...\n\nFeel better soon!!", "NTA, if you brother really cares about your niece missing you, he could explain to her about your accident and bring her to bring you flowers and a card or something!!", "NTA - I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you, that must have been so scary! Focus on resting and healing right now, your body has been through a severe trauma.\n\nYour brother should be encouraging his daughter to understand that you are hurt and cannot take her to the park until you are better. I think it\u2019s a concept a 3 year old would be able to understand and be empathetic to if explained properly. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d still feel disappointment but she deserves the opportunity to understand and learn that sometimes things don\u2019t work out the way we want them to, and to process those feelings by maybe making you a get-well soon card or helping her dad make a snack for you.\n\nYour brother is being selfish and unreasonable. He is trying to guilt you and weaponize his daughter against you in spite of your injuries. He should understand that sometimes things out of our control happen and plans fall through, and that your health is much more important than a trip to the park.", "NTA - for crying out loud, you got hot by a car! You need to test and recover. He can walk his own daughter to the park. He really sucks for trying to guilt you.", "NTA  \nyou are literally recovering from an accident involving a motor vehicle, Him making promises to a 3 y/o does not mean you hop to it and \"feel better\" just because. you're 100% right that you need to rest and not take on watching a toddler, good luck OP, hopefully the trying to make you feel bad about it stops soon.", "You\u2019re 100% not the asshole. You have an injury and have just been through a very hard experience, so I think that your friend should be a bit more considerate. Try and bring this up to them next time, and as soon as you\u2019re better, you can spend some quality time with your niece!! take care <33", "NTA. Brother is.", "NTA. Either you push yourself now and feel worse in two weeks, or you take the rest you need and feel better then. The most important part of long-term childcare is taking care of yourself well enough to enjoy it.", "You are not to be held responsible for your brother's inability to grasp the concept of a concussion.", "Holy shit, NTA!! Your brother is WAY out of line here. Your niece might be sad, but kids can understand that plans change when someone is sick or hurt. Normal adults already have that understanding - WTF is wrong with your brother?", "NTA, you are injured and your brother should be able to explain to your niece that you were hurt, that you will be fine but you need to rest up. He's being a bad brother trying to put your health at risk (you sound like you'd be at least at risk of further accidents) to avoid a fairly simple explanation and mild disappointment.", "NTA. You cannot properly care for a child in your current condition. Sounds like your brother is trying to guilt you into it even though it is the wrong thing to do.", "Your brother  wants free time and a babysitter. Say no", "Nta \n\nTell your brother to use this as a learning experience.  Take his daughter to the store and get her to pick out some things to make you feel better.   It would be cute af to see what a 3 yo thinks you need.... even the dollar store would work.\n\nBring her to your house and allow her to visit.  Most likely she will try and take care of you she will completely forget about the missed time at the park.\n\nShe will learn empathy and compassion which is something this world is lacking anyways.", "I think he may have rolled off the bed one too many times as a baby!!! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I\u2019m sorry you were hurt and I\u2019m glad your ok, but maybe introduce her to some classic Disney movies with quiet time tell her that auntie has bad booboos, she may understand but not care as toddlers are bad ass and dgaf\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Taking them to the park alone can mean running after them if there is a danger, picking them up for about a billion reasons, and all sorts of physical tasks.

Your health and recovering is!  Do not let him guilt or try to gaslight you into thinking you\u2019re wrong, but your not! He is responsible to take care of and entertain his own child.
