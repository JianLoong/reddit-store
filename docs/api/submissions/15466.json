Last week my (24F) boyfriend (23M) and I went to the wedding of a close friend of his. She and her now husband are both devout Christians, which I have 0 issues with. The ceremony was nice, but this came up during the reception. Everyone was seated about to have dinner when a guest stood up at the front of the room with a microphone to say grace before the meal. While most other people had their heads down, I did not bow my head as I am not religious. I looked at the centerpiece on the table and around the venue instead. We were seated outside so there were all these fairy lights strung up and the stars were out. The prayer lasted about a minute. At the end after the amen, I looked up and noticed a wedding photographer off to the side near me, and I realized that she may have gotten me in some pictures not praying. That night after we got home, I asked my bf what he thought about it and he reassured me that the photographer probably purposely didn\u2019t have me in the photo if I wasn\u2019t praying or that they could edit me out. However, when I asked my mom about it, she said that I was being selfish and that I should\u2019ve put my head down like everyone else. Neither the bride or groom have reached out to me about it. I genuinely did not mean to stick out or anything and had I seen the photographer I would have put my head down to blend in.

I say this as a Christian woman who had someone say a blessing before the meal at my wedding.  We understand that not everyone believes the same way we do.  As long as you weren't talking, there was nothing wrong with what you did.  I highly doubt the photographer took pictures during the prayer anyway.  Please do not worry about this anymore!", "NTA. You remained respectful and even then, as you were looking at the centerpiece, your eyes were still at a downward trajectory. Also, doesn't sound like you ruined anything - a photographer would professionally make sure you aren't standing out, and it seems even if you did a bit, the bride and groom (the people who matter at the wedding) didn't care.", "Some people look up when they pray. NTA", "NTA. You were respectful; it was fine. I normally do kind of do a \u201cmoment of silence and stillness\u201d thing while others are having a religious or emotional moment that I\u2019m not part of. I want to convey my respect for their tradition, even if I\u2019m not participating, and I think people appreciate that. But it sounds to me like you weren\u2019t disruptive. It\u2019s not like you were talking or playing a game on your phone or something (which would be rude imo). You did fine.\n\nI\u2019m religious, and I would not be annoyed or upset to see someone looking around during a prayer they weren\u2019t participating in.

Hope you had fun at the wedding.", "NTA. If you are not religious I feel like it would be weird to pretend to pray. You remained quiet and respectful. \n\nYour partner is right. The photographer likely knows not to include a picture that would potentially upset people. \n\nI wouldn't be worried about it.", "NTA\n\nMany people just now their head and zone out during the long prayers. \n\nNo one knows. \n\nI once fell asleep at church.

Why should a non-religious person be expected to do so? You don't have to put on a spiritual costume or play to suit someone else's religious ideals. You weren't on your phone. You weren't talking. You weren't running around the room. You were sitting quietly and respectfully during their prayer time.

Sounds like this is all in your head, but I'd say you can relax.", "The only people who saw that you didn\u2019t have your head bowed during the prayer also didn\u2019t have their head bowed, so you are safe there.  As far as the photographs go, they won\u2019t be titled.  There isn\u2019t going to be a photo titled \u201cPrayer Time\u201d which shows everyone\u2019s head bowed down but yours.  NTA & stop worrying.", "I don\u2019t think this is a YTA or NTA situation.. I mean, it woulda been nice for you to just lower your head and look at your outfit or shoes haha but it\u2019s not your obligation to participate in faith based activities \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f as a bride, I\u2019d be upset if you did stick out in photos, but I\u2019m also not gonna force you to do anything that makes you uncomfy.", "NTA Christians can be pretty  picky though.  I never bow my head when my family prays, I don't talk or eat out of respect but I never put my head down.", "NAH. I'm one of those people sometimes I bow my head and sometimes I don't  , why? I really have no idea. I have at least tried to make it a habit to bow my head slightly and downcast my eyes. For me it more so helps me focus on the words of the person speaking (prayers, speeches or what have you). If you chose to just look at the center piece that is fine. But looking all around seems a little much to me because it just seems like it was a little disrespectful to the speaker. \n\nBut to each their own!", "NAH\n\nYou don't have to follow or do anything that doesn't fit into your beliefs.  You didn't make a scene or do anything disrespectful.  You just waited patiently.  But unless someone is coming after you for it, no one else is an AH either.", "NAH what you did wasn\u2019t technically wrong, but I was always taught to be respectful and follow others lead during prayers and practices of religions you don\u2019t practice (like covering my shoulders in a Greek Orthodox Church, wearing modest attire when visiting a mosque, and doing the sitting standing kneeling dance of Catholic Church) (as long as it\u2019s not personally harmful to you). Your mom isn\u2019t wrong to suggest it would have been appropriate to look down at the table and make your grocery list or something while everyone else is praying. No one has to know what you are thinking about. If you didn\u2019t want to stick out looking up at the fairy lights while everyone having their head bowed is a weird choice.", "Soft YTA. Your mom is right, sounds like you didn\u2019t think how your actions would be seen as disrespectful. You didn\u2019t need to look around the room, the polite thing would have been to simply lower your head without praying etc.", "A *very* mild YTA. Bowing your head and looking at your place setting or a button on your shirt isn't a big deal. You don't have to pray when you do it. It's just a way to avoid getting scolded by the busybody seated next to you.", "Yta-  I grew up semi religious, went to church twice a year. Since I\u2019m 14 I didn\u2019t went once. It would not have killed you to bow your head. You don\u2019t have to belive,fold your hands or say amen- but I feel like you coildhave given them the respect.", "If the bride and groom didn't say anything, NTA. Perhaps it might have been better to at least not look around, but once again, the bride and groom haven't said anything.", "NTA If you\u2019re quiet and respectful, there\u2019s no need to participate if you\u2019re not comfortable with it.", "NTA - as long as you were quiet and not jostling around / fidgeting like crazy or being distracting you\u2019re good. If you look down and/ or close your eyes is good, or I\u2019ll just slightly glance down with my eyes open in a focused semi- stare. \nIt\u2019s not a big deal , from a Catholic with strict religious expectations growing up", "NTA. But in the future you could close your eyes if you want to blend in without praying. People who are not religious due to this for moments of silence etc", "Oh no, not the pictures of the prayer before dinner. Those are everyone's most precious wedding photos!\n\nYou're good. NTA", "NTA, im an athiest and my moms side of the family is either agnostic or full on believers. And I never put my head down, I just stay respectfully quiet. No one gives me shit.", "NTA\n\n*Selfish*? Of course you weren't selfish. And bowing your head does not mean you are praying (if you are not a believer in who it being prayed to). People who are not believers may choose to bow their heads out of respect, or just as an automatic response when they see everyone else doing it. I've seen plenty of people not bow in church, and also at large family gatherings. No one things anything of it.", "NAH. Not everyone bows their heads when saying grace, and even if the person saying it started off with something like, \"Please bow your heads for grace...\", you weren't participating in the prayer.\n\nFrom your post, it seems like you sat still and quietly looked around during grace, which is a perfectly respectful.", "TIL God cares which way you tilt your head when you talk to him", "NTA\n\nYou don't have to put your head down for grace or any prayers anywhere for that matter.  You're not religious, but even for religious people bowing of heads during prayer is NOT a requirement", "NTA\nMy bf family is religious and often pray. I do not bow my head half the time as I am not religious. I may look down and I sometimes say amen and sometimes I do not. Do not stress it. You really didn't mean anything by it.", "NTA.\n\n\n>!However, when I asked my mom about it, she said that I was being selfish and that I should\u2019ve put my head down like everyone else.\n\n\nHow were you selfish? Of the many things someone could say selfish is not one of them. Someone might think you were *rude or disrespectful* but definitely not selfish.", "NTA. Looking around is fine. Looking at your phone is fine. People should know not everyone believes in their (or any) sky fairies. It\u2019s rude to assume otherwise.", "NTA. As long as you are quiet, respectful and not drawing attention to yourself there is no problem with not praying. You shouldn\u2019t be forced or feel ashamed for not wanting to pray either. Religion should be a personal choice, not something to push on other people.", "NTA. Why would your mother think you were selfish for not bowing your head? Does she think god refuses to listen if even one person within the general vicinity doesn\u2019t have their head bowed? Personally, I wouldn\u2019t think twice if someone did or didn\u2019t bow their head.", "As a Christian myself I would not be offended if someone didn\u2019t lower their head during prayer over a meal. Not everyone does that not even Christian\u2019s. If you were quiet and respectful there should be no issue. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it", "NTA. You were respectful of their time. But it's not your beliefs. You should not be pressured into those practices.", "Yta- it's a sign of respect - you may not follow that religion, but you can respect it. I'm an atheist - I'll still bow my head in a church and remove my shoes in a mosque", "NTA", "And you don't HAVE to bow your head during grace or prayers - *even* if you are religious, you only have to be quiet and respectuful", "She only said they were there, she didn't say she was looking up at them, although that would also be somewhat religious by looking up at God.", "You\u2019re right, I misunderstood. I pictured her looking all around, but if she was just sitting still, staring at the center piece, then I don\u2019t see why she would stick out. Definitely NTA"]}
