Being twins they were always super tight and had a bond that none of us could fully understand. Sometimes it made me feel a little sad that they were so close to each other but not us. I used to think that was the reason we weren't close but then I started to suspect it was more to do with us being half siblings and having a different dad. They were okay with us. They weren't bullying us or anything. They just never put any effort into the relationship and were always distant when we would try to get closer to them.\n\nOnce they moved out we hardly ever saw them. I maybe see them once or twice a year usually and even then it's rare for us to interact because they will say hi and move onto talking to other people or doing things. We're not on each other's social media's (though I tried). I don't have either of their numbers or anything. It's just how it is. Honestly, I stopped seeing them as half siblings a while ago and they really do feel more like my mom's other kids due to the lack of relationship.\n\nA few years ago my siblings and I wanted to go stay with them for a weekend (they lived together until a year or two ago) but they didn't want us there.

It made me sad because their cousins would have been close to my age and I didn't understand why they would spend time with them but not us.\n\nSo there's the background and I have grown to accept and understand that they don't need to be closer to us if they don't want to be. It doesn't make me sad anymore.\n\nAnyway, my parents were invited to a destination wedding and my mom asked my half siblings if one of them could let the three of us stay the four days they would be gone.

I pointed out grandma and grandpa would let us stay and she asked me why I'd say they (half siblings) never wanted us around. I told her they have never made the effort, have never kept in contact with us, and invited kids of similar ages as us to stay for sleepovers but never us.\n\nMom told me all that was the reason she should ask and try to convince them to spend the time with us.

It was hard for my older child to lose some of my attention at that age, especially because that attention was due to the physical demands of caring for young children close in age. I was less available to drive places, to host friend parties, etc. They may feel like they lost their father and then lost the mother they had. That\u2019s a lot of change at a young age.

I have older siblings that I don't really talk to often. They moved out and would keep in contact with my parents but never us specifically. So we didn't really have much of a relationship. Even now, with social media and my phone number on their phones, they still don't talk to me unless they need something like babysitting or loans. So I don't talk to them much. Your mum will end up pushing them away with her constant asking. I can see her point, she wants all her kids to have a good relationship, but it sounds really clear that they don't want to spend time with you guys. And anyway, she should have facilitated a good relationship with you all from the get go. My kids are close in age but even so I'm teaching them that we have to be kind to our siblings and treat each other with a level of respect and love and that they can go to any of us whether it's us the parents or the older siblings if they are having any issues at school or need help with something. For example I'm making breakfast before school and my 4yo needs help with her buttons so I tell her to ask her older brother and he will help her.

Or be looking after a 4 year old and a 3 year old because mum is pregnant with another baby? Because that's going to be their version of this story. I appreciate it made you sad in the past. But even now your mum wants them \"to be close to you\" because it's something she needs doing (look after her younger kids while she goes away). If you want your own relationship with your siblings, stop going via your mum. Call them for a chat, be friends on social media, and message them. Build a friendship directly between yourselves that isn't managed by your mum and doesn't depend on your mum wanting them to do something.
