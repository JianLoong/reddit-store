They're twins and they're both 28 now. Their dad died when they were 6 and mom remarried when they were 10. I (16f) came along two years later, my sister (15f) a year after me and my brother (13m) two years after her.\n\nI have never felt close to my half brother and sister. Being twins they were always super tight and had a bond that none of us could fully understand. Sometimes it made me feel a little sad that they were so close to each other but not us. I used to think that was the reason we weren't close but then I started to suspect it was more to do with us being half siblings and having a different dad. They were okay with us. They weren't bullying us or anything. They just never put any effort into the relationship and were always distant when we would try to get closer to them.\n\nOnce they moved out we hardly ever saw them. I maybe see them once or twice a year usually and even then it's rare for us to interact because they will say hi and move onto talking to other people or doing things. We're not on each other's social media's (though I tried). I don't have either of their numbers or anything. It's just how it is. Honestly, I stopped seeing them as half siblings a while ago and they really do feel more like my mom's other kids due to the lack of relationship.\n\nA few years ago my siblings and I wanted to go stay with them for a weekend (they lived together until a year or two ago) but they didn't want us there. I remember finding out through an aunt that they had some of their paternal cousins over for an entire weekend sleepover. It made me sad because their cousins would have been close to my age and I didn't understand why they would spend time with them but not us.\n\nSo there's the background and I have grown to accept and understand that they don't need to be closer to us if they don't want to be. It doesn't make me sad anymore.\n\nAnyway, my parents were invited to a destination wedding and my mom asked my half siblings if one of them could let the three of us stay the four days they would be gone. They said no and she would need to find another solution. Mom asked them a few more times and when I realized how often she was asking, I told her I thought she should stop asking. Mom asked me why and I told her they never wanted to be around us so I don't think they would want us in their space either. I pointed out grandma and grandpa would let us stay and she asked me why I'd say they (half siblings) never wanted us around. I told her they have never made the effort, have never kept in contact with us, and invited kids of similar ages as us to stay for sleepovers but never us.\n\nMom told me all that was the reason she should ask and try to convince them to spend the time with us. I told her it wasn't going to work and I didn't really want to stay with either of them now. She told me I should be appreciative and stop telling her to stop, basically.

It was hard for my older child to lose some of my attention at that age, especially because that attention was due to the physical demands of caring for young children close in age. I was less available to drive places, to host friend parties, etc. They may feel like they lost their father and then lost the mother they had. That\u2019s a lot of change at a young age.

I have older siblings that I don't really talk to often. They moved out and would keep in contact with my parents but never us specifically. So we didn't really have much of a relationship. Even now, with social media and my phone number on their phones, they still don't talk to me unless they need something like babysitting or loans. So I don't talk to them much. Your mum will end up pushing them away with her constant asking. I can see her point, she wants all her kids to have a good relationship, but it sounds really clear that they don't want to spend time with you guys. And anyway, she should have facilitated a good relationship with you all from the get go. My kids are close in age but even so I'm teaching them that we have to be kind to our siblings and treat each other with a level of respect and love and that they can go to any of us whether it's us the parents or the older siblings if they are having any issues at school or need help with something. For example I'm making breakfast before school and my 4yo needs help with her buttons so I tell her to ask her older brother and he will help her.

Or be looking after a 4 year old and a 3 year old because mum is pregnant with another baby? Because that's going to be their version of this story. I appreciate it made you sad in the past. But even now your mum wants them \"to be close to you\" because it's something she needs doing (look after her younger kids while she goes away). If you want your own relationship with your siblings, stop going via your mum. Call them for a chat, be friends on social media, and message them. Build a friendship directly between yourselves that isn't managed by your mum and doesn't depend on your mum wanting them to do something.

You seem like a wonderful, smart, kind young lady.\n\nAnd without trying to patronise you (because you do seem very mature and intelligent for your age), I hope you won't mind if I offer some potential insight and a bit of advice on the situation, from a much older lady (probably at least as old as your mum) whose nieces were in a very similar situation to you but from the other side and have managed to have a close relationship with their much-younger half-siblings . . .\n\nFirst of all, I really hope you know that none of this has anything to do with you or your younger sister and brother as people. I know you'll probably say, \"Oh I know that,\" but I think it's really important for you to hear it from someone else: those twins don't hate the person you are. They don't hear your name and think, \"Ugh, she's so awful!\" Not in the least. \n\nThey hate the situation and what you represent. They hate that once upon a time they had a family with a mum and dad, and their dad died, and it probably felt like their whole world ended. You're old enough now that i'm sure you can imagine how devastating it would be if your dad died, much less if it happened when you were small. It must have felt like the end of the world. \n\nAnd then their mum went and brought a stranger into their house (I'm exaggerating...obviously they got to know your dad, but he wasn't THEIR dad, you know? He was just . . . some person) and told them he was going to be their family. And then there were more kids. And their whole world probably felt very unstable and different, and . . . well, we normalize things like divorce and remarriage these days, but having watched it, it's shocking how little we acknowledge how destabilizing it is for kids. But none of it is about hating you as a person. I promise. Which brings us to . . .\n\nYour relationship with them. They're angry at your mum for pushing you on them. And it's lovely that you understand that. BUT, if you think that you would still like a relationship with them, you are old enough now to talk to them directly, without involving her.\n\nAnd I think it might go a long way if you said some of these things to them directly. If you told them that you understand why they would hate having you pushed on them, or your mum demanding that they have you over, because it would feel very pushy and exhausting. But that as their little sister who is now getting older, you would really like to get to know them better if they're open to that, on their terms, and that maybe when they are ready, without your mum's interference, you could plan some time to hang out. It can be up to them, and you'll understand if they need to think about it, but that you don't want it to be \"because Mom makes them\" but because it would mean a lot to you personally.

While you may not have pushed for a relationship I heavily suspect that your mom put a lot of pressure on them to build one and it made them resent you two or at minimum heavily dislike the idea. They were pre teen girls when your sister came into the picture, then you. There were alot of changes going on in their lives, and they were probably still grieving pretty badly at that point. They likely weren\u2019t given the opportunity to accept it at their own pace and adjust.

It\u2019s also rude in general; even if you two were really close, it\u2019s not their responsibility to take the responsibility to care for two for however many days or even a day. She really needs to think through her actions, if she doesn\u2019t stop she\u2019ll force the twins to cut contact completely.\n\nI hope you know that you did nothing wrong and that there\u2019s nothing wrong with you. It\u2019s just a shit situation all around. It hasn\u2019t nothing to do with  you not being person worth knowing, there were just a lot of factors beyond your and even their control. From the trauma of their dad dying, getting \u201creplacement\u201d dad, they\u2019re being a significant age gap, and that they\u2019re just have a different bond as twins. I have twin sister, and cousins that are twins too. They naturally just have a very strong bond. I make a strong effort to be in my sisters lives but we just aren\u2019t strongly bonded because our dynamic is different than the one they have with each other. There\u2019s also a decent age gap between them and me too. That\u2019s also not to mention they spent years together, years worth of memories before you two were born. By the time you were you were too young for them to build a real relationship with.\n\nThen when you add the possibility that your mom pushed too hard & (maybe) the possibility that they were forced watch you/babysit when they didn\u2019t want to (when you were really young) it just builds resentment. Neither of you are necessarily wrong, you just happened to pay the price for the circumstances you were all in. You\u2019re right to focus on yourself and not putting any weight into that relationship or lack thereof.

I've had one sister who I haven't spoken to in about 15 years randomly add me on social media in the last few weeks and I've reached out and she responded but nothing in about a month. One sister who messages every birthday and Christmas, and one sister (who is full siblings with the two boys) who has notions to try and be involved but then stops very promptly and doesn't respond to me at all, but will talk to my other sister who has the kids that I am close with. So believe me when I say, I know what it's like to feel like your family doesn't want you or care. \n\nIt's not fair on anyone for your mum to try and push any of you into an awkward situation.

She isn't doing you a favour and you absolutely do not need to act appreciative for someone trying to force an unpleasant experience. \n\nYour older siblings however need to buck up their ideas also. You 3 are the innocent party, you haven't done anything to them and they WILL realise how much they've missed out when important life events happen like weddings and babies etc. \n\nKeep telling your mum to stop. She will eventually stop. I've recently turned around to my own mother and said \"why should I bother trying to make a relationship work when they clearly don't give a shit about me\". It's so damaging on your mental health to try force these relationships and i promise you it will not help.\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this. I know it sucks. It's never a nice feeling knowing your own siblings don't want you around.", "NTA. And I don't think there are any in this situation. I'm sure Mom knows the twins' feelings. It sounds like she is in denial, trying over & over to make it go away. But I don't believe it's malicious, just wishful. I applaud OP trying to help Mom see reality.\nAs far as the twins go, it's understandable why they feel this way. After Dad died, Mom got a new family. One that they didn't feel much of a part of. That's how it felt to them. \nThis whole situation is sad but there's nobody to really blame. Mom should stop trying to force a relationship. And my advice to OP is to continue to ask Mom to stop. Then, once Mom has stopped, you & your younger sibs could reach out to the twins without any parental involvement. See how that goes. But take it slow, & with time you never know.

I haven't seen any comments that are blasting them yet (though I haven't scrolled far at all), but I think it's important to understand the twins' side of things. Perhaps the twins see the newer kids as \"replacements\" for their lost family member (dad). All in all, they shouldn't be forced to be close with their younger half-siblings if they don't want to, and they don't sound like they're being mean, just want to exercise their right not to be friends with people they clearly don't feel a connection to. \n\nAlso, sorry to hear about your mom and her husband's treatment of you.

I'm not a twin, but I trauma bonded with my brother who is one year younger than me when we lost our mother as kids. And while I love my much younger half-siblings (and my step-mom), the age gap is huge. They were still little when I went to college, got a job, married, had my own kids, moved across the country, etc. I even had some resentment issues for being forced to babysit when they were babies and toddlers and having my teenage life upended because I had to match a toddler's bedtime schedule (it's a whole mess and my relationship with my father isn't great because of it).\n\nIt's only now, as the youngest is hitting high school, that I'm bonding with them again. They're old enough for more adult conversations, plus we can text now, but honestly I'm bonding unevenly. My half-sister has more similar interests as I do, so we've spent more time chatting, etc. My two half brothers, I've chatted with some. I wish them happy birthday, but it hasn't been as effortless. I may never have the same relationship with them as my half-sister, and that's okay. They have their own lives and friends, and really we still live on separate sides of the US, so timezones and long travel and all that. I haven't seen them and my parents in three years. \n\nBut yeah, at 28 I would have NOT been interested in hosting my much younger half-siblings. Didn't mean I hated them, but I just wasn't interested (plus lack of space). My father pushing that would have destroyed what's left of my relationship with him.\n\nI hope, OP, with time that relationships can be forged for you and your siblings on your own terms. But if it doesn't, I wouldn't be surprised. The age gap really makes it seem like two separate families, and they may struggle with that (I know I did). \n\nBest of luck, OP!", "NTA... your mom will lose her kids if she keeps trying to force and push a relationship she will miss the wedding because she isn't looking for alternatives....", "She thinks if she pushed more y'all would have been closer?

The oldest two often take the youngest (a 20 and 15-year age gap) out for ice cream or to the park, etc. Sometimes just getting them involved in family activities or in helping with the younger siblings (but not abusing their help for free childcare) can increase empathy and form bonds.

I'm not saying your half-siblings would treat you poorly or anything, but if your grandparents are willing to take you for those four days, that seems the better option. \n\nI'd always choose to go somewhere that I'm definitely wanted instead of a place where I'm kinda wanted or not wanted at all", "NTA - but your mom is, she should respect their no and she\u2019s not, the fact that she\u2019s so comfortable ignoring what they want makes it appear that this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s stomped on their boundaries. \n\nI would guess in addition to your mom\u2019s lack of comprehending what \u201cno\u201d means, their dad probably plays a part. As someone who also lost a dad young, I\u2019d guess that being around you guys could be hard because it\u2019s a reminder that he\u2019s gone and your mom moved on and created a new family (which she is allowed to do, but still totally valid for them to struggle with) and the cousins are reminders that he lived.\n\nI may be totally off the mark, but maybe not.", "Dang. This is sad. I've got two little half sisters that me and my two brothers would move the world for, and the age difference is similar to yours (me and oldest sis are 13 years, younger is 16 years apart). I can't imagine not having that relationship, much less just being... indifferent. I'm sorry you're having to deal with that - but NTA. You're right and your mom is trying to force something that can't really be forced.", "NTA\n\nAppreciative of what? Her interfering on your behalf without any of your consent?\n\nShe seems to be completely oblivious to how detrimental her constant interference really is. Not regarding them, but with regards to her relationship with YOU. Unwanted \u201chelp\u201d isn\u2019t a good thing, certainly not in this instance", "No, you are not the problem. Actually except for your Mom being so unaware of your childhood there is no problem. There may be a family dynamic that set your path and theirs. When your Mom and Dad were beginning your happy little family. Their Dad had died, their Mother  was who they had left. But Mom had 3 more babies closely , this would be a busy time, also maybe the twins felt a bit displaced, don't know. Simply allow them their peace. Tell your Mom to lay off, she tried, they said no, it's over for now.", "It\u2019s a tough situation, I completely understand her and you. She would love to have a united family and you would rather not be with people who don\u2019t want to have anything to do with you. You could show your mom this thread and get her to understand that it\u2019s best to let it go.", "INFO: Why do you think you would be the A?", "You're not wrong. However, you're not going to be able to change your mother's mind about this. She's going to remain convinced that she knows best, and if she's very lucky she won't hurt her own relationship with her oldest children in the process.\n\nYou're NTA. I think you'd still be well advised to stop talking to her about this, though. This is not worth starting a fight with your mother about, not when you're still living at home.", "NTA you are more mature than me, that\u2019s for sure. I\u2019m also someone who can\u2019t imagine having a sibling (half or full it doesn\u2019t matter to me) that I don\u2019t have a relationship with.\nMy sister and I are 6 years apart full siblings but we\u2019re best friends and she is actually my caregiver now we are  31 and 37 and I\u2019m disabled.\nI hope your mom stops pressing the issue though because unless it happens organically it\u2019s going to create more resentment.", "No, but your siblings are. Just like my older siblings. The age difference is too far and they probably blame you somehow.", "INFO how is the relationship between your dad and the twins.", "NTA. This is a very sad, but fairly normal situation for parents (especially moms) who remarry after a parents death. Ur half-siblings don't want anything to do with anything from ur mom's second marriage. They have that right. But ur mom clearly can't, or won't, accept that. The more she pushes, the more she risks them going no contact with her. She's gonna have to abandon the fantasy of happy family sooner or later.", "So in a period of 5 years your mother remarried and had 3 children back to back. Your older siblings went from being preteens with no other siblings to having little siblings. They were 12, 13 and 15  when each of you were born. I could see how after losing their father and not connecting with your father that they would have felt pushed aside by your mother because all her energy and attention would have been going to you 3 and your father. Don\u2019t know if your mother made them babysit you 3. But I can imagine that the twins saw you 3 as the kids who took their only parent away. I can see why they didn\u2019t want anything to do with the children that replaced them. Instead of pushing for the twins to take care of you, she should be asking what their feelings about you 3 and ask them if they feel like she abandoned them. This issue is really about your mother and her moving on and having another family. It\u2019s not really about you and your siblings as people, it\u2019s about your older siblings losing their family multiple times. They lost their family  when their father died, when your mother remarried and when you and your younger siblings were born.  There is clearly alot of loss and trauma they have dealt with. Unfortunately this has resulted in them being closed off to you and your siblings. Encourage your mother to do family therapy just with the twins so they can safely be honest with your mother about the impact of her remarrying and having more children. NTA", "NTA - your mom trying to force them to have a relationship with you isn't going to work", "Your mom needs to leave it alone and stop trying to force a relationship on her older kids. They may eventually show interest but for now it's not going to happen.  Her intent is well meant but NO WAY for now. It would be awkward for y'all", "They were 12 when you were born?  Yea a lot of preteens to teens want nothing to do with babies and toddlers.  You could easily have been full blood and still no relationship.  \n\nMy sister is 8 years younger, full blood, nothing in common, no relationship.  We may have had more of one as adults our parents been happy/stayed together so that we organically spent time together during holidays but way divorce happened we rarely are in same places.\n\nYou aren\u2019t even adults yet for that to even be a possibility.  Most teens are annoying if you don\u2019t already have a bond.  I don\u2019t think you are putting nearly enough understanding to the age difference. Without strong bonds built earlier or significant things in common there\u2019s zero reason they\u2019d want to be around you unless they put \u201cblood family bonds\u201d on a pedestal.  The cousins your age probably had some good times with them before, without the burden of the bad times you (completely innocently!) brought just by being an annoying baby while they were teens.\n\nThe timing blows\n\nNTA tho for telling your mom to stop. Trying to force relationships doesn\u2019t work well", "NTA.  At this point it would be awkward af if they did say yes and you had to spend a whole weekend in their space.  Hard pass.", "NTA there\u2019s a literal decade between you and your half siblings, it sucks but it it is what it is.", "NTA. If anything your mom is making it worse. They probably think you and your siblings have something to do with your mom consistently asking.", "Sometimes that is what happens. Concentrate on others & just forget them. You deserve a good life away from them. You only need one asshole.", "NTA and if your mom pushes it with them it will make it worse for you because they'll be under the impression you're pushing for it.", "NTA. The only person who sucks here is your mum. Your older half siblings aren\u2019t arseholes either. I can see it from both sides.", "Agreed. NTA but this does make me sad for you. My daughter\u2019s half siblings are 12 and 13 years older than she is. They didn\u2019t even live with us full time. Their relationship is obviously different with each other than with my daughter, but they\u2019re still sweet to her. My stepdaughter even stayed with my daughter when we went on a trip and occasionally babysits for us because she\u2019s at a nearby college. It\u2019s too bad your half siblings have no desire for a relationship.", "Every comment makes it sound like she's been ramming this down the twins'throats for years. No information in the post says this is a consistent thing. If I was the mom I'd be pretty shocked to hear that the twins are having their other cousins over but can't be bothered to even interact with half-siblings beyond a hello. Whether or not it will make anything better is another matter, but damn, those are some mean twins.", "What your mom is doing is going to result in the exact opposite of what she wants to happen.\n\nI'm sorry that you are not as close as you would like to be.  12 years is a huge gap growing up.  And if your mom tried to force them to babysit, that would have caused them to push away from you.\n\nDon't lose heart.  Text them once in a while.  Eventually, you will also be an adult and the older you get, the more the age gap doesn't matter.  You may find that someday you'll have more of a relationship.  Plus, maybe they'd be more open to just having you visit rather than 3 teenagers.  3 teenagers is a LOT.", "From age gap twin might think spend time with op and sister is babysitting for mom. Teenage usually don't want to do anything with toddlers unless you grow up with toddlers when you still young. And they always distance themselves from op why mom is shocking now.", "Well, when it is an emergency, the equation changes to be about the safety/wellbeing of 3 teens they are related to and not whether they want to be close or friendly with you all; so maybe they still dont want to take you in, but unless things are already beyond repair between them and your mom, it is reasonable to expect they would try to be helpful in some way", "Im not lying when I dont talk to vegans about how much I enjoy meat, Im just avoiding potential conflict. I feel it is the same here. I took OP's feelings (not resenting the twins and not wanting her to push them away from her) from OP's own replies so I dont think saying so to their mom is lying either.\n\nIt absolutely isnt OP's job to do anything about this, but she wants to stop her mom from asking, which is the only reason for making suggestions to deescalate", "A 12-15 year gap with nothing in between is pretty major. It's different if you have one kid, another one 5 years later, another one 4 years after that, and another one 4 years after. The total gap is the same, but you have kids that effectively grew up with each other. The oldest was still a little kid when the first sibling came along, still a kid when the next one came, and they'd have been building relationships with their siblings for years. \n\nIn this case, the twins grew up with each other, but no other siblings. By the time OP came along, the twins has already moved into the phase of their life where they're starting to think of future plans, being independent, etc. By the time the youngest came along, they were already either out of the house or well on their way. It doesn't mean they can't have a relationship, but they don't have the one that comes automatically with most siblings", "Yet very common based on what we see on here.", "Your dad sounds like kind of a jerk. You can always meet when he's 18.", "Absolutely not. They have been very clear that they don't want a relationship with OP. If OP were to go around that and get their numbers from mom, that would be yet another disrespect of their wishes.", "What a weird analogy!\n\nOP is absolutely allowed to not want to be where she is not welcome, but it is not her job to make her mother listen to her.\n\nThe twins DON'T want her and her mother needs to accept that. OP spoke her truth.", ">Age gap or not, this is too much apathy between siblings. It\u2019s sad.\n\nIt might be sad, but that doesn't mean OP's parents could have done anything about it.\n\nSome kids just aren't open to accepting much younger half-siblings.  The dynamics of the divorce/death, their personalities, whatever it is.  You can't *force* a sibling relationship.", "No really, there is that big a gap between my husband and his young half brother and they're very close but it happened naturally - he was actually excited to have a younger brother come into the family.  Maybe because they loved their stepdad so much???  Maybe the older boys didn't adjust well to their father's death and felt he, and possibly they, were being replaced with a new family so simply held onto each other and didn't want to let each other in.\n\nOf course NTA for not wanting to go where you're not wanted.", "I'm 11 years older than my sister...and we are extremely close...I would do anything for her and she for me...\nYes, when I was 21 and she was 10, we had nothing in common, but I still would do anything for her no matter what age we were. \ud83d\ude0a\u2764\ufe0f\n\nHer older half siblings, even though they are older, could get to know the kids now...if they truly wanted to...", "This is where I\u2019m at as well. The age difference alone is often a cause for distance. Add in that they are twins that lost their dad and it\u2019s entirely understandable.", "Yep. My full sister is 13yrs older and we don't have a sibling relationship. Now my parents never forced me on her and when she moved out at 18 she had me over a lot but as I got older, we grew farther apart. She feels like an older cousin.", "I mean in all reality, what does a 12-year-old have in common with a 2-year-old? Obviously y'all weren't going to be getting along so great. You see that with full siblings too! When there's a joint gap like that, they don't often have the kind of bond that siblings in a similar age bracket do. I hope she doesn't make it out to them like it's your idea to push this. Because I'm sure that makes it worse for you", "Any chance she forced them to babysit you a lot? Because that could have left them with some resentment that maybe asking to come sleep over and stay the weekend feels like being asked to be a free babysitter for your mom.", "One respectful and clear text is not disrespectful imo, especially if they never text them again.", "I wouldn't care about that when it comes to texting", "Don't do it. I don't know what your half-siblings' personalities are like, but if I were to make it clear that I didn't want a relationship with someone, and then they went around my wishes and got my contact information anyway, I would be extra pissed off. \n\nBesides, how would that play out? \"I'm sorry mom tried to push you into contact with me, so I'm pushing into direct contact with you even though I know you don't want it to apologize for her\"", "You can't worry about that. Just send your message. And I'd use that message to also tell them how shitty their behavior has been your whole life and how much it hurts.", "The truth isnt always the same as what gets you results you want.", "That is very kind of your dad. Sounds like he did his best to make sure you had a relationship with your mom, so it's just so unfortunate that your mom is hurting that relationship with her actions.", "They could write something like \u201chey I know we don\u2019t have a close relationship but I wanted to give you my contact info in case of emergencies. I\u2019m sorry mom is trying to push us on you two, I\u2019m trying to get her to stop. I won\u2019t text you again but I just wanted to let you know.\u201d", "Op doesn't want contact with the twins. Mom is pushing. OP is not going to the twins because they don't want her either.\n\nEveryone but MOm is happy, but Mom is an AH.", "It's not lack of empathy. It's life and timing and not required. OP is not worried about it, neither should you be!", "OP wants mom to stop asking the twins.\n\nTelling mom the twins dont want them got mom to push the twins more. How is suggesting a way to help OP get mom to stop bad?"]}
