{"id": 8859, "submission_id": "10qxv7b", "title": "AITA for not giving my late husband's belongings to my in laws?", "selftext": "I (F33) lost my husband very unexpectedly 7 years ago. We knew each other from a very young age and married when we graduated college. I have known his family for almost my entire life and they are the closest I have to actual family (my own family situation has always been difficult ). I became very close with his parents in particular (I will still call my \"in laws\" in this post) and we supported each other heavily through the grief process. We didn't have children before he passed, but we were trying. I still miss my husband every day.\n\nI began slowly dating again 4 years ago - mostly casual dates and nothing serious. In laws were broadly supportive. I told them I was ready to date and they said OK, but didn't want to know the details. I only ever spoke about my dating life vaguely and infrequently to them.\n\nAround the same time, I got a big promotion and began to spend a couple months a year in Paris for work (pandemic permitting). Then 1 year ago, I met Armand (M38) and started my first serious relationship since being widowed. Given Armand lives in Paris, our relationship is based there and while we have travelled quite a lot together, we haven't been to the US together yet. He hasn't met my in laws, but I have told them I am dating someone.\n\nAround Christmas, we found out I was pregnant. This was a total surprise as we weren't trying. We have since decided that I will move to France permanently instead of splitting my time between the US and France, so that we can raise a family together. It isn't really possible for Armand to move to the US - he works in the art industry and his studio and backers are all Europe based.\n\nI told my in laws and they were deeply upset. They said I was depriving them of their only opportunity to have a grandchild (my husband was an only child). They then accused me of moving on too quickly and not loving my husband. In the end, we had a huge argument and they have demanded that I leave all my husband's belongings from our apartment (his clothes, personal effects, etc) to them when I move to Paris. They also demanded my engagement ring, which is a family heirloom. They said they should have these because while I have moved on, he will never stop being their son.\n\nI said no, these things are all treasured memories from my life with him that I never want to forget. They have threatened legal action to recover the ring in particular. I'm not sure they have a proper legal right. But I can see the hurt I'm causing them with my choices and maybe giving them what they ask for, they will be able to have closure. AITA for continuing to refuse?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT: In response to comments:**\n\n* After the funeral, I already gave many of my husband's possessions to my in laws. What I kept were some clothes that reminded me of happy times, things with his handwriting on it, memories from trips, etc. I want to keep these. It's not like I will be lugging a huge amount of things to Paris. I don't think it's unreasonable that I keep these. They're memories WE made, not with his parents.\n* The ring is trickier... but it is the biggest reminder to me of the relationship we once had. It really breaks my heart to give it away.", "created_utc": 1675266327, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10qxv7b/aita_for_not_giving_my_late_husbands_belongings/", "score": 544, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Any future kids that you have will not be part of their family so it will no longer be a family heirloom if you keep it. It's your choice, one way or another, but I can see why they would want that.\n\n>I can see the hurt I'm causing them with my choices and maybe giving them what they ask for, they will be able to have closure.\n\nIf they wanted closure they'd have it. You can't give someone else closure and it's not your responsibility.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t divorce your husband, he passed away. The person you chose to spend your life with, and that was taken from you way too soon. He was taken from them too soon as well. \n\nPersonally, I would try to find a compromise, which may be giving them the ring and you keeping the rest, or finding a couple things of sentimental value and giving them those. But ultimately, this was your husband, these are your memories with him, and you will never stop loving him just because you have found someone else to love as well. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss, and wish you all the best in your new chapter.", "NTA\n\n> I was depriving them of their only opportunity to have a grandchild (my husband was an only child)\n\n... so that boat sailed seven years ago?", "NTA\n\n5 years is plenty of time. So sorry for your loss.\n\nTechnically, not their grandchild either way but they are allowed to express their hurts without being AHs", "I'm going to say NTA, but even then I don't think its a fair assessment. This just sounds like bad situation all round with no clear high ground.\n\nHowever, the 'depriving them of a grandchild' is a strange statement. What if the new husband feels weird about having your previous husband's parents in that role? \n\nThe 'moving on too fast' is entirely subjective. Its been 7 years, you waited 3 before dating again. Some people would call that too long, some would say its not enough. It all depends on who you are as a person and how you handle grief. \n\nThe ring is the really tough situation. On the one hand it belongs to you. As you said, if he was still alive, it would be yours. Its not like you got divorced and are keeping it. On the other hand, it is a family heirloom. But back again to the first hand, they have no other children, so there is one else to pass it on to. I'm not really sure there is a 'correct' outcome to that situation.", "NTA\nI can sort of understand the engagement ring, since it was a family heirloom, but because you are now happy again doesn't mean you've forgotten your husband or don't love him. But he is gone, and if he was a good person, he would like to see you happy again.\nThe only ones \"depriving\" then of a grandchild are they themselves, as you seem more than willing to keep them in your life.", "NTA - First, this is a hard situation to be going through, especially with people you consider family being the way they are towards you.  Everyone processes grief differently and unfortunately his parents are putting you in a very awkward position.\n\nIn the eyes of the law the ring was a gift from your husband to you.  While it is a family heirloom, the parents have zero claim over it as you were next of kin to your husband when he passed. As your husband was an only child, have you asked what happens to the ring when his parents pass? This is such a difficult position to be in and I\u2019m sure you cherish every memory you have but I would seriously consider returning just the ring to them.\n\nThe fact that they think you\u2019re depriving them of a grandchild is asinine.  You\u2019re starting to live your life again and move past your grief.  Did they seriously expect you to be single forever? I\u2019m baffled by the fact that they don\u2019t want you moving on but they want a relationship with your child.  \n\nAs far as the belongings from your time with your husband, keep them.  They are memories of someone you lost.  I can\u2019t believe people are actually telling you not to.  It\u2019s not like you broke up or got divorced.  He passed away, you kept some things that reminded you of the good times and gave his parents other things.  His parents are being extremely unreasonable.\n\nAs I type this I\u2019m realizing that they may be reacting the way they are because you are their last connection to their only child and you\u2019re moving to another country.  I\u2019m guessing they won\u2019t get to see you much or at all once you move.  I would sit down and talk to them.  Try not to get mad but ask them to consider your feelings too and do the same for them.  Hopefully you all can have a meaningful conversation and figure things out.", "NTA that is your thing! And you would still be married to him if he didn\u2019t die sadly for everyone \ud83d\udc94\ud83d\ude22 If they sit back and think, they are the ones depriving themselves of this grandchild! There is no reason they could not have flown to Paris to see them. They need some more grief counselling. \nFor what? Stuff? That ring is yours that was given to you in love. What you do with it is your choice not theirs. \nCongrats on the baby and best of health to you both. Family is who we choose and you had chose them\ud83d\ude22 what a shame.", "NTA \n\nRespectfully, they need therapy to process their grief.", "NTA. Keep that ring. It is legally yours now and they have no rights to it there. You have also been pretty accommodating to them and they are being beyond selfish here basically because you are leaving them behind. Or that's the way they see it. They aren't respecting the fact that you'll always miss their son too and honestly it's not going to ever be their grandchild. Not by blood anyway. It's been at least 4 years and you have every right to find happiness and move on. Good luck \ud83e\udd1e", "NTA here but do you really want to haul your late husband's stuff to Paris?\n\nLet them have his clothes, but keep the things that actually mean something to you. Maybe that's the ring, some pictures, and mementos.\n\nArmando and you will be navigating a life together combining your households, etc. \n\n>They then accused me of moving on too quickly and not loving my husband.\n\nWe all know this isn't true. They are just I'm shock, and, I'm sure, wrapping their head around you having a baby with someone who is not their son.\n\nCongratulations and good luck, OP!", "NTA - it's okay to let go of some of his things. You're moving to France to be with a different man. A box or two is okay to keep. But realistically, you're starting a new life with someone who might not want constant reminders of your late husband. Your in-laws are out of line. I might consider giving the ring back, but I'm not sure that legally you have to. It was given to you and the promise was fulfilled, even if it was short. Keep the things that are most significant to you, let them have the rest.\n\nJust because you have moved on, doesn't mean you didn't love your husband or still love him. Take what your in-laws say with a grain of salt, because I think having you permanently move to France might be a trigger for renewed grief. After all, now they're losing you too and might not see you again. Grief makes us do weird things.", "NTA completely\n\nThe hardest thing a parent can do is lose a child, especially if that child was their only one.  Their chance for a grandchild ended when their son passed away.  It\u2019s ok for you to keep his personal belongings.  The ring is a family heirloom.  That I would return because it could go to a cousin or other blood family member.", "NTA but it would be a kindness if you returned some items of his to them, particularly those of sentimental value to them. If you wanted to be truly magnanimous, you could return the ring, but no one should think less of you if you didn't (and it belongs to you 100%, legally and ethically).", "NTA - you have moved on, as you should. Your baby (congrats btw) is not their grandchild. It sounds like they have not processed their grief and channeling it all onto you. Sure it makes sense to ask for a few items as keepsakes but \u2026 all his stuff? Your ring? No. They need to go to therapy and let you move on.", "NTA\n\nYour loss is just as real as theirs but they shouldn't expect you to remain a widow forever. They should be happy you've found someone new to share your life with. \nAs for the ring, what would they do with it since your late husband was their only child? Also, it became yours the day he gave it to you, I don't think they have any legal rights to it", "NTA. You were part of their son\u2019s \u201c living memory\u201d. The ring is just pettiness", "NTA. Your edit says you gave them things after the funeral so you aren\u2019t obligated to give them anything else. They are not able to get passed their sons death and hate that you are moving on with someone else.", "NTA.  Their reaction is way out of line. Four years is more than enough time to mourn your husband's death.  That having been said, I'm wondering how Armand is going to react to you dragging all your husband's belongings overseas and into his place. I understand holding onto a few small keepsakes (like your engagement ring), but it seems impractical and spiteful to hold onto all his clothes and personall effects. Moving on also means letting go.", "I\u2019m gonna be in the minority and say NTA. \n\nYou didn\u2019t get into a relationship for several years after your husband died. \n\nIf there are things you are wanting to downsize on to move across the world that belonged to your husband, I would suggest giving them to his parents - I don\u2019t see why you would need a closet full of his clothes or all his childhood accomplishments, etc. \n\nBut the ring: the family ends with them. Your husband was gifted the ring to give to you, and I don\u2019t think he would want you giving it back. If they consider your child their \u201cgrandchild\u201d (which is both kind and a little weird), they would want it to go to that child one day, would they not? \n\nKeep in touch with them when you move and give them what you can. But he wasn\u2019t just their son, he was also your husband. Life is for the living, you\u2019re allowed to move on and live your life.", "you waited 3 years i don\u2019t think that\u2019s too soon, maybe give them a couple things that you wouldn\u2019t need to take. they\u2019re understandably hurt but they can\u2019t dictate what you do NTA", "NTA. I have some very personal experience with this kind of situation and your late husband's parents are being completely unreasonable. Could you throw them a bone and at least give them the ring back? Eh, perhaps. But if you don't you are NTA and their actions and words are incredibly hurtful. Losing a spouse, especially when you're young and it is unexpected, is a deeply traumatic event. How you choose to grieve and move on with your life is something that is your business and your business only. It is none of the business of your (former) in-laws. The child you're having is not their grandchild and their actions are all but ensuring that they won't be a part of your life going forward. \n\nIt's up to you to decide how much of a sentimental value that ring holds, and whether it will continue to hold that value to you. But regardless of whether you give it back, by threatening legal action these people have shown that they don't deserve to be part of your life.", "NTA also do not understand all the comments about returning the ring. Keep it, they are only asking for it 7 years later out of pettiness. It\u2019s your memory of him", "NTA, but maybe since it's a family heirloom,ask who they would like to pass the ring on to and put it in your will for it to pass to that person.", "I'm trying to figgr out how you having a child now would make them the grandparents?", "NTA\n\nThe ring was given to you, you married your husband, which fulfilled the \"contract\" the ring symbolized. They have no legal right to the ring. You and your husband did not divorce, he died.\n\n>They said I was depriving them of their only opportunity to have a grandchild \n\nIf they truly feel this way, then the ring can be passed down to your child.", "NTA.   But I'd  give them the ring. \n\nAre you going to pack up all his things  and move them to Paris?\n\nProbably  not.   Keep the things that mean the most and give his parents some. \n\nYou deserve to be happy.", "NTA\n\nNot a lawyer, but I do know you're the next of kin.  I doubt they'd win much in a court.  But, that's not the point.  You absolutely should take with you what's meaningful for you, and that could include the ring.  It would also be very kind of you to give some of the stuff to your in laws.  Do you really need everything?  I'm sure there's stuff there that you could share with them.  You lost your husband, they lost their son.", "NTA - they will never get over the loss of their son or the loss of their ability to have grandchildren. In a more perfect world you may want to include them as a third set of grandparents since they were a big part of your life for probably 20 years.\n\nIf there\u2019s things you don\u2019t want in your husbands things then I would offer those, but i don\u2019t think you would be expected to give it all to them. \n\nThe ring is tricky, I would keep it since there doesn\u2019t seem to be anyone else to pass it on to. If there is another cousin or something, you may entertain the idea of giving it back. Not required though in my opinion.\n\nBottom line, if they can\u2019t accept that you have found another love and family, it won\u2019t work out. You only get one life and it\u2019s not right for family to be upset that you found a second chance at a family.", "NTA. He died 7 years ago and it hurt you deeply you were only able to try dating again 4 years ago. That's a long time. I don't think they really believed that since they have known you forever and had accepted you as part of the family. I think, theyre talking from a place of pain. That's understandable, because not only is their son gone, now you would be too. However, it was wrong for them to accuse you of these things as it surely havent been easy to you either. Your husband's belonging is definitely a hard subject to approach. The clothes, if it were me, i'd probably leave a lot of it behind and keep only a few pieces that best reminds me of him, same with personal effects.  Gifts should definitely be kept. Those are memories shared between you two afterall. But the engagement ring? I wont even budge on that. Heirloom or not, that engagement ring was a proof of his love for you. It was given to him as a birthright and he gave it to you. It was the closest manifestation of love between you two and it must be painful that theyre trying to get it from you. I can see why theyre hurting now that youre leaving but asking back for the engagement ring is a bit too much imo.\n\nPutting aside legal matters, they can ask but they should respect your choice.", "NAH. Everyone grieves differently. In laws are still grieving their son, and now also grieving the perceived loss of you and your child. It\u2019s clear they viewed you as close family just as you view them. Do your best to sit down and discuss the future with them when listening not just speaking. It is entirely up to you what belongings of your first husbands you keep. Don\u2019t let anyone else tell you how to grieve. You\u2019re not \u201cmoving on\u201d you\u2019re moving forward. The love you have for him isn\u2019t being replaced by the love you have for Armand. And you\u2019ll still have days where you grieve your loss deeply.", "NTA. \n\nYou were given the ring by your husband because he wanted you to have it. They are just being petty. If they had another child, I'd maybe say fine but it's literally just to deprive you of it.", "I am conflicted about the ring. How does Armand feel about your late husband\u2019s ring?  Do you wear it daily?  Did your late husband give you any other jewelry or sentimental personal items? Do you have to return it immediately or can you agreed to return it eventually?", "NTA. \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss, and I'm so happy that you were able to find love again, I'm sure the memory of your late husband will forever remain part of you. \n\nAs for the ring, I don't agree with the people who say to give it back. Your late husband gifted it to you when he proposed (so I'm pretty sure the legal action is just a bluff) and yes I do think they are asking for it back out of pettiness.\n\n>They said they should have these because while I have moved on, he will never stop being their son.", "They think 7 years is too soon to move on???\n\nNTA and best wishes for your happiness in your new life.\n\nEdited to add: consider returning the ring, although you don\u2019t have to. It\u2019s a family heirloom, and realistically, although it has deep sentimental meaning to you what will you do with it? You won\u2019t be wearing it. Maybe there\u2019s another family member they can eventually pass it on to.", "NTA. Do not give them your ring. They have no legal standing for it. I also wear an heirloom ring. I would never give mine. Never. I would not give up that piece of my husband. They can pry it from my cold dead hands.", "NTA! You may wish to give them some belongings as it will be difficult to take everything to France. However, you should definitely keep the biggest symbol of the love you shared: **YOUR** Engagement Ring. They gave it to him so he could give it to you. Things would be different had you divorced, but he passed away. \n\nAs you move on in life, it is completely understandable that you keep **YOUR** Engagement Ring as the symbol of the love you shared.  You could agree to will that it be returned to his family if you so choose. That is entirely up to you. \n\nMy Best Wishes to you as you enter the next chapter of your life.", "NTA, but I'm asking you to consider this. I strongly believe that your new husband is NOT going to want a bunch of reminders of your deceased husband floating around.  A wedding ring, some photos, a favorite sweater ... sure. But it's unrealistic to think you're going to move to Paris with all your deceased husband's clothes and personal effects, and just treasure them forever. You're going to end up getting rid of them. Why not \"get rid of them\" to your former in-laws. Good luck with this situation. It sounds as if for years you and your in-laws meant a lot to each other. I hope you can all put this recent upset behind you.", "NTA\n\nI would at least give them back the ring. However, if you are moving to Paris are you really going to have room for a bunch of your late husband's stuff? If you are going to downsize and get rid of anything of his you should offer it to his parents.", "Since the ring is a family heirloom and seeing that there is no one to pass it along to (you have no kids together), you should give the ring back, so it stays with the family it was meant to be in. It can be passed along to another family member so the heirloom can continue its journey. While it does have sentimental value to you, it has even more for the bloodline family. You have your wedding ring which is the important ring for you to treasure.\n\nThe family is going through the motions. They aren't right in how they are coming off. They could be a bit more compassionate- and so could you. You have to accept that you moving on is going to lead to more change. That what you once held dear will become more of a memory that you look back on fondly. Your world will continue to move forward with a new spouse and child. His parents' life isn't going to match your journey and they want to hold on to what they can of their son (which is absolutely okay). \n\nThe ring should absolutely be going back to the family though. No matter how you feel about it being given to you, the heirloom is meant to be passed on to a future generation family member at some point. (Which again isn't possible in this case because you two never had a child together). You are moving on and your family is now with a whole other bloodline family. The heirloom ring is not meant to be with that family at any point.", "NTA. This is a tough one. I don't think it is the ring per se, it is the fact that you, as the remaining remnant of their son, is leaving them. They looked at you to be surrogate grandparents to any children you have and now that you are moving away, that is lost. So they are lashing out at you. I wonder if they would be so adamant if you can find a way to make them honorary grandparents through Facetime and visits?", "NTA- but I think you should give the ring back since it's a family heirloom.  Maybe have a photographer take some beautiful pictures of the ring in placed that are meaningful to the relationship.  Or, even have a copy made by a jeweler.", "NTA. They had no issue with you having the ring until you found a new relationship. We\u2019re they expecting you to stay single forever out of love and respect for their son?\n\nThis is all grief talking. It\u2019s probably like they\u2019re losing the future they envisioned all over again now that you\u2019ve moved on. \n\nYou didn\u2019t stop being engaged, he passed. You were married, he was your husband and those items belong to you. If you feel generous give them a few items but that ring belongs to you. \n\nAlso calling your child their grandchild is taking a step too far. It\u2019s not their grandchild and consider how the father of that child may feel with your late husband\u2019s parents encroaching on this family you\u2019re making. Just something to talk about. \n\nIt\u2019s a sad affair all around.", "NAH. They are still grieving and that kind of pain doesn't go away. You gave a lot of items to them, and kept personal things that I suspect your husband would have wanted you to have.\n\nI would give back the ring. It's a family heirloom. Maybe take some photos of it, or have it recreated?\n\nETA: If you don't want to part with the ring, because it was an important symbol of your marriage, then you don't have to. If you think you can part with it, it would mean a lot to them. Also, they are in some ways grieving all over again... it sounds like they wanted to be a part of the baby's life. If they can respect your boundaries, then perhaps there is a place for them in your lives going forward. But again, that's all up to.", "ESH\n\nYou should probably keep a few things but it's unrealistic for you to keep everything. There is an argument to be made to return a family heirloom or let them buy it back. The ring thing is really the only questionable thing on your part. Finding a new partner after 7 years and moving isn't an AH thing.\n\nThe family is particularly rude for accusing you of moving on too quickly or not loving your husband. This seems really strange mixed with the grandchild idea. It doesn't sound like the kid is their son's kid. You probably shouldn't let the kid around these people if they're going to fly off the handle like this.", "You need to give the ring back. It\u2019s a family heirloom. They may want to leave it to their other relatives. It was given to you as they felt it would be passed down to your children with your husband.", "ESH.  I'm sure it hurts them that you are moving on and their son cannot, but your child is not their grandchild and they don't have the right to lay into you about leaving for France.  Having said that, please return the ring.  It should stay in their family if it is a family heirloom.  You are starting a new family now and it doesn't really include them.  I would think that if your late husband was here now, he'd want his folks to get that back, based on what you say here.", "ESH.  They are unreasonable in expecting you to be a widow forever and expecting to treat your child with another man as theirs.  But you should give that ring back.  It\u2019s the right thing to do.  They want to keep in the family.", "YTA, give them their family heir loom. It\u2019d be different if you had children with him, but you didn\u2019t. If you want to move on, you need to MOVE ON. Let them have their dead sons stuff. You have a new life to build\u2026 they don\u2019t. Their only son is dead and without grandchildren and you have a new life a country away\u2026 it\u2019s selfish.", "ESH\n\nWhat they said was horrible. \n\nHowever you keeping certain items seems wrong to me and weird concerning your new life.", "NTA. But please give them the ring back.", "NTA with the exception of the heirloom ring, you absolutely must give that back to them. It was given with the expectation that it would eventually pass to your children by your late husband and thus stay in the family.", "With OPs edits it sounds like you have given some things back and that\u2019s great. Ultimately I would give the ring back if they wanted it but understand the feelings behind it. NTA but I feel bad for the parents who are still grieving.", "YWBTA if you didn't give back the *family heirloom* ring. NTA for everything else.", "NTA. The ring is a family heirloom. It belongs to them, you should give it back.", "NTA. It\u2019s all yours do what you want with it. Only point would be what do you plan on doing with the ring? Will you wear it or will it live in a box to only be looked at on occasions? If it\u2019s the latter maybe you should pass it on. An engagement ring is meant to be worn, not kept in a box.", "ESH\n\n\nFirst the ring should be given back to them it is their family heir loom. What are your plans for the ring? Give it to your child? That baby has have no attachment to your late husband so why would you even give it to that child. Give it back to the family it should be with their family not yours. Keep everything except the ring.\n\nNo one is faulting you for moving on. Keep the notes the clothes the pictures. But the ring you need to give back. You can keep his memories with the other belongings , but this one item should stay with your late husbands family .

We knew each other from a very young age and married when we graduated college. I have known his family for almost my entire life and they are the closest I have to actual family (my own family situation has always been difficult ). I became very close with his parents in particular (I will still call my \"in laws\" in this post) and we supported each other heavily through the grief process. We didn't have children before he passed, but we were trying. I still miss my husband every day. \n\nI began slowly dating again 4 years ago - mostly casual dates and nothing serious. In laws were broadly supportive. I told them I was ready to date and they said OK, but didn't want to know the details. I only ever spoke about my dating life vaguely and infrequently to them. \n\nAround the same time, I got a big promotion and began to spend a couple months a year in Paris for work (pandemic permitting). Then 1 year ago, I met Armand (M38) and started my first serious relationship since being widowed. Given Armand lives in Paris, our relationship is based there and while we have travelled quite a lot together, we haven't been to the US together yet. He hasn't met my in laws, but I have told them I am dating someone. \n\nAround Christmas, we found out I was pregnant. This was a total surprise as we weren't trying. We have since decided that I will move to France permanently instead of splitting my time between the US and France, so that we can raise a family together. It isn't really possible for Armand to move to the US - he works in the art industry and his studio and backers are all Europe based. \n\nI told my in laws and they were deeply upset. They said I was depriving them of their only opportunity to have a grandchild (my husband was an only child). They then accused me of moving on too quickly and not loving my husband. In the end, we had a huge argument and they have demanded that I leave all my husband's belongings from our apartment (his clothes, personal effects, etc) to them when I move to Paris. They also demanded my engagement ring, which is a family heirloom. They said they should have these because while I have moved on, he will never stop being their son. \n\nI said no, these things are all treasured memories from my life with him that I never want to forget. They have threatened legal action to recover the ring in particular. I'm not sure they have a proper legal right. But I can see the hurt I'm causing them with my choices and maybe giving them what they ask for, they will be able to have closure. AITA for continuing to refuse?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Tell them you are not ready to give ring back.

Because they will come and take it when you are out.", "NAH  \n\n\nYour inlaws are in deep grief over the loss of their son. They are being unreasonable in their anger towards you, but greif in general gives no rhyme or reason to where it falls. They feel they are losing you, and the reaction is trifold, as they believe your move to paris will sever the ties. They are blinded by their own pain, a wound reopened. Honestly, I can't blame anyone in that state, but I can say you are not at fault for any of it.   \n\n\nThis was your husband, you did not divorce, he died and you remained his widowed wife. You did not divorce them as your in-laws, you all remained bound by the loss of your ex-husband. That ring is yours as you are at the time of his death, his wife. I would not budge on the ring, not unless you yourself feel its time to let it go. It's not your fault he died anymore than it's theirs.   \n\n\nYou can tell them that no, you won't be removing all the memories of their son from your history and life. You can tell them you understand they may be angry with you about that, but with time you hope they remember that you are their daughter-in-law. You loved them and were not depriving them of their relationship with you, only switching locations on the globe.", "NTA. You gave them back anything they wanted after the funeral.

They didn't care about those things until you told them you were moving. They don't care about them because they belonged to your late husband or that they are family heirlooms. They care about them because it gives them control over you.", "I'm going to go ahead and say NTA. But at the same time, I think they need some therapy. Losing a child is something that is incredibly difficult (i have no first hand knowledge but I've seen how it tears people apart, especially mothers) and I don't think they've moved on. To them, it may feel like only a short time has passed, time probably feels like it has stood still since their son passed away. I hope you can find some kind of compromise with them. Good luck!", "NTA - Yet, I would relent on the ring by giving it back to the family.  If you wore the ring for 20 years their might be more of question, but he passed early in your whole relationship. I would return this family heirloom because it is the right thing to do. I think even if you felt their son would have wanted you to have it - I would still return it.  By simple rights you would still legally own it for sure, but we are not talking about the law.  Heirlooms have their ow story outside your relationship;  that story has not become yours, so it should no pass out of a family. Again I feel the biggest factor is time - JMO.", "NTA. The prospect of losing you opened an old wound for your in-laws, so their hurt is understandable, but by invalidating your feelings for your late husband and making it all about themselves they're acting like heartless assholes.\n\nThe only time I'd consider giving the ring back is if your in-laws intend to give the ring to a niece/nephew to keep it in the family. If not, you're the closest person they have to pass the family heirloom to, and I see no reason why you should let them take it to their graves instead.", "Honey, it sounds like their grief has hit them deeply with this news.\n\nKeep your things, they belong to you. Another commenter suggested putting the ring in your will so it goes back to his family, so you can enjoy it during your life and then it stays in his family as an heirloom.\n\nGive them some time, it sounds like you value them like family, moving away doesn't mean that has to end. They can still play an active role in your child's life, what child wouldn't benefit from extra, loving grandparents?\n\nWrite down how you feel, maybe even show them this post.

I know plenty of other people disagree with me, but I don\u2019t think you HAVE to give the ring back. It would be a kind thing to do if you decide to, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re obligated to.\n\nWhen you give something to anyone (and I don\u2019t mean lend, I mean give), you do so with the understanding that they can do what they want with it because it belongs to them now. I believe this applies to engagement rings that have been passed down, unless there was a specific agreement or documentation stating otherwise (which we don\u2019t know anything about), though I understand many may disagree with me. \n\nYour parents (to my knowledge; it could have been passed down by a grandparent, I suppose) gave your husband that ring, and he chose to give it you when he proposed.

It took you YEARS to even casually date again. You haven\u2019t forgotten your husband. You haven\u2019t forsaken him. You LOVE your husband.

It's yours. It was a gift from your husband. It ceased being the family property when it was given to your husband. It became his property, and he gave it to you. Then it became yours. It's not like you left him at the altar betraying the promise of the ring... he passed on. A widow owns her engagement and wedding rings. Full stop.\n\nI *was* struggling with the no AHs thing because well... I think I can see where they're coming from... or... why they're coming from where they are...\n\nThe ring is an heirloom, and no, it probably won't be passed down in their family anymore even if you return it. But I can imagine, as a parent, if my child had died, that the thought of that ring sitting in a drawer somewhere gathering dust... that would break my heart. I can imagine that the inlaws might believe that's what is bound to happen *at best* with you marrying someone else. A majority of people would likely be uncomfortable with their new spouse wearing a former spouse's engagement ring. Many might feel uncomfortable with their spouse even keeping that ring. They might be worried that your new husband will convince you to sell it, or give it away, and then ... well, it's still a reminder of your first husband for you, so it is for them as well. \n\nSpeaking of reminders... you're likely their last *significant* connection to the child they've lost. You're dating, marrying, obviously ready to move on, but they *aren't*. They're losing him all over again, losing this last connection to him.\n\nEven with you remarrying/having a child... I can see the logic. Imagine if he'd lived and you got divorced and had a child... it would... kinda sorta... not quite be his... stepchild? \n\nObviously it wouldn't.

Half the DNA their grandchild would have held. \n\nGrief is *weird*. It doesn't have a time limit, it isn't logical, it doesn't hit any 2 people the same even in the exact same circumstances. You know grief is kindof an AH. You've lived it. You're probably still living it even though you're able to move forward now. I wouldn't judge them too harshly for grieving...\n\nHmm...\n\nI would assert a boundary here. Let them know you're willing to talk/share/compromise in whatever way you're willing to do so, but *without* the threats. If they threaten you, you're done talking. It's your property.

I don't think there's any AH here, all I'm seeing is hurt people in an AH of a situation.\n\nThe ring is the part I'm most on the fence about. I can see your sentimental attachment to it, but I can also assume that the intent in your husband giving it to you was for it to continue as an heirloom.\n\nI can see their POV that it's a family heirloom and they feel like you're leaving the family (and hence the heirloom is leaving the family).  I'm not saying they're right, I'm saying I see how they may feel that way.\n\nOn the other hand, if their son was an only child, it's not clear where else it should go.  If there's someone else it should go to, that might be the proper path for an heirloom.  If they don't have someone else for it to go to, then taking it back just so that it's not yours anymore isn't solving anything.\n\nThis is going to sound more like relationship advice than AITA.  But personally I'd recommend you continue to look for ways to compromise - but not to the point of being a doormat, they need to compromise with you too.\n\nBut I think it's important to realise there's no assholes here.  I think the in-laws are hurting because they're losing one more connection to their son - and it's not the ring, it's you. You're that connection to their son that they feel like they're losing.\n\nYou're completely right to carry on with your life at your own pace.

Someday, hopefully soon, your in laws will come to see that too.", "If you could make sure someone in his family eventually gets the ring; like in your will or whatever, that would probably be good.", "Well i hate to say it but now you are no longer apart of their family. You were before but now they probably wont see you again so yeah they might want it back.", "It\u2019s a rather sad situation.  They feel you are their daughter and your baby is their \u201cgrandchild\u201d.   However that is not the case.  \n\nNTA.  They are reacting out of emotion instead of logic.  \n\nThey are still grieving.  It\u2019s something they have to work through without  your personal belongings or your ring.", "I think the fact that they didn't ask for it back right away after he died means they gave up any right to it legally. It's been 7 years, they don't have any standing at this point. And the fact that you've kept in contact with them and they've never said anything before?", "they\u2019re asking for it back because you\u2019re leaving the country. at least if you had gotten together with a guy in the US, the ring has a slight chance of staying in the family since everyone would still be maintaining their relationship with you. You leaving the country with the ring = the ring leaving the family.", "Cousin proposes to his partner \n\n\"See here dear, this ring is very special, I had a cousin who proposed to his wife with this ring and they had a beautiful marriage that was cut short when he died. His parents threatened legal action if his widow didn't give back the ring so she did and they gave it to me so I could give it to you\"", "It's hers, so, tough shit for hypothetical cousin? It's HER engagement ring, a token of her late husband's eternal love for her, and their lives together. It's not just some shiny bauble that anyone who feels like they like it get to claim as their own.\n\nIf the parents didn't want a \"family heirloom\" to be given, PERMANENTLY, to someone not in their genetic bloodline, then they shouldn't have given it to her late husband to use as an engagement ring.", "It should be HER choice as to if/when the ring goes to someone else. It would be nice if the ring eventually returned to his family, but, right now, it is HER Engagement Ring.", "Add to it the fact that an engagement ring isn't just a \"gift,\" either.\n\nExtra-extra-cheap and tawdry.", "It's \\*morally\\* OP's, too, unless you're okay with being grasping and tawdry in thieving back a GIFT.", "Clearly since she has made the decision to move out of the country to join her life with the man she created a child with rather than staying home with her former in laws as the infant\u2019s closest family.", "I understand the aspect of wanting to cherish something her husband had given her. It was under the impression that it would be passed down to future kids and grandchildren. An unfortunate thing happened, and he had passed before they had children. That hurt she felt will be a part of her forever. \n\nOur morals are different here though and that is okay. Yes, it went to her but under the circumstances my morals couldn't keep it out from the family it's meant to be in. The beautiful memories and feelings are what matter.", "She moves on with a new family and personally I also find it the only morally right thing to do. Idc if you agree.", "No it doesn't make it less meaningful.\n\nHowever they are what bonds most people together, in my opinion.", "That's fair. Divorce law is a state issue as it is, so you're probably correct. I'm not a lawyer, after all, just someone who has divorced twice and knows a few folks in similar situations. So I guess in my state it's a gift which you can't get back, but perhaps not the case in others.", "This should be right on top! I think you've summed it up perfectly. In-laws are scared they'll lose OP too, their last physical connection to their son. Their grief isn't letting them think straight and they're lashing out. What they need is love, and reassurance that OP still wants to stay connected to them (I hope OP does because they say their in-laws are their closest family). NAH.", "Just because someone remarried doesn't mean the previous marriage is completely forgotten. Grief never ends, it is lifelong. All that happens is that you learn to live with it", "It wants it back to punish you for having someone else's child and leaving the country.\n\nDon't give them rings or anything else", "I'm on board with this.  It has been many years.  My husband's brother passed away one year, he drowned saving his wife horrible horrible tragedy, his wife had a whole other baby with another man within a year of his death.  That is moving on too quick.  \n\nDo not let them guilt trip you into anything you do not want to do.", "This is a very kind, generous plan.", "If that\u2019s how you choose to define asking for a family heirloom back then more power to you. I\u2019m just saying I can understand why someone would want it back in the family since there is no longer family for her to pass it to. I\u2019m not the only person in the long list of replies to understand where someone is coming from with the ask either. I\u2019m not saying anything about any other possessions. Just the family heirloom here.", "OP didn\u2019t \u201ctake it out of the family\u201d, it was given to her, and it is probably the biggest symbol of her love for her late husband.", "Children of divorced parents would disagree.", "That is incredibly offensive to people who don\u2019t want children, which is me.", "Yep. I lost my fiance many years ago.\n\nIt may get easier, but the hole it leaves never really goes away.", "You're conflating two different things.\n\nThose two sets of families are still bonded over those kids.", "Offensive doesn't mean any less true.", "Many people remain close and consider each other family even after a spouse dies.", "You\u2019re saying that children bond people together. You\u2019ve said in this thread that if OP had children with this man only then would her grief and lasting love for her late husband make sense to you. People who divorce after having children completely disproves the point you\u2019re trying to make. Those people share a bond with their children, not with each other, because in many cases these people would never speak to each other again if it wasn\u2019t for the kids.", "Yes, that's happened here, until she started to move on and then it all changed.", "I don't know what you're talking about.\n\nI brought up that if she would have had children with him, it would make more sense to keep those things to pass on and they would have things from their father. \n\nYou've created your own point and arguing it when it has nothing to do with what I said.", "It doesn\u2019t HAVE to all change. Plenty of people get remarried and move and still maintain their relationship with their deceased spouse\u2019s parents. You can still visit/text/Facetime/call/email/write letters.", "You mentioned nothing about passing items down to the kids except for the ring until this comment. You only stated that it would make sense to want to keep these memories if there were kids. Therefore you have implied multiple times in this thread that the only reason she would have to keep those items is if she had kids to pass them onto. As if she had to have kids with him to love him that much. Then you said that children bond people together. I have explained how that is just not true."]}
