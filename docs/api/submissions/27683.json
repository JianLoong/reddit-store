I\u2019ve been nothing but good to him in many ways. Helping him out by listening to his problems, showing interest in his activities, tried teaching him right or wrong in the best of ways. He\u2019s the youngest sibling and very spoiled, even unmannered. No one in the family seems to care about these behaviors, but I saw him like my own brother trying to be a role model and teach him about principals etc.\n\nI\u2019m a short guy and unfortunate enough to have lost my hair going bald these last couple of years.\n\nHe\u2019s always made fun of these features of mine in different ways and words, some being pretty brutal. Not only when just us two are in the room but even out in the public or in front of other family members and friends. \n\nI bare in mind that he\u2019s young and maybe doesn\u2019t know any better, I even took it as a joke in the beginning with no hard feelings. Plus the fact that he happens to be my wife\u2019s brother extended my tolerance for him even more. Naturally he\u2019s very dear to her.\n\nThe jokes kept going and going for a looong period, every encounter he\u2019s ridiculed me and made me feel belittled in front of whoever. (Forgot to mention that I\u2019ve tried telling him several times in a nice way pretty early on, maybe a month after he started doing this.) but it never stopped.\n\nThis has gradually made me avoid him and not liking to spend time around him if I have the choice since talking to him won\u2019t make a difference in his behavior.\n\nSo yesterday my wife brought up his name and mentioned that she feels I\u2019ve been trying to avoid her brother etc.\n\nAnd I came clean about it as it apparently weren\u2019t obvious, that I\u2019m not his biggest fan unfortunately. By any means I\u2019ve never been bad to him or treated him differently, I only choose not to hang out with him or talk to him if the alternative is open. Since he always gives me this negative feeling, all unprovoked and no one in his family ever reacts to his actions which also disappoints me.\n\nShe instantly tried to defend him by calling him little and almost described him as a baby. And told me she feels hurt because I don\u2019t like her brother.\nI\u2019ve tried explaining everything from my perspective and how it makes me feel but she only counters it all with vague arguments. The talk ended in us two not being on the same page and her giving me the silence treatment the whole night and even this day till now.\n\nSo please give me your honesty, AITA?\nAm I childish for not having the best feelings towards someone not treating me with respect despite the age gap and even trying to resolve things by communicating before acting this way?", "created_utc": 1695743800, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16srssg/aita_for_avoiding_my_wifes_younger_brother/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Basically, they consent to this behavior despite your feelings.\n\nI would be upfront about this OP with your wife. I foresee your parenting styles, if you choose to have children, differing when it comes to raising them and disciplining them. \n\nYour wife is prioritizing her brother over you.", "NTA. Come on! Your wife's giving you the silent treatment and you're worried that *you're* the one acting childish?\n\nYou have a spouse problem. She's immature, seems to think her brother can do no wrong, and is fine with him constantly insulting you.", "NTA you have given him many chance and are not mean to him you are distancing yourself from him not being mean back to him. Only thing i would say that you couldve done is talk to him directly one on one. but besides that nothing you can do", "NTA\n\nHe sounds like a nightmare and your wife defending his behaviour is just as bad!", "NTA  A 16 year old is not a baby and he knows full well that he is insulting you.  Unfortunately it seems his family has enabled him to have bullyish behavior.  You have the right to be around people that treat you with respect.  Let your wife know that until he can be respectful you choose to not be around him.  In fact, it would be a good idea for you to tell him this straight up.  Tell him to feel free to talk to you when he can do so in a respectful, nonbelittling manner.  Whenever he says something insulting, no matter where you are, repeat the same thing for everyone to hear.  Standing up for yourself is a good thing, and hopefully your wife will see how destructive his behavior is.  One day he is going to mouth off to the wrong people and he will pay a big price for that.  Good luck.  You are doing nothing wrong but his family is.", "Nta\n\n Personally, I would tell your wife this. \n\nThe fact you defend a 16 year old family or not, that is being mean, cruel, and a bully. The fact you are not listening to hiw his remarks hurt. That he is doing this in front of others. Has been asked to stop and refuses. The fact you seem to care about enabling him to be a bully and not enough about what his actions cause. The fact that at 16 he damn well knows what he is doing wrong but no one calls him on it or corrects its. The fact you put my feelings to the side. Not listening or understanding. It has made me think  any children we may have will be allowed to act that way. Will be supported in that. And it makes me look at you differently because of it. At this point I do not see us having children together with the way you are acting right now. Giving me the silent treatment because you don't like what I said. Using that as a form of punishment when you won't even acknowledge what I am feeling. \n\n\n\nDude I am sorry but I would NOT have kids with her. They let him be a bully. Back and defend him. Either your kids will be bullies or be bullied by him or be taught as he bullies you that they are expected to accept that behavior l. Are you willing to put any kids you have through that. Are you willing to not tell spouse you either go to counseling together or you need to rethink the relationship. I am sorry but her backing a 16 year old like that. Willing to double down. Give the silent treatment when you do not accept it. Are you willing to stay with someone who will not listen to you. Understand the pain and what he is causing you? That is NOT love, and she will expect you to apologize to her. To suck it up and allow her brother to abuse you while you become a doormat because it's family.", "NTA \nYour BIL is rude to you and unpleasant to br around but your wife wants to be hurt that you don\u2019t want to be around him? \n\nHer brother is obviously TA for his behavior and your wife is also TA not only for tolerating her brother\u2019s behavior but also for the way she\u2019s handling this. Silent treatment is a horrible way to have a disagreement. Why is she ok with her brother making fun of you and why aren\u2019t your feelings relevant?", "NTA. And start shutting down that kind of treatment of you. Wife needs to get over her \"little\" brother-baby. I would have been able to tolerate that as long as you have been. And wife giving you the silent treatment? Tell her if she wants a husband, she has to act like a wife or else she can go live with her brother.  \n16 is way too old for that. Actually, NO child would have the right to belittle and mock you that way. Stop being a doormat for little bro or wife to wipe their feet on.", "NTA. If you two are planning on ever having kids, near future or distance, ask her if she would be okay with her brother talking to/about her kids the same way he does to you.", "NTA - This boy needs to learn how to behave or he will end up disliked and probably get his a$$ kicked for treating people this way.  She needs to put her brother in his place, but you should also do some big-brothering him and tell him that it makes him look like a loser to always be putting someone else down.  Strong people build others up.", "NTA. Your wife is. Two reasons, one is that she is too young to be married. Second, she is putting her younger \"bro\" ahead of you.  \n\n\nFirst rule of getting married: \"Forsake all others\". What that means is your partner moves to the #1 spot, and stays there. Wifeypoo has moved you out of #1, and has installed her brother there. You are not #1 with your wife. You never will be. I have been through this.", "NTA, I married a short, bald guy. Short guys are awesome in bed!", "Sorry man I wish your wife would back you up \u2014- sounds like you responded like a really cool guy for quite a while, and now you\u2019re totally within your rights to not want to hang out with that little shit. \n\nI hope you show your wife this\u2026 she should be backing you up more she\u2019s let you down id say.

It is bad enough that your BIL is a spoiled bully, but your wife is defending him.  And her reaction is very immature.  There may be a family dynamic that creates individuals like this.  If she cannot see what is going on, your marriage is in for some very rough waters ahead.\n\nNTA", "YTA because you are short and bald. That\u2019s a fact. Why do a child\u2019s jokes bother you so much?", "YTA. It's clear you're the one in the wrong here. The wife's younger brother is just a teenager, and you, as the adult and the one who's supposed to be a role model, should have handled the situation with more maturity and understanding. Making fun of someone's appearance is not okay, but neither is avoiding someone and holding a grudge instead of addressing the issue constructively", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

While it\u2019s true kids a certain age have no social filters, 16 is waaay far from that age group and it\u2019s now in the plain teenage AH behavior, which is totally still in the norm, but should be rectified by his sister (your wife) in primis. Without excuses.", "NTA\n\n- While your brother in law is a teenager he isn\u2019t a small child by any means, he should know better; you\u2019re more than 10 years older than him and deserve respect, I want to think he doesn\u2019t talk to his teachers like that.\n- Yes, you\u2019re an adult and he\u2019s not, but the thing is that you really can only be a true role model (IMO) to your own children since you can correct them appropriately, but in this case, if you try to call him out you\u2019re going to end up in a bad situation with your wife and your parents in law, considering they don\u2019t see the wrong in him, nor they try to correct him.\n- You already tried to explain to him that you\u2019re not ok with him treating you like that and he has continued doing it, the most diplomatic way of dealing with it is what you\u2019re doing: avoiding him so that the problem doesn\u2019t escalate. You are already annoyed with him, and if you force yourself to be near him you will eventually explode, and that would be much worse and very difficult to defend.\n\nDefinitely not the AH, you are just being prudent and avoiding trouble, maybe he\u2019ll grow out of it and you can rekindle your relationship in the future, but not now.", "You tried to be his friend and still, despite you asking him to tone it down, he carried on being rude and disrespectful. Your wife had a chance to tell him, as big sister, to wind his neck in; she didn't so you are going with Plan B. If you tell him to mind his fucking manners you will be the villain of the story, so keeping out of the obnoxious twerp's way is the obvious solution.\n\nIf your wife is unhappy, then she can explain to him how the world works. People who have the option choose to avoid jerks. She's family, so she has to love him. You are an in-law so you only have to tolerate him when it's unavoidable.

NTA", "NTA At 16 he is old enough to have filters and manners. The babying attitude of his family that makes him get away with all this. We all have shortcomings that we are very well aware of but those don't define us. Nobody should be bullied by a spoiled 16 year old. By the way I'm around kids this age constantly and this is NOT typical or normal, they know it much better than that.", "NTA.\n\nYou would have been TA if you had mocked him back, yelled at him, etc. But instead, you took the mature route of trying to correct the behaviour, and when that failed, took interaction out of the equation. Sixteen isn't a baby, and he should know better than to mock someone. He needs to grow tf up.", "NTA.\n\nSixteen\ud83d\udc4fis\ud83d\udc4fnot\ud83d\udc4fa\ud83d\udc4fchild!\n\nHe is literally 2 (or 4 maybe, not sure of your country) years away from being a legal adult.

Instead of blowing up or turning it into this huge deal, you did the smart thing and removed yourself from the situation.\n\nBeing her \"baby brother\" doesn't mean he is a baby.

First off, if anyone is rude to you or makes you feel like shit you have the right to avoid them. Second off, her infantilizing him is enabling HIS childish behavior. He\u2019s 16, not 5. Third, you\u2019re not being an asshole back to him, you\u2019ve been nothing but kind and you havent scolded him once for his behavior. You\u2019re just trying to protect yourself. Your wife needs to understand that she has an obligation to both of you, her brother AND her husband. If she struggles then thats something she needs to work on. But even then, she isnt supposed to be parenting her brother. Her parents are meant to do that.", "NTA - he\u2019s 16 and not 12. Sadly, this is a symptom of a the bigger issue that they have spoiled him and have allowed him to not have manners.\n\nHe\u2019s old enough to be treated like an adult. If he makes a comments, just say, \u201cthat\u2019s rude, and you need to apologize. You\u2019re old enough to not be treated like a child anymore and what you say bothers me\u201d.

Not at weddings, funerals, whatever. A rift in the family? Then the family can know just how irritating BIL has been.\n\nAnd your wife is lying when she says he's a baby. Sixteen is not a baby. He knows exactly what he's doing.", "NTA. Ask the 16 year old if he thinks he's a baby. I can guarantee you he doesn't. No you're not being childish.", "NTA you have asked him to stop humiliating you and he refuses to be a decent human being. He chooses to be a jerk instead. You have tried being nice, for years, and nothing has worked to gain this kid's respect. Of course you don't want to be around him.", "He did address it the little AH refuses to listen to how it makes him feel. There's nothing wrong with OP avoiding him after he took every opportunity possible to try to correct the little AH behavior. His wife should stop her dramatics before she becomes an ex wife lol"]}
