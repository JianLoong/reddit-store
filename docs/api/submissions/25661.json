As a birthday gift my brother and his partner wanted to fly the girls to Alpine, WY, for hiking and to play in the river. They own their own small plane, my brother\u2019s husband was a marine pilot and flying is now his hobby. The trip is a little less than an hour by plane, so this would be a day trip for them.\n\nThe problem is I just don\u2019t trust this plane... it\u2019s so small, only 5 people fit in it and that includes the pilot. That means either myself or my husband could go and my husband has been trying to persuade me since he LOVES planes and he\u2019s telling me how safe it is. I think he just wants to go as a treat to himself, and he told me I just don\u2019t want to let them go because I\u2019m controlling. We got into an argument over it and he\u2019s very upset that I won\u2019t even consider it. Does that make me an asshole, to be worried about this?\n\nEdit to add the girls have no idea this was offered. My brother and BIL brought the idea up with me and my husband, and I immediately told them *absolutely* not. I honestly do not care how much training he has, there's not enough training where I'd trust to let my girls get off the ground in that plane. Besides, the girls have asked to go up before and I've always said no, so I don't know why my BIL would think now would be different? At least though they didn't go behind my back and promise this to the girls first.", "created_utc": 1693169626, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1631qi5/aita_for_not_letting_my_11_and_13_yo_daughters/", "score": 4020, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're not TA to be worried, but to deny them the trip based on your fear is your problem, not the girls.\n\n\"There's not enough training where I'd trust to let my girls get off the ground in that plane\"... does that mean you're the type to immediately refuse to let them board a commercial airliner if you don't like the look of the plane, or the pilot?

I\u2019m a flight instructor, meaning I teach people how to fly small general aviation aircraft every day. First, your BIL\u2019s airplane is inspected at least once a year by a professional airframe and powerplant (A&P) mechanic. That person is certified by the FAA and knows what they\u2019re doing. They wouldn\u2019t sign off on your BIL\u2019s airplane being safe to fly if anything was wrong with it. Second, your BIL is a military trained pilot. He knows what he\u2019s doing.

It\u2019s valid to have concerns and some level of fear since these are your kids. However, what happens when they get older? Will the answer always be no? There may come a time when the girls come to resent you for holding back on the experience. Maybe come up with some sort of compromise to get you more comfortable with the idea? Perhaps taking a shorter trip with you (and maybe the girls) first so you can get insights in to what a flight really is like and you can trust more.\n\nEdited for clarity", "YTA.

I\u2019ve never met a former military pilot that could not afford maintenance or inspection, they\u2019re usually on top of that stuff.\n\nAccidents in small planes are almost always attributed to weather conditions, and getting a weather briefing solves that issue.

Private aviation is a different ballgame, and even with your BIL\u2019s experience, it\u2019s ok to be overcautious.

Don\u2019t listen to these ppl. Flying commercial is what\u2019s safe. Just ask buddy Holly, patsy cline, randy Rhodes, Kobe Bryant, and all these other folks who flew private.

Small aircraft have to pass regular inspections, and the pilot has to perform a basic inspection EVERY time they fly. Do you inspect your car every time your drive? Your girls will be in FAR more danger on the ride to the airport than they will be in the air. Do you understand why even small aircraft crashes make the national news? It's because they're RARE. Even FATAL car wrecks rarely make even local news, aside from traffic reports. Let your girls have an experience. You're going to end up raising women that are afraid to take even small risks.

I was in a crash in a small plane when I was about your kids\u2019 age. You\u2019re being irrational and over the top here. The size of the aircraft has nothing to do with its safety; most crashes are due to pilot error. You say you have no doubts about BIL as a pilot, so your reasoning is 100% fear, 0% data. It\u2019s about you and how you feel, which is a terrible reason to limit your children\u2019s lives.\n\nWe can\u2019t let fear rule us.

I also suspect he maintains that plane pretty damn well.", "First, the fact that there is not room for both you and your husband to go is completely immaterial.  Your husband wants to go so he goes and you stay home.  Your presence on the airplane won't help and would arguably make it slightly less safe because no one needs a passenger having a panic attack while they are flying a plane.\n\nSecond, if he has flown with the military, he's the type of pilot that airlines would be fighting over to get in the cockpit of their planes.  Military pilots don't have to shell out money to practice while they are training and they train a lot.  So he is going to have more experience behind the stick that than almost any of the younger airline pilots.  \n\nThird, you cannot eliminate all risk from your family's life.  Most people have a poor sense of relative risk.  This is one of those circumstances.  If he were a rich newbie in the cockpit I'd say no but he's likely safer than the commercial airlines with his experience.

This is an incredible opportunity for your kids to experience something most people don\u2019t experience in their entire life.\n\nIt is scary, but this is somewhere I would encourage you to push your boundaries a bit and let go", "You aren\u2019t the Asshole. As the mother, you have the right to make decisions about your children\u2019s safety, and anyone who thinks your an asshole for not putting them in a situation you deem dangerous is overstepping(in your life, here they aren\u2019t, cause you asked, but still I disagree.).", "NAH. \n\nAll these people comparing it to being safer driving a car are completely wrong. That's true for commercial flights, but not small private aircrafts. They're estimated to be 20x more dangerous than driving and account for roughly 94% of all fatal accidents. They are pretty not safe. I'm uncomfortable with the number of times a deadly small plane crash has touched people in my life, or myself personally. Last time I went to Alaska, a small plane carrying people from my cruise crashed and they all died. It was pretty terrible. I only ever knew my neighbor as a widow because her husband died in a small plane accident right before I was born. I have a lot of other stories like that. Your fears are not unfounded. \n\nIf I were to EVER get on a plane like that, it would have to be with a pilot like your BIL. If it was someone I knew, was familiar with his flight history and track record, I might maybe work up to a small trip. It might also help to talk through the safety process and logistics with the pilot. Maybe see if you can have a frank convo with BIL and build up your level of comfort. But if it doesn't happen, I don't blame you. \n\nThis is hardly a once on a lifetime opportunity. BIL will still be their uncle when they're older. If he's still flying, he can take them when they're 18. There are plenty of other small plane trip opportunities out there with other pilots, too. If they choose to go as adults, they can.", "The size of the plane is generally irrelevant to safety, unless there's REALLY bad weather. It's the maintenance of the plane and the pilot. If you don't trust your BIL to make sure the plane is maintained properly, that's one thing.

She can make her own decisions on flying with your BIL then, as is her right, and her sister after her. Until then, a parents job is to keep their kids safe. A big part of that is trusting your instincts and, occasionally, accepting that the \u201csafe\u201d route isn\u2019t always the \u201cfun route.\n\nTo the people putting forth straw man arguments about letting your kids into cars - cars are something of a necessity nowadays. Even if you live in a city, at a certain point your kid will ride an Uber, be in a carpool, and etc. They WILL be exposed to cars and the risk of car accidents - you can\u2019t change that.

That plane is safer than your car.", "I guarantee the former marine who's after duty hoby is flying is going to maintain his ane better than most airlines.  Small old airplanes are very reliable, hell when I was training I was flying small piper warriors built in the 60s and the reason they were used for training is they are rock solid and safe if you maintain them right.  \n\n\nFlying in a small plane is actually pretty safe if the pilot knows what they're doing (again former marine pilot... So yeah) and if the plane is properly maintained (again gear maintenance is literally drilled into marines brains... And this is the hobby he enjoys so yeah probably good there). And even if God forbid something did go wrong like the engine died (the most probable issue to run into) planes don't just fall out of the sky, half of flight training is your instructor pull the throttle back to idle and saying \"uh oh you don't have an engine... Now what?\" \n\n\nEstablish the optimum glide slope and visually look for a suitable landing area then communicate the emergency and land the plane.  Planes land on grass/dirt paths all the time, look up bush planes, so landing off runway isn't necessarily dangerous unless no proper landing zone can be identified.  Once again though this happening is very unlikely in the first place, planes need to be inspected by the fas annually to ensure they are flight worthy and need theri engines rebuilt after so many hours of usage.  This is done proactively to ensure planes are a safe as possible.  To worry is to parent, but to deny your children this honestly amazing experience because of worries about one of the lost regulated and safe forms of transportation around... That would be an asshole move imo.\n\n\nIf there was bad weather that day then I'd say yeah tell them to postpone the trip, since it's their plane you absolutely can wait until a good day to fly.\n\n\nThis all being said, I'm making assumptions based on marine buddies I know, if this particular pilot leads you to believe he would neglect his plane or his flying skills are questionable, then absolutely you have the right to deny the trip....

Because no one who loves themselves that much will allow themselves to die, especially when they\u2019re in control.

I don\u2019t agree with you making such an overarching decision based on layman\u2019s knowledge, however the general public has no idea what it takes to become a pilot.

And it\u2019s not just a one time review of maneuvers; they practice with an instructor until it becomes second nature.

Pediatrician here. I mention that because it\u2019s part of my job to counsel/advise parents about risks and dangers their kids might encounter. Because that\u2019s a parent\u2019s responsibility: to assess the risk/benefit ratio of any activity for their children who are not yet capable of making such complex decisions. Some things balance out in favor of doing it despite the risk - for example, riding in a car or taking a commercial flight across the country. The risk is still there, but the benefit - the ability to go literally anywhere in the United States, or the ability to travel to places far away rapidly - is high enough to justify. \n\nThe ratio for other activities may come out differently and will vary for each person based on their own experiences. As a child, I was forbidden to get on any ATV, because a little girl at my sister\u2019s elementary school had died on one. I suffered no poor outcomes from this. I absolutely had a full and wonderful childhood. Did they look fun when some of my friends used them? Sure. But now, looking back with the knowledge of the number of pediatric spinal injuries and deaths that occur as a result of these vehicles, I\u2019m so thankful my mom never let me on one, because I absolutely do not possess the motor skills to safely operate one. There is zero chance I would not have been injured.\n\nMy mom did not think the fun I might\u2019ve had on an ATV was worth the potential injury. She did, however, let me ride a horse, bought me and my sister a trampoline in the 90s with no netting around it (I once bounced off of it back-first onto a bike on the ground. I\u2019m probably lucky to have been only bruised!), and she put me in swimming lessons at 2 because she didn\u2019t know how to swim and wanted to be sure I could save myself. She only kept me from a few specific activities where she deemed the benefits too low for the risks. She did what a parent should: assessed the ratio and decided which things would be enough fun or socially necessary enough to justify the risks. \n\nIn my opinion, the risk/benefit ratio here is not in favor of flying. Most likely, nothing would happen, and I\u2019m sure they would have lots of fun. But this type of flying is in no way necessary or a common childhood experience; they\u2019re not missing out on some essential childhood rite of passage. They will be just fine without it. The husband is of course free to try it, and the girls can try when they\u2019re old enough to make their own decisions, just as I\u2019ve made my own decisions now about ATVs. (It\u2019s still a no.

I'm not a pilot, so I've surely missed some important points, but here's are some of the big ones:\n\n1. Airliners always have at least two pilots on board, and with the exception of occasional bathroom breaks always have two pilots in the cockpit, each with a well defined set of responsibilities. This reduces the mental workload, makes it less likely that important things will be missed, and adds capacity to deal with something going wrong. Private planes often (but not always) operate with just one pilot, and even when there are two, they may not be so disciplined about their roles and cross-checks.\n\n2. Airline pilots undergo regular training, including training in flight simulators most private pilots can't afford to use. They are evaluated by experts on both their performance in simulated problem scenarios and their performance in regular real world operations. Private pilots have no such requirements.\n\n3. Airliners have highly redundant, often technologically sophisticated safety systems all over the place. They have at least two but usually three completely different systems for keeping track of exactly where they are in the world, and E-GPWS systems that use location information to warn pilots if they're approaching terrain. They have full TCAS systems to warn them if they risk conflict with other aircraft, and tell them how to resolve it. They have sufficiently powerful engines to take off, climb, fly, and land safely even when one engine has failed (or two have on a four-engine plane). They have weather radars to help see and avoid thunderstorms. They have auto-land systems capable of zero-visibility landings. Some private planes have some similar safety features; I don't think any have all. Furthermore, there are a lot more regulatory eyes on the design and manufacture of airliners than small planes.\n\n4. Airlines have to follow very strict regulations regarding maintenance schedules and repair of their planes. This is super important, because many crashes are caused by inadequate or improper maintenance. Airlines also have a lot of really fancy equipment to perform extremely detailed inspections of aircraft for microscopic signs of wear.\n\n5. Small planes inherently face greater danger from strong turbulence. This can be turbulence from a nearby thunderstorm, from certain effects of mountains, or from the wakes of large planes that have recently gone by (wake turbulence). Turbulence that might give airline passengers a bumpy ride can literally flip a small plane right over.", "The BOAT PEOPLE are better pilots?", "You let your daughter in a house!?
