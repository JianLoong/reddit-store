As a birthday gift my brother and his partner wanted to fly the girls to Alpine, WY, for hiking and to play in the river. They own their own small plane, my brother\u2019s husband was a marine pilot and flying is now his hobby. The trip is a little less than an hour by plane, so this would be a day trip for them.\n\nThe problem is I just don\u2019t trust this plane... it\u2019s so small, only 5 people fit in it and that includes the pilot. That means either myself or my husband could go and my husband has been trying to persuade me since he LOVES planes and he\u2019s telling me how safe it is. I think he just wants to go as a treat to himself, and he told me I just don\u2019t want to let them go because I\u2019m controlling. We got into an argument over it and he\u2019s very upset that I won\u2019t even consider it. Does that make me an asshole, to be worried about this?\n\nEdit to add the girls have no idea this was offered. My brother and BIL brought the idea up with me and my husband and I immediately told them *absolutely* not. I honestly do not care how much training he has, there's not enough training where I'd trust to let my girls get off the ground in that plane. Besides, the girls have asked to go up before and I've always said no, so I don't know why my BIL would think now would be different? At least though they didn't go behind my back and promise this to the girls first.", "created_utc": 1693169626, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1631qi5/aita_for_not_letting_my_11_and_13_yo_daughters/", "score": 143, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're not TA to be worried, but to deny them the trip based on your fear is your problem, not the girls.\n\n\"There's not enough training where I'd trust to let my girls get off the ground in that plane\"... does that mean you're the type to immediately refuse to let them board a commercial airliner if you don't like the look of the plane, or the pilot?

I\u2019m a flight instructor, meaning I teach people how to fly small general aviation aircraft every day. First, your BIL\u2019s airplane is inspected at least once a year by a professional airframe and powerplant (A&P) mechanic. That person is certified by the FAA and knows what they\u2019re doing. They wouldn\u2019t sign off on your BIL\u2019s airplane being safe to fly if anything was wrong with it. Second, your BIL is a military trained pilot. He knows what he\u2019s doing.

It\u2019s valid to have concerns and some level of fear since these are your kids. However, what happens when they get older? Will the answer always be no? There may come a time when the girls come to resent you for holding back on the experience. Maybe come up with some sort of compromise to get you more comfortable with the idea? Perhaps taking a shorter trip with you (and maybe the girls) first so you can get insights in to what a flight really is like and you can trust more.\n\nEdited for clarity", "YTA.

Not for not letting your daughters go per se, but because you are letting your own fears get in the way of allowing your girls to have this experience to the point you are suggesting that your husband would endanger his own daughters just that he could go to the trip.

I\u2019ve never met a former military pilot that could not afford maintenance or inspection, they\u2019re usually on top of that stuff.\n\nAccidents in small planes are almost always attributed to weather conditions, and getting a weather briefing solves that issue.

Private aviation is a different ballgame, and even with your BIL\u2019s experience, it\u2019s ok to be overcautious.

Don\u2019t listen to these ppl. Flying commercial is what\u2019s safe. Just ask buddy Holly, patsy cline, randy Rhodes, Kobe Bryant, and all these other folks who flew private.

Small aircraft have to pass regular inspections, and the pilot has to perform a basic inspection EVERY time they fly. Do you inspect your car every time your drive? Your girls will be in FAR more danger on the ride to the airport than they will be in the air. Do you understand why even small aircraft crashes make the national news? It's because they're RARE. Even FATAL car wrecks rarely make even local news, aside from traffic reports. Let your girls have an experience. You're going to end up raising women that are afraid to take even small risks.

I was in a crash in a small plane when I was about your kids\u2019 age. You\u2019re being irrational and over the top here. The size of the aircraft has nothing to do with its safety; most crashes are due to pilot error. You say you have no doubts about BIL as a pilot, so your reasoning is 100% fear, 0% data. It\u2019s about you and how you feel, which is a terrible reason to limit your children\u2019s lives.\n\nWe can\u2019t let fear rule us.

I also suspect he maintains that plane pretty damn well.", "First, the fact that there is not room for both you and your husband to go is completely immaterial.  Your husband wants to go so he goes and you stay home.  Your presence on the airplane won't help and would arguably make it slightly less safe because no one needs a passenger having a panic attack while they are flying a plane.\n\nSecond, if he has flown with the military, he's the type of pilot that airlines would be fighting over to get in the cockpit of their planes.  Military pilots don't have to shell out money to practice while they are training and they train a lot.  So he is going to have more experience behind the stick that than almost any of the younger airline pilots.  \n\nThird, you cannot eliminate all risk from your family's life.  Most people have a poor sense of relative risk.  This is one of those circumstances.  If he were a rich newbie in the cockpit I'd say no but he's likely safer than the commercial airlines with his experience.

This is an incredible opportunity for your kids to experience something most people don\u2019t experience in their entire life.\n\nIt is scary, but this is somewhere I would encourage you to push your boundaries a bit and let go", "You aren\u2019t the Asshole. As the mother, you have the right to make decisions about your children\u2019s safety, and anyone who thinks your an asshole for not putting them in a situation you deem dangerous is overstepping(in your life, here they aren\u2019t, cause you asked, but still I disagree.).", "NAH. \n\nAll these people comparing it to being safer driving a car are completely wrong. That's true for commercial flights, but not small private aircrafts. They're estimated to be 20x more dangerous than driving and account for roughly 94% of all fatal accidents. They are pretty not safe. I'm uncomfortable with the number of times a deadly small plane crash has touched people in my life, or myself personally. Last time I went to Alaska, a small plane carrying people from my cruise crashed and they all died. It was pretty terrible. I only ever knew my neighbor as a widow because her husband died in a small plane accident right before I was born. I have a lot of other stories like that. Your fears are not unfounded. \n\nIf I were to EVER get on a plane like that, it would have to be with a pilot like your BIL. If it was someone I knew, was familiar with his flight history and track record, I might maybe work up to a small trip. It might also help to talk through the safety process and logistics with the pilot. Maybe see if you can have a frank convo with BIL and build up your level of comfort. But if it doesn't happen, I don't blame you. \n\nThis is hardly a once on a lifetime opportunity. BIL will still be their uncle when they're older. If he's still flying, he can take them when they're 18. There are plenty of other small plane trip opportunities out there with other pilots, too. If they choose to go as adults, they can.", "The size of the plane is generally irrelevant to safety, unless there's REALLY bad weather. It's the maintenance of the plane and the pilot. If you don't trust your BIL to make sure the plane is maintained properly, that's one thing.

She can make her own decisions on flying with your BIL then, as is her right, and her sister after her. Until then, a parents job is to keep their kids safe. A big part of that is trusting your instincts and, occasionally, accepting that the \u201csafe\u201d route isn\u2019t always the \u201cfun route.\n\nTo the people putting forth straw man arguments about letting your kids into cars - cars are something of a necessity nowadays. Even if you live in a city, at a certain point your kid will ride an Uber, be in a carpool, and etc. They WILL be exposed to cars and the risk of car accidents - you can\u2019t change that.

Apparently you missed the nuance of the keyword, *most*\u2026", "And you're posting here today, so that sounds like a pretty ringing endorsement of that pilot's skill.", "It was not suicide.\nJohn had only recently purchased a Long-Ez experimental home built aircraft.\nThis aircraft had a deviation from the plans with regard to placement of the fuel switchcock.\nInstead of being on the centre console between the pilots legs it was on the left rear firewall behind the pilot at about head level.\nWhen John had to switch tanks it forced him to reach behind his left shoulder to access the fuel cock. In doing so he pressed the right rudder and the aircraft entered what is known as a rudder hardover.\nHe did not have sufficient altitude over the bay to recover.", "I'm not sure of the point you are trying to make. If you compare chances of dying as a driver or passenger of a car with dying from being hit as a pedestrian, maybe (woukd have yo look up the stats) but that isn't what I am comparing. \n\nAs a pedestrian, there is 1 in 4200 chances of a car hitting you. \n\nIf you go on a small plane, there is 1 in 100000 chances of an accident for every hour you are flying. \n\nThe odds of dying in a car crash (just looked it up), just below 1% (that is massive.)\n\nOf course the car ones will depend on where you live and your age but they are averages. \n\nIn any case, small planes are still much safer.", "Right and you know a bunch of military pilots risking their families lives.", "I am a pilot. I am a private pilot with a current instrument rating, which I use for fun.\n\nI am not a professional pilot, but I am a qualified pilot, which is not the same thing.", "I absolutely disagree. Experiencing new opportunities DOES change lives. It opens doors and avenues in to passions and potentially career opportunities. If you have children, you should want them to get the most experiences they can out of life.", "If it was reserved for a small plane and their Dad wanted to go, they sure as shit would be going.", "Apparently you missed the nuance of military training not leading directly to great aeronautical decision making in small general aviation planes. In fact, I\u2019d say most military pilots scare the hell out of me", "Umm no. Surviving idiotic decision making isn\u2019t an endorsement. I made him divert to a small town in Oregon where we stayed the night. He gave me the keys to the car where we then proceeded to the Elks lodge for him to hit on widowed women. Got exceptionally drunk and attempted to fly the next day. 2 of my daughters classmates are dead because of bad ADM in a small plane. I have about 1500 hours and I\u2019ve never taken my own daughter up.", "Again I think you're comparing apples and Volkswagens. 1 in 4200 people are hit by a car but almost everybody has exposure to cars as a pedestrian. And I'm not sure where you got the stat because it sounds awfully high. Is it pedestrian fatalities, or does it include injury as well?\n\nTo make any kind of realistic comparison, you have to keep the numbers on the same basis, and I don't think these are. The right basis is fatalities per person-distance travelled. On that basis, car travel is, as I understand it, roughly as risky or slightly less so than general aviation but orders of magnitude greater than commercial flights. But most of us are still far more likely to die car-related for the simple reason that we spend more time and travel further by car...in fact very few people spend much time in a private plane at all. That is my point: the stats have to be on the same basis.", "Kind of funny that happens when your plane is based at a joint use airport isn\u2019t it?", "That wasn't my question.  So how does your children flying in large aircrafts have anything to do with this conversation.  Apples and oranges much?", "Ah yes you're the real hero, we're all very proud of you.", "Funny how that happens when you're delusional.", "I literally answered you. Not my fault you couldn\u2019t understand. They haven\u2019t gone on one of those types of planes BUT if their father ever reserved one for them, then away they would go on the small plane. Understand now?", "Go ahead and let your kids ride in a plane with someone that you have no idea about their flying ability or aeronautical decision making. Here\u2019s what happens with bad ADM.
