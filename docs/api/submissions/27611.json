Sure they were disappointed but 9.30am is late enough. The 1 time I cooked and cleaned for my husband\u2019s work friends \u2026 and didn\u2019t say a word about leaving because they were his friends\u2026 they stayed until 2am on a work night.

I will incorporate that moving forward.\n\nI truly do feel bad, cause I would have hosted them for longer if it wasn't for the fact that I felt sick. But what gets me is how they said all that even after seeing me visibly ill.", "From what they both told me, they mentioned they gad a great time before they had left. My friend's boyfriend even texted me after thanking me for everything. It's only my friend who had brought up the negatives.\n\nThank you for your validation.", "I would say 4-5 hours? I don't know how late they expected to stay... considering it was 9:30 just about, she knows I'm an early nester.", "Yeah if I was at a friend\u2019s house for dinner and they got a migraine and threw up, I\u2019d be shooing them to bed with water and painkillers and anything else they needed and doing the dishes as quietly as I could before leaving", "It put me in a weird situation overall. To your point, I wasn't kicking them out for good fun, I was just sick.", "I can understand being disappointed, after all, everyone has different expectations for different settings. I just felt like I was being called out on it. I ignored it the first time she made the comment and then the second time is when it started to really bother me. 2AM is definitely insane. \n\nI set that expectation that it was to be light and chill dinner, and not a rager. My friends all know I've limited my drinking to maybe 1-2 glasses of wine at night, and that's only with guests. I typically don't drink on my own. We don't usually get together just to get wasted either so I'm just confused what they expected to do.", "I thought the booze comment was awkward as hell... Verbatim she was like \"we're bummed we didn't get to try the good wine with dinner and neither of us had whiskey before\". I didn't even know how to reply to that except for her to let us know if they had a preference in what bottle we opened in what order next time as I didn't want to open everything at once and waste it all.", "Could you elaborate?", "That's the thing that really makes you NTA. Your friend *knows* you suffer from chronic illnesses and still decided to talk smack. You did nothing wrong.", "Then your friend is weird.   \nAs I was saying. To me you sound like a normal good host. You entertained them, fed them and unfortunately you didn't feel well enough in the end.   \nEven if you did feel good, it is perfectly fine to end the evening with \"Well, guess it is getting late. It was so great having you over. We need to repeat that some time.\" and gently tell them to leave. \n\nPerfectly normal.", "Yeah I\u2019d make the start and end time clear next time. Seems like the expected to stay late and get smashed. Maybe like, \u201chey wanna come to dinner from like 6-10\u201d", "Thank you for not making me feel like I'm crazy.", "Omg how rude!!!! The good wine? The just told you that they thought you served plonk to guests.  That is so rude!!!\n\nThey are also way off base on manners.  If they brought booze, it's impolite to ask it to be served at a dinner party .", "They wanted to socialize after dinner, smoooze etc.\n\nthe atmosphere was right for this.\n\nyou wanted to rest.", "To your note, I definitely tried to end it as graciously as I could muster. It went along the lines of \"Hey guys I'm sorry but I really feel like shit. This was great let's do it again.\"\n\nI'm sure I threw in some extra jargon in there but that was the gist of it.", "Got that as another comment, will definitely be incorporating this. Rookie hosting mistake on my end,", "Funny thing is... they bought 2 and we just randomly opened one of the two and my friend didn't bother telling us which one we wanted when I had asked for preferences.\n\nI didn't serve the whiskey they brought on the premise that I didn't want anyone to \"mix\" their alcohols since I know she's had an adverse reaction to that in the past.", "No, OP was SICK.  Huge difference.", "You did good. Don't worry!\n\nAnd look out for yourself. You should not sacrifice your well-being for the sake of pleasing others. That's how people get burned out.\n\nWhat does your husband say to this situation?", "I still don\u2019t think it\u2019s your fault. You\u2019re all adults not teenagers. They\u2019re a bit ridiculous. If they do this next time maybe get different dinner party friends.", "I had a friend who kept a lamp on an automatic timer nearby. She would tell everyone that it was the \u201cnight light\u201d for sleeping. Great visual cue because we all knew that it was time to go home when the lamp turned on. If nobody noticed, she would say, \u201cOh look the night lamp turned on. I guess it\u2019s time to wrap up.\u201d", "My Bad, that is acceptable. TY", "My husband is just as baffled as I am, but he's usually pretty chill about social scenarios that I get weirded out in. So it helps my husband is agreeing with everything we've been saying so far.", "That's actually hysterical. What would you say based on your experience is a good time to usher your guests out?", "If it is out of character for her, maybe she has something going on that bothers her and she uses you as an outlet unconsciously?   \nSometimes people do weird stuff when they are upset, even if you are not the reason they are upset. \n\nIf it is \"in character\" for her, ignore her negative comments. Just invite someone else next time and enjoy yourself :)"]}
