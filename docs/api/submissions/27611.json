To your point, I wasn't kicking them out for good fun, I was just sick.", "I can understand being disappointed, after all, everyone has different expectations for different settings. I just felt like I was being called out on it. I ignored it the first time she made the comment and then the second time is when it started to really bother me. 2AM is definitely insane. \n\nI set that expectation that it was to be light and chill dinner, and not a rager. My friends all know I've limited my drinking to maybe 1-2 glasses of wine at night, and that's only with guests. I typically don't drink on my own. We don't usually get together just to get wasted either so I'm just confused what they expected to do.", "I thought the booze comment was awkward as hell...

This was great let's do it again.\"\n\nI'm sure I threw in some extra jargon in there but that was the gist of it.", "Got that as another comment, will definitely be incorporating this. Rookie hosting mistake on my end,", "Funny thing is... they bought 2 and we just randomly opened one of the two and my friend didn't bother telling us which one we wanted when I had asked for preferences.\n\nI didn't serve the whiskey they brought on the premise that I didn't want anyone to \"mix\" their alcohols since I know she's had an adverse reaction to that in the past.", "No, OP was SICK.  Huge difference.", "You did good. Don't worry!\n\nAnd look out for yourself. You should not sacrifice your well-being for the sake of pleasing others.

She would tell everyone that it was the \u201cnight light\u201d for sleeping. Great visual cue because we all knew that it was time to go home when the lamp turned on.

There was absolutely no need to send them home with leftovers.", "NTA. \n\nAs someone who regularly has guests over at 5pm and they leave more like 11pm-12am, I would normally find 9:30pm to be quite an early to finish the evening.\n\nHowever you feeling sick completely changes things, if a host was feeling unwell I would be completely fine with leaving earlier than normal.", "Anything the couple brought was considered a hostess gift and they shouldn't be grabbing it to return home with it, what greedy gits.", "Who does that? Even *if* I had expected to stay longer because I'd been told thatn once it's voiced that it's time to skeedaddle you just git to maintain your host's desire to invite you again.

I think it would be pretty normal to say \"it's a shame you got sick, maybe next time we can have those drinks.\" Or \"that dish you made was really good, I wish I took more.\" \n\nAs other commenters have said, next time set an end date because it's not abnormal for friends to stay late talking, especially if they brought drinks and such.", "NTA", "NTA. I hosted a friend's birthday party. Drank too much and disappeared to throw up.\n\nI didn't say anything or ask them to leave, but my friends noticed, helped me clean up, and went to a bar in the neighborhood so I could go to bed.\n\nI'm sorry your friends are ungrateful and rude.", "Depending on the group a 'dinner' could be anywhere between a ~9pm finish to let everyone get home suitably early on a school night, to a post midnight event with drinking, games or whatever else.\n\nNeither is wrong, and I would never complain about an early finish if that was what the host proposed.\nIt is worth mentioning however that you do sometimes just need to be blunt and state that you are calling the evening there, rather than letting it continue on. \n\nEither way, if the host is feeling ill (and especially if they have a migraine or other illness actually causing them to be sick) then that is an instant crash stop to the evening. It isn't rude to call the night early, it is just pragmatic to have your host actually be capable of hosting, and not being forced to be socially/physically active when they feel miserable.\nAnyone who expects the night to continue is incredibly entitled, and no friend to you.\n\nSo you were perhaps naive for assuming the evening would naturally end at 21:30, but definitely NTA for wanting to call home on it yourself.", "NTA at all! I also suffer from chronic migraines, and I know how debilitating they can be. Unfortunately, abled people can sometimes not understand, and I've definitely gotten rude comments when I've had to end plans early or cancel due to them. However, what I've learned is that there are things in life that are uncontrollable, and I shouldn't punish myself by trying to \"push through\" extreme pain or by feeling guilty over my disability popping up at inconvenient times. After all, it wouldn't be a disability if it was convenient. Your friends' inability to understand your suffering is not your fault. \n\nIf their comments are really troubling you, I think bringing it up to them is a good idea. Something like \"maybe I'm taking this the wrong way, but your comments about the night ending too early make it seem like you think I purposefully ended plans instead of a sudden onset of a very painful disability that I struggle with. That honestly hurts me a little bit because I don't choose when I get hit with incredible amounts of pain, dizziness, and nausea, and it's feels rather invalidating to insinuate otherwise.\"\n\nI've had to say similar things before, sometimes resulting in negative, ignorant responses, but that just told me who I didn't need in my life. Your friends should respond well to you if you bring it up in an honest, but non confrontational way because friends are supposed to care about and want to understand one another.\n\nBest of luck in dealing with your chronic migraines. They're the worst. <3", "NTA-i personally am very up front with when ppl are expected to leave. Im the hang a banner that says \u2018leave by 9\u2019 type. But with you getting very obviously sick ? Sounds like you need new friends", "NTA - you need new dinner party friends.  Your current ones sound insufferable.", "How is someone supposed to time box an unexpected illness, though?", "How is OP a bad host for getting sick?", "How were you supposed to know you were going to get sick? That is so rude of your \u201cfriends.\u201d I can\u2019t imagine someone hosting me in their home and then being mad at them for getting ill. I\u2019d be kicking myself out and checking up on them to see how they\u2019re doing the next day.", "Yeah anyone who complains about an evening being cut short because the host is puking sick is a complete AH.", "She's out of line even complaining once about it. You were ill!", "Literally this. I get chronic migraines, my friends all know this, and they all feel worse then I do when I have to miss things/cut things short, etc and do everything possible to make my life easier when I do get them. I missed the Taylor Swift tour (that I had amazing tickets for that took me forever to get) I bailed on my friend last minute, and a few weeks later they all threw me a TSwift themed surprise bday party. Get friends like mine and ditch these awful ones.", "That\u2019s so sweet of them!", "My husband\u2019s grandpa reportedly would dramatically enter the room whilst ostentatiously winding an alarm clock. Wish I\u2019d met him.", "Sounds like they might have splurged on the wine or whiskey and we're looking forward to it. Nothing to do with you or the night probably just disappointed that they didn't get to have any, and then they left it cause it was a \"gift\"\n\nIf your plan on hosting again, just save it for next time and let them know you saved it for the next time the four of you are together. \n\nNta", "NTA\n\nBut your friends were being kind of dicks, everyone knows that as soon as the host says they are not feeling well, you should be leaving in the next 15 minutes, it's common courtesy. And then to go a head and make little comments to you is rude IMO.", "Could you be overthinking this?  It reads to me as just general chat. I completely understand regretting leaving leftovers behind at the host's house because I am full and feeling generous on the night but the next day mourning leaving behind a particular tasty item. You can also be disappointed at a good night being cut short while also understanding why it was cut short and not blaming the host for it. Neither statement is actually a criticism but more sharing of feelings and observations. If your friend is normally a nice person, I would lean towards NAH. OP didn't do anything wrong but because you feel bad about it, you misconstruing it as criticism.", "NTA. You mentioned you weren't feeling well. That was the time to leave", "NTA... \nMy husband leaves early for work so we have a start and finish time to dinner invites.\n\nWe also do lunches/brunches on weekends - people dont stay as long for those... if they make it to dinner, we suggest going out", "NTA. They over stayed their welcome tbh.", "So...what...they expected to keep partying at your house while you were puking and crashing?  Nice friends you've got there.", "My former boss had a great trick.  He would wrap up a dinner party by asking if anyone wanted a cup of coffee.  It would change the dynamic immediately.  Guests didn't feel pushed out the door but got the message that festivities and wine/cocktails were ending.\n\nI suppose there could be some one who wouldn't get the hint, but if there was I didn't see them.", "A true friend would have seen that OP was sick. And then offered to help clean up, as OP was incapacitated.", "Oh, I would have totally interpreted that as an invitation to open up a brand-new phase of lingering. Perhaps it\u2019s in the tone.", "Same for me. That definitely wouldn\u2019t have been a signal that it\u2019s time to leave. I\u2019ve been to many dinners where coffee was the next \u201cactivity\u201d. (Or just being offered in addition to drinks and whatever else.)"]}
