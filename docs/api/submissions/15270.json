Withholding allowance because she doesn't like that you got the sweater back is ridiculous.  \n\nYou handled the interaction with the other student poorly.  You knew she had received it via donation and yet you confronted her with your friends and made her say it was a donation to her.  You likely humiliated a student that already seems to be isolated.  You should have quietly had a one-on-one conversation with her and if you really wanted it back, asked her politely instead of manipulating and bullying her into returning it.", "ESH. Your mum should absolutely not have taken your sweater, and I would not give it away if it reminds you of your gran. If you are concerned that your mum won't let you keep it, give it to someone who will keep it safe for you.\n\nBut you were an AH for bullying this girl and taking the clothing off her back. It's good that you replaced the sweater, but why not get the replacement first so she didn't get cold? And why \"confront\" her with your friend gang in a public place? What you need to do now is approach her on your own, without your entourage, and give her a heartfelt apology.", "Your mom is an asshole. She had no right to give away your stuff without your permission. Although I can understand your feelings, it's not right to humiliate a girl who is in no way to blame for this situation. You could have approached her alone and talked to her, but you did what you did.", "You didn\u2019t treat that other student respectfully.  It was fine for you to retrieve it and stand up to your mom.\n\nWatch how you treat others.  Apologize to the other student despite replacing the sweater.  Also, get your pals to do that too and then do something nice for them \u2026 publicly!\n\nESH", "ESH except the girl who the sweater was donated to. Look, we know why your mom sucks. But you have to see how \"popular girl and her friends make girl feel bad about accepting donated clothes\" is not a good look", "Yes and no. Your mom fucking sucks. You could have handled the interaction with the girl better,  yta for that, but the real AH is your mom, for sure. \n\nIt's not too late to apologize to the girl and explain why it was so upsetting seeing her in the sweater.", "NTA: Your mom is because she's the one that created that whole situation. \n\nIt'd have been better if you confronted the girl in a private way and not in the cafeteria in front of others. \n\nShe probably doesn't want everyone to know that her family may be going through financial difficulties. \n\nAlso, I think your mom didn't like your grandma that much.", "ESH except that poor girl you ganged up on.  What on earth made you think that you were entitled to treat her like that?  Asking if she would be willing to trade if you got her a new sweater is one thing, but angrily confronting her and demanding she takes the sweater off is bananas.", "Some advice, OP: You definitely DON'T need to return the sweater, but you do need to apologize for humiliating the girl who received it. Getting her a different one was a great decision.\n\nAsk one of your friends if they can take your sweater and store it at their house so it's \"gone\" (as far as your mom knows/cares) but you haven't actually lost something that your grandmother lovingly MADE for you. Explain it to your friend's mom if necessary, \"My grandmother made this for me, but my mom hates it for some reason and keeps throwing it away. It's very important to me and it's in danger of being thrown away forever. Can \\[friend\\] just keep it in her dresser, here, for me?\"", "ESH \n\nYour mum is TA for donating the sweater without asking.

And exposing her that way would have made her even more embarrassed.", "ESH\n\nYour mother is controlling and manipulative and had no right to donate items that weren't hers. Just because they're under her roof does not make it hers. I can't tell how old you are but I'd be working on a plan to get even a part time job, save up, and move out when you're able to.\n\nBut you really could have handled the situation with the other girl much better. Rather than just confronting her in public like that you should have asked to talk to her in private and explained the situation, and then made your offer to replace the sweater with something new.  You could even have offered to take her shopping with you so that she could pick something out. Who knows, you could have made a new friend in the process - now she probably views you as a bully.", "NTA Your mother is. She put you in a terrible position. You did the right thing in buying the young lady a new sweater and more. Perhaps there's a relative willing to keep the sweater safe for you.", "NTA...\n\nI do feel bad for that poor girl at your school, but your mom has something seriously wrong with her.  Your DECEASED GRANDMA gave it to you, and for that alone, it's a sentimental object.\n\nEDIT - Maybe offer to reimburse the girl or maybe just give her $20 or something, but most people would be horrified to have a classmate's stolen property (which this is), so it's no surprise she handed it over.", "NTA.\n\nIts your sweater, your mother shouldn't give it away.\n\nEdit; \n\nBut You shouldn't have confronted the girl with your douce bags, she didn't know a thing and was a victim of your mothers BS, its not an asshole move since emotions could have fogged your mind and you couldn't act clearly. You saw your sweater and went straight at it, but you approached it the wrong way. Its not the best Idea as \"well-liked\" person in a school go with a bunch of friends and confront her as group. \n\nThink about it, things like that should be confronted under four eyes and not with friends....", "ESH\n\nHonestly I don't think you are wrong for getting the sweater back, but you confronting the girl in the lunch room and \"intimidating\" her by having your friends with you was a bad move. HOWEVER, You did buy her a replacement sweater but I feel like you should have used more couth. You may have embarassed that poor girl.\n\nBut your mom is the AH for giving away your sweater. She must have an issue with your grandma for her to be behaving this way. Reducing your allowance because she dislikes the sweater? Do you know why your mom hates your grandma? Just keep that sweater on you at all times because next time she might throw it away", "ESH (you and mother): Your mother\u2019s conduct is unacceptable for the obvious reason that she stole and gave away your treasured sweater.\n\nBut your confrontation with the girl was also handled poorly. You essentially bullied her for, from her perspective, accepting a donated piece of clothing that helps keep her warm. She did nothing wrong and don\u2019t deserve any of the venom you sent her way and the public embarrassment you caused her.", "Ah man. That girl is struggling with being able to get clothes so you confronted her in a gang, publicly, at school. You basically socially castrated her.\n\nPopular girl demanding the literal clothes off of poor and unpopular girl in the cafeteria is some Mean Girls shit.", "NTA.  And honestly, if that's how your mother feels about your things, you need to invest in some locks, locking drawers, and potentially a P.O. box (yes a minor can get their own in most cases).", "ESH\n\nBut reading through, you know this already. I'm sorry Mum did this, I hope to see an update that this poor girl accepted you making ammends.", "NTA. I'd be keeping the sweater at someone else's house. Wouldn't trust not to trash it next.", "ESH\nYour mom for giving away your possession.\nYou for being a bully to get it back.", "I was prepared to call you an A-H until I read the part where you got that girl a new sweater and a few more things. NTA\n\nYour mother is a callous A-H who stole from you and had the audacity to be angry when called out on her horrible behaviour. \n\nHowever, you should\u2019ve approached her in private and explained about the sweater being stolen from you.", "NTA your mom is the AH, try and hide it or stash it somewhere but your mom is the worst for giving it away, she might be so horrid that she destroys it next so try to keep it safe or see if you have options to stay somewhere for a bit so she knows your serious. \n\nNow for the girl at school. You need to go up to her without an audience and sincerely apologize. Kids who get donated clothes from the church probably aren\u2019t living the highlife and you probably embarrassed the hell out of her. You were wrong to confront her so aggressively. Explain to her the reason so she can understand why the sweater was important to you. And ask how you can make it up to her because she also might want you to acknowledge to others that you were in the wrong since your confrontation sounded public.", "NTA.   \nFirst off, I'm glad you were able to get it back! And gave the person who ended up with it a new one as well as extra.   \nSecond, it wasn't your mother's to donate. So you are well within your rights to have gotten it back.   \n\n\nI do fear however that she may try to get rid of it again. I would not blame if you kept it with you at all times in the future in fear of her doing something with it again. She's the AH, not you.", "ESH- your mom much more than you.\n\nYour mom for donating the sweater behind your back.\n\nYou slightly, for how you confronted the girl. First, if the sweater is so unique, you most likely could tell it was yours. You went over with 2 friends in the cafeteria with others witnessing the conversation.  She was probably embarrassed having to get the sweater from a church, now everyone knows.You did replace it and gave her other items. You could have handled this better, however, you wouldn't be in this situation if your mom didn't do what she did.\n\nI'm also sensing that your mom may not like that it was your grandmother that made the sweater that you love, which doesn't give her an excuse for what she did.\n\nSo, mom AH, you slight AH, not for getting it back, but for how you did it.", "Your mother is clearly in the wrong here for being obsessed over that sweater. It's yours and it carries sentimental value. Slight ESH because you confronted the quiet kid in a pretty brutal way, but I don't disagree with what you did.", "NTA \n\nYour mom absolutely is! Do you have any family members nearby you can stay with until she gets her head on straight? What does your dad think of all this?", "ESH. You could have asked the girl about the sweater without \"confronting\" her. Unless it is a handmade sweater, there is more than one in the world. Mom shouldn't have given away your stuff. My mom hated a wool sweater I had and shrunk it in the dryer so I feel your pain. Apologize to the girl and explain yourself. She did nothing wrong.", "NTA. I'm so sorry your mom is giving you zero freedom with your personal belongings. That isn't right to me and must be really hard, and it's extra messed up it's over an important and sentimental item, the sweater your grandmother made you. Is there any relative that would keep it safe for you until you're older?", "Nta\n\nYour mom is a thief, keep anything important to you locked up and hidden, get out of there as soon as you can.", "YTA - and a bully, to boot. You publicly shamed a girl who did absolutely nothing wrong but wear a sweater that happened to be yours. You owe that poor girl an apology. Can you imagine the absolute shame and embarrassment for being publicly confronted and having to admit you got your clothes from charity? And on a cold day, to have your sweater stripped from you and taken back, so not only were you shamed, now you have to go the rest of the day cold? Omg. That is awful", "You should have approached the girl wearing your sweater in a nicer way but other than that NTA. You should hide that sweater somewhere or hold it at a friends house. It is not safe from her, not sure what her deal is", "Your mom is a complete asshole. \n\nYou confronting the girl with your squad of popular girls as backup, rather than talking to her privately, is also an asshole move.\n\nSo ESH.", "I'm going to say NTA since it was stolen and you still donated another sweater to the girl. Your mom is a major one though.", "YTA. So you 100% know your issue was with your mom but instead of confronting her, you decide to use your social might to confront someone who has done nothing wrong and force her to publicly out that she is wearing second hand clothes. \n\nThe fact that you consider her \"complying\" when you finally did the right thing and offered fair exchange goes to the root of the issue.\n\nAnd then you passive aggressively wear it to have the convo you should've had with your mom to begin...like maybe WHY your mom has such disdain for an item of her deceased mothers.\n\nThis is such not the way and it wouldn't shock me theres was some real some trauma between your mom and her mom.", "YTA OP - you kind of suck marching up to a kid in school and demanding it back you embarrassed that kid and it wasn't okay.   Understanding that once you knew who had it that you would want it back but you went about all wrong.  \n\nDon't treat others in the same disregard your mother treats you.", "NAH, your mom shouldn't have donated the sweater. Maybe you could've been a bit more considerate by not confronting her in the lunch room and instead somewhere more private. But it's not like you stole the sweater from her and even offered to swap it for another sweater. Your mom is the only AH here.", "NTA. just bc your mother doesnt like it doesnt mean anything she can deal with it", "NTA", "YTA and a huge one! I  understand you wanted to have that sweater with sentimental value back and your mom made a mistake giving it away, but that was no excuse for the way you treated that girl. You ganged up on her with your friends in a public place, claiming that sweater was stolen from you, while you knew perfectly well it wasn't, your mom donated it to the church. So you also knew perfectly well how that girl got it: via church charity. Do you have any idea how much you embarrassed that poor girl by accusing her publicly of wearing a stolen sweater and make her admit she got it from charity? She must have been mortified being outed as a charity case in public by you.\n\nThe right thing to do was this: asked her for a word outside and explain the situation in private: That sweater has great sentimental value for you but your mom gave it away by mistake. And you should have made an appointment with her to go to the mall together at a moment of her convenience to buy a nice new sweater which you would pay for, if you only could get that old one back.\n\nBut no, you were only thinking about yourself and bullied and embarrassed a girl who did nothing wrong. Shame on you!", "YTA \n\nThat was an unbelievably awkward and uncomfortable situation that you put that girl in. \n\nI get that the sweater was yours and you were pissed that your mom donated it but you publicly bullied and embarrassed her to get it back. Shame on you.", "I will say it's a soft ESH to bordering N T A. Your mom definitely was the AH for taking the sweater just because she didn't like it. You weren't nice with how you confronted the girl, but at least you made it better by buying her a different sweater. Just apologize and explain why it was so important.", "NTA. You could have handled the confrontation better but you didn't just take it back but you got her a new sweater. That alone tells me not an AH.\n\nIt doesn't matter how much your mother hates the sweater, she had no right. She shouldn't even be cutting your allowance, but on that note, I would just get a job. Screw the allowance.", "NTA The girl has a better sweater, everyone wins.", "YTA\n\nYou're perfectly within your right to want your shirt back.\n\nBut the way you approached it was just such an asshole move. You marched up on this girl with friends who didn't need to be involved, in a manner you recognize as likely to be intimidating.\n\nRather than talk about your problem, you asked her a question you knew the answer to, highlighting something she'd obviously be embarrassed about, the fact that she needs donated clothes.\n\nYou could've just gotten her a spare sweater and talked to her in private, and there'd have been no issue, but you ended up really intimidating and embarrassing a girl who did nothing wrong.", "INFO:\n\nWhat the hell does the sweater look like? Is it a dick and balls on an inverted pentagram or something?\n\nWho puts this much mental energy into a SWEATER? (I understand it's from your grandmother, but why does your mother *care*?)\n\nESH because you should have approached the girl better.

That was absolutely a bully move, and you know it. And to force her to say it was donated? Yeah, you just... no. I'm not even giving you credit for being young,  because you're old enough to know exactly what you did.\n\nYour mom shouldn't have taken the sweater and donated it, but that was between you and your mom, and that poor girl you bullied had nothing to do with it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

May be best to just apologize privately.", "Yeah, don't do anything publicly. I would tell your friends you were wrong and ask them not to do anything that might embarrass her - and apologise to her. Your mom was an asshole for sure but you embarassed someone who had done nothing wrong. But you seem pretty willing to make amends.", "I would be careful doing something publicly, drawing more attention could just embarrass her more.", "Definitely do NOT do something publicly unless she specifically asks for you to do it\n\nThat\u2019s not something most people would want to happen- public apologies are only if the person being apologized to asks for it, not something that is sprung on them. \nIf you apologize to her publicly without her permission she will feel pressured by others to accept whatever apology you give her and it may further embarrass her/make her anxious from how you had previously approached her.\n\nBe sure to apologize for your actions and reassure her that the situation had nothing to do with her and everything to do with the situation with your grandma\u2019s sweater and your mom (although this last part could be left out as it\u2019s just additional context for her to understand why you were so fixated on it being donated, which may reassure her again that her wearing clothes that were donated had nothing to do with it). \n\nBuying the sweater for her was also the right thing to do, but was the sweater of the same quality of warmth? Just asking, cause if not, you may want to offer her a different sweater if her situation requires it. Because she may have been unable to find anything warmer than the sweater that was offered to her at the church and needed it for that purpose. \nJust an additional thing to consider maybe just in case :))", "Ahh i missed that... all good. I can see why that would be mortifying for the girl, but it's mom's fault.", "You could invite her to sit with you *before* someone is mean to her. That would be nice.", "I\u2019m glad to hear that. \n\nYou acted with your emotion here and it is understandable to a point. It just wasn\u2019t her fault so I hope she doesn\u2019t get made fun of.", "You were already mean to her. You should invite her to sit with you now, not wait for someone else to be mean to her. Teenagers often don\u2019t think about the impacts of their actions, but if this girl and her family are struggling to the point of needing clothing donations from church, she will likely never forget the time the popular girl at school came up to her in the cafeteria, forced her to admit in front of people that the sweater was a donation, and then *made her take it off and give it to her right then and there*", "Oops. I missed that.", "More reasons to not bring that young lady into this.", "EXACTLY, you were almost completely correct in how you resolved it. fix this small issue and afterward you will be an even better person than before.", ">understand why your emotions took over when you saw someone else wearing your beloved sweate\n\nI was really upset when I saw a girl wearing my favorite handmade sweater. I had lost it at school. Her mom helped lay out the lost and found at the end of the year (where we were supposed to look for our lost stuff)  and used it as a shopping trip. I wasn't the only kid who saw her wearing my clothes. That mom sucked too.", ">I offered to get her a new sweater by the end of the day which I ended skipping class to do so and got her more than just a sweater.\n\nper the post, OP already made good on their promise to make the schoolmate whole and then some.", "Very good point.", "OP should do it privately BUT make sure she tells her friends what she\u2019s doing so they know. And maybe slip it in the apology too.", "maybe privately ask the student what they want and only publicly do something after agreeing with them", "Cannot upvote this enough. If this kid is quiet, and has already been humiliated, please don't do anything public before apologising privately and checking if she would want that.", "I just wanted my sweater back, but I completely understand now that the way I went about it was wrong and will apologize \ud83d\udcaf"]}
