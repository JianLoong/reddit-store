{"id": 18002, "submission_id": "13pu2sy", "title": "AITA for taking my revoking my daughters driving privileges after finding out she is using 2 feet?", "selftext": "My (37F) daughter (16F) is in the process of navigating the roads as a new driver. She began studying for and got her permit when she was 15, and had since been receiving driving lessons from my ex husband (40M) She passed her driving test (written and physical portion) and is an outstanding student, so my ex and I decided to gift her a car as her 16th birthday gift (after receiving her license). \n\nGrowing up, my dad was the one who taught me and my siblings how to ride a bike, and later how to drive.  It is a fond memory I have of him, so I decided to let her father handle the driving lessons/teaching business, so they could have that as well. Apparently, during these lessons, my daughter started off by using both of her feet. Right foot for the gas, left for the brake. She continued to drive this way for a while, even passing her test this way. Apparently when my ex husband found out about this, he brought it up to her and asked her to correct it but she argued that she has been driving this way since she started and that reverting to the normal way would be potentially dangerous, and that she is uncomfortable doing so. So my ex husband just dropped it. \n\nI, how ever, was extremely concerned when I found this out (via her dad during casual convo). I asked him if he thought this was appropriate and he said he saw nothing wrong and that she was a good driver, I disagreed and told him this was unsafe and that I would be having a chat with our daughter once she arrived home from school. She did, I asked her to sit down, and tried to explain to her the dangers of what she is doing. Wear and tear on the brakes, potentially pressing the wrong pedal in a split second emergency situation, not to mention the higher chance of having your foot on the break the entire time, which is not only annoying to other drivers (with them not being able to know whether you are actually breaking or not) and again, dangerous. \n\nI asked her to please take these points into consideration and change her method of driving, to which she argued the only real danger would be forcing her to switch to using only one foot for both pedals after driving for this way for so long. I told her she has only been driving for about a year more or less, and the same way she learned with two she could learn with one, to which she flat out refused. \n\nAfter our conversation and her refusal I took her keys and told her I would be taking her to school from now on, and wherever else need be. She was upset and called her dad, who called me to tell me I\u2019m an AH and being controlling. He reminded me that her driving record is fine the way she is driving thus far (but it\u2019s only been a year) and that she will resent me for this. \n\nSo, AITA? I don\u2019t want to come off as controlling and I definitely don\u2019t want my daughter to resent me over this. I am\ngenuinely concerned for her safety over this and am not sure what to do now. \n\n*ETA: It is an automatic.\n**ETA: age of daughter", "created_utc": 1684860829, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pu2sy/aita_for_taking_my_revoking_my_daughters_driving/", "score": 5998, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She began studying for and got her permit when she was 15, and had since been receiving driving lessons from my ex husband (40M) She passed her driving test (written and physical portion) and is an outstanding student, so my ex and I decided to gift her a car as her 16th birthday gift (after receiving her license). \n\nGrowing up, my dad was the one who taught me and my siblings how to ride a bike, and later how to drive.  It is a fond memory I have of him, so I decided to let her father handle the driving lessons/teaching business, so they could have that as well. Apparently, during these lessons, my daughter started off by using both of her feet. Right foot for the gas, left for the brake. She continued to drive this way for a while, even passing her test this way. Apparently when my ex husband found out about this, he brought it up to her and asked her to correct it but she argued that she has been driving this way since she started and that reverting to the normal way would be potentially dangerous, and that she is uncomfortable doing so. So my ex husband just dropped it. \n\nI, how ever, was extremely concerned when I found this out (via her dad during casual convo). I asked him if he thought this was appropriate and he said he saw nothing wrong and that she was a good driver, I disagreed and told him this was unsafe and that I would be having a chat with our daughter once she arrived home from school. She did, I asked her to sit down, and tried to explain to her the dangers of what she is doing. Wear and tear on the brakes, potentially pressing the wrong pedal in a split second emergency situation, not to mention the higher chance of having your foot on the break the entire time, which is not only annoying to other drivers (with them not being able to know whether you are actually breaking or not) and again, dangerous. \n\nI asked her to please take these points into consideration and change her method of driving, to which she argued the only real danger would be forcing her to switch to using only one foot for both pedals after driving for this way for so long. I told her she has only been driving for about a year more or less, and the same way she learned with two she could learn with one, to which she flat out refused. \n\nAfter our conversation and her refusal I took her keys and told her I would be taking her to school from now on, and wherever else need be. She was upset and called her dad, who called me to tell me I\u2019m an AH and being controlling. He reminded me that her driving record is fine the way she is driving thus far (but it\u2019s only been a year) and that she will resent me for this. \n\nSo, AITA? I don\u2019t want to come off as controlling and I definitely don\u2019t want my daughter to resent me over this. I am\ngenuinely concerned for her safety over this and am not sure what to do now.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The second way it causes accidents is that in moments where you may need to make a split second decision, such as a child running out into the street in front of your car, you may have a reaction where you instinctively press down *both* feet hard.

Probably the biggest one is automatic transmissions simply aren't designed for this sort of abuse, they often use the brake/gas as the switches for certain internal components including ones that are meant to slow down/stop parts of a planetary gearset. the ABS is also designed with that in mind, & this will have negative effects on brake pads, rotors as well as potentially the entire hydraulic system.

When my right foot is on the gas, my left foot is on the floor. When my left foot is on the brake, my right foot is on the floor. My brain makes the switchover without confusion. My driving is smooth, not jerky. I do not wear out my brakes or damage the car in any way.", "Agree. I can drive either way but in heavy traffic I prefer two feet because I can transition more smoothly and quickly. I drove solely two feet for many years and my brakes have never worn prematurely.", "Yeah, I don't understand if people are just uncoordinated. Right is go, left is stop. In a panic situation, left is priority. Feet never rest on the pedals, and are always an inch away but my brake reaction is faster than if I only used 1 foot.", "\nShe really shouldn't be building up more muscle memory in the wrong form. She might need to go back to some supervised driving, and simplified driving (limiting speed, traffic, etc) since she kind of will be relearning some things. \n\nMaybe try having her take her left sock and shoe off while driving as a reminder. It won't keep her from using it if she needs to panic stop, but a bare foot on the pedal is not comfortable, and there's instant feedback when you do it wrong. \n\nPeople who drive with two feet tend to lurch the car a lot more when starting and stopping, which is damn annoying as a passenger. Plus some cars systems are sensitive enough to register the foot resting on the brakes, and thus the brake lights are burning constantly, making it impossible for the people behind you to know if there actually is a reason to prepare to stop. You can't tap your brakes as a warning if your brake lights are always on.", "I'm pretty sure the tester has all the authority possible in the scenario and can fail you for any reason.  I've never heard of someone appealing a decision made by them at least, or if there even is a process of appeal at all", "Yeah, I'm so fucking confused. As a Brit, not only is using two feet like this the norm, it's the way you're taught! Driving with only one foot sounds weird to me...", "I did this in a taco bell parking lot space. My foot went to the gas and not the break and I climbed up the building.  Worse part they called the cops because of my dad and I yelling at each other in the parking lot. Thankfully the cops didn't see the front. After we ate cause why not ... my dad drove home \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I drive an automatic with two feet, and have for over 25 years.

I pointed to the knob that controlled the windshield wipers. She said no and pointed to something else. I said, \"oh the defrost button!\" The liquid that came out of the world was literally called de-icer. I told her that and she really wanted to hold it against me that I misunderstood what she said.\n\nThat button was important, and everyone who drives there should know about it, but her issue was stupid.", "Listen I sit like a pretzel (when not driving) and I\u2019m having trouble imagining a way to do this that it wouldn\u2019t be a)uncomfortable as hell b)in the way of her left elbow c)require so much slouching she can\u2019t see out the windshield or d)all of the above", "I agree with you about everyone should learn to drive a manual transmission. I taught both my kids in a manual and they've both thanked me at various times over the years when they were forced to drive a manual or a motorcycle.\n\nOP's daughter will be the subject of road rage if she doesn't learn the correct way and no one needs to deal with that if at all possible. You can always tell when you're behind a left foot breaker - they speed up and slow down continuously.", "I failed the test the first time.\n\nDude was super nice, very calm and low key the whole time.\n\nGot back to the DMV, he had a massive list the only valid one I considered was the fact that I did a curb check while leaving the DMV.  I think that set the stage for the rest of it.\n\nSecond time just a few days later, I got the drill sergeant from hell.  He was literally screaming the entire time.  Going down a residential street with cars on both sides \"YOU'RE TOO FAR TOWARDS THE MIDDLE GET OVER NOW!  DO IT AGAIN AND I WILL FAIL YOU!\"\n\nGoing left at an intersection \"YOU'RE WAITING FOR TOO BIG OF A GAP!  IMPEDE TRAFFIC AND I WILL FAIL YOU ON THE SPOT!\"\n\nSo on and so forth.  Got to the DMV and he gave me a perfect score.\n\nTalk about polar opposites.", "I\u2019m an early 90s millennial and I learned how to drive on a manual. Many of my same-aged friends can drive them too. It\u2019s really not that uncommon. I don\u2019t think the difference between 80s and 90s kids is as big as you think it is.", "It\u2019s way more exciting to drive manual for sure. Feel like Initial D going around turns. Automatic has made the loopy Beltway way easier to do at higher speeds honestly. Before I used to get an adrenaline rush.", "The left foot is also for when you're a passenger and the driver isn't responding fast enough to your right foot on the imaginary brake so you gotta press the floorboards with both feet.", "My county's DMV was notoriously tough on their driving exams, so when I passed my first attempt even after making several mistakes and my car starting to break down during the test I was surprised. Was told awhile later that they were so tough that a new manager had told the examiners to lay off, and I was tested during the first week after the policy change and they probably overcompensated.", "Probably not just one.

Gradual speed and gradual slow down. Easy on the equilibrium.", "Don't you need to get a different licence to drive a manual?\n\nIn Australia, you can get a manual licence, which means you can drive automatic also.

People always say this.", "Yeah, I realized that as soon as I hit \"post.\"", "Yeah I went to a terrrrrrrible driving school! My driving test was driving to get on the highway, going a few miles, exiting, getting back on the highway, and driving home. I remember driving with my now-husband for the first time after getting my license (and making a series of dangerous mistakes because I didn\u2019t know any better) and he yelled something to the effect of \u201cdid this driving school teach you ANYTHING???\u201d Nope, they did not!", "Honestly initially I was like what\u2019s wrong bc I drive a manual with two feet. Then when she updated it about it being an automatic I was like ohhh.\n\nI considered it harder or very bizarre to drive with 2 feet instead of one with an automatic. She\u2019s only been driving 1 yr so she should be able to retain her foot placing pretty easy.", "Not in Canada and the US. Nearly all cars are automatic, so that's all most people ever learn. If you're under 60, there's a good chance you've never driven manual. I learned in Australia as a 30 year old, but have never driven one in North America. Even truck driving schools here teach automatic nowadays.", "Whoa I never knew this. I'm American and the idea of different license options is interesting.", "I've always heard it as, essentially, there are still enough manual cars out there that you could, hypothetically, find yourself in a situation where it's an emergency and the only available vehicle to get somewhere is a stick shift.\n\nMe, I love driving stick, flat refuse buy an automatic, and I feel like it teaches a driver to pay closer attention to their car.", "I agree, it absolutely depends on the instructor's mood.  The first time I took the driver's exam, my instructor was in a bad mood as soon as he got in my car.  The first thing he  told me to do was to put my emergency blinker on, I hesitated for a moment, and he failed me over that. \n\nThe second time I took the rest, my instructor was a nice guy who seemed to be in a good mood.  I was doing well on my test until it came time to parallel park, I kept hitting the cones.  I should've rightfully failed, but the instructor told me it was OK because I was just nervous.  No I wasn't, I just couldn't parallel park.  He passed me and 25 years later, I still can't parallel park.", "I love manual as well. You get so much more control over the car than with an automatic.", "YTA\n\nBut since you got mostly  NTAs due to the absurdity of reddit I guess your daughter is getting shafted and you get to feel like a hero for shafting her.\n\nThere is not a single credible study that sais one feet is better than two or that one is safer than the other.\n\nWhat you are completely missing is the fact that she is comfortable and confident at using two feet.\n\nThe single  MOST dangerous people on the round are those that drive and you can sense they aren't comfortable at their own car. I used to drive long haul for some years in my youth... Always the trouble came from insecure /scared motorist that were not feeling the car they were driving...

So long as she is not dragging her brakes, there should be no problem with her driving 2 footed.", "My dad used to smack our left knees when my siblings and I drove with two feet when we were learning. Not enough to hurt and not with a big enough flourish to cause our steering to faulted but enough to be extremely annoying and make us stop.", "Lol yes this is why believe everyone should have to do their driver's test in a standard car.
