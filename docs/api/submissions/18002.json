She began studying for and got her permit when she was 15, and had since been receiving driving lessons from my ex husband (40M) She passed her driving test (written and physical portion) and is an outstanding student, so my ex and I decided to gift her a car as her 16th birthday gift (after receiving her license). \n\nGrowing up, my dad was the one who taught me and my siblings how to ride a bike, and later how to drive.  It is a fond memory I have of him, so I decided to let her father handle the driving lessons/teaching business, so they could have that as well. Apparently, during these lessons, my daughter started off by using both of her feet. Right foot for the gas, left for the brake. She continued to drive this way for a while, even passing her test this way. Apparently when my ex husband found out about this, he brought it up to her and asked her to correct it but she argued that she has been driving this way since she started and that reverting to the normal way would be potentially dangerous, and that she is uncomfortable doing so. So my ex husband just dropped it. \n\nI, how ever, was extremely concerned when I found this out (via her dad during casual convo). I asked him if he thought this was appropriate and he said he saw nothing wrong and that she was a good driver, I disagreed and told him this was unsafe and that I would be having a chat with our daughter once she arrived home from school. She did, I asked her to sit down, and tried to explain to her the dangers of what she is doing. Wear and tear on the brakes, potentially pressing the wrong pedal in a split second emergency situation, not to mention the higher chance of having your foot on the break the entire time, which is not only annoying to other drivers (with them not being able to know whether you are actually breaking or not) and again, dangerous. \n\nI asked her to please take these points into consideration and change her method of driving, to which she argued the only real danger would be forcing her to switch to using only one foot for both pedals after driving for this way for so long. I told her she has only been driving for about a year more or less, and the same way she learned with two she could learn with one, to which she flat out refused. \n\nAfter our conversation and her refusal I took her keys and told her I would be taking her to school from now on, and wherever else need be. She was upset and called her dad, who called me to tell me I\u2019m an AH and being controlling. He reminded me that her driving record is fine the way she is driving thus far (but it\u2019s only been a year) and that she will resent me for this. \n\nSo, AITA? I don\u2019t want to come off as controlling and I definitely don\u2019t want my daughter to resent me over this. I am\ngenuinely concerned for her safety over this and am not sure what to do now. \n\n*ETA: It is an automatic.\n**ETA: age of daughter", "created_utc": 1684860829, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pu2sy/aita_for_taking_my_revoking_my_daughters_driving/", "score": 2638, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She began studying for and got her permit when she was 15, and had since been receiving driving lessons from my ex husband (40M) She passed her driving test (written and physical portion) and is an outstanding student, so my ex and I decided to gift her a car as her 16th birthday gift (after receiving her license). \n\nGrowing up, my dad was the one who taught me and my siblings how to ride a bike, and later how to drive.  It is a fond memory I have of him, so I decided to let her father handle the driving lessons/teaching business, so they could have that as well. Apparently, during these lessons, my daughter started off by using both of her feet. Right foot for the gas, left for the brake. She continued to drive this way for a while, even passing her test this way. Apparently when my ex husband found out about this, he brought it up to her and asked her to correct it but she argued that she has been driving this way since she started and that reverting to the normal way would be potentially dangerous, and that she is uncomfortable doing so. So my ex husband just dropped it. \n\nI, how ever, was extremely concerned when I found this out (via her dad during casual convo). I asked him if he thought this was appropriate and he said he saw nothing wrong and that she was a good driver, I disagreed and told him this was unsafe and that I would be having a chat with our daughter once she arrived home from school. She did, I asked her to sit down, and tried to explain to her the dangers of what she is doing. Wear and tear on the brakes, potentially pressing the wrong pedal in a split second emergency situation, not to mention the higher chance of having your foot on the break the entire time, which is not only annoying to other drivers (with them not being able to know whether you are actually breaking or not) and again, dangerous. \n\nI asked her to please take these points into consideration and change her method of driving, to which she argued the only real danger would be forcing her to switch to using only one foot for both pedals after driving for this way for so long. I told her she has only been driving for about a year more or less, and the same way she learned with two she could learn with one, to which she flat out refused. \n\nAfter our conversation and her refusal I took her keys and told her I would be taking her to school from now on, and wherever else need be. She was upset and called her dad, who called me to tell me I\u2019m an AH and being controlling. He reminded me that her driving record is fine the way she is driving thus far (but it\u2019s only been a year) and that she will resent me for this. \n\nSo, AITA? I don\u2019t want to come off as controlling and I definitely don\u2019t want my daughter to resent me over this. I am\ngenuinely concerned for her safety over this and am not sure what to do now.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

As far as making up reasons- what is there to really worry about? The government is going to audit them for fraud or send an undercover student? It's 100% believable that someone would fail a lot of students.", "I don't know where you live, but it would be nice if that was case everywhere (well, except for not having two feet rules when the vehicle is an automatic).  It is absolutely NOT the case here.", "The lady that did mine failed me because her granddaughter didn\u2019t like me. As soon as she saw my name and where I went to school, she asked if I knew her. I said I did but nothing else. I did nothing wrong, she didn\u2019t say a word the entire time. We got back and she went in the building to the back and told me to sit tight. She came back and said I failed and I could come back in 30 days to try again (which was wrong because it is only 7 days to wait to retest). Then smirked and told me to tell her granddaughter hello. My parents complained and it was enough that another officer asked why I had failed and she said I just needed more practice. I waited the 7 days and went to a different DMV and passed.", "I learnt in a manual and have driven manual for the vast majority of my life. I had an automatic for a while and it took me SO LONG to stop 'air clutching' and trying to depress the non-existent pedal when I wanted to stop!", "you still only one foot for braking and gas when driving a manual..", "You would never use one foot one the gas and one on the brake in a manual either. Im really not getting how so many manual users are having such a hard time understanding this.", "I won't go back to a manual now. I'm too lazy.", "Yes to all but it is not okay to rest your foot on the clutch. That is what the foot rest is for. This is called riding the clutch. You should only touch the clutch if you are using it. Resting your foot on the clutch will cause the clutch to slip and cause excessive wear.", "Note: if you're on a right hand drive country, the gas and brake pedals are still on the right hand side. Because right is the dominant side preference of a human body. (Also honestly seems to make more sense to be on the right for right hand countries, as it means your right foot is on the pedals next to the side of the car frame - means you really can't accidentally miss NOR can the passenger interfere)", "Yeah absolutely, I drive manual and while you can slow by de-accellarating it's recommended not to unless it's a gradual process. You are meant to use the brakes if you are slowing over a shorter distance as although it's not great for the car it signals to other road users that cars ahead are slowing.", "No it\u2019s not about wear on the literal pedal, it\u2019s about the wear on the vehicle if you accidentally press down on the gas and brakes at the same time - even slightly.\n\nSimultaneously engaging the braking system while applying acceleration is terrible for a vehicle and can lead to unpredictable and unnatural changes in speed that are dangerous to other drivers.  It can also lead to the brake lights turning on even when the vehicle is not actually slowing down - also dangerous \n\nYou only use your right foot on an automatic to ensure you only hit the gas OR brakes, never both", "You need to depress the clutch with your left foot when you break with your right to prevent the car from stalling", "Smart dad", "Why would the tester even be looking at her legs or feet to notice. They're looking at the road...", "Oh gosh, at least ours were free for the first 3! But our testing area wasn\u2019t the DMV for some reason. It was a police station that was specifically for the drivers tests and the test givers were badged officers. Our lady just genuinely didn\u2019t believe that you should drive until you were a legal adult but if you were of age for your license and were exponentially great then she would go ahead and pass you. But luckily they kept 3 officers there so you had a 2/3 chance to get one of the people that went purely off of skill", "Luckily with her it was a 1/3 chance to get her because they kept 3 full time testers. My county\u2019s DMV I\u2019m fairly certain doesn\u2019t even give tests. We have to go to either the county north or south of us. The one to the north, you had to know how to parallel park, and almost nowhere near us other than one town really has parallel parking so almost everyone avoids there because none of us know how to do it. And to the south, it\u2019s a mini police station that\u2019s specifically for giving driving exams. Which the one to the south is the one I refer to as \u201cmy testing area\u201d. It\u2019s just easier to go through quickly so I tried to leave a full explanation for a secondary comment", "I passed my DMV test the first time but then I was made to take the test again when I needed to use hand controls. The DMV tester literally was confused why I had to take the again and didn't pass me but said that I already had my license, so, I should be fine. Like what?? I was so annoyed", "> Which to this day I remember very well and call out everyone doing it wrong(about 95% of people doing it do it wrong it seems).\n\n???? What is it??? Why say it like this and not share what it is?", "There was a lady like that at our DMV. She terrified me and I wasn\u2019t the only one.", "It sounds like this could have very well been that he actually failed and then the tester added on that it was a good lesson for him to fail, and he interpreted that as being the ONLY reason.", "So, let me get this straight\u2026 your cousin, who is/was an overachieving straight A student who has never failed anything in his life\u2026 tells you *that\u2019s* why he failed his driver\u2019s test and you\u2026 believe him? \n\nI\u2019ve never seen anyone with more incentive to lie. Your cousin was lying to you. Maybe the DMV person *said* that, but if so\u2026 it was only to make your cousin feel better for whatever he did to ACTUALLY fail. \n\nI was a straight A overachiever who to this day is still a careful driver and I failed my first driver\u2019s test for turning into the wrong lane. (Started a turn in the left lane on a two lane turn and ended in the right. I followed the semi in front of me because I was taught you follow the car in front of you, but bam! Automatic fail lmao)", ">And I believe him because he was an overachieving straight A student\n\nThis sounds like a very, very good reason *not* to believe him.", "Type A personality, insane overachiever here-- it's unlikely as fuck your cousin was flunked for driving too well, being too attentive, signalling too perfectly-- just because the test giver wanted to humble Mr. Perfect.\n\nI failed to exit the parking lot for a couple tests for issues parallel parking and you know what; that was on me. The test administrator has a billion better things to do with their day than flunk you for being too good a driver or try to humble you for being too damn good.\n\nAlso, it's *wouldn't have*, not wouldn't of.", "I was an overachieving straight a student who to this day is an excellent driver and I failed my driving test the first time I took it bc I bumped over the curb on the test course as I left the 3 point turn box (after making a perfect 3 point turn and parallel parking with ease) it was a big car and a small course. I told everyone i left my glasses at home the first day and that\u2019s why I had to go back the second day.", "Lol, I was an overachieving straight A student. I was/am also a grade A fucking liar.\n\nYou got scammed by your cousin dude, sorry.", "Having straight As has nothing to do with driving lol, I have straight As and failed my driving test the first time", "People who never fail have a hard time dealing with failure. They\u2019ll make up any old shit to hide the truth.", "Or reaching for the stick!", "Automatic transmission with manual mode.  (almost) best of both worlds:  I can be lazy in bumper to bumper traffic, but I can also drop it from 6th to 3rd on the highway to pass someone in a hurry.  Only thing you don't get is feathering the clutch.", "now imagine that but using your left foot for braking and resting your left foot on the brake. \n\nit runs the brake lights, drags your brakes, and increases chances of you accidentally slamming on the brakes.", "And she's riding around with both feet on the pedals simultaneously. One on the gas and one on the  brake *at the same time.*", "Thanks!  I have never driven right hand drive, husband did all the driving overseas since he's used to it and i am weirded out by shifting with my left hand\n\n\nBut, how would a passenger interfere with the pedals on either side? There's like a whole lot of stuff in the way. I can barely reach the pedals with my hands sitting in the passenger seat and no way is it happening with my feet unless I'm stradling the centre console", "Ofc I wasn\u2019t talking about \u201cwear to the literal pedal\u201d. I commented above that dual foot \u201cdiminishes the life of the vehicle.\u201d          \nI also referred to how having your hand on the stick wears out components faster, speaking to a manual transmission driver who likely already knows to not do that.", "He is awesome.", "Our DMV had the first 3 attempts free, and we had an older guy that was notorious for failing basically everyone. He even failed me on my first attempt, but I did pull into oncoming traffic... I don't blame him, don't take the test after being up for 48 hours.", "I think they had more than one tester, but somehow all the teenagers always got assigned to the tester who failed all teenagers.", "Or mister perfect had a little overachiever meltdown (as we do, Type As are not known to accept failure lightly or gracefully) and the DMV person or test admin was trying to soften the blow by reassuring him that a little bit of failure is good for character development and it's an opportunity to see where you can improve yourself and your skills.", "Agreed. That\u2019s precisely the type of person who would make up a reason like that to retain their reputation.", "Yeah that\u2019s exactly what I was thinking too.", "Come on guys. Don't you think he knows his cousin better than you do? If he says he's genuine we should stop telling him his cousin is a liar. You're all very quickly jumping to your own twist of the story.", "Ha, yes! See also hiring a right hand drive car in Europe and spending the first few days reaching into the door pocket with my left hand when I try to change gear. Muscle memory is strong!", "Yes, I agree that is stupid, dangerous, and will cause wear. I am not the person that asked what the problem is. I only chimed in because the person I replied to said it was okay to rest your foot on the clutch. But it\u2019s not okay to do that.", "Depending on the front seat type and car type (think the old bench seat cars from the 60-80's), you could slide across as a pessenger and there was no console break blocking the access of passenger to reach the pedals with their feet.\n\nMy parents had one of these for a lot of my childhood, and even though we are right hand drive, you could essentially reach across with a foot the whole way from the passenger side and slam on the brake/accelerator if you wanted to. Same for left hand drive cars. And my parents had MANY stories of their early driving with friends who would press the pedals \"for a laugh\" when they were in their teens in the 70's, and it would have to be a lot easier if the pedals were on the same side as the passenger compared to right hand drive.", "Absolutely. Like\u2026 why would the dmv driver assume he\u2019s never failed before in the first place\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02"]}
