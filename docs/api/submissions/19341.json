My parents were very supportive of them trying to work things out for the sake of the children. Things seemed to be going well, Vicky and the kids would go stay with Joe on his days off. When I was asked for advice from Vicky, I would always advise her with caution because I have/had no trust or respect for Joe after what he did. This was always met with anger from my sister and I eventually gave up trying to reason with her.\nAbout two months ago, my boyfriend (25M) and I also moved to the state my family resides in as I\u2019m currently 6 months pregnant with my first child and wanted to be closer to my family. A week ago, my boyfriend and I went out to dinner and we saw Joe with another woman. I took photos and sent them to Vicky, telling her that I do not know what the context is, it definitely looks like a date. When Vicky confronted Joe, he was honest and told her she was a girl he\u2019d met and taken interest in and that it was a date. Vicky was hurt and begged him to still continue trying to work things out with her, to which he agreed and supposedly cut off communication with the girl.\nNow where I may the AH, a couple days after this Joe called me to apologize for what I saw and the position he put me in, and also asked me what I thought he should do. He was on speaker, and my boyfriend and I both had a conversation with him where we pretty much advised him that if he didn\u2019t truly want to be in a relationship with Vicky then he needed to let her go. Joe said his reasoning for trying was for the kids\u2019 sake, and we told him that watching their parents go through this back and forth is going to hurt them more than help them in the end. That same night, Joe called Vicky and told her he didn\u2019t want to hurt her anymore and that he was not going to try for a relationship with her, only his kids. I\u2019m sure he told Vicky about our conversation, because she has been blowing up my phone telling me that I ruined her chance at happiness, that I destroyed her family, and that I should\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself.

Ultimately you did you sister a huge favor if she had gotten married to him regardless if she had more kids she would\u2019ve only suffered more she would\u2019ve become paranoid and her anxiety would be worse because she would never be able to trust him because he\u2019s proven that emotionally he doesn\u2019t care about her. It may take awhile but your sister will realize how much you helped her as well as realize she deserves so much more than what joe gave her. Also I\u2019m sorry about your mom maybe go low contact if you can.", "NTA. He asked for your opinion and was mad because you gave it? He is a grown man and should take responsibility of his actions. No matter the advice you gave him whether good or bad (it was good imo) HE took the decision to take your advice which makes HIM and only HIM responsible for the outcome.", "NTA. He sought out your advice and you gave him a reasonable answer, and the right one imo. You didn\u2019t randomly call him up and tell him to leave your sister alone, you told him to not continue fucking with whatever stability she and the kids are trying to maintain if he didn\u2019t really love her. Your sister is in pain, but hopefully she will come around and realize you are not in any way the reason her family is not together. Your parents are wild for their reaction, but maybe it\u2019s just boomer-era \u2018stay together for the kids\u2019 stuff. Either way, this is on Joe and not you. Give it time.", "NTA\n\nYou are right.  You experienced what it was like to see parents make up and separate, often. It is possibly where you sister learned this behavior was acceptable.\n\nYour sister is hurt and angry, and you are the easy target because Joe talked with YOU.\n\nShe will be better off in the future, but it will take time to establish herself, and learn to coparent with Joe.", "YTA. Stay in your lane. You should have told him that it was between him and Vicky to sort out. \n\nSounds like you couldn\u2019t get Vicky to give up on him so when presented with an opportunity to approach it from the other side, you took it. \n\nNote: I don\u2019t think your opinion is WRONG. I think that is the inevitable option. But much better to support your sister instead of driving for the goal that YOU want, when YOU are ready. You obviously care a lot about her but I don\u2019t agree with your approach here.", "NTA. He asked for your opinion and you gave it to him. What he decided to do about it was on him, not you. \n\nYour sister and her kids deserve to be with someone that wants to be with them because he truly enjoys them and their company. Not because he just thinks he needs to be there because of the kids. There is a reason why he keeps going out with other women - he is not happy with your sister. It's so much better that they go their separate ways now so that they can go out and find their person. If not, it will be a vicious circle of him cheating, her finding out and blaming herself and trying to change who she is so that he will want her, him lying and telling her it'll never happen again, things will be good for a bit, then it starts all over again.", "NTA, you did not wreck her marriage.  Thankfully she did not end up pregnant again. Thankfully he did walk out on his family because his side thing was pregnant or had his kid. Lucky, she did not end up with a STD. How many other side things or hook-ups did he have over their relationship.", "NTA  \nJoe seems relentlessly self-centred and his effect on your whole family is destructive. Both your delusional mother and deeply hurt sister will realise this one day.", "I don't think you can ruin a family that wasn't really one in the first place. AND, YTA here. You crossed a boundary. I understand why you did it, but it was still a poor choice. You basically decided to insert yourself into their relationship. Just because he asked for your thoughts about what to do doesn't mean it was appropriate for you to give them, and once you did, he could then abdicate his own responsibility for the demise of their relationship to you. Well played on his part.", "NTA - anybody would give that same piece of advice. \n\nBeing in a relationship \u201cfor the kids\u201d isn\u2019t going to help either party be their best version of themselves as a parent, and not to mention, Vicky shouldn\u2019t be nor want to be in a relationship with someone who clearly doesn\u2019t want to be in a relationship with her.", "NTA - Poor Vicky but it really sounds like it is for the best. Her expectations and self respect is probably at an all time low because of this guy and she thinks the best she deserves is some cheater. But she is wrong, and if she can get past the pain and victimhood I'm sure there are plenty great people who will be interested.", "NTA you should move closer to your boyfriends family and get away from your toxic relatives", "He had called to apologize for what I saw at the restaurant and also to tell me he wasn\u2019t mad at me for telling my sister, although I wouldn\u2019t have cared if he was because that was something I still don\u2019t think i should have kept to myself. I do realize now that as far as giving him any input, I should\u2019ve just stayed out of it. But as far as asking for the advice, that was mostly geared towards my boyfriend who was in the room with me when he called, but we had the same opinion and we both shared with him our thoughts. My boyfriend is a few years older than me, so closer in age to Joe and also a guy, and before the cheating they had gotten along very well when we had visited them for a few weeks over a year ago.", "I haven\u2019t understood my mother\u2019s position this entire time. She\u2019s been extremely supportive of them working things out regardless of the cheating and his overall push and pull attitude with my sister since everything blew up. She\u2019s kinda always been borderline sexist (imo) when it comes to men my sister and I have dated. Any disagreement i\u2019ve had with my current boyfriend or any ex boyfriends she\u2019s always taken the guy\u2019s side, even when he\u2019s been dead wrong and she\u2019s been the same with my sister. I\u2019ve never understood why she\u2019s like this, but yea I guess it could simply boil down to her generation and the time she grew up in.", "When I was in high school, I dated Joe\u2019s cousin. He\u2019d told me that during the beginning of their relationship Joe cheated on my sister repeatedly. I did tell her about this, but when she confronted Joe he adamantly denied it. I will likely never know if that was true or not but I would put money on the fact that it probably is true, and it was probably throughout their relationship too. But like i said, i\u2019ll never know or be able to prove it.", "Yeah, my boyfriend suggested that he likely knew my feelings already and wanted to end the relationship anyways, but decided to manipulate the situation to seem like I made him do this. I do think I should\u2019ve just ignored his call after all that\u2019s happened. Yes, I wanted her to leave him because I know she deserves better and I hated seeing her hurting, but I\u2019ve only ever stated this when it\u2019s been asked of me. At this point though I know I probably should\u2019ve just left it alone.", "My uncle cheated on my mom's sister from day one. This was back in the 60's. She finally found out about one when he got hit for child support.  They tried to work it out.  The following year he walked out on Christmas morning to be with his girlfriend and newborn. Or should I say new girlfriend.", "ESH -Except for OP\n\nYour sister is delusional thinking that she can find happiness with the guy who she parted with, then got back together with, then was cheated on by. \n\nYour mother is delusional thinking the same, even knowing about the cheating. Another commenter\u2019s post about the Holy Trousers seems to be on point. \n\nAnd the father is the AH for engaging in an affair before calling it quits with your sister. \n\n\u201cFor the sake of the kids\u201d is never the road to go down. Children learn the most about how relationships work from growing up around their parents, and are for more perceptive to what they try to hide from them than the parents realise. Having amicably separated parents is a lesser detriment to being brought up in a loveless housemate dynamic.", "NTA he\u2019s the one that ruined the family and continued to do so he was never going to stop cheating only get better at hiding it or it get to a point where your sister would pretend it didn\u2019t happen. This in no way would be good for the kids. They\u2019d either way see an unhealthy relationship and that\u2019s their first example on how relationships work. Your mom is definitely tripping. You are not a home wrecker in any way. You looked out for your sister and nephews/nieces. Maybe it\u2019s because she\u2019s older but they were never going to work it out", "NTA. Vicky wants to be with a man that cheated on her, is interested in other people, and has admitted that he doesn\u2019t want to be with her ? That\u2019s incredibly unhealthy for everyone involved. \nYou absolutely did the right thing, as did he-this time.", "You told the truth, and that\u2019s sometimes hard to accept.   \nHe seems to want what\u2019s best for his kids, while screwing around. That marriage was never going last.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nIs \"Cheaters\" still doing new episodes?\n\nYou go to rip that band-aid off.", "NTA but are you sure that you want to be closer to *this* family for your kid? You'll get the same treatment if you have relationship issues. Lots of internalised misogyny from your mum and sister here.", "NTA, but I feel really sorry for your sister.  Says he is trying to work it out,  but is going on days... he is a prick", "NTA, he asked for your advice because he clearly knew you\u2019d be honest. It\u2019s never healthy to stay with someone just for the child(ren).", "NTA\n\nIt would be more damaging for the kids to witness a loveless and toxic marriage. Its better for Joe to leave. Your sister might be hurt because its essentially a betrayal from Joe. Had they both stayed in that marriage, Joe is gonna continue cheating and it will hurt the kids.", "NTA. He came to you for advice and you gave good advice imo. I\u2019ve seen the kind of life they are headed in person and it\u2019s not pretty. Best friend growing up had parents that were slowly falling out of love. Wife refused to divorce for her kids sake. Husband started cheating with a coworker. By the time I was 16 the affair partner now stayed at their house half the time and actively had their relationship on display with wife turning to video games and never being with her husband at all. It was him cuddling affair partner while wife did wifely duties.", "NTA, I don\u2019t like Joes previous actions but it seems like for the first time he actually stepped up and did the right thing, even though it was hard. It\u2019s better for everyone that they have a clean break and move on.", "NTA. Sister deserves to be on dates like joe. She gets to be happy, and not happy to have a man. Question had you not seen Joe, would he have told sister about date. It\u2019s tough telling the truth, it\u2019s easy to lie.", "good god, have you never heard of paragraphs??? Too dense, didn't read.", "NTA. My husband's friend has two kids with his ex. They broke up because he cheated but kept \"trying to work things out\". The bottom line was he didn't love her and didn't want to be with her. He treated her terribly because he wasn't honest enough to end it or committed enough to stay faithful. In the end he fell hard for someone who wouldn't touch him with a barge pole while he was mucking his ex around and he ended it. I saw her recently (it's been 10 years), she looks so much happier than she ever did chasing after him.", "NTA\n\nThe only other advice you could have given was to be honest and go for an open relationship but even that wouldn\u2019t be great advice because both people have to want it", "NTA\n\nIf they had been back together, he would have probably cheated on her again", "It's maddening how some parents don't realize is how selfish they are when they're staying for the kids only (especially when their relationship or marriage is so dysfunctional) and how it fucks the kids up and their perception of love and relationships.", "Where I am from we call it the Cult of Holy Trousers (reference to times when only men could wear them). The cultists are (always) women who think that if a woman was lucky enough to catch a man in a marriage/stable relationships she needs to hold on to him no matter what and to do literally anything to preserve the marriage.\n\nIt might be hard to spot at first since many modern cultists lack most textbook sexist traits, as in: they are fully onboard with women working, having their own money, hobbies, friends, whatever, basically you can be as independent as you want as long as you have The Trousers at home. Like yes, a woman living in a house she owns with a masters degree and good income needs to be kind and patient with her jobless abusive alcoholic of a partner because Holy Trousers. A little cheating is basically nothing, just close your eyes and look away to not lose your Trousers. \n\nSeems like your mother is a cultist and preaches to your sister. You did a good thing for everyone involved, including kids, because children never need angry hurt estranged adults playing a family for them.", "He's a serial cheater, and probably a sex addict...honestly, he needs therapy, but that's going to work just when he's willing to do it. Your sister is going to be better without him, someday she'll go to appreciate what you did.", "That is all things considered a shockingly mature thing of him to do. I feel really bad for your sister in all of this, but ultimately you did the right thing, and actually eventually so did Joe. If it means he can actually be in his child\u2019s life then everything considered this is a good thing. Your advice was very reasonable and considered and the right thing has happened.", "NTA.  I have a college roommate whose parents were like your sister and BIL.  They weren't happy together but stayed married for their kids' sake.  When my roommate went to college her parents asked her and her sister if they were alright with them divorcing.  My roommate and her sister had almost the exact same response, \"It's about damn time.  We knew you were unhappy and felt you should have divorced a long time ago.  We felt like it was *our* fault you stayed together and unhappy for so long.\"\n\nThe kids will know their parents are unhappy and may blame themselves.  Your sister and BIL shouldn't put that type of burden on their kids.", "YTA\n\nIt doesn't matter that you gave reasonable advice, it wasn't your place to give it.", "I know this is controversial but ESH. Your advice was sound but it was an asshole move to give it to your sisters husband when you know full well that isn't what she wanted. Essentially you've acted like a neutral when you should have had your sister's back. Having her back means supporting her choices not railroading her into doing what you think is best. The husband is obviously a cheating AH and your sister is an AH for not standing up for herself.... but that's her choice not yours.", "NTA\n\nDid your mom and dad ever have marriage problems? I can't understand why she would act that way either, unless she maybe lived through it herself. \nNo man could do wrong in my mom's eyes... She was taught that way. Anything they wanted, we (any woman or girl) were supposed to get up and get.", "NTA. \n\nYou also can\u2019t rule out the possibility that Joe had an inkling of what advice you\u2019d give and wanted \u201cpermission\u201d to end things with Vicky. He\u2019s probably felt pressured by your parents and Vicky to make it work when he doesn\u2019t really want to, so you probably gave him the out he was looking for.", "NTA for that but YTA for not using paragraphs", "NTA. If your sister is willing to be some guy's doormat all her life, she won't have trouble finding a replacement who will cheat and lie to her. If she wants to be a better role model for her kids, she should be thanking you.\n\nAlso, you did not destroy that family. The cheating AH of a husband did. And the spineless wife who would raise her kids in a toxic household rather than accept the reality and work with the new situation to make sure they get what they need going forward.", "NTA. What a gross and sad situation to be in, hope you\u2019re doing ok", "NTA\u2026but I kindf understand your sisters position..she is a single mom now and it\u2019s pretty daunting position to be in and just coz he\u2019s cheated doesn\u2019t mean her love evaporated immediately. It\u2019s an emotional time and she\u2019s lashing out at people. \n\nI think usually when people ask for support or advice in these situations they usually want you to just listen to them\u2026it\u2019s too fresh for her now but with time she\u2019ll realise she\u2019s much better off without him especially when he was still cheating on her.", "NTA.  He was obviously not really committed to her.  Divorce sucks and all but a marriage based on lies and cheating seems worse to me.  Obviously it is not my decision nor yours but it doesn't seems to have been working even for him if he was going on \"dates\" so seems better it end faster rather than slower so your  sister can build a life for herself.", "You didn\u2019t wreck the marriage you told him to do the right thing for the kids. NTA", "NTA a man will be where he wants to be\n\nYou couldn\u00b4t make him stay and neither could Vicki, it is sad for her but nobody wrecked her home but Joe", "NTA.\n\nYour mother clearly doesn't understand what the term 'homewreaker\" is. Does she have a secret about saving her marriage in the past? Would she have preferred you to NOT tell your sister about what you saw or refuse to have anything to do with her husband when he called?\n\nDespite the cheating (an unforgivable thing in my eyes in regards to relationships unless very bizarre circumstances I cannot fathom yet), her husband is human and had the decency to be honest to some degree that the marriage is not working and wants what's best for the kids which, in my experience, is to not force 2 parents together that can't work for the sake of the kids.\n\n Your sister and mother are more worried about what society will say and about themselves than what is actually better for the kids who will likely thrive the sooner some stability in the relationship is formed in regards of custody and scheduling than promoting a clearly unhappy side of the husband and the constant mistrusts of the sister in the future. Sister needs to get a grip and move on with her life, not lash herself to a sinking ship of a marriage whilst her husband shoots more holes in the hull", "NTA but this type of advice never ends well for the one giving it even when it\u2019s good advice. Scape goat.", "NTA your sister needed out of that relationship, she deserves better. But Y A H for not realising he used you, he put the blame on you and walk out scott free. Now you're the evil sister and he gets to keep playing your sister", "The emotional yo-yoing is not good for the children. Your sister and mother are zeroing in on you because they aren't afraid of loosing you. Why your mother is looking past this is beyond me. \n\nJoe is the homewrecker not you. \nNTA", "NTA You absolutely did the right thing but it\u2019s easier for your sister to blame you than accept Joe never really wanted her. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re having to deal with this backlash and how your family will eventually come around. You gave the ultimatum that your sister should have had the backbone to give.", "I can understand that your sister is feeling heartbroken and is using you as the outlet for that because it\u2019s easier than admitting that he doesn\u2019t love her and it won\u2019t work in the long run because of that.\n\n\nAs for your mother having the opinion that you\u2019re a homewrecker, I\u2019ve found that (particularly women) of the older generation are much more tolerant of cheating and much more in favour of \u2018making it work\u2019 (aka overlooking cheating) for the sake of the kids. My mother is exactly the same and it makes me really angry whenever we discuss anything to do with this. If you can be bothered to argue with her then go ahead but she\u2019s unlikely to change her opinion after so long and it being so ingrained in her.", "NTA, you answered with what you think was right, didn\u2019t put your principles away to please someone else. You are NOT the home wrecker, Joe is.", "NTA.  You did your sister a favor she doesn\u2019t see it now.  What is the example she is setting for her kids about self worth and acceptance less than what they deserve from a partner.  Your mom sees like a lost cause.", "Woah. NTA. Their reactions are very immature. They may get a pass due to the level of emotion involved but quite frankly I would\u2019ve done the same even if I knew the consequence might be that my sister might never speak to me again.

I\u2019m not sure they\u2019ll see it was doomed to fail and it wasn\u2019t your fault. Also I think he\u2019s manipulative and used your advise as the reason to end up so there is someone other than him to blame.", "your mother does not know what a homewrecker is and your sister needs therapy if she believes a two time cheater is the best she can do.

It's one thing to stay together for the kids, it's entirely another to try and get *back* together for the kids. Joe clearly has moved on from your sister, and if she keeps trying to hang on to him then she also prevents herself from finding someone new", "NTA. The only homewrecker here is the serial cheater. You did your sister a favor by giving her ex that advice. Now she can move on and find someone better. \u201cDoing it for the kids\u201d is honestly one of the worst reasons to stay together. My parents divorced when I was 2 and they\u2019re happily living their own lives, which is much better than if they\u2019d stayed together and let their resentments fester.", "NTA but what did you think was going to happen? Did you think she'd thank you when she's only ever indicated she wanted to try to save the relationship? Now obviously you weren't wrong but that's not going to change her feelings about it, she probably feels betrayed by you hopefully with time she will get a better perspective. \n\nThe biggest asshole here is her husband who is a cheater and never should have come to you for advice about this in the first place.", "NTA. You, your boyfriend, and surprisingly Joe are focusing more on the kids in this situation. Their happiness is currently more important than their parents working it out for the sake of them. Growing up in an environment of toxic love is not healthy for them.", "NTA, it is easier to blame you than accept the blame is on her husband.  You didn't wreck their marriage. Joe did. Remind her you didn't cheat. \n\nI'm not sure giving that advice was the wisest choice, telling him to end the marriage is something that, if he acts upon, will get you blowback.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn\u2019t realize it right now, but you did the right thing and you did her a favor.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t care about her, but someone else will and they will treat her the way she deserves and they will be happy to coparent with both of them. \n\nShe will come around. You didn\u2019t cause that pain, the wrong man did. This is the start of her healing process, and she will understand what you did in time.\n\nHang in there, OP", "NTA - Yikes, thorny issue.  You did what you thought was right, but it was hard and it is going to have reverberations for you and your sister for years to come.  \n\nIn time your sister may realize this was the best thing possible for everyone, then again she might not.  Only time will tell.\n\nHowever, this is an important lesson for you, was damaging your relationship with your sister worth it?  Only you can answer that question.", "I would also add that I think he called OP because he was already leaning towards ending things because he has to know how OP feels about the relationship...he wanted someone that was going to be honest and tell him what he already knew...the relationship is broken beyond repair\n\nHe knows OP wants what is best for their sister and that they won't spare his feelings in order to ensure sis and kids get the future they deserve\n\nOP sis is upset now but soon she will realize that thanks to you she now has the opportunity to be TRULY happy - she was never going to get what she needs from the ex and it's only hurting her and the kids...the door needed to close can open up to the possibility of a new partner that won't cheat on her and will respect her and love her", "Technically-but-not-truly boomer-era here. That \"stay together for the kids\" stuff is the worst kind of bs.", "NTA OP. Also though, about the mom, my mom is like that but it\u2019s not just sexism. She just always assumes her children are wrong. Any time there is any kind of conflict, she always sides with the other person because it must be that I did something wrong coz that\u2019s how I am. It\u2019s been the same always. I am 40 and don\u2019t give a shit about it anymore but it\u2019s very hurtful and confusing. It\u2019s a sign of low self esteem, that\u2019s what my therapist told me.", "My stepbrother apparently in his teens just stood up and screamed at his parents why don't they fucking divorce after years of bickering and hating each other just staying together for his sake until he was at least at university. It opened their eyes that they had dragged him along their misery for years and he got a horrible experience of what a relationship was supposed to be like. They soon split up afterwards for his sake as he couldn't stand being in the same room as them", "[removed]", "Don\u2019t give your mom an out because of her generation. My mom is in her 70s and grew up in the Bible Belt and would never treat me the way your mom treats you and your sister.", "People you do realize that you don't have to be a man to harbor misogyny? And many times mothers nurture their boys like that. There are a lot of cases where mothers are jealous of their daughters, they compete (in their mind) with them for their husband 's love. They hate the fact that the new \"female\" gets all the attention (the \"now you are a mother, get serious, stop having fun or dressing sexy \" contributes to that). I remember a story of a friend telling me her grandma never told her mother that she was pretty or cute and when her mother gave birth to her (my friend) her grandma told her \"now is your turn\". I mean.... These people are not babysitting material", "If you\u2019re pregnant now, your mum can\u2019t be THAT old. Womens lib was fought in the 70s! This sexism has nothing to do with her generation!", "THIS is truly the fucking point. NTA, OP. but sis deep down understands, that's why she's unloading on OP and not hubby. relationship with OP is safer and stronger and can withstand it better. but OP did not create this situation. and OP can't actually grow ideas in hubby's mind that weren't already seeded there to begin with.", "I don't think you did anything wrong, but sometimes manipulate AH take advantage of others' good qualities, like honesty and your love for your sister. I think this is such a case.", "I was brought up like that, and got trapped with a mooch for 5 years. I do not blame my parents, I blame my whole culture.", "If I got pregnant now, I\u2019d be younger than my mom was when I was born, and she\u2019ll be 78 this summer."]}
