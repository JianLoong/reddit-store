Last year, Vicky found out Joe had been cheating on her with a coworker. When Vicky discovered Joe was cheating, she was 8 months pregnant, and she took herself and her daughter halfway across the country to stay with our parents. A few months after this, Joe moved out to the same state and got his own place in an effort to try and keep the family together. My parents were very supportive of them trying to work things out for the sake of the children. Things seemed to be going well, Vicky and the kids would go stay with Joe on his days off. When I was asked for advice from Vicky, I would always advise her with caution because I have/had no trust or respect for Joe after what he did. This was always met with anger from my sister and I eventually gave up trying to reason with her.\nAbout two months ago, my boyfriend (25M) and I also moved to the state my family resides in as I\u2019m currently 6 months pregnant with my first child and wanted to be closer to my family. A week ago, my boyfriend and I went out to dinner and we saw Joe with another woman. I took photos and sent them to Vicky, telling her that I do not know what the context is, it definitely looks like a date. When Vicky confronted Joe, he was honest and told her she was a girl he\u2019d met and taken interest in and that it was a date. Vicky was hurt and begged him to still continue trying to work things out with her, to which he agreed and supposedly cut off communication with the girl.\nNow where I may the AH, a couple days after this Joe called me to apologize for what I saw and the position he put me in, and also asked me what I thought he should do. He was on speaker, and my boyfriend and I both had a conversation with him where we pretty much advised him that if he didn\u2019t truly want to be in a relationship with Vicky then he needed to let her go. Joe said his reasoning for trying was for the kids\u2019 sake, and we told him that watching their parents go through this back and forth is going to hurt them more than help them in the end. That same night, Joe called Vicky and told her he didn\u2019t want to hurt her anymore and that he was not going to try for a relationship with her, only his kids. I\u2019m sure he told Vicky about our conversation, because she has been blowing up my phone telling me that I ruined her chance at happiness, that I destroyed her family, and that I should\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself. My mother has also been sending me messages telling me that I\u2019m a \u201chomewrecker\u201d and that I should\u2019ve just let them work things out instead of ruining two innocent kids\u2019 lives and family. \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1686290946, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144x1ll/aita_for_ruining_my_sisters_family/", "score": 48, "replies": ["ESH. I understand why you gave the advice you did, but this was a time when you probably should have told him to see a therapist and not gotten involved. Nothing good was ever going to come from advising him to end the marriage when you knew your sister didn\u2019t want that. Ultimately it was absolutely none of your business, and I find it really strange that he went to you for advice, honestly.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Ultimately you did you sister a huge favor if she had gotten married to him regardless if she had more kids she would\u2019ve only suffered more she would\u2019ve become paranoid and her anxiety would be worse because she would never be able to trust him because he\u2019s proven that emotionally he doesn\u2019t care about her. It may take awhile but your sister will realize how much you helped her as well as realize she deserves so much more than what joe gave her. Also I\u2019m sorry about your mom maybe go low contact if you can.", "NTA. He asked for your opinion and was mad because you gave it? He is a grown man and should take responsibility of his actions. No matter the advice you gave him whether good or bad (it was good imo) HE took the decision to take your advice which makes HIM and only HIM responsible for the outcome.", "NTA. He sought out your advice and you gave him a reasonable answer, and the right one imo. You didn\u2019t randomly call him up and tell him to leave your sister alone, you told him to not continue fucking with whatever stability she and the kids are trying to maintain if he didn\u2019t really love her. Your sister is in pain, but hopefully she will come around and realize you are not in any way the reason her family is not together. Your parents are wild for their reaction, but maybe it\u2019s just boomer-era \u2018stay together for the kids\u2019 stuff. Either way, this is on Joe and not you. Give it time.", "NTA\n\nYou are right.  You experienced what it was like to see parents make up and separate, often. It is possibly where you sister learned this behavior was acceptable.\n\nYour sister is hurt and angry, and you are the easy target because Joe talked with YOU.\n\nShe will be better off in the future, but it will take time to establish herself, and learn to coparent with Joe.", "YTA. Stay in your lane. You should have told him that it was between him and Vicky to sort out. \n\nSounds like you couldn\u2019t get Vicky to give up on him so when presented with an opportunity to approach it from the other side, you took it. \n\nNote: I don\u2019t think your opinion is WRONG. I think that is the inevitable option. But much better to support your sister instead of driving for the goal that YOU want, when YOU are ready. You obviously care a lot about her but I don\u2019t agree with your approach here.", "NTA. He asked for your opinion and you gave it to him. What he decided to do about it was on him, not you. \n\nYour sister and her kids deserve to be with someone that wants to be with them because he truly enjoys them and their company. Not because he just thinks he needs to be there because of the kids. There is a reason why he keeps going out with other women - he is not happy with your sister. It's so much better that they go their separate ways now so that they can go out and find their person. If not, it will be a vicious circle of him cheating, her finding out and blaming herself and trying to change who she is so that he will want her, him lying and telling her it'll never happen again, things will be good for a bit, then it starts all over again.", "NTA, you did not wreck her marriage.  Thankfully she did not end up pregnant again. Thankfully he did walk out on his family because his side thing was pregnant or had his kid. Lucky, she did not end up with a STD. How many other side things or hook-ups did he have over their relationship.", "NTA  \nJoe seems relentlessly self-centred and his effect on your whole family is destructive. Both your delusional mother and deeply hurt sister will realise this one day.", "I don't think you can ruin a family that wasn't really one in the first place. AND, YTA here. You crossed a boundary. I understand why you did it, but it was still a poor choice. You basically decided to insert yourself into their relationship. Just because he asked for your thoughts about what to do doesn't mean it was appropriate for you to give them, and once you did, he could then abdicate his own responsibility for the demise of their relationship to you. Well played on his part.", "NTA - anybody would give that same piece of advice. \n\nBeing in a relationship \u201cfor the kids\u201d isn\u2019t going to help either party be their best version of themselves as a parent, and not to mention, Vicky shouldn\u2019t be nor want to be in a relationship with someone who clearly doesn\u2019t want to be in a relationship with her.", "NTA - Poor Vicky but it really sounds like it is for the best. Her expectations and self respect is probably at an all time low because of this guy and she thinks the best she deserves is some cheater. But she is wrong, and if she can get past the pain and victimhood I'm sure there are plenty great people who will be interested.", "NTA you should move closer to your boyfriends family and get away from your toxic relatives", "He had called to apologize for what I saw at the restaurant and also to tell me he wasn\u2019t mad at me for telling my sister, although I wouldn\u2019t have cared if he was because that was something I still don\u2019t think i should have kept to myself. I do realize now that as far as giving him any input, I should\u2019ve just stayed out of it. But as far as asking for the advice, that was mostly geared towards my boyfriend who was in the room with me when he called, but we had the same opinion and we both shared with him our thoughts. My boyfriend is a few years older than me, so closer in age to Joe and also a guy, and before the cheating they had gotten along very well when we had visited them for a few weeks over a year ago.", "I haven\u2019t understood my mother\u2019s position this entire time. She\u2019s been extremely supportive of them working things out regardless of the cheating and his overall push and pull attitude with my sister since everything blew up. She\u2019s kinda always been borderline sexist (imo) when it comes to men my sister and I have dated. Any disagreement i\u2019ve had with my current boyfriend or any ex boyfriends she\u2019s always taken the guy\u2019s side, even when he\u2019s been dead wrong and she\u2019s been the same with my sister. I\u2019ve never understood why she\u2019s like this, but yea I guess it could simply boil down to her generation and the time she grew up in.", "When I was in high school, I dated Joe\u2019s cousin. He\u2019d told me that during the beginning of their relationship Joe cheated on my sister repeatedly. I did tell her about this, but when she confronted Joe he adamantly denied it. I will likely never know if that was true or not but I would put money on the fact that it probably is true, and it was probably throughout their relationship too. But like i said, i\u2019ll never know or be able to prove it.", "Yeah, my boyfriend suggested that he likely knew my feelings already and wanted to end the relationship anyways, but decided to manipulate the situation to seem like I made him do this. I do think I should\u2019ve just ignored his call after all that\u2019s happened. Yes, I wanted her to leave him because I know she deserves better and I hated seeing her hurting, but I\u2019ve only ever stated this when it\u2019s been asked of me. At this point though I know I probably should\u2019ve just left it alone.", "My uncle cheated on my mom's sister from day one. This was back in the 60's. She finally found out about one when he got hit for child support.  They tried to work it out.  The following year he walked out on Christmas morning to be with his girlfriend and newborn. Or should I say new girlfriend."]}
