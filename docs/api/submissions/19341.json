My parents were very supportive of them trying to work things out for the sake of the children. Things seemed to be going well, Vicky and the kids would go stay with Joe on his days off.

A week ago, my boyfriend and I went out to dinner and we saw Joe with another woman. I took photos and sent them to Vicky, telling her that I do not know what the context is, it definitely looks like a date. When Vicky confronted Joe, he was honest and told her she was a girl he\u2019d met and taken interest in and that it was a date. Vicky was hurt and begged him to still continue trying to work things out with her, to which he agreed and supposedly cut off communication with the girl.\nNow where I may the AH, a couple days after this Joe called me to apologize for what I saw and the position he put me in, and also asked me what I thought he should do. He was on speaker, and my boyfriend and I both had a conversation with him where we pretty much advised him that if he didn\u2019t truly want to be in a relationship with Vicky then he needed to let her go. Joe said his reasoning for trying was for the kids\u2019 sake, and we told him that watching their parents go through this back and forth is going to hurt them more than help them in the end. That same night, Joe called Vicky and told her he didn\u2019t want to hurt her anymore and that he was not going to try for a relationship with her, only his kids. I\u2019m sure he told Vicky about our conversation, because she has been blowing up my phone telling me that I ruined her chance at happiness, that I destroyed her family, and that I should\u2019ve kept my opinions to myself. My mother has also been sending me messages telling me that I\u2019m a \u201chomewrecker\u201d and that I should\u2019ve just let them work things out instead of ruining two innocent kids\u2019 lives and family. \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1686290946, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144x1ll/aita_for_ruining_my_sisters_family/", "score": 322, "replies": ["ESH. I understand why you gave the advice you did, but this was a time when you probably should have told him to see a therapist and not gotten involved. Nothing good was ever going to come from advising him to end the marriage when you knew your sister didn\u2019t want that. Ultimately it was absolutely none of your business, and I find it really strange that he went to you for advice, honestly.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA people are saying you should\u2019ve stayed in your 'lane' but joe literally asked for your opinion and your sister already knew what it was so how could you. Ultimately you did you sister a huge favor if she had gotten married to him regardless if she had more kids she would\u2019ve only suffered more she would\u2019ve become paranoid and her anxiety would be worse because she would never be able to trust him because he\u2019s proven that emotionally he doesn\u2019t care about her. It may take awhile but your sister will realize how much you helped her as well as realize she deserves so much more than what joe gave her. Also I\u2019m sorry about your mom maybe go low contact if you can.", "NTA. He asked for your opinion and was mad because you gave it? He is a grown man and should take responsibility of his actions. No matter the advice you gave him whether good or bad (it was good imo) HE took the decision to take your advice which makes HIM and only HIM responsible for the outcome.", "NTA. He sought out your advice and you gave him a reasonable answer, and the right one imo. You didn\u2019t randomly call him up and tell him to leave your sister alone, you told him to not continue fucking with whatever stability she and the kids are trying to maintain if he didn\u2019t really love her. Your sister is in pain, but hopefully she will come around and realize you are not in any way the reason her family is not together. Your parents are wild for their reaction, but maybe it\u2019s just boomer-era \u2018stay together for the kids\u2019 stuff. Either way, this is on Joe and not you. Give it time.", "NTA\n\nYou are right.  You experienced what it was like to see parents make up and separate, often. It is possibly where you sister learned this behavior was acceptable.\n\nYour sister is hurt and angry, and you are the easy target because Joe talked with YOU.\n\nShe will be better off in the future, but it will take time to establish herself, and learn to coparent with Joe.", "YTA. Stay in your lane. You should have told him that it was between him and Vicky to sort out. \n\nSounds like you couldn\u2019t get Vicky to give up on him so when presented with an opportunity to approach it from the other side, you took it. \n\nNote: I don\u2019t think your opinion is WRONG. I think that is the inevitable option. But much better to support your sister instead of driving for the goal that YOU want, when YOU are ready. You obviously care a lot about her but I don\u2019t agree with your approach here.", "NTA. He asked for your opinion and you gave it to him. What he decided to do about it was on him, not you. \n\nYour sister and her kids deserve to be with someone that wants to be with them because he truly enjoys them and their company. Not because he just thinks he needs to be there because of the kids. There is a reason why he keeps going out with other women - he is not happy with your sister. It's so much better that they go their separate ways now so that they can go out and find their person. If not, it will be a vicious circle of him cheating, her finding out and blaming herself and trying to change who she is so that he will want her, him lying and telling her it'll never happen again, things will be good for a bit, then it starts all over again.", "NTA, you did not wreck her marriage.  Thankfully she did not end up pregnant again. Thankfully he did walk out on his family because his side thing was pregnant or had his kid. Lucky, she did not end up with a STD. How many other side things or hook-ups did he have over their relationship.", "NTA  \nJoe seems relentlessly self-centred and his effect on your whole family is destructive. Both your delusional mother and deeply hurt sister will realise this one day.", "I don't think you can ruin a family that wasn't really one in the first place. AND, YTA here. You crossed a boundary. I understand why you did it, but it was still a poor choice. You basically decided to insert yourself into their relationship. Just because he asked for your thoughts about what to do doesn't mean it was appropriate for you to give them, and once you did, he could then abdicate his own responsibility for the demise of their relationship to you. Well played on his part.", "NTA - anybody would give that same piece of advice. \n\nBeing in a relationship \u201cfor the kids\u201d isn\u2019t going to help either party be their best version of themselves as a parent, and not to mention, Vicky shouldn\u2019t be nor want to be in a relationship with someone who clearly doesn\u2019t want to be in a relationship with her.", "NTA - Poor Vicky but it really sounds like it is for the best. Her expectations and self respect is probably at an all time low because of this guy and she thinks the best she deserves is some cheater. But she is wrong, and if she can get past the pain and victimhood I'm sure there are plenty great people who will be interested.", "NTA you should move closer to your boyfriends family and get away from your toxic relatives", "He had called to apologize for what I saw at the restaurant and also to tell me he wasn\u2019t mad at me for telling my sister, although I wouldn\u2019t have cared if he was because that was something I still don\u2019t think i should have kept to myself. I do realize now that as far as giving him any input, I should\u2019ve just stayed out of it. But as far as asking for the advice, that was mostly geared towards my boyfriend who was in the room with me when he called, but we had the same opinion and we both shared with him our thoughts. My boyfriend is a few years older than me, so closer in age to Joe and also a guy, and before the cheating they had gotten along very well when we had visited them for a few weeks over a year ago.", "I haven\u2019t understood my mother\u2019s position this entire time. She\u2019s been extremely supportive of them working things out regardless of the cheating and his overall push and pull attitude with my sister since everything blew up. She\u2019s kinda always been borderline sexist (imo) when it comes to men my sister and I have dated. Any disagreement i\u2019ve had with my current boyfriend or any ex boyfriends she\u2019s always taken the guy\u2019s side, even when he\u2019s been dead wrong and she\u2019s been the same with my sister. I\u2019ve never understood why she\u2019s like this, but yea I guess it could simply boil down to her generation and the time she grew up in.", "When I was in high school, I dated Joe\u2019s cousin. He\u2019d told me that during the beginning of their relationship Joe cheated on my sister repeatedly. I did tell her about this, but when she confronted Joe he adamantly denied it. I will likely never know if that was true or not but I would put money on the fact that it probably is true, and it was probably throughout their relationship too. But like i said, i\u2019ll never know or be able to prove it.", "Yeah, my boyfriend suggested that he likely knew my feelings already and wanted to end the relationship anyways, but decided to manipulate the situation to seem like I made him do this. I do think I should\u2019ve just ignored his call after all that\u2019s happened. Yes, I wanted her to leave him because I know she deserves better and I hated seeing her hurting, but I\u2019ve only ever stated this when it\u2019s been asked of me. At this point though I know I probably should\u2019ve just left it alone.", "My uncle cheated on my mom's sister from day one. This was back in the 60's. She finally found out about one when he got hit for child support.  They tried to work it out.  The following year he walked out on Christmas morning to be with his girlfriend and newborn. Or should I say new girlfriend.", "ESH -Except for OP\n\nYour sister is delusional thinking that she can find happiness with the guy who she parted with, then got back together with, then was cheated on by. \n\nYour mother is delusional thinking the same, even knowing about the cheating. Another commenter\u2019s post about the Holy Trousers seems to be on point. \n\nAnd the father is the AH for engaging in an affair before calling it quits with your sister. \n\n\u201cFor the sake of the kids\u201d is never the road to go down. Children learn the most about how relationships work from growing up around their parents, and are for more perceptive to what they try to hide from them than the parents realise. Having amicably separated parents is a lesser detriment to being brought up in a loveless housemate dynamic.", "NTA he\u2019s the one that ruined the family and continued to do so he was never going to stop cheating only get better at hiding it or it get to a point where your sister would pretend it didn\u2019t happen. This in no way would be good for the kids. They\u2019d either way see an unhealthy relationship and that\u2019s their first example on how relationships work. Your mom is definitely tripping. You are not a home wrecker in any way. You looked out for your sister and nephews/nieces. Maybe it\u2019s because she\u2019s older but they were never going to work it out", "NTA. Vicky wants to be with a man that cheated on her, is interested in other people, and has admitted that he doesn\u2019t want to be with her ? That\u2019s incredibly unhealthy for everyone involved. \nYou absolutely did the right thing, as did he-this time.", "You told the truth, and that\u2019s sometimes hard to accept.   \nHe seems to want what\u2019s best for his kids, while screwing around. That marriage was never going last.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nIs \"Cheaters\" still doing new episodes?\n\nYou go to rip that band-aid off.", "NTA but are you sure that you want to be closer to *this* family for your kid? You'll get the same treatment if you have relationship issues. Lots of internalised misogyny from your mum and sister here.", "NTA, but I feel really sorry for your sister.  Says he is trying to work it out,  but is going on days... he is a prick", "NTA, he asked for your advice because he clearly knew you\u2019d be honest. It\u2019s never healthy to stay with someone just for the child(ren).", "NTA\n\nIt would be more damaging for the kids to witness a loveless and toxic marriage. Its better for Joe to leave. Your sister might be hurt because its essentially a betrayal from Joe. Had they both stayed in that marriage, Joe is gonna continue cheating and it will hurt the kids.", "NTA. He came to you for advice and you gave good advice imo. I\u2019ve seen the kind of life they are headed in person and it\u2019s not pretty. Best friend growing up had parents that were slowly falling out of love. Wife refused to divorce for her kids sake. Husband started cheating with a coworker. By the time I was 16 the affair partner now stayed at their house half the time and actively had their relationship on display with wife turning to video games and never being with her husband at all. It was him cuddling affair partner while wife did wifely duties.", "NTA, I don\u2019t like Joes previous actions but it seems like for the first time he actually stepped up and did the right thing, even though it was hard. It\u2019s better for everyone that they have a clean break and move on.", "NTA. Sister deserves to be on dates like joe. She gets to be happy, and not happy to have a man. Question had you not seen Joe, would he have told sister about date. It\u2019s tough telling the truth, it\u2019s easy to lie.", "good god, have you never heard of paragraphs??? Too dense, didn't read.", "NTA. My husband's friend has two kids with his ex. They broke up because he cheated but kept \"trying to work things out\". The bottom line was he didn't love her and didn't want to be with her. He treated her terribly because he wasn't honest enough to end it or committed enough to stay faithful. In the end he fell hard for someone who wouldn't touch him with a barge pole while he was mucking his ex around and he ended it. I saw her recently (it's been 10 years), she looks so much happier than she ever did chasing after him.", "NTA\n\nThe only other advice you could have given was to be honest and go for an open relationship but even that wouldn\u2019t be great advice because both people have to want it", "NTA\n\nIf they had been back together, he would have probably cheated on her again", "It's maddening how some parents don't realize is how selfish they are when they're staying for the kids only (especially when their relationship or marriage is so dysfunctional) and how it fucks the kids up and their perception of love and relationships.", "Where I am from we call it the Cult of Holy Trousers (reference to times when only men could wear them). The cultists are (always) women who think that if a woman was lucky enough to catch a man in a marriage/stable relationships she needs to hold on to him no matter what and to do literally anything to preserve the marriage.\n\nIt might be hard to spot at first since many modern cultists lack most textbook sexist traits, as in: they are fully onboard with women working, having their own money, hobbies, friends, whatever, basically you can be as independent as you want as long as you have The Trousers at home. Like yes, a woman living in a house she owns with a masters degree and good income needs to be kind and patient with her jobless abusive alcoholic of a partner because Holy Trousers. A little cheating is basically nothing, just close your eyes and look away to not lose your Trousers. \n\nSeems like your mother is a cultist and preaches to your sister. You did a good thing for everyone involved, including kids, because children never need angry hurt estranged adults playing a family for them.", "He's a serial cheater, and probably a sex addict...honestly, he needs therapy, but that's going to work just when he's willing to do it. Your sister is going to be better without him, someday she'll go to appreciate what you did.", "That is all things considered a shockingly mature thing of him to do. I feel really bad for your sister in all of this, but ultimately you did the right thing, and actually eventually so did Joe. If it means he can actually be in his child\u2019s life then everything considered this is a good thing. Your advice was very reasonable and considered and the right thing has happened."]}
