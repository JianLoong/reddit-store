This was always met with anger from my sister and I eventually gave up trying to reason with her.\nAbout two months ago, my boyfriend (25M) and I also moved to the state my family resides in as I\u2019m currently 6 months pregnant with my first child and wanted to be closer to my family. A week ago, my boyfriend and I went out to dinner and we saw Joe with another woman. I took photos and sent them to Vicky, telling her that I do not know what the context is, it definitely looks like a date. When Vicky confronted Joe, he was honest and told her she was a girl he\u2019d met and taken interest in and that it was a date. Vicky was hurt and begged him to still continue trying to work things out with her, to which he agreed and supposedly cut off communication with the girl.\nNow where I may the AH, a couple days after this Joe called me to apologize for what I saw and the position he put me in, and also asked me what I thought he should do. He was on speaker, and my boyfriend and I both had a conversation with him where we pretty much advised him that if he didn\u2019t truly want to be in a relationship with Vicky then he needed to let her go. Joe said his reasoning for trying was for the kids\u2019 sake, and we told him that watching their parents go through this back and forth is going to hurt them more than help them in the end. That same night, Joe called Vicky and told her he didn\u2019t want to hurt her anymore and that he was not going to try for a relationship with her, only his kids.

Ultimately you did you sister a huge favor if she had gotten married to him regardless if she had more kids she would\u2019ve only suffered more she would\u2019ve become paranoid and her anxiety would be worse because she would never be able to trust him because he\u2019s proven that emotionally he doesn\u2019t care about her. It may take awhile but your sister will realize how much you helped her as well as realize she deserves so much more than what joe gave her. Also I\u2019m sorry about your mom maybe go low contact if you can.", "NTA. He asked for your opinion and was mad because you gave it? He is a grown man and should take responsibility of his actions. No matter the advice you gave him whether good or bad (it was good imo) HE took the decision to take your advice which makes HIM and only HIM responsible for the outcome.", "NTA. He sought out your advice and you gave him a reasonable answer, and the right one imo. You didn\u2019t randomly call him up and tell him to leave your sister alone, you told him to not continue fucking with whatever stability she and the kids are trying to maintain if he didn\u2019t really love her. Your sister is in pain, but hopefully she will come around and realize you are not in any way the reason her family is not together. Your parents are wild for their reaction, but maybe it\u2019s just boomer-era \u2018stay together for the kids\u2019 stuff. Either way, this is on Joe and not you. Give it time.", "NTA\n\nYou are right.  You experienced what it was like to see parents make up and separate, often. It is possibly where you sister learned this behavior was acceptable.\n\nYour sister is hurt and angry, and you are the easy target because Joe talked with YOU.\n\nShe will be better off in the future, but it will take time to establish herself, and learn to coparent with Joe.", "YTA. Stay in your lane. You should have told him that it was between him and Vicky to sort out. \n\nSounds like you couldn\u2019t get Vicky to give up on him so when presented with an opportunity to approach it from the other side, you took it. \n\nNote: I don\u2019t think your opinion is WRONG. I think that is the inevitable option. But much better to support your sister instead of driving for the goal that YOU want, when YOU are ready. You obviously care a lot about her but I don\u2019t agree with your approach here.", "NTA. He asked for your opinion and you gave it to him. What he decided to do about it was on him, not you. \n\nYour sister and her kids deserve to be with someone that wants to be with them because he truly enjoys them and their company. Not because he just thinks he needs to be there because of the kids. There is a reason why he keeps going out with other women - he is not happy with your sister. It's so much better that they go their separate ways now so that they can go out and find their person. If not, it will be a vicious circle of him cheating, her finding out and blaming herself and trying to change who she is so that he will want her, him lying and telling her it'll never happen again, things will be good for a bit, then it starts all over again.", "NTA, you did not wreck her marriage.  Thankfully she did not end up pregnant again. Thankfully he did walk out on his family because his side thing was pregnant or had his kid. Lucky, she did not end up with a STD. How many other side things or hook-ups did he have over their relationship.", "NTA  \nJoe seems relentlessly self-centred and his effect on your whole family is destructive. Both your delusional mother and deeply hurt sister will realise this one day.", "I don't think you can ruin a family that wasn't really one in the first place. AND, YTA here. You crossed a boundary. I understand why you did it, but it was still a poor choice. You basically decided to insert yourself into their relationship. Just because he asked for your thoughts about what to do doesn't mean it was appropriate for you to give them, and once you did, he could then abdicate his own responsibility for the demise of their relationship to you. Well played on his part.", "NTA - anybody would give that same piece of advice. \n\nBeing in a relationship \u201cfor the kids\u201d isn\u2019t going to help either party be their best version of themselves as a parent, and not to mention, Vicky shouldn\u2019t be nor want to be in a relationship with someone who clearly doesn\u2019t want to be in a relationship with her.", "NTA - Poor Vicky but it really sounds like it is for the best. Her expectations and self respect is probably at an all time low because of this guy and she thinks the best she deserves is some cheater. But she is wrong, and if she can get past the pain and victimhood I'm sure there are plenty great people who will be interested.", "NTA you should move closer to your boyfriends family and get away from your toxic relatives", "He had called to apologize for what I saw at the restaurant and also to tell me he wasn\u2019t mad at me for telling my sister, although I wouldn\u2019t have cared if he was because that was something I still don\u2019t think i should have kept to myself. I do realize now that as far as giving him any input, I should\u2019ve just stayed out of it. But as far as asking for the advice, that was mostly geared towards my boyfriend who was in the room with me when he called, but we had the same opinion and we both shared with him our thoughts. My boyfriend is a few years older than me, so closer in age to Joe and also a guy, and before the cheating they had gotten along very well when we had visited them for a few weeks over a year ago.", "I haven\u2019t understood my mother\u2019s position this entire time. She\u2019s been extremely supportive of them working things out regardless of the cheating and his overall push and pull attitude with my sister since everything blew up. She\u2019s kinda always been borderline sexist (imo) when it comes to men my sister and I have dated. Any disagreement i\u2019ve had with my current boyfriend or any ex boyfriends she\u2019s always taken the guy\u2019s side, even when he\u2019s been dead wrong and she\u2019s been the same with my sister. I\u2019ve never understood why she\u2019s like this, but yea I guess it could simply boil down to her generation and the time she grew up in.", "When I was in high school, I dated Joe\u2019s cousin. He\u2019d told me that during the beginning of their relationship Joe cheated on my sister repeatedly. I did tell her about this, but when she confronted Joe he adamantly denied it. I will likely never know if that was true or not but I would put money on the fact that it probably is true, and it was probably throughout their relationship too. But like i said, i\u2019ll never know or be able to prove it.", "Yeah, my boyfriend suggested that he likely knew my feelings already and wanted to end the relationship anyways, but decided to manipulate the situation to seem like I made him do this. I do think I should\u2019ve just ignored his call after all that\u2019s happened. Yes, I wanted her to leave him because I know she deserves better and I hated seeing her hurting, but I\u2019ve only ever stated this when it\u2019s been asked of me. At this point though I know I probably should\u2019ve just left it alone.", "My uncle cheated on my mom's sister from day one. This was back in the 60's. She finally found out about one when he got hit for child support.  They tried to work it out.  The following year he walked out on Christmas morning to be with his girlfriend and newborn. Or should I say new girlfriend.", "ESH -Except for OP\n\nYour sister is delusional thinking that she can find happiness with the guy who she parted with, then got back together with, then was cheated on by. \n\nYour mother is delusional thinking the same, even knowing about the cheating. Another commenter\u2019s post about the Holy Trousers seems to be on point. \n\nAnd the father is the AH for engaging in an affair before calling it quits with your sister. \n\n\u201cFor the sake of the kids\u201d is never the road to go down. Children learn the most about how relationships work from growing up around their parents, and are for more perceptive to what they try to hide from them than the parents realise. Having amicably separated parents is a lesser detriment to being brought up in a loveless housemate dynamic.", "NTA he\u2019s the one that ruined the family and continued to do so he was never going to stop cheating only get better at hiding it or it get to a point where your sister would pretend it didn\u2019t happen. This in no way would be good for the kids. They\u2019d either way see an unhealthy relationship and that\u2019s their first example on how relationships work. Your mom is definitely tripping. You are not a home wrecker in any way. You looked out for your sister and nephews/nieces. Maybe it\u2019s because she\u2019s older but they were never going to work it out", "NTA. Vicky wants to be with a man that cheated on her, is interested in other people, and has admitted that he doesn\u2019t want to be with her ? That\u2019s incredibly unhealthy for everyone involved. \nYou absolutely did the right thing, as did he-this time.", "You told the truth, and that\u2019s sometimes hard to accept.   \nHe seems to want what\u2019s best for his kids, while screwing around. That marriage was never going last.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nIs \"Cheaters\" still doing new episodes?\n\nYou go to rip that band-aid off.", "NTA but are you sure that you want to be closer to *this* family for your kid? You'll get the same treatment if you have relationship issues. Lots of internalised misogyny from your mum and sister here.", "NTA, but I feel really sorry for your sister.  Says he is trying to work it out,  but is going on days... he is a prick", "NTA, he asked for your advice because he clearly knew you\u2019d be honest. It\u2019s never healthy to stay with someone just for the child(ren).", "NTA\n\nIt would be more damaging for the kids to witness a loveless and toxic marriage. Its better for Joe to leave. Your sister might be hurt because its essentially a betrayal from Joe. Had they both stayed in that marriage, Joe is gonna continue cheating and it will hurt the kids.", "NTA. He came to you for advice and you gave good advice imo. I\u2019ve seen the kind of life they are headed in person and it\u2019s not pretty. Best friend growing up had parents that were slowly falling out of love. Wife refused to divorce for her kids sake. Husband started cheating with a coworker. By the time I was 16 the affair partner now stayed at their house half the time and actively had their relationship on display with wife turning to video games and never being with her husband at all. It was him cuddling affair partner while wife did wifely duties.", "NTA, I don\u2019t like Joes previous actions but it seems like for the first time he actually stepped up and did the right thing, even though it was hard. It\u2019s better for everyone that they have a clean break and move on.", "NTA. Sister deserves to be on dates like joe. She gets to be happy, and not happy to have a man. Question had you not seen Joe, would he have told sister about date. It\u2019s tough telling the truth, it\u2019s easy to lie.", "good god, have you never heard of paragraphs??? Too dense, didn't read.", "NTA. My husband's friend has two kids with his ex. They broke up because he cheated but kept \"trying to work things out\". The bottom line was he didn't love her and didn't want to be with her. He treated her terribly because he wasn't honest enough to end it or committed enough to stay faithful. In the end he fell hard for someone who wouldn't touch him with a barge pole while he was mucking his ex around and he ended it. I saw her recently (it's been 10 years), she looks so much happier than she ever did chasing after him.", "NTA\n\nThe only other advice you could have given was to be honest and go for an open relationship but even that wouldn\u2019t be great advice because both people have to want it", "NTA\n\nIf they had been back together, he would have probably cheated on her again", "It's maddening how some parents don't realize is how selfish they are when they're staying for the kids only (especially when their relationship or marriage is so dysfunctional) and how it fucks the kids up and their perception of love and relationships.", "Where I am from we call it the Cult of Holy Trousers (reference to times when only men could wear them). The cultists are (always) women who think that if a woman was lucky enough to catch a man in a marriage/stable relationships she needs to hold on to him no matter what and to do literally anything to preserve the marriage.\n\nIt might be hard to spot at first since many modern cultists lack most textbook sexist traits, as in: they are fully onboard with women working, having their own money, hobbies, friends, whatever, basically you can be as independent as you want as long as you have The Trousers at home. Like yes, a woman living in a house she owns with a masters degree and good income needs to be kind and patient with her jobless abusive alcoholic of a partner because Holy Trousers. A little cheating is basically nothing, just close your eyes and look away to not lose your Trousers. \n\nSeems like your mother is a cultist and preaches to your sister. You did a good thing for everyone involved, including kids, because children never need angry hurt estranged adults playing a family for them.", "He's a serial cheater, and probably a sex addict...honestly, he needs therapy, but that's going to work just when he's willing to do it. Your sister is going to be better without him, someday she'll go to appreciate what you did.", "That is all things considered a shockingly mature thing of him to do. I feel really bad for your sister in all of this, but ultimately you did the right thing, and actually eventually so did Joe. If it means he can actually be in his child\u2019s life then everything considered this is a good thing. Your advice was very reasonable and considered and the right thing has happened.", "NTA.  I have a college roommate whose parents were like your sister and BIL.  They weren't happy together but stayed married for their kids' sake.  When my roommate went to college her parents asked her and her sister if they were alright with them divorcing.  My roommate and her sister had almost the exact same response, \"It's about damn time.  We knew you were unhappy and felt you should have divorced a long time ago.  We felt like it was *our* fault you stayed together and unhappy for so long.\"\n\nThe kids will know their parents are unhappy and may blame themselves.  Your sister and BIL shouldn't put that type of burden on their kids.", "YTA\n\nIt doesn't matter that you gave reasonable advice, it wasn't your place to give it.", "I know this is controversial but ESH. Your advice was sound but it was an asshole move to give it to your sisters husband when you know full well that isn't what she wanted. Essentially you've acted like a neutral when you should have had your sister's back. Having her back means supporting her choices not railroading her into doing what you think is best. The husband is obviously a cheating AH and your sister is an AH for not standing up for herself.... but that's her choice not yours.", "NTA\n\nDid your mom and dad ever have marriage problems? I can't understand why she would act that way either, unless she maybe lived through it herself. \nNo man could do wrong in my mom's eyes... She was taught that way. Anything they wanted, we (any woman or girl) were supposed to get up and get.", "NTA. \n\nYou also can\u2019t rule out the possibility that Joe had an inkling of what advice you\u2019d give and wanted \u201cpermission\u201d to end things with Vicky. He\u2019s probably felt pressured by your parents and Vicky to make it work when he doesn\u2019t really want to, so you probably gave him the out he was looking for.", "NTA for that but YTA for not using paragraphs", "NTA. If your sister is willing to be some guy's doormat all her life, she won't have trouble finding a replacement who will cheat and lie to her. If she wants to be a better role model for her kids, she should be thanking you.\n\nAlso, you did not destroy that family. The cheating AH of a husband did. And the spineless wife who would raise her kids in a toxic household rather than accept the reality and work with the new situation to make sure they get what they need going forward.", "NTA. What a gross and sad situation to be in, hope you\u2019re doing ok", "NTA\u2026but I kindf understand your sisters position..she is a single mom now and it\u2019s pretty daunting position to be in and just coz he\u2019s cheated doesn\u2019t mean her love evaporated immediately. It\u2019s an emotional time and she\u2019s lashing out at people. \n\nI think usually when people ask for support or advice in these situations they usually want you to just listen to them\u2026it\u2019s too fresh for her now but with time she\u2019ll realise she\u2019s much better off without him especially when he was still cheating on her.", "NTA.  He was obviously not really committed to her.  Divorce sucks and all but a marriage based on lies and cheating seems worse to me.  Obviously it is not my decision nor yours but it doesn't seems to have been working even for him if he was going on \"dates\" so seems better it end faster rather than slower so your  sister can build a life for herself.", "You didn\u2019t wreck the marriage you told him to do the right thing for the kids. NTA", "NTA a man will be where he wants to be\n\nYou couldn\u00b4t make him stay and neither could Vicki, it is sad for her but nobody wrecked her home but Joe", "NTA.\n\nYour mother clearly doesn't understand what the term 'homewreaker\" is. Does she have a secret about saving her marriage in the past? Would she have preferred you to NOT tell your sister about what you saw or refuse to have anything to do with her husband when he called?\n\nDespite the cheating (an unforgivable thing in my eyes in regards to relationships unless very bizarre circumstances I cannot fathom yet), her husband is human and had the decency to be honest to some degree that the marriage is not working and wants what's best for the kids which, in my experience, is to not force 2 parents together that can't work for the sake of the kids.\n\n Your sister and mother are more worried about what society will say and about themselves than what is actually better for the kids who will likely thrive the sooner some stability in the relationship is formed in regards of custody and scheduling than promoting a clearly unhappy side of the husband and the constant mistrusts of the sister in the future. Sister needs to get a grip and move on with her life, not lash herself to a sinking ship of a marriage whilst her husband shoots more holes in the hull", "NTA but this type of advice never ends well for the one giving it even when it\u2019s good advice. Scape goat.", "NTA your sister needed out of that relationship, she deserves better. But Y A H for not realising he used you, he put the blame on you and walk out scott free. Now you're the evil sister and he gets to keep playing your sister", "The emotional yo-yoing is not good for the children. Your sister and mother are zeroing in on you because they aren't afraid of loosing you. Why your mother is looking past this is beyond me. \n\nJoe is the homewrecker not you. \nNTA", "NTA You absolutely did the right thing but it\u2019s easier for your sister to blame you than accept Joe never really wanted her. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re having to deal with this backlash and how your family will eventually come around. You gave the ultimatum that your sister should have had the backbone to give.", "I can understand that your sister is feeling heartbroken and is using you as the outlet for that because it\u2019s easier than admitting that he doesn\u2019t love her and it won\u2019t work in the long run because of that.\n\n\nAs for your mother having the opinion that you\u2019re a homewrecker, I\u2019ve found that (particularly women) of the older generation are much more tolerant of cheating and much more in favour of \u2018making it work\u2019 (aka overlooking cheating) for the sake of the kids. My mother is exactly the same and it makes me really angry whenever we discuss anything to do with this. If you can be bothered to argue with her then go ahead but she\u2019s unlikely to change her opinion after so long and it being so ingrained in her.", "NTA, you answered with what you think was right, didn\u2019t put your principles away to please someone else. You are NOT the home wrecker, Joe is.", "NTA.  You did your sister a favor she doesn\u2019t see it now.  What is the example she is setting for her kids about self worth and acceptance less than what they deserve from a partner.  Your mom sees like a lost cause.", "Woah. NTA. Their reactions are very immature. They may get a pass due to the level of emotion involved but quite frankly I would\u2019ve done the same even if I knew the consequence might be that my sister might never speak to me again.

I\u2019m not sure they\u2019ll see it was doomed to fail and it wasn\u2019t your fault.

It's one thing to stay together for the kids, it's entirely another to try and get *back* together for the kids. Joe clearly has moved on from your sister, and if she keeps trying to hang on to him then she also prevents herself from finding someone new", "NTA. The only homewrecker here is the serial cheater. You did your sister a favor by giving her ex that advice. Now she can move on and find someone better. \u201cDoing it for the kids\u201d is honestly one of the worst reasons to stay together.

Now obviously you weren't wrong but that's not going to change her feelings about it, she probably feels betrayed by you hopefully with time she will get a better perspective. \n\nThe biggest asshole here is her husband who is a cheater and never should have come to you for advice about this in the first place.", "NTA. You, your boyfriend, and surprisingly Joe are focusing more on the kids in this situation. Their happiness is currently more important than their parents working it out for the sake of them. Growing up in an environment of toxic love is not healthy for them.", "NTA, it is easier to blame you than accept the blame is on her husband.  You didn't wreck their marriage. Joe did. Remind her you didn't cheat. \n\nI'm not sure giving that advice was the wisest choice, telling him to end the marriage is something that, if he acts upon, will get you blowback.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn\u2019t realize it right now, but you did the right thing and you did her a favor.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t care about her, but someone else will and they will treat her the way she deserves and they will be happy to coparent with both of them. \n\nShe will come around.

You did what you thought was right, but it was hard and it is going to have reverberations for you and your sister for years to come.  \n\nIn time your sister may realize this was the best thing possible for everyone, then again she might not.

I cannot fault her for that. She also made her objective clear to her sister. \n\nNow, you aren\u2019t obligated to support your sister, but you knew she wanted X, and you knew your advice to this man wouldn\u2019t favor your sisters goals but actually be contradiction. \n\nYes you told the best advice in your opinion. \nBut it\u2019s equally true you did so with full knowledge your sister wouldn\u2019t want you to do that. With the knowledge your sister was trying to save her marriage. \n\nAll of those statements are true. So while you may not be an AH, I don\u2019t think Vicky is in the wrong for being upset. Generally I think it\u2019s pretty normal within a family that if you aren\u2019t going to be supportive of what someone wants, unless it\u2019s a guaranteed danger or harm you mind your business after you\u2019ve said your piece to them, which you had.", "To summarise: Joe checked out of this relationship and wanted to move on without being the bad guy. This is obvious from Joe's behaviour. No more being sneaky, no more hiding, no more discretion, he was openly and publicly dating (*cheating*) with the intention of finding a new girlfriend. Then he called you up under the guise of, \"I'm sorry for my behaviour, I'm in over my head, what should I do?\" You took the bait and advised him to shit or get off the pot. Joe than told Vicky you had advised him to end their relationship and focus on the kids and his new life. Which isn't a lie. Now the family is blaming the breakup on you, not Joe. Joe gets what he wants, to walk away without looking like the bad guy.\n\nJoe has successfully played your entire family. Including you. I'm sorry but credit where credits due, Joe knows you all well and you all behaved as he anticipated. I think you should focus on your pregnancy, perhaps spend time with your bf, friends and in-laws, step back from your family for a bit. An important life lesson is people will stay in a miserable situation until they are ready to leave. And sometimes that \"I'm done\" feeling never comes, and it's frustrating to watch play out. Vicky wasn't done with this situation. She was happy to continue to swallow whatever lie Joe threw at her and carry on the relationship, pushing the knowledge he was still cheating deep down. That's why she's blaming you. And you meant well, but you never should have listened to Joe's BS or given him advice. Next time, \"you should be having this conversation with your partner\" and hang up. You did perfectly taking the picture, sending it with the caption you wrote. Next time leave it at that. Even if it means rolling your eyes as they let it pass again. You can't want better for someone than they want for themselves. NTA", "I will never understand this 'staying together for the kids' shit. \n\nMy life was MISERABLE  when my parents were unhappily married.  \n\nKids KNOW. \n\nHappily divorced parents who are focused on their kids are much better equipped to BE good parents than miserable married ones.", "So if I understand correctly, after finding out your BIL was still cheating on your sister, you told your sister, who then still wanted to \"work it out\" with him. He called you and asked for advice on what to do, and you said basically, \"Pick a lane. Either commit to the marriage, or break it off\". And he chose to break it off finally, and since he clearing doesn't want to stop cheating?\n\nAnd your sister is saying YOU ruined her family? Not her husband who can't keep it in his pants? Not her for not having the self respect to walk away from someone who cheats on her? \n\nNot saying it was your sisters fault she got cheated on, but at some point you have stop letting a person treat you like a doormat just because you love them. \n\nAnd your mom calling you a homewrecker? No, that is the chick you BIL was dating that knew he was married. And BIL, of course. \n\nNTA. You told BIL to make a choice, cause the back and forth was hurting your sister and the kids. So he did. And he did not choose your sister.", "Couldn't you have just said that it's not your place to comment and that if they want to be together they need to decide together and make it work. Worst case of you had to advise something couldn't you have advised they seek marriage counseling before they make any decisions.", "I mean, you\u2019re 20 years old with no relationship counseling experience, and he was an idiot to get your advice, and you weren\u2019t much smarter to give it. You should have told him to seek counseling.", "YTA - you're not Joe's therapist, I agree with your mom, you should have kept your mouth shut. I'm sure anybody else would have told him the same thing, but those \"anybody elses\" are not Vicky's sister. Now you've permanently damaged your relationship with your sister and for what? To act as a counselor to your BIL?   \nHe already knew what he had to do, you just put yourself out there as a sitting duck. AH move.", "NTA.  Your sister is delusional, as is your mother and your ex BIL just isn't husband material.  He asked you your opinion and you told him what you thought in a kind and non-confrontational way.", "NTA. But Joe certanly is. If he had doubts about the marriage, he should have told his wife. I bet he was feeling like this months before your sister were pregnant.\nHe is a completely d*ck, so is his AP (the first one) and your sister is delusional.", "NTA. You\u2019re the messenger being shot. Don\u2019t try to reason with them, they\u2019re going to have to process it. If they continue to blame you that\u2019s on them.", "NTA I know it sounds hard but honestly it was the best advice. She needs to find her own peace rather than rely on joe with him constantly cheating on her.", "NTA.  And I'm sorry your mom called your what?  The only homewrecker is your BIL and the fact that your mom blames you and not the cheater is absolutely delusional.   Do yourself a favor and put your mom on a time out for awhile.", "I think that you gave him good advice. People often use the kids as an excuse not to confront the fact that their relationship isn't working for them anymore. And honestly, as a person who grew up with my parents never showing any affection to each other, and having arguements daily to the point of hating each other, normally break ups are for the best to all the parties. Your sisters and her husband deserve to be in a fulfilling relationship, and their kids deserve not to see their parents constantly going through things like that.", "NTA.\n\nAs a child of parents who had a toxic relationship and only stayed together for me, it really had a negative impact on my life. I\u2019ve got so much unnecessary trauma and anxiety as a result. Joe and Vickey being civil co-parents will definitely be better for the kids in the long run.", "NTA Your Sister is projecting her pain into anger at you.  This guy was never going to be a good partner to her. This is a good opportunity for your Sister to grow and be independent without needing to constantly question her partner\u2019s loyalty.", "NTA: the ending was inevitable, she's just hurt and looking for someone to blame.... how much of that you tolerate is up to you but you're pregnant  and her feelings are not more important than yours so I suggest you put a limit on it.\n\nThis is their mess not yours, you've done your best here.", "NTA. Kudos to you for standing up for her and calling out his manipulation. If he wanted to keep his family together, then that was his responsibility to keep his parts to himself. Your sister is upset for good reason, but should be more upset with her ex. He\u2019s the one who was the homewrecker.", "NTA. Joe wrecked his own home. And from the sound it he wasn\u2019t really interested in fixing it. I hope your sister comes to realize this. Your parents are being ridiculous but I\u2019m guessing they were just holding on to hope that their grandkids wouldn\u2019t grow up in a \u201cbroken home.\u201d But that was never going to happen anyway since Dad can\u2019t keep it in his pants. Hopefully they\u2019ll come around to (and apologize to you as well).", "NTA you gave good advice and I think that Joe did the best thing a shitty person like him could in this scenario.", "NTA. Tbh it sounds like you did the right thing. Joe asked for advice, it was apparent he held no attraction to Vicky and was trying purely for the sake of the kids. It wasn't working. And you aren't a homewrecker. It sounded like she was either in heavy denial about the facts or she was dead set to just keep on with the charade knowing full well he was still cheating on her.\n\nI'm glad he's still going to try and be around the kiddo's life as he reaponsibly should. But a loveless relationship with Vicky won't help anyone.", "NTA you did not break up the marriage he did,  he does not love her enough to spend the rest of his life with her.  She does not see it now but this is for the best I do hope she gets some good friends or therapy to learn she is enough as she is. \n\nThis way if she wants somebody in her life she can find somebody who loves her and whom she will be enough for.", "NTA\n\nThat man belongs to the streets\u2026not her. \n\nCrazy to happy for her to be free to find a man that likes her and won\u2019t cheat on her.", "NTA. He was looking for validation on something he was already feeling - you don't torch a relationship you want just because someone tells you to. Plus you didn't say \"ditch her\", you just said if you don't WANT a relationship with her, stop messing her around, so he knew what he wanted already. At best the conversation with you might have cut the charade short by a few weeks, but it was going to happen anyway. Your mom sounds delightful and not at all toxic BTW /s", "NTA! Tbh, your mom sounds like an enabler.. and you sure as hell didn't ruin your sisters shot at happiness..  you saved her from a potential  lifetime of being played and having her heart broken. Children should NEVER be the reason a couple stays together. It's so unhealthy as well as teaches the kids that's what a relationship looks like. She might be mad now because she's hurt.. but when she finds someone who truly loves and respects her, she will be thanking you. As for your mom, I'd try to have a talk with her and explain to her how she's only causing your sister more pain and suffering by playing into those unrealistic and toxic expectations.", "NTA. Your right that a bad marriage can be worse for kids than 2 happy separate parents. Vicky was trying to plug a sinking ship and it wasn\u2019t working. You did the right thing. Wouldn\u2019t want your mom around your kids if that\u2019s the thoughts she will be passing onto them", "NTA. Stating together for the kids is never a good idea. Kids know more than people realize and at a very young age. My parents stayed married and we knew the entire time they were and still are miserable", "nta", "Oof. I do not envy your position. NTA but anyone in your sister\u2019s shoes would understandably be upset with you right now (just looking for someone to blame, doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s right, but it\u2019s a natural reaction to a terrible situation) and depending on her beliefs she may never come around to seeing your side.", ">Joe said his reasoning for trying was for the kids\u2019 sake, and we told him that watching their parents go through this back and forth is going to hurt them more than help them in the end.\n\nAs someone who's dad only stayed with my mom 'till I was 18 for \"support\". Fuck yes, you are so right, better to have separate parents than growing up watching them drift apart \n\nNTA. And I dunno how no one else has told her this.", "Oh wow. Both your sister and your mother are in denial. NTA OP. \nThat man wasn\u2019t happy with her. Shitty move the whole cheating thing, yes. But why trying for something that it\u2019s not going to end well? Unless your sister is delusional.", "NTA! You\u2019re 100% right that the back and forth bs will hurt the children more! As a child of a nasty divorce fueled by cheating and alcoholism, I applaud you!!! The whole staying together for the sake of the kids is the biggest bunch of bullshit! It does no child any good to watch their parents be miserable and hurt each other repeatedly.", "NTA the creep was clearly going to keep cheating and your sister was going to be living a lie. You've given her a chance to find someone who is worthy of her instead of her looking back years from now and knowing she wasted years on a cheating loser", "NTA, he came to you.  Were you supposed to lie to both of them?", "NTA - I think Vicky already knew the truth and was hanging on by a thread. You told her ex the truth and any hope she was hanging on is now gone. She just wants to blame someone instead of the guy who cheated on her. She\u2019ll get over it and will be better for it. She\u2019ll gain self respect and enjoy life more instead of chasing after a cheater. No idea what to say about your mom\u2026\nMaybe dad cheated on her and she was ok with it?! Idk. I\u2019d ask her why she wants her daughter to be treated that way. I would never want my girls treated like that.", "NTA but do you really think they\u2019re going to help with this pregnancy? Your family does not seem supportive or reasonable at all", "NTA", "NTA. You didn't \"ruin\" anything. They weren't a happy family, because Joe clearly wasn't going to stay faithful to Vicki. It's better to end it cleanly, now, than for her to either constantly be worried he might cheat, or finding out he's cheating yet again.", "NTA. Joe and Vicki's relationship was all but over. He clearly didn't want to be in it. Therefore, the only \"homewrecker\" here is him. You were asked for your opinion and you gave it.

You may have hurt her badly now, but you've likely prevented her from being hurt continuously in the future.", "NTA  Your sister and mother are trying to hang onto the status quo no matter what. My mother did that with my father and it was painful to watch. The sad part is when he finally left her, her finances improved along with her quality of life. She remarried a wonderful man and they had 30 happy years together. Sometimes we fight so hard for things not to change we can't see that change can be for the better.", "NTA staying together for the kids is a recipe for making sure they repeat the same pattern. Took me a while to figure that out as the kid of parents who did it.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister needs some dose of self-respect if she thinks one man that clearly does NOT want her is her only shot at happiness. What about her kids? What about her own person and life? Also your mother is not helping by deluding your sister, I am pretty sure she was doing ok when she left and went to live with your parents, because that is the actions of a woman that has some standards, but the moment she got there your mother must have have poisoned her mind and lowered her self-esteem. Imagine begging a cheater to take you back, talk about no self-respect.", "Have you met your father's mistress(es)?  NTA", "NTA\n\nThe dude\u2019s a cheater and wasn\u2019t gonna stop. Your sister may think you \u201cruined her chance at happiness\u201d but a life with a cheater is anything but happy. It\u2019s full of resentment, mistrust, paranoia, and anger. I hope she understands that in time.", "Nta. Sounds like your sister is happy to bury her head in the sand as long as it keeps her relationship togethor. You didnt 'ruin' her family, you were honest when asked for your advice. No relationship will work if only one person is commited to it. Your sister is probably hurting and giving her anger and hurt to the wrong person. Most likely its easier for her to take her emotions out on you than him. Dont understand your mum tho. Dont take it to heart but in future just stay out of it as you get no thanks.", "NTA, he needed to hear it. Cheating is never acceptable, but it\u2019s rare for people happy in their relationship to cheat. Joe doesn\u2019t want Vicky, she won\u2019t make him happy and he lacks the self control to not cheat when he\u2019s unhappy. Vicky was never going to have the relationship with him she wanted. Everyone will be better off with this arrangement", "NTA. He already knew the right answer, you just confirmed it for him.", "NTA. You're not the homewrecker the cheater is. Joe isn't worth your sister's time or affection.", "NTA and honestly if you're staying in a relationship just for the kids, break up. My parents split before I was born. It was awesome.", "Thanks, I'll tell my boomer parents to chill.", "You didn\u2019t ruin their family, the cheater ruined their family. I personally would have told the cheater that I am not the person with whom he should be discussing this.  Your heart was in the right place, though. \n\nPlease realize that anger is a much easier emotion for people than grief. Your sister is realizing her relationship is over and needs to grieve that loss which is overwhelming for her right now. Anger is something we are way more comfortable with than grief and loss. Be aware of this and be gentle with her.", "NTA. \n\nYou didn\u2019t ruin her chance at happiness. She set herself up for failure not once but twice. I can see why she blames you, but don\u2019t let it change your mind. You and your guy were just honest with him. If he doesn\u2019t wasn\u2019t to be with Vicky then it\u2019s best to just move on. Staying together for the kids sake is an old and outdated cliche. My parents tried for a few years, it just made everything worse in the end. Also it\u2019s 2023, co parenting is much more common, doable and successful. Once the pressure between the parents to force a relationship is off the table, everyone will be much better off. The kids just have to have explained to them that mommy and daddy might not be a pair anymore, but 1) it isn\u2019t the kids fault and 2) it doesn\u2019t mean that the kids aren\u2019t going to be loved anymore. \n\nI hope with time Vicky will come to realize that having the serial cheater off her dating table will ultimately be the right thing, and that she\u2019ll come around to thank you one day. \n\nI maybe an optimist though, and have grown to have less faith in people after working in shitty customer service jobs. \n\nJust stand your ground, you were honest with Joe. You were looking out for everyone\u2019s best interest and we\u2019re not intentionally trying to make your sister feel like her life was drowning in despair.", "Work what out?  Joe is long gone from this relationship.  The only reason he was trying to save it was for the kids.  He clearly has moved on as he is dating.  This relationship was doomed to end in divorce.  All you did was help the process along.  NTA.", "Omg sooo NTA! You did the right thing by your sister. Why on earth would she want to stay with a man that will not be loyal to her?!\n\nAnd why would your mother encourage her in that?? That is so toxic. A normal mother would be enraged that someone could hurt and disrespect her child like that, and would encourage her child to get out of that situation and move on to something better.", "NTA. What Joe did was respectable. The wife wanted to get back together, but he didn't. He called his SIL to get advice about this with your partner. You two are your sister's best advocates along with the parents. What did she expect, you to beg him to be with her deespite not wanting to? That isn't so great. If Joe was really interested, he wouldn't wouldn't seeing another girl.", "NTA- I believe that your sister wants something that isn\u2019t reciprocated. \nIf he's seeing someone that he is interested in that means that he isn't interested on working on their relationship. For her to push him to want it because she wants it, it's not how it works. \n\nAs far as you and your boyfriend asking and listening to him, because he approached you isn't wrong in my eyes. You are outside their picture and is able see what they can't see or not willing to see. Your sister wasn't asking him what he wanted in aspects of her and the kids. \nA person can love their kids with all their might but not love you!\nWhat kind of relationship is that to live!?\nThey will be in a miserable marriage\nIt will affect the raising of the kids. \nAs a sister you did what I think she would understand in the future. I hope!", "YTA, she already told you that she did not like your opinion. He was thinking about trying but you put your opinion on him and should not have bombarded him with your opinion even when asked. You should tell him that he should stop hurting her and that\u2019s it.", "Poor Vicky and her self esteem, why would she want such guy? NTA, she'll forgive you and maybe even thank you.", "My dad\u2019s girlfriend stayed married to her husband until he died \u201cfor the kids\u201d. While they both dated other people, the kids spent time with me and my brother, etc. \n\nUnsurprisingly, the kids now have more issues than the library of congress.", "No, not anyone. Some people think it's better to fake it for the kids, and model an unhealthy relationship for their entire lives.", "NTA, but Joe set a trap for you. \n\nHe wanted to end the relationship, he knew what you would say to his planned line of questioning and was able to say \u2018I\u2019m ending the relationship based on OP\u2019s advice!\n\nAll the blame gets shifted from his cowardly ass onto you.", "Potentially the mother is in her 50s, so her attitude is hardly Boomer-era, just ridiculous", ">boomer-era \u2018stay together for the kids\u2019 stuff\n\nThose people are beginning Great-Grandparent age now.  Can't excuse the times anymore.  My guess is strict religion.  They might also believe financial stability (including the ability to live in a \"good\" neighborhood) and/or the ability for one of the couple to be a stay-at-home parent trumps all.  The reality is that most SAH parents can't do that anymore after divorce because the clock is ticking on their alimony/palimony running out, and both are going to have to downsize their living quarters, which might mean moving to an area with not-as-great schools, etc.  It's just economic reality.      \n\nHopefully Sis will see that it's the best for everyone.  Right now she's still living in the fantasy that she could still have kept him if OP had only butted out.  He clearly isn't in love with her anymore and is solely desperate to be a father to his kids, and affairs aren't going to be enough in themselves for her to get full custody.  Co-parenting will be best for all.\n\nShe might need professional help to deal with this, and the reality that she can't make a clean break with him since there are kids involved.  That will likely include coming to terms with the children developing relationships with anyone he's with long enough and seriously enough to become his SO.\n\nOP, I think all you can do is keep letting her know you love her, and think she deserves better than someone who Just Isn't That Into Her, even if that means single parenthood.", "*\"Luckily she did not end up with an STD\"*\n\n...That she knows of. Hopefully this occurred to her the first time.\n\nAbsolute NTA. He asked you both, y'all gave your opinions. It was Joe's decision to act on it, or not.", "He\u2019s probably felt pressured by your parents and Vicky to make it work when he doesn\u2019t really want to, so you probably gave him the out he was looking for.", "E S H usually is only for if both the OP and the main person of concern are both AHs so I think you want NTA", "Agreed. Joe is playing that whole family. He asked OP, knowing what the response would be, so he could use her as a scapegoat.", "OP was the fall guy for all of Joe's selfish decisions.", "Yeah, OP telling him to drop it wasn't a very good idea. It was a bad idea to get involved, especially when she admits she doesn't like him. Tho I will argue in OP's defence, he is the one who took her advice.", "Pretty much OP gave him the justification to keep doing what he's doing when she should have told him that she doesn't feel comfortable advising him with such a personal matter and that he needs to get counselling instead", "Just take a scroll through r/deadbedrooms and you'll realize how many sham marriages are existing purely \"for the kids\". It's such a shitty cop out for people who are too scared to disrupt their routines.", "First off OP, you\u2019re NTA\n\nSecond, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s generational, but my 88yo mother is in competition with all women to some degree, and will almost always side with a man over a woman, and can be dismissive of a woman\u2019s expertise.\n\nThe biggest \u201cfor instance\u201d, is that my mother has a medical condition, and my brother happened to have access to one of the top doctors in the field, someone who is cutting edge on this condition, and who happens to be a woman. My mother\u2019s doctor, who is no slouch himself, was happy to consult with the specialist, and they came up with a great course of treatment for my mother that had great results. When my mother talks about the two of them, she refers to her doctor as \u201cdoctor\u201d and the specialist as \u201cthat woman\u201d, and gives all the credit to her doctor\u2026even after he has corrected my mother multiple times.\n\nI think the \u201cdeferring to a man\u201d is just ingrained in some people\u2026", "What a fantastic message, who cares that your man steps out, better a cheat than no hubby? Is that the message your sister really wants to give your children, it's OK to mess with your vows and potentially give your partner an STD? Maybe bring up the fact AIDS still exists the next time someone calls you a homewrecker? Ask them so you're ok with your daughter/self/whatever getting AIDS because hubby can't keep it in his pants? NTA and enough killing the messenger ffs", "Your mother is where your sister learned her worth from.  People can be on the same page and it can still be the wrong one.  Give it time - NTA, OP, and it sounds like you're trying to break generational nonsense.", "The context of this situation really is that she thought everyone should be okay with cheating tho. Not just forgive past events but to continue to look away from it. Cause your position is basically like, either he stops cheating and actually makes the relationship work OR it's better to save the relationship as co-parents by not making promises he won't keep and break her hard even further. His choice is him admitting he would date other women", "What is her generation and what it the time she grew up in? Because my parents were born and grew up in the 30s/40s. This behaviour isn't silent generation in my experience.", "My mother also considered it a personal failure of hers when her kids got divorced. So she pushed hard for me to stay and criticized me harshly for standing up for myself when I was being treated badly. I don\u2019t talk to her much anymore.", "It could be generational but if she\u2019s a child of the 70s I\u2019d day no. The generation prior was mote that way . It may be how she was raised because that is handed down through generations. It sounds like your sister has adopted this attitude as well, probably learned from your mother.", "Staying together \"for the kids\" is a Boomer thing that probably comes from religion.\n\nI grew up with two parents that hated eachother, I was wishing for them to get divorced, constantly. Growing up with so much animosity, yelling and resentment flying around imo is worse than having to move houses if your parents divorce. \n\nNTA for sure. You were asked, you were honest", "Unsuspecting mom doesn\u2019t want to be stuck cleaning up the aftermath and emotional wreckage", "I think your mom doesn\u2019t want to support all 3 of her grandkids bc it sounds like you and your sister showed up with kids and she\u2019s expected to help out.", "They\u2019d either way see an unhealthy relationship and that\u2019s their first example on how relationships work. Your mom is definitely tripping.", "That\u2019s devious. Joe is TA", "That entire sub is filled with people whose relationship is already over but can't accept it.(In most cases)\n\nLike I'm sorry but the writing is on the wall. That sub also has a really hard time understand that what someone is attracted to changes throughout their life.\n\nThe differences between what 19 year old me and my current self(29) find attractive couldn't be more stark contrast.", "Ah that is my mum.   On one of my nieces wedding anniversary she went into social media and thanked him for being with her.   \n\nAfter the breakdown of her 4 marriage when I asked her to take time to heal.  It was traumatic for her and she was so afraid.    I told her to focus on spending time with friends to build up her. She told me that nobody would like her without a man.
