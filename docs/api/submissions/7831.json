Adolphe Quetelet was interested in applying statistics to social science. He wasn't looking for the \"perfect man.\"\n\nHe was looking for \"ideal\" values, where \"ideal\" is defined as \"mean values of measured variables that follow a normal distribution.\"\n\nMeaning the \"ideal man\" was the equivalent of the \"average man.\"\n\nBMI is a great way to measure populations. BMI isn't, and never was, a good way to measure the health of an individual.", "> in order fine the perfect man\n\nA gross mischaracterization of his work.\n\n>  A math formula has no relevance to health\n\nIt absolutely can, and frankly you thinking that we can't use mathematics to model things like health makes me gravely concerned as to the quality of mathematics education you received.\n\nI'm not saying BMI is perfect, but you've taken this way too far in the other direction and are throwing the baby out with the bathwater. The correct statement isn't \"math has no relevance to health\" it's \"BMI is not a perfect way to determine health\"\n\nBut it does approximate health. All-cause mortality significantly increases the further you get from a BMI of 20-25, in either direction.", "Why? \ud83e\udd14", "It seems like it is missing the point. She was an asshole, and would have been an asshole regardless of her weight. Focusing on \"she is fat and lazy\" is playing into fat phobic tropes without paying attention to why she actually deserves to be judged.\n\nShe isn't a bad person because she is fat. She is a bad person because she is making snarky comments about the OP's eating choices and health condition.", "OK I will admit you make a good point and that is something I did not consider before.\n\nI'm still judging this specific case as NTA but you have given me something to think about.", ">Attacking someone's weight makes you an asshole\n\nIt *can* make you an asshole but not in all cases. Like this one when it's said in retaliation to someone attacking your weight.\n\n>the fact of the matter is that failing to take the high road means sacrificing moral superiority. You are shooting yourself in the foot because instead of addressing your actual needs, you are just slinging mud.\n\nAgreed. Still doesn't make you an asshole.", "Well hold on. She\u2019s not saying everyone should desire to be skinny. She\u2019s saying clearly this particular girl is a little jealous - not that she should be, but that she is based on her treatment of OP.

I know you didn't have bad intentions writing this comment, but it honestly came across as rude and insensitive.", "Lmao, fatphobic", "Lmaoo, Ok chunks", "Okay, imagine this: What if the \"friend\" was actually skinny and had ordered a regular amount of food?\n\nWould the \"friend\" have been less of an asshole to make those comments? No. I think she would have been just as bad regardless of whether she is skinny or fat.\n\nChoosing to go after Amy's weight as a form of retaliation is basically saying \"Your fatness is something to be ashamed of, I just don't mention it out of politeness. If you are mean to me, however, it is a weapon to be used against you\"\n\nIt is saying that fat people have to be more careful than everyone else to be nice, because if they aren't they will face worse repercussions than someone who is skinny.", "that\u2019s Miss Chunks, actually.", ">Okay, imagine this: What if the \"friend\" was actually skinny and had ordered a regular amount of food?\n\n>Would the \"friend\" have been less of an asshole to make those comments?

Don't throw stones from glass houses and all that.", ">OPs \"friend\" made body shaming fair game\n\nBody shaming is *never* fair game. Whenever *anyone* body shames they are supporting the idea that people's bodies *should* be something to be ashamed about.\n\nThis isn't a matter of what is fair game within the conflict, this is a matter of what values and perspectives you are promoting. This is also why racism is never fair game. One person being racist doesn't mean it is okay to be racist back, because the problem isn't how you are treating the other person, the problem is the racism.\n\nThe problem with body shaming Amy isn't that is made Amy feel bad, it is that it is body shaming."]}
