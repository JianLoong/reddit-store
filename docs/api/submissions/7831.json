Your friend can comment on what you eat but when you do is a problem?

Told that I must starve myself and all kinds of crazy rumors. Would wear baggy clothes so people would leave me alone. I hate the new fat culture.

If your friend was \"concerned for you\" she wouldn't be bringing it up constantly in front of other people to try to shame and embarrass you.

I don't think you need Amy as a friend", "NTA-Your 'friend' got way too comfortable giving you her brand of help. Meanwhile, it was bugging you but you chose to ignore it. This is why you eventually snapped. All the little comments were building up in your head and you got angrier every time. But in her head, it was fine to say because, to her, you didn't mind. Yes, it would have been better to tell her off without the added insult. It would have been better again to shut her down the first time she commented. Maybe you'll both learn from this.", "ESH\n\nShe was acting badly, you responded badly. If you want to keep the high ground, take the high road.

Just like she has no right to comment on your body and what you eat, you have no right to do it to her either. It may have  felt good in the moment, but overall is just hypocritical and displaying the same behavior that you seem to be upset by. My question is why don\u2019t you just\u2026. Not be friends with her? Or instead of ignoring the issue until you snap, have a conversation with her about the consequences to your friendship if she doesn\u2019t stop. \n\nAlso, this is totally a question that has no bearing on the way I voted and I\u2019m just curious. Is it possible she doesn\u2019t know what ibs is? To me her behavior sounds like she thinks you\u2019re suffering from an eating disorder. Of course it isn\u2019t her business, either way. Just a thought.", "ESA You don\u2019t bully a bully. Her comment was rude and cruel, and you threw it right back at her. Did your response really make you feel better?", "This is a hard one so I'm going ESH. It may be that she's concerned for you and your health, she doesn't understand your medical condition, so is making mistakes when making comments, it is none of her business though, but for all you, or we know she may be coming from a good place.

I agree with another poster here it does sound like jealousy may be an issue. She\u2019s clocking too much how you eat, that\u2019s not normal. If you guys come together and she makes an apology and amends with you and you wanna continue the friendship that\u2019s cool. I personally would not budge until that happens. I frankly would just move on from the friendship. It sucks but sometimes it is the moments like this that we learn some folks are only meant to be around in our lives for a moment or season.
