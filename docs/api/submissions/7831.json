My \u2018friends\u2019 were jealous and would bully me that I had boulemia. I couldn\u2019t go to the toilet right after the obligatory break in the cafetaria because they\u2019d say I\u2019d go vomiting. It was horrible and left me with a very low self esteem. And of course, sometimes I did vomit when I ate too much or just really bad things for me. But not because I wanted to, just becayse I really couldn\u2019t keep it down. Little did I know, they were insecure and projected on me. Years later I\u2019ve learned about my condition (ibs) and my restrictions on food and how to prevent the stomach ache. Now, I don\u2019t eat a lot of stuff due to my diet (FODMAP) and I feel a lot better, but equally embarrassed sometimes. But sometimes I do \u2018indulge\u2019 and explain I\u2019ll have to be very careful the next few days.\n\nPlease don\u2019t let this girl bully you. I\u2019m not good at advise.

Apparently, it was caused by all the opioid medications they had to give me. This after an emergency ostomy and a reversal a year later. Gutted like a fish twice and all the medications to deal with it gave me gastric issues. Whee. (NOT!)\n\nLook, while McDonald's is probably one of the worst things to feed yourself if you have IBS, if you are having trouble maintaining a healthy weight and are having a good day and the McDonald's isn't going to rip you up later, have at it. Munch a cheeseburger and some fries; enjoy the good day and the treat of being able to actually EAT.\n\nBecause the one thing I have learned is that sometimes those bad days outnumber the good days and make you miserable. (I lost so much weight at one point, I looked skeletal) A boost to your mental state is always a good thing. If you are having a good day and can tolerate a Mcdonald's kind of treat, go for it!\n\nNow, mom/grandma for a minute time:\n\nHon, give yourself grace. Dealing with a severe gastric condition, especially one that is going to be chronic and life long is \\*EXHUASTING!\\*. However, you can take steps to better manage and cope with it.\n\nFirst, I hope that you are able to go to a good GI doctor. Next, consider learning how to make your own food from scratch. Cooking isn't actually hard and the nice thing about making things for yourself is that YOU control what goes into it. Some of the simplest recipes I have in my book are so darned good, yet amazingly quick and simple.  I have also found a lot of \"cheater\" items that I can eat safely that make it that much quicker. (Case in point, Uncle Ben's microwaveable rice packages. 90 seconds and boom, I have rice for a quick side dish or a base for my enchilada stew.) Next, one of the most important things about managing any gastric issue is being aware of your personal motility. Meaning, pay attention to your bowel habits and how often you go. I know that sounds gross, but if you track it down, it will give you a solid base line of what your \"normal\" should be and a goal to work towards. Pay attention to the consistency, especially after eating. That will give you an idea of what foods might be aggravating it more than others. Get in the habit of reading labels. Again, making food yourself, learning to cook from scratch made will help you manage it a lot better than eating processed foods. Also, if you can, focus on eating several small meals throughout the day. I know that is hard as a 15 year old in school, but, there are ways around it. For instance, if you can have nuts, a homemade mix of some favorite nuts and dried fruit will give you the calories you need as well as being nutrient dense; but they take very little time to eat and can be munched on the way to your next class or at break times. Pack your own lunch. Focus on higher fiber things like whole grain breads, apples and avoid junky type foods like potato chips.\n\nI'm saying this because you ARE 15. It's way harder to manage a chronic illness the older you are. I'm 54 and holy heck, these last 6 years have been brutal. If you can take steps to get on top of it now, you'll be better off by the time you're in your 20's. Bonus, you'll avoid an ostomy. Which is what a lot of IBS patients wind up with if they cannot effectively manage their condition. Bowel resections and ostomies; not fun things to experience. I have had both. It is not something you want to happen to you.\n\nYou might be thinking that these things will be expensive and hard to do. No, not really. Basically, it's just making small changes at first, until they become a habit. And, it's not necessarily expensive. Buying fresh or frozen vegetables is not any more expensive; it's getting used to how to portion them and cook them. I love the fact that I can get a bag of frozen peas and measure out an exact portion for myself without having to worry about storing leftovers after I cook. But, it's little things like using butter instead of margarine, olive oil instead of crisco, whole grain flour instead of bleached, little things. Yes, initially, butter and olive oil might be a bit more expensive, but not by much.\n\nIf you are able to, have a conversation with your parents/guardians. Advocate for yourself. Learn everything you can about your particular condition so that you can learn to better manage it. Trust me, you don't want to NOT manage it, then be in your 30's facing a resection surgery or an ostomy.\n\nAs for your friend(s), well, the human brain does not mature until between the ages of 21 and 25. 15 year old teenagers are NOT going to have the best impulse control nor judgement. This means that they aren't going to think before they speak or act, most of the time. Your friend probably does have some concern for you, but that is overshadowed by her own insecurity. She doesn't have the maturity or experience to use her words and express her feelings accurately, so, she's going to just be an AH about it to try to make you feel bad and herself better. Your other \"friends\" are much the same. However, consider if these are the types of people you want in your life. Because dealing with a chronic illness gets pretty exhausting, depressing and nerve wracking. This means that you do NOT have the time, resources nor energy for self-centered, self-entitled people sucking you dry. If they are causing you stress, anxiety, worry, fear and/or any other negative emotion on a consistent basis, they are NOT your friends and you would serve yourself better to drop kick them out of your life. Conversely, do NOT make your chronic illness your entire identity. You are NOT your IBS. You are Ballthruster0987, a 15 year old girl, soon to be a full grown woman, figuring out everyday life and who she is as well as who she wants to be. Yes, your IBS is a part of you. But it is NOT everything that you are. Do not let it take over. Make friends with people who are going to accept you, as you, not try to change/manipulate/control or otherwise attempt to stuff you into a box of their making.\n\nApples and mangos are pretty awesome for gastric issues. Plant based protein powders to use in smoothies are a good go to for really bad days, blended with things like bananas and berries to go easy on the stomach. Soda is horrible, but bubbly water with flavor enhancers are kind of nice. Drink water when you can.\n\nBut, above all, give yourself grace. Being 15 is hard enough without adding in a chronic illness. It's ok to feel what you feel, especially on the bad days. But, focus on a routine, because that will get you through the worst of them. \n\nOh, yeah, NTA", "NTA\n\nYou're *barely* outside of normal weight range, normal weight range is a guide not a gospel as well.\n\nGiven her behavior i doubt she's *barely* outside of normal like you.

Sometimes the flare up is extreme and impacts everyone.\nThen it is only natural that people that care can feel frustrated that you are doing this to yourself and it's hurting everyone.\n\nI could see a truly concerned friend become impatient and lose empathy because they watch you suffer, it hurts them too and you continue doing exactly what makes you suffer.\n\nEither your friend has lost empathy or never had any, either way, should treat you better.\n\nWhen you see someone cause themselves harm though, tough love needs to happen at some point.\n\nThis is where food journal and symptom journals are so important. \nWhen you can look back and easily see a pattern of what behaviors and foods make you much worse, you can take better accountability and better navigate.\n\nEven a cheat meal is enough to mess people up for weeks, so several is just self harm.\n\nIt's very difficult because we must eat to live and so every time we feel hunger, we must decide whether we will help ourselves or hurt ourselves. Extra hard when many social activities involve foods.\n\nI vote ETA because you're harming yourself and your friend is harming you, although I think people who care about you will speak up kindly but firmly atleast once.\nAnd I think however they speak up, you aren't going to like it because you will know you're also to blame.\n\nYou have a medical issue that you are not following proper care for, it's no different than if your friend had diabetes and refusing to eat properly or take her medication.\nYou would hurt seeing her suffer and you'd get upset with her making harmful choices.\n\nI'd say if you sat idly by while she did that and didn't speak up atleast once, then you didn't care enough.\n\nAlso that when we are sick and suffering from something that we are making worse, people are going to stop prioritizing us because we are hurting them too.\n\nIf we don't take our health seriously, neither will others.\n\nYour friends tone was negative but everything she said was true.\n\nI'd say this to you once and then never again though but I also wouldn't continue to pay attention to your condition or concerns about it if you kept self harming.\n\nI actually respect her more than the friends or family that watch you make yourself sick and do nothing. Longterm this is going to harm you significantly. \n\nFriends can say it once and then drop it but doctors and family should be involved regularly. You aren't going to like what people have to say when you know you are responsible for your actions and continued suffering.\n\nYour friend was wrong in her tone and you were wrong in what you said, I understand you've both lost patience for eachother understandably. \n\nIf you care about this relationship, you can talk one and one. Give her a chance to explain she is worried and stressed about your wellbeing, that it hurts to see you sick and making it worse.\n\nYou can explain that you appreciate her concern but you have decided to make these choices even though you suffer, you understand her feelings but don't want to keep being reminded of them. This is how you have chosen to live your life.\n\nI think that's fair.\nIt take incredible will power and consistency to avoid trigger foods, it involves changing lifestyle and ways of socializing.

It happens to everyone having a chronic issue. Learn to avoid them. Develop your own diet/routines by keeping a diary of what you eat and how it makes you feel, know what you can and cannot eat in public, and avoid talking about it at length with people who are not very close to you. And with people who ARE close to you and are willing to help, explain to them well, so they know what's going on. For example, I go out with a certain group of people from work. I know my colleague's allergies, they know certain things I can't eat (though I don't have any severe allergies myself), we can order together pretty safely, makes our lives easier.
