What are you going to do about this, now?", "Then she is an unfit mother..\n\nLook of call cps let them know the situation tell them that you are going to come clean to the mother and your fretful she will retaliate in a way that risk her sons health so you want them ready and aware. Then id tell her siblings everything. Everything. You said mother is prone to fly off the handle when she hears something she doesn't like so when u tell her you've been taking proper care of her son she may decide to run away (i consider it running away and not moving out because she has no resources or place to go) then after everyone is informed id come clean tell her my concerns justify my actions and make it clear you won't out up woth anymore bullshit lazy parenting. After 3 years its not that she \"doesn't know\" how much water he needs to drink or what foods he needs to eat she just doesn't care \n\nIf she runs to her siblings home they need to know that they need to keep her there long enough till CPS arrives. If she runs away and doesn't go to them she might go back \nto her abusive ex.\n\nAfter cps collects her child you can fight for custody of him as he's lived in your home for 3 years I believe you and your husband has grandparent rights, collects all the evidence of her unfit parenting, collect a statement from the doctor telling the judge you are the one taking charge of his medical needs and how she downplayed his illness/straight up lied about going to the doctor at all, call her job ask them to testify to missing work hours over inconsistent lies regarding the health of her son.", "This has nothing to do with her reputation. And no I am not letting it happen. I don\u2019t believe involving her siblings would benefit anyone and would only make the situation worse. In all other sense she is good to him. It\u2019s this one issue, which in itself is horrible enough. However, while I believed he was getting care, as things would get better I came to learn it was all lies. Which is when I lost my shit and forced the issues to be dealt with by the dr. She can no longer lie about it as I am in constant contact with the dr and am aware now of all appointments and follow ups.", "There is no paperwork that would come back from the dr, I did give her the benefit of the doubt at one time and believed she was taking him. She feeds him, just not what he needs for this issue. Mostly dry foods and not nearly enough fluids. I work 3 jobs and am not always around to monitor foods and prep the meals. \nAnytime I would raise the issue things would get better for a time for him, but then go back to the way they were and him struggling again", "I don\u2019t disagree, and that is why I have for a long time been trying to guide her. As soon as I am home and notice an issue ( which sometimes can be days I don\u2019t see him due to work and his sleep schedule I bring the topic up and was believing there was follow through as things would get better for a time. She doesn\u2019t live with her siblings, and giving them further ammunition will definitely not help the cause. She goes off the charts when she doesn\u2019t like something someone says, and I can deal with that, but when I found out she was lying about the medical I lost my shit.", "Thank you. To let them in would be throwing gas on an already out of control fire. On the flip side we don\u2019t discuss the other kids with anyone else either. There are 10 in total all adults, if they chose to share what is happening that is up to them. When the other kids got mad that I overstepped my husband simply advised them that my actions were warranted without going into details. They only heard that I was pissed off and threatened to have the baby taken away if she didn\u2019t do what I said. I believe she told them I said to clean the bathroom", "As of this blow up I am in constant contact with the pediatrician. Both the dr and I agree to give him the fibre bars so if she attempts to sabotage efforts of fixing the issue we can counter measure that and he has now weekly appointments to the dr for check ups. The dr calls me to advise when the appointments are, and if she shows up.", "The fact that you have to have mitigating actions in place, so she had to do better, proves even further that she is not fit to parent. Just because you can physically birth a child, doesn't make you qualified to be a good parent or a decent human being. Think only about the child and have the poor thing placed with people who aren't incompetent.", "So, while you work 3 jobs, the child is left with a negligent parent. You need to call Children's Services ASAP!", "What does your husband say or do? It\u2019s his daughter right?", "You need to inform DCFS.", "Dealing with liars is absolutely exhausting. I'm sorry. Thank you for taking in your stepdaughter and her son. I'm a single parent with a 3 year old son and I can't imagine being in an abusive relationship during his life.\n\n I'm suprised the pediatrician is giving you information. This is a complicated situation and I'm sorry. My mom thinks she knows best and I've caught her feeding my son thinga she shouldn't and I absolutely don't want him eating (family history of multiple cancers and I want to give him a very healthy start, no red or processed meat until he turned 3, tc)  and I don't approve of and its destroyed trust. Did the doc say fiber bars are a good thing to add to his diet? My mom gives my son juice which bothers me because he already eats too much sugar and fruit juice is.. generally not good. So acidic on teeth and not much fiber but tons of sugar.  I WISH juice was as healthy as the piece of fruit that's generally on the packaging! Anyway, sounds like you have great intentions. I really hope this isn't negatively affecting your marriage because this is a wonderful kind genius thing that you've done by adding what you knew to be potential drama to your house. Your step grandson or whatever you refer to him has is SO LUCKY to have you in this corner. I hope you have a wonderful day!", "He tries to help but they have a strained relationship on a good day due to how she is. He has tried talking to her, he has yelled at her, he has with this final blow up I had with her backed me 100%. He spent hours going through our video footage ( installed cameras to avoid False allegations) to show his actions when he tries to poop so I could present them to the dr.", "Thank you. Yes the dr told me exactly what bars to give and how much. Justice is severely watered down for the sugar factor. I prefer to give him water but obviously he prefers juice. I do not give him candy etc as that isn\u2019t going to help the situation and she doesn\u2019t allow him to have it. \nI work closely with a lot of drs given my profession so when I came to him with my concerns and the background/ videos he was eager to help me. \nMy husband has been my rock. He is amazing but concerned that all of this is in vain and that she will eventually pick up and leave ( possibly without her son) \nI would love to see her step up and be trusted with him, and it is just this one area she is failing but failing miserably. \nI would love to see her become the mom that I have no concerns about. She didn\u2019t really have one as she was abandoned by her own at a young age, so had no real female presence until I came along 12 years ago. \nI have always told her she needs to seek out therapy for her issues but sadly it\u2019s only effective if the person is honest and that just isn\u2019t in her vocabulary"]}
