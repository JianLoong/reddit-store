You\u2019re literally just being open and honest. Seems like your friend is just being insecure about her financial situation and is lashing out a little bit.", "NTA. You're not flaunting money by saying you have a cosmetic thing done that you like. People save up for things they want all the time? That's like someone saying a person is flaunting money when they take a huge vacation. But it's not; my boyfriend and I have been saving for years so we can go to Disney World, and will be in September. I'm not going to keep that secret because another person can't afford it.\n\nAdditionally, it's a *good* thing to share, because you're telling people to have realistic body standards. You're being honest that you weren't born with lips like that, so it's lessening everyone's insecurities by not falsely portraying your body. There's nothing wrong with getting surgeries, I don't mean it that way, but you're also being upfront that you've had outside help to look the way you do and that's ok.", ">My stance on it is that i dont want people to compare themselves to me and be like \u201cwell its unachievable because genetics\u201d It is achievable, and i dont want ppl to think i was lucky\n\nNTA.

Actually quite the opposite", "You be your honest you!  I would much rather be told that I could get fillers to to have nicer lips than to think that I will have to spend my life with lizard lips", "NTA. I think the person who says you're flaunting is jealous of you and the compliments you get. \n\n(I don't want to refer to her as a friend because she doesn't sound like one)", "You can\u2019t win with this - people will either say you shouldn\u2019t \u201cbrag\u201d or \u201cflaunt\u201d them or say you\u2019re a liar for not being honest. You\u2019re damned if you do and damned if you don\u2019t, so in that case - you usually want to just stick to the truth. It\u2019s less exhausting and if people don\u2019t like your truth that says more about them than you.", "NTA- nothing wrong with being honest when you get things done. And no its not flaunting money, its making sure others know the truth.", "NTA. You can\u2019t win with some people. If you allowed people to think it was natural someone else would have been mad", "I don't think you an AH, no.

I don't think you're flaunting your money just by saying you have a thing that costs money, that seems odd to me, and I also think it's actually very thoughtful that you're open about it for exactly the reason you said.\n\nYou're avoiding reinforcing unattainable beauty standards, you're telling people straight up \"Nah I wasn't born like this it's lip filler,\" if anything helps to dismantle that problem.", "NTA.", "NTA--- Good for you for being honest, and shame on your friend for being jealous.", "Your friends clearly jealous they probably can't afford filler lol", "NTA.

Good job doing your part to not contribute to impossible beauty standards on social media.\n\n> flaunting\n\nWho cares?", "NTA  It makes it so other women with naturally thin lips don't get a complex about it.

Also tbh I think even if you were rich I don't think it's wrong to be honest about that -- ngl I find it more annoying when a rich person pretends they don't have that privilege.\n\nI'm glad you like the way it looks.
