It is nice that you are being vulnerable enough with the people who comment on your posts to be honest about what is natural vs what is not, what was luck vs what is not etc. Your friend sounds jealous from the implicit acknowledgement that you have access to something she doesn't, but that's her issue to process and she will have to deal with similar situations of others having things she doesn't the rest of her life, just like we all do.\n\nPlus, people who lie about such things are often also usually trying to capitalize in the cultural cache of being \"all natural\" and \"just having good genes.\" This is part of why even people like the Kardashians who have very clearly had numerous cosmetic procedures continue to lie about it.", "NTA\n\nYou're being really transparent about how your look is achieved and the fact that other people *can* do the same thing you do to get the same result.\n\nThose who can afford it will appreciate the tip.

You should tell people about it.  Everyone has unexpected beauty expectations.

Like I just want people to be able to get the same things I have if they like them.  Compliment my shirt, I got it at Old Navy last week. They might still have some.

Same as saying you have colored contacts if someone says you have a beautiful eye color. I have a friend who has to get Botox injections for migraines because of the severity of them.

Honesty here in Ireland lip fillers are cheaper than dying ur hair multiple times a year. So does she feel that way about dyed hair \"flaunting\" wealth? I doubt it. \nI think your friend is just projecting her own insecurities and her not being able to afford it so she's projecting big time. If you're happy then that's all that matters.", "NTA - that\u2019s so ridiculous. you\u2019re upfront about getting filler, and people say you\u2019re flaunting your money. you\u2019re not upfront about the filler, and people say you\u2019re gatekeeping/lying/fake. you really can\u2019t win these days smh", "NTA \n\nThere literally nothing wrong about what you\u2019re doing. \n\nFrankly, lip fillers are like $800/yr. That\u2019s like $66/ month. That\u2019s cheaper than basic cable tv anymore. \n\nIt\u2019s not like you got a mommy makeover that did tummy tuck and breast augmentation. Even that\u2019s $10k and so what?! My last car I financed like twice that and paid it off in like 5 years. \n\nI feel like your friends don\u2019t know what these services cost and are grossly overestimating them.", "With all the kardashian-jenner bs shoved into our lives\n\n(Insert Michael Scott Thank you gif)\n\n\nEven though your lips are fake, the words that come of it are true and that's what truly matters. NTA", "NTA \n\nI get that it may come off as \u201coh I have money\u201d but more importantly than that it shows that you are a real person and that someone\u2019s idea of perfection is just some normal process that can be done. Too many kids have unrealistic ideas of their bodies because of influences outside and sometimes inside the home. It\u2019s very refreshing to see someone with honesty!", "My man", "I just looked it up.  Lip filler is, what, a thousand bucks a year?  That's not nothing, but it isn't \"flaunting your money\" kind of money, either.\n\nAt your age, I probably could have swung an inflation-adjisted thousand bucks a year.  That is like $20 a week, two or three hours hours at a job.  Not nothing; you would have to prioritize it as a luxury you want - but it isn't out of reach for most people.\n\nNTA for all sorts of reasons.", "NTA! It's great that you're honest and transparent about your experiences. Sharing that you have lip filler doesn't make you snobbish\u2014it actually helps break down unrealistic beauty standards and shows that achieving certain looks is possible with the right choices. Keep being open and empowering others to feel confident in their own choices.", "NTA. I think your approach and attitude is refreshing compared to the unattainable standards people are chasing.", "NTA: honesty is a breath of fresh air these days. You\u2019re probly honest about your feelings with people you date too, aren\u2019t you!? Pffft the nerve /s", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t think that if someone told me they had lip filler but that\u2019s probably because I have no idea how much it costs. Honestly I think your friend feels this way and instead of being honest she made it seem like everyone would think that and she\u2019s just helping you out by telling you that.", "Wait until the stuff wears off and deflates. You will wish for your old lips back.", "NTA. What you're doing is actually great, you're being honest and transparent regarding your enhacements and I wish everybody was like you. Also, don't like everybody use fillers now? It can't be that expensive.", "NTA. You\u2019re being transparent.", "NTA. But you might want to stop volunteering info about how you got your lips to look as they do. You owe no one, certainly not random strangers on TikTok the skinny on anything in your life. Going forward, a \"Thank you.\" will suffice. People really don't expect more than simple acknowledgement.", "NTA and bless you for being honest. My sister is similar, she is absolutely gorgeous but if you say anything about wishing you had her *whatever* she will be first to tell you how much work she's had done. It's so honest and refreshing and makes me feel better about myself", "NTA, I admit to everyone I have fillers and Botox when I get compliments. Feels dishonest if I don\u2019t TBH.", "NTA. Your friend was searching for reasons to be mad at you. If you hadn't told people about the filler, she would've criticised you for that too.", "yeah i am really pleased to see someone communicating this honestly", "I wish everyone would be honest. My friend owns a med spa and always tells people what she gets, it\u2019s always wild to see women open up about their insecurities and what they don\u2019t like about themselves. It\u2019s like when we realize other people aren\u2019t perfect, we relax a little.", "NTA, your friend is a hater and probably shouldn't be your friend anymore. You don't sound like you're flaunting anything, and even if you did, that's nobody's business.", "OP is definitely NTA, but it IS a thing now with some influencers to flaunt how much plastic they get as a form of social status. in some circles (especially in Los Angeles) the culture around filler has shifted from keeping fillers a secret, to flaunting how much filler you get on a regular basis.\n\ngirls from my old sorority have fallen into that and get a LOT of filler/botox just TO brag about it. so, the friend might just consume a lot of content where getting filler equates wealth :/", "Lizards are cute though!", "My dentist offers Botox even!", "Migraines too. I used to work for a neurologist who did peoples forehead to deaden migraine pain!!", "Yeah I had a quick google, you can get them for a few hundred bucks and they last 6-12 months. A nice hair cut & colour job would be more expensive to maintain.", "Please tell your friend to check out next vaycay that\u2019s an app that tells when it\u2019s cheaper to go! I did. but my regret was that I chose august vs September lol it\u2019s a lot Spendy in august but cheaper in September. If she wants to see sumo wrestling I think it\u2019s odd months. Idk if this changed or not but April is a good cheaper month to visit the cherry blossoms vs in May. Also double check Japan\u2019s holidays I wished I did this cuz we dealt with Mountain day so the zoo was closed! \n\nBring your own pain meds cuz you actually have to go to the pharmacy for them if you\u2019re sick. Learn the trains!!! There\u2019s a lot of sex massage parlors too which I learned the hard way lol but they can be cheap and a great massage tho! She shud also be prepared of seeing hentai comics just being causal in book stores too! Oooooh tell her she needs to go to ichran ramen shop that\u2019s under KFC in Asakusa district!! Go in the morning I think they open at 10am! Awesome ramen if she\u2019s mainly going in Tokyo absolutely carry a backpack cuz there\u2019s hardly any trash cans around. Train is definitely cheaper and their Ubers are expensive!! If she\u2019s lucky and believes in ghosts she might see one clearly like I did. My levels in the states are shit but in Japan it was living the legit I couldn\u2019t tell. I think the temples and shrines amplified my case. Sorry for the tangents I hope if she has any questions I can try to help!", "Do you honestly think the person that posted this nonsense is actually wondering whether they are flaunting? And that they sincerely need the internet to advise them of the answer? If you answer yes to either of those, I sincerely hope you are strong physically.", "NTA, but also: you can get Botox for TMJ? Mine was bad even before I had my wisdom teeth out unsedated and then got the haw-hole infected and had to get the next tooth over pulled as well and then went on ADHD meds that make me unconsciously work my jaw all day. Now I'm miserable probs 50% of days, and I'm pretty sure the other half are just because of acclimation.", "I also hope this helps men learn that they can't recognize lip filler Lol\n\nEvery AskMen about trends they hate in women has a top comment on lip filler and you know those idiots are only picturing the lips-got-stuck-in-a-Snapple-bottle body dysmorphia outcomes without realizing they actually love the look of filled lips. \n\nNTA", "I am always impressed by people who are honest. Your reasoning is sound and tell your friend to mind her business. NTA", "NTA, it's a her problem. Whenever people tell me I look good (and put themselves down in the next breath), I always tell them it's bc I got some work done. Not flaunting, bc I saved for a few years to get it, I just don't want them to feel bad about themselves or that I aged better. Shit started going south after 40 and while some women truly age gracefully, I did not, and it really bothered me. \n\nI wish more celebs would admit it. While I feel bad that they all have to get repeated procedures, I also would rather look at pretty people on screen. So I guess I'm part of the problem...", "This friend would be the type who would say you were \"flaunting your heritage\" if you \\*didn't\\* say you got filler.  You can't win with these types.  NTA, and nice to see some integrity.", "No different than being honest about dying your hair. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. It doesn't sound like you are 'flaunting'. It's kind of a double edged sword to be open about fillers. On one end you are 'promoting' cosmetics to possibly under-aged / impressionable people and on the other end you are being honest and open about it which is a good thing compared to all the influencers out there that claim to not have anything done. But really as long as you continue to be honest and open with a positive message, you remain NTA. Sorry to say your friend kinda sounds a little jelly.", "NTA-you\u2019re being transparent which is nice. As far as your friend, that\u2019s ridiculous, you can\u2019t please everyone.", "NTA, you're being transparent about what parts of your appearance are not natural. I think it's up to people whether they want to disclose or not, but if you're noticing people comparing themselves to you, then it's a good idea to let them know.\n\n I kind of see it as the same thing as a disclaimer on an ad saying that the picture has been retouched or that the model for a mascara ad is also wearing fake lashes.", "NTA- It's important to disclose stuff like that. All to often, people will compare themselves to others online without realizing that those people have had cosmetic surgery or are using a filter. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with getting fillers and such. I just think it's important not to try and pass them off as the real deal.", "NTA you were open and honest and that's so sweet of you to do so as to prevent others feeling insecure thinking it's not achievable.", "NTA. People will always find something to complain about. If you don't disclose your lip fillers, you're \"promoting unrealistic beauty standards\", but if you do disclose getting fillers, you're \"flaunting your money to people who can't afford it\".", "NTA. I think everyone should be honest about injections TO AN EXTENT. I\u2019ve been in uncomfortable situations and just not said anything, or be cheeky and just say \u201cI can\u2019t recall.\u201d If I\u2019m asked or someone comments respectfully I will always be honest.", "NTA \n\nThis kind of transparency is really important. Nothing bothers me more than to hear when an influencer or celebrity who has clearly had work done or had their skin resurfaced or they're looking 30 years younger than their real birth age claims it's just luck or genetics or good skin care. It's so fundamentally dishonest and harmful; we are socialized to feel worth less than if we think that we appear less than. If the beauty \"standard\" against which many of us evaluate our worth has been enhanced we should know that we are comparing apples and oranges.", "Nope, people need to stop policing other people's wallets. NTA and you do what makes you happy", "NTA. i had a \u201cfriend\u201d like that when i was in college\u2014always policing my behavior on social media under the guise of helping me. totally destroyed my self esteem. took a while to realise she was just jealous \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA her inability to get injections for whatever reason isn't your problem. She is projecting her insecurities and that's not on you", "NTA. By her logic, if you didn't tell them about the filler, you would be \"flaunting\" your assumed genetic good luck. You can't win. And I do think the honesty is refreshing. Hopefully you'll make people feel less self-conscious too.", "I love it, too. I have always said it would be super cool if celebreties wouldn't answer the \"how do you look so young/good?\" question with \"oh lime water and yoga.\" but rather with: \"a mix of good genes, expensive products and a talented surgeon.\"", "Aww hopefully you can go to Japan and do all the things in the future too, especially since it's your dream."]}
