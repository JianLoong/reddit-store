It is nice that you are being vulnerable enough with the people who comment on your posts to be honest about what is natural vs what is not, what was luck vs what is not etc. Your friend sounds jealous from the implicit acknowledgement that you have access to something she doesn't, but that's her issue to process and she will have to deal with similar situations of others having things she doesn't the rest of her life, just like we all do.\n\nPlus, people who lie about such things are often also usually trying to capitalize in the cultural cache of being \"all natural\" and \"just having good genes.\" This is part of why even people like the Kardashians who have very clearly had numerous cosmetic procedures continue to lie about it.", "NTA\n\nYou're being really transparent about how your look is achieved and the fact that other people *can* do the same thing you do to get the same result.\n\nThose who can afford it will appreciate the tip.

You should tell people about it.  Everyone has unexpected beauty expectations.

Like I just want people to be able to get the same things I have if they like them.  Compliment my shirt, I got it at Old Navy last week. They might still have some.

Same as saying you have colored contacts if someone says you have a beautiful eye color. I have a friend who has to get Botox injections for migraines because of the severity of them.

Even that\u2019s $10k and so what?!

Too many kids have unrealistic ideas of their bodies because of influences outside and sometimes inside the home. It\u2019s very refreshing to see someone with honesty!", "My man", "I just looked it up.  Lip filler is, what, a thousand bucks a year?  That's not nothing, but it isn't \"flaunting your money\" kind of money, either.\n\nAt your age, I probably could have swung an inflation-adjisted thousand bucks a year.  That is like $20 a week, two or three hours hours at a job.  Not nothing; you would have to prioritize it as a luxury you want - but it isn't out of reach for most people.\n\nNTA for all sorts of reasons.", "NTA! It's great that you're honest and transparent about your experiences. Sharing that you have lip filler doesn't make you snobbish\u2014it actually helps break down unrealistic beauty standards and shows that achieving certain looks is possible with the right choices.

My sister is similar, she is absolutely gorgeous but if you say anything about wishing you had her *whatever* she will be first to tell you how much work she's had done.

If you hadn't told people about the filler, she would've criticised you for that too.", "yeah i am really pleased to see someone communicating this honestly", "I wish everyone would be honest. My friend owns a med spa and always tells people what she gets, it\u2019s always wild to see women open up about their insecurities and what they don\u2019t like about themselves.

I used to work for a neurologist who did peoples forehead to deaden migraine pain!!", "Yeah I had a quick google, you can get them for a few hundred bucks and they last 6-12 months.

I did. but my regret was that I chose august vs September lol it\u2019s a lot Spendy in august but cheaper in September. If she wants to see sumo wrestling I think it\u2019s odd months. Idk if this changed or not but April is a good cheaper month to visit the cherry blossoms vs in May. Also double check Japan\u2019s holidays I wished I did this cuz we dealt with Mountain day so the zoo was closed! \n\nBring your own pain meds cuz you actually have to go to the pharmacy for them if you\u2019re sick. Learn the trains!!! There\u2019s a lot of sex massage parlors too which I learned the hard way lol but they can be cheap and a great massage tho! She shud also be prepared of seeing hentai comics just being causal in book stores too! Oooooh tell her she needs to go to ichran ramen shop that\u2019s under KFC in Asakusa district!! Go in the morning I think they open at 10am! Awesome ramen if she\u2019s mainly going in Tokyo absolutely carry a backpack cuz there\u2019s hardly any trash cans around. Train is definitely cheaper and their Ubers are expensive!! If she\u2019s lucky and believes in ghosts she might see one clearly like I did. My levels in the states are shit but in Japan it was living the legit I couldn\u2019t tell. I think the temples and shrines amplified my case. Sorry for the tangents I hope if she has any questions I can try to help!", "Do you honestly think the person that posted this nonsense is actually wondering whether they are flaunting?

Mine was bad even before I had my wisdom teeth out unsedated and then got the haw-hole infected and had to get the next tooth over pulled as well and then went on ADHD meds that make me unconsciously work my jaw all day.

Not flaunting, bc I saved for a few years to get it, I just don't want them to feel bad about themselves or that I aged better. Shit started going south after 40 and while some women truly age gracefully, I did not, and it really bothered me. \n\nI wish more celebs would admit it.

NTA, and nice to see some integrity.", "No different than being honest about dying your hair. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. It doesn't sound like you are 'flaunting'. It's kind of a double edged sword to be open about fillers. On one end you are 'promoting' cosmetics to possibly under-aged / impressionable people and on the other end you are being honest and open about it which is a good thing compared to all the influencers out there that claim to not have anything done.

All to often, people will compare themselves to others online without realizing that those people have had cosmetic surgery or are using a filter. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with getting fillers and such. I just think it's important not to try and pass them off as the real deal.", "NTA you were open and honest and that's so sweet of you to do so as to prevent others feeling insecure thinking it's not achievable.", "NTA.

Nothing bothers me more than to hear when an influencer or celebrity who has clearly had work done or had their skin resurfaced or they're looking 30 years younger than their real birth age claims it's just luck or genetics or good skin care. It's so fundamentally dishonest and harmful; we are socialized to feel worth less than if we think that we appear less than.

To me it\u2019s more confident to admit you do have filled rather than lying about it", "NTA while you don't owe anyone your medical info, telling them is the right thing to do.

Many people don\u2019t, and it is quite refreshing!", "Definitely NTA. Being completely honest about it is a huge plus to the OP in my opinion.
