Honestly I'm never a huge fan of when people resort to snide comments as a way of getting their point across. (In my opinion, a polite comment can get a point across just as effectively as a snide one, which begs the question of why someone has chosen to be snide.) \n\nBUT, all that aside, you are NTA for saying no to her request to cut in front of you. In some ways, you would have been TA if you had said yes, because it presumes that the 5 people in line behind you would have also been cool with being cut in line. You have no obligation to offer any special accommodations in this scenario - pregnancy is not in and of itself a disability.

It's even worse for that 6th person in line...\n\nI mean I get it when doing grocery or so and a pregnant lady would only buy a couple of bananas and milk and someone would let her scoop into the line in front of them. But making 6 people wait longer is just tacky.", "NTA. Getting knocked up doesn\u2019t give you the rights to be a dick lmao. NTA at all.", "NTA. The woman\u2019s friend could have waited in line to order for both of them.", "NTA.\n\nSome women seem to think being pregnant gives them the right to be totally entitled. Newsflash: it doesn't.\n\nI've been pregnant and I've never expected people to give up their place in a queue or anything else for me. It's not a disability (I'm also disabled after a car accident) but even if she was disabled, it still wouldn't entitle her to queue jump!", "I think you handled that well. And since they both decided to remain standing at the back of the line, there doesn't appear to have been any dire need to move ahead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA. I have a few kids, many pregnancies. I never asked to cut the line simply because it wasn\u2019t those people\u2019s problem that I kept getting knocked up.", "NAH.  Good for you.  You were right.  Prego could have taken a seat and huffy bro could have ordered for both.\nPregnant cards not accepted here.", "NTA! I\u2019m pregnant right now and the thought of my partner or friend using my pregnancy to cut in line is so mortifying that I want to take my pickles, brussel sprouts, ice cream, and cheese and crawl in a hole.", "Of course NTA. \nI can\u2019t stand when women think being pregnant is an automatic get out of jail free card/queen of the world pass. I\u2019ve pushed 3 kids out my cooter, I never asked or got special treatment. You didn\u2019t force that woman to grow a human, why should you let them cut you? Like you said, the friend could\u2019ve easily waited in line, let preggo B sit down, and called her up once it was their turn. Screw them, and people like that are the reason there are so many spoiled little shits in this world too.", "NTA unfortunately there are people in this world who think they own it and they seem not to want to wait just because you\u2019re pregnant doesn\u2019t mean people have to accommodate you whenever you want", "NTA. Pregnant does not mean handicapped. You don\u2019t get to skip \u2026 get in line with everybody else or go sit down and get your friend to order for you. (POSSIBLE exception would be the line for the bathroom because Anatomy.)", "NTA. It\u2019s a coffee shop not a city bus or bathroom. Like you suggested, the friend can get in line and the pregnant lady can go sit down. Heck if it were me and I wasn\u2019t even pregnant but had a friend who was willing to stand in line for me while I grabbed a table, I\u2019d be happy with that. Would have been slightly amusing if you had said sure for the pregnant lady but not the friend and only if everyone else in the line agreed by the time it was my turn. Line cutters don\u2019t realize that they\u2019re not just bothering you but everyone behind you too.", "NTA. They could have just as easily asked any of the 5 people in line behind you if they could cut in line after you said no. But they didn\u2019t. She must not have been *that* uncomfortable. \n\nYou gave them a very reasonable and IMO, obvious option of the friend ordering for them both.  I have been hugely pregnant twice. Aside from requesting cutting in line at a restroom once, I wouldn\u2019t have dreamed of asking that anywhere else.  You handled yourself well.", "NTA. Being pregnant during extreme heat is horrible, but you gave her a perfectly good alternative to having her stand in line herself.", "NTA, but please make sure you\u2019re staying hydrated and have some snacks in your bag.", "Being pregnant whilst not enjoyable at times (from what I've been told) does not entitle that person to anything. Pregnant lady could have sat while the friend ordered for her.\n\nNTA", "I'm pregnant with twins. I know everyone has different issues but I've never used it as an excuse like this, I would just sit down whilst my friend ordered if I wanted to. I'm 39 weeks pregnant now with twins so massive and uncomfortable and I'm still on my feet and wouldn't expect people to let me first in a queue! Unless I was queueing for a toilet and people were taking too long I guess.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m all for letting a pregnant person cut in line but if there was someone else to stand in line for them then it really wasn\u2019t an issue.", "NTA they were using that to try and cut the line.", "NTA. Your suggestion was logical and obvious.", "NTA, Im 8 months pregnant, and I never once have expected anyone to give me special treatment. \n\nThey\u2019re just entitled.", "No you are not the asshole, the both of them are, I've been pregnant more than once, more than twice, more than.....and had a difficult time with each.  Had to \"eat now\" had to \"drink now\" and managed to do just that without demanding special treatment when out and about,  at home people took pains and went out of their way, at work people took pains and went out of their way to make things easy so I was treated well, but I didn't impose that on the general public.", "NTA\n\nSome people just act entitled. Yes, she was pregnant, but as you pointed out, she could have sat down and her friend could have ordered for her. They obviously thought this was too much trouble and just expected everyone in line to fold to their will.", "The only times I \"cut\" when pregnant was one time to go to the bathroom and I asked nicely. And then another time I was at government office and couldn't stand in the two hour line, so the officer took a note of who was in front of me and let me sit until they got to the front. Not really cutting, but much needed relief. Oh. And I guess also airport stuff. Staff was always letting me go first and sneaking me to the front (especially customs) because I was 8 months pregnant and standing was tough. Never expected any of it though.", "I\u2019m sorry. I missed the meeting where we all voted for you to get pregnant.", "She was on her A game! The friend was trying to use her friends pregnancy to get to the front of the line.\n\nNTA", "As someone who is currently 34w pregnant I second this! I would never assume that my condition trumps someone elses. You never know what people have/are going through. I would not ask someone to give up their seat or anything just because I\u2019m pregnant. Standing is not something pregnant women can\u2019t do, and if it is medically necessary for her to sit, the solution of the friend ordering is prefect.", "Quite. NTA.", "NTA. It was incredibly entitled of them.", "To be a duck *by proxy*, even!? Because OP is correct, expectant mom *could* have sat down while friend ordered (I\u2019ve seen and done this dozens upon dozens of times, for any number of reasons including but not limited to pregnancy) and friend had exactly zero need to cut the line. So friend was using *someone else\u2019s pregnancy* to not only ask for something she personally didn\u2019t need, but to be a jerk when the answer was a reasonably expected \u201cno\u201d.", "Yeah, this was the easy solution. Friend orders while the pregnant lady sits down, problem solved. NTA", "You really have to ask your way through the line for it to be acceptable, stand in the back and then ask the person in front of you and so on.", "Even being disabled or elderly doesn't entitle them to cut in line", "Also! If she's well enough to visit a coffee shop then she's well enough to sit down and wait or stand in a queue in my opinion.", "As someone who works in an elementary school this is a regular point of contention most 5-9 year olds seem pretty well aware of.", "Yeah, people were generally very sweet to me while I was pregnant. Especially in the third trimester, crowds parted for me like the red sea without being asked. Especially fellow women were very kind. After a while I did get used to it but never expected special treatment, I was just less surprised at exactly how sweet everyone could be. I would never dream though of swinging my belly around demanding to cut queues. The nerve. I promise you those are the same moms after their baby is born, will demand that her kid blow out the candle of birthday cakes at someone else's birthday party, be a nuisance and loud in public or their home and when confronted say kids will be kids, and will demand free babysitting services from their teenage niece or nephew at family gatherings.", "I don\u2019t know. I found Larry\u2019s \u201cyou wait\u201d approach to the accessible toilet a little odd for him. When there\u2019s an available stall that no one\u2019s using, I\u2019m surprised Larry didn\u2019t stick to his guns that it\u2019s available to use unless someone who specifically needs it is there at the same time.", "This is valid.  Very young kids, pregnant ladies,  and (circimstantially) people who look to be in great need of a toilet NOW can cut me in line.  It's annoying to wait the extra time, but an annoyance to me shouldn't ruin someone's day.", "I've never let a pregnant woman cut in front of me to the bathroom. Mainly because men's bathrooms don't really have lines", "Hey this isn't cool. You really don't need to make jokes about someone's sex life because they're pregnant, it's weirdo behavior.", "Raw dog dick", "You can get temporary disability after giving birth in the US. Also, if you're on bed rest or have complications, pregnancy can absolutely be a disability. I had a subchorionic hemorrhage my first trimester and was instructed by my doctor to take it easy, not walk far distances, etc. I had to get groceries and used an electric cart, but bc I didn't look pregnant or disabled, people were making rude remarks about me using the cart. It doesn't give you a right to be entitled, but it can be a disability for some. I also had Gestational Diabetes and almost fainted waiting in line to order food after my glucose test.

Merely that when I compare that hypothetical experience to any of the actual humiliating experiences I\u2019ve actually gone through, it my strong intuition is that it would become number 1.", "You'd be surprised at the women that don't know what female sterilisation is and confuse it with a hysterectomy.

Plus the reason you get denied treatment for crappy womb ownership is the fact you'd be sterile. \n\nMakes sense that asking for womb removal and being told you're not allowed sterilisation because reasons with zero followup on the why/other valid solutions would conflate partial hysterectomy with sterilisation in most non medical peoples minds.", "That\u2019s not true about disability.

I\u2019ve been pregnant and I had to sit a LOT, but that doesn\u2019t mean I should ban myself from cafes. That\u2019s an extreme reaction don\u2019t you think?
