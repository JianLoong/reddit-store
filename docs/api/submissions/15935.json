Honestly I'm never a huge fan of when people resort to snide comments as a way of getting their point across.

Heat exhaustion can hit fast.", "NTA, and I think your reply was perfect. Pregnancy is a normal thing, not a disease, and there is no reason they should demand special treatment. As you said, if it's that dire, the friend can order for her. And it really would have been the same judgment even if you hadn't explained your history with fainting.", "Definitely NTA.  I've been pregnant and would never expect anyone to let me cut in line.\n\nEdit: damn autocorrect.", "NTA. If the pregnant woman needed to sit that urgently, her friend could order for her and wait in line. Who\u2019s to say you or someone else in that line wasn\u2019t a diabetic needing to eat\u2026. Pregnancy isn\u2019t the only thing that could need accommodations.", "I was pregnant a year and a half ago and I sat everywhere while my husband waited in line. Me being a preggonaut didn't make me special. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou told them to do the societal norm. Being pregnant is tiring but not so tiring that you can't stand in line for a coffee date or sit down while your friend orders.", "NTA.  The entitlement starts early with some people.", "8 months pregnant here, and that\u2019s not your problem. NTA\n\nIf I\u2019m too tired to stand in line, I\u2019ll either go somewhere else with a drive thru, or I\u2019ll sit down while my friend waits in line for the both of us..", "NTA. Friend could have easily ordered for her. \n\nAlso if I was behind you in line and you let people cut in front I\u2019d be pissed", "As you said, I have compassion for the lady who was with child. However, her friend who was not preggers can go wait in line.", "NTA. This is ridiculous.", "No nta. Everyone else behind you line would've been mad at you then lol", "NTA. I'm 37 weeks pregnant right now. I'm exhausted and being on my feet for more than a few minutes gives me intense Braxton Hicks contractions. I can't imagine a circumstance under which I'd try to cut in line by weaponizing my pregnancy. I look at menus while in the car and ask my dining partner to order for me, just as you suggested. I do give massive side-eye to folks who don't offer their public transport seats to the pregnant, elderly, or folks in casts, but this is entirely different.", "Nta- i hated special treatment when I was pregnant and I don't understand this entitlement. You had no obligation to let them skip. Good for you for sticking up for yourself", "NTA first come first serve pregnant people can sit while non pregnant people can stand.", "NTA Being pregnant does not make you special or more important than anyone else. Your response to the friend was fantastic. If the pregnant woman can\u2019t stand in line for her frappuccino, maybe she shouldn\u2019t be out running around.", "You handled it beautifully. A fair compromise. They made their choice. NTA", "Honestly, you\u2019re kind of an a-hole to yourself for not eating between last night and 4pm, especially if you know you faint when you don\u2019t eat. Take care of yourself OP!", "I\u2019m physically disabled and even if I were pregnant, I\u2019d just sit at a table until the line dies down then place my order. NTA at all.", "NTA. If the pregnant lady wanted to sit down so bad she should have gone and sat down and had her friend stand in line and order for her.", "The only line I\u2019ve cut during pregnancy was the bathroom one\u2026 and only then under extreme circumstances, and I still asked politely!", "When I was pregnant someone offered me to come to the start of the three person line and I made sure the people behind her and ahead of me were okay with that. They all agreed and congratulated my belly. I got my coffee and got off my swollen legs. I thanked everyone one by one and wished them all a good day. But i wouldn\u2019t have asked to skip the line.", "I have 3 kids. Terrible, awful pregnancies that had me incredibly sick through all three trimesters. But honestly, being pregnant and randomly catered to or offered special treatment/help from strangers in public always made me so uncomfortable! \n\nSome people just use it as an excuse to be extra entitled.", "Same!!", "Where I'm from pregnant women and older folks are entitled to the front of the line actually where there is not a line specifically for them. That's the equivalent of special chairs in buses for people of (with?) the same conditions", "NTA I've been pregnant with twins and I would never have cut in line.", "Exactly how Larry David would have explained the rules of society to them.\n\nNTA.", "Pregnant person here agreeing \u270c\ufe0f", "It\u2019s definitely not easy but it\u2019s not a disability! I\u2019m pregnant with my 3rd and barring any serious complications it\u2019s nothing that should get special treatment. And definitely not special treatment you feel ENTITLED to . Something tells me they were entitled even before she was pregnant", "Right? It is a cafe, not a water fountain. You'll be fine waiting for your like, scone and frappe.", "And if you\u2019re having a medical emergency, go to the hospital, not a cafe \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude09", "Right? I'm.currently super fucking pregnant and never in my life would I try to use it to cut in the line!", "Pregnancy can be a temporary disability actually :) but they did totally ignore all the people in line who could have had a disability. Many are invisible", "One could be disabled and pregnant (I was) but that still doesn\u2019t entitle you to cut in lines. Order ahead or use the drive-thru.", "They had no choice but to let them order. Because if they did anything else but go to the back of the line the restaurant would have stepped in and made them leave. \n\nBeing pregnant doesn\u2019t make\nYou special and your not entitled. Like one poster said if waiting in line is so hard on you then you really should not be out and about. You should be home resting with your feet propped up.", "i think they realize and they just don't care", "Right. Proper line cutting etiquette is to start asking in the back\u2026.. lolol", "I think plenty of people have had a \"this is going to happen whether you are on the toilet or not\" moment so there is some empathy.\n\nThere is no such urgency with food and drink outside of a 911 situation.", "At 8 months pregnant, I did ask a huge queue for the ladies room if I could skip ahead. I was ushered through like I was a bomb about to explode. :)", "Most often, yes. But given artificial insemination, IVf, etc- she may have never had dick in her life, just medical intervention with specimens procured from a d!ck", "You might've been!", "I sort of feel like the bathroom is more understandable, though. I get that. At the end of pregnancy and/or with a toddler, you should get first dibs if it's a bathroom emergency.", "Not even a dick, maybe just balls.
