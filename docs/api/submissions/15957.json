I used to have a pixie cut, which I maintained for six years. While I did love it, the main reason why I kept cutting it short was because it looked awful whenever it grew longer. Last year, it started growing well for the first time in forever, so I decided to grow it out. I haven't gotten a haircut since January 2022, and my hair is now just past my shoulders. I have no interest in cutting it shorter right now.\n\nAnyway, my childhood friend \"Ally\" is getting married next month. Last week, I saw her for the first time in a while at our friend's birthday party. The first thing she did when she spotted me was comment on my hair, saying she was shocked it looked as pretty as it did.\n\nThe next day, Ally called to say she wanted me to get a pixie cut again for her wedding day. I was a bit shocked, but politely declined.\n\nAs much as I loved having short hair, I had to get it cut every 3 months to keep the hairstyle. If I didn't, I'd get a mullet that would put Hulk Hogan to shame. I have my own wedding coming up next year, and I want my hair to be longer by then. Also, while it's not too far off my budget to get 4 haircuts a year, I had a baby 3 months ago, and I'd rather spend that money on diapers and clothing.\n\nAlly got more forceful, demanding me to do it. She said that her family, who hasn't seen me in years, still thinks I \"look like a boy\", and that seeing me with longer, more \"feminine\" hair would take her spotlight. I'm wearing a dress to the wedding, and my boobs have increased twice in size since I started breastfeeding, so I don't think I'd \"look like a boy\" even if I did get a pixie cut, but oh well.\n\nI offered to wear a wig (my friend has one he can lend me), but nope. She wants me to cut it. I might've considered her request if I was in the wedding party, but I'm not. I'm just a guest.\n\nAlly hasn't banned me from the wedding or anything drastic, but is clearly bitter about this. She's been making passive-aggressive comments about my refusal in our group chat, and keeps sending me old pictures of us from when my hair was still short.\n\nI really don't want to budge on this, but I'm starting to doubt myself.

These are not models getting paid to be in a show, these are friends. She can ask them to wear matching dresses and style their hair similarly. I\u2019d even think asking everyone to get their hair nearly trimmed isn\u2019t a huge ask but theirs a difference between a trim to clean your current style up vs completely cutting off all your hair.  \n\nAnd you have your own wedding coming up!

Ally's request is completely bonkers. No matter what she may think, wedding guests and members of the wedding party have bodily autonomy and brides don't get to violate that principle.

You like how it has grown out and you are going to continue to grow it out for your own wedding.  Since this seems to be a source of contention for her, she has two choices.
