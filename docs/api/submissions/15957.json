I used to have a pixie cut, which I maintained for six years. While I did love it, the main reason why I kept cutting it short was because it looked awful whenever it grew longer. Last year, it started growing well for the first time in forever, so I decided to grow it out. I haven't gotten a haircut since January 2022, and my hair is now just past my shoulders. I have no interest in cutting it shorter right now.\n\nAnyway, my childhood friend \"Ally\" is getting married next month. Last week, I saw her for the first time in a while at our friend's birthday party. The first thing she did when she spotted me was comment on my hair, saying she was shocked it looked as pretty as it did.\n\nThe next day, Ally called to say she wanted me to get a pixie cut again for her wedding day. I was a bit shocked, but politely declined.\n\nAs much as I loved having short hair, I had to get it cut every 3 months to keep the hairstyle. If I didn't, I'd get a mullet that would put Hulk Hogan to shame. I have my own wedding coming up next year, and I want my hair to be longer by then. Also, while it's not too far off my budget to get 4 haircuts a year, I had a baby 3 months ago, and I'd rather spend that money on diapers and clothing.\n\nAlly got more forceful, demanding me to do it. She said that her family, who hasn't seen me in years, still thinks I \"look like a boy\", and that seeing me with longer, more \"feminine\" hair would take her spotlight. I'm wearing a dress to the wedding, and my boobs have increased twice in size since I started breastfeeding, so I don't think I'd \"look like a boy\" even if I did get a pixie cut, but oh well.\n\nI offered to wear a wig (my friend has one he can lend me), but nope. She wants me to cut it. I might've considered her request if I was in the wedding party, but I'm not. I'm just a guest.\n\nAlly hasn't banned me from the wedding or anything drastic, but is clearly bitter about this. She's been making passive-aggressive comments about my refusal in our group chat, and keeps sending me old pictures of us from when my hair was still short.\n\nI really don't want to budge on this, but I'm starting to doubt myself.

She is telling her wedding guests (and friends!) how to cut their hair for her wedding so that they will look less pretty? She doesn't get to ask that. \n\nShe's being so totally unreasonable that I would reconsider attending, tbh. But whatever you decide to do, give her suggestion zero airspace. And it might be worth getting ahead of this with any mutual friends - maybe coming from a place of 'I'm a bit puzzled by Ally's behaviour - she asked me to cut my hair for her wedding so it wouldn't look as nice?!?'", "The way I would of uninvited my self to the wedding!!! You\u2019re nicer than me", "I was a bridesmaid at my besties wedding and I had practically neon pink hair. I was the only one. She was fine with it.", "SMH as a guest, omg the audacity of some people", "This isn\u2019t about your hair, its about her desire to control you. Otherwise, a wig would\u2019ve been fine. My guess is she\u2019s jealous (and a lousy friend).  NTA", "NTA, she\u2019s not your friend. Don\u2019t go to her wedding and don\u2019t invite her to yours", "NTA - that's ridiculous.  She's delusional.   You also don't have to justify why you don't want to cut it.", "NTA\n\nEven if you were in the wedding party, she wouldn\u2019t have a right to ask you to cut your hair. But you\u2019re just a guest?! Doesn\u2019t she have important wedding things to focus on instead of worrying about your hair?", "i think former friend is the correct title for her dont you think .... i would book something equally fun to do on her wedding day and never speak to her again", "NTA \n\nShe doesn't sound like a very good friend", "Yes, of course it's your wedding, of course you get to choose how I, as a guest, wear my hair. I'm sorry I was wrong to doubt that. Anyway, the options you have to choose from are\n1) I wear my hair as it is at your wedding\n2) I wear my hair as it is not at your wedding. \nI look forward to hearing what you decide \n\nOp is NTA", ">she doesn\u2019t have the right to demand you cut your hair.\n\nYeah I think there was a big movement sometime not too long ago, something about my body my choice or something that could relate to this", "It's totally obvious because she said she didn't expect OP to look so pretty. \n\nNTA. And OP needs better friends.", "Instead I\u2019d say get extensions! All the way down to your ass\n\nThat\u2019ll make a statement lol", "Steal HER dress and wear it it does 15.5 million HP emotional damage", "How old are you guys? If you are older than 25 this is ridiculous behavior and you should really not be friends with someone that acts like this.", "She's harassing you and has made it clear she doesn't want you there as you currently look. she just doesn't want to look like the monster she is by withdrawing your invite. She doesn't want you there. Why go somewhere you're unwelcome? Tell her she's made it impossible for you to come to the wedding and support her and enjoy the day so you'll back out.", "Well tbf, Ross's gf had shaved her head before and said she liked having that cut and was considering doing it again. And she was better off without Ross.", "This summer I did an extreme androgynous k-pop inspired short haircut because I wanted to. It's been interesting growing it out. You know exactly how challenging it is. \n\nNobody who truly likes you is going to expect you to cut your hair short again because they didn't expect you to look so pretty. \n\nThe bride is a mean girl. And so are the rest of your so called friends. \n\nFocus on what's good in your life and let this toxic nonsense go. \n\nMy grandma had a saying that loosely translates to let it fall off your back like water off a duck. Do that.", "NTA. She\u2019s a whole bunch of toxic. \n\nAnd I\u2019d keep away from her in person. You don\u2019t want her to \u2018accidentally\u2019 get chewing gum or something in your hair requiring you to cut it off.", "Do not trust this woman. She sounds like the kind of person who will cut a chunk of your hair out at her bachelorette party and say \"It was just a joke\"\n\nThis woman is not your friend and you really should consider staying as far away from her as possible b/c her request is unhinged.", "Maybe wear red and mess with her head?", "If the bride wants you with a pixie cut she can buy OP a wig with a pixie cut.", "I also wonder. I assumed older but after some of the comments about the friend group, I started thinking very early 20s?", "[removed]", "I\u2019d be super careful around them. This is when you see Reddit stories about people creeping up and cutting off someone\u2019s hair from behind territory.", "That sounds much less like an actual friendship than it does social inertia. It's theoretically easier to just ignore that she sucks than to excise her from the social circle for sucking.", "Comment stolen from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/132h1k3/aita_for_refusing_to_cut_my_hair_for_my_friends/ji4zoxi/)", "It's not normal. It's over the top. \n\nNormal people aren't the subject of aita posts. \n\n(I live in the US. Most people who are getting married don't use that as an excuse to be an unmitaged ah)"]}
