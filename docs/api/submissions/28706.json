{"id": 28706, "submission_id": "175grck", "title": "AITA for not wanting to go on a family cruise...with my EX husband?", "selftext": "Quick Back story: Married six years, divorced in 2001. Amicable split, remained cordial for our son. Ex-husband would fly from out of state for a week over Christmas break to see him. He always stayed at my parents house. No big deal to me. I didn't live there and our son was happy. Except that one year we were all together. Very awkward and uncomfortable for the person I was in a relationship with at the time.\n\nAfter our son graduates H.S. he moves 1525 miles away to live with his dad and start a career. Everything is going great. I remarry in 2020. Everything is going great. Now I bring you to last week. \n\nParents are celebrating their 40th Anniversary in Dec. 2024 and they have picked out a cruise and have an open invitation for family and friends to celebrate. Everyone pays their own fare. I get the info to select a cabin and am ready to make a down payment. Phone rings, it's my mom with GREAT news! My son has asked his father to be his roomie. She is thrilled and all she can talk about is everyone being together. I'm like meh. I think about this for hours after we hang up. The more I think, the angrier I get. The decision is made to not join the family cruise. I inform my mother and she is pissed!!! She is defending the decision that she and my son made together. Never once thinking to reach out to my husband and I first to find out how we'd feel.\n\nMy husband of three years doesn't know my sons father. And the thought of hanging out with his wife's ex-husband isn't exactly his idea of a good time. My ex-husband isn't a bad guy. But I divorced him for a reason and the thought of spending five days with him makes me cringe. Yes, I know it's a cruise ship and there's lots to do, but if I want to do something with my son, his dad will most likely tag along. I can't make this make sense.\n\nDo we go and suck it up? Or should I invite my mom's ex-husand (my dad) and his lady friend to join us? \ud83e\udd23", "created_utc": 1697038008, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/175grck/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_on_a_family_cruisewith/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's possible your mom never even thought that it would bother you and your husband.  NTA.", "NTA.  But if you do go, it should be with your dad and his GF.  Sounds like fun right mom?", "NTA\n\njust don't, this is a train wreck waiting to happen. \n\nMake it clear if your ex is going you and your husband are not.", "NTA.\n\nI understand your point of view: Divorced him for a reason. Obviously, your mother still thinks he's a part of her family, while your partner is... not.\n\nOh, and, please tell me what she said to you inviting your dad and his lady friend to the cruise. I mean, it's fair play, it's an open invitation, she should not have a problem with that, right? (I understand you would not invite him, but that your mother does not know, right?)", "NTA- it\u2019s one thing to have the ex over for holidays. My parents did this as well, and it was great for all the kids, and now all the grandkids. No one ever had to choose. Over time, my dad and mom\u2019s husband hang out and chat at these things. And when grandkids were born my parents would carpool together to my sister\u2019s to help out. So- in terms of the long game, you are doing really well. \n\nHowever, my dad would jump overboard if he was trapped on a cruise ship with my mother\u2019s husband. I get how your parents just assume everyone gets along so why would this be an issue, but it is more a kind of controlling wishful thinking than reality.", "NTA - I don't care how big the ship is, I couldn't stand being on it with my ex. I'd tell your mom that you'll take her and her hubs out for dinner when they get back. If she throws a fit, THEN say So you'd be ok with me inviting dad (her ex) and his girlfriend? She might understand your position then.", "NTA\n\nWhy would she even do this?  Just wow.", "NTA.  Your mother has decided that your ex is more important than you.  Time to cut contact with her and move on with your life.", "NTA Look, inviting your dad would just be petty retaliation. Toss that idea if you were actually serious. \n\nI get not wanting to spend that much time with your ex. Believe me I do. But a cruise ship is huge. You\u2019ll see him a few times at most. A dinner or two. If you decide to go, talk to your ex about it openly and honestly and let him know you\u2019re uncomfortable and why, and discuss having time with your son where your ex goes to the casino or something. \n\nYour mom absolutely should have consulted you first. I tried to let my ex stay close to my family and in concept, that made sense until she kept being toxic and I no longer could allow it. You said you\u2019re amicable. This trip could actually work and you can demonstrate coexistence to your son.", "NTA. 2001 is a lifetime ago. Your parents should have known better. This is worse than being stuck with someone until the kids are 18.", "NTA. Don\u2019t go. I can\u2019t imagine your ex giving you and your husband quality alone time with your son. This trip does not sound relaxing at all. Just say no.", "Make your stand and don\u2019t go or you mother and son will never understand the reasoning. Your ex should have said no he wouldn\u2019t go because it might make you uncomfortable. He\u2019s been getting away with it for years and a precedence was set. Hard to get out of that one but by not going maybe they\u2019ll get a clue. Sorry you\u2019ll miss the cruise.", "NTA\n\nI'm not sure how your son or mom both think this is a good idea.", "NTA. No.", "YTA. Your son is now an adult, you can just \"let's do xyz, just the two of us\". Your ex can find something else to do.   \nHe's your ex. You're remarried. Your parents clearly still see him as family. This is a you problem to get over.   \nI say this as someone who's ex-husband talks to my mom weekly, and goes to see her to help set up her electronic equipment. We still celebrate holidays with them and our kids. Any new partners just know this going in. Would I love to cut ties with the ex? Yeah, but it isn't going to happen. Learn to live with it.", "ESH. They should have talked to you first but it seems like you guys have been amicable and divorced for over 20 years. Your son made the invite so obviously he wants to spend the trip with both of you. It\u2019s only weird if you make it weird. One of the best part of adulthood has been my divorced parents finally being able to do stuff together without the drama. They\u2019re just over it and it\u2019s nice. What will you do if your son has kids and wants to include you both on future trips? Parties? Events? Skip time with your grandkids over your ex that you say you have no issue with?", "NTA\n\nLines are way blurry on this one.", "NTA", "ESH The most important part of this is that your son invited his father. So...I don't really see what the issue is since a cruise is huge asf. You're making it seem like its a trip to disney and your son is an infant.

A nice idea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Never once thinking to reach out to my husband and I first to find out how we'd feel.\" .. Does not matter. Your sin invited HIS DAD. Compleately fine, adn a great idea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut: After 20+ years, you should really be over it. But if you can niot get over your ex, you are fine to decline. Simply don't go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Or should I invite my mom's ex-husand (my dad) and his lady friend to join us? \" .. Not okay in this specific case, because it is your son's cruise. But do it next time when YOU host your mom for christmas or thanksgiving. Now she has started it, it would be a nice idea to bring the family together that way. If it is fine for her to do it, it certainly is fine for you, too.", "i don\u2019t see the big deal, do you expect to never see him again ? y\u2019all have a child together, your acting extremely childish.", "1. It is a huge ship. \n2. Lots of activities and excursions. \n3. You don\u2019t have to DINE with them every morning/noon/night!!! You and your husband can have romantic breakfasts, lunches and dinners solo. \nYour parents can choose ONE NIGHT to celebrate\u2014 can you be a big girl and suck it up for ONE NIGHT?  You know, show your SON  how CLASSY his mother is/can be??\n\nIf you happen to pass your ex on the ship, you can do the classy nod, and keep walking, as if he means nothing to you. \n\nHave a lunch date on the ship with just you, your husband and your parents. Tell your son you\u2019d like to have a couple of meals with just him. The ship is big. His father can fend for himself a few times\u2026 \nThe more you push back, the more it looks like you haven\u2019t released the past. \nThe ship is like a city. Yeah, you might run into your ex, but so what? \nYou\u2019re HAPPILY MARRIED, right?!", "YTA Suck it up", "Thats ur sons father\u2026 why would he need permission?\n\nI would be more upset about my ex at my parents then I would be with my son asking his father to come with him on a cruise\u2026\n\nAnd No one asked u to room with ur ex\u2026\n\nYTA.", "Soft YTA. \n\nI might be projecting here so take it with a grain of salt. I say this as a child of divorced parents. It is so exhausting having to manage your relationship with your parents and then manage their relationship with each other. \n\nI\u2019m engaged and I\u2019m seriously considering eloping because I don\u2019t want to deal with the stress of my parents in the same room because of incidents (\u201cI\u2019m not going if he/she goes\u201d) and comments (\u201cI don\u2019t even know why X wants to go\u201d) like yours. \n\nThe way you react now will determine the decisions your child makes in the future. It is clear that your ex husband clearly has no problem being around you and unless there was something else going on (like abuse, cheating, etc) I really think you ought to learn to suck it up lest your child use this as the basis of their decisions moving forward. From your post, it doesn\u2019t look like your ex has done anything terrible, doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s been taunting you. His presence just makes for awkward situations and if that is the case, learn to get comfortable being uncomfortable. \n\nThe only person who\u2019d be missing out is you (and new hubs I suppose). You and your spouse have decided not to go on a trip because of someone else\u2019s presence\u2026.and that person hasn\u2019t even done anything terrible to you besides divorce you which sounds like a (good) joint decision. \n\nYou made a decision to marry someone when things were good, then they weren\u2019t so good and you split up. The problem is that time has passed, you both share a child, and whether you like it or not you\u2019re attached to each other for the rest of your lives. Divorce doesn\u2019t mean someone stops being family, just means you might treat them a bit differently. \n\nStop letting the mere presence of someone else ruin the relationships you\u2019re making with others. If you don\u2019t want your ex on trips you\u2019re on, that can be the standard going forward. For this trip, I suggest you suck it up. Cruise ships are huge, you\u2019ll only have to see your ex if you want to and MAYBE if y\u2019all choose to have a family dinner. \n\nGo on vacation, have fun, swallow your pride (if that\u2019s what this is), and if there are underlying reasons you don\u2019t want your ex around communicate those. The people that love you will be willing to make the accommodation for you, but they can\u2019t do anything if they don\u2019t know there\u2019s a problem.", "YTA, they view your ex as family, because he's tbe father of your grandchild. You care more about being petty than your son or parents apparently. This exact scenario constantly gets posted with opposote genders and the guy is told to man up so man up.", "ESH The most important part of this is that your son invited his father. So...I don't really see what the issue is since a cruise is huge asf. You're making it seem like its a trip to disney and your son is an infant. I doubt you and your ex will be interacting that much.", "YTA  - And I think you should reconsider. You should speak to your ex about you having some time with your son to do things specific to you, and he can have the rest of the time with him. They will be in the same room after all. \n\nI think it's been 20 years since you got divorced and you said yourself there's plenty to do on a cruise. There are plenty of places to hide and you don't have to see your ex but a few times during dinner. If that. \n\nDo you not want to celebrate your parents? You kind of making this cruise about you - and that's extremely selfish. It's not about you, you ex already hangs out for a week + at the holidays, how is this any different?", "YTA- do you know how bih a cruise ship is?", "NTA. But yes invite your dad and his lady friend. Or at least tell your mom you will go see if she sees the absurdity!!", "If your mom was paying I would say suck it up, go. Family is complicated. \n\nHowever, if I had to pay to do something I knew would give me cringe vibes the whole time, I would never do it. \n\nNTA\n\nAlso... I would totally ask you dad to help make a point. Make it look like you really invited him. Have him send you some fake messages about joining and send her screens. See how she feels.\n\nIn the end though this is totally your choice. I do think your mom (and possibly son) could have talked to you about this before they did it. Bare minimum an apology from them from not doing so. It would be a lot easier to stomach had you been asked and not told.", "NTA\n\nBut I'm down for the invite to daddy and his lady friend! Even if you don't invite them, tell her you did, and they have booked their room.

I HAVE NOT WANTED SOMETHING THIS BAD IN A LONG TIME.\n\nA very similar thing happened to my half-sister, actually.  Our mother was planning a big family cruise.  My half-sister was in the process of divorcing her husband (a messy process, but they are amicable co-parents now that it's done).  Our mother and my stepfather absolutely *adore* their ex-son-in-law and were insisting he go on the cruise because, \"our grandchildren should have their first cruise be with both parents.\"  Like, that's some sort of tradition or something.  Like, the kids (who were 3 and 5 at the time) were going to be deprived if their father wasn't there or something.  Absurd.  Now, my mother was lucky that my father (her first husband) had already passed away because it was also going to be *my* first cruise, and I would've *absolutely insisted* that my dad come along too.  You know, because it wouldn't be fair to deprive *me* of that experience.\n\nNTA.
