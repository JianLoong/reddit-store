Amicable split, remained cordial for our son. Ex-husband would fly from out of state for a week over Christmas break to see him. He always stayed at my parents house. No big deal to me. I didn't live there and our son was happy. Except that one year we were all together. Very awkward and uncomfortable for the person I was in a relationship with at the time.\n\nAfter our son graduates H.S. he moves 1525 miles away to live with his dad and start a career. Everything is going great. I remarry in 2020. Everything is going great. Now I bring you to last week. \n\nParents are celebrating their 40th Anniversary in Dec. 2024 and they have picked out a cruise and have an open invitation for family and friends to celebrate. Everyone pays their own fare. I get the info to select a cabin and am ready to make a down payment. Phone rings, it's my mom with GREAT news! My son has asked his father to be his roomie. She is thrilled and all she can talk about is everyone being together. I'm like meh. I think about this for hours after we hang up. The more I think, the angrier I get. The decision is made to not join the family cruise. I inform my mother and she is pissed!!! She is defending the decision that she and my son made together. Never once thinking to reach out to my husband and I first to find out how we'd feel.\n\nMy husband of three years doesn't know my sons father. And the thought of hanging out with his wife's ex-husband isn't exactly his idea of a good time. My ex-husband isn't a bad guy. But I divorced him for a reason and the thought of spending five days with him makes me cringe. Yes, I know it's a cruise ship and there's lots to do, but if I want to do something with my son, his dad will most likely tag along. I can't make this make sense.\n\nDo we go and suck it up? Or should I invite my mom's ex-husand (my dad) and his lady friend to join us? \ud83e\udd23", "created_utc": 1697038008, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/175grck/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_on_a_family_cruisewith/", "score": 867, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's possible your mom never even thought that it would bother you and your husband.  NTA.", "NTA.  But if you do go, it should be with your dad and his GF.  Sounds like fun right mom?", "NTA\n\njust don't, this is a train wreck waiting to happen. \n\nMake it clear if your ex is going you and your husband are not.", "NTA.\n\nI understand your point of view: Divorced him for a reason. Obviously, your mother still thinks he's a part of her family, while your partner is... not.\n\nOh, and, please tell me what she said to you inviting your dad and his lady friend to the cruise. I mean, it's fair play, it's an open invitation, she should not have a problem with that, right? (I understand you would not invite him, but that your mother does not know, right?)", "NTA- it\u2019s one thing to have the ex over for holidays. My parents did this as well, and it was great for all the kids, and now all the grandkids. No one ever had to choose. Over time, my dad and mom\u2019s husband hang out and chat at these things. And when grandkids were born my parents would carpool together to my sister\u2019s to help out. So- in terms of the long game, you are doing really well. \n\nHowever, my dad would jump overboard if he was trapped on a cruise ship with my mother\u2019s husband. I get how your parents just assume everyone gets along so why would this be an issue, but it is more a kind of controlling wishful thinking than reality.", "NTA - I don't care how big the ship is, I couldn't stand being on it with my ex. I'd tell your mom that you'll take her and her hubs out for dinner when they get back. If she throws a fit, THEN say So you'd be ok with me inviting dad (her ex) and his girlfriend? She might understand your position then.", "NTA\n\nWhy would she even do this?  Just wow.", "NTA.  Your mother has decided that your ex is more important than you.  Time to cut contact with her and move on with your life.", "NTA Look, inviting your dad would just be petty retaliation. Toss that idea if you were actually serious. \n\nI get not wanting to spend that much time with your ex. Believe me I do. But a cruise ship is huge. You\u2019ll see him a few times at most. A dinner or two. If you decide to go, talk to your ex about it openly and honestly and let him know you\u2019re uncomfortable and why, and discuss having time with your son where your ex goes to the casino or something. \n\nYour mom absolutely should have consulted you first. I tried to let my ex stay close to my family and in concept, that made sense until she kept being toxic and I no longer could allow it. You said you\u2019re amicable. This trip could actually work and you can demonstrate coexistence to your son.", "NTA. 2001 is a lifetime ago. Your parents should have known better. This is worse than being stuck with someone until the kids are 18.", "NTA. Don\u2019t go. I can\u2019t imagine your ex giving you and your husband quality alone time with your son. This trip does not sound relaxing at all. Just say no.", "Make your stand and don\u2019t go or you mother and son will never understand the reasoning. Your ex should have said no he wouldn\u2019t go because it might make you uncomfortable. He\u2019s been getting away with it for years and a precedence was set. Hard to get out of that one but by not going maybe they\u2019ll get a clue. Sorry you\u2019ll miss the cruise.", "NTA\n\nI'm not sure how your son or mom both think this is a good idea.", "NTA. No.", "YTA. Your son is now an adult, you can just \"let's do xyz, just the two of us\". Your ex can find something else to do.   \nHe's your ex. You're remarried. Your parents clearly still see him as family. This is a you problem to get over.   \nI say this as someone who's ex-husband talks to my mom weekly, and goes to see her to help set up her electronic equipment. We still celebrate holidays with them and our kids. Any new partners just know this going in. Would I love to cut ties with the ex? Yeah, but it isn't going to happen. Learn to live with it.", "ESH. They should have talked to you first but it seems like you guys have been amicable and divorced for over 20 years. Your son made the invite so obviously he wants to spend the trip with both of you. It\u2019s only weird if you make it weird. One of the best part of adulthood has been my divorced parents finally being able to do stuff together without the drama. They\u2019re just over it and it\u2019s nice. What will you do if your son has kids and wants to include you both on future trips? Parties? Events?

I say this as a child of divorced parents. It is so exhausting having to manage your relationship with your parents and then manage their relationship with each other. \n\nI\u2019m engaged and I\u2019m seriously considering eloping because I don\u2019t want to deal with the stress of my parents in the same room because of incidents (\u201cI\u2019m not going if he/she goes\u201d) and comments (\u201cI don\u2019t even know why X wants to go\u201d) like yours. \n\nThe way you react now will determine the decisions your child makes in the future. It is clear that your ex husband clearly has no problem being around you and unless there was something else going on (like abuse, cheating, etc) I really think you ought to learn to suck it up lest your child use this as the basis of their decisions moving forward. From your post, it doesn\u2019t look like your ex has done anything terrible, doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s been taunting you. His presence just makes for awkward situations and if that is the case, learn to get comfortable being uncomfortable. \n\nThe only person who\u2019d be missing out is you (and new hubs I suppose). You and your spouse have decided not to go on a trip because of someone else\u2019s presence\u2026.and that person hasn\u2019t even done anything terrible to you besides divorce you which sounds like a (good) joint decision. \n\nYou made a decision to marry someone when things were good, then they weren\u2019t so good and you split up. The problem is that time has passed, you both share a child, and whether you like it or not you\u2019re attached to each other for the rest of your lives. Divorce doesn\u2019t mean someone stops being family, just means you might treat them a bit differently. \n\nStop letting the mere presence of someone else ruin the relationships you\u2019re making with others. If you don\u2019t want your ex on trips you\u2019re on, that can be the standard going forward. For this trip, I suggest you suck it up. Cruise ships are huge, you\u2019ll only have to see your ex if you want to and MAYBE if y\u2019all choose to have a family dinner. \n\nGo on vacation, have fun, swallow your pride (if that\u2019s what this is), and if there are underlying reasons you don\u2019t want your ex around communicate those. The people that love you will be willing to make the accommodation for you, but they can\u2019t do anything if they don\u2019t know there\u2019s a problem.", "YTA, they view your ex as family, because he's tbe father of your grandchild.

Like, the kids (who were 3 and 5 at the time) were going to be deprived if their father wasn't there or something.  Absurd.  Now, my mother was lucky that my father (her first husband) had already passed away because it was also going to be *my* first cruise, and I would've *absolutely insisted* that my dad come along too.  You know, because it wouldn't be fair to deprive *me* of that experience.\n\nNTA.

The ongoing \u201chosting\u201d setup has clearly paved the way for the cruise(s), which honestly, isn\u2019t much more of a stretch. I\u2019d be so uncomfortable with an ex staying at my parents\u2019 house, but you said you felt this was fine? Even once your son was older?\n\nYour mother is peculiar to not see the conflict on her own. I\u2019d say it needs pointing out in concrete terms at this stage. Especially with a pattern emerging with the cruises. Dancing around the subject is no longer going to cut it. Your mother has no natural bounds, so you need to outline them. 2 things have changed: 1. your son is no longer a young child, and 2. you have remarried. The latter is especially significant and should be respected.\n\nI\u2019d definitely mention the prospect of inviting your father, to demonstrate the comparison to her. If she feigns having no problem with that, then absolutely invite your Dad and his partner. Follow-through is the key here. She\u2019s more than pushed it as it is.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to rub along with your ex, but to be pushed out of your family in favour of him is unacceptable. What\u2019s going to happen if your husband remarries? Will your mom prioritise invites for him and the new wife to family occasions over you and your husband? Taken to its natural conclusion, it could get rather ridiculous!\n\nRegardless of what happens, I would go on the cruise out of pure obstinacy. It\u2019s your family, don\u2019t let your ex\u2019s presence put you off. He\u2019s a guest in YOUR family now. The cruise is also an important opportunity for you to make your husband\u2019s presence be felt within the family dynamic, and allow him (and you) time to bond with your son.

But\u2026 you divorced 22 years ago, and you\u2019re still carrying this animosity?  Time to let it go and move on. Life is too short.\n\nMy ex dumped me 30 years ago, and I carried a LOT of anger for years.

Had an absolutely wonderful time.", "NTA. And sorry, but not only is your mother the AH here but so too are your ex and your son.

He needs to grow up. I think it was bad enough that he stayed with your parents at Christmas each year when he could have had a nice 1 :1 visit with his son, but this is beyond the pale.

You can\u2019t plan something else with your son outside of the cruise?  I hope it\u2019s just unfortunate wording, but it seems like you don\u2019t care much you haven\u2019t seen him in years and you don\u2019t care to make an effort.", "You\u2019re an adult. Hes an adult. I truly don\u2019t understand what the big deal is if you\u2019ve been cordial. Also just a question and I\u2019m not trying to be rude so I apologize if it comes off that way.

It just wouldn\u2019t happen here. The child would be told no, it\u2019s not happening and that\u2019s the end of it.

My parents divorced when I was nine. My mother married my step-dad after he told her he had orders to Germany for five years (Air Force.) For us to be able to go with him they had to be married at least six months. So it all happened so fast. Funny thing is my bio-dad, my mom and step-dad went to high school together! My mom and step-dad were high school sweethearts. After graduation he left for the Air Force. Meanwhile my mom has married and I come along. My mom and step-dad never lost touch. He came back to my hometown to visit family and of course he came over to see my mom. He gave me two bucks and sent me down to 7-11. I ain't dumb. My mother cheated. My bio-dad cheated, my step-dad cheated. My childhood wasn't pretty and into adulthood it hasn't been pretty. I love my mom, but I do not like her. I do not trust her.

I won't be able to spend time with son without his father. And Mom, imagine I booked a cruise for my 40th birthday and invited Dad and his new wife.

I am afraid I won't have any time to spend with you without your father. The last time I did something like that I was very uncomfortable.  However, I would like to get together with you when you get back.\"", "The son is probably in his early 20s and would rather his dad be there than invite a friend, if your child wants you there that badly you should make an effort to go. \n\nIf I was OP I would go and I would find it to be a red flag if my new partner didn\u2019t want to go bc my child\u2019s father is there.

But I feel like it also means that your son obviously can't spend a lot of time with both you and his dad - he must live far from at least one of you. So while it's no one's first preference for their ex to be on a family cruise, maybe you can live with it for your son. Maybe not, it's up to you. But I don't think it was awful of your mom to invite her grandson's father.\n\nETA I mean your son either doesn't see you often or doesn't see his dad often, not that it's important to spend with you together", "Wow. Stone cold", "Yeah I don't know what she's thinking, really. Sorry that you're in such an awkward situation. It seems your son seems to be on board with all this.

Imagine being reminded, at every meal and outing for five days, that your ex is more important to your family than you are.", "It\u2019s sad you haven\u2019t seen your son in 2.5 years. Is there any chance your son is hoping that you and the ex will get back together?", "Isnt your son old enough to be considerate of his parents?", "So your son knows his dad is mature enough to be willing to be cordial for a few days, and that his mom isn't. Seems fair to invite them both, and let them make their decisions.", ">I don't think he realizes how it would make me and my husband feel.\n\nOh he most likely does, he probably just has this broken vision of reality where \"eventually mom and dad will come to their senses and get back together\" \n\nHave a friend who is up in his forties still trying to get his mum and dad to love eachother again. Took basically the entire friendgroup to let him know that trying to break up his fathers new marriage is not something normal people do.", "LOL you should totally do it and tell her he's already booked since he's super excited to both go on a cruise and see his grandson as well. It's an open cruise, it's not like she can refuse to allow him to come and she can't argue he isn't allowed to see his daughter and grandson either can she?\n\nOh wait, she can.\n\nIf you want to take the extra petty road, go ahead and book it for you and your husband. Find out all the stops and excursions and research the hell out of what YOU want to do. Schedule ONE event with your mom to celebrate her anniversary and one specific event with your son with the expectation to tolerate your ex. The rest of the time schedule it for yourself and your husband and particularly make note of where you are located and see about specifying particular cabins away from them to avoid interactions as much as possible.", "I mean she needs to Take that up with her son. Her son asked the dad. They\u2019re divorced yes but he\u2019s still a father.\n\nBut again, the real AH is the mom. She could\u2019ve politely refused the dad if she considered OP\u2019s feelings.", "It\u2019s the ex wife that doesn\u2019t want him to go. The red flag is that the ex husband wants to go.

Yes, though, the mom is more of an AH. If the ex were nice he'd have asked OP if she minded. Reading some comments by OP, though, she remembered that the mother, son, and ex had gone on a cruise before and OP said no because she didn't want to spend time in close quarters with the ex. So, really AH behavior to set it up again knowing OP wouldn't want to join. However, now that I'm thinking about it more, OP's probably dodging a bullet by not having to go on any cruise in the future. She can do other vacations with her son and skip the mom and ex cruises.", "It\u2019s very sad that you think going to an event your child specifically asked you to go to is a red flag.\n\nI\u2019ll never understand how someone can have a kid with someone, separate, and then be shocked and appalled that the kid still wants to see both of their parents at the same time, especially at big family gatherings. The only red flag thrown is for OP being incredibly childish. \n\nHating your ex more than you love your kid is pretty awful and will only lead to a strain on your relationship with your kid.", "I hope you are right.", "She's willing to not go on a cruise because her son also wants his dad to not be able to enjoy it. She's seen him once in 20 years. \n\n\nShe has every right not to go, but she's the one missing out. There's nothing wrong with him being invited.\n\n\n\nWhat's she going to do if her son has a wedding? Kids?", "Ur talking absolute shite. The op hasn\u2019t suggested that she doesn\u2019t want her kid to see her ex. She\u2019s also said she doesn\u2019t hate her ex.

You\u2019re right that there isn\u2019t anything wrong with him being invited but i think that her son still could have brought it up with her to get her thoughts on it since it seems like she mostly feels a bit hurt that they just invited him and sprung it on her. Like her son isn\u2019t wrong but he also could have considered her more. Idk I\u2019m not firmly on anyone\u2019s side I just feel like vacation is different than like big events like weddings, and even with kids, you can always have multiple family gatherings.", "A wedding definitely is often a multi day thing for family of the couple, and involves more time spent together. A cruise ship is huge, they don't have to spend any time together. \n\n\nHe doesn't have to consider her feelings more than he considers his Dad's feelings. Her hatred for her ex is more than the love for her family.", "I\u2019ve literally been part of my step-sisters wedding and the bridal party - our father was barely part of it and was involved for like 2 days maximum. (Our parents are divorced and she\u2019s closer with her mom). \nHow is bringing it up with his mom considering her feelings more than his dad? That would be equal consideration - talking to them both. If anything, he is only considering his dad here since no one thought to give anyone a heads up until the MIL mentioned it to the mom for funsies."]}
