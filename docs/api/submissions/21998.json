The majority of my siblings are adopted into good families but I\u2019m one of the few who aged out.

I have decided to change my birth name to something I find more suitable for myself and because I do not want to be associated with my mother\u2019s activities while looking for a job after recently graduating. Recently, I went to a family gathering where multiple people confronted me on my mother\u2019s side of the family telling me how they do not like my new name etc. and how I should have never changed it.

Am I the asshole?\n\n\n\nUPDATE: Thank you so much for everyone\u2019s kind words. It means more than you know. I only went to the family gathering because my aunt has stage 4 cancer and I love her very much. She was good to me but didn\u2019t have the financial means to help me because she was in a DV situation. I went to the gathering to be there for her. Normally I do not associate with my family on either side. I appreciate everyone\u2019s kindness and helping me to validate my experience. I\u2019m still trying to unlearn being a people pleaser. I was looking for a sense of family because it is so hard to grow up in the system but I now realize that with family like that there\u2019s no point in having a \u201cfamily.\u201d Thank you for all the kindness.
