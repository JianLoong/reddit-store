I\u2019m a recovering people pleaser from associated traumas with my family and I really appreciate you guys helping me to validate my experience with this. My name is a cultural name as well and so my family is using \u201cerasure\u201d of my culture as the excuse for me not to change it as well.

LOL\n\nAnyways, that story popped into my head after reading the people who let you age out in foster care want you to keep the family name. Ridiculous. Fuck those people. My son has a really awesome name that has nothing to do with those people, and your new name will be awesome too. Free yourself, you got this!!!!", "NTA you should have changed it before you graduated so the name would match your degree name. \n\nDont bother with family gatherings on her side of the family - and dont update them on your life.
