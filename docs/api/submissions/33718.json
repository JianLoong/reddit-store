{"id": 33718, "submission_id": "18r0zdj", "title": "AITA for snapping at my stepsiblings and telling them to just go live full time at their mom's?", "selftext": "I live full time at my mom's, my stepdad has 3 kids (2 boys 1 girl) who split time pretty evenly between his and their mom's place. About 3 days ago they came over for I believe the next 3 weeks. When they are over me and my stepsister share a room. I Really don't want to sound like I'm spoiled but I HATE when they come over. They're loud, annoying and always cause a stupid amount of commotion.\n\nI think 2 days ago tho, we were all in the living room, I was reading while a movie was playing. Just like always I heard some sort of commotion and when I looked up the 2 boys were full on wrestling on the floor. I didnt mind it too much but the thudding was causing the floor to shake (we were upstairs). I was already getting annoyed but then my stepsister turned the volume up to a stupid loud volume to tune them out which made it almost impossible to focus on my reading. Then while the 2 were rough housing they full on stumbled right on top of me.\n\nTo their credit when they got off of me they did apologize and IK they didnt mean it but I was PISSED, I cussed them out pretty hard. My stepsister tried to chime in telling me to calm down and I snapped at her too cause she turned the volume up way more than needed. The 2 stepbrothers didnt say much but my stepsister got pretty pissed and clapped back at me. After like 30 seconds I realized I was getting more heated than I needed too and just walked away. While I was walking away to our room I said something like \"How about you guys just go live with your mom full time; fuck\".\n\nAfter that I didnt hear from either till around bed time when my stepsister came in. I didnt say anything to her but she called me a \"Fucking bitch\" and went straight to bed. My 2 stepbrothers dont really care what I said but I dont even think they were paying attention to anything I said but my stepsister is ignoring me hard. Like flat out won't answer me if I ask her specifically a question.\n\nSo I'm curious now AITA?\n\nEDIT:I know its gonna get asked and I forgot to put it in, but my mom and stepdad were on a dinner date when the whole situation happened so they didnt know about it.\n\nEDIT 2:It won't let me comment, but for ages, me and my stepsister are 16 and the boys are 13 and 14.

There were other actions you could have taken and you could have tried to find a solution.  You didn\u2019t even ever tell her the music was too loud for you to concentrate before becoming irate and it probably looked like you was mad at her first something the boys did.  She had no right to call you names and you shouldn\u2019t have basically wished them away.  Whether you like it or not you are a blended family and you need to speak with your parents or have a family meeting before this all turns into hatred, loathing etc. What if when they grow up if they have guidance they turn into lovely people ?  At this point everyone is being a problem and nobody is working towards solutions or resolution.  There doesn\u2019t even seem to be any discussion or compromising.", "YTA Ffs, they were rough housing do they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to see their dad? And all she did was turn it up. How evil can that really be. Go read in your room.", "YTA you could have left the room easily and they aren't visitors they live there too. Part time sure but they still are residents of that house and not guests. \n\nAdd to that they only get to see their father occasionally and you want them to just never see him? Rude. Go live with your father when they are there if it's that annoying"]}
