About 3 days ago they came over for I believe the next 3 weeks. When they are over me and my stepsister share a room. I Really don't want to sound like I'm spoiled but I HATE when they come over. They're loud, annoying and always cause a stupid amount of commotion.\n\nI think 2 days ago tho, we were all in the living room, I was reading while a movie was playing. Just like always I heard some sort of commotion and when I looked up the 2 boys were full on wrestling on the floor. I didnt mind it too much but the thudding was causing the floor to shake (we were upstairs). I was already getting annoyed but then my stepsister turned the volume up to a stupid loud volume to tune them out which made it almost impossible to focus on my reading. Then while the 2 were rough housing they full on stumbled right on top of me.\n\nTo their credit when they got off of me they did apologize and IK they didnt mean it but I was PISSED, I cussed them out pretty hard. My stepsister tried to chime in telling me to calm down and I snapped at her too cause she turned the volume up way more than needed. The 2 stepbrothers didnt say much but my stepsister got pretty pissed and clapped back at me. After like 30 seconds I realized I was getting more heated than I needed too and just walked away. While I was walking away to our room I said something like \"How about you guys just go live with your mom full time; fuck\".\n\nAfter that I didnt hear from either till around bed time when my stepsister came in. I didnt say anything to her but she called me a \"Fucking bitch\" and went straight to bed. My 2 stepbrothers dont really care what I said but I dont even think they were paying attention to anything I said but my stepsister is ignoring me hard. Like flat out won't answer me if I ask her specifically a question.\n\nSo I'm curious now AITA?\n\nEDIT:I know its gonna get asked and I forgot to put it in, but my mom and stepdad were on a dinner date when the whole situation happened so they didnt know about it.\n\nEDIT 2:It won't let me comment, but for ages, me and my stepsister are 16 and the boys are 13 and 14.

There were other actions you could have taken and you could have tried to find a solution.  You didn\u2019t even ever tell her the music was too loud for you to concentrate before becoming irate and it probably looked like you was mad at her first something the boys did.  She had no right to call you names and you shouldn\u2019t have basically wished them away.  Whether you like it or not you are a blended family and you need to speak with your parents or have a family meeting before this all turns into hatred, loathing etc. What if when they grow up if they have guidance they turn into lovely people ?  At this point everyone is being a problem and nobody is working towards solutions or resolution.  There doesn\u2019t even seem to be any discussion or compromising.", "YTA Ffs, they were rough housing do they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to see their dad? And all she did was turn it up. How evil can that really be. Go read in your room.", "YTA you could have left the room easily and they aren't visitors they live there too. Part time sure but they still are residents of that house and not guests. \n\nAdd to that they only get to see their father occasionally and you want them to just never see him? Rude. Go live with your father when they are there if it's that annoying", "YTA. You've been spamming different subs with this story for the last couple of days. You're obviously not happy with the responses you are getting and hoping someone will say you were in the right.", "YTA\n\nGo read your book elsewhere if you wanted to be left alone. You were snappy and shit, and when you realised you were losing the verbal fight you just went 100%.\n\nYTA\n\n> Like flat out won't answer me if I ask her specifically a question.\n\nSucks doesn't it, why are you asking questions when you told her to get lost?", "YTA if you are that bothered go to live full time with your dad.", "ESH. The boys are beyond old enough to know that rough-housing belongs outside. I got yelled at and spanked when I was a little kid for it. Stepsister turning the volume up was unnecessary, and since the boys are HER brothers, SHE should've told them to knock it off. As for you, I get that you're frustrated and don't like them, but your outburst, especially at the boys since they apologized, was out of line. You had other options, like calling your mom, going to a different room, putting headphones on, asking your stepsister to deal with her brothers, etc.\n\nYou burned a bridge. You can't expect people to talk to you when you fuck up like that.\n\nNow, you go apologize. You tell your mom and stepdad what happened. Accept that you fucked up and own it. Learn from it. And for God's sake, get into therapy.", "I have no idea why your step sister doesn\u2019t tell her dad she\u2019s uncomfortable with you because you said this sh\u2019tty thing to her. Honestly, I would tell my dad if he wants to ever see me again he has to do something about this.\n\nYTA and insufferable.", "YTA\n\nYou're 16 years old reading in a joint living area. It's not just yours and you could have easily moved to the bedroom if they were bothering you.\n\nA simple hey, can you guys calm down a little bit so it's not as loud, I'd appreciate it. Then to stepsister you could've asked kindly for her to turn it down.\n\nThere was no need for you to make that comment. You should be grateful that your stepsister didn't say anything to her father. They DO live there and have residence there when it's your stepdads time to have them. \n\nHaving some more communication would definitely help and if they don't settle down then just pick up and go to another place. I hope you apologize to your stepsister and stepbrothers and also let your mom and stepdad know what happened.", "You need to find a constructive way to deal with your situation. Saying hateful things isn't going to improve anyone's behavior. If it's too loud or you might get your personal space invaded, remove yourself BEFORE you get pissed. You need to recognize the feelings you're having that are leading up to the pissed off point and DECIDE to do something differently. It's hurting your personal development to continue being angry. You don't want to carry that into adulthood. You're in a situation you didn't choose and probably can't choose something more desirable until you're 18. Do some research on ways to cope. You'll feel much better about yourself and your situation. Not going to say you are the A, but you know in your heart it's not right, even tho it feels justified.", "ESH - Dealing with relatives is hard. Especially when they break your routine, which it sounds like your step siblings do by splitting time between their parents. Your step brothers were AH's with their wrestling/noise, your step sister was an AH with the TV volume, and you were an AH by saying that they should live with their mom full-time. Your step sister is also an AH for the silent treatment.\n\nIMO, I'd recommend the following steps to hopefully move forward from this situation.\n\n- Explain what happened to your mom & step dad (assuming you trust them to listen to you)\n\n- Apologize to your step siblings in front of your mom & step dad\n\n- Accept that your relationship with your step siblings will be different because of this incident \n\n- If similar situations happen again, speak up early on. ie Asking step siblings to cut it out or turn down the TV volume \n\n- Lastly, find a quieter place to read where you can go to if communication with your step siblings doesn't work", "Whose house? Is it your mom\u2019s house or step father\u2019s house?", "YTA they were normal kid annoying, and you went nuclear. Why didn't you just leave when they were getting annoying?", "Okay: NAH.\n\nAll sounds like pretty typical childish behaviour, from you as well as from them.  You don't like having to share your room with your stepsister, and that sucks: your stepbrothers wrestle for fun in the living-room and landed on top of you, that's annoying: your stepsister plays music much louder than you'd like, that's annoying: you said something awful and immature, and you should apologise to them for that.\n\nWhere are your mom and stepdad in all of this? Fine, they were on a dinner date when this incident actually happened, but it's pretty clear your unhappiness (and to be clear, it's evident your stepsister is no happier about having to share a room with *you*)  has been going on for a while. \n\nYou need to talk to your mom and stepdad about what happened, about how unhappy you are, and don't forget to admit what you said to your stepsiblings. Blended families don't just \"happen\" by throwing four kids together and expecting them to be friends. The parents  have got to work at it, and it's no use blaming either you or your stepsister or your stepbrothers for not getting along when made to live together.", "YTA. Your step-siblings are nicer people than me. What makes you think you have the right to tell them not to live in their father's home? Are they supposed to be walking on eggshells simply because you think you have more rights to the house? You should consider living with your dad fulltime!", "YTA. You don\u2019t get to sit and read in the noisiest room in the house and then get mad when people make noise!", "Yta. Where is your dad in all this and how come you don't go visit him? \nYou were wrong to say that to the other kids. It's their dad's place too. They have just as much right to be in this house full time if they want. And not go to their mother's at all. Which would be how they should answer the meanness you showed them.", "ESH", "Info: why were you reading in the living room where they were trying to watch a movie?", "Yeah, that was an asshole thing to say and I think you should apologize", "YTA - you are spoiled and a brat, grow up", "NTA. If you had your own private space this wouldn\u2019t be an issue. The fact your step siblings come over and you\u2019re only private space (bedroom) is taken from you is utter bullshit. Don\u2019t have that many kids or marry someone with more kids than you can comfortably house.\n\nThe amount of YTA comments baffles me. I bet each one of them had their own bedroom growing up.

All them act bad, but why she wuld apologize when the stepsister call her a bitch?", "> Explain what happened to your mom & step dad (assuming you trust them to listen to you)\n\nWhat happened is 100% on OP though, so they won't.", "e.s.h.  applies when both parties are sort-of equally to blame. Not when one party behaves badly and the other fails to be perfect in their response. OP sat in a common area of the house to read; that doesn't obligated everyone else to be quiet around her, and she didn't even bother to ask them to be more quiet. Then the stepbrothers engage in pretty typical behaviour for their age, she continues to stew silently instead of telling to cut it out, it gets too much, they apologize. And she takes the opportunity to vent her frustrations (which have more to do with them coming to stay in her house, and that's assholish on its own, because it is their house too) and cuss out younger kids, which prompts their older sister to defend them. OP then company's her asshole status by saying an incredibly hurtful thing.\n\n  \nOP is YTA.\n\nThe sister on the other hand...called her names? After being very provoked? Not on the same level.", "Except OP wasn't justified to be extremely heated and frustrated with the noise; they were all in the living area, you can't plant yourself in a common area of the house and expect people to be quiet around you. They were engaging in fairly normal activities, they apologized when it got too much, OP didn't bother to ask them to be a bit more quiet and went straight to cussing them out and starting a fight.", "They were in the living room, a common area, it's not unheard of to read in your room.", "Retreating to a room that your step sister has full authority to walk into at any time when she is one of the people annoying you is not a long term solution. OP had an outburst because she has a private space that is taken whenever the steps come over. Although OP lost their cool the step siblings being at their mothers house is definitely OPs preferred living situation. She needs to talk to her mother but overall it is very obvious OP has super shitty parents. Who in their right mind would think two 16 year old girls sharing a room wouldn\u2019t be at each others throats??", "Op could have used words. Hey stepsister I\u2019m going into the bedroom because I want quiet to read this book.  Then ask if you could have the room for an hour by yourself.  It sucks that you have to share a room but it is what it is and you are old enough to deal with it.  Although judging by your behavior described in the post you might not have the maturity usually seen in 16 year old."]}
