You also showed up for your friend and they will remember your kindness long after you forget what you did.\n\nThank you for being an ally.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry this happened. Especially in this day and age!! \n\nYou know.. it doesn\u2019t take much to be kind. Why does what someone does with their personal life bother so many people, to the point where others have to act so ugly?! If HALF the people that get so worked up over someone\u2019s personal s e x life and get worked up over say.. a charity or helping veterans or fixing world problems.. the world would be so much better off.", "Ofc NTA.

That's not down to you.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nBigots don't make up in their way.  They either double down, or go on like nothing ever happened because they do not believe they are wrong. So had you not stood up for your friend, he'd have made it worse or simply ignored the situation entirely making her likely feel the need to move to be away from him.

You\u2019ll probably be better off without him. He can take his bigoted views somewhere else.", "ESH- You could have talked to him, asked him to apologize.  Instead of allowing them to work it out you've made a closed minded person even more bitter and hateful. Nobody gained anything from this.", "I love gen Z for this.", "OP has no obligation to educate this homophobic dude. They stood up for their friend. Good job OP. NTA!", "Yeah, that's what I feared.", "Yeah, I'm a millennial, I like that the world's slowwwwwly getting it. Gen Z might actually break the curse... the most", "He alienated his other \"friend\" and had no obligation to do so either.", "No, the first priority in that situation is making sure your friend who was attacked feels safe and supported. That's more important than his feelings. It sounds like he didn't show signs of wanting to repair harm in the moment and simply letting him continue to sit there would have just made things worse for your friend. There's no deadline for him to do the right thing and try to make amends. He can still do that now but that's up to him.", "Why do you see it as your job personally to make him apologize? Are you the one to introduce him to the group?", "Yeah me too! 1984. There\u2019s hope for the future!! Although there\u2019s more and hate crimes now. I\u2019m from the Netherlands and I can walk around freely with my partner but there\u2019s so many stories of people getting beat up just for holding hands. It\u2019s not that progressive anymore unfortunately.", "Well, I\u2019m not having any homophobes in my friend circle either and I sure never will..", "No I guess not... Hmmm...", "I'll never understand that. I just literally can't *fathom* the thought process behind hating life choices enough to attack someone...", "That's fine that you choose that for your life. However, some people may want to educate and help their friends grow. These are teens, possibly not even adults yet. This ex-friend of his obviously has a narrow mindset and could use some help being more Considerate of others. Like I said, nobody gained anything from this. OP lost a friend, and said friend lost his entire friend group. His already narrow mind no doubt blaming the snow flake lesbian instead of his own poor choices. Driving him farther down the wrong road instead of correcting his path to one of tolerance.", "Yeah same here. But maybe it\u2019s exactly that. Thinking this is a life choice. I mean.. it\u2019s not a choice.", "I'm sure he can find like minded \"friends\" to spread his bigotry with. No one has to allow a hateful person to stay just in case \"they can be educated\". Quit trying to force disenfranchised people into \" educating\" the people who hate them without reason", "How is the OP \"disenfranchised\"? How does creating more bigotry help society? Sincere questions"]}
