De-escalating that kind of situation is *very* difficult, especially for peers.  He was being a bully, and the priority in dealing with a bully needs to be to protect the person being bullied by any means necessary, even if that means hurting the bully's feelings.  In that moment, making sure the victim feels safe and backed up is way more important than finding a teachable moment for the bully.
