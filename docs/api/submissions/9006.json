You also showed up for your friend and they will remember your kindness long after you forget what you did.\n\nThank you for being an ally.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry this happened. Especially in this day and age!! \n\nYou know.. it doesn\u2019t take much to be kind. Why does what someone does with their personal life bother so many people, to the point where others have to act so ugly?! If HALF the people that get so worked up over someone\u2019s personal s e x life and get worked up over say.. a charity or helping veterans or fixing world problems.. the world would be so much better off.", "Ofc NTA. Doesn't need an explanation", "NTA - Amazing job", "NTA \nYou coul reach out and explain if it bothers you.", "He can try and make up with the group any time he wants, but he hasn't. That's not down to you.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nBigots don't make up in their way.  They either double down, or go on like nothing ever happened because they do not believe they are wrong. So had you not stood up for your friend, he'd have made it worse or simply ignored the situation entirely making her likely feel the need to move to be away from him. You let him know that behavior isn't accepted in your group. That's a great thing.", "NTA.  Good for you", "Good for you! You put a homophobe in his place.", "NTA. You did the right thing. Proud of you.", "Why do you think you\u2019re the asshole?", "NTA- His homophobic to put it bluntly. You shouldn\u2019t feel bad for sticking up for a friend and honestly? You\u2019ll probably be better off without him. He can take his bigoted views somewhere else.", "ESH- You could have talked to him, asked him to apologize.  Instead of allowing them to work it out you've made a closed minded person even more bitter and hateful. Nobody gained anything from this.", "I love gen Z for this.", "OP has no obligation to educate this homophobic dude. They stood up for their friend. Good job OP. NTA!", "Yeah, that's what I feared.", "Yeah, I'm a millennial, I like that the world's slowwwwwly getting it. Gen Z might actually break the curse... the most", "He alienated his other \"friend\" and had no obligation to do so either.", "No, the first priority in that situation is making sure your friend who was attacked feels safe and supported. That's more important than his feelings. It sounds like he didn't show signs of wanting to repair harm in the moment and simply letting him continue to sit there would have just made things worse for your friend. There's no deadline for him to do the right thing and try to make amends. He can still do that now but that's up to him.", "Why do you see it as your job personally to make him apologize? Are you the one to introduce him to the group?", "Yeah me too! 1984. There\u2019s hope for the future!! Although there\u2019s more and hate crimes now. I\u2019m from the Netherlands and I can walk around freely with my partner but there\u2019s so many stories of people getting beat up just for holding hands. It\u2019s not that progressive anymore unfortunately.", "Well, I\u2019m not having any homophobes in my friend circle either and I sure never will..", "No I guess not... Hmmm...", "I'll never understand that. I just literally can't *fathom* the thought process behind hating life choices enough to attack someone...", "That's fine that you choose that for your life. However, some people may want to educate and help their friends grow. These are teens, possibly not even adults yet. This ex-friend of his obviously has a narrow mindset and could use some help being more Considerate of others. Like I said, nobody gained anything from this. OP lost a friend, and said friend lost his entire friend group. His already narrow mind no doubt blaming the snow flake lesbian instead of his own poor choices. Driving him farther down the wrong road instead of correcting his path to one of tolerance.", "Yeah same here. But maybe it\u2019s exactly that. Thinking this is a life choice. I mean.. it\u2019s not a choice.", "I'm sure he can find like minded \"friends\" to spread his bigotry with. No one has to allow a hateful person to stay just in case \"they can be educated\". Quit trying to force disenfranchised people into \" educating\" the people who hate them without reason", "How is the OP \"disenfranchised\"? How does creating more bigotry help society? Sincere questions", "NTA. You kept the peace, had your friend's back, and drew a hard line at a buttmunch.\n\nAs you also said, he's had a history of being mean, so honestly you're just second guessing yourself due to being a decent person.

If so, you did him a favor, too.", "NTA, not at all\n\nthis is a learning experience for everyone. \n\nHim, now he knows that not everyone will take his bullshit, and there are consequences to his actions.\n\nYour female friend, she now knows there are people that will stand up for her\n\nYou, now you know what it's like to stick up for someone, and if he did punch you, that would show more about him.

If he matures and has a change of heart, he can offer sincere apologies, but you're not obligated to pretend he's not a small-minded bigot.", "NTA....Good job!!!!", "NTA. \"Oh nooo, the consequences of your actions!\"", "NTA--- You did the right thing sticking up for her. Fascist suck, homophobes suck, racist suck... we should all be calling them out on their bad behavior. Keep that shit up.", "NTA. Societies tend to shun those with abhorrent behaviors.", "NTA", "NTA.  At all.  No excuse for homophobia.  He doesn't get to 'make things up his way.'  There's no making up calling someone a slur.

You not only are NTA, but you are very specifically the kind of person the world needs more of.\n\nAlso, taking all the gay/straight everything else out of this scenario ... you are standing up for your friend against a bully.\n\nAgain, that's HUGE and also something the world needs more of.", "Homophobes, like Nazis, do not deserve space. You did the right thing. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing. His language was not acceptable and you stood up for your friend who was called a hateful slur. The word is not \"racist\" because orientation isn't a race, but it's equivalent to racist and is very bigoted and hateful. Do not feel bad for essentially telling someone \"your bigoted and aggressively hateful words and views are not welcome here and you need to leave.\"", "NTA. Your decision to address a schoolmates toxic behavior is commendable. You stood up for a friend and bully boy couldn't handle it.", "Do you know what they call a table where one person tells a homophobic joke and 9 other people just sit there uncomfortably?  A table of 10 homophobes.\n\nYou followed the proper etiquette in situations like this.  NTA.", "NTA!!

They're still figuring things out.", "It would be one thing if he'd just made an offhand homophobic comment about something generic.  Then it might be worth trying the soft-hand approach and taking him aside for a quiet conversation.  However, he kicked this off with a snarky insult and then escalated to aggressive insults.  De-escalating that kind of situation is *very* difficult, especially for peers.  He was being a bully, and the priority in dealing with a bully needs to be to protect the person being bullied by any means necessary, even if that means hurting the bully's feelings.", "What does that have to do with anything?", "What was the point in bringing this up?", "He's using his powers for good instead of evil", "Lost your friends too, huh", "Oh, Jesus, terrible choice of words on my part. Yes, I absolutely agree", "You say that this will make him more bigoted as if it's a fact, but you don't know that. Maybe losing friends because of his bigotry will be a wake up call for him.", "His friend is. The one he defended. It's not our job to try to convince anyone their bigotry is wrong. They know they're wrong, they just don't care. I spent the better part of my life fighting for rights I shouldn't have had to fight for. If, in 2023, people still CHOOSE to be bigots, let them. It's not \"creating more bigotry\", it's refusing to accept bigots into our lives"]}
