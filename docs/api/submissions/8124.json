{"id": 8124, "submission_id": "10jysqd", "title": "AITA for telling my daughter that I'm no longer her father on the eve of her wedding?", "selftext": "I (M58) have a daughter Jackie (F24) who was married recently. Jackie's mother and I divorced when she was 2 and they settled in Texas while I'm in New York.  I also have a son Mike (M28).  Their mother married Joe (M70??) when Jackie was about 15. I don't have a particularly high opinion of Joe, but no real complaints about him either. Jackie always seemed lukewarm about him.\n\nDespite the distance, I visited every six weeks, would facetime my kids \\*minimum\\* one a week.  Paid all child support and supported and did anything else ever asked of me.  It was VERY expensive to do this, but I never balked, never complained.  I was there for every big event, and also any small event they ever asked me to attend.\n\nJackie was having a very big wedding and I contributed a lot of money towards it. As in more than half the budget.  At the rehearsal dinner, we were going over some of the discussions about the wedding and I brought up walking her down the aisle and the father daughter dance. Jackie got very silent and told me that she already asked Joe to do it.\n\nI said to her \"but I'm your father.\" She tells me she really appreciates how kind, loving and generous I had always been towards her but that she had to make a hard choice.  I tell Jackie that I feel unbelievably betrayed. I also feel very manipulated that she is springing this on me the day before the wedding. Especially after she had me pay the lion's share of the costs. I asked Jackie if she knew that I wouldn't be getting the father of the bride role when she took the money and she went dead silent.\n\nI told her that if I'm not her father at her wedding, then she can't call upon me to be her father elsewhere in her life. If I've spent 24 years doing the work, paying for college, paying for her wedding, flying all around the country and carrying all the freight of being a parent but at the biggest day of her life (her words), if she's pointing to another man as her father, then that's a life choice. Joe can take over paying for her law school tuition and that I'm changing my will to leave everything to Mike.  I'm willing to maintain a relationship, but it won't be a father-daughter relationship anymore.\n\nShe starts screaming at me how it is her wedding and it is her right to say who is a father to her and who isn't.  So I ask her \"So you are free to determine who is a father to you?  I can't stop you.  But if you can decide who is and isn't your father, then don't complain that I'm also free to   decide who is and who isn't my daughter.\"  She then told me I am a shit father for abandoning her on the eve of her wedding.  I told her that she was the one to announce a change to the relationship. She can't tell me I'm not a father to her and then have me continue considering her a daughter.  Also, she chose to announce all this on the eve of the wedding.\n\nSo, that's my story.  AITA?\n\nEDITS to answer common questions \n\n\\-- No, I didn't find it odd that there wasn't any discussion of it before the rehearsal dinner.  I've been in a few weddings, the instructions are usually pretty simple--stand here, walk out to this song and then go there.  Obviously wish I asked about it.  \n\n\\-- She never gave me a straight answer as to why she didn't choose me. Just that it was \"a hard decision, but it is her decision.\"  Some people ask if her mother might have pressured her.  I suspect that, as does my son, but ultimately I have no proof.\n\n\\-- Something I get a lot is that the relationship was all about money. Summing up a 24 year history and relationship as well as the actual conflict in 3000 words can't get everything.  I obviously can't teleport, so I can't have been in Texas every other weekend. But we talked all the time and about all of the things in her life.  Giving her advice on getting into law school (I'm a lawyer), talking about her relationships (she'd always ask me for my advice), telling me about her friends--everything.  It isn't like I was just paying child support and fucking off.", "created_utc": 1674540428, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jysqd/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_that_im_no_longer/", "score": 1649, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He doesn't know what kind of books I like, he doesn't know what kind of music I listen to. He wasn't there to ask me how my day was. He wasn't there for me when I needed him the most. There are just things that money can't buy. \n\nI didn't even have a step father to fill in the role but your daughter did, she had Joe. I personally feel like this is why your daughter sees Joe as her dad and not you. I do think she should have told you Joe would be the father of the bride on her wedding day, but you could have asked her sooner. \n\nIf you thought you would get a father daughter dance, would you not have discussed the song you would dance to and practiced the dance in advance? And like, not the day before her wedding?\n\nThis was an opportunity for you to see that you had created a transactional role for yourself in her life. And instead of actively trying to improving your relationship with your daughter, you cut her off completely. \n\nYou're an asshole for expecting her to see you as her dad when you weren't. And you're an asshole for cutting her off completely without trying to build a relationship with her that's not based on what you do for her financially. \n\nMy dad thinks that throwing money at me and calling once in a while is enough to cement his role as a father in my life and I believe this is a delusion you both share.", "NTA. Wow. What a left fielder she threw at you. I\u2019d also feel betrayed and hurt. I\u2019m sure you would have been OK if she asked to share the duties with Joe. But to completely exclude you from everything? That\u2019s heartless. You\u2019re literally not the father of the bride. I would have reacted the same.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry OP :( I feel hurt on your behalf. I wish Jackie had thought to ask both of you.", "ESH. \n\nYou clearly did everything you thought you could for your children. But the fact is that Joe was more physically present while you were more financially present. Maybe you needed to make harder/different choices, maybe nothing would have changed. \n\nBut your daughter *knowingly* deceived you. She knew that you, as her father, would pay for her wedding because that's what you've always done. She lied by omission by not being 100% transparent about your role in her wedding because she *knew* you did these things as her father. \n\nYou're both in the wrong for trying to police the feelings of the other. It's not wrong to be hurt by what she said, but she's not wrong to choose who walks her down the aisle.", "I get it when people say that contributing monetarily doesn't equate father duties. I get it really. But the daughter is a bigger asshole because she knew from the start that Joe will be walking her down. And still she used OP's money for her \"Biggest Day\". She is old enough to know that OP will assume what he did and that he would be expecting to walk her down. She kept mum deliberately so she can mooch off him. Child support is till kids are 18. OP wanted to be in his kids' life and he was in whatever capacity. \nBottomline is : Pay for your own wedding or make Joe pay for it, if you don't want your father i. It as your father.", "NTA", "ESH\n\nWaiting until right before the wedding to tell you her stepdad would be doing father of the bride duties while accepting your money to pay for the wedding was pretty underhanded of your daughter.\n\nWhile you certainly put the work in to make things work despite the distance, your children were absolutely never required to feel like that was enough. You reacted out of hurt instead of allowing the feelings to cool and having an actual conversation with your daughter.", "ESH. Your daughter because she let you pay so much toward the wedding when she knew you were expecting to walk her down the aisle but that she was having Joe do it instead. She knew it would hurt you, and was afraid you'd pull your financial contribution if she was honest at the beginning. That's beyond manipulative, it's deceitful. \n\nYou because while you really sound like you did a great job with being a long distance dad, you were still not the one who was there parenting her every single day. It's not fair that you aren't taking her feelings and experiences into account and trying to empathize. \n\nThat being said, I don't understand why you couldn't have both done it, one on each side.", "INFO (not that it matters much in the grand scheme of things, but I'm curious): You say you facetimed - I'm assuming that meant you used the alternatives before that was available - what did you do the years before that was even an option?", "NTA She was very manipulative to not tell you this until the day before the wedding. She absolutely knew what she was doing. She got what she needed from you before she told you that you weren't going to be the father of the bride. If she had told you in advance, I would have had more respect for her decision.", "Your daughter doesn\u2019t owe you for doing the bare minimum.  I haven\u2019t seen any emotion about why you want to be by your daughters side, other than you expected that role.  Is it for appearances?  Do you have something to prove to the wedding guests?  Or is it that you are so close that you are wanting to be there for her emotional support on her big day because you are the person who could best provide that.  Money doesn\u2019t calm wedding jitters or tell a funny story from childhood or tell the bride how beautiful she looks.  Are you the person who can do that for her or are you just wanting the role for selfish reasons.\n\nI\u2019m going to have to go with YTA.  She didn\u2019t spring anything on you if you never talked about it, and again that\u2019s a big sign that you weren\u2019t close enough to help her plan her day if you were so in the dark.  You behaved like a bank and have been treated like a bank.  What would have made her think you would have wanted it to be any different?", "NTA.  Just don't change your mind when she comes back crying and apologizing after the honeymoon, because she will probably try to return things back to normal and will pretend to be remorseful.", "Info: you saw your ex and Joe got married when daughter was 15, but how long had he been in their lives?", "NTA, and boy does she suck - and sorry on that because I know you're hurt.", "NTA - she got entitled and then got bitten in the butt\u2026", "NTA I would of been just as upset as you were", "NTA you are simply following her lead because she told you how she expects the future of the relationship to go. Walk away go NC and she'll probably eventually be reaching back out crying I would take it with caution", "NTA", "NTA", "Nta", "Sometimes I read these things and I want to hear from the other person. I think you probably reacted out of hurt and what your daughter did was beyond underhanded. She played on your love for her for money. That speaks to very poor character. But as for choosing the SF over the father, I'd at least like to hear the reason.\n\nYou're right to feel hurt and can process that however you want.", "YTA. You sound awfully proud of yourself for doing the bare minimum as a parent\u2014the financial support you\u2019re legally entitled to pay, along with the occasional phone call. In fact, I\u2019d even say you sound downright resentful that you had to do that. Like you are annoyed you were paying all those years for upkeep on a property that didn\u2019t bring in income, or something. \n\nYou describe your relationship with your daughter in mostly transactional terms. Where were you actually parenting? Did you calm her fears when she was going through puberty? Help her over her first heartbreak? Did you help with homework, or cooperate with her mom to celebrate her successes, or give her tough love when she needed it?\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder she treated you like a bank. You trained her to understand that\u2019s the only way you show up for her. It\u2019s obvious she really hurt your feelings, but it was a shitty to make her decision all about you. You might have responded by trying harder to be there for her, or to understand what you can learn from her stepdad, or even just waiting to talk about it with her when this stressful event is over. But it sounds like you just didn\u2019t feel you got your money\u2019s worth.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry for what happened to you.", "NTA \n\nThat's tough stuff, man.  I'm sorry to hear it.", "NTA.  Sounds like you did the best you could and she doesn\u2019t appreciate you as more than a checkbook.  Painful, but I admire your grace in the face of such pain.", "NTA. What a kick in the nuts, I can see why you're hurting. \n\nI do have two questions. You said the mother go remarried when Jackie was 15. How long had they been together before that? It would seem odd she formed a father-daughter relationship with Joe if it was particularly close to her 15th birthday that he came into her life.\n\nDidn't it strike you as a little odd that by the time of the rehearsal dinner you hadn't had any discussion about your role in the wedding? That would've been a warning bell for me.", "NTA. Your daughter used you and she dare blame you? She made her choice and you have every right to make yours. I\u2019m so sorry your daughter is such an ungrateful woman. I hope your son treats you better than this. Sending lots of love!", "NTA. Actions have consequences, and for Jackie to hide an information like this is intentional and dishonest. I just worry that you\u2019re going to regret it down the line.", "Going with NTA because they waited until the eve of the wedding to spring it on you. They wouldn\u2019t have done that unless they knew you would be hurt and they were hoping the pressure of the wedding being the next day would force your silent acquiescence. \n\nAlso her silence when you asked her if she knew this before she accepted your money. She knew what she was doing, she\u2019s just mad she\u2019s facing consequences.", "NTA, your only mistake was not going full NC with her", "NTA. My initial knee jerk reaction was that you should love your daughter unconditionally, but the same goes for your daughter in that she should love you unconditionally as well.  Accepting money for the cost of her wedding while she knew she wasn't going to have you walk her down the aisle is just plain sucky. She should have told you before you handed over the money.", "NTA - She made her bed, now she has to lay in it.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry man, that had to hurt. I think you got reasonably upset without going too far. Hopefully she comes to understand how you must\u2019ve felt and you two can make amends.", "NTA.  Guessing she's realised she's up shit creek without a paddle if Joe can't afford to pay for her law school, she'll have to work and get student loans.  You haven't been a deadbeat Dad, you've done a lot for her and unfortunately your former daughter has turned into a selfish entitled AH.  I can understand you would feel betrayed and don't blame you for your reaction one bit.  Just make sure you follow through with what you said you will be doing.", "NTA\n\nI would cancel everything. Yeah you might not get your money back but she wouldn\u2019t be getting that wedding unless the \u201cfather of bride\u201d paid for it! She knew exactly what she was doing.", "I could totally imagine the daughter having the attitude of \u201call dad\u2019s ever done is throw money at us in lieu of his presence so why shouldn\u2019t I take advantage?\u201d and then also feeling like it would be a betrayal of Joe as the emotionally present parent to not have him stand in as the father. \n\nNotice how OP\u2019s first response to hurt feelings is to relate it all back to money.", "NTA. You paid for most of the wedding, plus all the other sacrifices you made over the years.  She can\u2019t expect you to financially support her going forward.", "Hm. It feels like there\u2019s more to this story. Without additional context, it\u2019s hard to know whether she\u2019s really taking advantage of you or if there\u2019s a good reason she chose her stepdad to give her away. If this is truly how everything happened, you\u2019re NTA but you\u2019re also still her father, despite whatever you both yelled at each other, and she is quite young. I get the sense that she matters a lot to you and that you\u2019re not truly willing to end your relationship with her over this. If I\u2019m right, then you need to be the bigger person here because you\u2019re her father and that\u2019s your job. I think it\u2019s possible you don\u2019t understand her perspective and it might be worth it to hear her out.", "NTA. I didn\u2019t really have a relationship with my father. He paid child support, but that was forced by the government. Sometimes I would see him a few times a year. Sometimes I wouldn\u2019t see him for a few years. He didn\u2019t called me. I never got birthday presents or even cards from him. I might have talked to him once a year because I called him. I was getting married when I was 25, I sent an invitation to him and his whole side of the family. I didn\u2019t actually expect anybody to show up. My father called me a few days before the wedding saying he was going to come. I was shocked because we didn\u2019t live in the same state. It actually never occurred to me that he thought he would walk me down the aisle until the night before my wedding. I did feel bad and awkward letting him know so late. But there was no way he was going to walk me down the aisle when I could count on one hand, the number of times I had talked to him in the previous five years. It sounds like you\u2019ve been involved and loving towards your daughter. I\u2019m sure it was heartbreaking.", "NTA. OP sounds like he has been present throughout daughter\u2019s life and maintained a father/daughter relationship all along. Also, unless it was a very long courtship between Joe and Jackie\u2019s mother, Joe can\u2019t have been in Jackie\u2019s life for the formative years. At the very least, Jackie should have planned a long conversation well ahead of the wedding to break the news with the greatest tact. But honestly, you can\u2019t have another man walk you down the aisle and not expect your father to take it deeply personally.", "NTA that's unbelievably disrespectful and I can not imagine how hurtful it must have been. She's a grown woman and made her decision. You have every right to make your own as well. She outright deceived you into paying for the wedding. For your sake you should probably forgive sooner than later but that's still infuriating. Sorry mate, take care of yourself.", "Seem to be going against the grain but YTA\n\nI can absolutely understand why this scenario was immensely distressing and hurtful BUT you don\u2019t get to pull out of being a parent because your kid did something shitty.\n\nYes you get to feel hurt, yes you should be able to express that and potentially take some actions so you feel psychologically safe but You don\u2019t get to disown your kid because they seem to like someone more than you.\n\nPlacing financial expectations on relationships never ends well.

Jackie's mother and I divorced when she was 2 and they settled in Texas while I'm in New York.  I also have a son Mike (M28).  Their mother married Joe (M70??) when Jackie was about 15. I don't have a particularly high opinion of Joe, but no real complaints about him either. Jackie always seemed lukewarm about him. \n\nDespite the distance, I visited every six weeks, would facetime my kids \\*minimum\\* one a week.  Paid all child support and supported and did anything else ever asked of me.  It was VERY expensive to do this, but I never balked, never complained.  I was there for every big event, and also any small event they ever asked me to attend.\n\nJackie was having a very big wedding and I contributed a lot of money towards it. As in more than half the budget.  At the rehearsal dinner, we were going over some of the discussions about the wedding and I brought up walking her down the aisle and the father daughter dance. Jackie got very silent and told me that she already asked Joe to do it.  \n\nI said to her \"but I'm your father.\" She tells me she really appreciates how kind, loving and generous I had always been towards her but that she had to make a hard choice.  I tell Jackie that I feel unbelievably betrayed. I also feel very manipulated that she is springing this on me the day before the wedding. Especially after she had me pay the lion's share of the costs. I asked Jackie if she knew that I wouldn't be getting the father of the bride role when she took the money and she went dead silent. \n\nI told her that if I'm not her father at her wedding, then she can't call upon me to be her father elsewhere in her life. If I've spent 24 years doing the work, paying for college, paying for her wedding, flying all around the country and carrying all the freight of being a parent but at the biggest day of her life (her words), if she's pointing to another man as her father, then that's a life choice. Joe can take over paying for her law school tuition and that I'm changing my will to leave everything to Mike.  I'm willing to maintain a relationship, but it won't be a father-daughter relationship anymore.\n\nShe starts screaming at me how it is her wedding and it is her right to say who is a father to her and who isn't.  So I ask her \"So you are free to determine who is a father to you?  I can't stop you.

Set aside the daughter for a second, as I think it's clear she is wrong here, but something about OPs whole vibe doesn't sit right with me. Three main things jump out: 1) the whole nub seems monetary/transactional; 2) if you're that \"close\" with your child things like this don't get sprung on you... Even as an adult in my late 30s I try to speak to my parents weekly since we live super far away so I can't physically see them that often. If I was going to do something like this at my wedding, my parents would have known something was up; 3) and this is the one that strikes me as very odd, but it's the pettiness and childishness of OP being like \"you're not my daughter anymore\" and leaving the wedding... It's your only daughter's wedding, you paid for a chunk of it. It's fine to be hurt by the symbolic dig, but it seems like a massive overreaction.", "This! Being a parent is more than phone calls and paid bills.

I\u2019m not your father anymore? Call me by my first name?? That\u2019s so childish and honestly it shows that OP is the one who is viewing the relationship as transactional. Maybe she really is deceitful and whatever but crying and cutting her out of the will the day before the wedding instead of sharing with her afterwards that you were hurt by her actions and plan to set this boundary going forward is pretty messed up too.", "This!! OP sounds so transactional - there is so much more to relationships than money. Paying for things is a part of being a parent but it does not make you a father. Paying for a wedding does not buy you the right to a certain role. If you care so much, why didn\u2019t you ask about details of the wedding before showing up? Sounds like you signed the cheques and didn\u2019t take an interest in planning until you found out you don\u2019t have a starring role then you threw a tantrum.

I was thinking there has to be huge missing reasons why she wouldn\u2019t want bio dad to walk her. Yeah paying for shit is what you sign up for as a parent, divorced or not.

Lets see how much he lets her rely on him when it isn\u2019t someone else paying the bills.", "Right? Like I get hurt feelings that you didn't get the patriarchy prize at this wedding and weren't told until the last minute, but if this is the way he responds there's clearly a lot going on emotionally in both lives that isn't being dealt with very well.", "Unfortunately she announced it this late because  of its too late to cancel", "That\u2019s fine and understandable. I also have an absent father. I\u2019m a guy but if I was not going to have him assume the ceremonial role of my father, choosing someone else to do so at some important event, I would never have expected him to pay for it either.", "Read the rest of his responses and if you still think this way then you\u2019re full of shit.", "This is a really good, heartfelt response.  I agree with your conclusion.", "He isn't trying to \"police\" her feelings .

She has another person to squeeze for cash.", "Exactly, at least if she didn\u2018t marry rich. And it\u2018s all her own fault.", "We are getting a very one sided bias POV.\n\nThink... OP didn't bother to move closer to his children, left them with a woman he says was abusive, and is emotionally blackmailing his daughter over not choosing him.\n\nWith her reluctance it could be anything- manipulation from the abuser OP left her with, Joe could be sick (given his age) and this could be a private gesture of kindness, maybe Joe was more of a father figure to her in nine years than OP has been all her life. \n\nWe just don't know and frankly OP's attitude and anger over this feels like a massive red flag even with his biased storytelling.", "That's not how adults who were raised in abuse function. With a narcissistic parent many times they prioritize stabilizing the boat over a beneficial relationship, and will get angry at the person who says F this and leaves the boat.", "1. Perhaps she feels resentful that her father left her with her abusive mother and didn't fight for custody.\n\n2. Maybe her mother did hardcore parental alienation all her life, painting a nonexistent narrative of OP.\n\n3. Maybe OP has missing missing reasons as the portrait he's painting is that he's never done a single wrong thing in his life yet is willing to suddenly disown his own child.", "Her grown ass dad couldn\u2019t hack the moms abuse so I don\u2019t share your certainty.", "I got divorced in Texas and divorce courts (here) only \u201cdecide\u201d where your kids end up if you don\u2019t come to an agreement amicably or through mediation. And judges will very frequently only decide for you if you and your spouse can\u2019t act like adults.", "I\u2019m sorry you had that experience of a mother. Thank you internet stranger for the reminder to lead with kindness with my children and to continue to try to foster a genuine relationship between my kiddo and my ex-husband.", "It also assumes the wife was abusive towards the daughter which there\u2019s nothing indicating. OP was talking about his marriage, not the wife\u2019s parenting.", "Idk OP didn't mention fighting tooth and nail for custody. If his wife was verbally and otherwise abusive he should have collected evidence and done what he could to use in court to protect his children.", "I'd say nobody is ignoring that part except OP himself. the way he words it, she didn't ask for him to pay so much, he did it of his own will. he and everyone of you acts like she sugar babied him into paying for her wedding. if the act of him doing so (and still actively being in her life) was going to be contingent on the father daughter dance+walking her down the aisle, then imo it already feels like he's emotionally detached from the father role IRL.", "Again I don't get this. She didn't steal it? He gifted her money. He's only upset now that he can't walk her down the aisle. The fact she wanted her step dad to do it is fair imo. \n\nBut totally she should have talked about this with him earlier. \n\nSurely a father gifts his kid money because he loves her, without the requirement for her to love only him. Seems a bit callous to suggest she can only love *one* father figure, and/or she must love him the most?", "Posts like this make me want a post from the daughter/other party to get two sides and then I can extrapolate from both. Cuz I totally understand staying \u201cwhere the money is,\u201d for me it\u2019s hard cuz like my dad could\u2019ve gone back to his home state and still make good money, but he chose to stay close to us. So I need like way more info \ud83d\ude02 I\u2019m also nosey as hell so let\u2019s hear the dirt", "I would feel betrayed as well to this point. Disowing her is a stretch, but I would be furious. I would also leave the wedding because that is just a slap in the face too hard to stand. Fuck all your excuses, unless the father was abusive or did something horrid, she is a cold hearted \ud83e\udd27 for this", "I partly agree with this, but you don't know the circumstances from his side either. What if he's there taking care of his mother or something? And that still leaves the whole part where she decided not to tell him. He only found out because he asked, not because she told him. Presumably he would've found out during the ceremony? That's just asking for trouble.", "Emotional blackmail? She said herself \u201cit\u2019s her right to say who her father is\u201d. He merely agreed.", "OP didn\u2019t say the wife was verbally and emotionally abusive towards the daughter, he said they were fighting a lot in their marriage. There are a lot of relationships that are toxic or one person is abusive and yet the child is treated well by both parents.\n\nOP wasn\u2019t non-existent. He showed up at big and small events, helped the daughter get into the school she wanted etc. Clearly their relationship was more than just financial support.\n\nHe was thrown under the bus after being taken advantage of by his daughter, which is a huge slap in the face. So he\u2019s completely justified in \u2018suddenly disowning his daughter\u2019. His daughter just said she doesn\u2019t see him as her father so she\u2019s made it clear where she stands. \n\nWhy should OP continue to be used for money if the daughter doesn\u2019t want to consider him as her dad? Even if you strip it back to just financial support, he\u2019s done more than his time of supporting her. She\u2019s an adult and needs to take responsibility for her own finances. Most 24 year olds don\u2019t have someone else paying for their education and wedding for them", ">Maybe her mother did hardcore parental alienation all her life, painting a nonexistent narrative of OP.\n\nIf the mother is a narcissist that one is highly likely. They lie all the time.\n\nI would even consider 3, but taking all the money and then springing it on dad just makes her an AH.", "If OP did the best he could at being a dad and was as good as he says then I bet that growing up with a toxic mother is the issue here. If the daughter is an adult, doesn\u2019t make her immune from her mothers manipulation. The mother probably pressured the daughter into having Joe walk her down the aisle. Unfortunately mother has gotten what she wants, OP has abandoned his daughter and the mother gets to tell people OP was the bad guy all along. OP, make up with your daughter, set boundaries so you are not financially abused but try to see your ex as the bad guy and see if you can heal your relationship. Otherwise, I\u2019m betting that by time she sees her mother for what she is, both parents would have abandoned her.", "Thank you, these are good points. Especially #3. \n\nFree awards seem to be gone, take my poor person \"award\" \ud83c\udfc6", "If she rejects the father because she remembers him as an abusive asshole, then she doesn't get to also accept his money and pretend like everything is amazing as long as she needs things from him. If she wants to turn him away from her life, that's fine, but she can't be upset when he then withdraws support.", "But, the divorce wasn't in Texas. OP's post mentions his ex took the kids and \"settled\" there after the divorce. \n\nAdd in the timeframe, and it's much more likely that he made decisions based on which fights he could win and what he thought would most benefit the kids. Would have been hard to pay for all the extra visits, trips, school, etc if he bankrupted himself fighting an almost certainly losing battle for more custody. And, 20 years ago, no court in the US was likely to give full custody to a father without extreme proof of the mother committing physical abuse, sexual abuse, or extreme neglect. In addition, few courts would restrict the mother from moving or doing whatever she wants with the kids short of those extremes. \n\nNot trying to take a side, but how divorce and custody is handled has changed rapidly over the last few decades. When the time is taken into consideration, it's perfectly reasonable to believe that OP did the best he could with a crummy situation.", "Well, that requires a bipartisan agreement from both parents. Seeming as OP got absolutely shafted on the visitation rights, the Ex probably took it to divorce court. Divorce courts are infamous for favoring the mother in custody arrangements.\n\nMy first comment still stands.", "Verbal abuse against a man 2 decades ago ? The court would have laughed at him...", "Lol you're just as bad as the daughter. You think people just owe their children endless amounts of money and love for nothing in return? Even after theyre grown adults?", "Hah yeah, I'm waiting for the day where I see 2 anonymous AITA posts and manage to link them together as being from the same storyline.\n\nWonder if that's ever happened before?!", "It's not out of the realm of possibility but again, he didn't seem to fight to protect his kids from a person he knew was abusive. \n\nPlus he's a lawyer, so regardless of his field I don't believe he didn't know a good family law attorney.", "OP made an assumption that he would be rewarded with a role he hadn't necessarily earned if he paid for the wedding. He's a lawyer, he should have known to get it in writing before hand.", "Did he put a contract in place? was this a transaction in exchange for walking her down the aisle? no. \n\nHe chose to gift her money/wedding shit. No one forced him to. His monetary help has nothing to do with this. It's just his smoke screen that everyone is falling for. \n\nEnd of the day, it's her wedding. She chooses what she wants. OP was the AH for blowing up the day before her wedding.", "IT HAPPENS SO OFTEN omg or like the subject of the post comments and says \u201cthis is actually what happened\u201d I live for that shit", "That's the thing . While today things are getting better , 20 years ago the court decisions were not particularly equal . Not to mention , verbal abuse was  barely recognized as abuse at all at the time . As for what he did or didnt do , I'm really curious about how you seem to know what he did , considering that there is no mention of how the divorce and custody hearings went in this post at all...", "I'm relatively new here but, that'd actually be so juicy. \ud83d\ude02"]}
