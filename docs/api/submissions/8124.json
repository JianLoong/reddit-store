{"id": 8124, "submission_id": "10jysqd", "title": "AITA for telling my daughter that I'm no longer her father on the eve of her wedding?", "selftext": "I (M58) have a daughter Jackie (F24) who was married recently. Jackie's mother and I divorced when she was 2 and they settled in Texas while I'm in New York.  I also have a son Mike (M28).  Their mother married Joe (M70??) when Jackie was about 15. I don't have a particularly high opinion of Joe, but no real complaints about him either. Jackie always seemed lukewarm about him.\n\nDespite the distance, I visited every six weeks, would facetime my kids \\*minimum\\* one a week.  Paid all child support and supported and did anything else ever asked of me.  It was VERY expensive to do this, but I never balked, never complained.  I was there for every big event, and also any small event they ever asked me to attend.\n\nJackie was having a very big wedding and I contributed a lot of money towards it. As in more than half the budget.  At the rehearsal dinner, we were going over some of the discussions about the wedding and I brought up walking her down the aisle and the father daughter dance. Jackie got very silent and told me that she already asked Joe to do it.\n\nI said to her \"but I'm your father.\" She tells me she really appreciates how kind, loving and generous I had always been towards her but that she had to make a hard choice.  I tell Jackie that I feel unbelievably betrayed. I also feel very manipulated that she is springing this on me the day before the wedding. Especially after she had me pay the lion's share of the costs. I asked Jackie if she knew that I wouldn't be getting the father of the bride role when she took the money and she went dead silent.\n\nI told her that if I'm not her father at her wedding, then she can't call upon me to be her father elsewhere in her life. If I've spent 24 years doing the work, paying for college, paying for her wedding, flying all around the country and carrying all the freight of being a parent but at the biggest day of her life (her words), if she's pointing to another man as her father, then that's a life choice. Joe can take over paying for her law school tuition and that I'm changing my will to leave everything to Mike.  I'm willing to maintain a relationship, but it won't be a father-daughter relationship anymore.\n\nShe starts screaming at me how it is her wedding and it is her right to say who is a father to her and who isn't.  So I ask her \"So you are free to determine who is a father to you?  I can't stop you.  But if you can decide who is and isn't your father, then don't complain that I'm also free to   decide who is and who isn't my daughter.\"  She then told me I am a shit father for abandoning her on the eve of her wedding.  I told her that she was the one to announce a change to the relationship. She can't tell me I'm not a father to her and then have me continue considering her a daughter.  Also, she chose to announce all this on the eve of the wedding.\n\nSo, that's my story.  AITA?\n\nEDITS to answer common questions \n\n\\-- No, I didn't find it odd that there wasn't any discussion of it before the rehearsal dinner.  I've been in a few weddings, the instructions are usually pretty simple--stand here, walk out to this song and then go there.  Obviously wish I asked about it.  \n\n\\-- She never gave me a straight answer as to why she didn't choose me. Just that it was \"a hard decision, but it is her decision.\"  Some people ask if her mother might have pressured her.  I suspect that, as does my son, but ultimately I have no proof.\n\n\\-- Something I get a lot is that the relationship was all about money. Summing up a 24 year history and relationship as well as the actual conflict in 3000 words can't get everything.  I obviously can't teleport, so I can't have been in Texas every other weekend. But we talked all the time and about all of the things in her life.  Giving her advice on getting into law school (I'm a lawyer), talking about her relationships (she'd always ask me for my advice), telling me about her friends--everything.  It isn't like I was just paying child support and fucking off.", "created_utc": 1674540428, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jysqd/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_that_im_no_longer/", "score": 4074, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He doesn't know what kind of books I like, he doesn't know what kind of music I listen to. He wasn't there to ask me how my day was. He wasn't there for me when I needed him the most. There are just things that money can't buy. \n\nI didn't even have a step father to fill in the role but your daughter did, she had Joe. I personally feel like this is why your daughter sees Joe as her dad and not you. I do think she should have told you Joe would be the father of the bride on her wedding day, but you could have asked her sooner. \n\nIf you thought you would get a father daughter dance, would you not have discussed the song you would dance to and practiced the dance in advance? And like, not the day before her wedding?\n\nThis was an opportunity for you to see that you had created a transactional role for yourself in her life. And instead of actively trying to improving your relationship with your daughter, you cut her off completely. \n\nYou're an asshole for expecting her to see you as her dad when you weren't. And you're an asshole for cutting her off completely without trying to build a relationship with her that's not based on what you do for her financially. \n\nMy dad thinks that throwing money at me and calling once in a while is enough to cement his role as a father in my life and I believe this is a delusion you both share.", "NTA. Wow. What a left fielder she threw at you. I\u2019d also feel betrayed and hurt. I\u2019m sure you would have been OK if she asked to share the duties with Joe. But to completely exclude you from everything? That\u2019s heartless. You\u2019re literally not the father of the bride. I would have reacted the same.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry OP :( I feel hurt on your behalf. I wish Jackie had thought to ask both of you.", "ESH. \n\nYou clearly did everything you thought you could for your children. But the fact is that Joe was more physically present while you were more financially present. Maybe you needed to make harder/different choices, maybe nothing would have changed. \n\nBut your daughter *knowingly* deceived you. She knew that you, as her father, would pay for her wedding because that's what you've always done. She lied by omission by not being 100% transparent about your role in her wedding because she *knew* you did these things as her father. \n\nYou're both in the wrong for trying to police the feelings of the other. It's not wrong to be hurt by what she said, but she's not wrong to choose who walks her down the aisle.", "I get it when people say that contributing monetarily doesn't equate father duties. I get it really. But the daughter is a bigger asshole because she knew from the start that Joe will be walking her down. And still she used OP's money for her \"Biggest Day\". She is old enough to know that OP will assume what he did and that he would be expecting to walk her down. She kept mum deliberately so she can mooch off him. Child support is till kids are 18. OP wanted to be in his kids' life and he was in whatever capacity. \nBottomline is : Pay for your own wedding or make Joe pay for it, if you don't want your father i. It as your father.", "NTA", "ESH\n\nWaiting until right before the wedding to tell you her stepdad would be doing father of the bride duties while accepting your money to pay for the wedding was pretty underhanded of your daughter.\n\nWhile you certainly put the work in to make things work despite the distance, your children were absolutely never required to feel like that was enough. You reacted out of hurt instead of allowing the feelings to cool and having an actual conversation with your daughter.", "ESH. Your daughter because she let you pay so much toward the wedding when she knew you were expecting to walk her down the aisle but that she was having Joe do it instead. She knew it would hurt you, and was afraid you'd pull your financial contribution if she was honest at the beginning. That's beyond manipulative, it's deceitful. \n\nYou because while you really sound like you did a great job with being a long distance dad, you were still not the one who was there parenting her every single day. It's not fair that you aren't taking her feelings and experiences into account and trying to empathize. \n\nThat being said, I don't understand why you couldn't have both done it, one on each side.", "INFO (not that it matters much in the grand scheme of things, but I'm curious): You say you facetimed - I'm assuming that meant you used the alternatives before that was available - what did you do the years before that was even an option?", "NTA She was very manipulative to not tell you this until the day before the wedding. She absolutely knew what she was doing. She got what she needed from you before she told you that you weren't going to be the father of the bride. If she had told you in advance, I would have had more respect for her decision.", "Your daughter doesn\u2019t owe you for doing the bare minimum.  I haven\u2019t seen any emotion about why you want to be by your daughters side, other than you expected that role.  Is it for appearances?  Do you have something to prove to the wedding guests?  Or is it that you are so close that you are wanting to be there for her emotional support on her big day because you are the person who could best provide that.  Money doesn\u2019t calm wedding jitters or tell a funny story from childhood or tell the bride how beautiful she looks.  Are you the person who can do that for her or are you just wanting the role for selfish reasons.\n\nI\u2019m going to have to go with YTA.  She didn\u2019t spring anything on you if you never talked about it, and again that\u2019s a big sign that you weren\u2019t close enough to help her plan her day if you were so in the dark.  You behaved like a bank and have been treated like a bank.  What would have made her think you would have wanted it to be any different?", "NTA.  Just don't change your mind when she comes back crying and apologizing after the honeymoon, because she will probably try to return things back to normal and will pretend to be remorseful.", "Info: you saw your ex and Joe got married when daughter was 15, but how long had he been in their lives?", "NTA, and boy does she suck - and sorry on that because I know you're hurt.", "NTA - she got entitled and then got bitten in the butt\u2026", "NTA I would of been just as upset as you were", "NTA you are simply following her lead because she told you how she expects the future of the relationship to go. Walk away go NC and she'll probably eventually be reaching back out crying I would take it with caution", "NTA", "NTA", "Nta", "Sometimes I read these things and I want to hear from the other person. I think you probably reacted out of hurt and what your daughter did was beyond underhanded. She played on your love for her for money. That speaks to very poor character. But as for choosing the SF over the father, I'd at least like to hear the reason.\n\nYou're right to feel hurt and can process that however you want.", "YTA. You sound awfully proud of yourself for doing the bare minimum as a parent\u2014the financial support you\u2019re legally entitled to pay, along with the occasional phone call. In fact, I\u2019d even say you sound downright resentful that you had to do that. Like you are annoyed you were paying all those years for upkeep on a property that didn\u2019t bring in income, or something. \n\nYou describe your relationship with your daughter in mostly transactional terms. Where were you actually parenting? Did you calm her fears when she was going through puberty? Help her over her first heartbreak? Did you help with homework, or cooperate with her mom to celebrate her successes, or give her tough love when she needed it?\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder she treated you like a bank. You trained her to understand that\u2019s the only way you show up for her. It\u2019s obvious she really hurt your feelings, but it was a shitty to make her decision all about you. You might have responded by trying harder to be there for her, or to understand what you can learn from her stepdad, or even just waiting to talk about it with her when this stressful event is over. But it sounds like you just didn\u2019t feel you got your money\u2019s worth.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry for what happened to you.", "NTA \n\nThat's tough stuff, man.  I'm sorry to hear it.", "NTA.  Sounds like you did the best you could and she doesn\u2019t appreciate you as more than a checkbook.  Painful, but I admire your grace in the face of such pain.", "NTA. What a kick in the nuts, I can see why you're hurting. \n\nI do have two questions. You said the mother go remarried when Jackie was 15. How long had they been together before that? It would seem odd she formed a father-daughter relationship with Joe if it was particularly close to her 15th birthday that he came into her life.\n\nDidn't it strike you as a little odd that by the time of the rehearsal dinner you hadn't had any discussion about your role in the wedding? That would've been a warning bell for me.", "NTA. Your daughter used you and she dare blame you? She made her choice and you have every right to make yours. I\u2019m so sorry your daughter is such an ungrateful woman. I hope your son treats you better than this. Sending lots of love!", "NTA. Actions have consequences, and for Jackie to hide an information like this is intentional and dishonest. I just worry that you\u2019re going to regret it down the line.", "Going with NTA because they waited until the eve of the wedding to spring it on you. They wouldn\u2019t have done that unless they knew you would be hurt and they were hoping the pressure of the wedding being the next day would force your silent acquiescence. \n\nAlso her silence when you asked her if she knew this before she accepted your money. She knew what she was doing, she\u2019s just mad she\u2019s facing consequences.", "NTA, your only mistake was not going full NC with her", "NTA. My initial knee jerk reaction was that you should love your daughter unconditionally, but the same goes for your daughter in that she should love you unconditionally as well.  Accepting money for the cost of her wedding while she knew she wasn't going to have you walk her down the aisle is just plain sucky. She should have told you before you handed over the money.", "NTA - She made her bed, now she has to lay in it.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry man, that had to hurt. I think you got reasonably upset without going too far. Hopefully she comes to understand how you must\u2019ve felt and you two can make amends.", "NTA.  Guessing she's realised she's up shit creek without a paddle if Joe can't afford to pay for her law school, she'll have to work and get student loans.  You haven't been a deadbeat Dad, you've done a lot for her and unfortunately your former daughter has turned into a selfish entitled AH.  I can understand you would feel betrayed and don't blame you for your reaction one bit.  Just make sure you follow through with what you said you will be doing.", "NTA\n\nI would cancel everything. Yeah you might not get your money back but she wouldn\u2019t be getting that wedding unless the \u201cfather of bride\u201d paid for it! She knew exactly what she was doing.", "I could totally imagine the daughter having the attitude of \u201call dad\u2019s ever done is throw money at us in lieu of his presence so why shouldn\u2019t I take advantage?\u201d and then also feeling like it would be a betrayal of Joe as the emotionally present parent to not have him stand in as the father. \n\nNotice how OP\u2019s first response to hurt feelings is to relate it all back to money.", "NTA. You paid for most of the wedding, plus all the other sacrifices you made over the years.  She can\u2019t expect you to financially support her going forward.", "Hm. It feels like there\u2019s more to this story. Without additional context, it\u2019s hard to know whether she\u2019s really taking advantage of you or if there\u2019s a good reason she chose her stepdad to give her away. If this is truly how everything happened, you\u2019re NTA but you\u2019re also still her father, despite whatever you both yelled at each other, and she is quite young. I get the sense that she matters a lot to you and that you\u2019re not truly willing to end your relationship with her over this. If I\u2019m right, then you need to be the bigger person here because you\u2019re her father and that\u2019s your job. I think it\u2019s possible you don\u2019t understand her perspective and it might be worth it to hear her out.", "NTA. I didn\u2019t really have a relationship with my father. He paid child support, but that was forced by the government. Sometimes I would see him a few times a year. Sometimes I wouldn\u2019t see him for a few years. He didn\u2019t called me. I never got birthday presents or even cards from him. I might have talked to him once a year because I called him. I was getting married when I was 25, I sent an invitation to him and his whole side of the family. I didn\u2019t actually expect anybody to show up. My father called me a few days before the wedding saying he was going to come. I was shocked because we didn\u2019t live in the same state. It actually never occurred to me that he thought he would walk me down the aisle until the night before my wedding. I did feel bad and awkward letting him know so late. But there was no way he was going to walk me down the aisle when I could count on one hand, the number of times I had talked to him in the previous five years. It sounds like you\u2019ve been involved and loving towards your daughter. I\u2019m sure it was heartbreaking.", "NTA. OP sounds like he has been present throughout daughter\u2019s life and maintained a father/daughter relationship all along. Also, unless it was a very long courtship between Joe and Jackie\u2019s mother, Joe can\u2019t have been in Jackie\u2019s life for the formative years. At the very least, Jackie should have planned a long conversation well ahead of the wedding to break the news with the greatest tact. But honestly, you can\u2019t have another man walk you down the aisle and not expect your father to take it deeply personally.", "NTA that's unbelievably disrespectful and I can not imagine how hurtful it must have been. She's a grown woman and made her decision. You have every right to make your own as well. She outright deceived you into paying for the wedding. For your sake you should probably forgive sooner than later but that's still infuriating. Sorry mate, take care of yourself.", "Seem to be going against the grain but YTA\n\nI can absolutely understand why this scenario was immensely distressing and hurtful BUT you don\u2019t get to pull out of being a parent because your kid did something shitty.\n\nYes you get to feel hurt, yes you should be able to express that and potentially take some actions so you feel psychologically safe but You don\u2019t get to disown your kid because they seem to like someone more than you.\n\nPlacing financial expectations on relationships never ends well.

Jackie's mother and I divorced when she was 2 and they settled in Texas while I'm in New York.  I also have a son Mike (M28).  Their mother married Joe (M70??) when Jackie was about 15. I don't have a particularly high opinion of Joe, but no real complaints about him either. Jackie always seemed lukewarm about him. \n\nDespite the distance, I visited every six weeks, would facetime my kids \\*minimum\\* one a week.  Paid all child support and supported and did anything else ever asked of me.  It was VERY expensive to do this, but I never balked, never complained.  I was there for every big event, and also any small event they ever asked me to attend.\n\nJackie was having a very big wedding and I contributed a lot of money towards it. As in more than half the budget.  At the rehearsal dinner, we were going over some of the discussions about the wedding and I brought up walking her down the aisle and the father daughter dance. Jackie got very silent and told me that she already asked Joe to do it.  \n\nI said to her \"but I'm your father.\" She tells me she really appreciates how kind, loving and generous I had always been towards her but that she had to make a hard choice.  I tell Jackie that I feel unbelievably betrayed. I also feel very manipulated that she is springing this on me the day before the wedding. Especially after she had me pay the lion's share of the costs. I asked Jackie if she knew that I wouldn't be getting the father of the bride role when she took the money and she went dead silent. \n\nI told her that if I'm not her father at her wedding, then she can't call upon me to be her father elsewhere in her life. If I've spent 24 years doing the work, paying for college, paying for her wedding, flying all around the country and carrying all the freight of being a parent but at the biggest day of her life (her words), if she's pointing to another man as her father, then that's a life choice. Joe can take over paying for her law school tuition and that I'm changing my will to leave everything to Mike.  I'm willing to maintain a relationship, but it won't be a father-daughter relationship anymore.\n\nShe starts screaming at me how it is her wedding and it is her right to say who is a father to her and who isn't.  So I ask her \"So you are free to determine who is a father to you?  I can't stop you.

OP sounds so transactional - there is so much more to relationships than money. Paying for things is a part of being a parent but it does not make you a father.

This was in part due to a conflict with my bio dad which he will engender as being a good parent but as actually quite traumatizing (I had undiagnosed anxiety and sought therapy and told him I was worried about how much weed I was smoking and that I was looking for a therapist and psychiatrist very proactively. He said I needed to be committed and withheld all financial support for college if I didn't do this in-patient 72hr  psychological assessment and he had full access to the drs and charts, even in therapy.

During that time, my step dad lifted to pay for college and support me as my father made too much for any financial aid. He isn't the best person in the world but I'd 100% take him over my bio dad anytime.  All this to say that OPs description may be more reflective of his own interpretation than of reality.\n\nIts also indicative that his response is to withdraw both title of father and financial wupport. I'm not saying he shouldn't feel hurt but the reaction is very extreme. \nMy father also cared deeply about other people's perception, and with this being a public event, its possible he felt his reputation was being crushed. \n\nIt's also possible the step dad and mother are manipulative and the daughter feels she owes him.

That's fucked. \n\nSure, you can be hurt that you aren't walking her down the aisle and it definitely should have been a discussion you both had long before thos point but did you ask yourself why she chose Joe instead of you? I can see three options: \n\n1) Joe has earned it. He's been there, day in and day out for a decade, not a FT call once a week and a visit every month or two. The teenage years are hugely important and formative and Joe may have just been there for your daughter. \n\n2) You, frankly, may not have earned it. It might not have anything to do with Joe but your daughter may have issues with you being a transient feature in her life. Did you ever have any custody of her? What about Mike? She has no memory of you filling a true paternal role - more like a kindly, rich uncle, at best. Or, as some of your comments insinuate, you use money to hold your relationship with your daughter to ransom.\n\n3) As other commentators have noted, your daughter may have been pressured by your ex to have Joe walk her down the aisle and, instead of being disowned and screamed at, she needed understanding and support. \n\nYou mentioned in your edits about the relationship being about money, but if it is, she surely learned it from you. Basically all you mention about the relationship is the money you spent on her (child support, school, wedding, etc.) but not really spending any amount of time bonding with her. Seriously, an involved dad would also be paying that AND spending quality time with her too. \n\nMoney \u2260 Love\n\nEDIT: and you don't once mention your daughter's partner. How's your relationship with them? How many times have you met them, had a proper conversation with them? Would they consider you to be a positive factor in their life?

I am close to your age and have two children and I would be devastated to be excluded in that way.  \n\nI wonder, however, if you and your daughter have very different views of your relationship. I was struck by a couple things-the idea that you did anything \u201cever asked\u201d of you and attended anything they asked you to attend and The tone of your letter, which seems very transactional, with absolutely no warmth whatsoever. Then, when you were so (understandably) hurt, your response was to end your father/daughter relationship, and end all financial support. I can not imagine any scenario where I could do that to either of my children-tell then that I am no longer their mother and they can no longer call me Mom. That to me says A LOT about how you see your relationship. Perhaps Joe has been more of a loving father figure for the last nine years than you have given him credit for. \n\nYour are absolutely NTA for the hurt, anger, and betrayal you feel, but YTA for how you handled it. You could have told her how hurt you were, you could have told her you refused to attend the wedding, you could have told her you needed time and space to process this, but instead you decided that your anger about this was greater than your love for her. Again, as a parent, I have a really hard time with that. You mentioned finances multiple times, but you didn\u2019t say anything about how you dreamed of dancing with your daughter at her wedding since she was a baby, about how hard/emotional/exciting it was going to be to walk her down the aisle to the man who would symbolically take over your role of loving and protecting her from now on, etc\u2026, instead you said you were changing your will and leaving everything to her brother and no longer paying for her law school. I could not imagine, under any circumstances, having that be my immediate response.  \n\nIt also seems very strange that in all of the planning for the wedding you never communicated about the father daughter dance. You hadn\u2019t picked song?  Did you think she was picking the song?  If that is the case, didn\u2019t you want to be part of that choice so that the lyrics reflected your love for her and your relationship with her?  I have had songs in mind for years for the mother son dance with my son and the song I hope my husband dances with my daughter to at her wedding. \n\nAgain, you are NTA for your hurt and sense of betrayal, but based on your post, I think you may have missed many signs that the relationship with your daughter is not the one you thought it was or the one she wanted it to be.", "!updateme", "She could have integrated both of you into the wedding and she definitely should have talked to you in advance and given a real explanation if she wasn't going to do that.", "I had my step dad (real dad in my opinion) and bio dad's dad (my grandpa) walk me down the aisle.", "NTA.

Keep practicing and taking constructive criticism and you\u2019ll be fine.", "This is the BEST way", "This is the answer \ud83d\ude04", "What was she hoping for if he hadn't brought it up? That she could just spring it to him during the ceremony and he would keep quiet due to the other people around?", "I bet that is what happens and they will only have themselves to blame for the subtraction of money that happens now. Step dad is 70 so he will not offer support forever and there are always opportunities for a child to need help. Mom seems like a vampire so she won't do it.", "Mum probably paved the way for this whole scenario sadly", "I can\u2019t believe they rather the daughter lose money (law school money) than let her dad walk her down the aisle.", "You should have made it a permanent NC for the reaction. Even if I hated my (hypothetical) ex, he\u2019s still my kids father and I can\u2019t imagine being joyful to my kids face at their fathers death. Wtf.", "Fine point, there at TAH minimum, but the OP is not one of them.", "Very few things are unforgivable, unrepairable fully maybe, but not something they couldn\u2019t work past.  This view is a little to hard line for me. I have relationship in my life that can never go back to the way they were before but I didn\u2019t cut them off either.", "Yet she's having her mom's new partner walk her down the aisle, has a relationship with her mom, and so on? Also, unless the Dad was uninterested in custody, blame the court system. \n\nIn OP's case for the mom to move halfway across the country would likely require a court to sign off on it. Nothing he can do about it at that point.", "Do you have any idea what lifelong abuse does to a person? No, not every adult is able to stand up for themselves. Many people have been made to believe that they deserve to be treated like this. When you turn 18, you don't just magically acquire the ability to stand up for yourself and know right from wrong, especially when wrong has been served as right all your life.", "You learn what is right and what is wrong from the people that raise you...", "You don't learn right from wrong when you are raised by a manipulative and abusive parent.\n\nYou learn how to lie and hide things.", "I think if there was resentment towards the father it would've become obvious before now. There would've been signs that the relationship was fractured. OP was completely blindsided here.", "When men fight for physical custody, they generally get it more often than women do, and its been that way since before he and his ex got divorced. In most cases, this is decided outside of court with both people agreeing the mother should get majority custody. And with three marriage counselors who saw her abusive behavior, he could have made a case for custody, or made it so she couldn't leave the area with the kids. And he said he's a lawyer, so I'm sure he knew that.\n\nBut you have to make that choice to fight for custody. Just like OP made the choice not to move to Texas (I'm guessing staying where he was was better for his career, but if it was something else, it outweighed his desire to be close to bis children)", "I mean, it\u2019s not really up to you to decide what someone else considers a dad. OP\u2019s daughter clearly doesn\u2019t think of him as \u201cdad,\u201d as much as \u201cbiological father.\u201d \n\nI was raised by a single mom, I\u2019m fully aware of the luxury you assume I have. He talked to them once a week. It clearly wasn\u2019t enough.", "Well considering she didn\u2019t ask to be born, yeah she is entitled to the role of daughter. She\u2019s not the one who didn\u2019t fulfill her role, he is. You can\u2019t blame a child for the actions of an adult and she\u2019s only 24. She\u2019s been an adult for like five seconds and OP has been an adult all 24 years she\u2019s been alive. \n\nDaughter definitely sucks for what she did, but that\u2019s a ridiculous argument", "I respect that and I also respect OP:s daughter\u2019s choice in itself. I\u2019d say without having her side it\u2019s impossible to judge her choice. We know OP tried his best from a distance, but she\u2019s not obligated to feel as close to him as a present father, and we also don\u2019t know how good of a father figure Joe was. As she did choose him it\u2019s very possible he was a good and formative presence in her life.", "Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger....but you can bet she married money.", "Mom hates OP and neither of them though he had the cojones to do something like this.", "Oh I know, she didn\u2019t even come and see me when I got back from his passing. I was lucky enough to be able to travel and see him in time. We\u2019ve not spoken for differing lengths of time over the years, but always end up talking again when an emergency/difficult life event happens. \n\nIt\u2019s a difficult relationship to explain, even though I\u2019m my moms youngest (little brother not hers), the roles have always been reversed and I\u2019ve been more like her parent and feel a sense of responsibility for her.", "OP isn't going to be able to fix any of those things.\n\nIf the mother has turned his daughter into an asshole, then she is still an asshole.", "1. She didn\u2019t voice it.\n2. And this only came to fruition at 24 on her wedding day? No build up or anything?\n3. Sure, but that can be said of any post on here.", "Yeah, a lot of people here are making sweeping assumptions and projecting their own negative experiences. They simply assume OP didn't try to get custody, they simply assume he was fine with her taking the kids halfway across the country. \n\nThey also simply assume that the mother was abusive towards the daughter, which is far from a given. Toxic people aren't necessarily toxic to everyone.", "Abusive people don\u2019t limit their abuse to one person. Children are so often the focus of abuse from these types of parents there are whole subreddits about it", "True, but they wouldn\u2019t bent even the next day when they had the chance, oof, I guess they can tell the daughter suck to be you, pay for law school yourself, get loans or something.", "Yeah I was going to say \u201cemergency/difficult life events for who\u201d? I hope you\u2019re seeing a therapist because emotionally abusive and manipulative parents can do a number on you.", "You\u2019re making a big (blanket) assumption with no evidence. If there\u2019s an abusive person in the relationship then yes children can often be on the receiving end of it too but that\u2019s not always the case. There are a lot of cases of abusive or toxic relationships that aren\u2019t aimed at the children. Abusive behaviour is not as black and white as you\u2019re making out."]}
