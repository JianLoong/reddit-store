{"id": 8124, "submission_id": "10jysqd", "title": "AITA for telling my daughter that I'm no longer her father on the eve of her wedding?", "selftext": "I (M58) have a daughter Jackie (F24) who was married recently. Jackie's mother and I divorced when she was 2 and they settled in Texas while I'm in New York.  I also have a son Mike (M28).  Their mother married Joe (M70??) when Jackie was about 15. I don't have a particularly high opinion of Joe, but no real complaints about him either. Jackie always seemed lukewarm about him. \n\nDespite the distance, I visited every six weeks, would facetime my kids \\*minimum\\* one a week.  Paid all child support and supported and did anything else ever asked of me.  It was VERY expensive to do this, but I never balked, never complained.  I was there for every big event, and also any small event they ever asked me to attend.\n\nJackie was having a very big wedding and I contributed a lot of money towards it. As in more than half the budget.  At the rehearsal dinner, we were going over some of the discussions about the wedding and I brought up walking her down the aisle and the father daughter dance. Jackie got very silent and told me that she already asked Joe to do it.  \n\nI said to her \"but I'm your father.\" She tells me she really appreciates how kind, loving and generous I had always been towards her but that she had to make a hard choice.  I tell Jackie that I feel unbelievably betrayed. I also feel very manipulated that she is springing this on me the day before the wedding. Especially after she had me pay the lion's share of the costs. I asked Jackie if she knew that I wouldn't be getting the father of the bride role when she took the money and she went dead silent. \n\nI told her that if I'm not her father at her wedding, then she can't call upon me to be her father elsewhere in her life. If I've spent 24 years doing the work, paying for college, paying for her wedding, flying all around the country and carrying all the freight of being a parent but at the biggest day of her life (her words), if she's pointing to another man as her father, then that's a life choice. Joe can take over paying for her law school tuition and that I'm changing my will to leave everything to Mike.  I'm willing to maintain a relationship, but it won't be a father-daughter relationship anymore.\n\nShe starts screaming at me how it is her wedding and it is her right to say who is a father to her and who isn't.  So I ask her \"So you are free to determine who is a father to you?  I can't stop you.  But if you can decide who is and isn't your father, then don't complain that I'm also free to   decide who is and who isn't my daughter.\"  She then told me I am a shit father for abandoning her on the eve of her wedding.  I told her that she was the one to announce a change to the relationship. She can't tell me I'm not a father to her and then have me continue considering her a daughter.  Also, she chose to announce all this on the eve of the wedding. \n\nSo, that's my story.

He doesn't know what kind of books I like, he doesn't know what kind of music I listen to. He wasn't there to ask me how my day was. He wasn't there for me when I needed him the most. There are just things that money can't buy. \n\nI didn't even have a step father to fill in the role but your daughter did, she had Joe. I personally feel like this is why your daughter sees Joe as her dad and not you. I do think she should have told you Joe would be the father of the bride on her wedding day, but you could have asked her sooner. \n\nIf you thought you would get a father daughter dance, would you not have discussed the song you would dance to and practiced the dance in advance? And like, not the day before her wedding?\n\nThis was an opportunity for you to see that you had created a transactional role for yourself in her life. And instead of actively trying to improving your relationship with your daughter, you cut her off completely. \n\nYou're an asshole for expecting her to see you as her dad when you weren't. And you're an asshole for cutting her off completely without trying to build a relationship with her that's not based on what you do for her financially. \n\nMy dad thinks that throwing money at me and calling once in a while is enough to cement his role as a father in my life and I believe this is a delusion you both share.", "NTA. Wow. What a left fielder she threw at you. I\u2019d also feel betrayed and hurt. I\u2019m sure you would have been OK if she asked to share the duties with Joe. But to completely exclude you from everything? That\u2019s heartless. You\u2019re literally not the father of the bride. I would have reacted the same.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry OP :( I feel hurt on your behalf. I wish Jackie had thought to ask both of you.", "ESH. \n\nYou clearly did everything you thought you could for your children. But the fact is that Joe was more physically present while you were more financially present. Maybe you needed to make harder/different choices, maybe nothing would have changed. \n\nBut your daughter *knowingly* deceived you. She knew that you, as her father, would pay for her wedding because that's what you've always done. She lied by omission by not being 100% transparent about your role in her wedding because she *knew* you did these things as her father. \n\nYou're both in the wrong for trying to police the feelings of the other. It's not wrong to be hurt by what she said, but she's not wrong to choose who walks her down the aisle.", "I get it when people say that contributing monetarily doesn't equate father duties. I get it really. But the daughter is a bigger asshole because she knew from the start that Joe will be walking her down. And still she used OP's money for her \"Biggest Day\". She is old enough to know that OP will assume what he did and that he would be expecting to walk her down. She kept mum deliberately so she can mooch off him. Child support is till kids are 18. OP wanted to be in his kids' life and he was in whatever capacity. \nBottomline is : Pay for your own wedding or make Joe pay for it, if you don't want your father i. It as your father.", "NTA", "ESH\n\nWaiting until right before the wedding to tell you her stepdad would be doing father of the bride duties while accepting your money to pay for the wedding was pretty underhanded of your daughter.\n\nWhile you certainly put the work in to make things work despite the distance, your children were absolutely never required to feel like that was enough. You reacted out of hurt instead of allowing the feelings to cool and having an actual conversation with your daughter.", "ESH. Your daughter because she let you pay so much toward the wedding when she knew you were expecting to walk her down the aisle but that she was having Joe do it instead. She knew it would hurt you, and was afraid you'd pull your financial contribution if she was honest at the beginning. That's beyond manipulative, it's deceitful. \n\nYou because while you really sound like you did a great job with being a long distance dad, you were still not the one who was there parenting her every single day. It's not fair that you aren't taking her feelings and experiences into account and trying to empathize. \n\nThat being said, I don't understand why you couldn't have both done it, one on each side.", "INFO (not that it matters much in the grand scheme of things, but I'm curious): You say you facetimed - I'm assuming that meant you used the alternatives before that was available - what did you do the years before that was even an option?", "NTA She was very manipulative to not tell you this until the day before the wedding. She absolutely knew what she was doing. She got what she needed from you before she told you that you weren't going to be the father of the bride. If she had told you in advance, I would have had more respect for her decision.", "Your daughter doesn\u2019t owe you for doing the bare minimum.  I haven\u2019t seen any emotion about why you want to be by your daughters side, other than you expected that role.  Is it for appearances?  Do you have something to prove to the wedding guests?  Or is it that you are so close that you are wanting to be there for her emotional support on her big day because you are the person who could best provide that.  Money doesn\u2019t calm wedding jitters or tell a funny story from childhood or tell the bride how beautiful she looks.  Are you the person who can do that for her or are you just wanting the role for selfish reasons.\n\nI\u2019m going to have to go with YTA.  She didn\u2019t spring anything on you if you never talked about it, and again that\u2019s a big sign that you weren\u2019t close enough to help her plan her day if you were so in the dark.  You behaved like a bank and have been treated like a bank.  What would have made her think you would have wanted it to be any different?", "NTA.  Just don't change your mind when she comes back crying and apologizing after the honeymoon, because she will probably try to return things back to normal and will pretend to be remorseful.", "Info: you saw your ex and Joe got married when daughter was 15, but how long had he been in their lives?", "NTA, and boy does she suck - and sorry on that because I know you're hurt.", "NTA - she got entitled and then got bitten in the butt\u2026", "NTA I would of been just as upset as you were", "NTA you are simply following her lead because she told you how she expects the future of the relationship to go. Walk away go NC and she'll probably eventually be reaching back out crying I would take it with caution", "NTA", "NTA", "Nta", "Sometimes I read these things and I want to hear from the other person. I think you probably reacted out of hurt and what your daughter did was beyond underhanded. She played on your love for her for money. That speaks to very poor character. But as for choosing the SF over the father, I'd at least like to hear the reason.\n\nYou're right to feel hurt and can process that however you want.", "YTA. You sound awfully proud of yourself for doing the bare minimum as a parent\u2014the financial support you\u2019re legally entitled to pay, along with the occasional phone call. In fact, I\u2019d even say you sound downright resentful that you had to do that. Like you are annoyed you were paying all those years for upkeep on a property that didn\u2019t bring in income, or something. \n\nYou describe your relationship with your daughter in mostly transactional terms. Where were you actually parenting? Did you calm her fears when she was going through puberty? Help her over her first heartbreak? Did you help with homework, or cooperate with her mom to celebrate her successes, or give her tough love when she needed it?\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder she treated you like a bank. You trained her to understand that\u2019s the only way you show up for her. It\u2019s obvious she really hurt your feelings, but it was a shitty to make her decision all about you. You might have responded by trying harder to be there for her, or to understand what you can learn from her stepdad, or even just waiting to talk about it with her when this stressful event is over. But it sounds like you just didn\u2019t feel you got your money\u2019s worth.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry for what happened to you.", "NTA \n\nThat's tough stuff, man.  I'm sorry to hear it.", "NTA.  Sounds like you did the best you could and she doesn\u2019t appreciate you as more than a checkbook.  Painful, but I admire your grace in the face of such pain.", "NTA. What a kick in the nuts, I can see why you're hurting. \n\nI do have two questions. You said the mother go remarried when Jackie was 15. How long had they been together before that? It would seem odd she formed a father-daughter relationship with Joe if it was particularly close to her 15th birthday that he came into her life.\n\nDidn't it strike you as a little odd that by the time of the rehearsal dinner you hadn't had any discussion about your role in the wedding? That would've been a warning bell for me.", "NTA. Your daughter used you and she dare blame you? She made her choice and you have every right to make yours. I\u2019m so sorry your daughter is such an ungrateful woman. I hope your son treats you better than this. Sending lots of love!", "NTA. Actions have consequences, and for Jackie to hide an information like this is intentional and dishonest. I just worry that you\u2019re going to regret it down the line.", "Going with NTA because they waited until the eve of the wedding to spring it on you. They wouldn\u2019t have done that unless they knew you would be hurt and they were hoping the pressure of the wedding being the next day would force your silent acquiescence. \n\nAlso her silence when you asked her if she knew this before she accepted your money. She knew what she was doing, she\u2019s just mad she\u2019s facing consequences.", "NTA, your only mistake was not going full NC with her", "NTA. My initial knee jerk reaction was that you should love your daughter unconditionally, but the same goes for your daughter in that she should love you unconditionally as well.  Accepting money for the cost of her wedding while she knew she wasn't going to have you walk her down the aisle is just plain sucky. She should have told you before you handed over the money.", "NTA - She made her bed, now she has to lay in it.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry man, that had to hurt. I think you got reasonably upset without going too far. Hopefully she comes to understand how you must\u2019ve felt and you two can make amends.", "NTA.  Guessing she's realised she's up shit creek without a paddle if Joe can't afford to pay for her law school, she'll have to work and get student loans.  You haven't been a deadbeat Dad, you've done a lot for her and unfortunately your former daughter has turned into a selfish entitled AH.  I can understand you would feel betrayed and don't blame you for your reaction one bit.  Just make sure you follow through with what you said you will be doing.", "NTA\n\nI would cancel everything. Yeah you might not get your money back but she wouldn\u2019t be getting that wedding unless the \u201cfather of bride\u201d paid for it! She knew exactly what she was doing.", "I could totally imagine the daughter having the attitude of \u201call dad\u2019s ever done is throw money at us in lieu of his presence so why shouldn\u2019t I take advantage?\u201d and then also feeling like it would be a betrayal of Joe as the emotionally present parent to not have him stand in as the father. \n\nNotice how OP\u2019s first response to hurt feelings is to relate it all back to money.", "NTA. You paid for most of the wedding, plus all the other sacrifices you made over the years.  She can\u2019t expect you to financially support her going forward.", "Hm. It feels like there\u2019s more to this story. Without additional context, it\u2019s hard to know whether she\u2019s really taking advantage of you or if there\u2019s a good reason she chose her stepdad to give her away. If this is truly how everything happened, you\u2019re NTA but you\u2019re also still her father, despite whatever you both yelled at each other, and she is quite young. I get the sense that she matters a lot to you and that you\u2019re not truly willing to end your relationship with her over this. If I\u2019m right, then you need to be the bigger person here because you\u2019re her father and that\u2019s your job. I think it\u2019s possible you don\u2019t understand her perspective and it might be worth it to hear her out.", "NTA. I didn\u2019t really have a relationship with my father. He paid child support, but that was forced by the government. Sometimes I would see him a few times a year. Sometimes I wouldn\u2019t see him for a few years. He didn\u2019t called me. I never got birthday presents or even cards from him. I might have talked to him once a year because I called him. I was getting married when I was 25, I sent an invitation to him and his whole side of the family. I didn\u2019t actually expect anybody to show up. My father called me a few days before the wedding saying he was going to come. I was shocked because we didn\u2019t live in the same state. It actually never occurred to me that he thought he would walk me down the aisle until the night before my wedding. I did feel bad and awkward letting him know so late. But there was no way he was going to walk me down the aisle when I could count on one hand, the number of times I had talked to him in the previous five years. It sounds like you\u2019ve been involved and loving towards your daughter. I\u2019m sure it was heartbreaking.", "NTA. OP sounds like he has been present throughout daughter\u2019s life and maintained a father/daughter relationship all along. Also, unless it was a very long courtship between Joe and Jackie\u2019s mother, Joe can\u2019t have been in Jackie\u2019s life for the formative years. At the very least, Jackie should have planned a long conversation well ahead of the wedding to break the news with the greatest tact. But honestly, you can\u2019t have another man walk you down the aisle and not expect your father to take it deeply personally.", "NTA that's unbelievably disrespectful and I can not imagine how hurtful it must have been.

Sorry mate, take care of yourself.", "Seem to be going against the grain but YTA\n\nI can absolutely understand why this scenario was immensely distressing and hurtful BUT you don\u2019t get to pull out of being a parent because your kid did something shitty.\n\nYes you get to feel hurt, yes you should be able to express that and potentially take some actions so you feel psychologically safe but You don\u2019t get to disown your kid because they seem to like someone more than you.\n\nPlacing financial expectations on relationships never ends well.

I tell Jackie that I feel unbelievably betrayed. I also feel very manipulated that she is springing this on me the day before the wedding. Especially after she had me pay the lion's share of the costs. I asked Jackie if she knew that I wouldn't be getting the father of the bride role when she took the money and she went dead silent. \n\nI told her that if I'm not her father at her wedding, then she can't call upon me to be her father elsewhere in her life.

Also ask her why she had to make a hard choice, because it would have been reasonable and perfectly fine to have had BOTH of you walk her down the aisle and have 2 different father-daughter dances.

It could be that such has been happening without your knowledge and she was poisoned against you, but hid it really well. Especially if it happened after your ex wife remarried.
