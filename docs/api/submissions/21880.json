So I (26 M) have a birthday coming up. About a week ago my sister (31 F) told he she wanted to take me on a trip for the weekend of my birthday. I told her yes that that would be great. She wanted to leave Friday and return Sunday and we would be going about two states over so we were looking at about a 10 hour drive. \n\nWell yesterday she calls me and asks me if I\u2019m still free to go and I said yes I can\u2019t wait, we\u2019ll then she tells me great I\u2019ll be booking the hotel in a few days and asked if I\u2019d be okay with a full sized bed in my room. I was a little confused because I had assumed we\u2019d share a room with two beds. I asked and she said no because she needs a separate room for her and the kids. My heart sank a little. She has three kids a 1 and a half year old, a 7 and a 8 year old. \n\nMy sister is also a single mom, so I understand it\u2019s hard and I love my sister to death. But I cannot not stand her kids. Most people can\u2019t. Everyone groans when we have events and find her kids are coming. They\u2019re horrible. My sister loves her kids and takes good care of them but she spoils them and never disciplines them. They walk all over her and when they don\u2019t get their way, they throw a fit until they do and she gives in every single time. They\u2019re loud and obnoxious and they just run rampant no matter who is around. \n\nSo my first thought was being cooped up in a car with them for 10 hours. I\u2019d rather eat glass. Then my next thought was how we wouldn\u2019t get to enjoy anything because she would be constantly trying to wrangle them and yelling at them. And it\u2019s just not how I want to spend my birthday. \n\nSo I asked her if there\u2019s any way she could find a baby sitter and she said no and that she wanted them to have the experience as well. I told her I really appreciated the offer but I\u2019d rather not go as I didn\u2019t think it would be enjoyable for me. She got upset at me and told me I had no idea what it\u2019s like being a single mom and that I should be ashamed of myself as an adult for being to selfish to be around my own niece and nephews.  \n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention 1. She hasn\u2019t purchased anything yet and we aren\u2019t supposed to go for two weeks. And 2. I assumed she would get a babysitter because she gets one all the time when she wants to go out with friends or go on dates. She does this at 3 least times a month. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1689017831, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14w3w63/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_dont_want_to_go_on_a/", "score": 37, "replies": ["NTA this isn\u2019t a present for You, it\u2019s a trip for Her to go on with a build in babysitter.", "NTA\n\nThere's a big difference in a trip with your sister and a trip with children.\n\nIt sounds like she wants to take a trip & has invited you to help wrangle the children.\n\nTell her you won't be able to go & wish her a fun trip.\n\nHappy Birthday!", "NTA. That sounds like an awful birthday experience.  As a parent, I wouldn't expect someone to put up with my kids crap.  She has to know her kids are insufferable, so like it shouldn't be a surprise if you don't want to spend a whole weekend stuck with them", "NTA Sounds more like this was a trip away for her and a babysitting weekend for you.", "NTA.\n\n\"I should be ashamed of myself as an adult for being to selfish to be around my own niece and nephews.\"\n\nI'm not sure I parsed this sentence correctly but I'm sure I disagree with the sentiment. It's baffling to me to think that people will call *you* selfish for not wanting to be around *their* kids.   \nIt's also pretty clear to me that she wanted a vacation and couldn't handle all of her kids alone so she disguised this a birthday outing so you would go.\n\nDo your thing and enjoy your birthday.", "NTA 10 hours in a car with 3 children of those ages doesn't sound fun for anyone, and it doesn't seem  unreasonable to think that a trip for *your* birthday would be focused on you. \n\nI'd suggest you suggest to her that you and she do something like going out for a meal together to celebrate your birthday but make clear that you're proposing a adult evening , not s family one.", "NTA,\n\nI would rather wat glass too. And you will not do anything you want. It will be about her kids. This sounds more like a gift for her children then for you sadly.", "NTA - I wouldn\u2019t go either.", "NTA. Your sister wanted a vacation with help.  This weekend was about her, not you.", "> She got upset at me and told me I had no idea what it\u2019s like being a single mom and that I should be ashamed of myself as an adult for being to selfish to be around my own niece and nephews.\n\nbwahahahaha.\n\nNTA. \n\nYou changed my mind at the last minute, well done.", "NAH. It's understandable that she can't/doesn't want to find a sitter for a whole weekend, but I can definitely see how that would put a damper on your trip. It's supposed to be for your birthday, so obviously you should enjoy it. You're not obligated to pretend to have fun", "NTA. It's no longer your birthday trip, is it? You really can't equate a weekend away with a night out, so you should have expected the kids to come along. But, I wouldn't want to go on this trip either.", "NTA. You thought she was doing something nice for you for your birthday, but she wasn\u2019t - it was an excuse for her to take her kids on vacation. Your birthday just happened to be convenient. \n\nThis was never your birthday present, and it was selfish of your sister to propose it that way. And I suspect that this was never going to be a fun trip for you - you were going to be an unpaid babysitter and chaperone for your own birthday trip. \n\nIn short - your sister was planning to make sure you were going to find out what it was like to be a single parent for your birthday.", "NTA\n\nShe didn't communicate the full plans, or changed the plans without telling you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA vs E.S.H because she called you selfish.  Its your birthday present.  not their family vacation.", "NTA but only because according to one of your comments, this all came to light several weeks before the trip and no one was out any money. \n\nKnowing her situation and your dislike for your sister's kids, the first thing you should have done when she brought up the idea was ask what she planned to do with her kids while you were gone. It would have saved everyone involved a lot of time and hurt feelings. Be the adult next time.", "NTA but did you think she will get a babysitter for the whole weekend? And also leaving the 1 1/2 year old there. I mean I get it if you have family and they offer to do it but if you already say that they are a lot...", "NTA. It was her decision to have kids and no one is obliged to like kids. Don't go and enjoy your birthday at home by yourself or friends that you want to be around. I hate it when people try to guilt you into doing thing you don't want to. No means no.", "NTA.  This isn't a trip for you but for her kids, with you as a helper.", "NAH. You're allowed to not want to go on a holiday with her and her kids, but you can't also expect your single mother sister to not want to take her kids with her on a getaway.", "NAH, but that's some terrible communication on both your parts (but if I'm being honest, I think it was worse of her not to tell you that she was bringing the kids.)", "I mean, you really should have clarified details like that beforehand. You're NTA for not wanting to go, but you definitely handled it poorly.", "NTA but I\u2019m also loath to call her an asshole considering she was going to take you on a trip. \n\nI don\u2019t blame you though- I would rather shoot my foot off then spend a wknd with badly behaved kids for my bday.", "NTA. But just go. Take one for the team. Learn to ignite the niblings", "I don\u2019t understand how you thought that your sister, who is a single mom, was going away for the weekend without her kids. That lack of sensitivity and insight makes me wonder about all the ways you\u2019ve described them.", "INFO: you know she\u2019s a single mom, what did you think she was going to do with her kids? Why didn\u2019t you ask?", "ESH, this was bad communication on both sides. She should have mentioned that she was planning to include her kids, but it was naive of you not to consider the possibility that she was planning to bring them - she's a single mom, they're young, and it sounds like they typically go where she goes. You're not an AH for not wanting to go on the trip, but she's not an AH for being upset about it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your sister has knowingly raised her kids to be brats and it\u2019s about time she gets used to the fact that they ruin get togethers and no one wants to be around them. It\u2019s your birthday for crying out loud and not an \u201cexperience \u201c for her kids. She can do something with them another time. I get the feeling she just needs you along as help and not for your birthday. And just an FYI for your sister many, many single mothers raise children without spoiling them despite the difficulties of being a single parent. My hat\u2019s off to all of them.", "She wants to to do something for your birthday that does not bring you joy. You can't be forced to like going on a roadtrip with her kds and your birthday present shouldn't be spending time doing something you don't want. That's just silliness. Even if her kids were all well behaved you still wouldn't be an asshole for thinking that a roadtrip with 3 young kids doesn't sound fun in general. Did your sister forget who *your* birthday is about?", ">\"...I should be ashamed of myself as an adult for being to selfish to be around my own niece and nephews...\"\n\nI think it's ok to be a little selfish around your own birthday. If it was your Sister's birthday or  one of kids, maybe I could agree, but on your own birthday? Yeah, you get to be selfish a bit.\n\nNTA\n\nEDIT: I don't want to paint your sister in a bad light but this whole thing reeks of a vacation for her and her kid because she plans ask you to watch them or at least help.", "Nta\n\nYeah when I read the kids and misbehavior... she's gonna use you to watch her kids.", "This!!!!!! \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf", "!!!!", "That\u2019s the other problem. She\u2019s one of those parents who are completely oblivious to her children\u2019s behavior. A doctor even told her that she needs to stop being their friend and be their mom so she went and got another doctor.", "She frequently has a baby sitter who is kind of family however I didn\u2019t consider the differences between a baby sitter for a night and a whole weekend. So I definitely dropped the ball on that logic.", "She hasn\u2019t purchase anything yet and we\u2019re not supposed to go for two weeks.", "I added an edit because I forgot to mention, she does that often. She always has babysitters when she wants to go out.", "Because I\u2019ve seen her find babysitters many many times when she\u2019s wanted to go out do stuff with her friend or dates and things like that.", "Wow!! So she's slightly delusional too. Yeah I wouldn't want to be stuck with that at all for a whole weekend. Now I feel bad for the kids. But your still NTA!", "Yeah you're NTA. Just next time something like this comes up with her, check that invite list beforehand. This goes for every parent in your life as most parents automatically include their family unit. Happy Birthday in two weeks, I hope you find something else fun and exciting to do instead!", "An evening\u2019s date is quite a bit different than leaving your kids for a whole weekend.", "It\u2019s not that easy to get a babysitter for a whole weekend. N A H in terms of not wanting to go, YTA for agreeing to the trip without asking a kind of obvious question."]}
