The nudists I know don't do this.\n\nThis mom is going to expect to be up in all your business,  all the time.  It's a no for me.", "I would RUN, red flag his mom does everything and babies him, red flag the naked aspect and he wants to do the same with his kids...

I would call it quits there is no compatibility here.", "NAH - it\u2019s fine for him and his mum to be ok with doing this (even if I personally wouldn\u2019t!); it\u2019s also perfectly ok for you to object to it in your own home. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t move in with them knowing this is normal behaviour for them both, it would be wrong to ask his mum to change the way she relaxes in her own home. And it\u2019s ok for you to set a \u2018clothes on\u2019 boundary with your boyfriend if you look for a place together.

The fact that yours is more common in our society doesn\u2019t mean you are right and he is wrong. It just means that you are different. This is a compatibility issue, pure and simple. How you navigate it will define a lot, I think. Maybe see a therapist together to work on what a compromise might look like?", "NAH. \n\nThese are preferences on etiquette and propriety. He doesn't have to conform to your expectations, and you don't have to conform to his. \n\nThat said, his approach that you have to justify yourself comes off as a little smug, as if \"I bet you can't logically convince me to change my ways when I can just say everything is relative.\" He should have led with, \"I disagree, but it matters to me that you are uncomfortable. Let's have a conversation and see what's really important to both of us.\"", "Ew imagine living all day there with the MIL walking around the house naked. Well in their own house they can do whatever they want, you can't tell him to stop it but in a house where you, him and your children will live in then that's weird indeed so by that I'll say NTA.

I think you would be better off out of it.", "Research covert incest.", "NTA\nThis is very unusual and screams no boundaries and enmeshment. If you are unfamiliar with enmeshment in families, definitely look it up. There's also a book called \"When He's Married to Mom.\" It's not a perfect book, but it is helpful. Therapy is also helpful. Each person on their own and together. It's totally possible he cannot see why it is weird especially if it is what he grew up with and if he was trained to not have any boundaries. It's one thing to walk around naked in your own house alone or with your spouse, or I suppose on a nude beach, it's quite another to do it with your parents or children. If you're interested in marrying and having kids, you will both have to agree on boundaries, what they mean to you and how they support you as a strong healthy couple together Before all that big stuff happens. Some people think boundaries are bad and keep relationships away like fences. Boundaries are more like outlines that provide healthy definition to things, people, and relationships. It helps people know their feelings, thoughts, and decisions are theirs and someone else's are that other person's. Autonomy means we can support and celebrate each other because we respect each other as whole human beings. Interdependence not codependency. \n\nAlso, he should be helping out around the house. If you move in together, hopefully he knows how to do some basic things and doesn't expect you to do everything. Good luck OP!", "NAH- they are nudists and you were raised to wear clothing.

I most definitely would not want to see my 19yo son walking around naked, nor would I ever be naked around him - and likewise for my daughter /husband! It's inappropriate by all normal standards. This is something he grew up with and the issue stems from his mom, he learned it from her, she normalized it for him. This would be a breaking point for me if I couldn't get my husband to understand my feelings on this.", "NTA... That's messed up!  And he wants his kids to do the same?   Now I have a son, and yeah, I babied him.  But I also taught him about privacy and basic decorum, modesty, self-awareness, and that there are creepy people out there.  Ask him to go to an unbiased therapist to unpack that stuff before he has kids!", "NTA\n\nThis is really weird and it's sexual and almost incest-y cause who tf does this\n\nId gtfo if I were you op", "NTA, but if he doesn't see what troubles you, and want to do the same with his kids, then you know what you want to do or not.", "what in the french fried fuck did i just read", "This is giving Stan smith in the bathtub with his mom vibes", "This would probably be something that you should ask yourself.

You should probably run, because it's clear to me already that this isn't going to change.", "Oh Lordy. \n\nINFO: Is your bf Asian? In some East Asian cultures, being nude around other adults, including strangers, in public baths/showers isn\u2019t seen as such a big deal. \n\nWith that being said, that\u2019s usually only in a bathing setting\u2026 does your bf do this only before/after bathing, or does he Free Willy around the house all day?", "This is definitely weird! I wouldn't be comfortable with this at all and would even say this is slightly Freudian.", "NTA. There are red flags all around. The biggest being she does everything for him. Get out now because this ain\u2019t going away. As you stated old gfs told him it made them u comfortable too so he knows it\u2019s an issue with a SO and doesn\u2019t plan to stop. If he plans on taking her everywhere he goes she won\u2019t stop, he may in the future but she won\u2019t and who do you think he\u2019ll side with?", "NTA- I'd be very carefully asking myself if this is something I want to be involved in.  Since they are both ok with it, then it is fine for them but you wont be comfortable there if you are constantly wondering if naked MIL is going to burst in on you while your showering.\n\nAnd if he is such a big mama's boy, do you really want to deal with that? I sure wouldn't as he wont ever change while living with her.", "NTA. The nudity thing is a personal preference and your opinion on it isn't necessarily right BUT you're expressing your boundaries and needs within the context of potentially moving into the house. Regardless of the way you or he sees the nudity aspect, you deserve to feel comfortable in your home and this would make you uncomfortable. If he wants you to move in, he needs to respectfully listen to your concerns and work with you to find a mutually agreeable solution. Railroading you into being exposed to his nude mother isn't OK and doesn't bode well for the future of this relationship. \n\nThe nudity isn't the issue, the lack of respect and belittling of your perspective is. Focus on that first and foremost. Secondly, reflect on his expectations of you given that his mother does everything for him - will you live there forever? If you move out together, will he expect you to take up her mantle and cater to his every need?\n\nThese are the real issues. Nudity within families isn't inherently bad or unhealthy, but not respecting other people feeling uncomfortable with it is.", "NTA - Congrats on finding this out before it was too late.", "For now YTA but I understand your discomfort. The treatment of non-sexual nudity can vary considerably between and within cultures. Comfort and discomfort with this type of nudity is learned: most Americans would have personal feelings more like yours and mixed-gender nudity is taboo, while such nudity is unremarkable in Germany, and covering up in a mixed gender sauna would be taboo in Finland. Differences exist for even same gender nudity (at least for men because I have never been in all-woman spaces). In decades past and in some locations, things like same gender communal showers, using steamroom/saunas/hot tubs nude, full nudity while changing and moving around a locker room, and even swimming nude were unremarkable. Now, most showers are stalls, it\u2019s common to see bathing suits in communal showers/sauna/steam/hot tubs, many people change under a towel, and swimming in bathing suits is the norm (this change was more than cultural).\n\nAssuming you\u2019re in the US, your views on unabated nudity between generations in the home and the agreed-to lack of privacy in the bathroom are in line with the prevailing cultural norms. So it\u2019s understandable those practices are unfamiliar to you and thus uncomfortable. \n\nBut a mutual decision to depart from the norm isn\u2019t *inherently* a bad thing, and your pejorative description of it to your BF and the way he was raised is the main problem here. It\u2019s one thing to say: \n\n1. These practices with nudity and privacy are not what I want to do (entirely your decision). \n\n2. These practices make me uncomfortable to be around (compromise between respecting your wishes and respecting their home; either they respect your wishes, you are present despite the discomfort, or you don\u2019t go places where the nudity is practiced. None of these is inherently right or wrong; just have to figure out which is the way forward here); or \n\n3. A home that I live in will not have these practices (your prerogative but could mean lack of compatibility with bf).\n\nBut instead, you\u2019ve deemed the way he was raised inherently problematic. It\u2019s not really for you to judge the nudist-sounding practices of your bf\u2019s family growing up and through today. That it makes you personally uncomfortable and is not something you\u2019d consider when raising your own family are valid points for your future. The problem here is that you drew upon those feelings to insult his and his family\u2019s past and present.", "Undecided if yta or not. But I think you need to consider if this is deal-breaker for you. They are not going to change. If you don't want to live in that kind of household, you and your boyfriend may not have a future together.", "NTA for your partner pushing you when you're clearly uncomfortable. Just because he and his mother are comfortable being nude around you, doesn't give them an excuse to do so. It's non-consensual since you're not okay with it. Deciding to walk around naked is very much a choice and is not something everyone is comfortable with. I also find it weird that he doesn't try and ask 'how can I make you comfortable' or simply recognizing he has a different perspective but wants to work with you. \n\nIn terms of \"saying he's weird\" I suggest being very careful about what you mean. I think this is a conversation about general boundaries and figuring out a compromise of how he can understand you and vice versa.", "YTA.\n\n- but only for telling him it\u2019s \u201cweird\u201d what he does in his household. \n\nYour boyfriend has the right to live in his house and maintain his family relationships the way he likes. If nudity isn\u2019t a big deal in their household, that\u2019s completely their choice. You shouldn\u2019t be dictating what\u2019s okay and what\u2019s not for what he does in his own life.\n\nHowever, if you were to start a family, that should be 50% your choice how you want to run things, and you\u2019d not be TA at all for wanting things a certain way. He sounds a bit unwilling to compromise or adjust, so I think you might have some compatibility issues down the road.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"And as for why I told him to stop doing it is because he wants me to move in with them. I want to feel comfortable living there and this is all very strange to me.\" .. You KNOW how they live. He was honest about it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can chose: Move in, and share their lifestyle. Or don't move in.", "I have a older son and if I walked in naked or if walked in on him naked he would ABSOLUTELY die. I think this is a clear example of not having enough boundaries and you need to run because she is going to be a straight up nightmare", "YTA. This isn't a sexual thing its a cultural thing. They aren't hurting anyone. Many cultures don't stigmatize everything and try to apply sex to it. \n\nNow I wouldn't live that way. I probably wouldn't stay with someone whos doing that or wanted to be naked around future children all the time either. Perfectly fine to feel that way and make your decisions based on it. Just don't judge them and try to apply something that isnt' part of it to them.", "YTA- But only for telling him what he does in the comfort of his own home is wrong.\n\nI can see both sides in this. I have a similar relationship with my mom and one sibling simply because the sibling hated wearing clothes and I would always invade my mothers space without thinking about it when young and we all just got used to it. but if it were my father or other siblings I\u2019d be VERY uncomfortable. \n\nI\u2019m past the age of complete desensitization but I\u2019d actually support this lifestyle because it teaches to not view eachother so sexually. However that would require a lot of people to raise their children this way and I just don\u2019t see that happening realistically.", "You\u2019re definitely NTA, but BF kinda is. \n\nPersonally, there\u2019s enough red flags here that you should run. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re nudists, I think they have very poor boundaries. He\u2019s a 25yo mommy\u2019s boy and they want you to move in? Nah. Terrible idea.", "YTA  There is nothing wrong with this.  They are bodies and we are comfortable with ours.  We do this in our house and my husbands Mom was the same with him.  The only one making it weird is you.  Its not like they are lusting after each other but just doing what they have to do.

Nobody should be pressured to be naked if they don\u2019t want to be.", "Yeah, it's relevant and probably spills over into other parts of his life without realizing it.  Hope his mom gets help, too.", "LMFAO my bad, but. okay, girl, for real\u2014 the non-nudist nudity is the Iranian yogurt here. it's super freaking weird (as somebody who was not raised this way) but you've got bigger problems. \n\nyou have a 25yo man who is perfectly fine with his mother doing *everything* for him and he sees no issue with the arrangement to the point where he wants *you* to move in and be part of it too. i see nothing in your comments about him willing to change this coddling dynamic with his mum, and with people like this it's often that they aren't looking for future partners but future *parents* to take up where mummy left off.\n\nthis is not something you can change. no one can, except your skivvie-less SO, and why would he? he's got everything he could possibly want \u2014 mum to cater to him, you on the bench ready to be tagged in. he's got it made, far as he's concerned.\n\nanything future-wise you two are looking at, like what the kids would say/do with the future frockless if/when you have them, is putting the cart before the horse *unless* he has a whole ass epiphany about his dependency on mom and decides it's time to leave the nest to be his own clothing-optional person. (but i wouldn't hold my breath about it.)", "Then I would say NAH, if there\u2019s no kind of emotional incest going on then it just sounds like a unique lifestyle. But I recommend sitting your bf down and telling him that if he wants you to move in, he\u2019s going to have to accept your boundaries. Relationships are a compromise, and it would become your home too if you came in. Is there a compromise that would make you both comfortable? Perhaps if he wore only boxers or something?", "Then don't live with them.", "No\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu decide if you want to marry him at the price of joining his livestyle. AND at the price of living with his mom for the rest of your life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut: You do not get to demand HIS mom change her lifestyle in HER house. You can ASK him to move to another home with you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd then you make your decission.  - in this case, it does not sound like he is willing to gice in to your demands. \"if this is someone I saw myself marrying? \" .. STILL see yourself marrying him? IF you mary him KNOWING he will stay a nudist with mom, this is your future life. THIS will not change, he does not want it to change - you need to respect that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you expect for something to magically change just because of some fancy ceremony in a white dress, you are deluding yourself. \n\nTHIS IS WHO he is. And he is honest about it. NOW MAKE YOUR CHOICE. Either marrying him ims MORE important - than marry him and accept it. OR marrying him is NOT more important - then don't marry him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is nothing wrong with you not wanting to chat with his nude mom while on the toilet. There is nothing wrong with him being a nudist either. YOU have to decide if you want to live THAT close with his mom.", "Your right.", "Its their household culture. Like, mine is that my mom is comfortable being naked around me but I don't get naked around her, and we're both fine with that. Their household culture is that casual nudity is NBD and really, that's just fine for them. Your other issue is the one that would have had me noping out the first time he mentioned it.", "It is a cultural thing. Multiple cultures exist within the US that do not depend on race/nationality/religion or other visible differentiators.", "You think there aren't other cultures you'd find strange? lol what does that have to do with anything.", "Well, this amount of nudity in every day activities points to nudism, which is its own philosophy. Other practices that don\u2019t go as far as here but would be taboo in the most US circles while not elsewhere: mixed gender nudity at beaches and other locations without a special designation (Germany), mixed gender nudity in saunas and taboo for not being nude (Finland), and inter generational usually same-gender nudity in large spas/pools (South Korea, Japan). Practices with same gender nudity even vary within the US today and certainly have varied for the entire US over time. Bizarrely, the same decades that have seen a liberalization in the way sex is treated in the US has seen the exact opposite cultural treatment of same gender non-sexual nudity.", "Yes, I\u2019d like to know too", "No, that would be them being assholes or no assholes depending on how they communicate this. Your personal discomfort is valid and you should not be shamed into doing anything you don\u2019t want to do. The problem so far is that you\u2019ve projected those feelings onto past and present practices that don\u2019t involve you.\n\nBut to your question, if this is not something you\u2019d be comfortable with in your own living space, either you don\u2019t move in but stay together, they change their practices, or this is a compatibility issue that could end the relationship. Of course the last outcome would be sad, but your boyfriend\u2019s decision about how to live his life are just as valid as your decisions about how to live your life.", "That doesn't make either of you an AH. YOU just need to make a decision if you're willing to continue the relationship knowing this. He's making a similar decision, he wont continue it if you aren't going to. \n\nYou wouldn't be the AH for peacing out now knowing this.", "No, because in that case they both need to understand you didn\u2019t grow up that way. You\u2019re not desensitized the way they are and in the grand scheme of things a conversation about how to accommodate everyone\u2019s boundaries needs to be had.", "This would not make hin TA. But it does not fit for you, so do not move in", "Or they're not nudists, and he's in denial about being in an incestuous relationship with his Mom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn any event, OP should RUUUUNNNN!", "They don\u2019t run around naked all the time but sometimes he\u2019s completely naked and she\u2019s helping him look for his clothes. I think that\u2019s something he can do for himself as a 25 year old, whilst wearing a robe or at least a towel around his lower half. \n\nThe apartment is not small by any means. I\u2019m talking they\u2019ll have full conversations whilst she\u2019s sitting naked in the bathtub and he\u2019s just standing there in the bathroom looking at this. Idk I just find it very strange.\n\nHe expects me to be okay with it so that our future children also walk around naked.", "Ooo that could be the case. We live in the UK and yeah it\u2019s not very common here", "She\u2019s a lovely woman, I get along with her but yeah I have a feeling there\u2019s some enmeshment in their relationship and neither of them are aware of it. He does have narcissistic traits and I think she might\u2019ve done the damage without realising it.", "Yeah, after reading a lot of comments, I am realising that I have bigger issues to think about than the nudity thing. You\u2019ve put everything into perspective for me and yeah I\u2019m a little concerned about the whole mommy situation now\u2026", "I won\u2019t be living with them anytime soon but I\u2019m thinking long-term this won\u2019t work. Eventually one of us will have to move in with the other (say after marriage) and he wants to take his mom with him wherever he goes.", "What are you talking about? I said if it was a cultural thing I\u2019d understand but it\u2019s not. I would not disrespect a culture I know nothing about. This is something that he and his mom do - no one else in their family does this.", "Fair points. Same sex saunas is not what I am talking about, more about going to the toilet when some is already in there.  Doing a poo with someone having a bath or shower is a bit odd.", "Here\u2019s a gold medal \ud83e\udd47, that leap might just set a world record.", "He and his mom can do whatever they want in their home. But you and he had different upbringings, and both should be respected when blending your lives together. So if he wants to live with YOU and any future children you two may have, then you also get a say in what happens in your home - he doesn't get to decide for you. Counseling, now, before things go any further. You need to find out if this is a deal breaker for you two.", "I was the naked kid who never grew out of it. It was just me and my mom for a long time, and I never gave much thought to walking out of the shower naked, or walking into my mom's room while she was changing to ask her something, and neither did she. After my stepdad and her married in my early teens I briefly (and uncomfortably) started worried about making sure I was decent before running to the bathroom or getting out of the shower, until I got comfortable and went right back to not being terribly concerned if my family saw me naked once I realized that my stepdad's only commentary or interest would be if I was dripping water on the floor or left my clothes on the floor in the bathroom. He was an old hippy and could not care less if I had pants on. I was close to my stepdad in the sense he's an awesome guy, was a good male influence in my life who was always there for me, and was an amazing partner to my mom, but there was never anything weird or uncomfortably close about our relationship, nor did it even cause any weirdness for me. If anything I'm a lot more chill about bodies than most people, and more comfortable with my own, even when it isn't instagram-perfect. I never grew up thinking of my body as shameful or as only worthy of existing to be pleasing to others, it's just my body, the thing that gets me around. I genuinely think that more non-sexual, normalized nudity would do most people a ton of good. The way things are now we frame bodies as something we should be embarrassed to show unless they're for the viewing pleasure of others (and up to those peoples standards), and most of us only see nudity when the person being shown is chosen specifically for how perfect their body is. I grew up knowing it wasn't particularly weird that my body didn't look airbrushed, and not thinking too much one way or another what random people thought of it. I'll definitely have the same relaxed attitude towards nudity with my kids if I ever have any unless they ever become uncomfortable with that.", "I could be wrong ofc but it does sound like they're nudists. Nudists are generally comfortable with their bodies and non judgemental of other people's nudity. If you've an issue with boundaries like the whole walking in while the others in the bathroom you can bring it up with him. For them they've been doing this for years so they're probably not even thinking about it, it's probably just automatic like when you leave a pot to soak after cooking. You don't really think about it", "yeah... pretty much. it's also solidified by the fact that your guy flat out admitted that his buds also find it weird - everybody but his mum is pointing out how whackadoodle bonkers this situation is and he's still grasping for someone to validate him (and mummy). someone to tell him yeah that's perfectly normal, we do it round ours all the time.\n\nbelated realization to tack on: it's also dismissive as hell of your comfort and boundaries that he presumes you'll move in and just Be Okay with this. like, sure, nudists can nude all they want and there's all the arguments for why bodies shouldn't be inherently sexualized, whatever...but. consent is a huge thing. and it seems like mum and boy don't care so much about yours when this is \\~just how they do things\\~. and that's a real bad attitude to have about anything, full stop.", "Oh now that is a WHOLE new issue. Casual nudity in your home isn't really a big red flag for most, but him insisting on living with Mommy for the rest of his life certainly is. It would be a big fat NOPE for me, bc I'd feel like the 2nd sister wife forever. You gotta get that part sorted out before making any living arrangements whatsoever.", "Oh no think what you want to do while it's early", "Him wanting to take his mom with him wherever he goes is the bigger problem IMO.  \n\nNTA", "Well this seems like borrowing trouble from the future for the most part. But, nudity aside, if his expectation is that his mother will move in with you immediately, and yours is not, that sounds like a significant compatibility issue.", "You need to leave this relationship. Your boundaries are too different. When children eventually become involved, your parenting styles will not mesh. There will be constant fights and you should never feel uncomfortable in your own home. Find someone better suited to you.", "The way you are raised is part of your culture. People can move and still follow their culture even if no one else around them does. \n\nWhat are you talking about lol", "Certainly not typical. Not that inherently problematic: as a matter of course, we poo next to someone else pooing with a tiny wall between us in public restrooms. Adults almost never go their whole lives without that experience. So it\u2019s a shower curtain instead of a wall. My cup of tea? Hell no. \n\nBut I think the red flag here for the relationship is the future plans to stay living with mom, regardless of clothing worn or not. But OP didn\u2019t ask WIBTA for ending the relationship. She asked based on telling her bf that the way he was raised is \u201dweird.\u201d", "I like your comment because it\u2019s given me a new perspective, you\u2019ve put in better words than anyone in this thread trying to explain what you\u2019ve just explained. Thank you for sharing, I appreciate it", "I like your answer, You\u2019re right, this must be second nature to them by now so I can\u2019t just expect him to stop doing it. I need to find a better way of explaining the issue to him or just RUN as most comments are suggesting", "I see. How do I kindly tell him I don\u2019t want to live with his mom for the rest of our lives? He obviously loves her a lot and this will be hard for him to hear so I want to say it in the best possible way", "But the rest of his family don\u2019t practice this\u2026 so how is it a cultural thing? I think you need to get off the internet and fight someone else", "This is kind of how I was raised as well. My mom and my aunts would walk from the bathroom to their room naked or get dressed with us there. We\u2019d have conversations with them in the bathroom while showering. I never thought anything of it and it was early exposure to different body types and feeling comfortable. Eventually as I got older, my dad was the one uncomfortable with it and would yell at my mom for being naked when I didn\u2019t know why it was a big deal. So that\u2019s when we just stopped and I started to develop insecurities about my body and such. \n\nI think it\u2019s fine to wait until a kid sets a boundary and that it\u2019s fine if they never do. Our bodies shouldn\u2019t be shameful and I kind of resent my dad for making me feel like mine was. But seeing my mom comfortable in her post-baby body really helped me once I had a baby", "I wish you luck with the overemeshed MIL, that's its own issue and I have one of my own so I sympathize.\n\nI've got to add one more argument for not making nudity weird or sexualizing it when it comes to kids. I never, ever thought it was normal when my friends' dads, or other older men, covertly started checking us out when we started puberty. It seemed to be this accepted thing that grown men couldn't help but look once a girl  started developing, and I knew damn well that wasn't the case because I did not have to worry walking past my stepdad or grandfather even if I was bare assed, never mind wearing a bikini or a crop top. I found it creepy as hell, and I still do when people make that argument for making sure their daughters are \"covered\" at home because of dad. It's weird as hell to look at your kids like that, and somebody who you'd be concerned about seeing your kid naked is probably somebody you should be concerned about being around kids period.", "I think you need to decide if this makes you uncomfortable enough to no longer be in the relationship or if it's something you can move past. I think you should think about it, consider whether or not putting a specific boundary in place would be enough and then discuss it with him knowing what you need to be comfortable beforehand", "Your phrasing here is a good start. Plenty of non-nudists (I know they reject the label but that\u2019s what their practices indicate) have massive boundary/independent issues with an overbearing parent and have incompatible expectations for parental living arrangements.\n\nIt sounds best to decouple that from the nudity issue and handle each separately. If he\u2019s never going to not live with his mom and that\u2019s problem with you, the nudity issue is moot."]}
