That being said, it's also understandable to feel frustrated when someone takes an excessive amount of time to get ready for an event that you both agreed to attend.\n\nIn this case, it sounds like you did try to communicate with your girlfriend about the importance of leaving on time, and she chose to ignore your requests. It's also worth noting that you did give her the option to leave with you, which she declined.\n\nHowever, where things start to get a bit murky is when you told her parents that she was still getting dressed. It's understandable that you didn't want to admit that you left without her, but lying to her parents could come across as immature and dishonest.\n\nFurthermore, it's not fair to expect your girlfriend to take all the blame for being late, especially when you could have just waited for her or found a compromise (such as taking separate cars). In a relationship, it's important to work together as a team, and that means taking responsibility for each other's actions.\n\nSo, in conclusion, while you may not be the asshole for leaving without your girlfriend, it's important to consider how your actions could have been perceived and how you can improve your communication and teamwork in the future.", "ESH\n\nI don\u2019t blame you for leaving early but you should have made a better excuse and she probably would have let things slide.", "ESH. if it were one of my bf\u2019s best mates and I was running late I would\u2019ve volunteered that I could come later. \n\nI agree w your gf that a relationship is like being a team but in this scenario I think she didn\u2019t pull her weight as a good team mate to be ready on time. It\u2019s unfair to you to always be late to things because of how long it takes her to get ready. She is the AH. You need to be careful about how to talk to her about this. Perhaps you need to sit down and figure out what being a good teammate consists of. \n\nImagine if it were a sports team and you had kick off at 8pm would the rest of the team wait for the player who is late or is it the player who is late who is letting down the team?\n\nYou are the slight AH for saying she is still getting ready when you could\u2019ve made a more socially acceptable excuse", "Speaking as a chronically late person, NTA for leaving or being honest with her parents about why she was late.  \n\nYou\u2019re a little bit of an AH for saying she was whining, though - children whine, using that term to describe an adult woman\u2019s behavior comes across as condescend and a bit sexist.

Being villain when she cant  be on time?", "N T A as you explained it, but there is some missing \n\nINFO: \n\nHave you ever told your girlfriend any negative opinions about her hair style or natural hair texture? \n\nDoes she have naturally curly or \"frizzy\" hair? \n\nIs she of a non-white background?\n\nIt's easy to say \"start getting ready earlier\" but if OP (or his family who they were going to see) has historically complained about or maligned a GFOC's natural hair texture not looking \"feminine\", \"professional\" or \"attractive\" because it's not straight then obviously this is not the GF's problem.", "Nta, but I would have lied to her parents. No need to rub salt in it. \"Something came up, but don't worry she is one the way. We wanted to make sure one of us was here for the surprise.\"", "Right? Lmao \"we're a team so you need to do exactly what I want you to do\"", "This seems insane to have to lie to have someone arrive on time!", "Had a friend who always blamed her kids for being 1-2 hours late for everything.  Usually for events FOR the kids.  The oldest one would be mad because she was always late for his stuff and he was waiting on her (sporting event, Scouts, school, etc) so it got to a point where others who were going to the same place would stop and pick him up while she wrangled herself and her younger kids to get ready.  We started giving her a different start time, usually 2 hours prior to the event, so she would show up around event start time.   Shouldn't have to manage friends this way,but you do what you must...", "Yeah how long does it take to get dressed? NTA", "> Furthermore, it's not fair to expect your girlfriend to take all the blame for being late\n\nWhy? She was the sole reason for being late. \n\n> especially when you could have just waited for her\n\nThen they\u2019d BOTH be late because of the girlfriend.\n\n> or found a compromise (such as taking separate cars\n\nThey went separately.\n\nCan you stop infantilising this woman? She\u2019s responsible for her actions and their consequences.", "How did you write so much here yet not understand anything in the post?  OP did take separate cars.  Waiting for her would have made them both late.  OP didn't lie to her parents because she WAS still getting dressed.  No one in a relationship is responsible for their partner's actions.  That's what parents do with their children, not partners with each other.", "It was clear that he left without her, because she was still getting dressed. And you suggest taking separate cars as a compromise, but op did one better and got a ride so they could still drive home together after the party. He did communicate that it was important for him to be on time, but she ignored it. I don't know what he could have done to compromise beyond what he already did.", "Yeah, no.  If someone is late, it's their fault.  His expectations that she get ready on time are perfectly reasonable.  He held up his end of the communication by telling her when they needed to leave in advance.  She then dropped the ball because she can't manage her own time.", "Found the girlfriend.", "Women and men alike both whine too.", "> You\u2019re a little bit of an AH for saying she was whining, though - children whine, using that term to describe an adult woman\u2019s behavior comes across as condescend and a bit sexist.\n\nLmao. You\u2019ve clearly never been on this sub enough if you haven\u2019t read men being described as whiners.", "I've never said anything about her hair. \n\nI'm not sure but she keeps it straight throughout the week and curls it only on special occasions. \n\nIt's not a source of insecurity if that's what your thinking and we're both Asian.", "She\u2019s a grown ass woman who needs to take some accountability lol. Why enable that shit?", "I used to do this with my dad, but like by 2-4 hours off. The latest he's ever been for something with me was 18 hours. Every time I'd call and check, he'd say they're in the car, just waiting on one person in the bathroom or something. He only lived an hour away too. Impossible to plan anything with a habitually late person.", "We did this with my mother.", "Alex: *decomposes*", "I've seen a few.  One where a mother was always 3 hours late.  So, the poster had a special invitation written for her mother, 3 hours earlier than the actual time.  She got there on time and was happy everyone waited for her.\n\nUntil she discovered the ruse and blew her top.  Obviously, I considered the mother there the AH because she couldn't even get to her own child's wedding on time without needing such a ruse.", "I like to think I have raised whining into an art-form. You name, it I can whine about it. My whining doesnt even make sense most of the time.\n\nYou should try it some time. Its quite refreshing!", "To be fair, you did describe her hair as \"very untamable\" in the post which could be seen as an insult. TIL there is a condition called uncombable hair syndrome UCH that occurs in children. I don't think your girlfriend has UCH, she may just have terrible time management skills.", "Wait- your dad was EIGHTEEN HOURS late to something?!", "So like he was supposed to be there at 6pm but showed up the next day at noon? That's insane!", "That's wild. That mom is an AH for being late usually but also for expecting people to HOLD THE WEDDING for her to get there late. Time to stop inviting that person to things...", "It's not the adhd that's the self control issue. It's the adapting to it to function well in a society that's not catered to your needs. \n\nYou and your husband have to self control to adapt to it, albeit in different ways. \n\nOps gf doesn't, because even with prompting and knowing it's an issue, she still blames op for her failure to be on time.", "And some people haven't found the way that works for them yet. Its definitely not something everyone with ADHD just figures out.", "Right, but it's your self control and will to do these things that manage your ADHD and make it so you're still on time.", "I too am ND and until recently didn\u2019t know this is called *time blindness*. Alarms only help me so much. I have to set back the clocks that don\u2019t reset, like microwave, stove, etc., and need constant check-in reminders from a human or AI. I do try my absolute best, and it\u2019s not because I don\u2019t value someone else\u2019s time.", "She should be the one kicked to the curb. He told the truth. It\u2019s not his fault she didn\u2019t care about the party for his friend. She had no remorse", "LOL! He should be so lucky!  This guy is way too patient with her.  It's one thing to be annoyed for this.  It's another to be yelled at because she couldn't manage her time.", "Seemed to be an awfully calm response to demeaningly tell someone to calm down from.  I'm thinking you're overly defensive about your own incorrect statement.", "If you live your life by the rule that you should \u2018back your partner up no matter what\u2019, then I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re the one that needs to grow up. See, you might think it seems mature and romantic, but all you\u2019re advertising is that you lack the autonomy and intelligence to think for yourself. It\u2019s also the hallmark of a relationship rife with insecurities; if you can\u2019t challenge your partner when they are patently wrong then it\u2019s a pretty weak relationship.", "Oh, I thought your default was to tell people who you disagree with to calm down.  It's refreshing you have so many inapplicable responses from which to pull.", "Calm down.", "Yup, picking me and my brother up for a vacation.", "I think he ended up showing up at about 3am for a vacation. By then my mom and stepdad were so pissed they had to be convinced to even let my brother and I go on the trip. My dad's nickname in his bad was \"Tony Late\" for a good reason.", "Agreed. I set my phone 5 mins in the future to try to be more on time. time blindness can also be having literally no idea how long something will take so preparing is hard.", "Have you checked with Guinness to see if you have some kind of record on your hands, here?", "Found the gf", "Lol, it's a little late now since it was in highschool, but it would have been worth checking into it at the time. He would have framed it realistically."]}
