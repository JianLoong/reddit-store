That being said, it's also understandable to feel frustrated when someone takes an excessive amount of time to get ready for an event that you both agreed to attend.\n\nIn this case, it sounds like you did try to communicate with your girlfriend about the importance of leaving on time, and she chose to ignore your requests.

It's understandable that you didn't want to admit that you left without her, but lying to her parents could come across as immature and dishonest.\n\nFurthermore, it's not fair to expect your girlfriend to take all the blame for being late, especially when you could have just waited for her or found a compromise (such as taking separate cars). In a relationship, it's important to work together as a team, and that means taking responsibility for each other's actions.\n\nSo, in conclusion, while you may not be the asshole for leaving without your girlfriend, it's important to consider how your actions could have been perceived and how you can improve your communication and teamwork in the future.", "ESH\n\nI don\u2019t blame you for leaving early but you should have made a better excuse and she probably would have let things slide.", "ESH. if it were one of my bf\u2019s best mates and I was running late I would\u2019ve volunteered that I could come later. \n\nI agree w your gf that a relationship is like being a team but in this scenario I think she didn\u2019t pull her weight as a good team mate to be ready on time. It\u2019s unfair to you to always be late to things because of how long it takes her to get ready. She is the AH. You need to be careful about how to talk to her about this. Perhaps you need to sit down and figure out what being a good teammate consists of. \n\nImagine if it were a sports team and you had kick off at 8pm would the rest of the team wait for the player who is late or is it the player who is late who is letting down the team?\n\nYou are the slight AH for saying she is still getting ready when you could\u2019ve made a more socially acceptable excuse", "Speaking as a chronically late person, NTA for leaving or being honest with her parents about why she was late.  \n\nYou\u2019re a little bit of an AH for saying she was whining, though - children whine, using that term to describe an adult woman\u2019s behavior comes across as condescend and a bit sexist.

That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t argue or go your own ways when you can\u2019t reach an agreement, but it should mean that even when you\u2019re fighting you speak to and about each other with respect.", "The answer at my house is to tell dad everything starts a half hour earlier.", "Sounds like she missed out on a fun event and a responsible partner, her loss.", "Narrator: I\u2019ll take Questions With No As An Answer for $1000 Alex", "100% agree.
