She's an academic and works as an assistant professor in a major city in the next state, although she doesn't go to campus every day (she works from home the rest of the time).  My husband (42M) and I stopped by their house a while to for an unexpected visit, and were shocked that their house was a bit unorganized.  It wasn't horrible, but the floors could've been vacuumed and there were dirty dishes in the sink.  My cousin's wife does most of the cleaning, but ever since she started her new job, she's had less time for it because she's always grading or teaching.  My cousin doesn't clean much because his dad is very traditional about gender roles and didn't raise him to help his wife clean the house.  My cousin's wife has done a good job in teaching him to do more around the house, but it's been a long process.  \n\nWhen my cousin's wife had a birthday recently, my sister (45F) and I decided to buy her a Roomba to help her keep the house clean.  My cousin had privately apologized to me after my last visit, for the house not being as clean as it could've been, so my sister and I thought that the Roomba would be useful for her.  Well, apparently it wasn't.  She got upset at the implications that she was a bad housekeeper and that it was solely her responsibility to clean, instead of our encouraging our cousin to help her more often.  The thing that angered me was that my cousin's wife donated the Roomba to Goodwill - if she didn't want the gift, she could've returned it to me so my sister and I could've gotten our money back.  I don't think that I'm TA, because she could use the help, but now my cousin tells me that my cousin's wife is still upset and won't come to family gatherings.  The holidays are coming up, and everyone will ask where she is when she doesn't show up.  My cousin is mad because he'll be in the middle and forced to explain her absence diplomatically.

Cousin's wife also said she works from home - what do you think that means?

The robot arrived two days later before I could order one myself and it was labelled as a housewarming gift for the both of us (but really it was for me because of our conversation).

They\u2019ve always appreciated it.   And I never ask. I just assume they don\u2019t have some of that stuff since they live in an apartment.  I guess it\u2019s a different situation", "A vacuum has nothing to do with gender.", "My husband now was a marine, so almost too neat and orderly sometimes lol. But I won't complain as he cleans automatically and super fast!", "It would literally never be convenient, though, would it?  When we're sleeping?  When my cat is dead (indoor only, so she only leaves when I take her to the vet)?  When we're home and don't want distractions?  Also, I have only one rug downstairs where people are likely to be and it's - you guessed it - in my husband's office.  Though, come to think of it, it could be the impetus ro rip it out and put in hardwoods, like we keep saying we will.", "I was very glad I went for the cheaper option which didn't include the app. As annoying as trying to find the thing or figure out what was wrong was, at least it didn't send me messages lol", "A diffuser used on low or cool doesn't damage hair. The Shark has that. There are studies out there that say air drying is more damaging because of the length of time hair is wet.", "In this exact scenario with their same dynamics, but replacing housework with yard work? Yes.", "yes.", "But that is a house-warming gift, where it would be traditional to buy something for the house.  Here, they bought her a vacuum for her birthday. Two different situations.", "K? Doesn't mean everyone else has to, what even is your point if you agree with me?", "I buy everyone with new home a new toilet plunger a Visa gift card.  Everyone needs a plunger, no matter what their gender, (and who wants to take an old, dirty plunger with them from their last place?) and they can use the gift card for whatever they want.", "If that were true, they would have given it to the husband on his birthday. You know, the person in the relationship  that doesn't do housework because he was raised and believes in gender roles. OP set back and progress her cousin may have made in her relationship.", "It's not the vacuum itself, it's the housework associated with vacuums that is gendered. It's definitely a \"traditional gender role\" for the woman to be responsible for the housework.", "Our neighbor is a former Marine. He's the one you want at the annual block party. Besides being a gregarious, likable fella, when it comes time to break down and clean up, clock work.", "IMO the constant connection to all of these random devices is so annoying. Feels like a lot of devices have that as a selling point now and I'm like... no thanks, I don't need my dishwasher or rice cooker to tell me it's done? I'll just listen for the beep or time it!", "Hmm, I didn\u2019t know that. That is very helpful information, thank you.", "Ah idk any man who would get upset that they got a lawn mower for their birthday if they own a house", "I don\u2019t agree with you. I said I understand your point of view", "They need a lil help cleaning now. Not during his birthday.   And it is true? If it has nothing to do with gender why would I wait to give it to the man. It doesn\u2019t matter", "So it\u2019s not the vacuum, just the idea around a vacuum. Idk it seems kind of silly and like a non issue to me. Do you know why women are looked at as the cleaners traditionally ? Because they are better at it. Yea the dude in this instance needs to help more but I really don\u2019t see an issue. Maybe I\u2019m out of touch idk. My gf has gotten a vacuum, kitchen knife set, a kitchen aid, my mom bought her a Sam\u2019s club pack of disinfectant wipes.  She was grateful for it all", "You've never met my father. \n\nSo I'll just say one little thing to add to the thread. \n\nWhat makes OP the asshole is the fact that the gift was never mentioned to be a want of the Cousin's wife.\n\nI am all for useful gifts rather than bullshit that sits on the shelf getting dusty. But that is only when someone specifically hints at it or so on.\n\nIf cousins wife mentioned having a hard time keeping on top of the house chores, needing a new vacuum, or that she always wanted a roomba, it would have been a perfectly thoughtful gift. \n\nBut the fact that OP has clearly stated that the house had floors that needed vacuuming and the dishes not being done, makes him a huge asshole for giving her a gift that she never needed nor wanted. \n\nIt is just as disrespectful as the post of the husband gifting the wife pots for Xmas. \n\nNot everyone finds priority in keeping the house sparkly  clean. Especially when she's studying and working at the same time! I wouldn't wanna waste my only free time cleaning the house and catering a good for nothing husband! \n\nThe fact that the husband apologised for the mess is funny as fuck. And the fact that OP has \"justified\" his cousin behaviour as \"that's the way he was brought up\" says a lot. \n\nWanna make a thoughtful gift? Get her a sexy housewife costume in the cousin's size and convince cousin to do housechores with it on for his wife!\n\nThat would be greatly appreciated as it is clearly something that bothers her that he doesn't clean. Would get a laugh out of her while also not having to worry about unexpected guests.\n\nOP is literally the reincarnation of my mother's worst fear. The house can never be in any way unpresentable \"what if someone comes in\" like wtf she'd want it clean for burglars cause obv. They'd be like \"eww I'm not gonna steal this house cause its too dirty\" lol.\nOr \"never wear underwear that's not perfectly new in case you have a car accident and have to be stripped by the paramedics to save your life\". As if they'd give a flying fudge that I have panties with pink butterflies and a small hole on the side. \n\nDon't show up when  not invited. If you do, be respectful of the space", "My husband would.  He's an engineer.  It took him three months just to pick out the one he wanted, never mind the additional month and a half to have it shipped to us.  And why that one?  It's electric, quiet, gets rave reviews, has a battery that is interchangeable with other lawn items by the same manufacturer, and is light enough for me to use (I have terrible arthritis, but I still help with house maintenance, because it's my house, too).  If someone gave him a different one, he'd have asked them to take it back or given it away to the first person who wanted it.  Don't assume all men are the same.", "I think that's enough commenting for you today, you're barely making any sense anymore. If you understand, why are you arguing and throwing out hypotheticals like they mean anything?\n\nAnyways, bye.", "Birthday gifts are typically intended to be specifically for the recipient, and people generally try to give thoughtful, personal gifts. Your gift to her was impersonal and judgmental. And as it was given to HER, she was free to give it to Goodwill or run over it with her car.", "It matters if you were raised with strict gender roles that you want to break free of. I was raised that way and gifting a household appliance is offensive to me and people like me. It is a very sensitive subject. My kids would not see it that way because they weren't raised to believe only women do all the housework.", "You\u2019re just spinning your wheels, defending yourself for your AH gift. YTA.", "> Do you know why women are looked at as the cleaners traditionally ? Because they are better at it.\n\nWhat the actual F???? NO, women are not \u201cbetter\u201d at cleaning.", "I never expressed a desire or need for a new lawn mower to my wife. For my birthday she went out and bought me a top of the line electric lawnmower. Ya know what? I spent all summer mowing the lawn feeling like I was Tony Stark! I think sometimes people can see what you need more than you can and they're actually doing a nice thing for you.", "Ok fair enough But would he give it to the Salvation Army?", "That\u2019s why you give them the receipt so they can trade it in if they want", "Why would someone be upset after getting a free gift. I understand disappointed but upset?", "You do realize Its possible to understand your reasoning and still disagree right?", "Yea they are. Look up the studies on it, it\u2019s because statistically they are more likely to not rush and have a high attention to details. There\u2019s studies on this.  Not that a man can\u2019t be a cleaning wizard and a woman can\u2019t be a mess but that\u2019s the way most of us are wired as humans. It\u2019s not a secret or sexist. It\u2019s a statistical fact wether you like it or not"]}
