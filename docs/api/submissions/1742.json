She's an academic and works as an assistant professor in a major city in the next state, although she doesn't go to campus every day (she works from home the rest of the time).  My husband (42M) and I stopped by their house a while to for an unexpected visit, and were shocked that their house was a bit unorganized.  It wasn't horrible, but the floors could've been vacuumed and there were dirty dishes in the sink.  My cousin's wife does most of the cleaning, but ever since she started her new job, she's had less time for it because she's always grading or teaching.  My cousin doesn't clean much because his dad is very traditional about gender roles and didn't raise him to help his wife clean the house.  My cousin's wife has done a good job in teaching him to do more around the house, but it's been a long process.  \n\nWhen my cousin's wife had a birthday recently, my sister (45F) and I decided to buy her a Roomba to help her keep the house clean.  My cousin had privately apologized to me after my last visit, for the house not being as clean as it could've been, so my sister and I thought that the Roomba would be useful for her.  Well, apparently it wasn't.  She got upset at the implications that she was a bad housekeeper and that it was solely her responsibility to clean, instead of our encouraging our cousin to help her more often.  The thing that angered me was that my cousin's wife donated the Roomba to Goodwill - if she didn't want the gift, she could've returned it to me so my sister and I could've gotten our money back.  I don't think that I'm TA, because she could use the help, but now my cousin tells me that my cousin's wife is still upset and won't come to family gatherings.  The holidays are coming up, and everyone will ask where she is when she doesn't show up.  My cousin is mad because he'll be in the middle and forced to explain her absence diplomatically.

Cousin's wife also said she works from home - what do you think that means?

The robot arrived two days later before I could order one myself and it was labelled as a housewarming gift for the both of us (but really it was for me because of our conversation).

It doubled as a sexist, gross judgement.", "YTA.  What in this messed up world made you think that getting someone a cleaning device as a gift would be received as anything other than you judging their cleaning skills as lacking?

That\u2019s a clearly sent message of \u201cyour house isn\u2019t up to my standards and I think you need to be doing more\u201d plus an added \u201cyou\u2019re a woman so eff your hobbies you should be cleaning\u201d on top.

If someone gifted me a roomba because they saw my floors were dirty and my husband is too useless to help, I'd be so happy. Lol They can't buy me a better husband, but I'll take an automatic floor cleaning vacuum! The house is cleaner and I didn't have to pay a cent for it. And if I really didn't want it, I'd sell it. Why in the world would you pass up free money? IMO the cousin is way too uptight. If other people's supposed sexism gets them to buy me useful items, so be it.   \n\n\nAlso, I'm kinda reading between the lines here and it seems like this is probably a culture that highly values home cleanliness. I come from a culture like that as well. So I believe OP when she says she was just trying to help her cousin.", "All these ppl say you are the A but personally when I was struggling post accident I would have cried tears of joy to have a roomba. I don't think it's a mean gift, it's thoughtful. It's one less thing they have to worry over. Yeah the spouse could do more , but he's not and this will just take away one tiny piece of stress. NTA to me", "YTA. Now if you had given it to your cousin as a gift it would have been awesome.", "NTA.  You know how expensive a Roomba is?  People need to be able to receive feedback.  OP was trying to help a family member whose life got busier.  If my family saw my front lawn disheveled growing weeds and they want to chip in for one of those robot lawn mower or a gardener, I\u2019ll return their generosity LOL.", "YTA. You should have gifted her an subscription for eharmony so she could find a new husband who isnt a useless sexist vegetable.", "YTA. She works. He works. Sometimes they don\u2019t have time to clean.

My SIL asked for a new vacuum last Christmas, so we got one as a joint gift for her and my brother not just for her.", "YTA.  You should have gifted the vacuum to her husband at his birthday.\n\nAnd also, you don\u2019t get to dictate what someone does with a gift, especially an inconsiderate one.", "YTA  -  She should never have had to teach an adult man how to do household chores.  It sounds like you should have given the Roomba to your cousin instead.", "YTA. Gifts should be little luxuries, treats. An item used for housekeeping should NEVER be given as a gift (other than maybe a wedding or housewarming), especially to a woman, unless the honoree specifically asks for it.\n\nOne year my husband gave me a vacuum cleaner for my birthday and cookware for Christmas.

She knew that you had seen a little mess before and were implying she couldn't handle it. \n\nAlso it was a gift to her, that means she can use it how she sees fit, including donate it. It wasn't yours anymore so you have no right to be mad at what she does with it. Wanting the money back for it does not help your case.

It doesn't need to be as big of a deal as it has been allowed to become.", "YTA - pro tip, unless it\u2019s on her birthday wish list you never buy cleaning supplies or household items for a woman for her birthday. Never. Ever. Not even if you think you\u2019re being helpful. I\u2019m surprised you even thought this was okay.", "But but OP was just encouraging his cousin to clean more!

Like don't get me wrong I love presents that are decorative or if someone gets me something they know I will like but I love practical gifts. I want a new vacuum but the one I want is over $400. Its a Dyson that is wireless and you put this thing on your wall to hang it up and it charges in that and you can break it down to a handheld or use the attachments and it's really cool to me and my mom has one but I cannot justify spending $400+ when I have a perfectly good vacuum that works just fine. I happened to ask my partner one year if he would be willing to gift it to me for Christmas even though we don't really exchange Christmas presents. He said no for one really simple reason. You don't give cleaning things as presents. It implies something about the recipient. You just don't do it.

But that's because she was watching me mop the kitchen tile with a regular mop after I spilled juice and my entire downstairs is tile, and she knew how much easier it would be to do the floors. And when it arrived, she made sure her son knew how it worked as well (she got us the same model she has).", "I have high pile rugs on top of thick rug pads.

I would be ecstatic to get a Roomba!!", "YTA Instead of a gift you gave her a $400 criticism, and you think you have any reason to be made?

If it had been a joint Christmas present or something, in addition to an individual present, a roomba could be a useful gift. A helping hand around the house, a practical gift like those cooking sets some people buy for a new home.\n\nGiving a roomba as her sole birthday present, after judging the state of her house (which her husband could just as easily have cleaned) is a dick move. Instead of \"happy birthday, here's a little something I hope you'll like!\", your 'gift' conveyed the message \"you're a bad housekeeper, but it's alright, I brought something that will do your job for you\". Why not give a gift intended for her as a person? Maybe she likes chocolate or wine. Maybe she's been interested in a certain hobby or wanting to read a certain book.

I, personally, would appreciate the roomba *but* it sounds like this is a source of tension between your cousin & wife, since he doesn\u2019t pull his weight at home and she seems to feel your gift added to the pressure to work and provide AND be the apparent sole house cleaner. I don\u2019t think you had ill intentions.

First of all, who comes to someone's home uninvited and gets upset that the house isn't perfectly clean? Second of all, why should it be just your cousin's wife job? Because she's a woman?
