There\u2019s me (35F), Amy (33) and Julie (30.)\n\nIn 2019, Julie\u2019s son was a few months old and had a serious health issue. He needed significant hospital treatment and even with insurance and Julie and my BIL managing to front some money, they still had around $10,000 in debt. I\u2019m not drowning in money by any means but I am financially stable and do not have any kids to provide for and I never loan money so this was an exception. Julie approached me and asked if it was possible I could lend them the money as they were struggling to keep their house and afford living expenses. I said yes in a heartbeat as that money went straight to my nephews care. Julie, my BIL and I worked together with a fixed summary of how much they could realistically afford each month to pay me back. They even paid extra when they could and they paid me back every dollar. My point is, my sister didn\u2019t flake on me and only came to me because she was desperate and stuck to her word of paying it back. \n\nAmy has recently asked me if she could borrow $3000 for her and her two daughters. She is currently divorcing the kids dad so I assumed she has been struggling money wise due to an increase in costs and because she is now living on her own. I asked her if she needed help with rent, groceries, stuff for the kids etc. she said she\u2019s doing fine money wise but that she really wants to take her kids to Disney for a few days as both are sad about the parental split and she wants to spoil them. She said she would have to save for a long period to take them away but wants to take them this spring.\n\nI told her no. I said I\u2019m not paying for a vacation she doesn\u2019t need and that I feel for the kids but that going away for a few days is something she\u2019ll have to pay for herself and I reminded her I don\u2019t loan out money and that Julie was an exception. Well, she is calling me an AH for helping Julie out and not her. I told her Julie and our BIL had a literal sick child and that my money helped them from becoming homeless and bankrupting them. She said that she \u2018needs help just as much as Julie\u2019 by giving her kids \u2018something nice to look forward to.\u2019\n\nMy family have been dragged into this and my parents have been pressuring me to just this once \u2018bend\u2019 my rule again as the \u2018grandkids are suffering.\u2019 I told them if they\u2019re that desperate for my nieces to go to Disney, why can\u2019t they pay for it? Their counter to that is that Amy asked me, not them and that they\u2019re \u2018retired and not in a position to lend money whereas you are\u2019. Julie says Amy is being an entitled bitch and just to ignore her.\n\nETA: the loan to Julie was made public by a slip up by her and my BIL. They were under constant stress and pressure and getting questioned all the time by our parents and Amy about how they were able to pay off the debt and they just let it slip. I don\u2019t blame them for cracking and letting slip at all. They were in an impossible situation.", "created_utc": 1674224941, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gybvc/aita_for_lending_money_to_one_sister_and_not_the/", "score": 230, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What utter bullcrap. Op ask her to take a bank loan or something for this emergency. NTA", "NTA", "NTA.

The parents say she should loan her other sister the money for a vacation, but they can't since they are retired.  Well, I bet they could get a credit card with a $3000 to $4000 limit on it and give it their divorced daughter to use on her vacation. Then they can have the daughter pay off the credit card each month.  See how that works.  If the kids are in such dire need, why not ask the ex-husband to pay half?  Likely because youngest daughter is entitled and that is why she is getting a divorce.  She can go to a bank and get herself a loan too, if she has a history of managing her credit appropriately.", "nta", "I like that idea. OP deserves a disney trip and I bet those kids could use a break from both parents", "I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to go on vacation just me and the kids.

She has some money and just wants to use OP's money as a cushion.", "Holy cow, if the kids need something nice to look forward to, tell them you'll take them out for ice cream or something, not the most expensive kid vacation ever, LOL!", "I don\u2019t plan on lending money again", "Would be a great solution", "Completely understandable. It\u2019s your time and money, you can do with it what you please."]}
