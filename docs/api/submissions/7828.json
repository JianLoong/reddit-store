There\u2019s me (35F), Amy (33) and Julie (30.)\n\nIn 2019, Julie\u2019s son was a few months old and had a serious health issue. He needed significant hospital treatment and even with insurance and Julie and my BIL managing to front some money, they still had around $10,000 in debt. I\u2019m not drowning in money by any means but I am financially stable and do not have any kids to provide for and I never loan money so this was an exception. Julie approached me and asked if it was possible I could lend them the money as they were struggling to keep their house and afford living expenses. I said yes in a heartbeat as that money went straight to my nephews care. Julie, my BIL and I worked together with a fixed summary of how much they could realistically afford each month to pay me back. They even paid extra when they could and they paid me back every dollar. My point is, my sister didn\u2019t flake on me and only came to me because she was desperate and stuck to her word of paying it back. \n\nAmy has recently asked me if she could borrow $3000 for her and her two daughters. She is currently divorcing the kids dad so I assumed she has been struggling money wise due to an increase in costs and because she is now living on her own. I asked her if she needed help with rent, groceries, stuff for the kids etc. she said she\u2019s doing fine money wise but that she really wants to take her kids to Disney for a few days as both are sad about the parental split and she wants to spoil them. She said she would have to save for a long period to take them away but wants to take them this spring.\n\nI told her no. I said I\u2019m not paying for a vacation she doesn\u2019t need and that I feel for the kids but that going away for a few days is something she\u2019ll have to pay for herself and I reminded her I don\u2019t loan out money and that Julie was an exception. Well, she is calling me an AH for helping Julie out and not her. I told her Julie and our BIL had a literal sick child and that my money helped them from becoming homeless and bankrupting them. She said that she \u2018needs help just as much as Julie\u2019 by giving her kids \u2018something nice to look forward to.\u2019\n\nMy family have been dragged into this and my parents have been pressuring me to just this once \u2018bend\u2019 my rule again as the \u2018grandkids are suffering.\u2019 I told them if they\u2019re that desperate for my nieces to go to Disney, why can\u2019t they pay for it? Their counter to that is that Amy asked me, not them and that they\u2019re \u2018retired and not in a position to lend money whereas you are\u2019. Julie says Amy is being an entitled bitch and just to ignore her.\n\nETA: the loan to Julie was made public by a slip up by her and my BIL. They were under constant stress and pressure and getting questioned all the time by our parents and Amy about how they were able to pay off the debt and they just let it slip. I don\u2019t blame them for cracking and letting slip at all. They were in an impossible situation.\n\nETA 2: I haven\u2019t replied to a ton of comments but I did mention the story back to Amy\u2019s divorce. If you\u2019re interested feel free to read it. It\u2019s a shit show. The divorce is kinda all on my sister so this may be a contributing factor in my refusal to lend her money. Infidelity was involved and it\u2019s a bitter split.\n\nETA 3: this is the comment I made about Amy\u2019s divorce so you have full context. \n\n\u2018Man the divorce is a whole other issue. He was working long hours and she felt lonely and started getting close to a coworker of her own. She had some kind of emotional affair, he found out and a whole shitshow started. They kept on arguing and he said that she was cheating on him and she claimed she wasn\u2019t. She decided to be petty and slept with someone else and said \u2018this is what cheating looks like.\u2019 He then threw her out as his parents owned their house. She tried to take the girls and refuse access and he said basically good luck. They\u2019ve been arguing ever since and I feel sorry for the kids\u2019\n\nETA 4; I love my nieces and nephew but going to Disney with kids sounds like my idea of hell lol!", "created_utc": 1674224941, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gybvc/aita_for_lending_money_to_one_sister_and_not_the/", "score": 962, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A Disney vacation is an expensive distraction for to remedy a family issue she caused. So if you lend her the $3K, you will likely never see it paid back to you in full or at all. She will expect you to forgive her loan when and if her single status living situation does cause her real financial strain. As sister is still in the divorce proceedings, she probably will be incurring more personal debts. And chances are she\u2019s going to come to you again for more $ to help finance her when this happens. Now that would be an emergency maybe worthy of a loan. Though again be prepared for her to expect any previous loans if not already repaid to be forgiven. As for the idea instead of the $3K loan. How about you finance a nice spa and lunch day at her favorite spa for her and her girls? $500 should do it. I would present it as a gift card to them. They can take selfies of their day of pampering for the great memories. The point of the day is to spend quality time together during a difficult time.
