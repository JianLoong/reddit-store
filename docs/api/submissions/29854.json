She has a son, Nathan (9m), with her ex Mark (36m). Sara has full  custody of Nathan with her ex having scheduled visitations one weekend of every month. Sara and Nathan moved in with me a little over a year and a half ago and in my perspective, it was a little rocky at first. I've always been pretty protective of my space so making room for two other people was difficult for me. When Sara moved in with me we agreed that the visitations for Mark would be held in our apartment as long as I'm home. The main reason I wanted this is because I don't know Mark that well, and I don't want him wandering around our apartment without me there. When we proposed this idea to Mark, he was fine with it.\n\nNow moving on to the real issue. Three weeks ago marked four months since Mark's last visit so I had asked Sara when he was planning on visiting Nathan. My gf replied by shrugging her shoulders and telling me she'd ask. She never followed up with it. So a few days ago, I asked when Mark's next visit was and Sara said she'd tell me when she knew. Nathan was in the living room but had apparently overheard us and shouted something along the lines of \"dad was here last weekend remember\". Sara's face immediately dropped and when I asked what Nathan meant, she wouldn't give me a direct answer.   \nEventually she ended up telling me that for the past two visits, Mark had been to our apartment when I was working. When I accused her of going back on our agreement, she kept telling me this was her home too and she could invite whoever she wanted, and that it was fine because she was here and watching. I told her that was besides the point and she violated my trust. It blew up into a huge argument with ended in me telling her to get out of my apartment. She packed up and left with Nathan. Last I heard she was staying with her parents.   \nI've gotten several messages from both Sara and her parents calling me an asshole for kicking Sara and Nathan out of their home for something so small. She's even been blasting me on Instagram and Facebook about how horrible I am to do this to her. It's got me thinking I might be the AH but I'm not entirely sure yet.

All the folks voting YTA are deluded.  She lied about her ex visiting when you weren\u2019t home (something she agreed to) instead of discussing the need for changing the agreement in advance.  Why doesn\u2019t the ex meet with his child at his place?", "NTA. If she thought it was 'fine' for her ex to visit your apartment, she would have said something and she did not. In fact, she hid the fact that he'd been there not once but twice. This was a clear boundary and she crossed it. That's a red flag there and I'm not sure you should be in a relationship with her after this.", "NTA. While your reaction may have been on the harsh side, her initial attempts to dodge responsibility for breaking your trust is a major red flag. And her and her families continuing to put all the  blame on you shows that she is not really committed to your relationship.", "she  hid from you for a reason. what else she hiding?", "NTA\n\nRules were set. All parties agreed. End of story. If we agree with these rules or not doesn't matter, everyone in that post agreed and that's all that matters here.\n\nThat fully aside *she lied*, not just that but lied about seeing her ex secretely. And at that point she can't be trusted anymore and the rules become kind of irrelevant. She could have easily said \"OP, Mark only can come over while you are at work, is there a way we can make that happen?\" instead of going behind OP's back, sneaking him in and hiding it from OP. \n\n>She's even been blasting me on Instagram and Facebook about how horrible I am to do this to her.\n\nI bet she leaves out the part where she lied to you about secretely meeting her ex.... Because that would suddenly make your reaction very understandable.", "NTA. She does have the right to bring people into the home as you become a couple and has moved in. But that doesn\u2019t extend in any way to her ex. Even if they\u2019re 100% over and they aren\u2019t still having an affair (which I wouldn\u2019t believe if I were you), you had a clear agreement on how his visitation would be handled.", "ESH. She shouldn't have lied and that's weird. But, dude... you kicked them out like they were guests. You just said they've been living there for a year and a half.  \n\n\nYou kicked a child out of his home instantly on a whim, for something he had nothing to do with. WTF.  \nI hope at least you consider this a break up and are done with them both in your life, because if you have any notion of treating this as a standard couple's dispute that needs resolving after THAT....", "You\u2019re not TA for being upset but you\u2019re certainly the AH for even implementing this rule for as long as you have for two people you\u2019re supposed to love. They\u2019re not roommates, this is your romantic partner and her child. The way you talk about *their* home like it\u2019s only yours is wild. And you\u2019re definitely an AH for kicking her out with a child.", "The rule about you supervising the dad and not thinking her supervision was good enough is kind of stupid. That was supposed to be her home too. You\u2019ve been living together long enough that, even if that rule seemed appropriate at the beginning, you should have relaxed it after 18 months. Living with a woman with a kid means co-parenting with the father will be a part of your life. \n\nHowever, she outright lied to you and put a CHILD in the middle of that dishonesty. That is absolutely a reason to end a relationship. Lying about something she disagrees with, even though it\u2019s stupid, would lead me to wonder what else she lies about. \n\nAnyway, I think both of you were wrong. ESH", "NTA. She lied to you about it more than once. If she was unhappy with the agreement, she should have discussed it with you.", "ESH.\n\nWe see honest communication as one person's responsibilty but it's actually not. It's the responsibility of one to speak the truth and the other to make it safe to.\n\nYou made a point of saying them moving into \"your\" space was tough.. do you think she ever truly felt secure there? As in, if she says or does something you don't approve you wouldn't just kick her out? Lol.. \n\nI'm not excusing her deceit, because it isn't ok. But had she come to you to talk would you have been open and approachable about it? Are you an emotionally safe person? \n\nKinda feels like the answer to that is in your subject line. \n\nIt was never \"our home\", only yours and you allowed them to live there. \n\nProbably a good thing that it's over.", "ESH\n\nSara should have been honest and discussed it again with you as some time has passed by since the rule was set in place. I fully agree she should not have done this behind your back. However, the rule itself is silly considering there are scheduled visitations rights for Nathans father and Sara should be able to let father and son meet at her living space (which at the time was the apartment). She is an a-hole for not discussing it beforehand.\n\nYou however are also the a-hole. You are fully claiming the apartment as only your home, when Sarah and Nathan have been living with you in this apartment for over a year now. It is also their home, even if it is legally in your name. You just kicking her and her young son out is very drastic. She broke the rule, but a mature discussion could have been had as all she did was let the father of her child inside her home for visitation purposes. It makes me wonder what stopped her from trying to talk you again before she let the ex enter the apartment in which she too lives (or lived).", "ESH. Her for lying and you for this rule and just kicking thrm out. If you're not honestly prepared to share your living space where the other person gets the same rights as you don't move in with someone else, especially when this involves a kid.", "YTA.  Seriously you ended a 4 year relationship over her letting her sons father visit for a few hours?  You obviously never cared about her or her son.", "Not the asshole!\n\nIt\u2019s your space, and you voiced that it made you uneasy to have him there without you. She not only went against your agreement but also lied to your face about it! Feels like there is more going on there\u2026. No one innocent just immediately gets this defensive", "ESH (except the kid, obvs!!)\nShe shouldn\u2019t have breached your trust and lied to you. But you shouldn\u2019t have such a ridiculous rule indefinitely. Assuming you knew that visitation was done in that way, you added a massive layer of hurdle to cross, basically saying that it had to be at your convenience.", "Eh... ESH. If, after a year and a half, you think your girlfriend incapable of inviting anyone over to your *shared living space* without your approval or supervision, then that's a shit thing and you're not ready to have actual people in your life. Get a fish tank.\n\nShe should have told you he was coming over to see his son. Not asked, not suggested, just given you a heads up.\n\nWhy live together, build a relationship, if you have to pretend to be her father and approve of everyone she has over? Do you also look through her phone and fb to make sure she's only talked to people you approve of? Do you keep an eye on her while she's at work lest she speak with someone you don't like?\n\nShe sucks for not just saying \"no\" to your supervision nonsense far sooner, and you just suck all around \ud83d\ude05 You should really update it to say your \"ex gf.\" Your relationship was over the instant you told her to get out because someone else took a breath without you being there to monitor it.", "Seem to be going against the trend here, but YTA. She absolutely shouldn't have lied about him coming over, that part is on her. But it seems from your description that you've been very clear about it being your house, despite her and her son also living there, and with how quick you are to kick them out, it sounds like you've made her feel like it can stop being her house real quick. Stop looking at this as your girlfriend sneaking in a secret meeting with her ex, and start seeing it as her letting her son's father see his kid. You only allow supervised meetings with him? I know I'd get tired of that real quick. Either you trust her or you don't. Either it's her house too, or it's not.", "ESH. Her for lying to you, which is the only thing that keeps it from being a Y T A. You for being so controlling. You've been living together for a year and a half now. When is it going to be 'our' house and not 'my' house? You kicked out someone that technically can make your life a living hell. She's a mom with a child. She has claimed residency. FOR A YEAR AND A HALF. And because you're in your controlling feels, you kicked her and her son out of OUR home. And yes, after all this time, it should be OUR. \n\nThe fact you don't get that is likely why she's been hemming and hawing over being honest with you. Her ex doesn't need you hovering. He's not going to piss on your bed or fuck his ex on it. What exactly do you think he's going to do? You just want to entirely control the situation, and that's where you become the ahole. Yes, she lied. That's where she effed up. But question: has she tried to talk to you at all in the year and a half that you being there isn't necessary? I think she has and I think you blew her off.\n\nSo this whole time, she's been living on tenterhooks, wondering when you're going to blow up and throw her out of YOUR home. You've given her no permanence in a place she should feel comfortable in. You shouldn't be dating. Or more to the point, you shouldn't be dating a parent if you want this much control over a child that isn't yours.", "ESH.  The GF is an a\\*\\* for breaking trust and lying.  YTA for tossing a 9 year old boy out for something that was not his fault.  You could have given some time to find new housing, instead you made them immediately leave YOUR apartment.  Which makes you the bigger of the two AHs.", "I\u2019m going with ESH. Your gf is of course the AH for betraying that trust. If it wasn\u2019t a big issue she wouldn\u2019t have lied about it. So the fact that she did means she knew damn well it wasn\u2019t okay. \n\nWhere you\u2019re the AH is making them leave that quickly. I don\u2019t care about her but that was Nathan\u2019s home. I know what she did was wrong but he didn\u2019t deserve his life to be turned over like that and he\u2019s probably blaming himself for even saying anything. I think you should\u2019ve told her she had a specific amount of time to leave to get her ducks in a row and so Nathan didn\u2019t have to go through that. \n\nI know he\u2019s not yours and he\u2019s not your responsibility but he\u2019s still a a child who saw you everyday and you threw him out. I feel for him.", "NTA because she lied about it then tried to make it fine. Why did she do that though? Why did she feel the need to hide it ? Was it because she was scared of your answer but at the same time wanted to give the impression that you trusted her and it was her home to other people ?", "that woman and her kid are not some strays to adopt and kick out at first inconvenience. also, I don't see what gives you permission to tell when and how said kid can meet with father in his own apartment (oh, yes, you LIVE together,  you aren't renting it to them). massive asshole", "ESH. Never get involved with a woman with children if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s permanent. That poor kid. Yes she was wrong but so are you.", "NTA - shady as hell and if she can lie to you that easily she\u2019ll do it again. I\u2019d just be done with it and consider it a bullet dodged", "ESH. It's been long enough you need to loosen the reigns, it's her home too. \nBut she's also the AH for lying.", "NTA. Break up with her, nobody needs to be with an entitled attitude like that. \n\nHere\u2019s a simple question: if she was in the right, why did she lie to you and try to cover it up? \n\nI\u2019m also gonna guess she contributed little to the household. That\u2019s just gravy to go on top of the \u201cshe sucks\u201d platter, though", "INFO: Has she ever brought up the discussion of altering your agreement?  If not, then,  \n\nNTA - You had an agreement and she broke it.  \nWorse, she lied about it multiple times.\n\nBoil it down to the core and it\u2019s just that simple.", "NTA, she broke an agreement and was lying about it. There is no more to it.", "Does she pay rent? Even if she does not, what you did would be illegal in NYC. Kicking a child out on the spot is unforgivable, but breaking up w a partner is not. You should have broken up w her and given her time to move.", "ESH", "Perhaps an unpopular opinion, but though this might be a moment where you don\u2019t necessarily come across as the only asshole, infantilizing your girlfriend, and making her feel like she and her son are taking up space in *your* home, instead of living with you, is what\u2019s creating your problems. She\u2019s lying to you because you make everthing difficult. You are  acting like everything belongs to you, and that all rules that you prefer are the only reasonable ones. So I think you\u2019re probably the asshole, too. She\u2019s not trying to manipulate you, she just doesn\u2019t want to be monitored and supervised. If you have no reason to believe that she\u2019s f***ing him or sending him money, then you have no reason to tell an adult how they navigate shared custody, unless it\u2019s because you actually have everyone\u2019s best interest at heart. And I don\u2019t believe that you do. Otherwise, you would be telling us other reasons for disliking him outside of \u201cyou don\u2019t know him very well\u201d. I think that you only have your best interest in mind. So she might be an asshole in her own way, but you\u2019re definitely not winning any awards. You kicked a child out of his home because you didn\u2019t care about his relationship with Dad, and that maybe your girlfriend needed to protect her son from *your* behavior. She\u2019s obviously also protecting you by not telling her son that he needs to be sneaky or that it\u2019s a negative interaction. She might be an asshole, a little bit for lying to you, and for talking about it online, but you sound like an impossible and selfish partner.", "ESH-you for continually referring to 'your apartment' as if Sara and Nathan haven't been living there for 18 months or so; you even say you kicked her out of 'my apartment'-was it not their home too? Because it doesn't sound like you ever let them feel like it was.\n\nSara is somewhat an AH for reneging on your agreement without discussing it with you, I wonder what Mark's visits were like though. Were you welcoming or did you treat him like an intruder/nuisance? Was Nathan able to enjoy his time with his dad with you there?  I suspect the answer is no and that's likely why Sara started letting the visits happen when you weren't around. That doesn't make what she did right, but it makes it understandable.\n\nI actually think Sara's dodged a bullet and hopefully she'll realise that. Living with you doesn't sound like much fun.", "ESH going begind your back sure wasn't the right approach but she has a point too. It is her home and while I in principal understand your way of thinking how long did you plan to keep this up? For every visit ever? Why didn't you think Sarah would keep Mark in check for the visit? I think somehow you lack trust which each other which considering Sarah's behavior might be justified but what kind of relationship is this", "ESH-  Your GF should not have lied to you multiple times or had Mark over without you knowing. \n\nYou are also a liar because you said it was \u201cOur home\u201d but it is not.

On the other hand, kicking them out just seems way above what's warranted by the situation. Maybe it's that I've been raised in a fairly rough neighborhood, but I simply would never ever kick someone out unless they were violent with me.\n\nYou have reasons to lack trust in your partner right now, but did you had reasons to lack trust in Mark? I understand that it's her ex and all that, but I would talk to him; I'm pretty sure he was told that he could be there after all.\n\nNow if he was in with the lies - not necessarily easy to discern - that would be another story. At this point, you may ask whether she actually wanna stay with you or move back with her ex, because that's just weird af. Then from this moment I would consider, depending on the reaction, to ask them to leave.\n\nBut even due to a breakup, I wouldn't kick my partner and her kid out. Kicking out people is dangerous, at least where I come from. You could at the very least have given them both a head up.\n\n***My feeling is that this added up to a bunch of prior lies and that you had enough, and I would say NTA if the kid wasn't there. Kicking out the mom and the kid together and probably having this whole argument in front of them makes you, IMHO, an AH as well. They really did NOT need to feel accountable in that situation.***\n\nYeah... everyone suck here, I'm afraid", "ESH.\nI am concerned about what that poor kid must be thinking. \nHe likely knows that him speaking up about his dad visiting is the reason he and his mom are no longer living with you. \nAlso, if they've been living there a year and a half, she has rights, mostly just time to find a place. I kinda wish she'd have looked into it. \nI understand she lied, and it's fine if you want to end the relationship, but there are better ways to go about it, especially when a child is involved. \nI feel this poor kid is going to need therapy for a while. \nOP just seems super impulsive, and he acted on his anger instead of taking a minute to consider the implications of his actions. \nAll adults here suck.", "She's the AH for hiding something that clearly was very important to you, but YTA for treating it all as you doing them a favour by letting them stay at your apartment. \n\nYou either want them there - and are prepared for a cohabitation, which means discussing things as adults and not a \"this is *my* house and you get out of here\" AH move at the first serious argument - or you don't want them there, in which case don't delude them, especially a kid, about you being a reliable source of safety and shelter.", "Yep!  You totally are!  You had them move in with you and never accept that that was their home too!  What you did was absolutely awful and the fact that she has to hide visits from her ex to visit his son tells you just how big of an asshat that you are!  Get some help", "NTA for having boundaries and getting angry when your boundaries are disrespected. She should have had a conversation with you if she wanted to revisit the outside visitor rule, and given you her reasons and the opportunity to change your mind or refuse. At that point, if you had refused she could have just moved out with her child and found a less restrictive environment to live in. Hiding and lying to get her way was a bad choice from the beginning, no matter how unreasonable she found the restriction.\n\nWhile obviously she does have the right to have feelings about and discuss them with her friends and family, they all need to mind their own business and shouldn\u2019t be contacting you about it, either privately or on social media.\n\nThat being said, YTA for kicking her and her child out without giving you both a cool off period and another attempt at discussion, or at least some time for them to prepare and move out in a calmer way. The manner in which you did it, I\u2019d call it \u201cthe nuclear option\u201d, after 4 years together and 1.5 years in the same home, really shows your level of love and regard for them. Honestly, if your relationship was that quickly and easily discarded, for something that isn\u2019t infidelity or domestic violence, then IMO she is 100% better off.", "ESH - without trust, you have nothing.

I think it would have been better to just ask them to visit outside your home. I don't think you were right to kick your GF out over this, especially since there's a child involved.

If it's entirely the idea of her lying through omission that's causing you to rethink your relationship, no, you're not overreacting.

Daughter let a boyfriend move in and they lived together in the home for ~18 months. He never had a job or paid any rent; daughter got fed up and broke up with him. She moved out but he refused to, but because he had been living there 30+ days, even though he was not on a lease agreement or had ever paid rent, my friend had to go through a formal eviction process. During that period, he caused damage to the home and she had to take him to small claims court as he had never paid any security deposit. \n\nMoral: if you own or lease a living space and let someone move in with you, check the landlord-tenant laws in your area.", "Wasn't a whim, it was building up from the first time she lied and ended when she got caught and tripled down on the manipulation.

I need you to make arrangements to pack your stuff and move out by the end of the week.\"", "If you go through the formal eviction process, they will.

His ex is 100% the AH here, alllllllllllllllllllllllllllll day long. And I laugh at those calling it her house as well.

We see she has no problem raising hell in his life and trying to turn everyone against him. I wouldn't trust her as far as I could throw her.

Theres probably a reason this guy isnt allowed to pick the kid up and take him out places.", "And the fact the bio-dad didn\u2019t have his own place to host the visits strongly suggests irresponsibility, or immaturity, or just not having his life together. More reasons for him to miss his ex who has stability and everything he still wants in life. It\u2019s a recipe for cheating and she also made that possible by hiding the meetings and **lying** over and over and over about the visits. That\u2019s huge.

I spent a lot of time doing nothing but working to get where I am and don't much agree with anyone I allow to live with me thinking they can full rein over everything; more so now days when rent and housing is so much. If the OP is taking care of everything and did long before those two moved in he has a right to be protective of things. I don't think he did anything wrong. \n\nAnd you are right - doesn't need to be anything special in the apartment.

OP didn't hand down an edict and asked her to follow it. They discussed it and came to an agreement. Also based on what was and wasn't said I can't assume that just because she's lived there for a year that it's her home. Maybe OP still considers her and her son as his guests.

Maintaining the same boundary you have always set is not \"abuse\". Abusers want to maintain control over their victims, not sever that control, and OP has separated himself from his ex by his own choice. The extreme melodrama of the use of \"survival instincts\" here is also very manipulative.
