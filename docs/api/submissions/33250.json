What he said was racist, period.  And then he tried to justify it with more racism.  You are absolutely right to call that kind of language what it is.\n\nThe fact that he\u2019s so offended by the mere implication that his racist statements were racist implies that deep down he knows it\u2019s true, and is trying to shift the blame to you somehow, so he doesn\u2019t have to feel guilty.", "NTA- I give him a D- for his attempt at recovery. Attempting at rationalizing his thought thru a \u201cpositive\u201d bias. He\u2019s TAH. He needs to accept the feedback and trying to do better next time.", "NTA, As the daughter of a hardworking mexican women who was a house keeper for 30 years. I would have absolutely cussed tf out of anyone who said that. Ignorance and racism at its finest. If he's that comfortable to say that to YOUR face as a Latina. Imagine what inappropriate jokes the children hear and he makes around friends.", "NTA. You called it for what it was. He wants a good cleaner with a good work ethic (hopefully not one he can underpay). He should face his biases when you point them out, regardless of your ethnicity.", "NTA - his remarks were indeed racist", "nta.  your husband made a racist comment, and you called him out on it.", "\"one of those Mexican ones\" - it's like they're a thing. Yup, that's racist! NTA.", "NTA. I'm spanish, and it does sound offensive, especially since he specifically wanted a Mexican housekeeper, HOWEVER, like it or not, many times there's truth to stereotypes, and if I was ever to hire a housekeeper I too would go for a Spanish housekeeper. Ironic, I know.", "NAH, but your husband isn't off scot free either. As a Mexican person married into a white family, what he said was true. Housekeepers from Mexico usually charge less. Regardless, he could have said that with way more tact. The way he said it sounds racist. You know if he's truly racist or not. You should have a conversation about his language though, especially because his wife children are of Mexican heritage too.\n\nEdit: scot free", "YTA. Don\u2019t call your husband a racist. Educate  him, don\u2019t immiserate him.", "I am a Mexican, and I had a few housekeepers and they were and the future ones will be Mexican. My Grandma was a housekeeper, who charged a fair price.

I\u2019m white\u2026and I found what he said to be incredibly racist.  And he\u2019s now trying to dig himself out of the hole he put himself in but is just managing to dig that hole deeper.  \n\nDude needs to just admit he spoke without much thought and that the little amount of thought he did bring to bear got stuck in racial stereotypes, for which he is profoundly sorry.\n\nPerhaps when it\u2019s his turn to access the single brain that some men pass around, he\u2019ll figure out how to get his foot out of his mouth.", "This is a hard one. Do mexican housekeepers have a noticeably lower rate?  If it is a factual statement then I don't personally see it as racist, but perhaps some context would better clarify the situation.", "Okay, so no you\u2019re NTA. Your husband said some really not so nice things. However, that is NOT RACISM. Let\u2019s get this straight so that as a culture we can understand ourselves and others better and the terms that we prescribe to each other. \n\nRacism involves thinking that one race or people is inherently of lesser quality than other races. That is not what he was saying. \n\nHe is guilty of heavy prejudice. Prejudice involves making distinctions between races. \n\nJust because someone says something that is heavily prejudiced, doesn\u2019t not make it racism since they have to actually have the other race.", "YTA. Not his fault mexican people are a cheap labor where you live.", "YTA. Stereotyping yes he did.  But did he tell you to hire some wetbacks\u2026.  No. \n\nI\u2019m Mexican 2nd generation American.  My house keepers are Mexican, my lawn crew is Mexican.  And you know what, I tell my white af wife to make sure they are Mexican because they are cheaper and normally do better work.", "I think you are oversensitive. \n\nI could not see your husband using any negative comment about the qualities of Mexicans. He pointed out that imigrant to the US are ready to work for lower salaries then others.\n\nIn my view you were wrong in calling your husband a racist. I do not see in his comments about the qualities of Mexicans any sign of racism. The fact that he married you, get a long nicely with your mother and has a son that is one quarter Mexican should add to this.\n\nThat said - he is not totaly clean. The issue at stake is not racism but exploration of immigrants. The fact that he is ready to look to pay people less by utilising their situation is questionable but not racist.\n\nI think you need to talk with him and apologise for calling him racist but be clear you were upset that he implied that you (both of you) should utilise the difficult economic situation of immigrants to get cheap labour.\n\nIf your future housekeeper is a trustworthy person and makes your life easier - she should be payed well. You get what you are paying for.", "Usually I find people on the internet responding, ''DIVORCE THIS MAN'' to random ass posts dumb as hell, but I have to ask... do you wanna be with someone who thinks like this?", "NTA- He probably said it to offend you specifically. In my opinion he is not only racist but trying to bring you down.", "Nta. Saying you\u2019re not racist doesn\u2019t make the racist thing you said go away and magically become better.", "They're not MexiCANTS", "Based on the actual definition of \"racist\", what he said wasn't racist and he isn't a racist. His statement was ignorant for sure, but not racist. \nYall can disagree and downvote me all you want, but you're not gonna change my mind on this. That word gets thrown around so much these days, with most people using it having no idea what it actually means, and I'm tired of it.", "Alittle yta Mexican are known to be hard workers. My gf mom was a cleaning lady at one point and had multiple accounts. She even sold tamales on the street when bills were tough. Now she drives a semi truck. I don't see it as being racist others might.", "These housekeepers aren\u2019t born with house keeping skills. What had this got to do with the colour they\u2019re born with? You\u2019re not born with ethnicity either.", "NTA  \n\n\nAn idiot remark on his part deserved an opposite and condemning remark. Judging by the way he back pedaled so fat, I would think he was more dumb than racist.   \n\n\nDial it back and let him off the hook.", "NTA.  He is racist, your son is NOT white, he is also Mexican if you are his mother.", "Nta\nWhat he said was racist.", "My Uncle only hired Mexicans because they work hard and need jobs.", "YTA. It\u2019s not racist to want to pay the least amount, the fact that the Mexicans tend to be the cheapest is just coincidence.\n\nYes, you\u2019re crazy and blew it out of proportion because all your husband said was that he wants cheap labour that he can trust.", "ESH. Obviously what he said was racist, but as his spouse your role isn\u2019t to attack him. The correct way to handle the situation would be to explain to him without name calling that what he said was offensive to you. \n\nThis isn\u2019t Twitter, it\u2019s your marriage.
