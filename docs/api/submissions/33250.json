I do not see in his comments about the qualities of Mexicans any sign of racism. The fact that he married you, get a long nicely with your mother and has a son that is one quarter Mexican should add to this.\n\nThat said - he is not totaly clean. The issue at stake is not racism but exploration of immigrants. The fact that he is ready to look to pay people less by utilising their situation is questionable but not racist.\n\nI think you need to talk with him and apologise for calling him racist but be clear you were upset that he implied that you (both of you) should utilise the difficult economic situation of immigrants to get cheap labour.\n\nIf your future housekeeper is a trustworthy person and makes your life easier - she should be payed well.

Obviously what he said was racist, but as his spouse your role isn\u2019t to attack him.

In general, our results support a contrary north-to-south gradient throughout the Mexican territory of European and Native-American ancestries, respectively. Moreover, the presence of West-European R1b and Sub-Saharan African E1b1a haplogroups agrees with historical and genetic data of gene flow during the European conquest. This study represents the effort to analyze these paternal lineages on a large scale by taking advantage of Y-STR haplotype data to determine the distribution and ancestry proportions in this country.

Racist people will be offended cus they were called out on their bullshit, someone who wasn't even being racist being called racist will be offended because they are being accused of something awful when they didn't even commit what they are accused of.

His English was only ever minimal.\n\nThis kind of thing affects the next generation. They are poor, they might also skip school to get a job. If they don't speak fluent English, it limits their opportunities to more physical and demanding jobs. They do not set their wages; the company maybe hires them at a low wage and may not have any incentive to increase that much (lack of education and fluent English as a reason). It's a vicious cycle.

If you love this man and want to try to take the time to gently lead him to a conclusion, focus less on what he *meant* and whether or not *he* is racist, and more on *what he sounded like* and how *the ways he has learned to speak about Mexicans in the US service sector* is institutionally racist, and so he himself doesn't have to believe in some comical version of white supremacy to nonetheless still repeat things that perpetuate systemic inequalities.\n\nIt's not a level of effort I'd put in for just any old racist, certainly, but if it were the man I love and I want to keep working on this relationship, that is how I would tackle him - focusing on education and maybe even giving him some of the background on why we have the stereotypes about Mexican laborers being so cheap.\n\nThis can look like very gently nudging his beliefs and hoping he eventually see how wrong they are, in a way that - critically - doesn't try to get him to think he's wrong but simply *mistaken*, and thereby keep him from getting defensive.

In a English speaking country if you don't have basic literacy then you will pay for it either with less pay and/or more physical work. That is fair and expected.\n\nThe alternative? Don't hire them?
