Because unless you're ready to be entirely self-supporting, you may have to do whatever you need to, to have a roof over your head.

I think your stepdad is the most insecure dude ever and i hope he treats your mom good. But thats a choice she has to make. Since you wont be living with them all of your life, i would say sorry to him. Not because he isnt a jerk. But because you're not.

Stick to your guns, only apologize if he does. \n\nNTA", "Absolutely NTA. And don't apologize...you have nothing to apologize for bc you're right. He doesn't get to insult you over and over and get mad when you tell him the truth about himself.  What's that saying? Let me tell you a little something about you that you don't know?

And you are great.", "NTA \n\nSo basically what I getting is that he spent his time projecting his insecurities about not having  a proper education onto you and all you did was remind him that he has no ground to stand on when it comes to criticizing your education.", "The couple people I know with art majors make a few hundred k a year.\nAlso, not being educated is no reason to be a baby like your step-dad.
