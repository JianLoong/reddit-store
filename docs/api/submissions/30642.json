Like, you can have an adult conversation first before calling the landlord.", "Do you really think that's going to work with someone that thought it perfectly ok to open someone else's tv and badly mount it themselves and then try to pass it off as the ops problem that they f'd up?\n\nIf the op went to the landlord immediately about the move in, sure, you'd have a point, but the room mates behavior clearly demonstrates the effort would be wasted.  Not notifying the landlord now means potential risk to the op being held responsible for the actions of his idiot roommate and his brother.", "And they are entitled to that why?\n\nThe proper and safest thing for op to do is go through the landlord because those are the processes in place to handle these situations and it's not ops responsibility to protect them from their mistakes.  They're grown men whining that someone held them responsiblefor what they did, not children who stole a candy bar.  Grow up.\n\nIt sounds like you're just pandering to bad behavior.", "I don't know if it would've worked! But it's not like having the conversation means he can't then go to the landlord.", "It was never said they are entitled to that, it was just said they should do that . It would be the nice, non-asshole thing to do. We aren't talking about stealing a candy bar, we are talking about housing family that would otherwise be homeless. Grow up and learn some compassion. Sounds like you have little concern for the well being of others.", "But he HAS to go to the landlord.  Say they talk it over and the friend repairs it but screws that up too. Now they go to move out and landlord goes after both of them for the damage.  Or worse yet sees it at some point and moves to evict them both for breach of contract.  The only way the op can be safe from his roommate's stupidity here is going to the landlord.  Otherwise he's risking his own finances and housing.", "Yet you continue to explain why they deserved the benefit of doubt. You can't even make a point without contradicting yourself.  Do you even think before you speak?\n\nCompassion has nothing to do with holding people accountable. Again, you ate not entitled to peoples compassion, you can't not force people to show you compassion when you fuck them over.  Sorry you don't feel responsible for the things you fuck up in life, but no you don't get a free pass.\n\nHes being evicted, he's an adult and he kind figure out his own housing issues. Op is not responsible for housing another grown ass man.  Maybe their mommy can do it, she's family anyway.  Do better.\n\nIt sounds like you just want freebies in life, sorry bud but when you're an adult you'll understand the world doesn't pander to you.  You are insanely entitled.  It's laughable you think you're entitled to anyone's compassion after fucking them over.", "All I'm saying is that he could have talked to the guys before going to the landlord. He could have said, \"Look, I need you to tell the landlord you did this and do whatever is needed to fix it.\" Most people here seem to think these two guys weren't owed that, so fine. That's their prerogative. And I admit, they screwed up. But given how difficult things are out there and how hard it is to find a home, I would've at least offered them the chance to fix the situation.", "> Compassion has nothing to do with holding people accountable\n\nSure it does, it's a reason not to hold them accountable for moving in someone not in the lease.\n\n>Again, you ate not entitled to peoples compassion, you can't not force people to show you compassion when you fuck them over.\n\nTrue, I never disagreed with this, but you are also not entitled to be considered a non-asshole just because you follow the rules and exercise all rights you are entitled to.\n\nMaybe when you grow up and become and adult you'll realize the world is full of assholes and not all rules should be followed. But you seem to be confusing entitlement to something, and hoping for something because it's the nice thing to do. I don't think the brother is entitled to stay, it would just be the nice, non-asshole thing to allow him to stay.", "I love how you think reporting property damage and a broken lease are asshole moves.

Brownie points for trying. Enjoy your life,  try not to fuck people over anymore.\n\nEdit: uh oh got blocked looks like I struck a nerve, guess my guess wasn't too far off lmao.
