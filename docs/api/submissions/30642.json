Because it\u2019s his brother and it doesn\u2019t matter. Dan is staying in his brother room on a blow up bed. \n\nLast week I bought a new tv for the apartment. Per our lease all tv\u2019s have to have a professional hang them to minimize damages to the wall. That was being done on Monday. \n\nI bought the tv on Friday night so it was just sitting in a box waiting for the person to arrive Monday. \n\nFor some reason while I was out on Saturday Dan and Dave decided they wanted to watch the tv and decided to hang it themselves.  The tv promptly fell off the wall broke the tv and left a hole in the wall. \n\nThey panicked and sent me a picture asking me to come home and help them. I said no and forwarded the pic to our apartment manager because I\u2019m over the situation and left a long rant about unemployed Dan living there causing damages. \n\nThe landlord was pissed and talked to them Monday and now Dan and Dave has to go for breaking their lease agreement. They can go willingly or through an eviction process but now they are mad at me because it\u2019s putting them out right after the holidays. \n\nI\u2019m allowed to move in another roommate after that (pending landlord approval) but Dave and Dan are angry that I showed my landlord what they did and they are refusing to replace the tv because I made them homeless. Dave already lost his deposit because he\u2019s gotta pay for the damages to the wall.  So he can\u2019t rely on getting his part of the deposit back to fund a new place. \n\nThe brothers think I should have handled the situation privately and not involved the landlord but I was sick of them both for sending me the picture and acting like it was my problem that they f uped the tv and the wall.", "created_utc": 1699540717, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17reddo/aita_for_for_forcing_my_roommates_to_pay_for/", "score": 132, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Will make it slam dunk.", "Get the small vlaims. Send to collections and fuck up their finances for a decade.", "My question as well, did Dave even know you disliked Dan being there so much", "I think moving in his unemployed brother to begin with was the first major issues. Maybe I\u2019m a monster tho.", "Ok so numnuts senior moves numnuts junior in AGAINST the terms of the lease, risking OP's tenancy. \n\nThen violates the terms of lease a SECOND time hanging a TV AGAIN RISKING OP's Tenancy\n\nThen he wants OP to help fix the damage, so waste even more of OP's money because whatever he spent on the TV is down the drain. \n\nAlso lets be honest here if the landlord has it in the lease that a professional has to hang a TV, its going to be in the lease that whacking great holes in the wall have to be fixed by professionals as well.", "What else should OP have done?", "OP doesn\u2019t live with roommates. OP lives with one roommate and one tv-breaking, wall-damaging freeloader.", "OP says in the first line that he and the landlord weren\u2019t consulted or told about Dave moving his brother in.\n\n\u201c My roommate Dave let his brother Dan move in without consulting me or the landlord.\u201d\n\nAs for hanging the TV both Dave and Dan did it and Dave signed the lease agreement so he knows the rules about having a professional hang it. And who even opens someone else\u2019s brand new TV and tries to hang it without even notifying the person who purchased it?? They only told OP after they broke it and damaged the wall. \n\nOP you can take them to small claims court to recoup the cost of the TV they broke if they won\u2019t pay up.\n\nNTA", "Do you know how much rent is in large cities these days with someone coming in for free and not helping out? Of course we had that argument but Dan stayed and took advantage.", "Thanks for confirming. ESH.", "Asked roommate to pay for it", "Yes I\u2019ve lived in one of the top 3 most expensive cities. I\u2019m saying this because it sounds like you may be one of those roommates who doesn\u2019t have conflict resolution and immediately takes things to the landlord, which is within your rights legally, but an asshole move.", "I note you haven't answered my INFO question.", "> Do you know how much rent is in large cities these days with someone coming in for free and not helping out? \n\nThe same cost as not having someone extra come in. So it sounds like Dan didn't affect anything. Kinda makes you come off as an asshole. If my brother or my mom was in such a desperate situation they were about to be homeless, I'd take them in to my place. I'd hope any roommates would have some basic human sympathy for someone in such a dire situation.", "Damn I guess you're an AH for holding people accountable nowadays.  \n\nDon't listen to them op, this is what you call an enabler.", "Well Yea, holding people accountable can be an AH move, depending on the rule violation and why. I think someone housing immediate family whom would otherwise be homeless is something to let slide.", "It's almost like there are different ways of holding people accountable. Like, you can have an adult conversation first before calling the landlord.", "Do you really think that's going to work with someone that thought it perfectly ok to open someone else's tv and badly mount it themselves and then try to pass it off as the ops problem that they f'd up?\n\nIf the op went to the landlord immediately about the move in, sure, you'd have a point, but the room mates behavior clearly demonstrates the effort would be wasted.  Not notifying the landlord now means potential risk to the op being held responsible for the actions of his idiot roommate and his brother.", "And they are entitled to that why?\n\nThe proper and safest thing for op to do is go through the landlord because those are the processes in place to handle these situations and it's not ops responsibility to protect them from their mistakes.  They're grown men whining that someone held them responsiblefor what they did, not children who stole a candy bar.  Grow up.\n\nIt sounds like you're just pandering to bad behavior.", "I don't know if it would've worked! But it's not like having the conversation means he can't then go to the landlord.", "It was never said they are entitled to that, it was just said they should do that . It would be the nice, non-asshole thing to do. We aren't talking about stealing a candy bar, we are talking about housing family that would otherwise be homeless. Grow up and learn some compassion. Sounds like you have little concern for the well being of others.", "But he HAS to go to the landlord.  Say they talk it over and the friend repairs it but screws that up too. Now they go to move out and landlord goes after both of them for the damage.  Or worse yet sees it at some point and moves to evict them both for breach of contract.  The only way the op can be safe from his roommate's stupidity here is going to the landlord.  Otherwise he's risking his own finances and housing.", "Yet you continue to explain why they deserved the benefit of doubt. You can't even make a point without contradicting yourself.  Do you even think before you speak?\n\nCompassion has nothing to do with holding people accountable. Again, you ate not entitled to peoples compassion, you can't not force people to show you compassion when you fuck them over.  Sorry you don't feel responsible for the things you fuck up in life, but no you don't get a free pass.\n\nHes being evicted, he's an adult and he kind figure out his own housing issues. Op is not responsible for housing another grown ass man.  Maybe their mommy can do it, she's family anyway.  Do better.\n\nIt sounds like you just want freebies in life, sorry bud but when you're an adult you'll understand the world doesn't pander to you.  You are insanely entitled.  It's laughable you think you're entitled to anyone's compassion after fucking them over.", "All I'm saying is that he could have talked to the guys before going to the landlord. He could have said, \"Look, I need you to tell the landlord you did this and do whatever is needed to fix it.\" Most people here seem to think these two guys weren't owed that, so fine. That's their prerogative. And I admit, they screwed up. But given how difficult things are out there and how hard it is to find a home, I would've at least offered them the chance to fix the situation.", "> Compassion has nothing to do with holding people accountable\n\nSure it does, it's a reason not to hold them accountable for moving in someone not in the lease.\n\n>Again, you ate not entitled to peoples compassion, you can't not force people to show you compassion when you fuck them over.\n\nTrue, I never disagreed with this, but you are also not entitled to be considered a non-asshole just because you follow the rules and exercise all rights you are entitled to.\n\nMaybe when you grow up and become and adult you'll realize the world is full of assholes and not all rules should be followed. But you seem to be confusing entitlement to something, and hoping for something because it's the nice thing to do. I don't think the brother is entitled to stay, it would just be the nice, non-asshole thing to allow him to stay.", "I love how you think reporting property damage and a broken lease are asshole moves.  Youre just plain wrong bud, im picking up the vibes you've probably got experience with this.  Guess you didn't learn your lesson and still want others to cover your ass when you don't respect them.\n\nBut really the gull to be so confident yet so wrong is impressive.  Brownie points for trying. Enjoy your life,  try not to fuck people over anymore."]}
