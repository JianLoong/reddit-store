Just tell her you consider her a good friend but you\u2019ve been burned in the past and you learned your lesson.", "NTA it's your place I wouldn't want other people in my bed either", "*NTA*\n\nShe says she would give anything to get away from her soon to be ex-husband? How about give a new landlord some paperwork and a reasonable monthly fee called rent, so that she can have her own space, where she can bring her lovely dog and any guy in the world she wishes to hook up with, without encroaching on the personal space of someone that has not offered it.\nIf a full on lease is too complicated for now, there's a nifty little app called airbnb that sets you up with all sorts of monthly rentals.", "NTA- don\u2019t do it.", "NTA she wants to bang guys at your place because it will be easy for her to do instead of lying to her husband every time.", "NTA don\u2019t do it it\u2019ll be a mess, she\u2019ll get too comfortable/entitled etc there\u2019s so many reasons why this isn\u2019t a good idea I don\u2019t really no where to start but for starters it gives her an in to overstep your boundaries and her situation is not anything remotely close to what you went through so don\u2019t take it like she needs help/saving like you did she\u2019s fine she just wants a place to hookup with guys where she won\u2019t be bothered her ex isn\u2019t going to hurt her, abuse her etc she just doesn\u2019t want to be there that\u2019s not a good enough reason to allow someone in your home unsupervised\n\nETA it really sounds like your projecting your past and trauma onto your friend and it\u2019s making you feel like you should do something there\u2019s ZERO need for even if she\u2019s not the one manipulating you to feel that way and it\u2019s all in your head and your making yourself feel responsible her asking is still very much entitled and inappropriate even if you can\u2019t see it just don\u2019t go down this road from experience (both with being a DV survivor and having friends that used me in situations like this) DONT", "NTA\u2026.your friend does not want to get away from her husband, she was a love  pad while you are away.  Her situation is entirely different from yours.  Don\u2019t give her a key.", "Absolutely not. Do not let her have access to anything. Tell her that your lease does not allow someone to stay at your apartment who is not on the lease for more than three days.   would love to let her stay but you can\u2019t break your lease. That\u2019s how you get out of this situation.", "NTA. You are not her solution. While you may have all the sympathy in the world, she can\u2019t look to you to solve her problem. You can lend her a sympathetic ear but not your flat. If you were to agree, your quality of life is affected and once she\u2019s been there for a set amount of time, you may not be able to legally get rid of her without an eviction process. If you are renting or leasing, it may be a breach of your agreement to have another person there for so long.", "NTA\n\nIMO as she stated she would pay anything to get away for a while she should go get a room at an extended stay hotel. \n\nShe may be clean at her house and reliable at work but being a fossil I have experienced first hand that people can be very different staying somewhere they don\u2019t own when there is no one there to hold them accountable so to speak. \n\nYou might check your lease as there may be something in it about guest staying in general let alone guests staying when you aren\u2019t there.  Landlords aren\u2019t crazy about things like that as there is increased risk. And the person who they will come after is you. \n\nSo again just me but the answer I would give is no.", ">Anna decided to divorce her husband. He\u2019s a nice guy (that\u2019s what she\u2019s saying), but she says they are too different. She started sleeping around (he doesn\u2019t know) before handing him the divorce papers, but as far as she is saying, they stopped talking weeks ago.\n\nSo, in her own words, this isn't an abuse situation. She isn't in any real danger. In fact it's a better description to say **he's** in danger, because he doesn't know if he's caught second hand chlamydia. Yet, in spite of this she wants to move into your place, because she can't stand being in this awkward situation of her own making?\n\nYeah, no, NTA, YWNBTA, whatever. This isn't someone at risk, this is someone reaping what they've sown.", "If my ex could get a hotel room for one night during the major C19 lockdowns in Germany where it was restricted to business only with official proof to cheat on me, I think OP's \"friends\" can find somewhere else to fuck.", "It's probably not relevant since she already filled for divorce. They're considered separated at that point.", "If she has the money to stay elsewhere she should do just find a new flat", "That doesn\u2019t mean anything if she finds it convenient to stay with you you\u2019ll still have a couch surfer for 3 months if not more if she\u2019s lying about the place if cancels it because she\u2019s comfortable where she is with you and if she\u2019s entitled to ask for your house key in a situation where it\u2019s NOT needed she\u2019ll feel entitled to a hell of a lot more of you just don\u2019t", "Gotcha. Still definitely not the asshole because I wouldn't want my place to be a fuck palace for a coworker haha", "Wasn't expecting that at all. Loving coming to this sub for unexpected laughs like this.", "Ear spiders. If you\u2019re looking for one too.", "You talked about how you would shelter your friend if she was under threat. But what if she is lying? Does this one question absolve you of your moral duty?\n\nThat's basically what you are doing by saying \"what if it's an open relationship?\" Any relationship can be open but that doesn't mean we assume every relationship is open. Rather we assume every relationship is closed because that's how most relationships are. Don't generalise exceptions. There is a possibility that her cheating is justified in some sense but that would be an exception\n\nDon't try to justify bad actions just because they are done by people you like.", "You\u2019re welcome :)", "NTA- but if she moves in she's not leaving no time soon.", "NTA, You'd be one to yourself if you gave her your keys. You don't owe anyone space in your home, esp when you're not there. I never let anyone access my home when I'm away simply because too many people have proven they can't be trusted when they are unsupervised.\n\nYou DO NOT owe her anything and really don't have tht room to host her. Do not invite her drama and problems into your home. You're better off helping her look for her one place and suggesting places she call for a home. You don't owe her yours.", "NTA.  \nAnna wants a bang-pad that can't be traced back to her. Her husband isn't abusive, so there's no real reason for her to want to get away from him.", "NTA - a \"reliable\" person doesn't start sleeping around behind her husband's back before divorce papers.\n\nShe's likely doing most of the abusing if anyone, and she's trying to take advantage of knowing the situation that you were in thinking that you'll empathize. Do not buy into this.", "NTA\n\nThis isn't an emergency situation. She has an okay home right now. Unless you are extremely close to that friend and willing to put up with any potential drama that ensues, it's definitely the wisest thing to deny her.\n\nParticularly when you are in another country.

You will come back home to find your locks changed and Almost everything else in your home, and that's on a likely chance you even manage to get inside your home. Please Don't Do it.

If you EVER Choose to allow a GUEST To Stay in your Home, Please Make Sure you Firstly Know them Well. AND You Must be Staying their at all times to allow this.

Don't give her a key.", "NTA, do you want her sleeping with people at your place? These strangers could take stuff.", "NTA. Not your problem.", "NTA. She wants a free place to stay, likely somewhere that her husband can't tell she's cheating but where if she brings people to have sex they'll think it's her own house\n\nIf she just wanted to get away, a hotel is the answer. But obviously that isn't free and makes her look like a prostitute. I'd suggest ditching her as a friend, you know she's dishonest and disloyal. You'll be the victim of that eventually.", "NTA\n\nShes not entitled to your place. It really seems like she just wants a place to get away from her husband so she can have other hook ups over.

She can search and rent something.", "She might but she also can cancel so it's  not a certainty she'll  have  something  after moving in.

I wouldn't bring up her new found hobby of screwing lots of guys as the reason you won't hand over keys!\n\nIf she pushes it, just say that you're used to living alone and have stuff out all over the place, and it wouldn't be safe for her dog, you don't want to have to rearrange your whole apartment to make it dog friendly, and she'd have to deep scrub the whole place 3 times, not to mention dry clean all your clothes, before she left...\n\nmake it about you being sloppy and not wanting the dog all up in that!", "I have literal thousands of screenshots because of this.
