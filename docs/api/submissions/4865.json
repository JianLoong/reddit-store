Other than the fact that she would like to have your place as a \"crash pad\" for free, there is no reason to let her have full run of your place. Since you say she is sleeping around, it is 100% certain she would be bringing guys over there.", "NTA, You do not owe her this.", "NTA\n\nyou and Anna\u2019s situations were very different. She is not in an unsafe situation, you were.\n\nYou sound like a very kind and compassionate person, but it is ok to not be comfortable with this.", "NTA. \n\nYou won't be able to know when she is coming or going or what she is doing in your home, and just in general don't feel comfortable, and that is fine. \n\nShe is going through a divorce and millions of people go through them without any major drama. Understandably, due to your past, you are thinking through what does she need to be protected, but from what you say, there is nothing for her to be worried about in terms of safety. \n\nShe has a job so has some financial resources, she clearly is able to communicate freely on her phone and come and go as she pleases if she is able to meet up with men/date/sleep around, so if she wants to get away from him, she can. What she wants is to take advantage of an empty space, and that isn't your problem. \n\nI see a lot of the comments about safety for you with  her ex maybe now knowing where you live, these other men knowing, etc. and certainly you should think about that. But even if I had a single friend who just wanted a key while I was away- no drama- I would still likely say no. I don't want my home to be a crash pad and you don't know if she will take care of your property and keep it secure. Remind yourself this isn't a safety issue for her, she is not in the position you were in, and your home is currently your safe place and you don't need to go through worrying about it while you are away because she doesn't want to spend $100 on a hotel to hookup with a dude. \n\nSo just say no. Actually don't say anything and try to avoid this conversation- if you see it headed that way try to dip out of the conversation- and if she asks again, just say \"oh no, I'm not comfortable giving anyone access to my place when I am away\" and leave it at that. You don't need to ask if she is safe or okay, you don't need to make more excuses, just a simple, breezy \"no, that won't work\" is sufficient.", "NTA\n\nThis is not even up for discussion.\n\nDO NOT GIVE HER A KEY.\n\nDo you have friends who can do 'housesitting' for you to make certain she doesn't try to break in and squat in your apt while you are gone?   And have sex with her pickup du jour?   Because it sounds to me like that is what she has planned", "YTA. Only because you're supporting a friend who was obviously sleeping around behind her husbands back. Even when she says he's is acting well but hurt, you automatically think he is going to get abusive with her.", "NTA, and she's being crass and demanding.  I kinda wonder whether she would tell her hookups that it's her apartment.\n\nOn that note, look up tenancy law in your area, in case somebody with an *actual need* ever asks you for help.  Just in case.", "NTA. I'd suggest not letting Anna know that you would have no issue giving people keys if they were trying to get out of an abusive relationship because I suspect the story would change from \"he's a nice guy but we're too different to stay married\" to \"oh poor me, he's so abusive and I won't survive this\" almost immediately.", "Nope.

Tell her no and enforce that boundary", "IMO, I don't think you are actually worried about WIBTA. You are  second guessing yourself because you lied to friends and family when they asked if you were OK, so you think Anna may be lying about this too.\n\nBut would you have put your abuser on notice that you were moving out at a future date and then stayed in the home you shared? I bet the answer is H\\_\\_L NO!\n\nSo put your mind at ease, you are NOT putting your coworker at risk of anything except having to live with consequences of cheating on her husband and not having a convenient place to have extramarital sex.\n\nHow many people at work know she's getting divorced because she's cheating on her husband? Do you want it to get around that you gave her access to your home so that she could continue to cheat? You would either come out looking like an enabler or a really naive person of whom it is easy to take advantage. Do you want either of those things to happen?\n\nJust ignore her hints and say no if she asks.

It is just to risky when you worked so hard to get that apartment. \n\nAlso she is in the wrong for cheating, even if the marriage is over.  If she is lying to him, you don't know what lies she is telling you.   She isn't that good of a friend by putting you in the middle of her own divorce. \n\n  She can have the men she is entertaining pay for the hotel rooms or AirBnb.

She would be too afraid and would shut herself off not doing what she\u2019s doing. Put your mind at rest.

Our own experiences tend to affect how we see things, and sometimes we have to step back and look at something like a stranger would to make sure that we are actually seeing them and their situation for what it is and not through the fog of what we experienced. \nHer experience is not yours. She is not leaving because of abuse. Look at the actual timeline and note all the places it is different from yours. She gave him the papers and stayed in the home- she was not afraid to give him the papers, nor to stay there. He is upset because he got blindsided by a cheating spouse- thats normal.

Sorry, but I suspect she knows you have a kind heart and she's taking advantage of that to use your place as a pleasant f\\*ckpad for taking guys back to that's cheaper than hotel rooms - sorry for the crudeness and I hope I'm wrong.\n\nWhat about just telling her that your tenancy lease/HOA doesn't allow subletting/pets and sending details of any suitable (dog-friendly) apartments in the area that you can find online?", "I'm going to add another voice to the \"abused people almost definitely aren't having affairs\" choir here.
