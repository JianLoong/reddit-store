She doesn't sound happy for you at all. I am sorry for her divorce. That does not give her the right to crap on other people's love and joy. Tell her that she can't come and that her negative feelings are the reason why and you do not want that on you and your boyfriends happy day. Congratulations to you both, and have only people at your wedding that will lift your love, not try to smash it to bits.", "ESH\n\nTalk to her. Not including her will ruin the relationship between you two. Or at the very least seriously strain it.\n\nShe is understandably hurt but still as a grown woman she could be more careful in what she says to the bride to be.\n\nTell her how hurtful her current behaviour is for you.\n\nLet her be a part of your big day if she's up to it but be crystal clear she needs to suck it up for one day as this is about you, not her. And give her an open  honest out with no strings attached if it is too much for her.", "Info - have you asked her to stop telling you these things?", "NTA. Tell her you understand why her husband doesn't want her around anymore, and the problem will fix itself.", "NAH. \n\nYour sister is entitled to her feelings post breakup. What she is NOT entitled to do is let her inside feelings run around on the outside during your wedding. So, it's time to be an adult and have an adult conversation with your sister. Tell her you want her at your wedding and it woudln't be the same without her, but if she feels she can't refrain from being miserable or making negative comments during the wedding/reception, she should just stay home, because this day is important to you.", "YWBTA I suggest you speak to her instead. You said she is struggling with it. She needs help with coping, pull out the sister sympathy card.", "YWBTA - she\u2019s going through a rough time and projecting, but don\u2019t ban her from your wedding. She\u2019s your sister, and presumably you\u2019ve had a good relationship up until now. Saying a few crazy things when you\u2019re going through an emotional and chaotic period in your life shouldn\u2019t be enough to get her banned. \n\nThe only thing I would watch is her alcohol intake. You don\u2019t want her over drinking in sorrow and getting weepy or loud. Can you assign a cousin or a friend to hang out with her at the event and help monitor that?", "YWBTA\n\n\nNot inviting her to your wedding is drastic and uncalled for.  Instead use your words like an adult and tell her to stop reflecting her anger about her shit on your relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If being hit with the truth is too much for you, maybe you need to think about if you're really ready to get married. If you were feeling solid in your relationship, you wouldn't be acting this insecure.", "ESH, I can understand the frustration given that your wedding is around the corner and hers just ended. I would sit her down with maybe a parent as a mediator or on the phone. Simply so it\u2019s not (he said she said) and let her understand that you get her pain. You understand she\u2019s going through a hard time. But that if love isn\u2019t meant to be for yourself it will come when it\u2019s time. I would say let her know that she\u2019s welcome to attend,but if she\u2019s too uncomfortable to attend you understand. But make it clear that if she makes a scene or becomes unruly that she will be asked to leave. That way she understands and has time to process and decided what her next step is.", "Ywbta", "I don't think anyone who's getting married in a few weeks deserves to have divorce statistics shoved in their face by a bitter family member,  and I don't think that means that OP is being insecure. Would you tell a newly, happily pregnant mom to be the statistics on miscarriage and birth defects? If older sis can't put her unhappiness out of sight for the day, she has no business attending.", "Trash comment. Mad you\u2019re single?", "Acting insecure? Excuse her for not wanting negativity all around her a few weeks before her wedding. The sister is projecting her own marriage experience to talk shit about the whole institution of it. She is 100% the AH for that. That being said, if OP bans her from the wedding without talking to her, it\u2019ll make her an AH too."]}
