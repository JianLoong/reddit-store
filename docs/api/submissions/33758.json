Before just banning her, reach out to her and make the point to her that you get it she is going through a lot, but she has no right to take it out on you and you had enough.

I\u2019m getting married the day before you so I can relate. I\u2019ve had people say negative things about love and weddings lately.

As soon as she started with her shit i would of pulled her aside and said hey if you continue with your unwanted , unsolicited advice , you wonty be attending.", "Nta. I don't understand the e s h votes. Considering removing someone from your wedding because they're being cynical does not make you an a hole. And even though she's going through a hard time, she's an a hole for trying to make you feel like getting married is pointless. It's the same as someone taking their feelings out on you and that makes people an a hole. Talking to her is the right way to go but this is a no win situation for you.

If she can't, then disinviting her seems like a good idea.", "NTA  Well, you really need to have a sit-down with your sister and let her know how hurtful her discussion about love and your upcoming marriage have been and if she can't stop, she really shouldn't come to your wedding.  Yes, it sucks that her marriage fell apart, but being a 'Debbie Downer' on what is supposed to be one of your happiest moments in life is really not right.", "Talk to her and make it clear that you will not tolerate her saying things like this on your wedding day and if she does she will have to leave.

It sucks and all, but it is understandable.\n\nJust make it clear that she should behave at your wedding. Put on a smile and at least pretend that she is totally happy for you. Ask your parents, other siblings, uncles, aunts, someone you trust to keep an eye on her and get her away from the celebration should she start to rant about love being a lie.\n\nBanning her from the wedding is a step too far in my opinion as there are milder ways to ensure she is not a problem then.", "YTA.

Imagine if your fianc\u00e9 broke up with you after 10 years together; you\u2019d probably feel very similarly to how your sister does.

Let me be very clear: this isn't a request. It's a requirement. If you're going to mope and complain about horrible marriage and love is a lie, you are not allowed to come.\"", "YWBTA. 1) I don\u2019t think you can ban someone from a wedding. Typically someone is just uninvited. 2) Your sister is going through a hard time right now, and her very recent heartbreak is clouding her ability to be happy for you. Divorce is hard and your sister is jaded. \n\nInvite your sister to the wedding. Don\u2019t give her any responsibility or roles in the planning and preparation. Avoid talking to her about your engagements and wedding all together, if possible. Prepare who will give speeches beforehand, so your sister won\u2019t have an opportunity for an impromptu speech. She can just show up and gripe behind your back or get really drunk and hook up with a groomsman. Either way, you can still enjoy your wedding with your heartbroken sister there.", "NTA\n\nIf you usually had a living relationship with your sister, you need to talk to her before taking the nuclear option. \n\n\u201cSis, I know you\u2019re hurting and angry. But this is my wedding and I am happy. I\u2019d love to have you there, but I need to know you\u2019re going to keep negative comments to yourself. If you don\u2019t think you can do so because you\u2019re hurting too much, then please stay home.\u201d", "Your wedding, your choice!", "NTA if you give her a chance to do better.  \n  \nTell her to find someone else to process her feelings of being betrayed by love, that you are feeling the opposite and want to stay in your own bliss, at least for a while.  You are the last person she should be dumping on now and she knows it.  Tell her she has a week to get her head on right or she can't bring her cloud of doom and gloom to your wedding.", "Hovering between NTA and ESH here. Your sister needs to get into therapy for how she's feeling. At the same time, I can understand why you don't want her at your wedding with how she's acting right now. I'd honestly approach her and ask her 'Would you feel better not coming to my wedding with how you're feeling right now? If that's the case and even if it's not, Fiance and I won't take it the wrong way if you decide you don't want to come to our wedding (and associated reception) so soon after your own divorce.' Basically, give her an acceptable out so that she knows you won't be hurt by her not coming and back her up if other family members decide to make a stink about it.", "INFO: Is this typical? Has she always been the \"I'm in a good mood - don't bring me down!\" and \"I'm in a bad mood - stop rubbing your happiness in my face!\" person? If so, then yes. Ban her. Set a boundary. That is very selfish behavior.\n\nIf this is not typical, then I support all the people saying try to communicate, not in a heated moment, that you love her, understand she's hurting, yet she is also doing her best to spread that hurt around and make others suffer because she is. That's not kind and if she cannot stop herself from s***ing on everyone else for continuing to have lives ... she is not coming to the wedding because she is not able to celebrate your life. And that's what that wedding is.", "Upvoted incase you get murdered cause of your rationality", "If you haven't already had a conversation with her and are going straight for a ban, YTA\n\n\"Sis, I realize you are going through a difficult time with your divorce, and Im sorry you had to experience all that pain.\n\nBut lately, you are so down on love that you aren't leaving any space for me to feel happy about my upcoming marriage when Im around you.  \n\nLet me know if it's too much for you to be involved in planning, etc.  I dont want to be a trigger for any painful memories.  But please, as my sister, can you stop making negative comments about love and marriage around me all the time?\"", "NAH. You should to have a sit down and open exchange. She needs to remember that there is love after love and you could profit to learn from her experience.\n\nOn a related topic: please consider a prenup ...love is blind but pettiness is a laser guided bomb", "Yep\u2026 yep ya would. Try to step out of the stage your in right now, and just imagine for a second what divorce might actually feel like. To respect and work for your marriage and have it fail, especially if it\u2019s out of your control. However bad you feel for her, you\u2019re empathy is not matching the level of her suffering at the moment. \n\nSet a boundary, \u201cbeing involved in my wedding activities requires not shitting on love and marriage during those activities and I\u2019ll still love you if you choose to sit it out.\u201d And outside of your wedding activities and wedding, let her wallow a bit and feel bad for herself. Divorce is a big deal, and If it wasn\u2019t we wouldn\u2019t consider banning our sisters from our wedding over their flavor of depression.", "NAH, but Y WBTAH if you banned her without talking to her.\nShe\u2019s going through a tough time, so try to talk to her about this behavior and to try and keep the negativity to herself on your special day. If she doesn\u2019t, then ban her. Neither you or your bf/fiance deserves this kind of stress on your special day.", "YTA.  Don't go looking for trouble which might not exist and then going nuclear with your solution. Your sister probably thinks you are close enough that she can safely vent to you.  She obviously isn't aware that you lack empathy (despite your claim that you feel for her) and are only thinking of yourself.   Just because she is venting now doesn't mean she doesn't know how to behave properly at a wedding.  If you think there is a REAL possibility that she'll say or do something embarrassing, enlist a family member to keep an eye on her."]}
