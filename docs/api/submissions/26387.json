I also learned not to put people on pedestals. Once I worked my way into finding true self-confidence, I soon realized that for as much as I complained about women being attracted to shitty men, I failed to understand that those were women I didn\u2019t actually want anything to do with.\n\nThat said, I also had plenty of encounters where people\u2019s actions don\u2019t match their words and I met numerous women that responded negatively to positive behaviors and positively for harmful behaviors.

My recommendation to a lot of young men is train in a variety of ways to see what fits you best, listen to more types of music and watch many genres of film. Try different styles of clothing until you find the style thst fits. work in a few jobs to learn what you can at least bear to do day in day out and be proud of doing, relax more, try not to look for romance, Build your own personality and life.

I\u2019ve dated fit \u201cnice\u201d guy and i instantly lost attraction to him the moment he starting whining or blaming women on his single status because \u201cwomen are picky\u201d. We don\u2019t fall for the things you are saying, that is a narrative men (the ones whining) have invented to justify their bad attitude.", "No, no, no!  \nGood manners are \"invented\" to make life easier, not harder. Well-mannered person never puts the other people in an awkward situation.  \nGuys' behaviour you describe isn't \"good mannered\", is ill-considered, not adequate to situation (bad manners ;) ), simply rude.   \nThere is \"elevator etiquete\" , \"door opening etiquete\" etc.   \nGuys you're describing simply don't have good manners, they only think they have them.", "Basic hygiene has nothing to do with genetics.   \nJust shower, wash your hair, use discreet deodorant, use a toothpaste , cut and clean your nails, wear clean clothes. If you have skin problems - take care of them.   \nI don't care if a guy has a body of greek athlete or is just a skinny or bigger and doesn't care about it - what is important to me is his personality and his hygiene, so I have a pleasure being with him. No good looks or great personality will help, if they just smell.", "Yes, it\u2019s the bare minimum.", "This kind of virtue signaling is performed by women all over this site\n\nThen it comes out they're dating tall handsome guys", "So I understand from both perspectives and I\u2019m very proud for gaining enough confidence to say different. I\u2019m not making fun of him for the way he looks, and his looks aren\u2019t the problem. His attitude towards himself is.", "My SO, who is my love from the high school, is short, has big ears that stick out, but beside this he has a lot of other personality and looks good trait. Everybody has something nice in their looks - sometimes it's their eyes, hair, hands, mouth, the shape of their nose or cheekbones -  it's not like people are totally unattractive. So what if my SO is short and has these ears? I don't care, because I love him for other things. It just works like that - I don't need a \"perfect Ken\" , I need a guy who is attractive to me, not to the whole world.  \nEdit:  \nFYI, we are together over 15 years.", "Again, this definitely is the mindset of an attractive person seeing a less attractive person struggle"]}
