The man who holds the door open for you in such a way that there\u2019s not actually room for you to go through. The man who doesn\u2019t take his turn at the 4 way stop because \u201cladies first.\u201d The guy who won\u2019t let you get out of the car after a date because it\u2019s his duty and obligation to get out and open the door for you. It\u2019s awkward and uncomfortable and it doesn\u2019t make our lives easier. So no, old fashioned manners are not attractive.", "Really well-said. Your first sentence made me go, \"huh, never realized that before\", but it's spot-on accurate.", "I met my husband online.....\n\n\nI saw one photo of him....\n\n\nWe spent 3+ months talking.....\n\n\nAfter our FIRST DATE?\n\n\nI told my Mum I wanted to marry him.....\n\n\n\nIn 15 days we celebrate our 11th wedding Anniversary and LOOKS had NOTHING to with it....\n\n\nWe got to know each other.... We liked each other..... We fell in love.....\n\n\nLooks are not gaurenteed..... Personality is.....\n\n\nLove the person not what they look like!", "One time some man who saw me walking by carrying a bunch of stuff decided that I must be too womanly frail to be able to hold things and yanked my box out of my hands despite my protests. It gave me cardboard cuts on my hands. \ud83d\ude43", "> I\u2019m defining respectful and nice to mean \u201ctreats people of all genders like actual human beings with wants and needs, rather than as props to show people how great I am.\u201d\n\nWell that's not an accurate definition so that's the main disconnect.  That's just not being an asshole.", "Right.  You saw the photo and *then* decided to give his personality a chance.  Be honest: if he had had no photo would you have even been open to talking to him?\n\nNow yes, I do absolutely think that personality is core to making a relationship last.  Which IMO is also why boys get taught from such a young age about its importance.  The problem is that the people teaching them this are usually so long into their relationship that they've forgotten how much looks mattered to it starting at all.", "No.\n\n\nI spent about 3 hours taking the piss out of a mutual friend because she did something stupid.....\n\n\n\nStupid enough that her engagement gift referenced it....\n\n\nHer Maid of Honor gift referenced it.......\n\n\nI fell in LOVE with my HUSBAND because of WHO he is.....\n\n\n\nWe literally met without seeing each other and after our FIRST DATE?\n\n\nI told my Mum I was going to marry him....\n\n\nShe did tell me to be careful but...
