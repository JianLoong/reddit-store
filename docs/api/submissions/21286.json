So I have learned to live with it. Her doctors are also in agreement that it is a wasted effort to try and correct such behavior. \n\nMy partner insisted on meeting her, I once again explained why I am against it but they were dead set on meeting my mom. So we went to go meet her, my mom did what my mom does. My partner was crying and got upset with me because I did not even try to defend / correct her.\n\nI explained it is a waste of time, and I told you all of this before hand. They did not expect it to be so scathing. I said my mom does have a sharp tongue. My partner continued to question my actions for tolerating such behavior. I simply replied she is my mom who is sick. Then I started to make jokes about it, and this upset them greatly. I just left it as if I do not laugh I will cry. \n\nThey kept trying to harp on it, calling me a failure of a partner to allow such things to fly. I tried to tell them I explained all of this before hand, yet you still insisted. You think I really was going to go through the effort to try and correct the actions of someone that barely knows who they are half the time? I told them, I already tried to fight that war for years early on in this journey it was just too painful. I had a choice to make learn to accept it or never see my mom again. I love my mom, so I picked the latter. I thought this was the end of it but it happened to come up again at a dinner we had with some friends, pretty much everyone at the table called me and a quote the \"worst type of person\" simply because I did not think it was worth the effort trying to correct the behavior. One even said I should disown my mother. I left after that. \n\nSo AITA for not correcting the behavior, and downplaying the seriousness of the issue? Did I overreact when I left the dinner? Should I have done more to protect the feelings of my partner?\n\nEdit for a quick update to comment on some of things I have read. Before anything I appreciate the kind words, advice, and stories. I know I am not alone in this, but still nice to hear it from others. Secondly I understand the criticism behind my actions and inaction.\n\nI get the idea, i do not agree with it but I get it. My mother is not going to remember what is the harm about correcting her this one time to show support for my partner. I will say the same thing I told my partner. \n\nWe can go home, done we can dust our hands of the interaction and be on our merry way. Problem is this is not about how we may feel about what was said, or how we feel we should go about it. Our feelings in situations such as these are largely moot. I have right to stir up the hornets nest just to leave and let the staff handle the backlash. That shows complete disrespect and disregard for the staff, the other residents, and my mother. \n\nI can see the criticism to this comment you care more about their feelings, tbh in this situation yeah. Cause they are doing me the favor of caring for my mom. Sure I pay for the care, but they treat her with respect and dignity. Why shit on that and make their jobs even harder because my partner wanted to play with fire? I have seen it persoanlly far too many times when families would simply leave after their LO got upset by something they did (and could have avoided) and let the staff deal with it. Their jobs are hard enough as is I have no right to make shit harder and just leave.\n\nLeaving all of that aside it is freaking advised by most medical professionals live in their moment, correcting non violent especially verbal behavior is simply not worth the effort and the potential complications about forcibly altering their reality in that moment. Dementia is often about maintaining comfort and safety. The fact some people on this sub willfully would ignore medical advice because it goes against what the feel is baffling to me.\n\nRacism is a learned behavior, you can have one set of views at one stage in your life, and vastly different one in another stage. Dementia does not care it will draw information from w/e experience it wants. One day my mom is living in a reality when she was working her way through college babysitting and giving piano lessons, others she is a little girl hanging with her dad working on locks (he was a locksmith), sometimes she thinks of me as my father who died when I was a child. It is all over the place. \n\nMy mother was raised by racist fucks, and yeah when she was younger she bought into. That is all she knew and was exposed to. She told me the stories, it was. It until she got older was living on her own that she saw how hurtful and wrapped that ideology was. So no my mom is not racist, her comments are racist and homophobic but she is not. For all those saying she is, people change thing about Dementia it changes people. For the record I am mixed race. So trust me early on it was rough for me to listen to the shit my mom was saying. \n\nNow this criticism I fully understand I should not have joked about the situation, but humor is really all I got at this point to cope. What else could I have said: I told you so? Question why they willfully wanted to play with fire? If I did try to play it off with jokes I would have said something most definitely added vinger and salt to an open wound. My joke was a means of trying to lighten the mood. I will be frank in that moment it was hard for me to have sympathy for my partner as for what was said to them, because I warned then countless times. I plead with them that it was not a good idea. I told them I appreciate the thought but you don't have to. It is not worth it. They kept insisting and insisting I just caved.\n\nShould I have kept saying no? Probably, even if I did 100% they would still be insisting. In the end I figured hey maybe they will be understanding and things would work out. Maybe my mom will see past it since they would be side by side with me. I was foolish and just came up with any idea I could to validate their desire to meet my mom.\n\nI forgot who it was but I will stop using the phrase she does not have a filter cause it implies that she was always this way but knew to hide it. Even if that was not the intent I appreciate. I am also gong to save the stories they warmed my heart. Before I leave this thread to hopefully fade into the ether of AITA. \n\nPlease try to see past black and white, often times things are not that simple. Life is complex, and to simply boil it down to person x is bad because of y does not do anyone justice in situations such as these.", "created_utc": 1688460180, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14q9ht7/aita_for_not_correcting_my_mother_with_dementia/", "score": 3848, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In future, you can insist too, and your decision in this topic is final. They also didn't really listen to you when you talked about how bad it was and called you a 'failure of a partner' for not scolding your Mother.

The idea that it would be \"worth it\" to meet your mother.\n\nI would have said N A H, if your partner was simply hurt and expressed regret. But they are angry at you for not agitating a dementia patient (and going against medical advice) to make them feel better.

It is *not okay* to hold you responsible for that when *they* put themselves in that situation against your advice.", "NTA.

Fifteen minutes later, she'd have forgotten everything again.\n\nIt would be nice if your partner learned more about dementia.

In the early days you may have been able to get through to her and get her to filter her language but you have had years of losing your mother mentally and it is not the quick fix that people think.  Dementia is one of the most devastating diseases for the family to deal with.  \"Then I started to make jokes about it, and this upset them greatly. I just left it as if I do not laugh I will cry\" - this is the only way we can cope with it sometimes as otherwise our own mental health would suffer.\n\nYou warned your partner many many times but she insisted on meeting your mother.   Maybe some of your \"friends\" should visit a home for people with dementia and see for themselves the progression of it, including the way some patients descend into violence.

Next time they should trust you when it comes to your family. \n\nAs someone who previously worked with dementia care patients, they are stuck in another time. It is absolutely useless to try to correct them and the situation would have only escalated and gotten worse if you did try to correct them. It sucks, but it is what it is. Their brain is not there present with you in 2023 and they have such a cognitive disability due to brain degeneration that it really isn\u2019t their fault.

Their mind is broken, they are suffering. That doesn\u2019t excuse their behavior, and certainly doesn\u2019t mean anyone HAS to be okay with it. But this isn\u2019t a matter of morality, the only comparison I could make would be like punishing a child with a mental disability for rude outbursts. It\u2019s still not even a great comparison. But your partner needs to understand there is quite literally nothing you can do about it. Whatever action of defending her or reprimanding your mother would simply be a charade for their pride. I know that\u2019s harsh to say and I have a hard time saying it with something as serious as racist or homophobic comments, I\u2019m not trying to pretend as if your partner is wrong for being hurt. But the fact is you warned them, and they still chose and downright insisted on being introduced. It\u2019s usually difficult for people to actually have dementia in their face. They can be told or read about it, but the shock is still tremendous so I will cut them slack there. However they will be the AH if they continue to harp on this. You have SO MUCH on your plate and really have to focus on taking care of yourself. The last 6 years especially the last 9 months of my grandmas life with dementia was by far the most emotionally devastating, physically demanding and detrimental time in my families life. It\u2019s hard to even put into words how much work goes into to caring for someone while simultaneously grieving them before they are even gone. You are watching someone you love more than anything slip away right in front of you. One day she won\u2019t even recognize who you are, and people need to realize it goes so far beyond memory. Oftentimes dementia can turn someone into an entirely different person. A person without impulse control, possibly even violent and cruel. But you need support right now, and this simply isn\u2019t gonna fit on your plate. Arguing with someone with dementia is like arguing with a toddler, she probably doesn\u2019t even know what planet she\u2019s on right now. On top of that it will actually cause more issues and distress to argue with them to both of you. I literally sat and fed my grandmas baby doll for two hours, burped it, changed the diaper and rocked it to sleep all damn day because she was convinced it was a real baby and I wasn\u2019t taking good care of it. But it made her happy, it kept her calm and her mind engaged to just sit with me and my baby. You will do whatever it takes for a day of peace.", "NTA. I\u2019m going thru this with my partner and grandma right now. When they first met she wasn\u2019t diagnosed and was sweet as pie but now that it\u2019s progressed she is rude and has a poison tongue.

The aids love her. \n\nI think this dynamic of people looking past the poor behavior and seeing the person for who they are  / where created a different picture.", "And in some cases, like my grandma for example it wasn\u2019t even stuck in another time. She would revert to almost a toddler, so any person that was unusual to her would cause distress. She\u2019d have these rare fleeting moments even up until the end where she\u2019d be lucid and herself. But what she was most often was an entirely different person. She could be mean, and cruel. She would do things she\u2019s never in her life done like call us names or slap us - things that were wildly of character for her.", "Her mood and personality changes are mostly trigger based. So many things alter her mood and personality. She has her moments when you would be hard pressed to know she has dementia. When she is as spark as ever. Her lucid moments are great. \n\nOthers she is like a toddler. Hard to put a number in it via a scale but let's say about a five cause it is a coin flip.\n\nThe racist and homophobic behavior is deep seeded trauma and indoctrination by my grandparents it is most likely long term memory as her doctor puts it. Correcting the behavior also makes her annoyed and visibly stressed so her care team suggested to leave non violent behavior largely uncorrected because it puts her in a loop of being on edge.\n\nEdit: Sorry misread your comment, she is currently mild to serve in terms of her dementia. \n\nIn terms of raw functionality such as completing tasks she is capable of doing it with queuing and prompting. She cannot follow multi step tasks but if you tell her to do one thing at a time she is able to complete the task without physical assistance. \n\nIn terms of cognitive ability it is middle ground.

Their brains are literally broken, so there are a lot of lesser known little details most aren\u2019t aware of. Very often patients will dig their heels into an argument long after they\u2019ve forgotten what they are even arguing about, so now you have a person who is hostile but doesn\u2019t know why- it can cause major major meltdowns and could become violent and even needed to be sedated.

Behaviors once corrected or change na show up. Things are forgotten not lost especially things taught as a child. \n\n2) Yes, in private ran facilities it is taught to try and not correct non physically harmful behavior. The staff is trained to understand that they are dealing with people that have no real control over their actions. What is often suggested is redirection if possible and if the person in question can be redirected. For some redirection has a similar impact as correct so that is avoided. Others means are providing a one to one someone akin to a paraprofessional that has a good relationship to serve as a buffer to a degree that will serve to even aid the person avoid the triggers or mitigate the trigger in some shape or form.\n\nYou cannot correct or prevent them from saying the N word. As the facility my mother is in, this is not a place for the faint of heart if you are easily triggered and cannot leave the personal baggage at home and work through the BS and treat each person with respect and dignity then they are not hired.\n\nYour knowledge and experience are extremely dated and seem based off the dated concept the disease can be corrected or somehow behaviors can be altered by repeated correction. Since unless you are drugging them up I just do not see how you don't let the person with dementia be or protect someone from verbal abuse such as the N word. \n\nNow if you are suggesting anti depressants can be used to mitigate poor behavior in some cases but that behavior  that is corrected generally stems from anxiety, depression or something along those lines. \n\nIf the behavior is brought on by a trigger then generally those medications do not provide much benefit since they will often not be enough to override what the person feels when they are exposed to the trigger.\n\nIf the behavior is physical in nature and extremely harmful then yes I agree that behavior is still corrected ASAP.\n\n\n3) You are also masking the reason why medication such as Seroquel are given they are often given to ease bouts of anxiety and general increase overall quality of life especially in those with extra restlessness. They are not given to correct a behavior, in some cases of extreme bouts of anxiety maybe something stronger will be given. That said point I was trying to make when it comes to verbal behavior medication is often not very effective especially if it is trigger based. Since it will not alter what a person feels or gets triggered by in many cases unless it is generally a higher dose of a sedative. Which does not bypass the response to the trigger but more so makes it so they feel less likely to act on the trigger. Creating a fake impulse control so to speak.\n\nBefore medication is generally advised to try non chemical interventions before anything and often that means accepting the reality even if it is verbal abuse.\n\nYour a nurse all of this was how my mother's doctors explained it to me because early on I was trying my best to correct the behavior when it first started.", "Dude..

So, whether you mean to or not, you are telling your partner you see being a racist homophobe as no impediment to being a \"lovely\" person and NBD...which is probably causing some worries in your partner about you.

Then you watch the slow decline...paranoia,  crying , not knowing their families, and the worst is anger.  I've been accused of theft, called names, swung at.

This entire thing must be so painful for you.", "YTA, why? correcting your mother isn't about if your mom can \"learn\" not to be racist and homophobic, it's about showing you don't find it acceptable.

A dementia patient can't remember why something is true but he doesn't mean you don't remind them anyways.

Your mom said awful things to your partner and you didn\u2019t say anything (I understand why you didn\u2019t, but that\u2019s not the point) and afterwords you seem to be dismissing your girlfriend\u2019s feelings (I know you warned her before hand, but that\u2019s not okay.)\n\nLet your girlfriend cool off, apologize for being dismissive of her feelings, and have a conversation with her about what the two of you should do.

Before this she was a very sweet person. The last year before her death was during covid so I didn\u2019t visit her much but she was basically catatonic, she\u2019d just stare blankly ahead holding a baby doll.

After the dementia kicked in, it became a huge problem. The majority of aged care workers are people of colour/immigrants, and she made her opinion of them very, very clear. It was incredibly hard to listen to my grandma, who I loved, express such awful things to the people who were helping her dress, eat, and use the bathroom.
