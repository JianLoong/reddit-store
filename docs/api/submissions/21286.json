Your partner clearly does not fully understand dementia at all. If this is someone you would like you stay with I suggest the both of you go talk to a dementia specialist charity who can explain things. Sometimes it\u2019s easier to hear things from an expert.", "NTA. I'm sorry you're going through this and are stuck with such shitty friends and a partner. Dementia is a beast of a disease. Anyone who will claim with confidence that this is who your Mother has always been isn't doing their research. You've spoken to her doctors who agree that at this stage constant corrections would be futile. \n\nYour partner is a massive AH. You specifically said they should not meet but they insisted. In future, you can insist too, and your decision in this topic is final. They also didn't really listen to you when you talked about how bad it was and called you a 'failure of a partner' for not scolding your Mother. I'm sorry but this person sounds like a massive bellend. Is this person really an adequate support system? Cause it doesn't sound like they either listened to you or attempted to gain even a basic understanding of this disease.", "NTA. It's a sad situation. You warned your partner before hand which is why you're NTA. You understand there is no point trying to get through to your mother.", "100% NTA. Firstly do your partner and friends even understand dementia? Secondly your mom is not you. You're not responsible for her racist and homophobic behavior. Your partner and friends trying to guilt trip you into disowning your mother is narcissism at its finest. Thirdly was your partner who insisted on meeting a racist homophobic person expecting said person to be lovely?", "NTA. Dementia is not like being drunk. It's not a sober thoughts situation, it's the brain rotting. There is no \"defending\" against someone with dementia, you'd be better off fighting a brick wall.\n\nIt must have really hurt your partner to meet your mother and be attacked and insulted. I'm sure you were transparent with your partner, but I'm also sure that meeting the parents is such an important thing in a relationship that they simply couldn't or wouldn't comprehend how serious you were. The idea that it would be \"worth it\" to meet your mother.\n\nI would have said N A H, if your partner was simply hurt and expressed regret. But they are angry at you for not agitating a dementia patient (and going against medical advice) to make them feel better. It's okay for them to be hurt by what was said and disappointed that meeting your mother went badly. It is *not okay* to hold you responsible for that when *they* put themselves in that situation against your advice.", "NTA. Only because there\u2019s nothing you could do because she\u2019d just forget what you said shortly after. If something like this comes up again though I would suggest acting accordingly.", "NTA.  I have an older family member with dementia.  She doesn't always recognize us.  She enquires constantly after her long-deceased husband, and doesn't know what decade it is or which continent she's on.  We don't correct her; in fact, we lie to her (yes, her husband is at work, yes, he'll be back for dinner, or tomorrow).  If we don't (and we tried this back in the day), she became terrified and uncontrollable -- and what was the point?  Fifteen minutes later, she'd have forgotten everything again.\n\nIt would be nice if your partner learned more about dementia.  It would also be fine if she didn't interact with your mother, exactly as you wanted -- your mother doesn't understand what's going on and doesn't benefit, while your partner will be hurt.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA\n\nHaving a fair bit of experience with dementia patients what you are saying makes complete sense.  In the early days you may have been able to get through to her and get her to filter her language but you have had years of losing your mother mentally and it is not the quick fix that people think.  Dementia is one of the most devastating diseases for the family to deal with.  \"Then I started to make jokes about it, and this upset them greatly. I just left it as if I do not laugh I will cry\" - this is the only way we can cope with it sometimes as otherwise our own mental health would suffer.\n\nYou warned your partner many many times but she insisted on meeting your mother.   Maybe some of your \"friends\" should visit a home for people with dementia and see for themselves the progression of it, including the way some patients descend into violence.  That may give them enough of a jolt to realise that it is an ILLNESS not just a mindset.\n\nStay strong.", "NTA and this is a FAFO for your partner. \n\nYou gave a warning and you tried to prevent this, they did not listen and now they got their feelings hurt. Next time they should trust you when it comes to your family. \n\nAs someone who previously worked with dementia care patients, they are stuck in another time. It is absolutely useless to try to correct them and the situation would have only escalated and gotten worse if you did try to correct them. It sucks, but it is what it is. Their brain is not there present with you in 2023 and they have such a cognitive disability due to brain degeneration that it really isn\u2019t their fault. Even people who previously were not mean sometimes become the nastiest people when they get dementia. It\u2019s like when someone gets a TBI and their whole personality changes. It sucks and it is heartbreaking but the brain is permanently altered and there is nothing you can do.", "NTA \n\nMy dad had dementia and I spoke to someone who specialised in dementia. They told me it\u2019s best not to argue with them. It was awful with my dad, arguing just didn\u2019t get anywhere. \n\nMy dad was a pretty left leaning guy until he had dementia and then he started to have some conservative things to say", "NTA.  I'm dealing with similar behavior by my (50M) dad (78M), if not quite as bad as what you have described...yet.\n\nIt is difficult for those who have never interacted with a dementia/Alzheimer's patient before to understand what they are going through, never mind what you are going through as the care giver.  You did warn your partner about what to expect, but clearly they did not believe it would be as bad as you told them.  Your other \"friends\" simply don't get it, and the ignoramus who suggested you disown your mother should just be ignored.\n\nFor both your partner and yourself, I will suggest the book *Essential Strategies for the Dementia Caregiver:  Learning to PACE Yourself*, by Tami Anastasia:  [https://tamianastasia.com/book/](https://tamianastasia.com/book/)\n\nThis book will hopefully give you some additional tools to help you with your mom, and perhaps show your partner that this sort of behavior is unfortunately common, but also a non-correctable symptom of the disease, not some kind of moral failure.\n\nI hope this helps.", "NAH!! Dementia is a difficult ailment.", "INFO: OP on a scale on 1-10, how bad would you say your mom's Dementia is? Is she mostly herself with the occasional bad spell, or has the dementia progressed  badly and these days she is more of someone that she wasn't before? \n\nI don't really think anyone is in a position to comment until we know this, because imo it depends on the severity of the Dementia.\n\n**Edit**\n\nWhy tf am I being downvoted on this? I was more than respectful, fair and trying to understand the situation better so I can share my opinion better.\n\nAnyone who has known or dealt with a loved one who has Dementia, understands that there are levels to it, stages, progressions, recessions, it goes on and on. \n\nFor example I have a son with severe Autism and he's none verbal. He occasionally lashes violently and gets distressed, and of course this is in no way shape or form his fault at all, I'd NEVER even dream of trying to reprimand him.  But there are other Autistic people out there that are \"High functioning\" (not that I like that phrase) that absolutely do know the difference between right and wrong, and despite the diagnosis they know and are self aware it's not okay to hit people. \n\nObviously this isn't exactly the same, but it's the same principle.

Their mind is broken, they are suffering. That doesn\u2019t excuse their behavior, and certainly doesn\u2019t mean anyone HAS to be okay with it. But this isn\u2019t a matter of morality, the only comparison I could make would be like punishing a child with a mental disability for rude outbursts. It\u2019s still not even a great comparison. But your partner needs to understand there is quite literally nothing you can do about it. Whatever action of defending her or reprimanding your mother would simply be a charade for their pride. I know that\u2019s harsh to say and I have a hard time saying it with something as serious as racist or homophobic comments, I\u2019m not trying to pretend as if your partner is wrong for being hurt. But the fact is you warned them, and they still chose and downright insisted on being introduced. It\u2019s usually difficult for people to actually have dementia in their face. They can be told or read about it, but the shock is still tremendous so I will cut them slack there. However they will be the AH if they continue to harp on this. You have SO MUCH on your plate and really have to focus on taking care of yourself. The last 6 years especially the last 9 months of my grandmas life with dementia was by far the most emotionally devastating, physically demanding and detrimental time in my families life. It\u2019s hard to even put into words how much work goes into to caring for someone while simultaneously grieving them before they are even gone. You are watching someone you love more than anything slip away right in front of you. One day she won\u2019t even recognize who you are, and people need to realize it goes so far beyond memory. Oftentimes dementia can turn someone into an entirely different person. A person without impulse control, possibly even violent and cruel. But you need support right now, and this simply isn\u2019t gonna fit on your plate. Arguing with someone with dementia is like arguing with a toddler, she probably doesn\u2019t even know what planet she\u2019s on right now. On top of that it will actually cause more issues and distress to argue with them to both of you. I literally sat and fed my grandmas baby doll for two hours, burped it, changed the diaper and rocked it to sleep all damn day because she was convinced it was a real baby and I wasn\u2019t taking good care of it. But it made her happy, it kept her calm and her mind engaged to just sit with me and my baby. You will do whatever it takes for a day of peace.", "NTA. I\u2019m going thru this with my partner and grandma right now. When they first met she wasn\u2019t diagnosed and was sweet as pie but now that it\u2019s progressed she is rude and has a poison tongue. Luckily he understands as his grandma also had dementia before she passed but it doesn\u2019t make it any easier.", "NTA. Your mother has dementia, which can affect her behaviour as well as her memory. Any ship of correcting her behaviour has long sailed. Your partner can choose not to visit your mother.", "NTA\nDementia sucks. I am sorry your partner doesn't understand this. Maybe there is a dementia not for profit they can go to for some educational sessions?", "I will admit the lovely aspect might be my fault cause my mom is a lovely person at the core. I think my mixed signals might have caused confusion cause when I speak of her I have nothing but positive things to say in the general sense. When I call to check up and speak with the aids just to check up via FaceTime my mom is always as happy as can be. The aids love her. \n\nI think this dynamic of people looking past the poor behavior and seeing the person for who they are  / where created a different picture.", "And in some cases, like my grandma for example it wasn\u2019t even stuck in another time. She would revert to almost a toddler, so any person that was unusual to her would cause distress. She\u2019d have these rare fleeting moments even up until the end where she\u2019d be lucid and herself. But what she was most often was an entirely different person. She could be mean, and cruel. She would do things she\u2019s never in her life done like call us names or slap us - things that were wildly of character for her.", "Her mood and personality changes are mostly trigger based. So many things alter her mood and personality. She has her moments when you would be hard pressed to know she has dementia. When she is as spark as ever. Her lucid moments are great. \n\nOthers she is like a toddler. Hard to put a number in it via a scale but let's say about a five cause it is a coin flip.\n\nThe racist and homophobic behavior is deep seeded trauma and indoctrination by my grandparents it is most likely long term memory as her doctor puts it. Correcting the behavior also makes her annoyed and visibly stressed so her care team suggested to leave non violent behavior largely uncorrected because it puts her in a loop of being on edge.\n\nEdit: Sorry misread your comment, she is currently mild to serve in terms of her dementia. \n\nIn terms of raw functionality such as completing tasks she is capable of doing it with queuing and prompting. She cannot follow multi step tasks but if you tell her to do one thing at a time she is able to complete the task without physical assistance. \n\nIn terms of cognitive ability it is middle ground. She has an understanding of place and has awareness that she is suffering from an illness. She can convey feelings, such a love, happiness, sadness, angry.\n\nShe does have moments of extreme confusion though.", "Main issue with correcting the behavior is, I can go home afterwards. The staff then has to deal with the backlash after I have left. It is not fair to the staff to alter the comfort of the resident cause it can have a domino effect. Her anxiety shoots up, then spreads to others. \n\nCorrecting the behaviors is often the worse thing you can do.", "Actually, no, she shouldn't have. This probably would have made things worse.", "It\u2019s really dangerous to argue with someone with dementia, it\u2019s can cause huge distress and major meltdowns. Their brains are literally broken, so there are a lot of lesser known little details most aren\u2019t aware of. Very often patients will dig their heels into an argument long after they\u2019ve forgotten what they are even arguing about, so now you have a person who is hostile but doesn\u2019t know why- it can cause major major meltdowns and could become violent and even needed to be sedated. It\u2019s crucial to preserve the peace and mood for their stability sake. But it\u2019s really hard to navigate an illness that literally changes who someone is, and watch them deteriorate further with no end in sight.", "I don't agree with you but i would really like to know why you think so", "Did your mom at any point insult your partner or your relationship with them?

This isn\u2019t the case here. You can only focus on the good parts. There no indication of her mistreating you before her being sick, so there no reasons to hold her accountable for a symptom of her dementia. \n\nYour friend and partner seem to believe it\u2019s a personality feature your mom can control.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful, or even possible to change or correct that, but I genuinely think it\u2019s important to acknowledge it. You can love her, and also love your partner enough to keep them apart. You\u2019re not a bad person, and you don\u2019t need to disown your mom. Just don\u2019t make excuses for her.

Cancel culture has just gone way too far\u2026", "NTA. You did everything you could have done to prepare your partner, but some things require experience to understand. People generally think dementia only affects the ability to hold onto and create new memories, when it\u2019s actually a terminal disease that affects everything from emotions to breathing.\n\nMy dad had early onset Alzheimer\u2019s. He had been a therapist and social worker before he became sick. About 5 years later he was punching people and not remembering it a few minutes later. The only reason he was never arrested was everyone knew him and liked him. \n\nIf your partner is receptive after having a few days to cool off, try providing some information on dementia. It might help if they understand why trying to get your mother to change won\u2019t work, and you will need the support as your mother\u2019s condition worsens.", "I care for my grandparents full time BOTH of whom have dementia and other health issues.\nYou're SO MUCH NTA OP.", "NTA. It is widely known that it's not helpful to correct people with dementia; instead we should try to live in their world with them. Your mother's world sounds as though it's got downsides as well as upsides but you are not wrong to take the approach you did. Sounds like your partner just hasn't got that life experience/awareness of dementia yet.", "Sorry you after going through this crap with both your mom and partner. \n\nI don't think a lot of people get how dementia can either intensify flaws or bring forward ones that never existed. My uncle went from my superman to perv in the blink of an eye.... Yet when he wanted to go home (he was already home) he would scream for me and only me to take him home. Just to calm him down, I would put him in my car, drive him around the block and say 'Look you're home!' And he would be sooo happy, that he would try to SA me. Every frickin time. But it was the disease, not him. And I put up with it for my aunts sanity and the briefest moment of joy in my uncle diminished life. \n\nNTA. Your SO and friends need some empathy. There is no correcting... You can be harsh if you want and tell them not to worry.... Soon they'll forget how to swallow and starve to death... or choke on their own saliva and die.... or forget how to breathe....", "NTA because dementia is a bitch and you gave plenty of information and warnings beforehand which fell on your deaf ears. \n\nBit on the edge about immediately joking about it though because I can understand that would be difficult to witness especially when your partner was already reduced to tears.", "Your mother is not going to stop having dementia. It's not as though she's *well*. NTA. \n\n> Should I have done more to protect the feelings of my partner?\n\nWell, you could've flat-out refused to have them meet your mother, but I get the feeling that they would have kept pressuring you about it.", "NTA.\n\nYou are 100 percent right, you cannot reason, apply logic to a discussion with someone with dementia.", "NTA unless they have ever dealt with someone with dementia they have no idea how hard it is or what kinds of things you deal with. You warned your partner and they insisted it\u2019s on them.", "NTA and your partner sucks hard for pushing this issue and traumatising you. You gave them multiple warnings, you explained how difficult this has been to manage, but they prioritised their own needs before yours. \n\nDementia is a horrendous disease. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through it.\n\nDump your partner. They have no respect for you. Narcissists often provoke a situation where they end up the victim. Sounds like the shoe fits.\n\nNTA", "No assholes here? Really? Because i think OP's partner is an asshole for bitching, crying and blaming OP after they were warned exactly what was going to happen.", "Why is this being downvoted? Partner brought it to themselves, and both them and their friends were shitty to not let it go, but joking about it after that knowing it was upsetting is an AH move, just a tiny one in the story.", "It sounds like the mum wasn\u2019t like that when she was in control of herself. And since correcting the behaviour a) won\u2019t work and b) even if it worked would only work for a really short time, there\u2019s no point. It\u2019s just causing extra stress for everyone (OP, the aides, the mum).", "You clearly don't understand dementia, sorry.", ">Families need to stop thinking it is okay to just dump parents off in a home and let others watch them because they cannot handle it\n\n\n\nSo you agree that families \"dump\" Their relatives to people that are better equipped to handle them Because they cannot take care of them and yet\n\n\"Families need to stop thinking it is okay... \"\n\n\n\n>Such behavior is mentally and emotionally taxing and the fact you prioritize the feelings and comfort of a brain rotting bigot is laughable.\n\n\n\nSo Op's partner despite repeated warnings but who insisted they wanted to meet their \n\nAccording to you\n\n\"Brain rotting bigot\" Partner's parent is the innocent passerby here. \n\n\nDude, \nYou can afford this your high throne and jump on this your soapbox because you have not walked in the shoes of families dealing with relatives with dementia. \nThat is something to be grateful for.", "So, so true.\n\nThis is what I would like to say to your partner:\n\nOP is going through hell, and if you can\u2019t understand this and support them, walk away now.\n\nDementia is the constant ongoing piecemeal loss of the person you love. The grief is constant. You learn to cope and accept, as OP is doing. But you can\u2019t get work through it, because there is always something new to mourn, some new change or decline. And there\u2019s nothing to hope for. No cure. No improvement. Only the death of this person you love so much.\n\nIt may have hurt for you to hear what OP\u2019s mother said. Don\u2019t you think it hurts OP too? OP isn\u2019t choosing to let someone abuse *you.* OP is coping with someone they love very much whose *illness* makes her incapable of not being awful to both of you.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about you, OP\u2019s partner.\n\nPlease step up and find some empathy for someone you supposedly care about who is going through a quiet daily hell.", "Okay in that case I'm going to go with NTA. If she's gotten to the point where she is like this, it's completely out of her control.\n\nDoes she make these types of comments when she's lucid, or just when she's at her worst?", "oh wow okay I didn\u2019t know this. this changes my perspective completely. my thing being is the writer isn\u2019t the AH at all- moreover their partner. thank you for this, makes me think differently", "That line of thinking is wrong, and people just kind themselves into thinking that to justify their willful compliance in propagating abuse in the workplace. Reality is this the people that \"choose\" if you can call it a choice, do not do it because they are better equipped they are human like everyone else. They do it because often that is all they can do for whatever reason. \n\nThe staff of these places are often undertrained, underpaid, understaffed, and overworked. Yet families expect them to walk around with a smile taking abuse day in and day out. Fuck that, if family does not want to deal with such behavior why is it fair to have strangers deal with it? These people should be treated like any other person that cannot operate within the the norms we have established via our social contract. Cannot act like a civilized human being lock and drug them up. Let them rot in a cell just as their brains rot. \n\nAs many said they will not get better right? So why prolong their suffering, and expose others to further suffering to \"care\" for someone that as many have that may not even know where they are?\n\nWhy do you think abuse is so high in these places? Because they are viewed as less then human by many that work in those buildings. Imagine only getting paid minimum wage, to pretty much get abused day in and day out? As many have said this is common behavior, yet who predominantly staff many of these places? \n\nSo what you are saying is people of color, minorities etc should be exposed to such behavior because this is the only job that they can get? Awesome.", "It is a trigger for her, even when she is lucid certain things just flip her switch so to speak.", "I don\u2019t think the partner is an AH - just possibly less informed like you. It\u2019s okay, it\u2019s not super well known info. However if the partner takes the route his friends are taking- yeah I\u2019d say that\u2019s an AH.

Kill the relatives? Abandon them at home to rot in their beds? \n\n\n\n>So what you are saying is people of color, minorities etc should be exposed to such behavior because this is the only job that they can get? Awesome.\n\n\nI am a person of color. Had a grandma that wasn't all there when she was going. I never forgot the woman she was and though some days are harder than others, I treasured every moment she was here. Even when she was insulting towards me- her grandchild. So, as a person of color, if you tell me to hold my peace because your relative is struggling with dementia, I will take their shit. \n\n\nAgain dear internet stranger, \n>Yet families expect them to walk around with a smile taking abuse day in and day out. Fuck that, if family does not want to deal with such behavior why is it fair to have strangers deal with it?\n\n\n\nIf you don't like your job, find another. \n\nThis is how the world works.

Her partner is the one who seems to lack the understanding here. \n\n\nUntil you get us a better solution, be grateful for your high throne and soapbox.", "She literally does have an excuse tho. Brain damage", "Possibly, but they also could just be in shock seeing it in person for themselves. It\u2019s one think to mentally prepare and another to experience. I wouldn\u2019t have an issue if they were hurt. That\u2019s understandable, but holding you accountable and expecting you to try and argue with your mother who is ill is just not fair. I\u2019m hoping with some more information and understanding your partner will understand. I\u2019m gonna assume they wanted to support you and maybe have never seen this before, and didn\u2019t realize just how severe it\u2019d be. Maybe assumed you were being dramatic with your warning. But your friends that are insisting you cut her off and whatever are absolutely batshit insane", "They might not even realise their own delusional expectations. \n\nHowever once the fantasy bubble bursted, and the turmoil of feeling had settled down. There some apologies owned to you about how they didn\u2019t understood really the depth of what you tried to explain to them. \n\nI can\u2019t find justifications for your friend, as their reaction can\u2019t be dulled with an emotional confrontation.", "While your partner was an asshole, I also I think you could have said 'look, she said terrible things, but I love her as she is my mother and people with dementia often say terrible things they don't mean'. Cracking jokes and telling people she is lovely was.....not the right way to go. Because no, she is not lovely if she is saying horrific racist things. \n\nIDK if you are yt or not, but I'm mixed race and while I understand how fucked up dementia is I would react poorly if I was at that dinner table, too. \n\nTLDR: People understand loving one's mother or father, even if that person is terrible (or the terrible behavior is brought on by a disease). Minimizing that terrible behavior or insisting that person is lovely isn't great. Your partner was also an asshole for bringing it up in front of your friend s in the first place, too.", "Completely understand, I was very close to my Grandfather who had Dementia, he was similar.\n\nHow much does your SO really know and understand Dementia, do you think he'd benefit from brushing up on his research and understanding? No shade.\n\nI just can't understand why he'd have the reaction he had, if he understood Dementia properly. Like if someone didn't really understand tourrettes and they got swore at and got offended, that's more not being informed and ignorant as opposed to being an asshole.\n\nIf he has a very good understanding of Dementia and STILL made these comments and had that reaction, then you have a huge issue on your hands OP, because imo that is appalling the way he reacted.", "Brain damage does not make someone a bigot.", "This is where I disagree my mother is a lovely person, I know it is hard to see it that way cause she does say bigoted things. I did not say her actions in that moment were lovely but at the core she is still the warm and loving person she always was prior. \n\nJust because she said those things does not mean she is a mean or horrible person. It is hard for me to explain but we learn to look past those behaviors and see what is at the core. I know it is weird but I do not think they should be judged for behavior outside of their control and have it held against them.", "That is what I am also trying to figure out. Allegedly they have had past experiences with dementia one of the reasons why they insisted. I think their experience was when they were a child, so their experience and understanding might be skewed. \n\nMy mom does not act this way towards children. One of the staff members brings their kid to work on Sunday and my mom is great with her. My mom is teaching her how to play the piano.\n\nThink it just one of those moments where they either are shell shocked to hear such things openly said without interruption and mistake the general acceptance for approval. \n\nOr maybe they thought since they showed up with me it would not be an issue. I do not know.", "They aren\u2019t a bigot. \n\nDementia can affect a person's ability to make decisions because it can affect the parts of the brain involved in remembering, understanding and processing information. \n\nShe literally can\u2019t learn or remember that she had learned something. She has no filter that would stop her from saying ignorant thing she would have previously forgot. \n\nOp literally stated their mother forgot", "Dementia is terrifying for both the patient and their family. Your partner was an absolute arse. I am so sorry that you are both experiencing this. I hope you get as much time with your mother as possible.", "It does read a lot to me that he isn't educated enough on Dementia. If It was me there, your mum could have screamed all the obscenities in the world at me and I wouldn't have said a word, It wouldn't be a problem at all. But that's because I've been through it and understand it very well. Like honestly, the stuff my grandfather used to come out with was VILE \ud83d\ude05\n\nYou have a right to be upset with him, but he has no right to be upset with you. I would honestly ask him to go away, do a few hours research (right here on Reddit is a great start) and then come back with any questions. He's in the wrong but he doesn't see it, because he doesn't understand it.\n\nIf after all of that he has the same viewpoint and opinion...well, that's a whole other issue."]}
