There is absolutely nothing you can do, and it generally only gets worse over time.\n\nYou did your best to explain to your partner, and they chose not to heed your warning. Everything that happened as soon as they opened that door is on them, not you.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your partner needs to be educated about dementia.  For those who don't know, it's a FATAL brain disease. Correcting the behavior could result in a catastrophic meltdown. There are specific strategies for working with people with dementia. \n\nThere is a ton of educational information online", "NTA  firstly I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this with your mother, it\u2019s such an awful condition. Your partner clearly does not fully understand dementia at all. If this is someone you would like you stay with I suggest the both of you go talk to a dementia specialist charity who can explain things. Sometimes it\u2019s easier to hear things from an expert.", "NTA. I'm sorry you're going through this and are stuck with such shitty friends and a partner. Dementia is a beast of a disease. Anyone who will claim with confidence that this is who your Mother has always been isn't doing their research. You've spoken to her doctors who agree that at this stage constant corrections would be futile. \n\nYour partner is a massive AH. You specifically said they should not meet but they insisted. In future, you can insist too, and your decision in this topic is final. They also didn't really listen to you when you talked about how bad it was and called you a 'failure of a partner' for not scolding your Mother. I'm sorry but this person sounds like a massive bellend. Is this person really an adequate support system? Cause it doesn't sound like they either listened to you or attempted to gain even a basic understanding of this disease.", "NTA. It's a sad situation. You warned your partner before hand which is why you're NTA. You understand there is no point trying to get through to your mother.", "100% NTA. Firstly do your partner and friends even understand dementia? Secondly your mom is not you. You're not responsible for her racist and homophobic behavior. Your partner and friends trying to guilt trip you into disowning your mother is narcissism at its finest. Thirdly was your partner who insisted on meeting a racist homophobic person expecting said person to be lovely?", "NTA. Dementia is not like being drunk. It's not a sober thoughts situation, it's the brain rotting. There is no \"defending\" against someone with dementia, you'd be better off fighting a brick wall.\n\nIt must have really hurt your partner to meet your mother and be attacked and insulted. I'm sure you were transparent with your partner, but I'm also sure that meeting the parents is such an important thing in a relationship that they simply couldn't or wouldn't comprehend how serious you were. The idea that it would be \"worth it\" to meet your mother.\n\nI would have said N A H, if your partner was simply hurt and expressed regret. But they are angry at you for not agitating a dementia patient (and going against medical advice) to make them feel better. It's okay for them to be hurt by what was said and disappointed that meeting your mother went badly. It is *not okay* to hold you responsible for that when *they* put themselves in that situation against your advice.", "NTA. Only because there\u2019s nothing you could do because she\u2019d just forget what you said shortly after. If something like this comes up again though I would suggest acting accordingly.", "NTA.  I have an older family member with dementia.  She doesn't always recognize us.  She enquires constantly after her long-deceased husband, and doesn't know what decade it is or which continent she's on.  We don't correct her; in fact, we lie to her (yes, her husband is at work, yes, he'll be back for dinner, or tomorrow).  If we don't (and we tried this back in the day), she became terrified and uncontrollable -- and what was the point?  Fifteen minutes later, she'd have forgotten everything again.\n\nIt would be nice if your partner learned more about dementia.  It would also be fine if she didn't interact with your mother, exactly as you wanted -- your mother doesn't understand what's going on and doesn't benefit, while your partner will be hurt.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA\n\nHaving a fair bit of experience with dementia patients what you are saying makes complete sense.  In the early days you may have been able to get through to her and get her to filter her language but you have had years of losing your mother mentally and it is not the quick fix that people think.  Dementia is one of the most devastating diseases for the family to deal with.  \"Then I started to make jokes about it, and this upset them greatly. I just left it as if I do not laugh I will cry\" - this is the only way we can cope with it sometimes as otherwise our own mental health would suffer.\n\nYou warned your partner many many times but she insisted on meeting your mother.   Maybe some of your \"friends\" should visit a home for people with dementia and see for themselves the progression of it, including the way some patients descend into violence.  That may give them enough of a jolt to realise that it is an ILLNESS not just a mindset.\n\nStay strong.", "NTA and this is a FAFO for your partner. \n\nYou gave a warning and you tried to prevent this, they did not listen and now they got their feelings hurt. Next time they should trust you when it comes to your family. \n\nAs someone who previously worked with dementia care patients, they are stuck in another time. It is absolutely useless to try to correct them and the situation would have only escalated and gotten worse if you did try to correct them. It sucks, but it is what it is. Their brain is not there present with you in 2023 and they have such a cognitive disability due to brain degeneration that it really isn\u2019t their fault. Even people who previously were not mean sometimes become the nastiest people when they get dementia. It\u2019s like when someone gets a TBI and their whole personality changes. It sucks and it is heartbreaking but the brain is permanently altered and there is nothing you can do.", "NTA \n\nMy dad had dementia and I spoke to someone who specialised in dementia. They told me it\u2019s best not to argue with them. It was awful with my dad, arguing just didn\u2019t get anywhere. \n\nMy dad was a pretty left leaning guy until he had dementia and then he started to have some conservative things to say", "NTA.  I'm dealing with similar behavior by my (50M) dad (78M), if not quite as bad as what you have described...yet.\n\nIt is difficult for those who have never interacted with a dementia/Alzheimer's patient before to understand what they are going through, never mind what you are going through as the care giver.  You did warn your partner about what to expect, but clearly they did not believe it would be as bad as you told them.  Your other \"friends\" simply don't get it, and the ignoramus who suggested you disown your mother should just be ignored.\n\nFor both your partner and yourself, I will suggest the book *Essential Strategies for the Dementia Caregiver:  Learning to PACE Yourself*, by Tami Anastasia:  [https://tamianastasia.com/book/](https://tamianastasia.com/book/)\n\nThis book will hopefully give you some additional tools to help you with your mom, and perhaps show your partner that this sort of behavior is unfortunately common, but also a non-correctable symptom of the disease, not some kind of moral failure.\n\nI hope this helps.", "NAH!! Dementia is a difficult ailment.", "INFO: OP on a scale on 1-10, how bad would you say your mom's Dementia is? Is she mostly herself with the occasional bad spell, or has the dementia progressed  badly and these days she is more of someone that she wasn't before? \n\nI don't really think anyone is in a position to comment until we know this, because imo it depends on the severity of the Dementia.", "ESH. You should not have made jokes about something that clearly upset your partner but at the same time you're right that correcting your mother's behavior is pointless. This is a really shitty situation but hopefully they won't want to see her again?", "honestly EHS. This is a rather more tricky situation because I can see it both ways.

Their mind is broken, they are suffering. That doesn\u2019t excuse their behavior, and certainly doesn\u2019t mean anyone HAS to be okay with it. But this isn\u2019t a matter of morality, the only comparison I could make would be like punishing a child with a mental disability for rude outbursts. It\u2019s still not even a great comparison. But your partner needs to understand there is quite literally nothing you can do about it. Whatever action of defending her or reprimanding your mother would simply be a charade for their pride. I know that\u2019s harsh to say and I have a hard time saying it with something as serious as racist or homophobic comments, I\u2019m not trying to pretend as if your partner is wrong for being hurt. But the fact is you warned them, and they still chose and downright insisted on being introduced. It\u2019s usually difficult for people to actually have dementia in their face. They can be told or read about it, but the shock is still tremendous so I will cut them slack there. However they will be the AH if they continue to harp on this. You have SO MUCH on your plate and really have to focus on taking care of yourself. The last 6 years especially the last 9 months of my grandmas life with dementia was by far the most emotionally devastating, physically demanding and detrimental time in my families life. It\u2019s hard to even put into words how much work goes into to caring for someone while simultaneously grieving them before they are even gone. You are watching someone you love more than anything slip away right in front of you. One day she won\u2019t even recognize who you are, and people need to realize it goes so far beyond memory. Oftentimes dementia can turn someone into an entirely different person. A person without impulse control, possibly even violent and cruel. But you need support right now, and this simply isn\u2019t gonna fit on your plate. Arguing with someone with dementia is like arguing with a toddler, she probably doesn\u2019t even know what planet she\u2019s on right now. On top of that it will actually cause more issues and distress to argue with them to both of you. I literally sat and fed my grandmas baby doll for two hours, burped it, changed the diaper and rocked it to sleep all damn day because she was convinced it was a real baby and I wasn\u2019t taking good care of it. But it made her happy, it kept her calm and her mind engaged to just sit with me and my baby. You will do whatever it takes for a day of peace.", "NTA. I\u2019m going thru this with my partner and grandma right now. When they first met she wasn\u2019t diagnosed and was sweet as pie but now that it\u2019s progressed she is rude and has a poison tongue. Luckily he understands as his grandma also had dementia before she passed but it doesn\u2019t make it any easier.", "NTA. Your mother has dementia, which can affect her behaviour as well as her memory. Any ship of correcting her behaviour has long sailed. Your partner can choose not to visit your mother.", "NTA\nDementia sucks. I am sorry your partner doesn't understand this. Maybe there is a dementia not for profit they can go to for some educational sessions?", "I will admit the lovely aspect might be my fault cause my mom is a lovely person at the core. I think my mixed signals might have caused confusion cause when I speak of her I have nothing but positive things to say in the general sense. When I call to check up and speak with the aids just to check up via FaceTime my mom is always as happy as can be. The aids love her. \n\nI think this dynamic of people looking past the poor behavior and seeing the person for who they are  / where created a different picture.", "And in some cases, like my grandma for example it wasn\u2019t even stuck in another time. She would revert to almost a toddler, so any person that was unusual to her would cause distress. She\u2019d have these rare fleeting moments even up until the end where she\u2019d be lucid and herself. But what she was most often was an entirely different person. She could be mean, and cruel. She would do things she\u2019s never in her life done like call us names or slap us - things that were wildly of character for her.", "Her mood and personality changes are mostly trigger based. So many things alter her mood and personality. She has her moments when you would be hard pressed to know she has dementia. When she is as spark as ever. Her lucid moments are great. \n\nOthers she is like a toddler. Hard to put a number in it via a scale but let's say about a five cause it is a coin flip.\n\nThe racist and homophobic behavior is deep seeded trauma and indoctrination by my grandparents it is most likely long term memory as her doctor puts it. Correcting the behavior also makes her annoyed and visibly stressed so her care team suggested to leave non violent behavior largely uncorrected because it puts her in a loop of being on edge.\n\nEdit: Sorry misread your comment, she is currently mild to serve in terms of her dementia. \n\nIn terms of raw functionality such as completing tasks she is capable of doing it with queuing and prompting. She cannot follow multi step tasks but if you tell her to do one thing at a time she is able to complete the task without physical assistance. \n\nIn terms of cognitive ability it is middle ground. She has an understanding of place and has awareness that she is suffering from an illness. She can convey feelings, such a love, happiness, sadness, angry.\n\nShe does have moments of extreme confusion though.", "Main issue with correcting the behavior is, I can go home afterwards. The staff then has to deal with the backlash after I have left. It is not fair to the staff to alter the comfort of the resident cause it can have a domino effect. Her anxiety shoots up, then spreads to others. \n\nCorrecting the behaviors is often the worse thing you can do.", "Actually, no, she shouldn't have. This probably would have made things worse.", "It\u2019s really dangerous to argue with someone with dementia, it\u2019s can cause huge distress and major meltdowns. Their brains are literally broken, so there are a lot of lesser known little details most aren\u2019t aware of. Very often patients will dig their heels into an argument long after they\u2019ve forgotten what they are even arguing about, so now you have a person who is hostile but doesn\u2019t know why- it can cause major major meltdowns and could become violent and even needed to be sedated. It\u2019s crucial to preserve the peace and mood for their stability sake. But it\u2019s really hard to navigate an illness that literally changes who someone is, and watch them deteriorate further with no end in sight.", "I don't agree with you but i would really like to know why you think so", "Did your mom at any point insult your partner or your relationship with them? If not, is your partner upset solely over the fact that you didn't correct your mom on her homophobic/racist remarks?", "People with dementia are often not friendly to strangers at all as well. I think your friends are ignorant to a lot of these details", "Lots can\u2019t admit contradictory facts. \n\nShe is your mom, and you have a loving relationship. \nShe is sick with dementia, and will be offensive. There is no point to argue as it won\u2019t accomplish anything else than making her agitated and harder for her caretakers. \n\nIf your mom was well, could be reasoned with, sure correcting her awful behaviour will might be worth it. This isn\u2019t the case here. You can only focus on the good parts. There no indication of her mistreating you before her being sick, so there no reasons to hold her accountable for a symptom of her dementia. \n\nYour friend and partner seem to believe it\u2019s a personality feature your mom can control. They are denying your past relationship in a way. She is sick and it is a hurtful symptoms. It\u2019s doesn\u2019t means you have to stop loving her, or that she don\u2019t love you. \n\nI\u2019m kinda mad at your partner, so full of themselves they thought the were so special, than someone with dementia will change by meeting them. What did they expect anything else that what you warned them about. Really unfair to push it on you.", "I get it. My grandma had dementia. Some people just won't understand", "Nobody agrees with me, so thank you for asking. My experience with family members with dementia has been that it removes filters, and bigots out themselves. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful, or even possible to change or correct that, but I genuinely think it\u2019s important to acknowledge it. You can love her, and also love your partner enough to keep them apart. You\u2019re not a bad person, and you don\u2019t need to disown your mom. Just don\u2019t make excuses for her. I wish you the best. It\u2019s hard.", "Oh yeah, my mom went in think of every bigoted talking point my mom said it.\n\nI just nodded waited for her rant to stop then asked how she was feeling, played cards, talked about her day. The normal things we do.\n\nI do get why they are upset, I really do. My mom made targeted remarks she knows how to dig deep. Always been good at reading people, she was a therapist for over 30 years. \n\nAs I explained to her afterwards. I get to go home afterwards, they staff and residence do not. I told her i get your pain, but I have to put them above your pain in this case. It could really cause issues for everyone if I corrected her and it caused her to go into a spirl.\n\nEdit: Thinking about it I could have worded things in a more understanding way. I was a tad short with  them. I was just annoyed cause I knew this was going to happen and I let it happen, and the implied notion of she would forget anyways but would make them feel better anyways had I corrected her also triggered me slightly. Cause it showed disrespect for my, the staff, and other residents.", "I just had that passing thought, did my partner think they were the one that would be the expectation. Trying to wrap my head around what was their endgame here.", "My fault I misread your comment. Tired did not get much sleep.\n\nThank you though. You are right people just don't get it.", "A lot of people aren\u2019t going to get it, but they are going to assume they do from the little they have read or seen in movies. A lot of people just assume dementia is memory loss and reveals who someone really is, when the truth is so much worse. You have enough to deal with. I\u2019m really sorry, and if you ever need to talk or vent to someone who does get it please shoot me a message."]}
