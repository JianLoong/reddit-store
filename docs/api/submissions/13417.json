But, you and your wife suck for allowing a narcissist, not only around your child, but allowing him to watch your child.  Eventually, your kids will start picking up on his personality.  Do you really want your kids to be abused by him?  Or worse, do you really want to risk your children becoming like him?", "NTA, and this person should NOT be caring for your children. \n\nYou need to find someone else to handle that childcare once a week. As this person is not someone who should be caring for very young children, especially not when they cannot speak out to tell you if something happens when you're not there. \n\nThat was the behavior that he did *in front* of you. What do you think he's doing when you're not there?", "NTA.\nBut while they provide child care, they\u2019re always going to cross your boundaries because they view themselves as an authority figure. Which they are for one day a week. \n\nIf you continue to send your kids to this man (who are you described as being afraid of along with a host of other negative things) then you would be TA.", "NTA\n\nYou were handling the situation. He interfered and got told off. Not your problem he can't handle seeing you discipline your kid without getting in the way.", "NTA. Don't ask him for babysitting duties any more.", "NTA,  but as you pointed out,  it may have been better to not confront your FIL as you depend on him for babysitting.", "NTA. You are the parent and it is your job to protect your children, which you did. You understand his flaw of being a narcissist and the manipulative techniques he employs to get his way when he doesn\u2019t like boundaries being set. It is on him how he reacts, but it is 100% on you, now that you are aware of his mechanisms, if you cave and let him have his way, rather than hold your ground. You may seriously want to consider alternatives to your weekly child care arrangement.", "NTA you were handling the situation and you\u2019re the parent. It\u2019s a bit strange that he told you about it as if expecting you to reprimand and then interjects as soon as you started doing so. Kinda seems like he wanted to assert some kind of dominance over you in front of your children which is definitely not ok.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t leave your kids with a narcissist. Jesus", "Huge NTA. You were already handling the situation, and you are the parent to both children involved.", "NTA. You were handling it just fine, but apparently he decided there wasn't enough yelling involved. It's not your fault he doesn't know how to handle being called out on his bad behavior.", "YTA for allowing your children to be taken care of by someone that you know is emotionally abusive.", "NTA", "NTA - We are trying to gentle parent, not raise our kids the same aggressive way they raised us.", "You would be an asshole if you didn\u2019t tell him that.\n\nFirst of all, what kind of adult yells at a three-year-old. What kind of adult has so little self control over their emotions that they yell at any human being at all. Let alone someone who is three years old.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you had to deal with that. That\u2019s really stressful considering it\u2019s your father-in-law. You are not the asshole.

You and your wife can sell plasma or walk dogs or whatever to afford a qualified caregiver that one day a week.\n\nNTA for shutting him up.  Y T A for regularly leaving your kids with him for long periods.", "NTA. You did exactly the right thing. Your FIL is, like so many of them, an enraged, self-righteous bully.\n\nUnfortunately, your wife may block any attempt you make to establish boundaries, and it's absolutely necessary for parents to hold to a united front in matters such as these.\n\nYes, you will miss out on free childcare, but I dread to think how a man like your FIL would treat a small boy when your back is turned.\n\nI say go NC with FIL and MIL as well (as she'll want to join right in in the war). Remember, grandparents always miss out more than you do when war breaks out and they can't visit. Keep up the NC until FIL changes his ways.\n\nAnd that'll be never.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Have responded similarly above. We have an exit strategy.", "My thoughts exactly. I missed a lot of things when my kids were younger, because I refused to allow people like that around my kids. I didn\u2019t need a babysitter that bad, to risk that type of person being around them.", "Yes. Exactly this", "Thank you for your reassurance!", "I appreciate that perspective. I come from a large Irish family in rural Ireland and he\u2019s an Englishman from a small town family so I get that there may be slight cultural differences but it\u2019s against every grain in my dna to not let him know that I\u2019m not happy with something.", "Hi, really constructive and I totalled agree. Thanks for the reassurance", "That\u2019s what I thought as well. Thank you for your reassurance.", "I wish I could give you 100 Karma!", "Thank you that\u2019s what I felt as well.", "I respect that perspective. And I don\u2019t disagree.

Many thanks!", "Balanced feedback! Duly noted. Thank you.", "My corn is what is fil doing with your kids that one day a week. Neither can voice their fears or show them that well. \n\nYou have no idea how he's interacting with them when you two aren't around.", "My baby has never been away from me for more than 2-3 hours because I refuse to let him be around these people", "Nope. That\u2019s not how parenting works. She doesn\u2019t get to unilaterally override your concerns, which seem very valid.", "You\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m glad that you came here and got to support you needed because you shouldn\u2019t of had to be in a situation like that. I\u2019m wishing the best to you and your son.", "This!", "NTA, the child is your's and you educate him as you see fit.

It\u2019s difficult to know what\u2019s right in the moment hence why I\u2019ve turned to here. You\u2019re the pat on the back I was hoping I\u2019d get.

Do better before your kids pay the price.", "NTA for telling your FIL off but Y-T-A for using a known narcissist that shouts at your non verbal child for childcare.\n\nWhen my dad beat me when I was a child, that was his fault.
