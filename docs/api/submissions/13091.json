Perhaps it would have been better seeking reparation from the little cousin's parent, who at the end of the day should be liable for any damage their offspring has caused", "Nope, NTA. If your copy happens to be a first edition (doubtful), she owes you a first edition.", "NTA. Don't expect her to buy a new book. Also, ask yourself if a book is worth losing a friendship over.\n\nEDIT: typo", "NTA.\n\nYou trusted her with it and she broke your trust. It is her fault because she left it unattended, whether she forgot it or not. She probably also did some damage but just blamed it all on her little cousin to try and justify why she shouldn't buy you a new one.", "NTA\n\nIt was her fault that she didn't keep the book in a safe place. If you borrowed her iPad and your little cousin decided to smash it with a toy, that would be your fault. She wanted to borrow it, and it was her responsibility to keep it safe.", "NTA. Here is why I'm saying you not. As a bookworm if you give someone a book and you told them the guidelines and the break beyond that point were the book needs replacement it's the person you let borrow responsibility to replace it. From the damage you said your book needs replacement, and if the friend isn't going to accept that you neep to tell yours and their parents. They aren't a friend. My sister-in-law destroyed a book series my friend loved that was in my possession so i gave her the money to replace them. it's as simple as respecting the other person after something gets damaged in your care.", "NTA, but I'm the same way about my books so perhaps I'm biased.\n\nI do think that when you borrow something from a friend and you don't return it in the same condition, you should apologize and ask how to make things right. In your case, that would be buying a new book. Even if she's not the one who colored in it, she left it out where it could be damaged, so yes, I think it's reasonable to ask her to replace it.\n\nIf I let a friend borrow a T-shirt and their dog tore it up while it was laying on their bed, I would expect my friend to replace the T-shirt. It was damaged. They didn't do it, but they also didn't make sure to take good care of it. They're responsible.", "I love books, and I love sharing them with people.\n\nI used to \"lend\" people books. I have never gotten a book back, from anyone. Loan a book = say goodbye to the book.\n\nI stopped loaning books. For some titles that I really want to share, I'll just buy extra copies when I see one for cheap. Now I give the books away for free with a clean conscience, and my friendships stay intact.", "NTA\n\nFellow bookworm here! If someone did that to my book, ESPECIALLY Harry Potter, I would be MAD MAD. \n\nAlso, the book was her responsibility when it was given to her. This is a lesson for her. When you borrow things from someone else, it becomes your responsibility automatically to care for the said thing. Doesn't matter who colored in it, she was the one who was supposed to take care of it. \n\nIf you aren't grown up enough to take care of other people's belongings, you shouldn't borrow.", "NTA. I\u2019m a bookworm too. I wouldn\u2019t break off a friendship over a damage book if she is a good friend. She is young and she can learn but you are right to be mad and to ask for either money or a brand new book. She needs to learn that she did wrong.", "Mostly NTA. Your friend owes you either a near-mint used copy OR a new one. You didn't lend a new copy, so YTA if you insist on brand new. But it's probably easier to find new than like-new/near-mint.", "NTA she owes you a new book.

She may want to make her cousin or cousin\u2019s parents pay for the book, regardless your friend is ultimately responsible.\n\nI know you\u2019re only 15, but that\u2019s still childlike behavior crying \u201cit\u2019s not MY fault\u201d and she needs to grow up", "NTA - this comes up a ton on this sub.

And yes, you owe them an apology.\n\nLet this PSA reverberate through the minds of all and let us all make reparations for the tiny terrorists.", "NTA. People who aren't bookworms wouldn't understand. At 15 she is old enough to know right from wrong. It is her fault because she had borrowed it. She should have put it away in a safe place. Once she noticed that it had been ruined she should have boughten you a new one. Instead she just handed it to you I'd imagine while shrugging her shoulders. She's not a friend. And your mother should be more understanding towards your feelings with something that's so important to you. I'm sorry for your books destruction.", "NTA, it is her fault.  Not even sure why this is a question.  As to you overreacting, you probably are.  Unless these are collectibles of some sort, books are made for reading and are going to collect fingerprints and the occasional stain.  It's still your book and your friend did not treat it with the respect you expected, but would I write off my best friend over it?  No.", "NTA, if you borrow something from someone and it\u2019s ruined whilst in your possession whether it\u2019s \u201cyour fault\u201d or not, it\u2019s on you to replace it. And if respecting your belongings that you kindly let her borrow is worth less to her than the $10 it would cost for a new book then she\u2019s a shitty friend. And btw it was her fault", "NTA. I\u2019d be pissed as-well.", "NTA\n\nYour friend or her parents should have offered to replace it right away. She was responsible for the book, which means she's responsible for the damage.  \n\nYour mom needs to step up and back you on this.", "NTA.

It was in her possession. She was responsible for it. It doesn\u2019t matter who colored it. It was supposed to be in your former friend\u2019s care. \n\nAnd I can\u2019t believe how your mom is acting. I think your mom doesn\u2019t want to offend her mom and that\u2019s why she\u2019s making you eat the cost of the book. Ask your mom to buy you a new book, since it\u2019s just a book. Definitely NTA.\n\nI\u2019m sorry about your book.", "YTA. It's understandable that you're upset about your book being damaged, but demanding that your friend buy you a new one is excessive. Accidents happen, and your friend didn't intentionally let her cousin ruin your book. It's not fair to hold her responsible for the actions of someone else, especially when she already apologized and explained what happened. Blocking her and cutting off your friendship over a replaceable book seems like an overreaction. It would be better to have an open and honest conversation with your friend about how you feel and try to come to a solution together.", "NTA - But possible overreaction with the final block. \n\nShe accepted responsibility for your property when she borrowed it. What happened while it was under her care is her responsibility and it doesn't matter \"who did it.\" \n\nIt is reasonable for you to become upset with her. \n\nThis is especially true because she was aware you were protective of your books! You asked her to take care of it and her response was to leave it in an apparently frequented area of the house.\n\nBlocking someone over this is understandable if this is a pattern of behavior. \n\nHowever if it is the first time something like this has happened, and she is otherwise a good friend, you're taking away her chance to learn her lesson and grow. \n\nSometimes the biggest reason we fight is because our emotions are running when we start to talk. We become defensive where we normally wouldn't. You both may need a chance to calm down and explain your side of the story. Such as the fact you aren't angry but disappointed. You trusted her and it returned in poor condition. \n\nStick to your word and **do not let her borrow things** in the future.", "NTA, but don't expect your book back, however, always keep in mind this probably wont be the last tine someone like this happens.", "NTA. The book was in her care. If she feels like she shouldn't be responsible for it, then she can have her aunt/uncle pay for it. In any case, the book needs to be replaced. Don't hesitate to involve your mom if needed. This is one of those instances, where this is perfectly reasonable. Books are expensive.", "NTA, If your friend damaged your book, it is understandable that you would want them to pay for a new one. You could try discussing the situation with your friend in a calm and respectful manner, explaining how important the book is to you and why you believe they should take responsibility for damaging it. Perhaps they didn't realize the value of the book to you or the importance of taking responsibility for one's actions. If they still refuse to pay for a new book, you could suggest finding a compromise, such as splitting the cost or coming up with an alternative solution together. It's important to approach the situation with a focus on finding a resolution that is fair and respectful to both parties.", "NTA in fact this is a life lesson on not giving things to others. I know that sounds shit, but I've lent out books and never even got them back.\n\nWhether or not she physically drew on it or not, the book and the state it was in was still her responsibility. If y'all actually worked, I'd say that's fair that she buys you a new one. Unfortunately, if y'all don't work then you're basically telling her that she needs to tell her parents to give her the money. So, that makes it something that you need to talk to her parents about and see if they're willing to do that.\n\nOverall, NTA - but maybe don't lend things like books out in the future.", "NTA. Asking for her to replace the copy that was destroyed while she had it is the reasonable response. Accidents do happen, and if this had happened to me when I had a friends belongings I would replace it no questions asked.", "NTA She doesn't have to buy you a new book, but on the upside I'm pretty sure you use the scribblings in the old one to forge a legally binding contract and sell her Cousin into indentured servitude to pay for a new one. Seems like the simplest solution", "NTA.\n\nIt is her fault and she is dodging responsibility by using a technicality. You are not overreacting. It's not \"just a book\". Books are clearly important to you and your mother should know that better than anyone.\n\nHowever I wouldn't expect her to buy you a new book, you are NTA for asking but unfortunately you can't force her. Stick to your guns and don't let her borrow a book (or any of your property) again.", "NTA. You expect someone to return something to you in the same condition you lent it. That\u2019s basic respect and borrowing etiquette. \n\nDrawing and ripped pages means that book is no longer complete/readable. It is, unfortuately, basically trash at this point. It would\u2019ve been eaiser to just venmo you the cost of the book than make you use gas to get to/from her house to collect a belonging of yours that was ruined in her care.", "It was literally her fault for leaving a book out where a child had access to it.\n\nShe owes you a copy of the book.\n\nNTA", "Tell your friend that it doesn't matter who's fault is. The thing is you lend her a book, and you could do nothing to avoid what the kid did to it. It wasn't your responsibility to guard the book while it was under her care. Tell her you need her to compensate for it (another copy, the money, something) or understand that you feel angry and defenseless in that unfair situation.\n\nNTA.", "Nta. I'm not a bookworm and this is still a reasonable request. You lent it to your friend and told her not to get it dirty. When you got it back, it was ruined. She should buy a new one. If she then wants to get paid back from her cousin/ aunt/ family that's on her. \n\nIt's like you rent a car, but then your buddy comes over and hits it with a bat. You don't get to tell the rental place that it's not your fault.", "ESH\n\nShe should have offered to replace your book. But ending a friendship over a book is petty.\n\n(Also, anyone asking someone else to spend money on JK Rowling books or media is an asshole because she uses the profitability of her work as a justification of her bigotry)", "NTA\n\nYou probably aren\u2019t getting a replacement though. Never lend things, only give.", "NTA.\n\nThat excuse wouldn't fly at any library so why would she think it would fly with you.\n\nCan you imagine her going to the library with the book and saying, well, my cousin damaged it, I shouldn't have to pay for it....", "NTA but now you know not to loan anything again to your irresponsible \u2018friend\u2019. Consider this an expensive lesson.", "NTA the book was under her care she should have taken better care of where she left it.", "Yes. Any demand is an asshole move", "It is because it wouldn\u2019t end with just a book. That kind of disrespect would translate into other things.", "Yes! I was also thinking that. It's too much damage for her not to have noticed her cousin doing and then taken it away. I wouldn't be surprised if her friend is secretly jealous of her and did this to bully her.", "I concur with this. I think blocking this friend over the condition of a book is a definite overreaction if the friendship meant anything. I also understand why the friend is bothered by this as it was an accident.", "So what is OP supposed to do with a book that is missing pages?", "Accidents happen, but they're still our responsibility.\n\nIf I drive my car, my front tire blows out, and I end up colliding with someone else, do I get to escape responsibility by saying it was an accident? No, I'm still on the hook for it, and if I don't have insurance I'll be facing a very hefty bill.\n\nIf you are borrowing someone else's item, common courtesy is to make it whole if it's damaged or destroyed. It doesn't matter what the cause of the damage was - you make it right for the person whose possession was destroyed. If it wasn't you who damaged the product, you can either have them reimburse you or outright pay for the replacement themselves, but you don't make the person whose possession you destroyed wait for replacement.\n\nIn this situation - friend should absolutely replace the book for OP. She could (and should!) ask the cousin's parents to pay her back for the cost of the book, or just buy the replacement copy to begin with. But if the cousin's parents are dragging their heels, she should replace the book and not force OP to be bill collector.", "I\u2019m sorry but just because it was an \u201caccident\u201d doesn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t responsible for it. It\u2019s not fair for OP to lend her book to someone she trusts and then the borrower breaks that trust. Also, the fact that she \u201cforgot about it\u201d says a lot to me.", "How is expecting a new book excessive when a like-new book was lent?\n\nThe only acceptable alternative to new would be to scour used-book stores for another near-mint.", "It's common courtesy to return an item in the same condition. The fact it was an \"accident\" doesn't excuse the borrowers responsibility.", "I don't see anything about ending a friendship. But even if it happened, she's well within her rights. It's about more than the physical book, it's respecting other people and their property. Books are valuable to her and her friend doesn't respect that. Would you make the same comment if it was a phone, tablet, or video games console?", "Kinda fair, but you don't even think EAH?\n\nLike, demanding something from a friend is a bit of an AH move and could be handled differently but I think she still deserves a new book. If you borrow something, it then becomes your sole responsibility to keep in the condition that it is given to you. If not, you buy a new thing for the loaner.", ">I don't see anything about ending a friendship\n\nOp said she ended up blocking her friend, that's kinda ending the friendship", "Well, you're not ignoring it. You're directly addressing it by stating it's \"wrong\" and irrelevant.\n\nMaybe I'm not up to date with kids today, but blocking someone seems like it would seriously impact a friendship.", "See your point\u2026demands still suck, as it\u2019s control bs and conditional\u2026just my thoughts", "RE: JK Rowling That's fair, I shouldn't have said anything.

I think they're generally more hurtful to the person's cause than helpful.\n\nI used to do a lot of bar work & other hospitality and there's nothing like someone demanding something that would immediately make them get zero.", "Yeah, it's a fair point that OP might have blocked as a temporary cool off. I personally would assume the friendship was over if I was blocked, but there might be people who use it differently.", "NTA.

It's not your friends fault that someone else did something bad, but it is her responsibility. You're both kids, so don't be so hard on her for not understanding that she's on the hook for someone else's actions. You're NTA for rightfully expecting a new book, and your friend is NTA either, although she's wrong. Learning responsibility is a part of growing up, and it takes time. Be patient and forgiving, as best you can. \n\nAlso, where are the kids parents in this, or whatever adult was responsible at the time? As much as your friend took responsibility for the book, they should be responsible for the actions of the child, and they don't have the excuse of being kids themselves.

But I learned a good lesson about never lending anything to that friend again.\n\n(Then learned it again with a different friend in college when she returned a PS1 game in the wrong case and looking like it had been dropped on the ground and dragged underfoot. Turns out she had lent MY game to another friend of her's and was entirely unapologetic about it (she did apologize for losing the case, though, but yep. I finally replaced the game a few years ago.)\n\nGood luck, and never lend your friend anything again.", "NTA You\u2019re not overreacting IMO. It\u2019s your book and you want to keep it nice and said as much before you hesitantly loaned it to your friend. She didn\u2019t take care of it and allowed it to be ruined. She should apologize at the very least instead of being defensive, but replacing it is the correct thing to do.", "You should have a new copy.", "NTA It's proper that she replace it, as she allowed it to be destroyed.

Just how a vintage video game console goes up in value as it gets more \"vintage\"", "But if they are 15 years old, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re old enough to have a job (in the UK anyway) how would a 15 year old have the money to pay without getting it from a parent either through an allowance or asking for it .. 15 years old is old enough to understand the impact of what they have done but they are still a child and kids need adult guidance and help to put things right, teachers and parents constantly remind kids that age what is the right thing to do/say and how to act", "Also whether it was the friends book or not, the child\u2019s parents should still be responsible for replacing what their kid destroyed, it\u2019s worse that it wasn\u2019t the friends book but if it was it\u2019s still just as bad that the cousin destroyed it, it\u2019s not any more okay to destroy a family members property", "You didn't read the link so I'll just leave this here to combat that super bad-faith representation of my argument (and the phrase itself):\n\n>'As a result of capitalism, the blame for environmental damage and worker abuse has been shifted onto the consumer by implying that if you shop fast fashion, you are directly responsible for this abuse. This is not true; a consumer is not the problem for being alive in a deceitful society. It is the responsibility of large corporations to prevent a structure such as this from forming; however, when you live in a corrupt society you cannot trust those in power to do this ... 'No ethical consumption under capitalism' was meant to take the wrongful blame off of poor communities and place it onto the corporations who are truly responsible. This phrase does not mean you should indulge ... in excess'\n\nIt's centered around fast fashion as an example, so swap out 'corporations' for 'lawmakers'. Have a good one! I'm out. Still don't think a preteen's book purchase is going to do more damage to trans communities than the average nonvoting cishet.", "NTA- as a bookworm myself, I don\u2019t particularly like the idea of loaning a book to somebody else. Even with people I\u2019m close with. \nPoint is, when you borrow something from someone else (and in this case you know the loaner(?) is very protective of their belongings) you have to be careful with their things. I know accidents happen. But in this case, it was no accident. She left the book unattended with a child (most likely a toddler i think) in the house.", "NTA. If you borrow something and it gets damaged whilst in your possession, you repair or replace it. She can try and get her cousin\u2019s parents to pay for it, but regardless, it\u2019s on her to make it better.", "When you borrow something, it's your responsibility to return it in the same condition.  It doesn't matter if a meteor you definitely didn't want falling through your roof smashes the thing you borrowed and it's totally not your fault -- it is still your responsibility to return the item in the same condition or to replace it.\n\nTechnically, here, I think that whoever was supposed to be watching the kid who colored in the book should be ponying up.  But if they won't, it's on your friend.  Even if the gargoyle ate it, or an evil spirit cast a spell on it, or there was a flood that demolished her bedroom. She still owes you a new book.\n\nNTA, but your friend is.", "NTA. It was damaged while in her possession.", "Definitely NTA\nWhen I was in my mid teens (nearly 50 years ago) I let one of my friends borrow one of my special magazines. When it was returned it had coffee mug stains on the cover. I always looked after my own things, so I was so disappointed that it had been damaged that I still remember the feeling now.", "NTA The book was in her care so it was her responsibility to keep it safe end of. It's not \"just a book\" as your mother said. It was your property. Your friend ought to replace the book. If she refuses then unfortunately you'll have to chalk this up to experience and never loan anything to her again.", "NTA you're better than me I would I have forced her hand until.she handed money for a new book . Drop her she is not worth being a friend", "NTA. Why would anyone anywhere think you were? If you loan someone something and they break it, then they should pay you for replacing what they broke.", "NTA it was in her care and was ruined, therefore her fault", "Nta, don\u2019t let ur friends borrow ur books anymore !!", "Wasn\u2019t her fault but she need to paid for a new one. \nIf you break something at a store you pay for it. This is worse bc you loaned something to a friend. \n\nNTA. She needs to pay for it. Or her parent if she doesn\u2019t have the money. You should lose something bc they where irresponsible.", "NTA. The only part she's right in is that she shouldn't have to pay, because the parents of her niece should. However, she is fully responsible for giving you the replacement.\n\nWhen my kids break stuff (they're kids, sometimes they just do stupid things lol) I pay for it to be replaced. In the end it's my kid that did it. Great teaching moment to show my children that when you break things from others, you need to reimburse them for it. They're too young, so the money comes from me, but the sorry and giving the replacement is on them. Can't start teaching young enough I see from this story.", "NTA\n\nTell her there is this thing called a library.", "You lack the maturity required to be part of adult conversations."]}
