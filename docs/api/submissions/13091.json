Perhaps it would have been better seeking reparation from the little cousin's parent, who at the end of the day should be liable for any damage their offspring has caused", "Nope, NTA. If your copy happens to be a first edition (doubtful), she owes you a first edition.", "NTA. Don't expect her to buy a new book. Also, ask yourself if a book is worth losing a friendship over.\n\nEDIT: typo", "NTA.\n\nYou trusted her with it and she broke your trust. It is her fault because she left it unattended, whether she forgot it or not. She probably also did some damage but just blamed it all on her little cousin to try and justify why she shouldn't buy you a new one.", "NTA\n\nIt was her fault that she didn't keep the book in a safe place. If you borrowed her iPad and your little cousin decided to smash it with a toy, that would be your fault. She wanted to borrow it, and it was her responsibility to keep it safe.", "NTA. Here is why I'm saying you not. As a bookworm if you give someone a book and you told them the guidelines and the break beyond that point were the book needs replacement it's the person you let borrow responsibility to replace it. From the damage you said your book needs replacement, and if the friend isn't going to accept that you neep to tell yours and their parents. They aren't a friend. My sister-in-law destroyed a book series my friend loved that was in my possession so i gave her the money to replace them. it's as simple as respecting the other person after something gets damaged in your care.", "NTA, but I'm the same way about my books so perhaps I'm biased.\n\nI do think that when you borrow something from a friend and you don't return it in the same condition, you should apologize and ask how to make things right. In your case, that would be buying a new book. Even if she's not the one who colored in it, she left it out where it could be damaged, so yes, I think it's reasonable to ask her to replace it.\n\nIf I let a friend borrow a T-shirt and their dog tore it up while it was laying on their bed, I would expect my friend to replace the T-shirt. It was damaged. They didn't do it, but they also didn't make sure to take good care of it. They're responsible.", "I love books, and I love sharing them with people.\n\nI used to \"lend\" people books. I have never gotten a book back, from anyone. Loan a book = say goodbye to the book.\n\nI stopped loaning books. For some titles that I really want to share, I'll just buy extra copies when I see one for cheap. Now I give the books away for free with a clean conscience, and my friendships stay intact.", "NTA\n\nFellow bookworm here! If someone did that to my book, ESPECIALLY Harry Potter, I would be MAD MAD. \n\nAlso, the book was her responsibility when it was given to her. This is a lesson for her. When you borrow things from someone else, it becomes your responsibility automatically to care for the said thing. Doesn't matter who colored in it, she was the one who was supposed to take care of it. \n\nIf you aren't grown up enough to take care of other people's belongings, you shouldn't borrow.", "NTA. I\u2019m a bookworm too. I wouldn\u2019t break off a friendship over a damage book if she is a good friend. She is young and she can learn but you are right to be mad and to ask for either money or a brand new book. She needs to learn that she did wrong.", "Mostly NTA. Your friend owes you either a near-mint used copy OR a new one. You didn't lend a new copy, so YTA if you insist on brand new. But it's probably easier to find new than like-new/near-mint.", "NTA she owes you a new book.

She may want to make her cousin or cousin\u2019s parents pay for the book, regardless your friend is ultimately responsible.\n\nI know you\u2019re only 15, but that\u2019s still childlike behavior crying \u201cit\u2019s not MY fault\u201d and she needs to grow up", "NTA - this comes up a ton on this sub.

And yes, you owe them an apology.\n\nLet this PSA reverberate through the minds of all and let us all make reparations for the tiny terrorists.", "NTA. People who aren't bookworms wouldn't understand. At 15 she is old enough to know right from wrong. It is her fault because she had borrowed it. She should have put it away in a safe place. Once she noticed that it had been ruined she should have boughten you a new one. Instead she just handed it to you I'd imagine while shrugging her shoulders. She's not a friend. And your mother should be more understanding towards your feelings with something that's so important to you. I'm sorry for your books destruction.", "NTA, it is her fault.  Not even sure why this is a question.  As to you overreacting, you probably are.  Unless these are collectibles of some sort, books are made for reading and are going to collect fingerprints and the occasional stain.  It's still your book and your friend did not treat it with the respect you expected, but would I write off my best friend over it?  No.", "NTA, if you borrow something from someone and it\u2019s ruined whilst in your possession whether it\u2019s \u201cyour fault\u201d or not, it\u2019s on you to replace it. And if respecting your belongings that you kindly let her borrow is worth less to her than the $10 it would cost for a new book then she\u2019s a shitty friend. And btw it was her fault", "NTA. I\u2019d be pissed as-well.", "NTA\n\nYour friend or her parents should have offered to replace it right away. She was responsible for the book, which means she's responsible for the damage.  \n\nYour mom needs to step up and back you on this.", "NTA. It may not be her responsibility to ultimately pay for the book, but it is her responsibility to talk to her aunt/uncle about the damage their child did and the fact that it wasn\u2019t her book.", "I'm going to go a bit counter-hivemind on this one. I understand and generally agree with the previous comments and you are certainly NTA. You haven't done anything wrong, there is no way you are one.\n\nBut I wouldn't go as far as calling the other girl TA. You're both young. She made an honest mistake. I imagine she does not have disposable income to replace the book.\n\nIf I were you I'd just let it slide. I know we're on the internet and everything is life or death, and we flush friends down the toilet for everything. And I'm not saying you can't do that.\n\nBut think about it for a bit at least. You could just say OK, say you understand, and keep being friends. There will certainly be times when something bad happens in your life and you'll need her help - maybe at her expense, who knows.\n\nYou can get that book back one way or another in the future. It's just a book.\n\nI'd say my final verdict is NAH.", "You lent her the book. It was in her possession. She was responsible for it. It doesn\u2019t matter who colored it. It was supposed to be in your former friend\u2019s care. \n\nAnd I can\u2019t believe how your mom is acting. I think your mom doesn\u2019t want to offend her mom and that\u2019s why she\u2019s making you eat the cost of the book. Ask your mom to buy you a new book, since it\u2019s just a book. Definitely NTA.\n\nI\u2019m sorry about your book.", "YTA. It's understandable that you're upset about your book being damaged, but demanding that your friend buy you a new one is excessive. Accidents happen, and your friend didn't intentionally let her cousin ruin your book. It's not fair to hold her responsible for the actions of someone else, especially when she already apologized and explained what happened. Blocking her and cutting off your friendship over a replaceable book seems like an overreaction. It would be better to have an open and honest conversation with your friend about how you feel and try to come to a solution together.", "NTA - But possible overreaction with the final block. \n\nShe accepted responsibility for your property when she borrowed it. What happened while it was under her care is her responsibility and it doesn't matter \"who did it.\" \n\nIt is reasonable for you to become upset with her. \n\nThis is especially true because she was aware you were protective of your books! You asked her to take care of it and her response was to leave it in an apparently frequented area of the house.\n\nBlocking someone over this is understandable if this is a pattern of behavior. \n\nHowever if it is the first time something like this has happened, and she is otherwise a good friend, you're taking away her chance to learn her lesson and grow. \n\nSometimes the biggest reason we fight is because our emotions are running when we start to talk. We become defensive where we normally wouldn't. You both may need a chance to calm down and explain your side of the story. Such as the fact you aren't angry but disappointed. You trusted her and it returned in poor condition. \n\nStick to your word and **do not let her borrow things** in the future.", "NTA, but don't expect your book back, however, always keep in mind this probably wont be the last tine someone like this happens.", "NTA. The book was in her care. If she feels like she shouldn't be responsible for it, then she can have her aunt/uncle pay for it. In any case, the book needs to be replaced. Don't hesitate to involve your mom if needed. This is one of those instances, where this is perfectly reasonable. Books are expensive.", "NTA, If your friend damaged your book, it is understandable that you would want them to pay for a new one. You could try discussing the situation with your friend in a calm and respectful manner, explaining how important the book is to you and why you believe they should take responsibility for damaging it. Perhaps they didn't realize the value of the book to you or the importance of taking responsibility for one's actions. If they still refuse to pay for a new book, you could suggest finding a compromise, such as splitting the cost or coming up with an alternative solution together. It's important to approach the situation with a focus on finding a resolution that is fair and respectful to both parties.", "NTA in fact this is a life lesson on not giving things to others. I know that sounds shit, but I've lent out books and never even got them back.\n\nWhether or not she physically drew on it or not, the book and the state it was in was still her responsibility. If y'all actually worked, I'd say that's fair that she buys you a new one. Unfortunately, if y'all don't work then you're basically telling her that she needs to tell her parents to give her the money. So, that makes it something that you need to talk to her parents about and see if they're willing to do that.\n\nOverall, NTA - but maybe don't lend things like books out in the future.", "NTA. Asking for her to replace the copy that was destroyed while she had it is the reasonable response. Accidents do happen, and if this had happened to me when I had a friends belongings I would replace it no questions asked.", "NTA She doesn't have to buy you a new book, but on the upside I'm pretty sure you use the scribblings in the old one to forge a legally binding contract and sell her Cousin into indentured servitude to pay for a new one. Seems like the simplest solution", "NTA.\n\nIt is her fault and she is dodging responsibility by using a technicality. You are not overreacting. It's not \"just a book\". Books are clearly important to you and your mother should know that better than anyone.\n\nHowever I wouldn't expect her to buy you a new book, you are NTA for asking but unfortunately you can't force her. Stick to your guns and don't let her borrow a book (or any of your property) again.", "NTA. You expect someone to return something to you in the same condition you lent it. That\u2019s basic respect and borrowing etiquette. \n\nDrawing and ripped pages means that book is no longer complete/readable. It is, unfortuately, basically trash at this point. It would\u2019ve been eaiser to just venmo you the cost of the book than make you use gas to get to/from her house to collect a belonging of yours that was ruined in her care.", "It was literally her fault for leaving a book out where a child had access to it.\n\nShe owes you a copy of the book.\n\nNTA", "Tell your friend that it doesn't matter who's fault is. The thing is you lend her a book, and you could do nothing to avoid what the kid did to it. It wasn't your responsibility to guard the book while it was under her care. Tell her you need her to compensate for it (another copy, the money, something) or understand that you feel angry and defenseless in that unfair situation.\n\nNTA.", "Nta. I'm not a bookworm and this is still a reasonable request. You lent it to your friend and told her not to get it dirty. When you got it back, it was ruined. She should buy a new one. If she then wants to get paid back from her cousin/ aunt/ family that's on her. \n\nIt's like you rent a car, but then your buddy comes over and hits it with a bat. You don't get to tell the rental place that it's not your fault.", "ESH\n\nShe should have offered to replace your book. But ending a friendship over a book is petty.\n\n(Also, anyone asking someone else to spend money on JK Rowling books or media is an asshole because she uses the profitability of her work as a justification of her bigotry)", "NTA\n\nYou probably aren\u2019t getting a replacement though. Never lend things, only give.", "NTA.\n\nThat excuse wouldn't fly at any library so why would she think it would fly with you.\n\nCan you imagine her going to the library with the book and saying, well, my cousin damaged it, I shouldn't have to pay for it....", "NTA but now you know not to loan anything again to your irresponsible \u2018friend\u2019. Consider this an expensive lesson.", "NTA the book was under her care she should have taken better care of where she left it.", "Yes. Any demand is an asshole move", "It is because it wouldn\u2019t end with just a book. That kind of disrespect would translate into other things.", "Yes! I was also thinking that. It's too much damage for her not to have noticed her cousin doing and then taken it away. I wouldn't be surprised if her friend is secretly jealous of her and did this to bully her.", "I concur with this. I think blocking this friend over the condition of a book is a definite overreaction if the friendship meant anything. I also understand why the friend is bothered by this as it was an accident.", "So what is OP supposed to do with a book that is missing pages?", "Accidents happen, but they're still our responsibility.\n\nIf I drive my car, my front tire blows out, and I end up colliding with someone else, do I get to escape responsibility by saying it was an accident? No, I'm still on the hook for it, and if I don't have insurance I'll be facing a very hefty bill.\n\nIf you are borrowing someone else's item, common courtesy is to make it whole if it's damaged or destroyed. It doesn't matter what the cause of the damage was - you make it right for the person whose possession was destroyed. If it wasn't you who damaged the product, you can either have them reimburse you or outright pay for the replacement themselves, but you don't make the person whose possession you destroyed wait for replacement.\n\nIn this situation - friend should absolutely replace the book for OP. She could (and should!) ask the cousin's parents to pay her back for the cost of the book, or just buy the replacement copy to begin with. But if the cousin's parents are dragging their heels, she should replace the book and not force OP to be bill collector.", "I\u2019m sorry but just because it was an \u201caccident\u201d doesn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t responsible for it. It\u2019s not fair for OP to lend her book to someone she trusts and then the borrower breaks that trust. Also, the fact that she \u201cforgot about it\u201d says a lot to me.", "How is expecting a new book excessive when a like-new book was lent?\n\nThe only acceptable alternative to new would be to scour used-book stores for another near-mint.", "It's common courtesy to return an item in the same condition. The fact it was an \"accident\" doesn't excuse the borrowers responsibility.", "I don't see anything about ending a friendship. But even if it happened, she's well within her rights. It's about more than the physical book, it's respecting other people and their property. Books are valuable to her and her friend doesn't respect that. Would you make the same comment if it was a phone, tablet, or video games console?", "Kinda fair, but you don't even think EAH?\n\nLike, demanding something from a friend is a bit of an AH move and could be handled differently but I think she still deserves a new book. If you borrow something, it then becomes your sole responsibility to keep in the condition that it is given to you. If not, you buy a new thing for the loaner.", ">I don't see anything about ending a friendship\n\nOp said she ended up blocking her friend, that's kinda ending the friendship", "Well, you're not ignoring it. You're directly addressing it by stating it's \"wrong\" and irrelevant.\n\nMaybe I'm not up to date with kids today, but blocking someone seems like it would seriously impact a friendship.", "See your point\u2026demands still suck, as it\u2019s control bs and conditional\u2026just my thoughts", "RE: JK Rowling That's fair, I shouldn't have said anything. I got a little heated. I apologise.

I think they're generally more hurtful to the person's cause than helpful.\n\nI used to do a lot of bar work & other hospitality and there's nothing like someone demanding something that would immediately make them get zero.", "Yeah, it's a fair point that OP might have blocked as a temporary cool off. I personally would assume the friendship was over if I was blocked, but there might be people who use it differently.", "NTA. She is responsible for ensuring the property is taken care of while in her care. Seriously, your \"friend\" has issues. She should replace it.", "NTA.

It's not your friends fault that someone else did something bad, but it is her responsibility. You're both kids, so don't be so hard on her for not understanding that she's on the hook for someone else's actions. You're NTA for rightfully expecting a new book, and your friend is NTA either, although she's wrong. Learning responsibility is a part of growing up, and it takes time. Be patient and forgiving, as best you can. \n\nAlso, where are the kids parents in this, or whatever adult was responsible at the time? As much as your friend took responsibility for the book, they should be responsible for the actions of the child, and they don't have the excuse of being kids themselves.

I've replaced every one", "NTA.\n\nmy mom lent one of the Harry Potter books to my childhood friend when we were kids, and she lost the paper slip cover to the book and both her and her mom lied about it when my mom called them out on losing the paper slip cover. my friend also confessed to my mom she was reading it in the bathtub and while eating and my mom got mad and told them they weren't allowed to borrow our books anymore if they can't take care of them. if she had done anymore physical damage to the book, i know my mom would've asked them to replace the book too. \n\ndon't think that you're overreacting. i'd be in the same boat as you. these books probably mean a lot to you and i'm sure it's quite bothersome your friend is acting as if this isn't her responsibility to fix.", "NTA. It doesn't matter if she did it. The book was under her care and she should have done a better job to protect it, but instead it got ruined. She should definitely buy you a new one.

Nobody will ever respect it as much as you do.", "NTA. I had something similar happen with a special ordered manga (imported from Japan in about 1999, so much harder back in those days) around the same age, and that friend never replaced it either (instead of cousin, it was her bird, and well.) Sadly, mine was not easily replaceable, and I wrote it off. But I learned a good lesson about never lending anything to that friend again.\n\n(Then learned it again with a different friend in college when she returned a PS1 game in the wrong case and looking like it had been dropped on the ground and dragged underfoot. Turns out she had lent MY game to another friend of her's and was entirely unapologetic about it (she did apologize for losing the case, though, but yep. I finally replaced the game a few years ago.)\n\nGood luck, and never lend your friend anything again.", "NTA You\u2019re not overreacting IMO. It\u2019s your book and you want to keep it nice and said as much before you hesitantly loaned it to your friend. She didn\u2019t take care of it and allowed it to be ruined. She should apologize at the very least instead of being defensive, but replacing it is the correct thing to do.", "You should have a new copy.", "NTA It's proper that she replace it, as she allowed it to be destroyed. She can ask her cousins parent to reimburse her as well, but she still needs to make it right for you.", "NTA\n\nIf she had borrowed it from the library they would have asked for compensation for the destroyed book.\n\nDid you take the book back?", "NTA \n\nShe may not have been the one ruining it, but she was responsible for returning the book in same condition she borrowed it. If she doesn\u2019t buy you a new one you should end the friendship, what kind of friend would treat a friend like that", "Lending items is like lending money don\u2019t do it unless your willing to lose it. Now you have to ask yourself is it worth throwing away the relationship. NTA", "NTA.\n\nThe general rule is that if someone borrows something, they need to return it in the same condition.  Your friend was careless with your book, which caused it to get damaged (yes, that IS her fault), and she should buy you a new one.", "My friend did this to my yearbook I saved up my own money for in high school and I remember how hurt I felt. NTA.", "NTA it is her fault because she didn't protect the book. This is why I don't lend books that I care about out to anyone. If she does not replace the book then just look at it as a lesson learned and you will know to never do this again.", "NTA i will respond with what was said to me the very last time I tried to use the \"It wasnt my fault\" excuse (it absolutley was by the way. This was a long time ago). They responded \"Was it mine?\"\n\nI grew up a little that day.", "NTA. It was her responsibility to care for the book she borrowed from you.", "NTA", "NTA. In 5th grade I borrowed Order of the Phoenix from my friend, brought it back to her in my backpack and whoops! Maple syrup leaked out of my lunch kit and got all over it. Spent 3 and a half hours soaking, washing and flattening the pages so they wouldn't stain/stick together. Friend said it looked brand new afterwards. STILL offered to buy a new one. Your friend sucks", "NTA. When she borrowed the book, it became her responsibility. It is her fault that her cousin colored in it because she left it unattended, in the open, for anyone to access. If this were me, I'd be asking them to replace the whole box set (because my copies are from a special edition box set) and then let them keep the box set of the one that got ruined.", "NTA. You are not overreacting. You allowed her to borrow the book and told her that if it was damaged, you'd be upset. The book was damaged while in her care. She shouldn't have to be told to replace it. Stop lending out books. Either give them away or don't let anyone use them. No one else will care about your books the way you do. Send her the link to a used replacement, in good condition. If she doesn't buy it, drop the whole relationship.", "I lent my friend my heating pad for her back pain. It's a really fancy one with a timer and it wraps around your neck and shoulders. So not cheap. Her puppy chewed the cord and she replaced it for me before I even knew it had gotten ruined. When you borrow someone's property you take responsibility for that property. My friend didn't ruin it her dog did, so she replaced it because it was the right thing to do. NTA. You're young and you learned the hard way not expect yourself out of others. She did you a favor by showing you her true colors.", "NTA\nLet\u2019s say this was a library book. Would she not be fined if she returned it in that state? Even if it wasn\u2019t her fault the book was damaged in her possession. She needs to get you a new copy or maybe some money to get a new one. Is it possible for you to talk to either your parents or her parents about this? That might be a smart move if she refuses", "Two good lessons here: \n\n1) Only lend what you\u2019re willing to lose. \n\n2) the value of friendship. Is $25 worth the friendship? It\u2019s ok to be angry and ask for a replacement, and I do believe she owes you one. But, good friends are hard to find. She made a mistake, and as 15 year olds you\u2019re both learning to navigate life. You have the option of escalating, blocking and holding a grudge or talking it out and remaining friends.", "Is this a stolen story bc I've seen this before. Word for word.", "NTA\nShe cannot return something she borrowed in the same condition it was when she borrowed it therefore she must replace it. It doesn\u2019t matter how it got ruined - it was in her care and she did not take care of it when it was her responsibility to do so. All adults know this and in addition everyone knows that people who don't follow this normal behaviour are essentially not to be trusted so i\u2019m kind of surprised at your mother thinking you should just let it go.", "NTA.. Huge bookworm here and so is my roommate. I even work in a bookstore. We have an agreement-we can borrow each other\u2019s books we just have to return them in the condition they were loaned in. If it gets damaged we replace it.", "NTA. The book was in her possession and her responsibility. It does not matter if it was not her that damaged it. This is not normal wear and tear.", "NTA.\n\nShe knew how you felt about your book getting dirty, and she went beyond that and returned a book that was dirty and damaged with ripped out pages. It may have been an accident, but the move of a friend who cares about you and your things would've been to replace it without being asked, or at least talk to you about it.\n\nAnecdotally, I borrowed one of the Wheel of Time books from a friend which are all THICK books. It fell off my desk at work - total accident - and because of the size, the binding split and tore the back cover. I immediately bought a new one and while my friend assured me she didn't mind, it was the right thing to do because I respect her and her belongings. Your friend sounds like they have a little growing up to do.", "NTA She may not have defaced your book, but the book was her responsibility until she gave it back to you.", "I feel exactly the same way about my books. If I hand it to you in a certain condition, I expected back in that condition.", "All of my Harry Potter books are first editions, so I\u2019d be pretty angry if that happened. I guess it depends on how you see books. In my family, books are sacred.", "NTA\n\nMy dad is currently using my car for work purposes, because I don't use it, and he carries a lot of tools and his car needed replacing.\n\nIf he left the car unlocked and it got stolen, he wouldn't say \"well, It's not my fault that someone got in and drove off, I wasn't even there\"\n\n\"Just a book\" is outrageous, do people get to go to someones house and trash things, if they don't reach some arbitrary level of value? Of course not.\n\nYou are NTA, you should be bought a replacement copy.", "NTA she was responsible for the book and she was irresponsible. At the very least her cousin's parents should buy you a new book and it up to your friend to make that happen.", "Yes you have to say yes its not your fault but you are responsible for replacing the book as you were to not damage my copy.", "Jumping on the top comment so OP sees it \n\nI agree NTA, but as you are 15, I would expect the cousins parents to pay for a new book, she needs to let her parents and cousins parents know the situation, yes she is responsible and she should have kept it safe but it\u2019s also the parents responsibility to make sure their kids don\u2019t destroy other peoples property and rectify the situation if it does happen! \n\nAs a parent if my son destroyed something, especially if it was as a cousins friends property, I would pay for the new book and be really apologetic", "I agree with this, but honestly it doesn\u2019t even matter if your a bookworm or not. I feel like it\u2019s not that hard to understand the concept that when you borrow someone belongings and they get damaged in your care, you replace them. Whether it\u2019s books, clothing, equipment, etc. It\u2019s just common courtesy.\n\nDefinitely NTA.", "Nah I'm  not a bookworm and I totally understand (I mean I do enjoy reading but I'm not a collector). This is part of a collected series and was irreparably damaged. Borrower needs to pay to replace. Whether borrower then has aunt pay or whatever is her journey but it was in her care and she's ultimately responsible. You don't borrow someone's items and not return in the same condition. NTA op, I'd be livid if I lent someone something and it was returned damaged like that", "This. \n\nI always get multiple copies of books I know a friend will enjoy because Book Lending=Goodbye Book (source: experience)\n\nThey can either read with me at my place or get given one of my extras, but that's about it.\n\nETA: I do personally think she should replace it for the sole fact you asked her not to get it dirty and it was literally destroyed. If it was just a little dirt I would have stuck with the 'no more borrow' and left it at that, but something that didn't belong to her was ruined, and can't be used anymore, under her watch, so it is her responsibility (of she wants to be responsible) to replace it.\n\nBtw abebooks and thriftbooks are great sites to get cheap/used books. That's where I stock up on extras I enjoy.", "Echoing this! I am very protective of my books and know I will be bummed if somebody doesn\u2019t return them or returns them in poor condition. My solution is to just tell people that I\u2019m really particular so I don\u2019t like to lend books. My counterbalance is that if I recommend a book to someone I try to either *give* them my copy outright if I know I am not going to read it again or buy a copy for them as a gift. $10 on Amazon, friendship saved. I know that\u2019s not viable for everybody but for me it\u2019s worked.", "Happy cake day!", "Pages were ripped out!! How long was this kid left alone with it to mange to color on it and get food inside it, too? I\u2019m pissed on OP\u2019s behalf.", "Her friend refused the accept responsibility for the damage while it was in her care. This bothers me more than her carelessness and I don\u2019t know if I would want to be friends with someone like that.", "...A 15 year old reader isn't single-handedly responsible for funding JK Rowling's bigotry, she just wants to get a book that she values replaced. Please go touch grass", "I get it was an accident, but you don't think the friend being completely unapologetic and deferring blame is an issue? Maybe the book isn't worth ending a friendship over, but why be friends with someone who doesn't care about your feelings or your possessions when in their care, refuses to take responsibility, and can't own up to their mistakes?", "It was the friend's actions that let the cousin do that.", "Might\u2019ve been my first post that got removed because of the title", "The friend should collect from the cousin\u2019s parents then. But she should pay OP first and get reimbursed. The book was her responsibility.", "Yes, not hard to understand.  Ment it mostly to those saying she was going to far \"because of a book.\"", "Definitely.  Sorry ment it more towards the people who were saying she was exaggerating.", "Happy cake day!", "What disrespect though? I think OP is NTA , but I also don't think that her friend did anything disrespectful by leaving a copy of a book out while her little cousin was over. Yes she should be held responsible for her little cousin damaging it, but is leaving a book on a table indicative of her being a shitty friend? I think OP is a bit absurd to ask why she would leave a book \"unattended with kids present\". It's a fucking book, and while I love my books and don't like to lend them out on principle, I would never think someone is being disrespectful to leave a book on a table, where they usually are if they're not on a bookshelf. Calling this super irresponsible is ridiculous. Leaving your collection of super sharp knives laying on the floor with children around is super irresponsible. Having a book not under lock and key while children are visiting is absolutely normal. She could have been a bit more careful knowing that OP had made it clear how important it was, but acting like she gave a child a loaded gun is completely over dramatic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: just occurred to me you probably mean her refusal to accept responsibility. in which case: fair enough.", "If someone is super protective about certain things  those things shouldn't be lent to others. In this case OP loves her books, maybe she should think about not lending them to anyone.", "Nobody stated she was single-handedly responsible. \n\nIf you're dismissing the impact anti-trans violence and legislation is having on the lives of trans people, you should go touch grass. This is a real issue. People are dying. Health care is being made illegal. This isn't a \"touch grass\" concern.", "I changed my mind. The friend deserves nothing less than death.", "I mean, if you posted this a few weeks ago from a different acct, sure. For now I'm calling troll on this one.", "Yes absolutely! Assuming the 15 year old has the money (or they should get it from their parents in order to give it to OP before getting it back from the cousins parents) either way OP should either be given a new copy of the book or get the money for it", "Ahhhh gotcha", "Ah yeah, they're not thinking of the whole concept of you borrow it you give it back in better or same shape. I borrowed a friends portable ac when we had none and still haven't returned it because 1)her central is working and 2)I'm buying her a new one because I've used it a lot and she shouldn't get less use out of it than me. So even though she's insisted it's all good and I can just give it back when she needs it, I'm giving her a brand new one before the next time it gets hot in case her ac breaks down.", "Lol, that is what I am talking about. I\u2019m super protective of my books. I rarely lend them out and I rarely borrow things from friends but when I do if they get damaged they are my responsibility. The friend did nothing wrong but it got damaged in her care.", "Even if friend didn\u2019t notice the cousin until pages had been torn out, scribbled on and food spilled to stop her from doing even more damage, the first thing she said to OP should have been: \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d and an offer to replace it", "Lmao okay?? I didn\u2019t steal anything but you don\u2019t have to believe me \ud83d\ude02", "Friends like you both are hard to find. It's great to have someone like that.", "Okay.", "Definitely lucky to have a friend like her, we've been friends for 30 years. I don't have a \"friend group\" like some people do, I've got the few select friends from way back that are basically family."]}
