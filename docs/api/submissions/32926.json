{"id": 32926, "submission_id": "18gw6dy", "title": "WIBTA for not providing dessert for 1 kid", "selftext": "I (41f) am a school Cafeteria worker. I work in a small rural  grade K-6 school. It would be generous to say we have 100 students. \n\nThe principal wanted to offer a holiday meal for the students. I was notified we have 5 vegetarian kids, and 1 gluten free kid. I tried to be as inclusive as possible with the ingredients I have on hand to the student's food needs. I had turkey, potatos, peas, carrots, and vegan gluten free gravy. For dessert I had regular gingerbread cookies. \n\nUsually I would make both regular and gluten free cookies but the couple weeks leading up to the dinner were plaged by storms/power outages/school closures. It's just me in the kitchen and I worked double time trying to accomplish everything by the scheduled dinner day on top of my regular cafeteria cooking.\n\nThe thought and time slipped past me when it came to the gluten free cookies. I apologized to the student (age 11), and although disappointed, he seemed understanding, or so it seemed.\n\nThe next day the Mom came to the cafeteria to confront me about purposely excluding her child from dessert. Again, I apologized. I explained the entire meal was gluten free so it wasn't like there was no food available. She stated I should have offered him an alternative dessert like the frozen yogurts or popsicles we sell during recess. I disagreed, saying that the children who do not like gingerbread didn't get an option of another dessert. I was not prepared to have those options for all the kids, so sadly it couldn't be an option to him. \n\nI told her I had intended to have a gluten free cookie but sadly didn't get a chance to make them due to the power outages/school closures. She told me I should consider working harder. I told her I was sorry my best wasn't good enough for her. She told me I was not considerate or inclusive enough and I had a vendetta against her kid. At this point I had enough of her and could not hold my diplomacy and told her to get out of the cafeteria. She stormed off to the office and filed a formal complaint. She also took the school Facebook group to complain, and several parents seem to be agreeing with her, which honestly enrages me. \n\nI don't feel like I'm the asshole here. I tried to be inclusive and have something for everyone. I would love to accommodate every food whim of every kid in the school but that would be impossible. I'm considering refusing to do a holiday dinner next year because of this.

Kids understand the difference between not liking something and having a medical reason they can't have it. Having substitutions for the students with dietary restrictions and not making those substitutions available for everyone is completely standard protocol. YTA, you should've given him a yogurt or popsicle.", "NTA for making a honest mistake in a stressful situation.\n\nOP would be TA if she actually tried to fence off a food allergy as \"just a whim\". But the post does not tell that story to me and for everyone in doubt the comments should make it clear she does not.\n\nLet's look at it this way: the school offers cafeteria services to keep the parents happy while keeping costs low to keep the board happy. OP's employer accepts school's business with intent to make maximum profit. Business as usual, right?  \nNow, OP is expected to go above and beyond to make everyone happy, bring in profit and take full blame and shame for any and all mistakes. Why? Because she is graciously allowed to work there. Let me guess: at minimum wage perhaps?\n\nIf the school or parents want/need a higher grade of care for the children then maybe they should be putting in the effort/money to improve conditions. Instead of getting worked up because one kid out of 100 or so did not have their dietary requirements met *for dessert*.\n\nAnd, OP, seriously, I would be looking for another way to get that minimum wage. Somewhere you are not left alone with the burden of making sure that this one kid doesn't get seriously hurt by choosing the wrong dessert while being surrounded by 99 other kids being kids.\n\nSo, again: OP is NTA. Every other adult involved with any power to improve conditions royally sucks.", "Look if you are on your own things slip through I highly doubt that you are highly paid at your job(not that your job is not to say the least important).

The mother was reasonable, your excuse and fake apology were irrelevant, because you didn't own your responsibility. You made an error and made a child pay for it.\n\nPlease grow up. It looks like you may have targeted the child. You said you did your best. FYI, you didn't.

If so, you have to have an available option for him that is equal to a typical meal. Second, how did the parent make it back to the cafeteria to begin with? Third, are you and your company unaware of student dietary restrictions? It seems odd that the principal would request this and then tell you about dietary restrictions at that time versus having that information at the beginning of the school year so you can properly prepare food for kids.\n\nI saw in a comment that you work for a different company but are housed in the school. If this is in the US and you are in a public school, a lot of the things that happen in your story and in the comments shouldn\u2019t be happening. There are a lot of missteps between your principal and you throughout where you would help yourself by saying \u201cno\u201d in the future to requests with unreasonable time lines and budget restrictions. If it\u2019s a private school our outside of US, I have no expertise. \n\nAt this time I\u2019m going with ESH. You made a mistake and that sucks, but you have to own it.

She is ONE employee running the cafeteria for every single kid in a rural (likely under funded) school. She had to put in hours of overtime to make an extra special Christmas meal with the very limited resources she had on hand. You want her to make one serving of a speciality dessert? Or use her own money to go to the store to buy an overpriced gluten free dessert for a child that isn\u2019t hers? If your child is severely gluten free, most parents would be sending alternative treats for them, not even risk allowing them to eat a dessert made in a non-gluten free environment. Or you want her to select a different dessert to give the child that the school sells? How do you think her boss would like that? There were extreme circumstances (power outages/closures) that prevented her from making a single cookie.

It's very kind that you purchase the GF ingredients for him out of pocket. It's a shame you have to do that and the school doesn't provide it.\n\nI think the mom was right that he should have been offered an alternative. You should have offered him a popsicle or yogurt. It's fine if the other kids saw and were jealous. Alternatively, you could have done something like jello or pudding for the whole school. \n\nI don't think this was AH behavior. I think it was a genuine oversight.", "Dear Reddit: if you\u2019re saying YTA to a public school cafeteria worker doing their best to make a holiday meal that necessitated juggling a lot of food considerations, very difficult working conditions  a AND spending her own money, while forgetting to provide a kid one damn cookie, you need to actually live a real life for 5 minutes. The mob here is gruesome.\n\nOP is NTA, but all of you trying to make them feel guilty for a very small slip up absolutely are.

I recommend going with a gluten free and vegan gingerbread cookie next time (as a single option) so that everyone can partake in the dessert as there are some great recipes.", "NTA Frankly schools don't pay their employees enough to bust their asses like you did. Power outages are out of your control. Also what if there weren't alternative desserts on hand. Maybe you could have handled the confrontation better but you did the best you could with the resources available.", "YTA.\n\nMy four year old daughter has celiac disease and this is my biggest fear. No child wants or deserves to be left out. At minimum you could have had the school contact the parents to let them know that you were unable to provide a gluten free option for their child so that perhaps they could bring one in for them. Instead you said and did nothing and made a kid who probably already feels isolated from their food restrictions even more isolated. You said you couldn\u2019t provide an alternative because it wasn\u2019t available to the other kids so instead you let this kid have nothing while the other kids had something. I would have complained to the school as well.", "I would not make a holiday meal next year.  It's obvious that with only one person it is not really feasible.

Sometimes it is difficult to accommodate everyone.", "You are NTA. It was a legit mistake.

The mom went way over board and is def an AH. And to be honest if your shit is going to be jumped over this I would not cook next year. You were not being malicious or anything, you were being human. My only suggestion is to find a decent GF cookie/snack to give the child. And say hey, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t get you sorted at the time, but I do care about your needs. Here is a cookie/snack whatever. And if people are still jumping your shit tell them to go kick rocks.

You should have given him an alternative. The mom was right.", "YTA\n\nIt's understandable that you did not make a batch just for him, but the mom is right: you should have offered him an alternative you had on hand instead of excluding him.  Depending on where you work and if this is a public school you may have been required to.\n\nA child needing an accommodation because they cannot eat the dessert provided is different than a child turning down a dessert because they do not like it.  You know that.  Everyone knows that.  You could have accommodated only the child with the medical need for an alternative snack without offering it to any of the other children unless they too had a documented medical need for an alternative snack.  You just didn't, and then you doubled down when called out instead of apologizing and making a note to do better in the future.", "NTA. You meant well but things went wrong. No Cookie for kid. Imagine the hoohah if you'd given him a popsicle or whatever and other kids wanted that too - some already having had their cookies - chaos, tears...\nAnd the mom who made such a huge stank OVER A #%$M COOKIE! should have been shown the door by schoool head.

My understanding is that an overworked, underpaid part-time cafeteria worker was asked to provide a free healthy holiday meal for 100 children.

I work in a small rural  grade K-6 school. It would be generous to say we have 100 students. \n\nThe principal wanted to offer a holiday meal for the students. I was notified we have 5 vegetarian kids, and 1 gluten free kid. I tried to be as inclusive as possible with the ingredients I have on hand to the student's food needs. I had turkey, potatos, peas, carrots, and vegan gluten free gravy. For dessert I had regular gingerbread cookies. \n\nUsually I would make both regular and gluten free cookies but the couple weeks leading up to the dinner were plaged by storms/power outages/school closures. It's just me in the kitchen and I worked double time trying to accomplish everything by the scheduled dinner day on top of my regular cafeteria cooking.\n\nThe thought and time slipped past me when it came to the gluten free cookies. I apologized to the student (age 11), and although disappointed, he seemed understanding, or so it seemed.\n\nThe next day the Mom came to the cafeteria to confront me about purposely excluding her child from dessert. Again, I apologized. I explained the entire meal was gluten free so it wasn't like there was no food available. She stated I should have offered him an alternative dessert like the frozen yogurts or popsicles we sell during recess. I disagreed, saying that the children who do not like gingerbread didn't get an option of another dessert. I was not prepared to have those options for all the kids, so sadly it couldn't be an option to him. \n\nI told her I had intended to have a gluten free cookie but sadly didn't get a chance to make them due to the power outages/school closures. She told me I should consider working harder. I told her I was sorry my best wasn't good enough for her. She told me I was not considerate or inclusive enough and I had a vendetta against her kid. At this point I had enough of her and could not hold my diplomacy and told her to get out of the cafeteria. She stormed off to the office and filed a formal complaint. She also took the school Facebook group to complain, and several parents seem to be agreeing with her, which honestly enrages me. \n\nI don't feel like I'm the asshole here. I tried to be inclusive and have something for everyone. I would love to accommodate every food whim of every kid in the school but that would be impossible. I'm considering refusing to do a holiday dinner next year because of this. What do ya'll think?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I was already taking issue for using a bs argument to cover the fact that you lacked the imagination or generosity of spirit that would have had you walk aaaall the way to the freezer to get a frozen yogurt. Yeah, YTA on this one.", "NTA and I can\u2019t believe all the Y T As in here. This is insane. \n\nI have an eating disorder and can\u2019t eat the majority of foods. Even if I were still in school, I would never demand to be catered to specifically. I don\u2019t do it at family gatherings either. \n\nOthers are throwing a fit about your logic of \u201cthe kids that don\u2019t like gingerbread cookies didn\u2019t have an alternative either\u201d, and I agree completely. I was \u201cleft out\u201d as a lot of stuff as a kid that was a picky eater and sure it sucked a little bit but I never needed anything specific. If I didn\u2019t eat it, I just didn\u2019t eat it. It\u2019s not the end of the world.", "YTA. You failed to have everything on hand so giving the child a popsicle or frozen treat would have been the right thing to do. They weren\u2019t refusing the dessert you made, they have a food allergy. Why are you treating them like they were refusing the dessert? The kids mom was right, and you just made a bad excuse.", "NTA my 12 year old would understand and keep the line moving.. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s had to skip out because of dietary restrictions. That\u2019s life. Sometimes there\u2019s a cookie for you sometimes there isn\u2019t. He wasn\u2019t ostracized or ridiculed. He\u2019s going to have to face this disappointment many times in his life if he\u2019s got a real gluten allergy.", "NTA - I am not going to say YTA because I think you were overwhelmed with the task assigned to you.\n\nI am just breaking this down for my own clarity.\n\nYour Principal wanted to offer a holiday meal for approximately 100 kids. 6 of those kids have dietary needs that you needed to take care of.\n\nI don't know what budget you had to work with but you had big task with no help and the power outages definitely made things more difficult for you.\n\nHowever, a holiday meal should be inclusive of everyone. There was nothing for the vegetarians/vegans part from peas and carrots and the GF kid could have been given a popsicle - there was no real reason he couldn't have had one to be fair.", "YTA. The power outages & storms didn\u2019t prevent you from making several batches regular gingerbread cookies, so how it stop you making a single batch of GF cookies?", "NTA. \n\nA menu should be provided. If a child can\u2019t or won\u2019t eat it, they bring their own.  This kid missed one cookie. \ud83d\ude44", "Not to mention they didn't provide a main dish to the vegetarians at all. They got to eat potatoes, peas, and carrots for lunch.", "I agree YTA OP\n\nHowever I base that in the one comment \u201cthe accommodate every food whim\u201d. Being GF is not a whim for most they have severe pain and issues when eating it. \n\nA dessert could have been offered to this child but others that don\u2019t like gingerbread would want it. The others are not allergic and do not require it. This child did. I get you are busy and it\u2019s a lot of work for one freaking cookie\u2026.why not just buy one from a GF bakery or store bought? You singled out the kid as being different and that sucks if you are that kid. Regardless that the child had enough manners to not be a Jack ass about it. He left that role for you to fill OP.", "And honestly even if another kid didn\u2019t like gingerbread and wanted a yogurt instead, who cares? If OP cared that much just say no, but it\u2019s also fine to give a kid a dessert they like if it\u2019s available.", "This is exactly what I was thinking.", "I make a whopping $ 15.88, a few cents more than minimum wage for my area. Because this is suppose to be a part time job I'm technically not allowed to exceed 20 hours a week.  \nI don't work for the school board. Our cafeteria service is an outside contractor, all the school does is provide a kitchen. I am there basically as a luxury for kids to purchase a lunch instead of bringing one from home. Parents voted to keep this service even though on the daily I only cook for 1% of the students.\nThe principal took her complaint. Not 100% if it was forwarded to my actual boss yet.", "The kid said he understood and wasnt bothered by it. Then He goes home wining to Mommy? God these kids suck and so do their caretakers!! Teach That Kid To Speak Up For Himself. She made sure to personally apologize while serving & ask his thoughts. Soooo if he wouldve vocalized that hes unhappy without a desert, then she would\u2019ve supplied an alternative. But instead he says hes OK and kept it moving\u2026 She\u2019s not a mind reader she\u2019s human yall \nNTAH", "Agreed.  Everybody jumping on this ONE PERSON.   Its too my h on her.  Its the school.", "This was my thought as well.  OP is NTA, because she is single-handedly preparing special holiday meals while also preparing regular meals, balancing the cafeteria budget, probably doing kitchen clean-up, attempting to accommodate the dietary restrictions of all students, dealing with power outages and maybe limited rural food options, fielding parental complaints face-to-face and online.....all probably getting paid less than she should.  \n\nThe administration needs to be fielding these concerns, and giving extra $$$ so that OP can afford to give out yogurt cups to any student who gets jealous that GF kid is getting \"special\" dessert.", "Agreed. She was 1 cook for almost 100 students. If it\u2019s important for the students to have balanced meals meeting their needs parents of those students should be volunteering. OP you did your best.", "everyone saying \"Y T A\" has no idea what they're talking about. This isn't a restaurant. This is government funded food they have to order en masse. Unless the kid has a doctor's note, they are not required to cover for their dietary needs. It's the parents job to accommodate their child's special diet. The school is massively failing their lunch program, and is setting up the singular worker to fail. NTA.", "This is what I was thinking too. I think some of these commenters are parents who forget that employees are simply human. She\u2019s not a magician, and if the kid said that he wasn\u2019t bothered by it How would she know to give them the popsicle? The squeaky oil gets the wheel! Teach that kid to speak up for himself, with dietary restrictions it\u2019ll help in the longrun", "I'm in Canada. This is a public rural school.\nThink of my cafeteria service like a short order cook. On a typical day, 90% of the kids bring their lunch from home. 10% order something from me, like nuggets, pizza, etc. \nThis kid doesn't typically order from me. The only things he can safely purchase are the packaged frozen yogurt but he rarely takes money to buy them. I have purchased gluten free pasta and flour (out of my own money) to have on hand so if he ever wanted to order spaghetti or a baked good, or even forgot his lunch, I could accommodate him. Only once he strolled in saying he wanted a muffin, and after a lot of sanitation, I was able to make it happen and was happy to do so.\nThis meal all came about because the principal received a financial donation of $150 and asked if it was possible to provide some kind of hot meal for the entire school so that the 90% of kids who never order, get a chance to eat a hot lunch from the cafeteria instead of having to bring their lunch from home. There was a survey sent home to parents and most voted for a traditional christmas dinner type meal.\nI knew this kid was gluten free, and through conversations I knew there was at least 2 vegetarian families. Working with the supplies I had on hand, I tried to make it happen so that there was some kind of food for everyone. I chose the gingerbread because it doesn't have milk, because I assumed there are lactose sensitive kids I wasn't warned about. We ended up with a few school closure which greatly reduced my prep/cooking time but I *thought* I had managed to get everything done. When the kid came up for the cookie, I definitely had the panic that I forgot, but he seemed understanding.  The moment fleeted, I thought it was passed, until the next day when Mom came in yelling. I had spent the last 2 weeks trying to pull this together. I realized I got defensive and let emotions get the better of me. Then she posed in the parent fb group and parent's were siding with her. That made me furious. I feel badly about forgetting but it wasn't intentional but she's making it seem like it was. \nI love my job. I do more than the last lunch lady was willing to do for the kids. Maybe its just because its the holidays and I'm feeling more emotional than usual. I dunno. The whole situation sucks.", "I realize it wasn't a balanced meal for everyone. I was working off of a parent survey of foods and had a limited budget. I did what I could for the majority of kids. \nMy cafeteria services normally don't provide for the whole school. We usually have a limited menu (nuggets, fries, pizza, treats, etc) for anyone who wants to purchase food rather than bring a bagged lunch.", "But realistically, this is life with dietary restrictions. It sucks, and I agree a popsicle should have been offered instead - but the OP did try to make gluten free cookies in a small school on a very limited budget. This stuff is going to happen to your kid all her life. It doesn't have to be a big deal. \n\nA much more reasonable option would have been for the mom to ask what happened, and then say thank you for trying; I understand the blackouts made it hard. In the future, let's just offer her a popsicle instead (I personally wouldn't trust a homemade gf cookie unless the person talked me through their processes). Let me know if I should put in a formal request for accommodations with the principle so it's always on file.", "100%. I also have a child with celiac. Staff let\u2019s me know all the time when treats are planned so I can send something. While ideally staff would accommodate it if they were already supplying 100% for the other children, I\u2019d much rather send something from home than have my child excluded.", "I'm more concerned about how OP was thinking about making gluten free and gluten cookies.... using the same pans I'm assuming. Cross contamination", "Also I don\u2019t know the cost implications, but making them all GF might have been a viable option here. Gingerbread cookies are all about how they look, and they taste pretty bad at the best of times - I love gluten and I wouldn\u2019t miss it in a gingerbread cookie.", "They are going to get left out.  Do your duty to your child and raise them to understand that.", "Yeah, I'm definitely regretting using the word whim when I wrote this in frustration. People really latched on to it.", "> I disagreed, saying that the children who do not like gingerbread didn't get an option of another dessert. I was not prepared to have those options for all the kids, so sadly it couldn't be an option to him.\n\nI can't agree just due to this quote from OP. She did make an honest mistake, but she didn't really own it, she tried to cover up her mistake with a bullshit excuse instead of saying \"you're absolutely right, I just didn't think of that at the time.\" She probably doesn't need to get punished for the mistake, but the mistake is a bit assholish", "she can make a mistake but still have been an asshole. because she was.", "If the school has frozen yogurt and popsicles available, it would have taken all of a minute to solve this problem. Sounds like you made this about your martyrdom rather than shoving a problem.", "Thank you for understanding how a crowd of 100 kids would actually act if they had of saw a frozen yogurt. This was definitely on my mind when the mom was yelling at me. \nI know an allergy and a preference are different but to 100 ramped up elementary kids, they don't care.", "Mom wouldn\u2019t have a preference on file with the school\u2014 they don\u2019t track that sh*t. It\u2019s either an allergy or celiac.", "\"Food whim\" is what got me. Maybe OP would like people to explain what their gluten 'whims' do when ignored. For the word 'whim,' among other things, OP is TA.", "This was her literal job. She gets PAID to feed the children. And not wanting to get sick from a food allergy isn't a whim. You sound like such a lovely person. /s", "OP did have something for everyone and just chose not to give it to the kid.", "If you honestly forgot then that\u2019s fine, it happens (you\u2019re still TAH but it\u2019s accidental) but your whole post is justification for why you were RIGHT to exclude him. \n\nSometimes, in trying desperately to avoid saying \u201csorry, my bad,\u201d we turn ourselves into far worse AHs than we otherwise would have been.", "Then why didn\u2019t you provide an alternative that you had available so that he was not completely left out?", "I disagree. YTA.", "The times where it benefits us with allergies always makes me unreasonably happy \ud83d\ude02 because i know what it\u2019s like to miss out on a lot of nice stuff due to my many allergies.\n\nFun fact: one of these times for me was that - since i have a dairy allergy - I couldn\u2019t have chocolate for Easter (not really any options 15 years ago) I got DVDs instead!", "I know gluten free isn't a whim. In the course of the day I deal with a lot of kids who air their food grievances at me. I tend to lump them all together as a big group of things I can't always accommodate even though I really want to.", "I appreciate this. Thank you.\nI know I probably didn't handle Mom the best but I certainly don't have anything against the kid. I wasn't intentionally excluding him. I think Mom just jumped into mamabear mode over a perceived injustice. He didn't even seem to care about the cookie. I think she was more mad for him.", "Mom's reaction can be overblown while still leaving op TA for not having a gluten free option for the kid. The first does not preclude the second. Mom is doing the mama bear thing, and while it CAN make her an AH as well, in this case, she was also right, which dulls a lot of the \"over the top\" she came across.", "The gravy was surprisingly good. The kiddos took part in a community garden and I used their onions, carrots, and herbs for my mirepoix.", "Then the school, or better yet the parent, should be doing that if she\u2019s so upset her kid couldn\u2019t have a cookie ONCE. It\u2019s definitely not the cafeteria worker who should be planning and paying for that. What the fuck?", "The family could of supplied these snack to keep on hand as well.", "Thank you!

In the one comment she said a letter was sent home to parents laying out the menu, which was totally free to them btw. The parent could have easily packed a gf cookie for her kid instead of berating her and going to administration about her.

Can I gently suggest that you stop putting yourself in that position. If a parent is going to come unglued because their sweet baby didn\u2019t get a cookie, I can only imagine how they will react if their kid gets sick and the parent could find even a slight link to something you purchased and brought in for them since this parent thinks you went out of your way to exclude this kid. \n\nI also think that the principal really dropped the ball by allowing the parent to come speak to you without scheduling in advance.", "Then you should have told the school that the budget was insufficient to feed all the kids as requested.
