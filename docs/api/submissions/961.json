I reiterated that I wasn't that comfortable with this, she asked why and I explained that whilst I knew this was never her intention, her telling me I have to be Scooby because I don't look like any of the other characters makes me feel like I am forced to be a dog because of my brown skin and it reminds me of being the old one out at school (I went to a school in rural England where my family was one of 4 families of colour). \n\nWhitney got really upset and stormed out of the restaurant with my other flatmate and then said that I tried to call her a racist, even though I specifically said at the start of my reasoning and I don't think she was a racist.

As a contrast my (white) kid went as Scooby for Halloween and no one complained about how he didn't \"look\" the part (yeah, no brown face paint).

Gender and race bending well known characters is half the fun of cosplay.   \n\nThey should have just put all the character's names into a hat and drawn them out and then you each take a turn drawing the name out.

But people also don\u2019t like having to realize they\u2019ve been racist because racist = horrible bad people. \n\nThey see it as a judgment of their whole character rather than an instance of racism and resist it rather than understanding anyone can be racist.
