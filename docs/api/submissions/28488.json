My grandparents adored my mom and saw her as a daughter (they had four boys) and wanted to welcome her to the family with the ring. She treasured it and before she died she and they had discussed my grandparents keeping it safe for me.\n\nAfter my mom died my dad remarried. His second wife was upset that she wasn't offered the ring like my mom was. My grandparents explained it was being kept safe for me, as the last owner had wanted her only child (aka me) to have it.\n\nMy dad's wife came into the marriage with a daughter just like dad had me. I was 9 and she was 7. We're now 22 (me) and 20 (her).\n\nMy stepsister got engaged a few weeks ago. Her boyfriend proposed without a ring because he wanted her to pick one out. She decided to ask dad if she could have the family engagement ring. He asked my grandparents and they said no. His wife told my grandparents it might not be me but the ring would still be going to their granddaughter. They said not the granddaughter it was intended for and my stepsister was not my mom's daughter therefore she would not be entitled to it and my mom would have hated to see it go to my stepsister.\n\nWhen speaking to my grandparents failed, my dad and his wife came to me. My stepsister was upset that they didn't overrule what my mom wanted. She has some abandonment issues. Her dad abandoned her, neither side of her biological family want her and my grandparents and uncles are the only extended family she ever had but she always felt like they favored me because of how much they loved my mom and how often they spoke about her and about us (me and mom). Them turning her down really got her down. So my dad and his wife wanted me to make it up to her and wanted me to take the ring and then give it to her. My dad said it would mean so much to my stepsister and while it would mean I don't get that ring, I could still get another ring and it would make a family member happy. His wife said they had both lived in my mom's shadow from day one and this could be a time where they are not treated as secondary to my mom. She said her daughter always adored me and never saw me as a stepsister and it hurt her that I never saw her as a sister. She said I could do this and make her feel loved like she deserves.\n\nI refused to give my stepsister the ring and my dad and his wife told me I was being selfish and hurtful.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1696775764, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1730off/aita_for_not_giving_a_family_engagement_ring_to/", "score": 1363, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The ring is technically from my paternal family and therefore she would be part of that. But my mom was the last owner and she wanted the ring saved for me.

I'm confused about why your step mom and step sister are so invested in receiving this ring when they have literally no connection to it. The ring belonged to *your* mother and she made it clear she would be handing it down to *you.* How bizarre that either of them would insist on taking that away from you, and it's even more bizarre that your father would go along with them. \n\nYou've already given them your answer and you need to stand your ground on this. There is absolutely no reason for them to guilt you into giving up something that has so much sentimental value for you simply because they decided they should have it instead of you.", "NTA, you lost a _mother_ at a young age and you're supposed to part with the only thing you have from her?\n\nThat's the deal when marrying a widow(er), the departed will always be present in some way, and that's OK as long as it doesn't go overhand.", "Nta\n\nBare with me for a moment lol.\n\nHonestly, due to the fact that the paternal grandparents gave OP's mom the ring it is up to them who gets it. It is a paternal family ring. The fact they are honoring the 1st wife's wishes is so heartfelt that I wanna cry. They loved OP's mom very much and their actions scream that. Win for Grandparents!!!\n\nSecondly, it sounds as if the step mum just wants a \"win\" over the 1st wife. It isn't about being close to the family for her, imo. It also sounds as if the grandparents aren't very fond of her, has she been an upstager the entire marriage? I say those because of the \"in her shadow\" comment. What the actual HELL is that supposed to mean? Jealous much? That just comes to mind.\n\nOP, how is your relationship to the two of them? Personally, I would ask grandparents to give the brat another ring just to avoid the drama and save my momma's ring from getting stolen. How old are your grandparents? Is there a will?

She had an affair, got pregnant and my dad accepted her bastard child as his. My mom's mother taught me to sew starting when I was just 5 and I had a child's sewing machine (the needle, bobbin and thread were in a cartridge) that I used to make clothes for my dolls. I fell in love with Colleen Moore's dollhouse at the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry and I had a massive, gorgeous collection of dolls and furniture that I was so proud of because I actually made a lot of it. I also had Bryer horses that I collected and I got one for my birthday, Christmas, and whenever I accomplished something big so I had a lot of them. When my dad divorced her (so she could marry the guy she had an affair with) he let her have everything, including *my* things. I'm almost 10 years older than her daughter but the bitch kept my clothes \"for her daughter\"! That woman was pathological about the fact that my dad was married before her (even though he divorced my mom to be with her) and, as the proof that he loved someone before her, she made my life hell! Years later I found some pictures she'd recently sent to my dad and a couple of them were a display of my horses and doll stuff. She hadn't added to it and the way it was displayed her kid couldn't play with it. In one picture I could see my sewing machine, my favorite outfit from my 10th birthday was there, and some of the usual kid things my mom had bought me. I was almost 18, they divorced when I was 10, and that bitch actually had my things displayed like damn trophies in her bedroom!\n\nShe and my dad reconnected when I was in my 30s and I met her daughter. I casually mentioned that I hoped she'd enjoyed playing with my doll stuff and horses as much as I had and she told me that *her mom punished her if she even touched the display case* and she'd never played with any of it! Your stepmom doesn't sound as unhinged as mine was but holy fuck! To be jealous of a dead woman is insane and to demand that her daughter get an heirloom to you from your mom to \"prove\" that her daughter is a \"real\" member of your dad's family is a no-win scenario. No matter what you do or give her daughter is never going to be made to feel like she's a \"real daughter.\" And how far will it go? If she can't have kids but you can are you supposed to be her surrogate? If you buy a house are you supposed to buy her one, too?

Not much, but a little. And she should\u2019ve gotten over it by now. Her daughter though? Nope. I appreciate the idea of blended families, however, when these changes happen after promises and expectations have already been set for how to handle family heirlooms, it\u2019s never going to be fair to everyone. Someone is always going to miss out whether it\u2019s the kid who has thought this item was coming to them their whole life or the kid who feels like her new family doesn\u2019t love her as much as the bio kids.

They said not the granddaughter it was intended for and my stepsister was not my mom's daughter therefore she would not be entitled to it and my mom would have hated to see it go to my stepsister.\n\nWhen speaking to my grandparents failed, my dad and his wife came to me. My stepsister was upset that they didn't overrule what my mom wanted. She has some abandonment issues. Her dad abandoned her, neither side of her biological family want her and my grandparents and uncles are the only extended family she ever had but she always felt like they favored me because of how much they loved my mom and how often they spoke about her and about us (me and mom). Them turning her down really got her down. So my dad and his wife wanted me to make it up to her and wanted me to take the ring and then give it to her. My dad said it would mean so much to my stepsister and while it would mean I don't get that ring, I could still get another ring and it would make a family member happy. His wife said they had both lived in my mom's shadow from day one and this could be a time where they are not treated as secondary to my mom. She said her daughter always adored me and never saw me as a stepsister and it hurt her that I never saw her as a sister. She said I could do this and make her feel loved like she deserves.\n\nI refused to give my stepsister the ring and my dad and his wife told me I was being selfish and hurtful.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It is their fault for viewing it that way (them saying they have been 'living in her Shadow' to guilt you).

Honestly, your dad could even secretly gift them a piece of jewelry and ask them to gift it to her. It doesn\u2019t need to be THIS piece unless their intention is to hurt you by depriving you of something deeply sentimental to only you. It\u2019s not a competition and if they fail to recognize this, you can assume that the root of their intention is hate, not love.", "I hate to be blunt, but it\u2019s a family heirloom. No matter how close the family is you are your parents grandchild and the ring was given to YOUR mother by them. They have resisted this for 20 years, they want to see their ring on your finger. It\u2019s not up to you, and it\u2019s incredibly distasteful that this is still a conversation after they have been given an answer. \n\nNow they are trying to guilt you, which would hurt your grandparents but they don\u2019t seem to care about that. You are NTA, do NOT give in here.", "Or--how valuable is this ring? Much more than your 20 year old stepsister's fiance would ever be able to buy? Maybe I'm just cynical, but if the ring is valuable, or if the fiance, who is likely quite young, isn't able to spend very much, I suspect that has a lot to do with it. She wants to go and show everyone the fancy engagement ring. And it's always something she could sell later if she needs the money. Or sell the stone and replace it with an inexpensive dupe. DON'T give it to her. It was your mom's ring and it shouldn't be on her hand but on yours if that's what you want. Your dad and stepmom can buy her an expensive ring that she can start her own tradition with.", "If you were 20 when your mom passed they wouldn\u2019t dream of being so inconsiderate, do not give away your mothers ring. You\u2019re nta whatsoever. Stepmom/sis are fucked up for thinking to ask you at all. If they are pulling a race card then they are just stupid people. This has nothing to do with race or them period, and everything to do with your mothers wishes. My mom passed when I was 23 and reading this honestly boiled my blood. Your mom didn\u2019t want you to have to buy a ring. If you don\u2019t want the ring fine, but keep the stone. For them to ask you to pay for a new diamond just to make them feel included is super entitled and insensitive behavior. It\u2019s not your fault your sisters boyfriend didn\u2019t wait to propose until he had an engagement ring. I have a sneaking suspicion your stepsister orchestrated this whole thing, and he knew he might not have to buy a ring so he just proposed without one.

I\u2019d never dream of asking someone (demanding really, let\u2019s be real here) to give me a family heirloom that their deceased parent wanted them to have, regardless of any personal issues I might be dealing with.

You may find you get on better than you think. But stepmonster sounds greedy, selfish and awful.", "It was never hers to begin with!!! She doesn't have the right to feel bad bec she never really had any ounce of chance to get it as well. She's not directly related to your paternal grandparents.

My ******* uncle and aunt stole her jewelry off her body when the paramedics stopped working on her, and before the funeral home arrived under the guise, they wanted a moment alone with her. My mom never got any of the rings back as the ones who stole it are who they are they were likely poaned for cheap for drugs and not kept in the family as the heirlooms they were. If you can put it somewhere, they can not get to, do it!! 100% do it!! Hopefully, they would never be that slimy, but you never know, so protection is important.", "I wouldn't have the ring in the same house as the steps.

This is about power. Your step-mom is trying to establish dominance over OP and her dead mother.", "I'm also wondering if they are greedy. Do you have any idea if they have ever seen the ring, and do you have any idea what it is worth?", " I don\u2019t want to hear about this being unfair to her, considering that I\u2019d gladly give up the ring to have my mother back.", "I have to wonder if OP's stepsister told her BF if he proposed she'd supply the ring?", "[removed]", "That ring belonged to a woman your dads current wife never even met.

It belongs to op.", "Sounds like they meant for OP and her partner to buy a new ring.", "None of this is OP's fault or responsibility, though. She does not have to give up her late mother's ring in order to prove that she loves and accepts her step mom and step sister. The fact that they are trying to guilt her and manipulate her into giving up this last connection to her bio mom is really terrible.", "Seems like his former/deceased wife knew he couldn't be trusted to make sure their daughter inherited the ring, and that's why the grandparents are in possession of it at the moment.", "YES! Tell your grandparents right away!", "You could point out to your step sister that she still has her mother and you don't.

Op should not be involved in this at all though, it's purely an issue between her father and his parents.", "Fianc\u00e9 can still pay for it, it would require OP to take pictures and send to the jeweller.. and step sis would then have the same ring and potentially feel closer to the family.
