The ring is technically from my paternal family and therefore she would be part of that. But my mom was the last owner and she wanted the ring saved for me.

I'm confused about why your step mom and step sister are so invested in receiving this ring when they have literally no connection to it. The ring belonged to *your* mother and she made it clear she would be handing it down to *you.* How bizarre that either of them would insist on taking that away from you, and it's even more bizarre that your father would go along with them. \n\nYou've already given them your answer and you need to stand your ground on this. There is absolutely no reason for them to guilt you into giving up something that has so much sentimental value for you simply because they decided they should have it instead of you.", "NTA, you lost a _mother_ at a young age and you're supposed to part with the only thing you have from her?\n\nThat's the deal when marrying a widow(er), the departed will always be present in some way, and that's OK as long as it doesn't go overhand.", "Nta\n\nBare with me for a moment lol.\n\nHonestly, due to the fact that the paternal grandparents gave OP's mom the ring it is up to them who gets it. It is a paternal family ring. The fact they are honoring the 1st wife's wishes is so heartfelt that I wanna cry. They loved OP's mom very much and their actions scream that. Win for Grandparents!!!\n\nSecondly, it sounds as if the step mum just wants a \"win\" over the 1st wife. It isn't about being close to the family for her, imo. It also sounds as if the grandparents aren't very fond of her, has she been an upstager the entire marriage? I say those because of the \"in her shadow\" comment. What the actual HELL is that supposed to mean? Jealous much? That just comes to mind.\n\nOP, how is your relationship to the two of them? Personally, I would ask grandparents to give the brat another ring just to avoid the drama and save my momma's ring from getting stolen. How old are your grandparents? Is there a will?

You want to keep the ring, which is fair, it's a connection to your mom. Your stepsister's abandonment issues are not yours to solve as you didn't cause them in the first place.

My mom's mother taught me to sew starting when I was just 5 and I had a child's sewing machine (the needle, bobbin and thread were in a cartridge) that I used to make clothes for my dolls. I fell in love with Colleen Moore's dollhouse at the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry and I had a massive, gorgeous collection of dolls and furniture that I was so proud of because I actually made a lot of it. I also had Bryer horses that I collected and I got one for my birthday, Christmas, and whenever I accomplished something big so I had a lot of them. When my dad divorced her (so she could marry the guy she had an affair with) he let her have everything, including *my* things. I'm almost 10 years older than her daughter but the bitch kept my clothes \"for her daughter\"! That woman was pathological about the fact that my dad was married before her (even though he divorced my mom to be with her) and, as the proof that he loved someone before her, she made my life hell! Years later I found some pictures she'd recently sent to my dad and a couple of them were a display of my horses and doll stuff. She hadn't added to it and the way it was displayed her kid couldn't play with it. In one picture I could see my sewing machine, my favorite outfit from my 10th birthday was there, and some of the usual kid things my mom had bought me. I was almost 18, they divorced when I was 10, and that bitch actually had my things displayed like damn trophies in her bedroom!\n\nShe and my dad reconnected when I was in my 30s and I met her daughter. I casually mentioned that I hoped she'd enjoyed playing with my doll stuff and horses as much as I had and she told me that *her mom punished her if she even touched the display case* and she'd never played with any of it! Your stepmom doesn't sound as unhinged as mine was but holy fuck! To be jealous of a dead woman is insane and to demand that her daughter get an heirloom to you from your mom to \"prove\" that her daughter is a \"real\" member of your dad's family is a no-win scenario. No matter what you do or give her daughter is never going to be made to feel like she's a \"real daughter.\" And how far will it go? If she can't have kids but you can are you supposed to be her surrogate? If you buy a house are you supposed to buy her one, too?

I appreciate the idea of blended families, however, when these changes happen after promises and expectations have already been set for how to handle family heirlooms, it\u2019s never going to be fair to everyone. Someone is always going to miss out whether it\u2019s the kid who has thought this item was coming to them their whole life or the kid who feels like her new family doesn\u2019t love her as much as the bio kids.

Them turning her down really got her down. So my dad and his wife wanted me to make it up to her and wanted me to take the ring and then give it to her. My dad said it would mean so much to my stepsister and while it would mean I don't get that ring, I could still get another ring and it would make a family member happy. His wife said they had both lived in my mom's shadow from day one and this could be a time where they are not treated as secondary to my mom.
