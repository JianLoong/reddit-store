We also live very close to each other like(my flat is exactly 560m from her flat). The only thing that some time bothers us is our income disparity. I make almost 3 times more than her and I also have intraday trading accounts so I also earn money from their too. It some time makes unbalanced in our relationship but I am always very mindful to treat money carefully arround her. I don't spend carelessly in front of her and I pay majority of our dates and all. \n\nIn 2021 I bought a MacBook pro and after using it for almost 1.5 yr I don't like working on it anymore and i decided to give it to my younger sister (18f). I know it sounds snobbish but I wanted to build a gaming pc for me and now the pc part are all time low price so i am building a very expensive gaming pc. After booking everything online I told my gf about this and she started telling me how much I am spending on something when I already have a expensive laptop. I told her everything that you can't game on mackooks and it's work laptop and I need a gaming pc for me but she kept going on and on about how unnecessary it is. Finally after half and hour i just told her if it's bothering you that much don't pay attention to it and it's my money I can use it however I want. Again she got emotional and left. Now she is giving me cold shoulder and I am feeling very complicated.", "created_utc": 1695242387, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16nvut3/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_that_its_my_money/", "score": 448, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have separate households and salaries. You are allowed to spend your money.", "NTA: It's your money. And you two aren't living together. Also, if your spending habits are really something to worry about, then where's that concern when it came to you paying for the majority of your dates?   \n\n\nIt does seem a bit unfair that you can pay for the majority of your dates without problem and yet you buying something for yourself is suddenly something worth scrutinizing.", "I think you should have a serious talk about your expectations for the future - in terms of finances.  You should discuss how this works now and how do you both expect it to work in the future if your relationship becomes serious enough to take the next step. If you can;t come to some sort of agreement you need to consider if you can even pursue the relationship. Good luck. NTA in this situation, if you have separate finances, living arrangements etc... You are not obligated to ask her for any sort of permission. Plus she's kinda rude, lecturing you  and all, you are giving the old one to your sister, not use it as a practice target at a shooting range or something , so it is hardly a waste", "NTA. You're only dating and she wants to manage your financial decisions? Yeah, no thanks.", "NTA. If you two were living together, and your spending was affecting your joint expenses, different story. You live alone, you're not hurting for money. You're not sacrificing necessities to get a gaming pc. You're using your money, that you've earned. She doesn't get veto power over how you spend your money, especially given the relatively short length of the relationship.\n\nIf y'all were married, or living together, then the expense would have been worth a conversation, at least. But as it stand, you're fine.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA\n\nIt does not sound like you have joint finances so as long as this expense isn\u2019t putting you in the red or something, she should mind her own business", "NTA. your gf can\u2019t keep trying to control the way you use your money !", "NTA, you do not owe any explanation to anyone about how you use your own money.", "NTA.

When its your money, you are financially stable and have no joint finances with her or anyone, its your call. Its not snobbish to build a gaming pc either. You'd use it more than a MacBook and your sister probably really needed it. I can see her asking you why, maybe out of concern if she had no idea how much you made. Continuing to badger you for a half an hour? NOPE. That's her insecurity coming through.", "NTA\n\nShe's past half way thinking that your money is now her money. Only 1.3 years together and not living together either, she has absolutely no say in how you spend what you earn. Unless both of you are already talking about living together and saving for the future/house.\n\nI recommend that before your relationship gets seriously financially entangled there should be agreements about everything related to money and how much is expected from each. Protect yourselves. This way she won't end up feeling financially abused and you don't feel like an ATM.", "NTA.  \n\n\nShe is jealous of your income and trying to manage your money. Sounds like you are doing well enough on your own.   \n\n\nEx said to me \"It is your money, buy what you want\".

One requisite is that we would have to be on relatively equal financial footing. Disparity causes problems.", "NTA but you gf clearly has emotions around money and if you want to be a supportive partner, try to avoid getting defensive. Get curious instead. \u201cI can see you are upset by my purchase, why do you think that is? Why is the way I spend my money important to you? I want to understand your upset - What fears or anxieties are you feeling?\u201d This might help her process and identify what she\u2019s REALLY feeling (for example, I am afraid that our future won\u2019t be financially stable because I grew up poor and anxious about having money for food). Then you can work through it together instead of trying to fight about who is right and who is wrong.", "NTA.  Why does she think she gets an opinion on how you spend your money?  This is super controlling behavior and is honestly a red flag.  You should be very wary of ever merging finances with this woman, where she really might legally get the power to tell you how to spend money she hasn't earned.", "NTA - I am a woman who loves gaming, and it seems to me that your girlfriend simply does not understand that this is a hobby for you and it is required to pay that amount to enjoy gaming in high quality these days.\n\nDoesn't seem to me that any of you is particularly malicious here though. \n\nI think you might just explain to her better that this is your hobby and something you enjoy, and it unfortunately costs this amount. Even then you were money-responsible to actually check prices and see the best deals. On top of that - you have money to spend, it's not like you have spent last money that was supposed to go to rent or for food. You are 100% allowed to do what you want with your money. \n\nShe also has some hobbies probably and I am certain you could also say that something she does seems to you like a waste of time, money or just silly. She needs to understand that nothing bad happened because of her boyfriend buying PC to play some games. People are allowed to have hobbies. Maybe she is worried that you won't be spending much time with her becasue of games (listen I just finished 2-nd run of Baldur's Gate 3), but if you are responsible adult - this won't be a problem\n\nAnd if it is still a problem for her after explaining peacefully - well, that's a red flag in my humble opinion. Happy gaming.", "NTA.  It is your money and you can spend it the way you want. \n\nWhy is she trying to control your spending?  Are you thinking about getting married, buying a house? Does she want that and you don't? This is coming from somewhere and she needs to vocalize WHY she is so upset, not just that you are doing something she doesn't like/approve of.", "It\u2019s not even that much money. At least you\u2019re building computers not cars! NTA.", "NTA you want a gaming pc, you dont have one\n\nYou saved up money to buy said gaming pc\nAll of a sudden no your not allowed to because???? \n\nFuck that sounds like they want to choose how you spend your money, so long ad you have plans to be in a finacially secure place by 50 you are fine to do w/e the fuck you want OP and if they don't like it then you either need to submit to them convince them to change their minds or move on from them \n\nMaybe let them know you have plans in place to be financially secure in the future?", "NTA. Does she ever get anxious about other expensive (expensive being relative) things? If so, maybe she\u2019s just hardwired to track every penny. If not, then it is kind of odd that she doesn\u2019t express the same concerns when you spend money on her.", "NTA\n\nYou're very generous as it is, and giving your sister the laptop is way better than just throwing it away\n\nI don't know how much money exactly that you're making, but it sounds like you're making quite an amount and that you're not affected too much by the price of this new custom rig that you're gonna build\n\nYou don't live together, you don't share bank accounts, and she's making demands of how you spend your money?\n\nAre you saving some of this money? Or are you just making expenses?\n\nAlso, have you told her that you've been planning on making this purchase for a long time?", "First, NTA.  \n\nHowever, I'm going to try to give her the benefit of the doubt, here.  Because she doesn't make as much money, she may not understand what sort of after-tax income you have available.  For her, she may see what you're doing as a red flag, as you're spending a large amount of money on something that she sees as a frivolous expense - this may make her concerned for her financial future if the two of you were to get married (probably something in the back of her mind).  Instead of addressing that concern, you dismissed it, telling her that she has no say in what you do and how you spend your money.  \n\nMy guess is that if you sat her down and had a more in-depth conversation about your finances, what you save/have saved vs what you spend, she may feel more secure in you being a reliable partner.  You'd also smooth over the issue of seemingly ignoring her feelings and making her feel like she doesn't have a say in your relationship.  \n\nAt the end of the day, I don't necessarily disagree that you can spend your money on whatever you want... but if this is someone you're considering a serious relationship with, you may want to temper that approach a little.", "NTA\n\nI make below the poverty level (disabled) and the person I am dating right now and the last person I dated both made 6 figures. \n\nIt is their money. They are allowed to splurge on things, have expensive hobbies. \n\nBut we did talk a lot about money, how to handle the discrepancy, how we would combine finances, and our beliefs and values around money. You need to be making sure you're financially compatible, not in terms of income but in terms of goals and mindset. \n\nShe is probably stressed (as I have been) to see someone spend on something unnecessary after living in a poverty mindset for so long. If you live a life where $1000 would change your entire year, it's hard to see it spent on something not needed. \n\nBut the reality is that the world is full of people who spend without thinking what I live on in a month. And the world is full of people who would give anything to live at my level of poverty. \n\nIt's hard to grapple with. It's the reality of how unfair the world truly is. I have had to spend a lot of time on it because I am not in a position to ever make more or change circumstances. This is just what life handed me. I am worse off than 99% of the US, and still better of than 80% of the rest of the world.", "NTA. You earn it-you can spend it how you please. Fuck her", "NTA you make your own money you can spend it how you like. She can politely give you her opinion but at the end of the day she needs to remember, you make it, you can spend it, however responsibly, or irresponsibly you\u2019d like\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I\u2019d recommend prenups if marriage becomes a topic. Good luck", "The women you date will always see your money as their money. If you're not spending it on them, it's a waste.

It is what it is. You're NTA, but keep that in mind.", "NTA. Let her sulk, she shouldn\u2019t be judging you like this.", "NTA, She's just going to get worse.", "NTA. I spent 5 grand building one myself. For the record, it's been worth every penny and has provided me lots of hours of entertainment. It's your money. Don't fall into the female feelings trap on this. That is a bottomless pit that can be twisted to their advantage in any situation. I'm not saying to be a dick about everything, but there's boundaries in every successful relationship. Long term relationships are about finding someone who fits with you. Frankly if your income disparity is that great I'd also suggest never discussing marriage without the prenup talk coming immediately after.

She ain't the one bro", "Did she maybe come from a family where money was not in abundance? I grew up poor and sometimes struggle internally with things I perceive to be a waste of money.

Is she struggling financially", "Seems like your need for gaming outweighs your need for female companionship. Time to pick a lane.", "NTA.\n\nIt is your money and your choice. \n\nThe one thing I will say it I think GF is coming from a place of seeing you just frivolously spend, rather than saving for the future or something else. The fact that you are buying another probably $2k computer/laptop in the time the two of you have been together might be a red flag to her. \n\n\nAt your ages and time together, she is likely starting to think of a future together, and while it is your money, she might question if you are always going to be so quick to rush into a purchase in the future. Basically, you aren't showing restraint now, if the relationship evolves, that will be her problem to deal with in the future.\n\nAlso giving away a computer worth hundreds of dollars, even if to family, is still weird over selling it to help cover the cost of the new one.", "Nobody is really an asshole here. OP she\u2019s showing concern because she loves you. It may come across as babying but it most likely comes from a good place.\n\nThis is easily mendable but if you intend on making this relationship serious/long term/for good then a bigger conversation over spending needs to be had where both of you are treating each other with respect.\n\nI agree though at this point it is your money and she should let you do as you please, but you should also put up with a tiny bit of nagging. Just comes with being in love.", "You can say basically the same thing without it coming across as aggressive.  I would imagine that you hit on her financial insecurity and your tone just hit wrong.

I.E. if you've got kids and a mortgage then buying an expensive gaming PC might be a dick move. But right now?

You need a girlfriend who knows her financial boundaries.", "bro run shes a gold digger", "YTA.\n\nYes, it is your money and yes, you can do what you like with it.  This is not about what you can do though, but what is respectful in your relationship.\n\n1. I'm sure you already know that money is one of the main reasons that people break up.  You need to be on the same page about money.  Let's forget for a second about who is right or wrong about how to spend money.  You and your girlfriend both need to have the same values about money for your relationship to work.  \n\n2. She makes much less than you.  Relationships rarely work out when one partner is living like a king and the other one is not.  I spend every waking moment around expensive computers but I understand--and know that you do too--how extravagant your purchases are.  You need to understand that she feels offended and shocked by how much you're spending.\n\nYou can talk with her and explain that your plan allows your sister to have a good machine.  You can tell her that this is your hobby.  You can negotiate with her--ask if there's anything you can do in terms of saving money on something else or helping the poor or whatever to make her feel comfortable with what you;re doing .  But ultimately, you are both going to need to reach some level of comfort with what is going on.  \n\nMy guess is that this is not your only extravagant purchase.  You need to understand that she is looking at your habits and wondering if you'll be a reliable partner in future.  Are you going to spend all the rent/mortgage money on a luxury item when you guys are living together, for example.  This is not just about a gaming pc.  She is wondering who you are and you need to figure out what you want your answer to be.", "NAH. i think she might be just wishing she could afford a new laptop? \n\nOf course your money is your business and you can spend it however you want, but it really could be she\u2019s feeling sad about being poorer than you, and expressing that in a not-super-clear way.", "Maybe you could have sold the idea to her a little more before dropping that phrasing. Maybe articulate the hours of entertainment you are going to get from the new PC that you aren\u2019t able to get with the Apple and other applications for the PC that would benefit you. Maybe let her know your sister gave you some money for the MacBook (even if that\u2019s not the case) Money is one of the top reasons for serious fights in a relationship. I don\u2019t know what stage in y\u2019all\u2019s relationship you\u2019re in, how old you guys are, what kind of background your GF comes from so with limited knowledge my verdict is you won the argument but were kind of an asshole about it\u2026", "YTA.

It's not fair to her. She probably already considers you two married and she believes she has a stake in it.
