{"id": 7500, "submission_id": "10dpvir", "title": "AITA for rejecting a dog adoption application due to a woman's size?", "selftext": "\n\nThis happened recently, and I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m in the wrong.\n\nFor context, I (26M) am a dog breeder. I breed Australian Shepherds, and I take pride in knowing all of my dogs are healthy and go to loving homes. A few months ago, one of my bitches had a litter of 5. After a few weeks I began to go through the process of finding each puppy a home.\n\nI have very high standards for the homes I send my puppies to. If I even have a hunch that this may not be a perfect fit, I will reject an application. For example, I do not accept homes with children under 8, because of the concern of tail/ear pulling, etc.,\n\nOne day, I get an application from a woman I\u2019ll call Sarah(F32). Decent income, no kids, remote job, another dog, decent house with a fenced backyard, willing family nearby to take the dog in case of emergency. All good things. So, I accept her request for a visit (being accepted for a visit \u2260 accepted to take home a dog. It\u2019s a good sign, but not set in stone.)\n\nWhen Sarah arrives, I immediately notice two things. One, she is morbidly obese. Two, her dog (who she brought to meet the other puppy she was interested in) is also obese.\n\nAustralian Shepherds are extremely active. I mean, they\u2019re cattle dogs. They *need* activity. Sarah didn\u2019t look very active, and her dog didn\u2019t either. It\u2019s not easy to get a dog to obesity if it is being fed a decent diet and is active. (This wasn\u2019t a tiny dog, either. If I had to guess, I\u2019d say it was a mid-sized poodle)\n\nSo, I decided to send to reject Sarah\u2019s application. All of the puppy\u2019s went to the homes that I believe were best for them. However, Sarah called me up, and asked why I rejected her application. I was honest and told her that due to both her and her dogs size, I did not believe that the puppy would get adequate exercise.\n\nShe didn\u2019t like that. She began getting agitated, asking why I believed that fat people could not be active and claiming I was discriminating due to her size. She hung up with her final statements being something along the line of \u201cKarma will come for you, fatphobic fuck!\u201d\n\nSarah has since been blasting my business on pretty much every social media platform, and I believe my business has been suffering. I refuse to back down or apologize because I truly believe I did what was right for that dog. However, I can understand how my judgement may be insulting.\n\nSo, AITA for rejecting a woman\u2019s dog adoption application based on her size?", "created_utc": 1673899488, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10dpvir/aita_for_rejecting_a_dog_adoption_application_due/", "score": 167, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her size is not a direct correlation to her activity level. I have friends who are obese who work out way more than me and eat a better diet. \n\nI went with soft because the weight of her other dog is a concern. But still, you worded that so poorly. It really does come off as you don't want to have a dog because she's too fat.", "NTA - you didn't reject the application based on her size, you rejected the application based on her AND her dogs size. If you had rejected based on her size alone then yeah YTA 100% but you have proof she isn't exercising her current dog (I'm assuming you ascertained that her current dog wasn't sick or otherwise disabled and could be exercised)", "NTA \n\nI don't think you're fat phobic. This is your livelihood and you know your stuff. Some dogs need more stimulus than others. I would want breeders to have the same outlook as you when it comes to adoption.\n\nYou're putting the dog first and nobody should have an issue with that.", "Okay - I totally get where you're coming from. I have had herding dogs (usually two of them) at any one time for over twenty years.\n\nAn Aussie pup needs a LOT of mental stimulation and even more exercise. \n\nHowever, I would not have brought her weight into your explanation. I would have simply just said something along the lines of \"we had so many great homes this year and it was so hard to choose\".\n\nTo be fair, just because she herself is overweight wouldn't have been the deal breaker for me. Her current dog being over weight in the extreme would have been though.", "YTA for your complete unrepentance. And also for just assuming that Sarah and her dog are unhealthy and seditary. \n\nYou should have asked how much she and her dog exercise in a day. Actually, with the breed's energy requirement, you should be asking that question to everyone.", "YTA, yes. \n\nYou can't tell someone's activity level by their size or appearance. Nor can you tell how someone feeds their pets based on the pet's size! I have one cat who is very very rolly-polly fat and another who is so sleek she borders on underweight. Same age, same feedings, same playtimes, same everything. Genetics! Fortunately, our vet realizes that *animals have natural variance* and don't assume that we're feeding our sweet fat girl ice cream every night. \n\nETA: I am proud of her for standing up for herself and warning people not to deal with you. She's completely right that you made a bigoted assumption about her based on her appearance.", "YTA, **not for the worry you had** about your puppy not having it's needs met, but the **way you handled it** afterwards when she asked about it. It might have been the best to give simply the reason that you didn't believe it's needs would have been met, as you have strict requirements. That would have been enough. Bringing her weight in was not needed, that's like the only issue I have. Even if it was your reason, it was too much.\n\nI'm overweigt/obese, so I can understand your worry, but on the other hand, my dog has helped me to loose quite a decent amount of weight, although I will be adjusting his walks now due to reactivity. She might have thought about getting an Aussie due to how active they are, but I do not blame you for your worry. I won't judge her for the other dog, it might be overfeeding, but also certain conditions, we don't know that.\n\nWhat I blame you for is what you said to her and I know you meant to be \"only\" honest, but honesty isn't always the best, for other people and your business. You did harm your business now with that, as it does come over in the wrong way. There was really no need to mention it. I think it would have been better to just tell her she didn't meet your requirements and that's it.\n\nI will mainly vote YTA for the way you handled it. N/T/A for the concern over your dog and rejecting the application, especially considering the breed tends to be highly reactive if it doesn't have it's needs met.", "NTA. For caring deeply for the well being of the dogs you breed. Absolutely not.\n\nYTA for not choosing a better way or giving another reason for rejecting her application. As a business owner you are going to have to get better at sugar coating things like that for the health of you business. Speaking from experience. This is a tough one.\n\nI adopted a dog a few years back, German Shepard mix. I was close to 300lbs. I noticed my dog was active as hell and always getting into crap. It actually encouraged me to get off my butt and match his activity levels. He encouraged me to get up and go for walks and play with him in fields. I\u2019m around 190lbs now. I got him from a rescue shelter where you are less likely to get rejected, but I\u2019m not sure what it would have done to my mental state if I\u2019d been told Iooked to fat to own an animal, knowing I\u2019m doing my best to fight medical conditions and stay active. You just never know.\n\nBut by all means, keep being a responsible breeder! Best wishes!", "NTA and anyone saying YTA is insane. Aussies need CONSTANT activity and by virtue of her obese dog you were right to reject her. \n\nObesity isn\u2019t healthy and it shows the dog will suffer if the owner can\u2019t move enough to give them exercise.", "You did the right thing, but it was an asshole move for basically calling her fat. You could have been more tactful, although I understand it might have been difficult when put on the spot. So yeah YTA but I respect your decision.", "YTA - I'm obese partly because of mobility issues due to muscular dystrophy. One of my boxers (also highly active breed) is a service dog. My dogs get walked daily thanks to my use of an electric scooter. They go RV camping with us, go on our boat, etc. You made alot of assumptions. You should hope she has no disability or you opened yourself up to more than just ugly words. So, obviously, YTA.", "NTA - you could be more tactful in future, but your heart was in the right place.", "NTA\n\nat first I was skeptical but when you mentioned the dog being obese I was on your side after that lol, that is so bad for their health", "I go NTA on this one. It makes me crazy when people get dogs and don't take into consideration what they were bred to do. \n\nAustralia shepards aren't only active. They're smart af. They need so much physical and mental stimulation. \n\nI personally would never get one bc I can't provide one with what it needs. Love the breed. Doesn't mean I can take care of one.", "If her other dog is obese that would give me a red flag it's not getting enough exercise or is being overfed. It comes down to your decision, if you feel as though your puppy wouldnt be able to live a healthy active lifestyle with this woman then I agree you should deny her.", "NTA  a good friend of mine had 3 Australian Shepherds and they were A LOT of work and needed constant training and lots of activities to keep them healthy. They look really cute but they are not couch potatoes.\n\nI was ready to call you TA thinking you would judge her alone but it's clear that you really care about the dogs. So I'm gonna assume you're solely judging her by her dogs appearance.", "NTA.  I think maybe you could have worded it a little more delicately but you did the right thing for the puppy.  It's one thing to be obese but in my mind a morbidly obese person wouldn't be able to keep up with the demands of a young puppy (especially an aussie shepard).  I'm in shape and work out and I have days I'm exhausted trying to keep up with my English Setter pup, also an active breed.  The energy level is insane.  I think there's a dog out there for most everyone but in this case a young, active puppy and a morbidly obese person wouldn't be a good match. Again, I'm not fat shaming or fatphobic, it's just the reality of an active breed of dog.", "YTA, but not for rejecting the puppy sale. It was correct to do that, based on the dog's obesity. It was shitty to factor in the woman's obesity, though.", "YTA for breeding dogs.\nYTA for your delivery. I know plenty of overweight people with skinny dogs. The other dog may be older or have another reactor being overweight. You didn't investigate, but called off the sale because of her weight. Pretty disgusting.\n\nNTA for being picky in your sales.", "NTA for being picky with your clientele but the more professional thing to do as a business owner would have been to give her a PR friendly answer and send her on her way.", "NTA. I came in here fully ready to tell you you were, because you CAN'T tell how active a person is based on their size alone and some fat people are very active......but you didn't reject her based just on that. You rejected her based on the size of her dog which was absolutely the right thing to do. You're right that herding dogs are extremely active and hard to get to obesity. She is clearly not a good dog owner.", "NTA", "YTA. If you make assumptions about people\u2019s activity levels about size, you are not acting intelligently. If you truly cared about your dogs, you\u2019d ask what kind of activity they\u2019ll be getting, instead of assuming that skinny people are active and fat people aren\u2019t. I guarantee you\u2019ve met skinny people who are bone idle.", "YTA - did you ask her about her lifestyle? Or just make your own determinations and assume?  You made it about her personally, it was nothing but insulting. Keep it to the other dog's size next time. Wow.", "You could have been nicer in your response but this is the right decision for the dog. People can disagree but morbidly obese people don't have a healthy or active lifestyle.", "ESH. You are the asshole for bringing her weight into it. That alone isn\u2019t indicative of a bad dog owner. What is is the fact that her current dog is obese and doesn\u2019t seem to get enough exercise. You should have left it at just that. Also because you\u2019re a dog breeder.\n\nShe is the asshole too though for firstly not giving her current dog enough exercise and not recognizing that an Australian Shepard is a breed that needs a lot of activity.", "NTA - you\u2019re taking (*it seems*) great care of these dogs not only now but for their future as well. Maybe shouldn\u2019t have told her why, but oh well. Those are your standards & you were just being honest.", "YTA for saying it's because of her size, you should have just said it's due to her dogs size and that her dog doesn't look excersized..", "YTA\n\nNot for rejecting her application, but for this:\n\n>I was honest and told her that due to both her and her dogs size\n\nSERIOUSLY DUDE??? You did not have to be that specific with your answer. You really only had to say that you believed other people were better fits for the puppies' needs, and that would have done the job. Sarah is right. What you said does make you look fatphobic and it is not okay. Your response is what we like to call \"brutally honest\" (with a HUGE emphasis on the brutal part)", "Hmmm, ESH. \n\nYou should have only mentioned her dog being obese because indeed her being obese does not mean anything activity wise. Her dog being obese however means there is a problem either in his food or activity which is a red flag for a puppy.\n\nShe should not get an australian shepherd given that she managed to get a dog obese already. It's a disaster waiting to happen. And she also should have left you alone.", "YTA for making assumptions about *her* weight. Even when I was way overweight I was neurotic about my dog's health. His veterinarians have always complimented his weight. \n\nWhat her *dog's* weight is, however, completely appropriate. But you needn't have judged her by her own weight. When I went to adopt my dog, they did a home visit, and they called my family's vet to check on our care history. That's what you should do. See if the home is clean and safe, and call the vet. Maybe the dog has a thyroid issue, is on steroids, etc. That would point to her being a great pet parent.", "Ehhhhh NTA because her dog was overweight but next time pay more attention to someone\u2019s other dog\u2019s weight and not their weight as a person. Sometimes people are plenty active and eat right but have some sort of medical issue/are on medication that won\u2019t let them lose weight, so the owner\u2019s weight is not a good indication of how much exercise their dog gets/how much it\u2019s fed.", "YTA for not questioning her on it during the visit. It may be that she has plenty of exercise but also eats a lot - you could have asked her about her other dog\u2019s health, diet and exercise regimen and then rejected her for that if she couldn\u2019t explain why it was overweight which would have made it much less personal than rejecting her application based on a visual impression of her, herself.\n\nAs it was, you have no idea whether this is a permanent situation with her and the dog or whether for example she got injured and gained weight but is now exercising sufficiently to meet your pup\u2019s needs, so your rejection was shallow and not entirely evidence based.", "You certainly did not sugar coat it, and that very easily made a bad situation far worse.  Yeah, you made a judgement call, and used your observations to come to a conclusion that you did not believe the dogs would be as well taken care of.  The AH move here came in how you told her it was because of her size.\n\nESH, you could have left it at you had found another family you believed would be a better fit, but instead you chose to weaponize her weight against her.  She sucks here because she clearly DOES have an issue taking care of her current animal, and is using your words to tank your business.", "NTA, if she and her current dog are fatties you can bet the Aussie will be over fed and under exercised too.", "ESH\n\nYTA for being a backyard breeder and acting like you are morally superior. She sucks for supporting backyard breeding.", "NTA - your job is to take care of the puppies not the feelings of the woman. But tbh you could have done better", "NTA but jeez as I was reading your post, I audibly gasped/kind of laughed, when I got to the part that you told her that was why. So I think that will inevitably hurt your business at least a little but you have to gauge how well your business is doing vs how blunt you are with your customers.\n\n I probably would have just said there were other applicants who I thought were better fits and I have to make my best judgement for the dogs and left it at that.", "YTA and I'm highly surprised by all the posts saying you aren't. You are literally judging a book by its cover. You have no idea what the activity level of the woman or dog were. You saw them for a few minutes and made snap decisions about both of them and their lifestyles. People and animals can both be (relatively), healthy, active, and overweight, for various reasons. \n\nI will give you the perfect example. Two years ago my (stb ex) wife wanted to get a puppy. We searched all over and determined we wanted, you guessed it, an Australian Shepherd. She is 32, and she would be considered morbidly obese (over 300 lbs). We also have a son who was 5 at the time (he loves the dog and there were 100% no issues). Since the day we brought the dog home, she and the dog have always played and run outside, gone on walks, played a lot of fetch, and generally been fairly active. My ex has a highly underactive metabolism that prevents her from being \"skinny\" no matter how active she is or much she exercises (we have a lot of exercise equipment). She also used to have another dog that became overweight as it got older not due to being inactive, but just age and health reasons. \n\nI understand your desire to be selective with the pups you breed, and that is your choice and your right. But at the end of the day you are judging a book by its cover and essentially fat shaming a woman and her dog, and then proceeded to tell her to her face as the cherry on top. Regardless of this situation, your thought process and your handling of the situation shows how you really view people who are overweight, thus you are 100% an asshole. You could have potentially denied a puppy a good home and given it to a child abuser or any other thing. You just don't know who these people are. It's 100% your right to choose who you choose, but YTA for how you ultimately judged and viewed her as a person and for literally calling her fat to her face. How anyone here can say you aren't for that alone is just baffling, but clearly those people must be as fatphobic as you are.", "NTA - fat people always end up over feeding their animals too. That dog would be fat and unhealthy soon enough. She needs to redirect her anger into eating right and exercising", "NTA. Even for moderately active people I would say an Aussie Shepherd is a tough dog to own and train given that they are working dogs and need a ton of mental and physical stimulation.", "NTA. This is precisely what separates an ethical breeder (you) from a backyard breeder. I agree that that home was most likely unsuitable for your dog. Could you have worded it differently? Absolutely. But I suppose that\u2019s why you work with dogs and not people.", "You\u2019re NTA for wanting to prioritize the wellbeing of the puppy, but you handled this badly. Like, really badly.\n\nYou could\u2019ve \n\nA) declined to answer or engage with her after you rejected her application. Just say, \u201cdecisions are final.\u201d That\u2019s what I would\u2019ve done. It\u2019s not like you wanted her as a client going forward. If she really pressed you could\u2019ve\u2026\n\nB) said \u201cI matched each individual puppy to the home I felt would be the best fit based on my expertise. This is based on several factors, such as personality of the dog.\u201d If she was really pressing and wanted to get back on a waitlist or something, you could\u2019ve said:\n\nC) \u201cI noticed your dog was not in the best of health, especially considering its age. It\u2019s my responsibility to match my puppies to a home where they will receive the best care, and based on my interaction with your dog, I wasn\u2019t 100% certain this would be the case. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nYou did not need to bring up *her* weight at all. That\u2019s where I think you crossed a bit of a line. People can be overweight and active. People can be skinny and sedentary. The general poor health of her dog was the real concern here.\n\nWere you right? Yeah, maybe. But you can be right and still suffer for it based on how you handle it.", "Eh...\n\nNTA for rejecting the application due to her dog's obesity, but YTA for bringing up her size. If she had been obese but her dog had been a healthy weight, would you will have rejected the application? Your concern isn't her health, it's her potential dog's health. Someone can be obese and have a healthy pet. \n\nIn the future, I'd recommend abstaining from mentioning the client's weight and focus solely on the dog's health and welbeing.", "NTA for saying the owner has an obese dog. That's a valid reason because you know it will happen to this one. Plus, it's your dog. You don't have to give it to people for a myriad of reasons that don't have to be substantiated. \n\nI wouldn't have said it's because of the owner being fat, personally. The dog part was enough.", "NTA.\n\nI can't believe all these ytas.\n\nFor one, she asked why she was rejected. You don't get to ask a question and be offended at the answer you get. Two, there was already clear evidence that she is incapable of taking good care of one animal, let alone two. The dog she had with her was obese. That can lead to just as many problems in dogs and humans, especially with a breed as active as OP was selling.", "NTA", "YTA, you should have based it on the dogs bad health, not the woman's. You called her morbidly obese but you are not a doctor to diagnose her with that.", "This a repost. I saw this lost last year. Which is sad that I remember and means I spend too much time on this site.", "I would have not mentioned her weight but mentioned that you noticed that the dog was obsese and question her on its diet and that you have concerns about how she would feed it. It is not right to assume that obese people never exercise. A lot do and the weight stays on with no fault to them. Maybe they have a thyroid issue.", "YTA. \n\n\nHer other dog was all you needed to mention, the rest is you being a jerk. As dog owners we have 100% control over our dogs, im fat, my dogs are at a perfect weight, very healthy, happy, and active.", "YTA. making assumptions is what got you into this mess. you should have asked more questions to the woman herself, ask her for proof that his other dog is being well taken care of. if they have someone else's help, ask her if she really could handle all the extra care big dogs need. all this could've been avoided if you didn't made your decision based on your bias.", "YTA slightly because I agree with you. I\u2019ve seen this breed turn into absolute monsters when not cared for properly. \n\nBut, you should have left it at \u201cI just don\u2019t believe you\u2019d be a good fit\u201d and left it at that. \n\nPeople love to assume they\u2019re capable before they get the dog and then give up on them when they realize they can\u2019t do it. \n\nI\u2019ve got two huskies from people that couldn\u2019t keep up with their energy demands. My girl if she doesn\u2019t get enough energy out she\u2019s eating a bed. So, guess who\u2019s walking them 5-6 miles a day. There\u2019s more damage there to be undone. But, eh it takes a lot of time and effort to work bad behaviors out of a dog.", "NTA\n\nYou saved a puppy from being overfed, underexersized and probably from being posted to r/chonkers for reddit karma.", "NTA - I wouldn't say obesity should be an automatic no, but you saw the condition of her other dog and that shows that it won't be exercised enough.", "Nta. But you should only talk about her dog being obese. There is no need to talk about her size. Her dog beeing overweight is a good enough reason.", "YTA.\n\nThe second you made a decision based on a person's size you fucked up. You could've easily stated that the reasons of rejection was due to her first dogs health and nothing more. That your dogs require a strict diet and activity schedule plus routine vet appointments. And that the appearance of her dog led her to the assumption that this may not be viable so you went with a family that met your strict requirements.\n\nYou should've left her out of it entirely. Cause now she has legit ammo against you for discrimination.", "YTA, and the fatphobic comments of this post are also gross and you\u2019re assholes too. \nThere was no reason to say it was her size that made you say no. People are fat for many different reasons, not just overeating and/or lack of exercise. If the weight of her current dog was the reason, leave it at that! You didn\u2019t have to say it was her.", "NTA you did right it\u2019s actually animal abuse to let a dog be obese!", "YTA. I have two dogs. Ones over weight and one is lean.  The lean one likes to run etc. the other one does not.  You should have asked how she was going to make sure the dogs was going to be adequately exercised.", "INFO: did you ask about her activity level or any health conditions her dog might have had, or did you just assume because they were larger?\n\nETA: typo", "I wouldn't have called her obese. Just point out that unfortunately we cannot accept your application due to health concerns. Can you explain why your other dog is obese? \n\nAnd go from there.\n\nNTA for rejecting", "Nta. Ive bred snakes before so i know what its like to want your animals to go to a good home. I would make sure every part of the care was taken care of and set up before the snake was purchased. If i didnt have a pic of the setup, no snake. I didnt care how upset people got. I understand this situation is different because i withheld the animals for a non controversial reason but the point still stands that the overall quality of life of thr animal always supersedes a human\u2019s emotions. Good for you for sticking by your animals", "NTA I have two border collies and they need exercise. Simple. You did what was best for the dog.", "YTA for telling her the truth. You did reject her for being fat and her dog also being fat.  But you shouldn't have told her this. Lying would have been better.", "Yikes, dude. There was no reason you couldn\u2019t have said \u201cwe had more applicants than puppies and I felt that the other homes were a better fit. Best of luck finding your next fur-buddy!\u201d It genuinely could have been that simple and still honest. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to vote, I\u2019m leaning YTA just because you chose the nuclear option for no legitimate reason. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA\n\nI honestly don't know how you manage to get any of them homed", "YTA- you don't know why the other dog was obese and you don't know what activity level she can give a dog. I have 4 catahoulas which are high energy farm and hunting dogs but I'm also obese. Very obese. I have 1 obese catahoula, why? I don't know. She eats the same amount as the other dogs and every day they all run together. My one catahoula who is 10 actually began losing weight when we started going on walks around my new farm but the one that is overweight hasn't lost a pound. It doesn't affect her, the vet said she's healthy but needs to lose some weight but even he agreed that with the amount and food I'm feeding her and her activity level she shouldn't be overweight.  So really you could have just said you didn't have any more puppies available but instead you were rude and discriminated against her because she is fat.", "YTA. Your business is suffering because you rejected her based on her size and thinking she doesn\u2019t do any activity. I\u2019m sure you made the right decision for the dog but you should have given her another reason for rejecting her. Good luck.", "NTA, but wow you could have handled that much more tactfully. The obese poodle was absolutely a valid enough red flag and really all that had to be shared that it indicated she wouldn't give your pup enough activity for the breed.", "YTA.  I think you at least should have explained what this breed needs and asked questions like does she take her dogs to parks, how many walks per day, does she only leave the dog in the yard and not have other play time etc.  It's possible for her to take dogs to an enclosed park where they can have active play time while she herself isn't active.  And like others have said, you don't know what was going on with her other dog and apparently didn't ask. Could be that the dog is too sedentary and/or overfed, but could also be a medical issue etc.", "ESH. I admire you for ensuring your pups go to good homes. More breeders should be invested in the future welfare of the dogs that they help bring into the world.

This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed. This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\n\n\nThis happened recently, and I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m in the wrong.\n\nFor context, I (26M) am a dog breeder. I breed Australian Shepherds, and I take pride in knowing all of my dogs are healthy and go to loving homes. A few months ago, one of my bitches had a litter of 5. After a few weeks I began to go through the process of finding each puppy a home.\n\nI have very high standards for the homes I send my puppies to. If I even have a hunch that this may not be a perfect fit, I will reject an application. For example, I do not accept homes with children under 8, because of the concern of tail/ear pulling, etc.,\n\nOne day, I get an application from a woman I\u2019ll call Sarah(F32). Decent income, no kids, remote job, another dog, decent house with a fenced backyard, willing family nearby to take the dog in case of emergency. All good things. So, I accept her request for a visit (being accepted for a visit \u2260 accepted to take home a dog. It\u2019s a good sign, but not set in stone.)\n\nWhen Sarah arrives, I immediately notice two things. One, she is morbidly obese. Two, her dog (who she brought to meet the other puppy she was interested in) is also obese.\n\nAustralian Shepherds are extremely active. I mean, they\u2019re cattle dogs. They *need* activity. Sarah didn\u2019t look very active, and her dog didn\u2019t either. It\u2019s not easy to get a dog to obesity if it is being fed a decent diet and is active. (This wasn\u2019t a tiny dog, either. If I had to guess, I\u2019d say it was a mid-sized poodle)\n\nSo, I decided to send to reject Sarah\u2019s application. All of the puppy\u2019s went to the homes that I believe were best for them. However, Sarah called me up, and asked why I rejected her application. I was honest and told her that due to both her and her dogs size, I did not believe that the puppy would get adequate exercise.\n\nShe didn\u2019t like that. She began getting agitated, asking why I believed that fat people could not be active and claiming I was discriminating due to her size. She hung up with her final statements being something along the line of \u201cKarma will come for you, fatphobic fuck!\u201d\n\nSarah has since been blasting my business on pretty much every social media platform, and I believe my business has been suffering. I refuse to back down or apologize because I truly believe I did what was right for that dog. However, I can understand how my judgement may be insulting.\n\nSo, AITA for rejecting a woman\u2019s dog adoption application based on her size?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA if it was based on the dog's size. I can see your concern.

I got a dog to help motivate me to lose weight, and it's working. I'm down 65 lbs from my highest weight. It is coming off slow and healthy. My dog is fit as hell. A number of his siblings are already overweight, and their owners are fit people. I want to highlight: **I am morbidly obese and my dog is healthier than his siblings who are owned by fit people.** My dog has his own fitness tracker. We go on two hour-long walks twice a day. I do light obedience training at least once a day, usually just using his kibble at meal time. \n\nA few other things I want you to think about:\n\n* The majority of fat dogs I know are owned by thin people. I guarantee you at least one of the puppies you sold to a thin person is going to end up fat and under-exercised.\n* I see a lot of fat people with fit dogs.\n* An Australian Shepherd puppy that does not get enough exercise will drive someone absolutely freaking insane before it gets the chance to get fat. There is no worse and immediate punishment for a human than an under-exercised dog. \n* Unless you know her history or her dog's history, you really have no idea how/when/why they're obese. Yes, most people and animals are obese purely because of excess calories. But maybe she lost her husband or child three years ago and ate her feelings for three years and is now coming out of her shell. Or maybe she adopted the dog last year and it came to her even heavier than it is now, and she's helping it slowly lose weight. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, you have the right to sell your puppies to who you want to, but at the end of the day unless you're checking out every home for safety issues and meeting every single household member to make sure all adults and older kids know how to care for a herding dog, you're not really protecting your puppies.

I wouldn't adopt out a dog to someone who has an contributed to making a pet obese but I would ask questions to determine if they are rehabbing the dog vs. just over feeding. As if they are actively working on getting the pup back to a proper size I wouldn't let an obese dog stop an adoption.", "We don\u2019t know what this woman looked like or weighed, nor should it matter.

He just saw that the woman was fat and denied her application. Now, as I said, the health of *the other dog* she brought was a totally fair indication that she would not properly care for the puppy. There may be a strong correlation between an owner\u2019s obesity and the health of their dogs, I don\u2019t know, but that\u2019s not enough.
