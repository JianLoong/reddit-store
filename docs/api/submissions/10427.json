And OP needs to stop being a doormat. And what kind of person does not replace all the food them and their friends have eaten considering that they\u2019re not live in tenants? Yeah kick her entitled butt to the curb or better yet tell the landlord. Because I\u2019m pretty sure having someone there that\u2019s not even on the lease is breaking some tenant laws.", "You're NTA. She is a taker, and she finally learned what happens when she takes too much. You were already extremely tolerant of her continued, mostly unpaid for presence.", "I would change the locks", "NTA. People not on the lease shouldn\u2019t have keys and other privileges that are usually reserved for the people who live there, like inviting their friends over for movie night.", "NTA. Get a mini fridge and put food you buy there. Don't combine grocery with your roommate (if you were doing that before). She should not freeload off you.", ">because she said it was not her responsibility to buy groceries for the house when she was not on the lease\n\nI fail to follow her logic.

Not sure I'd let her back in.", "Ah. Boundaries!! Finally!", "NTA. She's a mooch", "NTA, but here's a hard truth:  your \"conflict aversion\" which has translated into a lack of boundaries has led this woman to take advantage of you in every possible way.  You might think you are just being chill, or being kind to your (32m) roommate, but some people (like this woman) will bulldoze right over people who don't have strong boundaries.\n\nIn the future, draw some lines. Don't let people live with you if they don't pay rent. Don't let people have keys if they don't pay rent.  Don't let people who are not on the lease have parties in your apartment.", "NTA Vagina you are not even using will not  over 5 people.", "Sorry, ESH:\nThe girlfriend for behaving as if it were her home and pantry without paying rent/utilities, not contributing to groceries on a regular basis and for not restocking the food she and her friends used without bothering to ask if they could use it in the first place. \nThe roommate for enabling this behaviour.\nOP too, if only for not talking to the girlfriend but to her boyfriend. This is the 21. century, man. You got a problem with a woman, you talk to that woman. Apart from that, you're not TA.", "He was at work, might I add he had no idea about the party", "According to him, he told her how I felt about the situatation and she lashed out. They were arguing when I came home from work and then when I came inside she turned the argument to me. He agrees with me, and she's threatening to leave him if he doesn't figure it out.", "My roommate and i split all bills 50/50. she contributes to buying food sometimes but usually only stuff for her and my roommate. She's covered our water bill once when i was out of work and my roommate was out of town, even offered it, i didn't even ask. that is why this situation is so crazy to me", "This comment is disgusting", "I only talked to him because his gf and I don't really have a relationship. We barely talk when she's there and if we communicate it's usually through him. I also figured if it came from him it maybe she would take it easier bc i was trying to avoid what happened. Honestly, maybe I should've talked to her directly instead but i felt like since we already don't talk it would be an easier conversation if it came from him", ">. You got a problem with a woman, you talk to that woman. Apart from that, you're not TA. \n\nWhatt are you talking about? If you have a problem with your roommates partner who doesn't pay any bills you talk to your roommate first. Gender doesn't matter here you weirdo.", "More the reason to demand the key back. She should have done it at her place. The reason she didn't was because she had no money.", "Dude, that is even worse. \n\nShe definitely should be banned from the apartment, or at the very least not allowed over until she replaces what she used of yours. Even then she shouldne be allowed over or stay in the morning unless your roommate is there.", "So she is taking this out on him whilst it is between the two of you?\n\nIt's not like he is particularly not allowing her inside of the house, you are. \n\nThis makes no sense to me.\nIf talking it out doesn't work then clearly she doesn't want to listen and just wants to freeload off of the food in your fridge. She is now threatening her boyfriend with leaving him if she can't get what she wants? Which conveniently is eating all the food you paid for. \nI don't know but you don't threaten breaking up with your boyfriend over a silly thing like this if you truly love him.\n\nIf I try putting myself in her situation (which isn't easy tbh) I can't even IMAGINE putting the blame on my boyfriend and threatening a breakup. I would lose the person I love over not being able to communicate.", "You pay 50%? \n\nSo first up, every night with a key throwing parties means she lives there. YOU, my friend are subsidizing her life. \n\n\nRent issues aside, If, for example, an electric bill is 100$ you as one person pay 50$ but three people are using up 100$ of electricity, soooo NOPE! \n\nSTOP THIS. Plus eating your food and then getting nasty at you? She says YOU want to use HER for \u201cfree food? SERIOUSLY? She is not your girlfriend, thank goodness. \n\nThese are some serious worries!! You need to have a real conversation with your roommate. NTA", "And also doesn't make any sense.", "Don't get me wrong, I can see where you're coming from. But apart from the paternalistic aspect, triangulation - communicating with person A via person B - never works out like intended and more often than not creates even more difficulties. Especially if you're not close to person A but are to person B.", "She sounds nuts! I feel bad for your roommate. He should not stay with someone who treats him this way.", "Get a grip and kick her out for good. NTA", "If she's been staying every night, maybe she doesn't have her own place anymore.", "And no food to feed her friends....", "She told him that he is disrespecting her by taking my side in the situation and she, and I quote \"cannot be with someone who will not stick up for her when she didn't do anything wrong\"", "Oh and maybe don't allow her to bring friends unless she plans it beforehand whilst making sure all 3 of you know about it. Or just don't allow that anymore. \n\nI think if the 3 of you sit down and set some boundaries things could work out tbh", "Yeah, that is gaslighting. instead of trying to talk and try to figure it out she is looking away from the problem and making it into a different thing.\n\nI myself think this way: \"I will always take my boyfriend's side, unless I believe he's wrong and then we will talk about it until we find middle ground or agree with one another\". Nothing wrong with having a good conversation and learning from one another.\n\nIf she's not willing to do that then it's not going to work out.\n\nI believe you might have to try to sit down one more time with all 3 of you and have a serious conversation about this.\n\nFor example explain that she is allowed to stay but she will have to buy her own food from now on and if she eats any of your food again, she is out. \n\nSomething along the lines of giving her a second chance might work."]}
