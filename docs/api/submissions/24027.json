I'll try to be as impartial as possible.\n\nI've been living in Hungary for the few years, and I'm visiting my family in the USA now, along with friends. I've been here for about three weeks.\n\nA friend of mine heard I was in town and drove 6 or 7 hours to come see me. He also organized a big party for me and invited a lot of old friends to come, and I'd love to see them all as I haven't seen them in three years either.\n\nHowever, my little cousins decided they would come over and see me. They didn't ask me, only my mom and their parents, who agreed. They asked the night before the party, even though the party has been planned for about a week now.\n\nNow, to give some additional context, I actually saw them quite a bit during my time here. We had a giant family reunion where I basically spent an entire weekend with them, and they also took another day of my time when they showed up complete unannounced (I had to cancel plans with another friend for that too).\n\nWhile one of my cousins is fine, and I love my uncle, the other one is also a spoiled brat that I cannot stand to be around. During the reunion he would sneak alcohol, pound on a piano, blow on his saxophone, invite his friend over to other people's airBNBs without asking them, harassed someone in our family about their eating issue, etc. I could go on. Needless to say I'm not exactly keen on seeing him. The other I wouldn't mind, per se, if it wasn't for rhe fact my friend did all of this for me.\n\nNow, my family is saying I should either cancel the party, or leave after an hour or two to come see them. My mother in particular insists she is right. I don't really have anyone on my side, but I don't want to leave so early. For One, I want to be there and chat with all of my old friends, two, they already took one a away with my friends when they pulled a similar stunt, and lastly, I've already spent so much time with them, and it wasnt great.\n\nSo, am I the asshole? If here's any additional questions I'd be glad to answer.", "created_utc": 1691338989, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15jtopj/aitah_for_not_cancelling_party_plans_to_see_my/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They insist I do cancel to see my little cousins, even though I've already spent time with them a lot, and they showed up unannounced before and forced me to cancel plans. My family is insisting I'm the bad guy for not cancelling, but I feel justified because I haven't seen my friends in forever, and they knew about this a week in advance.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ### [Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your time is limited. Do what will make you happy.\n\nAs for them...\n\n>They didn't ask me... They asked the night before the party, even though the party has been planned for about a week now.\n\nYou've already been here for three weeks and they have to come on the exact day you're busy and already have plans? To hell with that. \n\nThe expectation that you drop everything to accommodate the last minute plans of people who didn't even actually make plans with you is fucking rude. \n\n>My mother in particular insists she is right.\n\nThey tend to do that, but it doesn't actually matter. Everyone thinks they're right. It has no bearing on if they're actually right. Remove it entirely as a factor in your decision making. IMO she wants to save face and not have the world notice that she overstepped by making plans for you without consulting you. She's putting avoiding embarrassment over her mistake over your happiness and well-being. That's a shitty thing to do.", "NTA - there\u2019s no law saying you have to hang out with anybody in particular", "NTA. Your parent's don't have any right to be forcing them upon you or think they are entitled to all your time. Your friend is trying to do something for you which you planned long before the cousin situation. Your parents should have spoken to you first to check it was okay and accepted your NO because you had made plans!\n\nYour mother isn't as courtesy would have been to contact you first before she agreed!", "NTA. They dont respect your time or plans. Probably just trying to push watching them onto you since they made other plans", "Definitely NTA, you've had these plans for a week and they decided, without even asking you, that they want to see you. Just because they're family doesn't mean you have to put them above everyone else especially when you don't even like one of them. \n\nDon't let them ruin your fun or limit your time, if it was me I would be extra petty and stay out as long as I could and make even more plans. It's like they expect you to only be out there for them when it's not the case and they need to learn common courtesy; Call before you just show up. \n\nIt's on them if they decide to come over unannounced and you decide to go out, and don't invite them to come with you either.", "NTA. They didn\u2019t consult you, and you already have other plans. It\u2019s unfair for them to try and monopolize your time and you shouldn\u2019t be made to feel guilty about sticking to your original plan.\n\nRemind your family that cancelling or leaving the party early would be extremely disrespectful to all the people who made time to attend, especially the friend who drove 6+ hours and made the effort to organize everything.", "\"Oh, what a shame! It's too bad that you didn't check with me first so we could have found a time that was mutually acceptable...next time, make sure to do that. Obviously, it's impossible for me to go back on a commitment I made to other people, and I'm sure you aren't trying to say that I should do that: after all, I'm sure *family* would never treat me so poorly to ask me to go back on my word to other people. After all, that would mean that people from our family are liars who don't honor their commitments and are generally untrustworthy.\"\n\nNTA. In general, you have no obligation to cancel pre-existing plans for anything besides a true emergency. Hanging out with your cousins (regardless of how much you like or dislike them) is not an emergency. And even if you *didn't* have pre-existing plans, you are not obligated to spend time with people you don't like or respect.\n\nBTW, I saw one of the comments you made about what your mother is saying to you and she's being totally ridiculous.", "Of course NTA. You have plans that evening which would be very rude to cancel or cut short. Stick to your guns.", "NTA.\n\nYou've already made plans. It would actually be a bit rude, at least in my opinion, to cancel the party or leave early. You haven't seen your friends in 3 years. I'm sure some of them are giving up their own time to organize this party for you. You've already spent time with cousins. Go enjoy yourself with friends. Its one night, your family should be more understanding.", "The party your friends is having is for YOU.  If you leave after an hour or two you will be insulting all your friends\n\nYour parents should have asked about your plans, and maybe you should have informed your parents that  you had plans for the evening when it was formalized with your friend.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Doesn't sound like you would enjoy seeing your cousins much anyway.", "Yeah the second paragraph makes a lot of sense, thank you. Yeah, I think one of the things that provoked me into posting here is her insistence that I'm treating my family poorly for this and that I'll \"lose my family\" if I keep this up. \nMy aunt I haven't heard from, I'm not a fan of her either, but she's done stuff like this before (she's the one who dropped them off the first time they just showed up). I don't want everyone in my family to think I'm a dick for not seeing my cousins, but I have a feeling that's the story that's going to get around", "One minor incident won't change their whole opinion of you. People might be mad in the moment. People might remember. It's still not a big deal. \n\nThis one thing isn't going to make you \"lose your family\" or be thought of as a dick by everyone. \n\nIf it's really stressing you out, make sure a few key people in the family know what actually happened. Word will spread around.", "The trick is to get ahead of the story. To family \u201cI wish that I could have seen my cousins but they came without warning on a day that I had plans with friends. It\u2019s really a shame that They didn\u2019t value my presence enough to check if I was available.\u201d \n\nWhat *would* be rude would be to not go to the party that your friends planned or to only show up for a short period of time."]}
