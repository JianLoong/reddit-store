We are a family of 5. I make sure dinner is served before my boyfriend comes home at 5pm. Because I know he is always starving from working hard and providing for our family. So when it comes to dinner I am always the last to eat. After serving everyone and making sure everyone has their juice and whatever else they may need. As a result, I\u2019m usually the last to sit and enjoy my meal. Well this day was no different. I made Chinese food: fried rice, orange chicken, walnut prawns and my all time favorite egg rolls. I served everyone. I took meds to settle my stomach and sat down to wait for it work. \n\nI made my boyfriends plate stacked with rice and pleanty of egg rolls. When he got his plate he immediately asked if there was enough for seconds. I explained to him that I hadn\u2019t eaten yet and that there may be some left over after I serve myself up a plate. There wasn\u2019t much left, there was a spoon full of rice left and extra egg rolls (I made extra because they are my fav) \n\nI sat down on the couch an conversed with my boyfriend about his day. I watched as he polished off his food. He got up to take his plate to the kitchen. Came back chewing. I didn\u2019t honk anything of it. He tends to eat the scraps off of our children\u2019s plate so I thought nothing of it. He got up a few more time still munching and came back with a beverage. \n\nAgain, I have not eaten because I\u2019m waiting for my meds to kick in. 20min has passed, and my stomach is ready for the food I just spent hours making. I go in the kitchen and all of my egg rolls are gone. I was immediately upset. I told him I hadn\u2019t eaten. Told him not to touch the food until after I ate. \n\nWhen I confronted him he said \u201ceat the ones off the kids plate\u201d like WTF! I cooked and served everyone and this is how I\u2019m treated. He then offered to make me more and I declined as these are not store brought ready made egg rolls these are from scratch rolled up and then fried egg rolls. So no he couldn\u2019t make me anymore. \n\nTo make a long story short. I didn\u2019t eat I was pissed I went to bed hungry. No apology nothing. Am I the asshole for still being angry 2days later? I\u2019ve also boycotted cooking & anything related to my SAHM duties.", "created_utc": 1691943728, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15q34dg/aita_for_getting_angry_because_my_boyfriend_ate/", "score": 126, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not okay under any circumstances, that was disgusting.\n\nHe showed you who he values, it\u2019s not you.", "NTA. I agree with previous comments suggesting you \n\nA) take your meds while preparing dinner so you can eat with all of them. \n\nB) set aside a plate for yourself in the oven if you forget to take your meds while preparing the meal\n\nC) have a conversation with him about helping out and being more respectful of you eating. Be sure you show appreciation for him providing for the family but that gives him no right to neglect your needs. \n\nI do think if you\u2019re still angry two days later, you need to figure out what the true issue is. I doubt it\u2019s just this event. Has he done this before or done other things that leave you feeling disrespected and neglected?", "NTA, but a good consequence is that you all eat together, meaning that if you have spent hours cooking the food then your family can wait for twenty minutes before eating. Cite broken trust as the reason when he grumbles about having to wait. It's incredibly also disrespectful that anyone starts eating before the chef has sat down.", "NTA for being mad at his behavior.\n\nHowever, you punished yourself. Somehow thinking that depriving yourself because he ate your dinner just caused you pain. BF doesn't care that you went to bed hungry. \n\nStop thinking of your contributions to your home as \"duties\".  You have a **job** and your coworker is slacking off.", "NTA, your boyfriend is. He owes you an apology & he should also probably cook meals occasionally. I get that you're  a SAHM and he works, so it's more your job than his, but parenting kids is a 24/7 job already. It wouldn't kill him to cook one day a week.", "I am an asshole for being passive aggressive. \nFor context:\n\u2014 My meds are taken as needed when symptoms present themselves. (Out of my control)\n\u2014 I could\u2019ve put away a plate for myself, but If I CLEARLY gave instructions (as an adult) he should\u2019ve listened and followed directions. I should not have to hide food just so I can eat in my own house. \n\u2014 no children were harmed/deprived of food. They ate out instead. \n\u2014 I did not set myself up. He saw there was little to no food left. So he should\u2019ve left it alone \n\u2014 I cooked more than enough food.", "NTA. Next time, make yourself a plate and put it in the oven out of view", "NTA. That was appalling of him. Make him cook and serve himself last and see how he likes it. Suggestion: Always make yourself a plate and tuck it away -- don't wait for your meds to kick it. If he isn't going to make you a priority above his apatite, make yourself a priority. Whether you want to wait until everyone else has been served or before you even give them theirs is your choice.", "NTA but this should be a good sign for you to plan the dinner better to suit you all, including yourself. \n\nIs there a way to take your medication earlier so you may join them and eat at the same time, thus plating up for yourself? \n\nIf not, you should serve up your plate first and store it in the oven or something to keep it warm. Designate a \"leftovers area\" by the fridge etc so no ambiguity exists. \n\nNot the end of the world though, I'd suggest getting him to buy dinner for you as an apology, or make it himself if he can cook any bit decently.", "NTA and there's a solution: when you can't eat right away, build up your plate and set it aside. Then the leftovers are obvious. If he wants to eat the scraps from the kids' plates that's his choice but you do deserve your own plate. He was an AH for knowingly taking your food.", "NTA. He knew you hadn\u2019t eaten yet and didn\u2019t care.\n\nLots of people in the comments are suggesting that you should have set aside a plate for yourself, but you shouldn\u2019t have to do that. He should be considerate enough to wait, or make himself something else if he\u2019s still hungry.", "NTA--Your boyfriend may be an asshole, or he may just not see the difference between homemade, lovingly-prepared eggrolls, and frozen stuff from the grocery store.  You can explain it to him, but there's no guarantee he'll get it or value your effort.  Save the homemade stuff for you and the kids and defrost something for him.", "You SAH without being married? Risky business sister. And plate your food at the same time as everyone else\u2019s so you are sure you have enough. . You deserve to eat with your family, take your meds while you\u2019re cooking. It\u2019s weird and unnecessary that you\u2019re not eating until 20 minutes after everyone else. ESH but the whole dynamic is weird on both of your ends.", "NTA. Do your meds make you dizzy, sleepy? I ask this is why you wait until you are done cooking to take the medicine. I take Zofran for nausea and those are side effects. \n\nYour bf is awful to eat food meant for you and then expect you to take food out of your children's mouths. That is a greedy ah. Does he care for you at all?", "NTA. In the moment. \n\nBut to still be pissed about it two days later is ridiculous. Use your words and have a conversation with him about how his actions made you feel. Stewing about something for so long hurts only yourself. \n\nAlso, why go to bed hungry? With that many people in the house, I doubt there was not one single other item you could eat.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Then, have a serious conversation about how cruel and fundamentally unacceptable his behaviour was.\n\nJust because he works outside of the home doesn't mean that he gets to steal your food. Your job never stops. You job makes his life easier. And he wants to treat you like that? Nope. He knew what he was doing. He actively chose to value his comfort over your need for food.

Besides steal your food? At the very least, he needs to centre your needs first for a bit.
