As a result, I\u2019m usually the last to sit and enjoy my meal. Well this day was no different. I made Chinese food: fried rice, orange chicken, walnut prawns and my all time favorite egg rolls. I served everyone. I took meds to settle my stomach and sat down to wait for it work. \n\nI made my boyfriends plate stacked with rice and pleanty of egg rolls. When he got his plate he immediately asked if there was enough for seconds. I explained to him that I hadn\u2019t eaten yet and that there may be some left over after I serve myself up a plate. There wasn\u2019t much left, there was a spoon full of rice left and extra egg rolls (I made extra because they are my fav) \n\nI sat down on the couch an conversed with my boyfriend about his day.

Not okay under any circumstances, that was disgusting.\n\nHe showed you who he values, it\u2019s not you.", "NTA. I agree with previous comments suggesting you \n\nA) take your meds while preparing dinner so you can eat with all of them. \n\nB) set aside a plate for yourself in the oven if you forget to take your meds while preparing the meal\n\nC) have a conversation with him about helping out and being more respectful of you eating.

It's incredibly also disrespectful that anyone starts eating before the chef has sat down.", "NTA for being mad at his behavior.\n\nHowever, you punished yourself.

He owes you an apology & he should also probably cook meals occasionally. I get that you're  a SAHM and he works, so it's more your job than his, but parenting kids is a 24/7 job already.

I should not have to hide food just so I can eat in my own house. \n\u2014 no children were harmed/deprived of food. They ate out instead. \n\u2014 I did not set myself up.

Suggestion: Always make yourself a plate and tuck it away -- don't wait for your meds to kick it. If he isn't going to make you a priority above his apatite, make yourself a priority. Whether you want to wait until everyone else has been served or before you even give them theirs is your choice.", "NTA but this should be a good sign for you to plan the dinner better to suit you all, including yourself. \n\nIs there a way to take your medication earlier so you may join them and eat at the same time, thus plating up for yourself? \n\nIf not, you should serve up your plate first and store it in the oven or something to keep it warm.

Risky business sister. And plate your food at the same time as everyone else\u2019s so you are sure you have enough. . You deserve to eat with your family, take your meds while you\u2019re cooking.

I ask this is why you wait until you are done cooking to take the medicine. I take Zofran for nausea and those are side effects. \n\nYour bf is awful to eat food meant for you and then expect you to take food out of your children's mouths. That is a greedy ah. Does he care for you at all?", "NTA. In the moment. \n\nBut to still be pissed about it two days later is ridiculous. Use your words and have a conversation with him about how his actions made you feel. Stewing about something for so long hurts only yourself. \n\nAlso, why go to bed hungry?

My niece (11, not a baby) is so sweet, and would go set her plate down on the table and bring mine to me, so I could dish myself some food before we all sat down to eat. When their parents got home from dealing with the emergency, they served themselves from the leftovers (I always made enough, of course!), because they are adults.
