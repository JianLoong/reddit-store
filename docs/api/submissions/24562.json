As a result, I\u2019m usually the last to sit and enjoy my meal. Well this day was no different. I made Chinese food: fried rice, orange chicken, walnut prawns and my all time favorite egg rolls.

There wasn\u2019t much left, there was a spoon full of rice left and extra egg rolls (I made extra because they are my fav) \n\nI sat down on the couch an conversed with my boyfriend about his day.

It's incredibly also disrespectful that anyone starts eating before the chef has sat down.", "NTA for being mad at his behavior.\n\nHowever, you punished yourself.

He owes you an apology & he should also probably cook meals occasionally. I get that you're  a SAHM and he works, so it's more your job than his, but parenting kids is a 24/7 job already.

I should not have to hide food just so I can eat in my own house. \n\u2014 no children were harmed/deprived of food. They ate out instead. \n\u2014 I did not set myself up.

Whether you want to wait until everyone else has been served or before you even give them theirs is your choice.", "NTA but this should be a good sign for you to plan the dinner better to suit you all, including yourself. \n\nIs there a way to take your medication earlier so you may join them and eat at the same time, thus plating up for yourself? \n\nIf not, you should serve up your plate first and store it in the oven or something to keep it warm.

I ask this is why you wait until you are done cooking to take the medicine. I take Zofran for nausea and those are side effects. \n\nYour bf is awful to eat food meant for you and then expect you to take food out of your children's mouths. That is a greedy ah. Does he care for you at all?", "NTA. In the moment. \n\nBut to still be pissed about it two days later is ridiculous. Use your words and have a conversation with him about how his actions made you feel. Stewing about something for so long hurts only yourself. \n\nAlso, why go to bed hungry?

If he was still hungry why couldn't he make a quick sandwich and not take your share of food? Is he always selfish like this?", "ESH. Your husband is the bigger AH and it\u2019s appalling how he acted in this situation but I was shaking my head and raising my eyebrows at you too. You need to do better for yourself. Eat your meds to settle your stomach earlier so you can eat food when it\u2019s ready. Why are you cooking for 3 hours and then not eating a damn thing while you witness your ravenous husband eating everything in his path. You\u2019re snoozing and losing. You just sound kind of like a sort of victim-complex martyr. Just meet your needs. You can\u2019t meet anyone else\u2019s needs if your needs have not been met first. Stop punishing yourself and refraining from sitting down and eating. Eat when food is ready.", "Why are you with that?", "Also, unless the kids are  young, nobody needs to be served. OP should sit and eat with the kids and husband. \n\nAlso, he was greedy, he knew there were no more egg rolls and given he is your bf, he might be aware you really like the rolls and ate it anyway. An AH move.\n\nNTA.", "[removed]", "As the primary chef i make my plate first. Hubs can get his own but i serve up the kids and if i make mine first then im always guaranteed food. Hubs does the same when he cooks. The chef shouldnt go to bed hungry. NTA op but you need to actually talk to him. He cant apologize if he doesnt realize he hurt you.", "And why do you serve him? You are not his waitress, he can get his food himself. (But set aside a plate for you.)", "Exactly. You are not in charge of his self control.", "This is essentially the problem with serving yourself last. The whole first half of your post is an ode to how you serve your family and how you put their needs above your own.... Welp this is what happens when you downplay your own needs and set yourself on fire to keep others warm. You get taken for granted.", "NTA\n\nIs he this selfish regularly? Is he this selfish just about food, or is he selfish about lots of stuff? Does he hold it over you that he makes the money, and you don\u2019t? What kind of dad is he to your children? He\u2019s for sure the A H for eating your food. Like, WTF! I\u2019m just curious if he\u2019s an ah on a regular basis.", "I would be pissed as well. I would absolutely just cook for myself and the kids. So as long as you aren\u2019t boycotting caring for them NTA until you get a legitimate apology and he takes you out to dinner.", "\"He saw there was little to no food left\" - then you didn't cook enough. You said yourself you barely had a spoonful of rice left. He's a giant asshole for doing this, but you are a bit of an asshole to yourself for going above and beyond in making this meal, serving him, and then leaving very little of it to yourself (even if he had not stolen your food, you sad yourself there was not much left) and you state that you always eat after everyone else.\n\nYou deserve to eat too. You deserve to eat as much as him and the kids, not just eat scrappy leftovers. I understand you are angry with him, but it also sounds like you have a habit of putting yourself last, that you should work on. \n\nIn a family, you should eat together. Him and the kids can wait until you are all seated, so you eat WITH them, not after them like some live-in maid.\n\nI make 99 percent of our meals/dinners, but I always eat at the same time as my husband and child, at the table, with them. I would not agree to eat after everyone else was finished.", "Dump him.

I don't know how old the kids are but she should plate all the dinners and sit down with them, kids can get their own juice, lay the table, and help out while OP is plating up. Sounds a little bit of a martyr.", "Not a big enough table.", "4,6,and 10", "He is the father of all 3", "I would\u2019ve had to teach him.

He probably has no idea.", "Because in a healthy relationship you don\u2019t stay mad at your partner for 2 days for what he did.", "Sadly, it sounds like she hast to portion it out so everyone eats, but if he\u2019s earning enough to take care of five people in what sounds like a physically demanding job, I think it\u2019s totally fair for him to come home to a plate of food and have an hour to relax", "I mean not when you're close to reasonable people who can follow simple instructions,  no.", "\u201cYou didn\u2019t cook enough\u201d ignores the fact that many people only have so much food and have to ration it out if they want to be able to eat everyday.  For way too many people, if you & everyone in the household eats until they\u2019re totally full the they simply won\u2019t be able to eat every day.  Rationing is real.  And that\u2019s due to systemic issues.  OP should have made plates for everyone INCLUDING herself before anyone started eating.  But the  reality of 2023 is that many people, esp families, have to ration and that there are many times that people will not be fully full/would desire more.  This is not abusive, it\u2019s a sad state of reality.", "She is so likely to get fucked over.", "Agree 100%. Every helpful comment about putting her plate in the oven or fridge ignores the main issue  \n\nShe had not eaten. She made a complex homemade meal from scratch. She took care of everyone else\u2019s dinner and told a man who supposedly loves her that she had not eaten. He ate her serving and all the potential leftovers too. \n\nThe issue is love and respect.", "Sounds like you need a bigger table then.", "For what he did?\n\nShe made dinner from scratch, and he left her nothing to eat. If they didn\u2019t have kids, that would be a throw the whole man out offense.", "I don\u2019t ever remember anyone in my family eating all the food prepared for a meal so that one specific person was left with nothing to eat. This behavior seems pretty egregious to me.", "If they don\u2019t apologise? I agree that I wouldn\u2019t have a petty argument with a partner drag on like this.

This isn\u2019t me judging- mad respect to all SAHM. And I\u2019m not like a pro marriage nutjob.
