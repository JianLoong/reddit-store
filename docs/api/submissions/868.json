Lets say you fail by 1% which the 6% could have easily taken care of. You will then have to pay to redo this subject ect. (no doubt more expensive than the trip) its not worth the risk logically.   \nand you are right, You are not a parent, so they are not your responsibility.  \nThey are putting them selves above all their children and thats not ok at all.", "NTA at all. Think of it this way\u2026 if they were paying an actual babysitter, and the babysitter said they can\u2019t watch the kids one weekend to study, your parents would need to find another. End of story. It would be super weird to push the issue. The fact that they\u2019re trying to guilt you here is ridiculous \u2014 even if they are paying you for the time you do watch them. I\u2019m sure your youngest siblings will come back around. \n\nAlso, your parents need you to watch 7 pre-teen to teenage aged kids? If the third youngest is 14, there are 4 kids between 14 and 21\u2026 older teens can 100% take care of themselves for a while and would be able to watch the others. I don\u2019t really understand that. It wouldn\u2019t even be your problem if they were actual children, but the fact that half of them are probably old enough to drive is super weird here.", "They're both surgeons, yeah, they can get a weekend nanny.

They r being selfish and taking advantage of u. I helped raise 2 siblings with a single mom, no pay. Hell still am as they have both lived with me as adults, one still does.

Your mom got mad because u spoke the truth.", "NTA, but they are never going to budge on this. They already had the kids. I mean, especially if all you had to do was point out the fact that you aren't your siblings parents to be enough to make her cry, then that in it of itself just highlights the one sided entitlement of parents, but again, this is all irrelevant because the relationship between parent and child in the vast majority of parents eyes, is one sided. So no use in arguing, even less use in feeling bad about it because you did nothing wrong.", "You spoke facts. They are their kids, not yours. They didn\u2019t even think to ask if you\u2019re good to watch your siblings before they purchased their trip. It\u2019s not right for them to think their weekend getaway trumps your lab assignments. It may have come off harsh, but nah, NTA.", "NTA. Bottom line is they\u2019re not your kids. If they pay you every weekend (and have trauma surgeon salary) they can certainly afford a weekend nanny while they go out of town.", "NTA, and stop apologizing. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. In this area, They\u2019re deficient as parents.", "NTA.\n\nThey assumed you would watch them...so without asking, they booked a non refundable getaway.\n\nTheir poor planning is not your fault. It's horrible that they are using your siblings to guilt you\nFocus on your education.", "NTA What you experienced is called parentification, it's a very real, surprisingly not that uncommon, issue. I'm the TINIEST bit relieved to hear they pay you for watching them on the weekends, but that does not change the fact they should not be relying on you for childcare. \n\nIt genuinely horrifies me that they think booking a getaway takes priority when you need to study for your labs. Your education is your biggest priority, theirs is supposed to be their children. And even if one argued their priority is also their job, this is all because they want a VACATION? And the way they are manipulating you and guilting you is despicable.\n\nI say this gently, but as someone who went through a similar thing, you may want to consider therapy. I get the distinct impression this situation is worse than you realize, and therapy made a world of difference in helping me feel comfortable creating boundaries and sticking up for yourself. The fact you're here wondering if you're in any way an asshole for refusing to watch your siblings so your parents can enjoy a vacation, genuinely saddens me, and makes me think this is only part of a much deeper issue with your family dynamic.", "Your parents are both trauma surgeons that require many YEARS of school on top of a hospital residency. They prioritized their schooling for their careers. They decided to have all those kids and maintain their careers. Now it\u2019s your turn to focus on your school. You are not their babysitter and like you said\u2014THEY decided to have eight kids\u2014not you. So they can start acting like parents and deal with making their own babysitting arrangements. \n\nBy getting upset with you and not answering your calls or texts\u2014they are manipulating you to feel guilty.

Studying is important, and as surgeons, they should understand better than anyone.", "NTA, your parents are out of line.\n\nYou're 21, so this makes the next-in-age siblings 19, 17?

I know first hand... They have been able to do so thanks to you. They have been in the position to have a career, partly thanks to you. And now they are demanding you put your future and career aside in their intrest? The audacity!!!\n\nYou have been a good son and sibling far too long. It's time to put yourself at number 1. Having contact with your siblings is a part of that, i know. But remember 1 thing: they will come around. All of them. They need you more then you need them.\n\nI can't believe parents use their kids like this and ask for such a sacrifice.", "NTA they are the ones being selfish with their little weekend getaway when you already said that you are too busy. Your parents unequivocally suck for having that many kids when they are in the jobs they are. They barely qualify as parents.", "NTA - you said the truth. If your mother cannot handle it, that\u2019s on her. You are not responsible for your siblings. They are choosing themselves over their children and that is not what parents do. Especially not to their other children. Stop apologizing and stick to your guns.", "INFO \n\nAre you leaving some information out?  I asked because you say the youngest is 11. That means all the other kids are older. An 11 year old barely needs a baby sitter. Let alone older kids. Why can't your siblings just watch themselves and each other? \n\nWhy do they drive their 7 teenage kids to a three bedroom every weekend for an unnecessary babysitter? \n\nWhy aren't the trauma surgeons not just paying for another baby sitter?\n\nAnd just out off curiosity do your parents drive a huge van to drive the kids around or how does that work?", "NTA.  Please don't let them manipulate you into thinking you have any blame. They can afford to hire a nanny for the duration of the trip. Don't miss your lab for this.

They\u2019ve parentified you. Your siblings may be upset with you now because they\u2019ve been conditioned too, but they will come to understand.

OP... They literally asked you to skip your lab.... YOUR EDUCATION... So they can go on a VACATION. They've parentified you, as the oldest child.\n\nIt's one thing for them to ask you to help when they're working (even then they can get a babysitter). Now that they're going on a vacation, they expect you to do something that is a detriment to YOUR GRADES & FUTURE.\n\nDo they pay for your housing or just for when your siblings come over?

They are used to you doing their job. It will be difficult but you must assert and  keep your boundaries. There will be pushback but if you can stay calm and simply say that are available by choice and in advance with rights of refusal. You love your sibs but you are building your own career and life. Since you are willing to help out at times, there must be mutual agreement. You don\u2019t owe them more than a basic explanation. You can be helpful but not on call. You are the adult now.
