Due to his two jobs, the majority of housekeeping and cooking is my responsibility. My husband spends extra time with the kids and taking care of them when he's off or has an hour or two of downtime, and does stuff around the house on his off time. We are happy with this arrangement and it works for us.\n\nMy niece Jenny (20F, fake name) is staying with us while she's in college. The only expenses she has is her own food if she doesn't want to eat what we make, her car and her gas so she works part-time. She does not like our arrangement at all. Jenny is constantly on about how my husband needs to be doing more around the house and taking care of his kids. I've told her that his contribution is working so that I can pursue staying home but she doesn't listen and has told both of us that it needs to be 50/50 with housekeeping and childcare. My husband for the most part ignores her, he told her one time he does what he can, when he can, and hasn't entertained her pestering since. It got to a point I told Jenny she either needs to respect our dynamic, not agree with just respect, or she would need to figure out a different living arrangement.\n\nA couple days ago my husband got home early around 1130pm. He wanted to play some games to unwind before we went to bed. He asked if I moved his console. We were looking for it when Jenny came up from the basement and said that she had his console and would give it back once he actually helped around the house so I could get a break. We got his console back after telling her we will not tolerate stealing in our house and told her we'd figure out what to do about her by morning. We decided to give her one last chance before going to the kick her out option. We asked what all she thought he should be doing around the house and she told us, and we then told her that she would be responsible for all of those tasks minus child care for the week. We sent our oldest to my parents and for the first 4 days, if it was on that list, I didn\u2019t do it. Some mess accumulated, and meals didn\u2019t get made 2 out of those 4 days. Jenny complained that she couldn\u2019t do everything with her studies and job but I told her I didn\u2019t want to hear it since she expected my husband to do it. The 5th day, Jenny left to stay with a friend and I got a call from my sister. She feels what we did was cruel and too far since Jenny \u2018was just trying to stand up for her aunt\u2019. I told her I didn\u2019t need Jenny standing up for me, what I needed was for her to respect how my husband and I run our household and not always have a go at him. She wants us to let Jenny come back and drop the cleaning lesson, but I told her no way since she DID steal from my husband over this. My own parents are now backing my sister.

She now realises how difficult it is for your husband, and that he is actually trying to help.\n2. She had no business trying to tell you how to live your life.\n3. As a rent free occupant of the house, she should have been pitching in with the chores in any case. \n4. What she did was blatantly disrespectful to your husband.\n\nThat you did not kick her out, and decided to use this as a teachable moment reflects well on you. Stay strong OP.", "NTA. She wasn't trying to \"stand up for her aunt\", she was trying to insert her unwelcome ideology into your home because she doesn't agree with you. Then she decided it would be appropriate to take a parental role (over two adults) in your home and \"punish\" your husband for not doing what she thinks he ought to be doing.\n\nYour solution was very clever. Give her a taste of what she's demanding your husband, who is working two jobs, to do.  She couldn't hack it, lol.\n\nShe thought she was being your hero, champion for women's rights! Turns out she's just an AH pushing her unwelcome beliefs onto others.", "NTA.\n\nJenny has some nerve. She contributes nothing to the household, get gets free room and food. Frankly, were I you, I\u2019d hold to her keeping up some of the cleaning as a requirement to move back in. Tell your sister that Jenny\u2019s attempt at a power play woke you up to the fact that it would be good to have more help around the house. But before we start asking those who already contribute to the household to do more, it makes sense to put the work on the person who until now has done nothing.", "NTA, Little shit is getting exactly what she deserves. She says your husband doesn\u2019t do enough even with all his jobs and responsibilities and now she can\u2019t handle it with all her job and responsibilities.

You have a situation that works for you and your husband.  You asked her kindly to butt out.  She didn't and escalated by stealing something in your house to force the point, so you set it up so she could attempt to walk the talk and she couldn't.  FAFO here.\n\n  \nShe should have stopped when you told her to leave it alone but she didn't.  \n\n\nWhen you're young, your idealistic on how things should be but it doesn't always work that way in the real world or in relationships.   That's a lesson she really needs to learn.\n\nShe had a sweet deal at your house and she messed it up.

Your husband is working 2 jobs and does help as much as he can manage. It's reasonable for him to help a little because SAHM is 24/7 while his two jobs aren't. But 50/50 is unreasonable when he works outside the home and you don't. His job has to factor into the division of labor.\n\nHard to say if your niece actually learned anything since she ran away and tattled on you. But hopefully she'll shut up about it now.", "NTA- your niece is very entitled to cross boundaries like that.

The lesson would have been her and her crap on the sidewalk.\n\nEdit for autocorrect", "NTA.\n\nHer staying with you and your husband is a *privilege*. She has no right to project her beliefs on how your household should be run unto you.", "It sounds like the niece reads too much of AITA with this 50/50 ideology.

Instead of just kicking her out you tried to teach her a lesson but it didn\u2019t stick. If the dynamic works for both you and your husband, don\u2019t fix what isn\u2019t broken. It was none of her business to get involved considering this is a temporary situation for her. \n\nI personally wouldn\u2019t allow her back into my house at all just because of the stealing. It\u2019s one thing to make her opinion known it\u2019s another to think she had any right to teach your husband a lesson.

Your rules. Damn audacity of any of these people to dictate terms when you're doing them a favor.", "NAH- I think this is just a case of a young adult thinking they know everything.   \nHaving been married for lots of years, no relationship is 50/50 all the time.  Sometimes my hubby does more, or I do because we just get things done when they need it and that works for us.\n\nI think the part niece is stuck on is, she can't understand WHY you'd want to be at home all the time. So you must be 'stuck' or 'forced' into it, not a choice you and your man made while having kids.  Having her seen what needs to be done, thats fine, now she knows how much work goes into keeping a home/family/job.", "Info: Do you not want Jenny back in your house at all, or do you not want to drop the cleaning lesson?

You didn\u2019t make the point you were trying to make.\n\nShe is being fed a narrative that women are helpless and oppressed by being made to do housework, that housework and child care are not valuable and that you must be suffering from internalized misogyny. She\u2019s 20 so she thinks she knows everything but I would have tried to make her understand that you do what you do out of gratitude not obligation. \n\nI stayed at home too. I am thankful I got to be with my kids all day and give all of my time and energy to them instead of a boss who doesn\u2019t care about me, and instead of leaving my kids with people who only get paid to care about them. I got to clean and decorate my house the way I want, cook and garden and spend time out in the fresh air. What made any of that possible was my husband earning enough for both of us. You are also earning that salary by doing all of the things he doesn\u2019t have the energy to do.", "Info: when she has made these comments before, how were they addressed? Was there actual conversation where you could explain what you said here and she could ask questions or defend her views? Or was she told \u2018this is what works for us\u2019 without any further explanation? \n\nAlso, is it possible she watched her Mom do more than the lion\u2019s share of the home without help by her own father which colored her view of life?", "ESH. I think it\u2019s obvious why Jenny is an asshole; your lifestyle is not subject to her approval, and stealing your husband\u2019s game console until he complied with her demands was absolutely wrong. You\u2019re an asshole too, though. It\u2019s not for trying to make the point, but don\u2019t you think the point is made? She tapped out. She said, \u201cUncle.\u201d (lol). She was wrong, but if this was about rehabilitation, you should be willing to take her back with an apology and a promise to stay in her lane. The fact that you think she should have to finish her sentence tells me this is more about retribution, and that\u2019s not helpful for anybody.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is a microcosm of that phenomenon.\n\nAnd \u201cafter all she\u2019s done?\u201d LOL. She hid a PS5 (or whatever) for a night. It was stupid, it was bratty and she was clearly in the wrong, but she didn\u2019t hurt anyone. It was a very temporary, very superficial inconvenience.

When we first had our daughter, my husband and I both worked and split things equally. After our second was born, I stayed home.  Basically, I\u2019m telling you to this to let you know that I understand your dynamic at home and what you and your husband are each managing respectively. \n\nRegardless of what she thinks she knows about it, she has no say here. Even if I was a guest I your home, having been a SAHM with a working husband and small kids, I shouldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t have an opinion on how you split your responsibilities.

But really what she is doing is putting her nose into somewhere it doesn\u2019t belong for an imaginary cause.  What is even more NOT in her favor is that she\u2019s 20.  She likely has never managed a household, a serious relationship or kids. Let alone all 3 tied together. She has no personal basis for her opinion, except for what she has seen her parents do. \n\nWhat she and your sister need to realize is this is a bigger issue than just her having an opinion.  She is adding extra stress where it doesn\u2019t need to be - for you and your husband.  She is disrespecting both of you. She has been asked to stop multiple times, and she didn\u2019t.  She\u2019s undermining your authority in your home. She\u2019s also basically saying that you\u2019re a doormat. Like you\u2019re unable to stand up for yourself and you need someone to step in and be your hero. She\u2019s making decisions for you and ignoring you when you ask her to stop - because somehow she knows better.  You had every right to allow her to gain some perspective.  You tried other avenues to shut it down, and gave her other options. She forced your hand.  Honestly. This was the best way to go about it.  You gave her the chance to prove you wrong.  For all of the reasons stated above, you could have just requested she move out, no way around it. But you didn\u2019t.", "NTA. I'd drop the lesson from this point on just because I'd feel bad if she missed a school assignment or something, but that would be to do something kind, not correct an injustice.

She assumes that since your husband is working, and that you are the one who is physically contributing to  household upkeep, this must mean that your husband is exploiting you. Of course, that is certainly not the case at all.\n\nYour husband making money ***is*** a form of household upkeep -- without it, you couldn't afford to properly care for your kids, afford your house, or even be so generous as to let your niece live with you rent free.\n\nIf both parties in the relationship are happy with this arrangement, and division of upkeep (whether financial or physical) is about even, I see absolutely no reason for anything to change.

Not what other women think we should do. But that we should have the option to pursue the life we want whatever it is.  This is your life and your way.

Your family sucks.", "I would never let this child (calling her a child because she is acting like one) back into my home. \n\nNTA not even a little. You were just getting her to do the job she thought your hubby should do even though he is working two jobs. I thought that was a fabulous life lesson.  She didn't follow through. \n\nHas the child even apologized? I'm guessing not. Which is the main reason I would never ever let her back into my home. Her lack of respect (and common sense) towards how you have arranged your life is mind boggling.", "I would have sent that brat packing long before.

The house and family is a full time job and he works full time to make sure I can do mine and have everything necessary to make it as smooth as it can be with a toddler. Niece needs to understand that you can\u2019t force people into your viewpoint and that committing crimes to attempt that is right out. These young folks today need some reality checks.", "NTA... I think this is a brilliant lesson. And also perhaps this is the first time Jenny has seen what a real PARTNERSHIP looks like, with communication and commitment.

My husband works his ass off to make this happen. I make sure he always has a hot meal at home, lunch and breakfast packed, complete support from me, and time to himself to unwind.

She owes you and your husband an apology.", "NTA.  It was an important lesson for her to learn.  She expressed her opinion, you heard her and explained that this arrangement is great for you and your husband.  At that point she needed to drop the subject and mind her own business.
