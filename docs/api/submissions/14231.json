Due to his two jobs, the majority of housekeeping and cooking is my responsibility. My husband spends extra time with the kids and taking care of them when he's off or has an hour or two of downtime, and does stuff around the house on his off time. We are happy with this arrangement and it works for us.\n\nMy niece Jenny (20F, fake name) is staying with us while she's in college. The only expenses she has is her own food if she doesn't want to eat what we make, her car and her gas so she works part-time. She does not like our arrangement at all. Jenny is constantly on about how my husband needs to be doing more around the house and taking care of his kids. I've told her that his contribution is working so that I can pursue staying home but she doesn't listen and has told both of us that it needs to be 50/50 with housekeeping and childcare. My husband for the most part ignores her, he told her one time he does what he can, when he can, and hasn't entertained her pestering since. It got to a point I told Jenny she either needs to respect our dynamic, not agree with just respect, or she would need to figure out a different living arrangement.\n\nA couple days ago my husband got home early around 1130pm. He wanted to play some games to unwind before we went to bed. He asked if I moved his console. We were looking for it when Jenny came up from the basement and said that she had his console and would give it back once he actually helped around the house so I could get a break. We got his console back after telling her we will not tolerate stealing in our house and told her we'd figure out what to do about her by morning. We decided to give her one last chance before going to the kick her out option. We asked what all she thought he should be doing around the house and she told us, and we then told her that she would be responsible for all of those tasks minus child care for the week. We sent our oldest to my parents and for the first 4 days, if it was on that list, I didn\u2019t do it. Some mess accumulated, and meals didn\u2019t get made 2 out of those 4 days. Jenny complained that she couldn\u2019t do everything with her studies and job but I told her I didn\u2019t want to hear it since she expected my husband to do it. The 5th day, Jenny left to stay with a friend and I got a call from my sister. She feels what we did was cruel and too far since Jenny \u2018was just trying to stand up for her aunt\u2019. I told her I didn\u2019t need Jenny standing up for me, what I needed was for her to respect how my husband and I run our household and not always have a go at him. She wants us to let Jenny come back and drop the cleaning lesson, but I told her no way since she DID steal from my husband over this. My own parents are now backing my sister.

She seems to have confused the concepts of \u201cequal division of labor\u201d and \u201cequitable division of labor.\u201d\n\nThe division need not be 50/50 to be equitable. \n\nYour husband works, so the equitable division of household labor is NOT equal if he takes on a disproportionate amount of labor when factoring in his out-of-home labor. \n\nEquitable is not the same as equal. \n\nFurthermore, even though she thinks that she is helping you by complaining about your household and marital arrangement, what she is actually doing is the opposite - she\u2019s treating you like you don\u2019t have the agency and autonomy to make informed decisions as an adult woman.  \n\nHer idea of feminism is very, very skewed.\n\n**edited for clarity**", "NTA.\n\n1. She now realises how difficult it is for your husband, and that he is actually trying to help.\n2. She had no business trying to tell you how to live your life.\n3. As a rent free occupant of the house, she should have been pitching in with the chores in any case. \n4. What she did was blatantly disrespectful to your husband.\n\nThat you did not kick her out, and decided to use this as a teachable moment reflects well on you. Stay strong OP.", "NTA. She wasn't trying to \"stand up for her aunt\", she was trying to insert her unwelcome ideology into your home because she doesn't agree with you. Then she decided it would be appropriate to take a parental role (over two adults) in your home and \"punish\" your husband for not doing what she thinks he ought to be doing.\n\nYour solution was very clever. Give her a taste of what she's demanding your husband, who is working two jobs, to do.  She couldn't hack it, lol.\n\nShe thought she was being your hero, champion for women's rights! Turns out she's just an AH pushing her unwelcome beliefs onto others.", "NTA.\n\nJenny has some nerve. She contributes nothing to the household, get gets free room and food. Frankly, were I you, I\u2019d hold to her keeping up some of the cleaning as a requirement to move back in. Tell your sister that Jenny\u2019s attempt at a power play woke you up to the fact that it would be good to have more help around the house. But before we start asking those who already contribute to the household to do more, it makes sense to put the work on the person who until now has done nothing.", "NTA, Little shit is getting exactly what she deserves. She says your husband doesn\u2019t do enough even with all his jobs and responsibilities and now she can\u2019t handle it with all her job and responsibilities.

I would stick to your guns and not let her back til she apologises.", "NTA\n\nThe fucking *audacity* of someone living rent-free treating their AUNT like a child. Your niece has a lot of growing up to do, and they're gonna find out.

You have a situation that works for you and your husband.  You asked her kindly to butt out.  She didn't and escalated by stealing something in your house to force the point, so you set it up so she could attempt to walk the talk and she couldn't.  FAFO here.\n\n  \nShe should have stopped when you told her to leave it alone but she didn't.  \n\n\nWhen you're young, your idealistic on how things should be but it doesn't always work that way in the real world or in relationships.   That's a lesson she really needs to learn.\n\nShe had a sweet deal at your house and she messed it up.

Your husband is working 2 jobs and does help as much as he can manage. It's reasonable for him to help a little because SAHM is 24/7 while his two jobs aren't. But 50/50 is unreasonable when he works outside the home and you don't. His job has to factor into the division of labor.\n\nHard to say if your niece actually learned anything since she ran away and tattled on you. But hopefully she'll shut up about it now.", "NTA- your niece is very entitled to cross boundaries like that.

This works for you and your husband and if it were to stop working, I hope you would change.", "NTA.

The lesson would have been her and her crap on the sidewalk.\n\nEdit for autocorrect", "NTA.\n\nHer staying with you and your husband is a *privilege*. She has no right to project her beliefs on how your household should be run unto you.", "It sounds like the niece reads too much of AITA with this 50/50 ideology.

You're better than I, as family or not don't ever come in thinking you run a thing feelings will be hurt. Indeed", "NTA Your house your rules. The arrangement you and your husband created for yourselves is working quite nicely to you and your husband's happiness.

Instead of just kicking her out you tried to teach her a lesson but it didn\u2019t stick. If the dynamic works for both you and your husband, don\u2019t fix what isn\u2019t broken. It was none of her business to get involved considering this is a temporary situation for her. \n\nI personally wouldn\u2019t allow her back into my house at all just because of the stealing. It\u2019s one thing to make her opinion known it\u2019s another to think she had any right to teach your husband a lesson. If she can\u2019t accept your families way of living than she has no reason to be in the same household.", "You picked an awesome punishment,  OP. Perfect for the situation.

Your rules. Damn audacity of any of these people to dictate terms when you're doing them a favor.", "NAH- I think this is just a case of a young adult thinking they know everything.   \nHaving been married for lots of years, no relationship is 50/50 all the time.  Sometimes my hubby does more, or I do because we just get things done when they need it and that works for us.\n\nI think the part niece is stuck on is, she can't understand WHY you'd want to be at home all the time. So you must be 'stuck' or 'forced' into it, not a choice you and your man made while having kids.  Having her seen what needs to be done, thats fine, now she knows how much work goes into keeping a home/family/job.", "Info: Do you not want Jenny back in your house at all, or do you not want to drop the cleaning lesson?

You didn\u2019t make the point you were trying to make.\n\nShe is being fed a narrative that women are helpless and oppressed by being made to do housework, that housework and child care are not valuable and that you must be suffering from internalized misogyny. She\u2019s 20 so she thinks she knows everything but I would have tried to make her understand that you do what you do out of gratitude not obligation. \n\nI stayed at home too. I am thankful I got to be with my kids all day and give all of my time and energy to them instead of a boss who doesn\u2019t care about me, and instead of leaving my kids with people who only get paid to care about them. I got to clean and decorate my house the way I want, cook and garden and spend time out in the fresh air. What made any of that possible was my husband earning enough for both of us. You are also earning that salary by doing all of the things he doesn\u2019t have the energy to do.", "Info: when she has made these comments before, how were they addressed? Was there actual conversation where you could explain what you said here and she could ask questions or defend her views? Or was she told \u2018this is what works for us\u2019 without any further explanation? \n\nAlso, is it possible she watched her Mom do more than the lion\u2019s share of the home without help by her own father which colored her view of life?", "ESH. I think it\u2019s obvious why Jenny is an asshole; your lifestyle is not subject to her approval, and stealing your husband\u2019s game console until he complied with her demands was absolutely wrong. You\u2019re an asshole too, though. It\u2019s not for trying to make the point, but don\u2019t you think the point is made? She tapped out. She said, \u201cUncle.\u201d (lol). She was wrong, but if this was about rehabilitation, you should be willing to take her back with an apology and a promise to stay in her lane. The fact that you think she should have to finish her sentence tells me this is more about retribution, and that\u2019s not helpful for anybody.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If your husband is expected to help you around the house then so should she. She had basically a free-ride staying with you and you doing everything. Did she step up and offer to help you?

If OP were to simply request an apology from Jenny to them, and a promise to be more respectful and understanding in future, then a good lesson would be learned. Belabouring the point would just breed resentment and keep the wound festering for everyone. And whatever for?

Your reasoning makes sense. It's still NTA for me as long as the cleaning lesson is well, exactly that, a lesson, and not you making her take care of the chores you don't want to burden your husband with. (In which case you would still be within your right but this sub is 'Am I the asshole?' not 'Do I have the right to do this?')\nShe is clearly a very spoiled brat and she's lucky she didn't get in worse trouble over this.", "If the point is to correct the bad behavior, then the term shouldn\u2019t matter. Making her finish the week makes this about extracting a pound of flesh. I\u2019m not surprised I\u2019m getting downvoted. The world is obsessed with defending our broken model of punitive justice despite decades of evidence that it doesn\u2019t work and creates new problems. This is a microcosm of that phenomenon.\n\nAnd \u201cafter all she\u2019s done?\u201d LOL. She hid a PS5 (or whatever) for a night. It was stupid, it was bratty and she was clearly in the wrong, but she didn\u2019t hurt anyone. It was a very temporary, very superficial inconvenience. Again, either the point is correcting bad behavior or the point is making her pay for her transgressions. The former is constructive, the latter is juvenile and counterproductive."]}
