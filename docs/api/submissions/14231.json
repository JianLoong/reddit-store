Due to his two jobs, the majority of housekeeping and cooking is my responsibility. My husband spends extra time with the kids and taking care of them when he's off or has an hour or two of downtime, and does stuff around the house on his off time. We are happy with this arrangement and it works for us.\n\nMy niece Jenny (20F, fake name) is staying with us while she's in college. The only expenses she has is her own food if she doesn't want to eat what we make, her car and her gas so she works part-time. She does not like our arrangement at all. Jenny is constantly on about how my husband needs to be doing more around the house and taking care of his kids. I've told her that his contribution is working so that I can pursue staying home but she doesn't listen and has told both of us that it needs to be 50/50 with housekeeping and childcare. My husband for the most part ignores her, he told her one time he does what he can, when he can, and hasn't entertained her pestering since. It got to a point I told Jenny she either needs to respect our dynamic, not agree with just respect, or she would need to figure out a different living arrangement.\n\nA couple days ago my husband got home early around 1130pm. He wanted to play some games to unwind before we went to bed. He asked if I moved his console. We were looking for it when Jenny came up from the basement and said that she had his console and would give it back once he actually helped around the house so I could get a break. We got his console back after telling her we will not tolerate stealing in our house and told her we'd figure out what to do about her by morning. We decided to give her one last chance before going to the kick her out option. We asked what all she thought he should be doing around the house and she told us, and we then told her that she would be responsible for all of those tasks minus child care for the week. We sent our oldest to my parents and for the first 4 days, if it was on that list, I didn\u2019t do it. Some mess accumulated, and meals didn\u2019t get made 2 out of those 4 days. Jenny complained that she couldn\u2019t do everything with her studies and job but I told her I didn\u2019t want to hear it since she expected my husband to do it. The 5th day, Jenny left to stay with a friend and I got a call from my sister. She feels what we did was cruel and too far since Jenny \u2018was just trying to stand up for her aunt\u2019. I told her I didn\u2019t need Jenny standing up for me, what I needed was for her to respect how my husband and I run our household and not always have a go at him. She wants us to let Jenny come back and drop the cleaning lesson, but I told her no way since she DID steal from my husband over this. My own parents are now backing my sister. Were we wrong to have Jenny do housework to make a point?\n\nEdit: To the concerned people that keep suggesting crisis helplines to me: please go touch grass.

She now realises how difficult it is for your husband, and that he is actually trying to help.\n2. She had no business trying to tell you how to live your life.\n3. As a rent free occupant of the house, she should have been pitching in with the chores in any case. \n4. What she did was blatantly disrespectful to your husband.\n\nThat you did not kick her out, and decided to use this as a teachable moment reflects well on you. Stay strong OP.", "NTA. She wasn't trying to \"stand up for her aunt\", she was trying to insert her unwelcome ideology into your home because she doesn't agree with you. Then she decided it would be appropriate to take a parental role (over two adults) in your home and \"punish\" your husband for not doing what she thinks he ought to be doing.\n\nYour solution was very clever. Give her a taste of what she's demanding your husband, who is working two jobs, to do.  She couldn't hack it, lol.\n\nShe thought she was being your hero, champion for women's rights! Turns out she's just an AH pushing her unwelcome beliefs onto others.", "NTA.\n\nJenny has some nerve. She contributes nothing to the household, get gets free room and food.

Tell your sister that Jenny\u2019s attempt at a power play woke you up to the fact that it would be good to have more help around the house. But before we start asking those who already contribute to the household to do more, it makes sense to put the work on the person who until now has done nothing.", "NTA, Little shit is getting exactly what she deserves. She says your husband doesn\u2019t do enough even with all his jobs and responsibilities and now she can\u2019t handle it with all her job and responsibilities.

You have a situation that works for you and your husband.  You asked her kindly to butt out.  She didn't and escalated by stealing something in your house to force the point, so you set it up so she could attempt to walk the talk and she couldn't.

Your husband is working 2 jobs and does help as much as he can manage. It's reasonable for him to help a little because SAHM is 24/7 while his two jobs aren't.

His job has to factor into the division of labor.\n\nHard to say if your niece actually learned anything since she ran away and tattled on you.

Instead of just kicking her out you tried to teach her a lesson but it didn\u2019t stick. If the dynamic works for both you and your husband, don\u2019t fix what isn\u2019t broken. It was none of her business to get involved considering this is a temporary situation for her. \n\nI personally wouldn\u2019t allow her back into my house at all just because of the stealing. It\u2019s one thing to make her opinion known it\u2019s another to think she had any right to teach your husband a lesson.

Sometimes my hubby does more, or I do because we just get things done when they need it and that works for us.\n\nI think the part niece is stuck on is, she can't understand WHY you'd want to be at home all the time.

You didn\u2019t make the point you were trying to make.\n\nShe is being fed a narrative that women are helpless and oppressed by being made to do housework, that housework and child care are not valuable and that you must be suffering from internalized misogyny. She\u2019s 20 so she thinks she knows everything but I would have tried to make her understand that you do what you do out of gratitude not obligation. \n\nI stayed at home too. I am thankful I got to be with my kids all day and give all of my time and energy to them instead of a boss who doesn\u2019t care about me, and instead of leaving my kids with people who only get paid to care about them. I got to clean and decorate my house the way I want, cook and garden and spend time out in the fresh air. What made any of that possible was my husband earning enough for both of us. You are also earning that salary by doing all of the things he doesn\u2019t have the energy to do.", "Info: when she has made these comments before, how were they addressed? Was there actual conversation where you could explain what you said here and she could ask questions or defend her views? Or was she told \u2018this is what works for us\u2019 without any further explanation? \n\nAlso, is it possible she watched her Mom do more than the lion\u2019s share of the home without help by her own father which colored her view of life?", "ESH. I think it\u2019s obvious why Jenny is an asshole; your lifestyle is not subject to her approval, and stealing your husband\u2019s game console until he complied with her demands was absolutely wrong. You\u2019re an asshole too, though. It\u2019s not for trying to make the point, but don\u2019t you think the point is made? She tapped out. She said, \u201cUncle.\u201d (lol). She was wrong, but if this was about rehabilitation, you should be willing to take her back with an apology and a promise to stay in her lane.

I would never have had the audacity to talk to anyone who I was living with rent free like that. I didn\u2019t even talk to my parents like that when I paid rent to live with them as an adult. And I was NOT NICE to my parents for most of my life.\n\nNTA, OP. She needs to learn that lesson and it\u2019s a shame she\u2019s chosen to actively avoid learning it.", "The niece also missed the irony that it was OP\u2019s husband working so much that was allowing her free room and board so that she didn\u2019t have to work more at her job to pay for it on her own.", "That just further prevents her from one day becoming an adult.", "In some small amount of fairness, I\u2019ve only ever really heard of adult diapers being referred to as Depends before in my life. Kind of like BandAid vs adhesive bandage or Kleenex vs tissue.", "Right after I was born, my dad worked 2 jobs and my mom worked 1 job 6 days a week in elementary school they both worked 2 jobs(1 FT, 1 PT each). As an adult I have dinner at their house at least once a week and usually they have dinner at ours once a week as well. Kids are capable of understanding that parents make sacrifices for what they think is best. I'm sorry your situation was different but do you really think these kids are going to resent the time they were able to source with their mother?", "I spent about a decade of my adult life as a very happy SAHM. And I have also been a single mom, an active-duty mom, and now I am the breadwinner mom and I am very happy here, too.", "Making her finish the days would help her become an adult. If they just let her come back consequence free, she will likely continue her terrible behavior and learn nothing.", "I\u2019m the early 80s there was a debate ar MIT. Phyllis Shaffly herself took part.  The only thing I remember of the whole thing was her saying \u201ca woman trades her virginity to her husband for support and protection\u201d. My roommate and I looked at each other, both saying \u201cisn\u2019t that prostitution?\u201d \n\nIn the 90s I stayed home by choice, and got a little grief, but not that much.  I wrote on forms (and my kids, too, when asked their mothers profession) \u201cResearch on child development in the home environment\u201d.", ">I think I\u2019ve repeatedly made my point that Jenny doesn\u2019t know as much as she think she does\n\nThat's not an excuse for any of her actions, especially bc you can't claim that she doesn't know when she was explicitly told something. She absolutely knows to stop bringing up the same topic bc OP was clear in letting her know things were fine.\nShe's a grown adult who needs to take accountability for her behavior. Claiming ignorance can only get you so far. \n\n>Yeah, OP should escalate by talking to her sister and let sister handle things with her daughter.\n\nWhat do you think Jenny's mom is going to do to handle her 20 year old daughter? Ground her? Why do you think Jenny's mom speaking to her is going to affect Jenny more than her aunt speaking to her? If Jenny genuinely can't handle listening to anyone other than her mom and reflecting on her own behavior, then she's not ready for the real world and is right to go back home.", "I am a SAHM because I would be unable to make enough money to cover childcare. Its far more common than people think.", "Potentially spiders comment stated that OP *should* be able to choose the arrangement she and her husband have, but also said that there should be systems and support available to make that choice easier and not based on gender as it commonly is (which may or may not be relevant in OP's case since she seems happy with her arrangement). Their comment also means that if OP's situation were reversed that she could work and make the same choice to let her husband stay home and the family wouldn't be in any different kind of situation. Or OP and husband could both work if they wanted to. And yes, the Patriarchy does make all of those options difficult for everyone involved in many different ways. They did not state exactly what systems and supports they recommend, but their comment was certainly open enough to account for varying choices, so I'm not sure why you think it was infantilising when gendered expectations, norms, and socializing do have huge impacts on all of us throughout our lives.", "Can you point out where the comment your replying to makes this claim?", "If she\u2019s adult, she should be able to deal with genuine reactions to her awful behavior. Children get the sort of treatment you\u2019re suggesting.", "I'm a SAHM and if someone asks me if I work I just say yes. I *do* work. I work taking care of these 3 maniac children. You know what I worked as in my twenties? A nanny!", "That\u2019s wild. My mom is very much a first-wave feminist, and mostly worked after having kids. But whenever she was getting to know someone that was a mom, she always asked, \u201cdo you work outside the home?\u201d Because she knew staying home and taking care of the kids & the house was still work.", "Your wife works for a living, she just doesn\u2019t work outside the house. There is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG with not working outside the house but to not even give credit where credit is due is insulting.", ">choices in a patriarchal system are not necessarily choices"]}
