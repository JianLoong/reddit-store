I am aware of ADHD and the nuances and symptoms since my daughter has it as well. But, at least from my point of view, he does nothing to cope or combat it in any way. As a result, I have witnessed him acting extremely negligent to his duties as an adult partner. I don\u2019t mean emotionally or anything, because they can be very sweet together, I mean he\u2019s 100% the type of guy who has to be asked 5x to take the trash out and still doesn\u2019t do it. Every house chore falls onto my daughter, even right after she gave birth, he didn\u2019t do a single load of laundry, a single dish, walk the dog or change a diaper. \n\nHe works full time to support them while my daughter takes care of the baby,  which is nice, but outside of that, he does nothing to contribute to their life from what I\u2019ve seen. He is oblivious to the fact that she\u2019s speaking to him half of the time and she ends up just sitting there talking to herself while he stares at his phone or spaces out.  All of which, he attributes to his ADHD claiming he has \u201cexecutive dysfunction\u201d, or that he gets sidetracked, overwhelmed by multiple chores and starts to get frustrated. She has to call his name over and over again, repeatedly say \u201chello? I\u2019m speaking to you?\u201d For him to even glance up from his phone when she\u2019s sitting 2 feet away from him. \n\nHe\u2019s so not in tune with his surroundings that if the baby cries and she asks him to pitch in and help, he expects to be told what\u2019s wrong with the baby, how to help, where to find everything, because he wasn\u2019t paying any attention. So if she needs him to help with the baby, she\u2019s still not getting whatever else she needs to get done finished, because she\u2019s standing there and walking him through step by step, repeating herself, and still doing 100% of the mental load. \nShe seems so frustrated and upset.\n\nI watched this happen on countless visits and I just had enough of it this time. I watched for a week while my daughter did everything, cooked every meal, cleaned everything, did every feeding, changed every diaper. She did it or I did it, and not once, did her husband even offer to help or notice. When we did things all together he was constantly talking over my daughter, zoning out, or completely not even paying attention, and she has to repeat herself over and over again. Finally I snapped, cleared my throat and asked \u201cwhy are you ignoring your wife when she\u2019s talking to you?\u201d. He started scrambling and trying to explain that it\u2019s just that he has ADHD and can\u2019t help it, and I told him that having ADHD doesn\u2019t give him an excuse to treat my daughter like she\u2019s invisible, and if that\u2019s the extent to which it affects him he needs to see a doctor and get medication. His face got really red and he looked like he was about to cry, and I have to admit that I do feel bad for that, but at the same time, I think he needed to know. My daughter is saying she agrees but says that I owe him an apology for my tone or I won\u2019t be invited back to visit.

For the most part, he\u2019s simply ignoring your daughter and grandchild, and not pulling his weight. \n\nIf possible, stay in your daughter\u2019s life as much as you can.

A better approach would be to focus on supporting her so she can figure out how to navigate her problematic marriage situation. \n\nIf the husband is abusive \u2014 which seems likely, as multiple other commenters have pointed out \u2014 your approach played straight into his hands. Now he can say you \u201cattacked\u201d him and force your daughter to take sides between you and him. That cuts her off from your support and diverts attention from the real issue of his behavior. \n\nA better approach would have been to talk to your daughter about what\u2019s going on. Note some of the issues you\u2019ve seen, ask her what she thinks/feels about what\u2019s happening, and really listen to her responses. Be a safe space and sanity check while she figures out what she wants to do. Make sure she knows she has your support in whatever form SHE wants that support to take. Maybe she actually does want you to directly raise the issue with her husband\u2026 but you should have talked to her about it first.", "NTA, and I say that as an unmedicated, but tested ADHD adult.

He needs to be directed not b*t he\u2019d at.  He needs a list of chores written down and routinely checked off.  Asking him, yelling at him or repeating yourself 10 times isn\u2019t helping.

A big struggle with adhd on its own is it can make you pretty incapable of building habits.  Something that would eventually become almost an instinctual thing for anyone else if you repeat that task 90 times, for an adhd brain it still takes making active decision with the same amount of thought and effort th 90th time as it took the first.  So your idea of adding \"socks\" onto something he already does daily might be easier!\n\nGamification helps me a lot too, since adhd loves novelty. The Tody app works well for me, as a chore tracker that gives you points for finishing tasks. But it's a boring grownup app. Personally, I don't need rewards anymore, the fake points are enough motivation. But there's tons of apps that do similar for kids, like habitca which allows your family to go on an adventure quest and earn rewards the parents set up. Like if you earn 50 points you can redeem them for an ice cream, or 100 points for an extra movie night, etc. Now instead of having to remember 11 separate daily tasks (put away trash, move laundry, brush teeth, etc) you just remember one \"have you checked your chore game today?\"  There's tons of versions of these apps too.

Remember, cleaning is morally neutral. It doesn't mean you're a bad person if you have to do things differently.

It has my vitamins in it,  plus some mini planner stickers that represent my daily chores, sometimes it has a cabby in it too. Dragon on a treadmill sticker means I have to exercise. Vacuum sticker means vacuum. It gets it done. \n\nMaybe you'll prefer the chore charm bracelet method.  Or the heroes journey sidequest decks.
