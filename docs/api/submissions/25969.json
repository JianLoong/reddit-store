As a result, I have witnessed him acting extremely negligent to his duties as an adult partner. I don\u2019t mean emotionally or anything, because they can be very sweet together, I mean he\u2019s 100% the type of guy who has to be asked 5x to take the trash out and still doesn\u2019t do it. Every house chore falls onto my daughter, even right after she gave birth, he didn\u2019t do a single load of laundry, a single dish, walk the dog or change a diaper. \n\nHe works full time to support them while my daughter takes care of the baby,  which is nice, but outside of that, he does nothing to contribute to their life from what I\u2019ve seen. He is oblivious to the fact that she\u2019s speaking to him half of the time and she ends up just sitting there talking to herself while he stares at his phone or spaces out.  All of which, he attributes to his ADHD claiming he has \u201cexecutive dysfunction\u201d, or that he gets sidetracked, overwhelmed by multiple chores and starts to get frustrated. She has to call his name over and over again, repeatedly say \u201chello? I\u2019m speaking to you?\u201d For him to even glance up from his phone when she\u2019s sitting 2 feet away from him. \n\nHe\u2019s so not in tune with his surroundings that if the baby cries and she asks him to pitch in and help, he expects to be told what\u2019s wrong with the baby, how to help, where to find everything, because he wasn\u2019t paying any attention. So if she needs him to help with the baby, she\u2019s still not getting whatever else she needs to get done finished, because she\u2019s standing there and walking him through step by step, repeating herself, and still doing 100% of the mental load. \nShe seems so frustrated and upset.\n\nI watched this happen on countless visits and I just had enough of it this time. I watched for a week while my daughter did everything, cooked every meal, cleaned everything, did every feeding, changed every diaper. She did it or I did it, and not once, did her husband even offer to help or notice. When we did things all together he was constantly talking over my daughter, zoning out, or completely not even paying attention, and she has to repeat herself over and over again. Finally I snapped, cleared my throat and asked \u201cwhy are you ignoring your wife when she\u2019s talking to you?\u201d. He started scrambling and trying to explain that it\u2019s just that he has ADHD and can\u2019t help it, and I told him that having ADHD doesn\u2019t give him an excuse to treat my daughter like she\u2019s invisible, and if that\u2019s the extent to which it affects him he needs to see a doctor and get medication. His face got really red and he looked like he was about to cry, and I have to admit that I do feel bad for that, but at the same time, I think he needed to know.

People with ADHD have limited amounts of mental energy, and depending on what his job is, it's possible that he's basically a zombie by the time he gets home.\n\nHowever, while I concede that it might not be malicious, the fact remains that he has a wife and child at home and he needs to be there for them, and that may require medication as well as learning coping strategies so that he has a bit more energy throughout the day, so my original judgment of NTA still stands.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI have ADHD. It's bad, it's fucked up my entire life. \n\nThis is not just \"ADHD\", it's weaponized incompetence. NTA.\n\nETA the main thing ADHD makes difficult is multi-step tasks, planning, not procrastinating, things like that. If there's an imminent issue in front of my face (like a crying baby) I am able to address that issue, even on my worst days. Don't fall for his crocodile tears.\n\nEdit 2: To me, this has dynamics of an abusive relationship, in which case however you feel about him, you might need to suppress it for the sake of being able to be there to support your daughter and to make sure he's not able to alienate you from your daughter. You don't have to agree with what he does, but you also might want to avoid antagonizing him as well. That way, if and when she is ready to leave him, she knows she has your support.", "NTA. Only some of the things you described in regards to SIL can be contributed to ADHD. The other things are just   \nhim not giving a shit about your daughter and using ADHD as an excuse. Don't expect him to get medication for it because then he wouldn't have the excuse he wants for his behavior. Edited typos.", "As someone with ADHD and a son with wildly unchecked ADHD, I can assure you he is weaponzing his ADHD. For those saying she is TA, THIS IS A FORM OF ABUSE. So if you would stand around and watch your adult kiddo get abused, props to you but most of us wouldn\u2019t. If someone hit your daughter, you would have them arrested (correct response) or take them down (emotional knee jerk reaction with negative consequences). So why is it okay to watch severe emotional abuse and be like \u201cohhhhh I\u2019ll let that slide\u2026.I\u2019ll wait til she has herself a whole breakdown.\u201d  \n\nYou are NTA but you emotionally responded\u2026.which will likely have negative consequences.

A lot of what you describe could be attributed to ADHD but also to weaponized incompetence. It could be a combination of both but mainly to WI and he\u2019s blaming the ADHD. Your daughter is probably to used to his shit and too tired to argue anymore. \n\nI also have ADHD and can relate to many things you describe, such as spacing out, forgetting things or getting sidetracked. But I also take measures. I\u2019m medicated. I write stuff on post its, make lists and keep them in visible places, even write important things in my hands so I won\u2019t forget them.

Absolutely your SIL needs to see a doctor, but it's not clear if he already has. Is his ADHD self-diagnosed? If so, he may not have ADHD but believe he does because he ticks some boxes. He may have something else. The spacing out could be absence seizures, for example. He definitely needs that doctor's appointment to either get a proper diagnosis and/or to discuss treatment options because your daughter can't go on the way things are.\n\nOf course, if he's just a lazy ah the the doctor has no treatment for that, but whatever the issue is, the only apology owed is from him to your daughter.

Something needed to be said here due to the impact on their household. Obviously, we only know very little about the situation, but I think the people jumping straight into your son-in-law being abusive or using weaponized incompetence are jumping the gun (which is extremely common on Reddit). Now, he very well may be doing those things, but we just can't know.\n\nNo two people with ADHD are exactly the same, as you well know with your medical background. Things that your daughter has coping strategies for may be extremely difficult for your SIL. For some people with ADHD, it actually is that severe. I have ADHD and so does my daughter. My daughter's is more severe than mine. When you described what your SIL does, I could see myself or my daughter in some of that at times. We're both on medication (which is a struggle to find at times lately) and there is definitely a difference when we are medicated vs not.\n\nI think the area where you erred, OP, is how intensely & accusatory you came in. When you come in hard like that, a lot of the time we will just shut down on you. We're usually aware & we already feel terrible about it. It sounds like SIL is pretty averse to taking medication at the moment. Perhaps, you could dig into the old medical bag of tricks to try something different. We can indeed get overwhelmed by complex tasks or the sheer volume of tasks. If he needs a task broken into smaller, more manageable tasks, then do that. And if you need him to do something, then ask him. Don't assume he will know how to needs to get done. Yelling at him if he forgets to do something will just cause him to withdraw further.\n\nI think this can be easily fixed. If you apologize for your previous tone, that will definitely help. And then they need to listen to what you have to say. Try to come up with some solutions. If you start off with that and try to work with him, then he might be more receptive.
