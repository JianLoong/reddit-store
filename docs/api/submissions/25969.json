As a result, I have witnessed him acting extremely negligent to his duties as an adult partner. I don\u2019t mean emotionally or anything, because they can be very sweet together, I mean he\u2019s 100% the type of guy who has to be asked 5x to take the trash out and still doesn\u2019t do it. Every house chore falls onto my daughter, even right after she gave birth, he didn\u2019t do a single load of laundry, a single dish, walk the dog or change a diaper. \n\nHe works full time to support them while my daughter takes care of the baby,  which is nice, but outside of that, he does nothing to contribute to their life from what I\u2019ve seen. He is oblivious to the fact that she\u2019s speaking to him half of the time and she ends up just sitting there talking to herself while he stares at his phone or spaces out.  All of which, he attributes to his ADHD claiming he has \u201cexecutive dysfunction\u201d, or that he gets sidetracked, overwhelmed by multiple chores and starts to get frustrated. She has to call his name over and over again, repeatedly say \u201chello? I\u2019m speaking to you?\u201d For him to even glance up from his phone when she\u2019s sitting 2 feet away from him. \n\nHe\u2019s so not in tune with his surroundings that if the baby cries and she asks him to pitch in and help, he expects to be told what\u2019s wrong with the baby, how to help, where to find everything, because he wasn\u2019t paying any attention. So if she needs him to help with the baby, she\u2019s still not getting whatever else she needs to get done finished, because she\u2019s standing there and walking him through step by step, repeating herself, and still doing 100% of the mental load. \nShe seems so frustrated and upset.\n\nI watched this happen on countless visits and I just had enough of it this time. I watched for a week while my daughter did everything, cooked every meal, cleaned everything, did every feeding, changed every diaper. She did it or I did it, and not once, did her husband even offer to help or notice. When we did things all together he was constantly talking over my daughter, zoning out, or completely not even paying attention, and she has to repeat herself over and over again. Finally I snapped, cleared my throat and asked \u201cwhy are you ignoring your wife when she\u2019s talking to you?\u201d. He started scrambling and trying to explain that it\u2019s just that he has ADHD and can\u2019t help it, and I told him that having ADHD doesn\u2019t give him an excuse to treat my daughter like she\u2019s invisible, and if that\u2019s the extent to which it affects him he needs to see a doctor and get medication. His face got really red and he looked like he was about to cry, and I have to admit that I do feel bad for that, but at the same time, I think he needed to know.

People with ADHD have limited amounts of mental energy, and depending on what his job is, it's possible that he's basically a zombie by the time he gets home.\n\nHowever, while I concede that it might not be malicious, the fact remains that he has a wife and child at home and he needs to be there for them, and that may require medication as well as learning coping strategies so that he has a bit more energy throughout the day, so my original judgment of NTA still stands.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI have ADHD. It's bad, it's fucked up my entire life. \n\nThis is not just \"ADHD\", it's weaponized incompetence. NTA.\n\nETA the main thing ADHD makes difficult is multi-step tasks, planning, not procrastinating, things like that. If there's an imminent issue in front of my face (like a crying baby) I am able to address that issue, even on my worst days. Don't fall for his crocodile tears.\n\nEdit 2: To me, this has dynamics of an abusive relationship, in which case however you feel about him, you might need to suppress it for the sake of being able to be there to support your daughter and to make sure he's not able to alienate you from your daughter. You don't have to agree with what he does, but you also might want to avoid antagonizing him as well. That way, if and when she is ready to leave him, she knows she has your support.", "NTA. Only some of the things you described in regards to SIL can be contributed to ADHD. The other things are just   \nhim not giving a shit about your daughter and using ADHD as an excuse. Don't expect him to get medication for it because then he wouldn't have the excuse he wants for his behavior. Edited typos.", "As someone with ADHD and a son with wildly unchecked ADHD, I can assure you he is weaponzing his ADHD. For those saying she is TA, THIS IS A FORM OF ABUSE. So if you would stand around and watch your adult kiddo get abused, props to you but most of us wouldn\u2019t. If someone hit your daughter, you would have them arrested (correct response) or take them down (emotional knee jerk reaction with negative consequences). So why is it okay to watch severe emotional abuse and be like \u201cohhhhh I\u2019ll let that slide\u2026.I\u2019ll wait til she has herself a whole breakdown.\u201d  \n\nYou are NTA but you emotionally responded\u2026.which will likely have negative consequences.

A lot of what you describe could be attributed to ADHD but also to weaponized incompetence. It could be a combination of both but mainly to WI and he\u2019s blaming the ADHD. Your daughter is probably to used to his shit and too tired to argue anymore. \n\nI also have ADHD and can relate to many things you describe, such as spacing out, forgetting things or getting sidetracked. But I also take measures. I\u2019m medicated. I write stuff on post its, make lists and keep them in visible places, even write important things in my hands so I won\u2019t forget them.

He definitely needs that doctor's appointment to either get a proper diagnosis and/or to discuss treatment options because your daughter can't go on the way things are.\n\nOf course, if he's just a lazy ah the the doctor has no treatment for that, but whatever the issue is, the only apology owed is from him to your daughter.

Something needed to be said here due to the impact on their household. Obviously, we only know very little about the situation, but I think the people jumping straight into your son-in-law being abusive or using weaponized incompetence are jumping the gun (which is extremely common on Reddit).

When you come in hard like that, a lot of the time we will just shut down on you. We're usually aware & we already feel terrible about it. It sounds like SIL is pretty averse to taking medication at the moment. Perhaps, you could dig into the old medical bag of tricks to try something different. We can indeed get overwhelmed by complex tasks or the sheer volume of tasks. If he needs a task broken into smaller, more manageable tasks, then do that. And if you need him to do something, then ask him. Don't assume he will know how to needs to get done. Yelling at him if he forgets to do something will just cause him to withdraw further.\n\nI think this can be easily fixed. If you apologize for your previous tone, that will definitely help.

did he have any adaptive mechanisms? were those mechanisms compatible with other people\n\nadaptive mechanisms can include avoidance. maybe that's not doing the laundry until you're out of clothes and have no choice. maybe that's buying cheap underwear and socks in bulk and throwing them away after one use\n\nmaybe that's permanently removing tasks from life like using disposable plates and silverware so you never have to do dishes. or only showering at the gym so you never have to clean the shower, or never shitting at home to avoid cleaning the toilet\n\nmaybe it's physically structuring things to make remembering and doing easy, like having the kitchen garbage can near the front door and eating in the living room near the garbage can\n\nthese kinds of mechanisms often completely collapse when transitioning to living with someone else because of lifestyle clash. the other person has dishes. they want the garbage bin in the kitchen. they're not willing to walk on layers of dirty clothes until you run out of things to wear. and especially if you don't consciously acknowledge the role these things played in your life and your ability to do things, you're unlikely to work with your new environment to make it more compatible to you\n\nafter all the place you live is now no longer under your sole control, you have to agree on things, and it's pretty hard to tell someone \"I can only do laundry if I'm out of clothes and forced to\" and it's especially hard to do that if you don't even recognize that about yourself. and if you just don't do stuff, your partner will get fed up way before you do and will just do it for you. now your partner's lower threshold for living in squalor is your adaptive mechanism and even when you can do stuff, if you hold out long enough they'll just do it for you\n\nnone of this is any kind of excuse though, I'm just explaining the mechanics\n\nit's especially not an excuse given that the kinds of accessibility info you used to only get from specialists is now everywhere. the amount you can actually learn from tiktoks and memes and infographics is genuinely astounding. you can get so many coping skills broken down and explained and modelled, see a million environment adaptation options, learn so many tools for emotional regulation, learn tools for managing interpersonal relationships. you can find all of that kind of content specifically made for people with ADHD, by ADHDers or mental health professionals (or both), in easily digestible bites of information. there are ADHD groups for advice and accountability, you can even get people to digitally body double for you\n\nnot to mention he clearly has access to doctors and a variety of treatments and he's choosing (for whatever reason) not to get help \n\nwhatever is going on with him, you've described a situation in which he has little to no connection with wife and child and is at every possible moment trying to escape from reality. that's really really really bad\n\nin terms of advice, I'd suggest the following:\n\n1 - if financially they can afford help, or you can afford to get help for them, try to convince your daughter to hire help. whether that's someone to help with cleaning, or using a meal delivery service, or hell even a fluff and fold service. your daughter needs things off her plate YESTERDAY. she also needs some time to unwind where she is not responsible for everyone else. can they get some help with childcare or someone to watch the baby at least once a week? she also needs therapy. I can't even imagine what she's going through right now. and given how defensive she was to your honestly mild reaction, I doubt she's telling anyone how bad things are or even acknowledging it to herself\n\n2 - try and find out what his resistance is to getting help. it could be as simple as being resistant to medication and not knowing that there are other options. finding out what his resistance is may be key to getting him help\n\n3 - your SIL isn't the only one who needs to know that there's help available and that things can be made accessible to him. your daughter also needs to know that and knowing something more concrete than \"help is available\" may be really helpful to her. seeing the kinds of content I talked above may help her identify potential solutions or at least more specific problems. which may be really important to her husband getting help, and also to her raising her expectations for him\n\n4 - apologise to her for how you spoke and respect her boundaries. offer help and make it clear that you'll only help in ways that she's comfortable with. her shutting you out would be really awful - you need to remain a safe space for her", "Not necessarily.

Motivation is a huge struggle point for me, so looking at my phone and seeing I\u2019ve got a quick tick that can be done in under 5 minutes usually gives me the \u2018this seems manageable\u2019 feeling I need to do it and once I\u2019ve got started I can get into a bit of a flow and motivate myself to do the longer ones.", "I have ADHD and I get so overwhelmed just existing that I consciously chose not to have kids. Several of my female friends with ADHD have made the same choice, probably because we know that EVERYTHING would end up being our responsibility and... No. \n\nHOWEVER: I take my medication, I work on my strategies and do my level best to not make my problem someone else's problem. I am also single because I just don't expect someone else to deal with how extra I am. ADHD is not a free pass. If you want to exist like your SIL is doing, do it on your own. If you have a partner, you put in the work. At this point, I feel like it's a safety issue for him to get medication. Your daughter appears to have an extra child at home and that really sucks. \n\nNTA.", "He works full time, that is harder then being a house mom. YTA", "Yes ADHD makes it hard to stay focused, but not impossible. You can\u2019t blame him for how he was born, but you certainly can blame him for doing absolutely nothing to try and improve. If he doesn\u2019t start finding some coping mechanisms i would be worried constantly that he would forget the child was in the car on a hot day, or forget the door was open and the child wandered off. There\u2019s more at stake here than not getting help with chores.", "YATA you have no business in their marriage, you have no business making comments, and you also have no business telling someone they should be medicated or not", "NTA- I have adhd inattentive type. I am glad you spoke up. I agree with someone else that he may be at the end of his capacity from work at the end of the day. It sounds like his adhd is pretty severe. If he doesn\u2019t get help it could impact his job performance and he could even lose his job. If he\u2019s this depleted it can\u2019t feel good to him. Could he have secondary depression because life is hard for him? I\u2019ve read research that many people develop drug and alcohol dependence in an attempt to self medicate. I just have been chunky/ obese with periods of being an average weight my whole life from eating to get dopamine . I\u2019d say you are concerned for him because you want his quality of life to be better.  Maybe say some nice things you don\u2019t really mean because you are frustrated right now. What I do know is that the right medication can be life changing. I\u2019d also guess he could benefit from some therapy to unpack negative thinking about himself and to learn coping strategies. I\u2019ve suffered over 40 years until diagnosis and I can\u2019t ever go back to life without meds. If he were diabetic would he say that\u2019s just life and everyone should be used to him passing out because of blood sugar issues. Etc. ? adhd impacts energy levels , self- esteem , it can make you have rejection sensitivity dysphoria. I\u2019d say you really want him to get help for him. What would he want for his child? To suffer ? He also may be a giant tool- but he\u2019s far more likely to get help if he believes you care about him. Having adhd is nothing to be ashamed about . It can be genetic , it can be caused by things that happen in utero , birth trauma , and traumatic brain injury . Dr . Russel Barclay ( spelling ?) has great YouTube videos . I wish you luck and I hope you can get him to get medical attention . He isn\u2019t being fair to his wife and child . I\u2019m also concerned he\u2019s setting himself up for a break-down . If he does go on meds he need to make sure he talks to the doctor about caffeine, alcohol , vitamin c etc. I can\u2019t take vitamin c because it impacts absorption etc. I\u2019d also recommend he does vitamin d, magnesium and omegas (of course talking to his doctor) . He may even need someone to make the appointment for him. Good luck.", "NTA. He needs to address this to be a present father and partner. Your daughter is a thousand times more patient than I will ever be. \n\nIt needed to be said. You said it. Bravo. \n\nYou can apologize for how you approached it. But I\u2019d never apologize for saying it.", "NTA, except that I fully believe in trying to have a calmer, rational discussion with someone before the repeated issues build up inside you and you snap (which is what it seems like happened here). Though I also understand it\u2019s a tricky dynamic when it\u2019s your daughter\u2019s partner and not your own. As someone who was recently diagnosed with ADHD in my late 20s, I can relate to his struggles of ADHD and adult responsibilities. But it took a lot of personal failures to get to the point of realizing I needed help, and I haven\u2019t had a partner in over 4 years who could have been supporting me and possibly filling in the gaps like your daughter is for him (not that that\u2019s okay). Also even though you are familiar with your own daughter\u2019s ADHD, I don\u2019t think it manifests/presents the exact same way in everyone. That being said, one of my favorite phrases is although mental health issues are not my fault, they are my responsibility. So you are right to point out to him and your daughter that he needs to seek help. The entire \u201cseeking help\u201d process is stressful and difficult on its own, so if you feel a desire to help them further, I found that my own mom helping me navigate the annoying world of insurance/finding a psychiatrist and also holding me accountable was very crucial. Your daughter is lucky to have your support enough to stand up for her when she needs it. I hope you are able to find some resolution with them for a happier future!", "My ex treated me exactly like the husband in this scenario and he didn\u2019t have ADHD or ASD. No one stood up for me, in fact, when I did eventually leave him, everyone told me I was an idiot because he\u2019s handsome and a high earner", "No, we don\u2019t know if the daughter is bothered by it. Just because you think it is \u201cabuse\u201d and not ok, doesn\u2019t mean the daughters thinks so. \nPeople have different ways of accepting and dealing with each other. Every person is different and deals with different life situations differently.", "We all have a limited amount of energy. The difference is some of us want to be helpful and do more than just vegetate. The guy has 0 excuses for not going to get tested and medicated if that\u2019s what he needs to function as an adult. Otherwise he has no business making babies that couldn\u2019t ever get help or care from him. It looks like somebody has to say it, so OP NTA.", "I\u2019m an ADHD parent myself (my kids are ADHD and ASD). As a parent, there is no luxury of just being completely zonked by the time one gets home from work that everything else is majorly neglected. Anyone with executive functioning difficulties needs to pace themselves to avoid daily burn out. \n\nHow does OPs son in law hold a job if his ADHD interferes so much with home aspects of his life? Executive functioning deficits are not specific to one aspect of life. It effects all aspects, so if the Son in law is able to compensate and hold down a job, he\u2019s either created ways to work with his ADHD at work that he should try and incorporate in other areas or he\u2019s just being a jerk.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

If he had ADHD that was that bad, it wouldn't just affect home life, but work life as well. \n\nNot how it goes!! That is not factual ADHD info....\n\nI have ADHD and work as an operating room nurse.  I save lives at work.  I am ON IT at work...   My ADHD doesn't affect my work life negatively... It affects it positively. \n\nAt home...?! I can't even remember to take my own medications...  can't make myself do the physio I need for my disabilities... \n\nAs I love my job so I get lots of dopamine there... I am able to hyper focus and hyper fixate because I love it.\n\nI do not love doing housework and chores.  Zero dopamine there so it is a struggle.\n\nI urge to to actually educate yourself on ADHD, especially since your husband has it.  Because you are NOT speaking correctly about ADHD. \n\nMy teen struggled with it. To understand. Or to accept they too have ADHD.  Following ADHD accounts on Instagram helped us both. Learn about ourselves and also each other (since every ADHD person is different and their ADHD traits can be different etc).   They can also help your husband.  Also for things like workarounds.. little things that can help the executive dysfunction and lack of organising etc.\n\nI'm 42.  I've been needing to get all my jewellery in one place and into a jewellery box... Since I was about 15.  My mum got me a giant jewellery box for Christmas before my kid was even born. She got me it because I was gutted I'd lose all my jewellery all the time (didn't know. I had ADHD).  Even lost special sentimental things.  My kid is 20 this year... I started sorting through my jewellery just a few days ago.  It's still not finished.  But that task has been on my mind and knowing I needed it done for decades... Small minor task.  Just couldn't do it.\n\nIt truly seems batshit... I understand that. It is wild.  The ADHD life.  And how we can do some things with ease and other things it's like wading through mud or impossible...", "Why don't you put him on medication at home? Surely he needs to focus on homework and would like to be able to focus on things he likes as well. Speaking as someone with ADHD who had to go off meds for a neuropsychologist appointment and has missed a few days, days without meds are depressing and I can't do anything. It feels like a grey cloud is over me and I can't think about anything. The days off on the weekend thing isn't recommended anymore since ADHD is by definition affecting school, home, personal relationships, and work. There's no reason to only treat one aspect. Of course he's going to forget things at home if he isn't medicated. If my parents had actually gotten me tested as a child (and not me paying for it at 24...) and only medicated me during the week I'd probably be so upset even now that we'd be NC.", "Saaame! My cats have three water bowls, three litter boxes and I have an app to track their wellbeing.", "Yes this! I only found out at 35 when I was prescribed a stimulant med and it didn\u2019t do a thing. I had my own coping mechanisms that worked for me as a child who didn\u2019t want to be noticed and stay invisible. I\u2019m unmedicated as an adult because I still use my mechanisms - lists, scheduling my day to flow. For example if I have a chore when I come home, I park the car and do the chore. If I get distracted by something else, it just won\u2019t happen. Since we don\u2019t get dopamine for doing things, I give myself little rewards. And alarms. So many alarms and timers.  And here\u2019s the thing, I\u2019m a grown adult, my bills are paid and my pets are fed and my partner (NT) aren\u2019t sitting in a pile of filth.

Adhd is incredibly fatiguing and burns you out far quicker than if you were neurotypical, and it burns you our for far longer. That is, when it's untreated. I do believe adhd can get this bad and he's not weaponising incompetence in that fact that he's not doing work around the house because he \"doesn't want to\", I genuinely believe his adhd is stopping him from doing these tasks to the point of rendering him useless. His weaponised incompetence is more the fact that he is not seeking help for this behaviour, he's not learning coping mechanisms, and he's not trying to get professional help. That is how he is weaponising his incompetence. To recap, is he currently unwillingly incompetent? Yes. Could he fix that and pull his weight? Yes. Is the fact that he's not even trying to seek help making him the asshole? YES YES YES. He needs help, and he is the asshole for leaving his wife (who is disabled in the exact same way) to do everything. She is in danger of being burnt out too. However, he's not just being lazy when he gets home, adhders often have to make compromises that nts don't just to live adult life, and it can lead to horrible work/life balances if not managed correctly.", "Huh. Oh dear, this sounds exactly like me (40F), except I've never considered that I might have ADHD. Just that I perform super well at work and have no energy for anything else.

So if you don\u2019t progress you get let go. All sorts of other issues go with that but it means there aren\u2019t really any slackers! I guess he could be doing that?

Which is what I plan to bring up in part, along with a genuine apology. I\n\nThis seems like the best option now. Assuming it's genuinely ADHD then he might have rejection sensitivity, which would have made the direct confrontation very hard on him. However he's had time to think now and I really hope he realizes that something needs to change. Whether that's more assistance for him, more insight in ADHD, a different job, anything to help him be responsible. \n\nI have a hard time believing he really doesn't see it though.

In no way defending the guy in the post btw, he\u2019s the A,  just saying that motivation and setting priorities are the main problems of most people with adhd.", "Hell, I was diagnosed at 8 and have been medicated since then and I still very much relate to this.
