All of which, he attributes to his ADHD claiming he has \u201cexecutive dysfunction\u201d, or that he gets sidetracked, overwhelmed by multiple chores and starts to get frustrated. She has to call his name over and over again, repeatedly say \u201chello?

If there's an imminent issue in front of my face (like a crying baby) I am able to address that issue, even on my worst days. Don't fall for his crocodile tears.\n\nEdit 2: To me, this has dynamics of an abusive relationship, in which case however you feel about him, you might need to suppress it for the sake of being able to be there to support your daughter and to make sure he's not able to alienate you from your daughter.

If someone hit your daughter, you would have them arrested (correct response) or take them down (emotional knee jerk reaction with negative consequences).

As a non member of the APA or even a MD you have no right to tell someone that. He\u2019s a grown man weather or not he wants to put meds in his body. Is his choice.

ADHD can be draining as all hell and far more disabling than I think you realize, but your daughter's husband is being a bad husband regardless. ADHD is exhausting, but so is running a household with a newborn, and her husband needs to smarten up and see that, and then work towards a solution that accommodates his disability.\n\nHowever, it is never, ever appropriate to offer unsolicited medical advice to a disabled person regardless of their actions. I'll give you a little leeway because it must be incredibly hard to see your daughter neglected like that, but what you said was rude and ableist. It also sounds like you don't really know what going on ADHD meds entails and think it's a one and done solution. Finding the right psych med can take years, and the time spent finding the right one can be not only incredibly frustrating but is also usually riddled with side effects. The first time we switched my ADHD meds, I was completely out of my mind and basically non-functional for three weeks until we decided that dramatic mood swings and being unable to eat without dry heaving were preferable and switched me back to my old med. You were right to call your SIL out, but the meds comment was uncalled for and totally uninformed. Meds might help with some things, but that's his choice to make, and what they need more than that is to work with a psychologist or professional to find a sustainable solution to their current situation. If he's not willing to do that, then that's not the ADHD's fault and he's just a deadbeat.", "YTA. Need to keep your nose out.", "None of your business, boomer.", "YTA\n\nThis is NOT your relationship.
