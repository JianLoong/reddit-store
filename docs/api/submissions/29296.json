When you've sent to shop food for animal, it's completely normal to get some treats too. But yeah, it would be good to ask before giving anything new, in case there are allergies etc. - but those should be informed by the owner. And the cat isn't going to get overweight in few days.", "NTA - Unless you were specifically told that the cat had a restricted diet then how were you to know?  One or two treats is very reasonable in that time period for a normal cat.", "NTA  Two treats while the cat was on a nice little vacation from your girlfriend will not make the cat obese (Your girlfriend is a bit much!).", "NTA. If it was that important they would\u2019ve mentioned it beforehand. Plus, two churus in a span of five days is not gonna affect the cat\u2019s weight at all.", "NTA\n\nYou did a good thing by feeding the cat and making sure it didn't starve.", "NTA- Poor kitty, she goes oot and leaves the kitty, you were just giving her comfort while her humans were gone! Your GF is being ungrateful and ridiculous!", "NTA\n\nPls show this to your gf. We take \"vaccation guests\" in regulary.\n\nIf you give a pet in someone else care, you bring the following with you when dropping off the pet:\n\n- enough food and a list how much the pet should get at what time)\n- the pets paperwork or passport\n- the information who the vet is, under what name the pet is registered there and which emergency vets already have files about the pet under which name\n- a list with what is normal (like missy doesn't finish breakfast usually but will eat it later - so i don't worry when the pet isn't eating their breakfast) and with alkergies, dos and don'ts\n\nYour gf obviously already failed at point 1 - she has to do alot better if she really cares about her pet.", "NTA\n\nWhy didn\u2019t she give you supplies to watch her cat? I hope she gave you money to pay your dad back.", "NTA. Unless the cat already has weight issues, weight watching a cat is an absurd thing to do. If the cat did have weight issues, a diet would have been prescribed by the vet.", "ESH\n\nYou suck because you chose to feed someone else's pet some food that you were not asked to feed them. You didn't check. That's never a good idea, however it's a mild overstep.\n\nShe and her parents REALLY suck. They asked you to house their cat for 5 days, didn't give you food and instructions of how much to feed her, and tell you not to give her treats? And why were you housing the cat? Cats are much better in their own surroundings. They should have just asked you to go over to feed Ginny and spend time with her each day. Then you leave. I literally just cat-sat for someone. I would go over in the morning, feed the two cats, make sure they had water, and then leave. In the evening I would repeat the process, but then I'd get to give them some treats (owner approved), hang with the cats for a bit, wear them out playing with their toys, then leave. All the food and treats were there with instructions and the phone number for their vet in case of emergency.", "ESH - you don\u2019t feed other\u2019s pets without asking owner. Owner, on the other hand, should tell you that beforehand.", "NTA that cat can have a treat every once in a while, she\u2019s over zealous but at least it\u2019s because she\u2019s trying to take care of her pet", "NTA\n\nAnd sheba ist one of the worst", "YTA.\n\nNever feed someone else's pet anything without first consulting the owner. The pet might have allergies or other sensitive health conditions that you're unaware of.\n\nI realize, at least, you didn't go overboard on the treats, but please be aware that your girlfriend has the only say as to what her cat eats.\n\nAfter this, you should ask first.", "Is she overweight at all? I love it when overweight people bleat on about how their pets can\u2019t have the smallest morsel of treat food and then stuff their face with 1000 calories of garbage in the very next breath.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We (myself and ex gf) couldn't figure out why. Angel developed a blockage and it was around $2,000 in vet bills to diagnose and remove the blockage. Come to find out my mom was feeding Angel some junk cat treats. We stopped the junky treats and Angel never had crystals again.", "What?? Overweight  form treats? Does she not realize that she can control the amount she gives the cat? My cats get treats 3 times are day (temptations) and are perfectly  healthy", "Then his girlfriend should have provided instruction, like any responsible pet owner.
