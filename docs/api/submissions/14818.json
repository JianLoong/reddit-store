It's a restaurant... order whatever the hell you want. Guarantee your sister doesn't actually think you're wrong either, she just doesn't want to admit her bf is and feels she needs to take his side cuz he got upset. Honestly, he's almost 30 and that's a child's mentality (NO! You can't have that cuz I want it! No! I don't want to match with anyone else!).

I have NEVER heard of any etiquette that states no one at the table can order the same thing.

Him being upset that someone ordered the same dish he wanted is beyond that etiquette standard. For some reason I feel like if your father-in-law would have ordered the same dish it wouldn\u2019t be an issue. He didn\u2019t seem bothered that others in the restaurant might have been (probably were) ordering the same dish. If I was your husband I would be asking sister to explain in painstaking detail how it is rude to order something that someone else intends to order. If she claims it\u2019s rude, show the etiquette guide stating that if someone else at the table wants to order the same dish as you then you\u2019re required to change your order. My senses are tingling that this isn\u2019t an issue of someone at the table ordered the same thing but that YOU ordered the same thing.

I knew what I wanted to order, and my sister wanted the same thing, but at the last second she changed her mind and got something else. Her reasoning was that it's better to see a variety of plates/meals and kind of feels like a wasted opportunity if two people order the same thing. I get it, but she was envious of my delicious Thai peanut wrap and all I could think was, her own head put her in that disappointing situation. She never wants to order the same thing someone else orders (whether it's a restaurant or Starbucks) and it has happened several times where she's disappointed in her choice and I'm enjoying my delicious choice.

Order whatever you want.", "NTA \n\nDid you go out to eat with Brian? \n\n(You can skip ahead to 2:09) \n\nhttps://youtu.be/5drqH5OdETY", "NTA this is really weird.", "NTA Absolutely nothing wrong with ordering the food you want. Going to restaurants with these types of people is fucking awful.", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 Tbh, this isn\u2019t just about a silly dispute or difference of opinion. This behavior is potentially much deeper. Be watchful and contemplative.", "Seriously!?  NTA!   I have NEVER heard of not ordering the same as someone else in your group.  In fact, I have been out with friends/family where we have all ended up ordering the same thing and then had a laugh about it.", "NTA. Your sister and her BF know you can't catch gay by ordering the same food, right?\n\nNot sure if they're homophobes, but couldn't think of any other rational reason they'd have for this behaviour", "Lol NTA, I have had tables all order the same thing\u2026 if your SIL is only being swayed by her BF she needs to leave him because that\u2019s very weird", "NTA - her bf is nuts. Once in a rare while when we're on the other side of town we go to this place with great prime rib - both of us order the prime rib - medium rare. If I wasn't able to have my prime rib because he ordered it first there would be hell to pay.", "I don\u2019t understand even the slighted notion that people can\u2019t order the same thing, but it\u2019s come up a few times in this forum.", "Thank you for describing how I felt! OP NTA for the reasons \ud83d\udc46", "It's like a lost episode of *Seinfeld*.  If this happened to me I would first assume I was being pranked... dude is bizarre and SIL is dumb for pandering to his act.", "Funnily enough, I hate when my partner and I get the same food. Mostly because I selfishly want to try their (different) food food too. But, I've gone out to lunch where 4 of us all ordered the same thing. Who cares what someone else is eating?", "My FIL says I'm a \"good orderer\"and he has me order first so he can decide if what he originally wanted sounds better or if he's going to get what I'm getting.\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nThe whole table could order the same thing. Who cares??", "I was on a cruise once and literally our entire table all ordered the exact same dish combination. No one cared. This is so ridiculous to get upset about. It\u2019s a menu, not text-based musical chairs.", "If that was a prank, that is on the \"What the hell is a potato?\" level.", "Please reach out to this sub population and report back, why???", "But he didn\u2019t do that. He wanted her to change her order.", "I don't think a neurodivergent person would be overly concerned about what someone else was ordering, I am and I would be the type to have to get the same thing every time. I don't care at all what other people get and don't understand what this person's issue is. \n\nI dated a narcissist and this seems like something he would do. He would get angry over imagined slights and was over concerned about what people though even though no one was bothered but him.", "I too have never heard of such thing.  More likely to hear, \"I'll have the Angus steak with baked potato and veggies too.\"  Nobody gives a flip if someone orders the same thing.   Maybe he had siblings who would get mad at each other for ordering THEIR choice.  I just can't fathom why he was so upset.", "It came up in American media when President Biden and Dr. Biden went to dinner and got the same pasta. Like grown adults can't just eat what they fucking like, it has to be some choreographed dining process.

It started at a chinese restaurant because everyone shares their dish, so it makes sense to get different stuff. \n\nSomehow that then carried over to all other restaurants. Mostly because I like to try a lot of things, and most of my family and friends would let me take a bite of their food if I wanted to try. So I never wanted to order the same thing as others so I could taste everything. \n\nI\u2019m over it now, but i do like to quiz people about what they\u2019re going to order, just out of enthusiasm for food.", "Right?  I frequently order the same thing as other people usually because we are all not that adventurous and get your basic safe fare.\n\nThen we spend half the meal talking about what we are eating.", "It'd be someone Elaine dated. There'd be a side plot where Kramer misunderstands and starts ordering increasingly weird off-menu meals under the impression it's good manners to order something nobody has ever had before.", "It is in Seinfeld! Pretty sure when Jerry is dating Courtney Cox 's character and they both want to order pancakes and he says that he can't now because she is going to.", "Exactly \u2014 the only time I care what someone else is eating is if I want to share, lol. Who is so invested in what their dining companion is getting otherwise??", "This! At our big family dinners we tend to go to a steakhouse cause we live in a small town with not many options and I swear half of us order the same thing. Weird thing to be upset about!", "My wife and I almost always order to split our meals with each other so I agree, makes no sense to order the same thing.", "This is why I like Chinese style plating(?) where all the dishes are in the middle and everyone just takes what they want into their own bowl of rice. Also solves a lot of problems for picky eaters like me since I can only take what I want.", "Exactly.  This is just strange and not in a good way.", ">siblings who would get mad at each other for ordering THEIR choice\n\nHaving a 3 and 5 year old, can confirm they'll fight about anything... \n\nThe SILs boyfriend is supposed to be an adult though, this is just fucking weird", "Right? A degustation (what I think you're referring to) is generally very expensive and fine dining.", "That definitely has to be up there in first world problems. Who cares if 2 people like the same foods \ud83d\ude44", "Joey doesn't share food!!!", "It was crazy expensive when we went but the owner sold me her car, so she threw dinner in and we just tipped! If we weren't in the IVF process, I had intended to take my husband back for graduation from grad school. Maybe for an anniversary."]}
