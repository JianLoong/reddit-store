For some reason I feel like if your father-in-law would have ordered the same dish it wouldn\u2019t be an issue. He didn\u2019t seem bothered that others in the restaurant might have been (probably were) ordering the same dish. If I was your husband I would be asking sister to explain in painstaking detail how it is rude to order something that someone else intends to order. If she claims it\u2019s rude, show the etiquette guide stating that if someone else at the table wants to order the same dish as you then you\u2019re required to change your order. My senses are tingling that this isn\u2019t an issue of someone at the table ordered the same thing but that YOU ordered the same thing.

Her reasoning was that it's better to see a variety of plates/meals and kind of feels like a wasted opportunity if two people order the same thing. I get it, but she was envious of my delicious Thai peanut wrap and all I could think was, her own head put her in that disappointing situation. She never wants to order the same thing someone else orders (whether it's a restaurant or Starbucks) and it has happened several times where she's disappointed in her choice and I'm enjoying my delicious choice.

It ends with a strangely dramatic breakup where Elaine, confused tells Jerry that that Peter broke up for ordering the same turkey club.", "I read this in their voices. Amazing job!", "You need to add this to r/redditwritesseinfeld", "I always order last because I never know what I want, and I\u2019ve been known to say \u201coh, that sounds good! I\u2019ll have that too!\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know I was being an asshole.", "Good luck on the IVF!", "Not who you asked, but one old piece of etiquette that we today would find really weird is the seating charts at an event or large fancy home dinner.  Per etiquette, the host *purposely* splits up couples around the table, to facilitate the guests all talking to new people.  \n\nIt does make a bizarre sort of sense, in that the party is more lively when people are talking to everyone around them, instead of supposedly just huddled with their partner.  And since it was known etiquette, everyone going to the event would know their social obligations to the host to be a good guest and talk to people.  I think it also put everyone on an even footing; a newcomer to the group, like a new girlfriend/boyfriend, wouldn't feel quite as outnumbered when surrounded by the whole gang.  \n\nAs someone who used general old school etiquette to grow out of my social anxiety, I liked having these clear expectations of behavior ahead of time.  I knew what to do, and could plan and mentally prepare for it.  The best etiquette for today IMO is when out on a date/business dinner, or somewhere that someone else is paying for you, let the host order first and follow their lead.  For example, if they order the expensive special, then you're free to do the same.", "Yeah.  One min they're best friends and the next they can't stand one another... but don't let anyone else mess with the other... there will be hell to pay", "Lol if it's such good BBQ then it *should* have good chicken!", "Meh, I could take them....", "Omg I wanted to go there so bad. Broke my heart when it came out that they were underpaying their staff", "Thank you! It started with \"let's make this baby so they're born right after you graduate!\" And life was like, \"you like cancer? Cause that's what you're having instead of a baby.\" Now we're going into Year 4 of can we make a sibling, but I feel this baby is meant to be after saving my life, because I have PCOS which gave doctors excuses for irregular bleeding. If we'd never tried, my cancer would have been ignored to death.", "That's really interesting, thank you!", "Yeah we went long before that. It was so nice but mission to find it in that stupid hotel complex lol. It had only just been turned from the fat duck satellite to dinner when we went so wasn't any controversy yet", "Thank you", "Holy fuck. You are fantastic at discerning information! Gives new meaning to reading between the lines.", "I get jerk chicken!!", "Its a set menu, no substitutions. NTA OP, this is bizzare."]}
