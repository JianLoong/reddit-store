She is TA for putting it on you and the favor was nowhere near the same.", "Nta, she made a bad decision to not pay attention to her job and got someone hurt, she needs to live with the consequences.

She did something that mildly inconvenienced her for a couple hours at most, but she\u2019s asking you to take responsibility for her seriously messing up at work.  I don\u2019t know why she thinks this wouldn\u2019t get you both fired - employees doing dangerous things at the rink (which this obviously was, if she injured someone) opens the rink up to liability.  Businesses don\u2019t want to be liable for employees pulling dumb stunts.

She PHYSICALLY HURT A PERSON.\n\nWhere is the compassion for this person? It sounds like she's trying to cover her arse more than begging for forgiveness.
