Don\u2019t risk it at all. It\u2019s not your fault, so don\u2019t blame yourself. \n\nBtw, you owed her a shift, not your entire job. She is weaponising that against u, so don\u2019t fall for it. \n\nAgain, NTA!", "Yeah, \u201cowing one\u201d to somebody doesn\u2019t entail losing your job along with them. NTA", "NTA. Usually,  \"owing\" a favour is pretty much \"like for like\" or at a similar level of inconvenience.  She's asking you to give up your job, and it sounds rather manipulative to hold a basic favour over your head", "Nta. Owing her one would be filling in a shift she needed off, coming in early, staying late, etc. NOT lying and possibly losing your job to cover up a huge indiscretion on her part!!! She broke the rules. She got someone hurt/injured. She got fired.", "NTA\n\nShe was sacked for good reason! She had a responsibility to look out for people falling. It was going to be a tough day with one of your team away so she had responsibility to be extra diligent!\n\nInstead she decided to mess about for her tiktok, not only failing to do her job but actually causing an injury! She was sacked because there's no way for the boss to know this won't happen again, and she's a liability.\n\nAlso, it wouldn't have done anything. Even if the boss thinks it was your idea, she's still sacked for the above reasons, and you'll be in the doghouse for a while, at best.", "NTA.  Did she do this during a public skate?  Former figure skater here.  It's very clear at most arenas that no figure skating is allowed whatsoever during public skates specifically for this reason and if she worked there, she definitely knew better and should have been fired.  She is TA for putting it on you and the favor was nowhere near the same.", "Nta, she made a bad decision to not pay attention to her job and got someone hurt, she needs to live with the consequences. Oweing her one is picking up a shift so she can leave early or have off or cleaning the bathrooms for her when they're particularly gross one day, not risking getting fired so that maybe he doesn't fire her.", "These favors are not at all the same in terms of how much you were each asking.  She did something that mildly inconvenienced her for a couple hours at most, but she\u2019s asking you to take responsibility for her seriously messing up at work.  I don\u2019t know why she thinks this wouldn\u2019t get you both fired - employees doing dangerous things at the rink (which this obviously was, if she injured someone) opens the rink up to liability.  Businesses don\u2019t want to be liable for employees pulling dumb stunts.  At best, you would damage your reputation with your boss and have a black mark beside your name, meaning that anything bad that happens in the future is likely to be treated more harshly.  I think it\u2019s more likely you\u2019d both get the boot because of the poor judgement in endangering customers.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. The favor is not athe the same level and will inconvenience you greatly. Its good that you were firm in saying NO!", "NTA. The two aren't comparable.\n\nI assume she was paid for covering you, so yes it's a favour, but not one that risked her job by accepting.\n\nThis one does risk your job (even if she disagrees), it certainly paints you in a bad light and could impact your relationship with your boss.\n\nPlus, what she did was wrong and she needs to accept the responsibility for it.\n\nShe injured someone. She PHYSICALLY HURT A PERSON.\n\nWhere is the compassion for this person? It sounds like she's trying to cover her arse more than begging for forgiveness. This person could sue her boss, and should sue her or file police charges - think of this as being as bad as texting while driving.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Putting some of the blame on yourself wouldn't have saved her job. It could have potentially cost you your job though. It would have been all risk and no reward. Not only that, but what she did was actually really stupid and dangerous and likely cost your boss a lot of money too. You don't need a friend like her.
