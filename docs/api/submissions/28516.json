It is very important for us that everyone at our wedding has at least one entree and one side that they can eat, so we sent out an RSVP form for everyone to fill in their dietary needs/restrictions. We were initially planning on offering items with meat and dairy, as well as vegan options, but an overwhelming number of our guests were vegetarian, vegan, lactose intolerant, celiac, allergic to nuts, etc, which threw us through a loop. Looking at the responses to our form, Richard and I decided the easiest thing to do would be to forgo the meat options on our menu, since the smallest amount of people would be able to eat those. Richard and I are used to being the last thing on people\u2019s mind when planning an event. \n\nWhen I told mother what was on the menu, however, she flipped out. For background, my parents were both raised in rural America and most of my family doesn't understand the concept of veganism. She told me that I would upset the entire family if I didn\u2019t offer at least one option with meat. She suggested I have a couple meat and dairy options and then one option that is completely vegan and allergen free. For me, that has always been an absolute no because as a vegetarian who really likes cheese and bread I don\u2019t want to be stuck eating something gluten free. Plus, one of the items Richard was really excited about has peanut sauce. I explained to her it makes no sense to take off menu items that most people can eat and put in menu items that a lot of people CAN\u2019T eat. I also told her I wanted to space out the allergen free foods on the menu because let\u2019s face it\u2013no completely allergen free food tastes good. My mother told me that I would be alienating the entire family if I didn\u2019t include meat items on the menu. I basically snapped and told her she could either pay for food with meat in it, suck it up and go an evening without eating meat, or skip my wedding altogether. (Currently my family is not contributing to my wedding financially.)\n\nNow, my mother hasn\u2019t spoken to me for a couple of days and I have several family members texting me and trying to \u201creason\u201d with me. A couple of them have told me they won\u2019t be attending my wedding unless I add some meat options to the menu. Richard is on my side and says since it\u2019s our wedding and my family is not contributing, we get to call the shots, and if someone refuses to come because of what\u2019s on the menu then good riddance. But I want an unbiased opinion. AM I being unreasonable?

It is very important for us that everyone at our wedding has at least one entree and one side that they can eat, so we sent out an RSVP form for everyone to fill in their dietary needs/restrictions. We were initially planning on offering items with meat and dairy, as well as vegan options, but an overwhelming number of our guests were vegetarian, vegan, lactose intolerant, celiac, allergic to nuts, etc, which threw us through a loop. Looking at the responses to our form, Richard and I decided the easiest thing to do would be to forgo the meat options on our menu, since the smallest amount of people would be able to eat those. Richard and I are used to being the last thing on people\u2019s mind when planning an event. \n\nWhen I told mother what was on the menu, however, she flipped out. For background, my parents were both raised in rural America and most of my family doesn't understand the concept of veganism. She told me that I would upset the entire family if I didn\u2019t offer at least one option with meat. She suggested I have a couple meat and dairy options and then one option that is completely vegan and allergen free. For me, that has always been an absolute no because as a vegetarian who really likes cheese and bread I don\u2019t want to be stuck eating something gluten free. Plus, one of the items Richard was really excited about has peanut sauce. I explained to her it makes no sense to take off menu items that most people can eat and put in menu items that a lot of people CAN\u2019T eat. I also told her I wanted to space out the allergen free foods on the menu because let\u2019s face it\u2013no completely allergen free food tastes good. My mother told me that I would be alienating the entire family if I didn\u2019t include meat items on the menu. I basically snapped and told her she could either pay for food with meat in it, suck it up and go an evening without eating meat, or skip my wedding altogether. (Currently my family is not contributing to my wedding financially.)\n\nNow, my mother hasn\u2019t spoken to me for a couple of days and I have several family members texting me and trying to \u201creason\u201d with me. A couple of them have told me they won\u2019t be attending my wedding unless I add some meat options to the menu. Richard is on my side and says since it\u2019s our wedding and my family is not contributing, we get to call the shots, and if someone refuses to come because of what\u2019s on the menu then good riddance.

You were going to do it and then you realize most everyone didn't want meat so why should you pay for meat for a handful of people.
