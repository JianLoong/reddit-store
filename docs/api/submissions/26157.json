My sister (15f) has been facing issues with privacy I find unacceptable.\n\nWe live in a house that is semi connected to the next house, where my uncle, aunt, and cousins (12f, 9m). My sister's room has 2 doors, one coming from our house and one coming from our uncle's. This has enabled our cousins to enter freely, often walking in on her. My uncle has also walked in on her changing, but she was thankfully blocked by her closet door.\n\nHer bedroom door is always shut, they just enter without knocking first no matter how many times they're asked to knock. The female cousin also frequently comes in when my sister is away to rifle through her clothes, jewellery, etc.\n\nOur mother is also not respectful of privacy, frequently picking up any private diary or journal she sees. I have long since stopped writing sensitive things down on paper. However I have caught her going through my sisters things. We are not allowed to lock our doors or drawers and even our bathrooms have no lock (our parents bathroom does have a lock, how funny).\n\nSo here is where I might be the asshole. I stole the keys to her bedroom from the keyring of house keys. I also found the key to her locking study desk drawer. My sister has been locking her door and drawer and is happy.\n\nHowever, my parents say we have no right to lock doors without permission and that they have a right to access our belongings for safety and we cannot lock them away. (Also, I have been responsible for monitoring my sisters Internet usage, friends etc for years so not sure why they are protesting her locking her diary). It is also apparently unsafe to keep doors locked for most of the time, although I have never heard of this rule.\n\nBefore she moved in, her bedroom was used as a sort of walkway to get between our houses. Now our cousins complain every time they need to knock and wait for the door to be unlocked so they can come hang out with us or watch football. Our parents and uncle are also annoyed they have to use the front doors to get to each others houses.\n\nSo, AITA for taking my sisters bedroom door keys?\n\nedit: I took the key FROM OUR PARENTS so that she could use the key to lock her door. I'm not preventing her from locking it. My parents r mad because she \"can't keep the door locked when its their house she's living in\".", "created_utc": 1693774958, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16988ny/aita_for_stealing_my_parents_keys_to_my_sisters/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You definitely have the right to privacy, and if that's not respected, locks are acceptable. **NTA**", "Info: Now that you are leaving is there a different room she can move to (your room?) that doesn't connect to both sides of the house and would allow her more privacy?", "NTA as OP stole the key so sister can have some privacy. (Edited. Original below)\n\n\nINFO did you steal the keys so noone has a key to UNLOCK her door that all they wander through, or so she can't lock her door?\n\nShe deserves privacy, not sleeping in an open access hallway. Your relatives all sound like disrespectful AHs", "NTA and can she move into your room while you are gone?", "This sounds disturbing!  Good Lord, your sister is a teen girl and people walk into her room at any time??  Her cousins (!) are allowed to walk in and rifle through her belongings, her uncle can walk into her room at any time (!! So creepy!!), and your parents read her private thoughts in her diary?  You both need to get out of there.\n\nYou're NTA for taking the key so that she has privacy and good on you for trying to introduce some sanity into the situation.  However, I don't think it's the solution.  Your parents are going to get new locks or find another key at some point.\n\nThe whole point of being a teen is to start developing independence.  Your sister needs a space where she can get changed and think private thoughts without worrying that someone will burst in on her.  There is absolutely no reason to have an open-door policy into a teens bedroom and ESPECIALLY not one that allows uncles and cousins into the room at any time.  That's a violation.\n\nIf you parents want your uncle to be able to walk into their house at any time, they should take the room with the door to his house.  If I knew your family and I knew the uncle was walking into a teen girl's room at random times, I'd be tempted to report him to CPS or your sister's school.\n\nYou're only 18.  All you can do is encourage your sister to study hard so she can get out of there as soon as possible to a good college, where she can become financially independent.  Maybe you can invite her to visit you sometimes when you're at college so she can get a break from your household.  Good luck.", "NTA and good for you for looking out for your sister. The adults here are being ridiculously controlling and disrespectful of your sister. I hope your sister can move into your room when you go to uni so she no longer has to deal with living in a \"public\" walkway.", "If I lived in a room like that, I'd immediately move the heaviest piece of furniture in front of the cousins' door. \n\nNTA", "NTA but also get her doorstops in case your parents get the keys back and make copies. Also tell her to use a digital diary that is password protected instead. \n\nYou should help prepare for her to want to move out as soon as she reaches 18.", "NTA\n\nWell done", "NTA in theory but they are just going to take the keys back from her in time. Why don\u2019t you have her move into your room so she isn\u2019t in the passage room?", "NTA.\n\nI have so, so many words, but I'm going to just leave it at good job to you for looking out for her.  Everyone else... I have nothing good to say.", "That people are walking in on her while she's changing--I say it's desperate but protective action so good for you.\n\nnta", "Your parents are just going to make another copy.\n\nAs long as she's in that room there's no fixing this. You could nail the door shut to the uncle's house and your parents would just remove the boards.\n\nGet her a trunk that locks to keep her stuff in. Door wedges or door knob jammers that she can use while she's in the room. (Though parents are likely to come in and take them.)\n\nNTA\n\n\nIsn't your room going to be free? Why can't she move into it?", "Edit: NTA upon reading OP's edit.\n\n~~YTA. Your sister has the right to some basic human fucking privacy.
