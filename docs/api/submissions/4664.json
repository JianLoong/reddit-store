So, I told her that I didn't like the sweater and that I would prefer if she just gave me money instead.\n\nWhen I made this request, my mom started crying and brought up my gambling habit. She reminded me that I have a problem and that I shouldn't be asking for money when I have \"a tendency to waste it on gambling.\"\n\nI've become a lot smarter with my gambling in recent months so I was blown away that she brought this up. I know that my mom was just trying to look out for me, but in the moment, I was just frustrated and hurt. I didn't mean to make her cry, and I definitely didn't mean to have the subject of gambling brought up.
