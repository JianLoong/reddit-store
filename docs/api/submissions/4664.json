So, I told her that I didn't like the sweater and that I would prefer if she just gave me money instead.\n\nWhen I made this request, my mom started crying and brought up my gambling habit. She reminded me that I have a problem and that I shouldn't be asking for money when I have \"a tendency to waste it on gambling.\"\n\nI've become a lot smarter with my gambling in recent months so I was blown away that she brought this up. I know that my mom was just trying to look out for me, but in the moment, I was just frustrated and hurt. I didn't mean to make her cry, and I definitely didn't mean to have the subject of gambling brought up. But at the same time, I feel like I was justified in wanting something that would be more practical for me.\n\nI'm not sure if I was in the wrong for telling my mom that her gift wasn't good enough, because it genuinely was not very useful to me.\n\n**TL;DR: Told my mom her Christmas present wouldn't cut it and I'd prefer money, she got upset at me.**", "created_utc": 1670970790, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zl97uw/aita_for_finding_my_moms_christmas_present_ahead/", "score": 228, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
