I know I just am not one of those genetically gifted people that can eat a bunch and it never shows. So I've stuck to a calorie limit a day.

I know all to well how they can be. The subtle comments and the jabs. When everyone's plate is getting filled up they put a little bit less on your plate. If you go to grab a big portion of dessert they are like \"are you sure?\" My sister put on weight from depression/stress/anxiety reasons. My grandparents are slick about how they make their comments so there is never really a time to tell them to stop. I did privately ask them to stop doing what they did to me.

She asked me if I could eat more brownies, get seconds, and order less healthy meals while we're out. I asked her why and she said so she doesn't look like the only one eating badly.

This situation is horrible, and will lead to disordered eating. Your sister has to focus on her own food, and body. She can't make someone else change to suit her needs.", "NTA, and your extended family sucks here, especially your grandparents. \n\nI honestly feel for your sister here - she was out of line to ask you what she did, but ugh, I have so much sympathy for her having to listen to your grandparents' awful comments while already feeling self-conscious about the weight gain. \n\nThe next time your grandparents - or anyone in your family - has anything to say about weight/food, no matter how \"slick\", I hope you or your sister call them out directly, in front of people. They may feign innocence, but part of how people get away with this shit is that no one ever calls it out because they don't want to look like the instigator. Fuck that. \n\nThis is setting your sister up for a bad time and some disordered eating if it doesn't stop. So awful.", "NTA, but continue to be supportive of your sister.", "NTA\n\nThis sounds like an eating disorder in the making, so please consider talking to her or getting her to talk with a professional. She can't expect everyone around her to change their eating habits to accommodate hers.", "NTA, it's your grandparents habits that need to change, not yours.", "NTA, the only assholes here are the grandparents. They are hammering home that your sister isn't doing well and making her more self-conscious than she, probably, already feels. Maybe tell your sister how talking to them helped you when they were making those comments to you.", "NTA.\n\n>She asked me if I could eat more brownies, get seconds, and order less healthy meals while we're out.\n\nThis is really unreasonable. You aren't doing anything wrong.", "NTA of course\n\nI feel for your sister because your grandparents sound heinous. However the solution is not to give them two targets to attack. You both should be able to eat what feels good for you without comments from others", "NTA\n\nYou're right not to do something that is both bad for you and not what you want to do, but maybe find a different way to show her she's loved just the way she is? With that kind of bullying and the new insecurities brought on by her weight, she probably just wants support and to feel like she's not alone.", "NTA\n\nThey're just brownies, Monica. They aren't love.", "NTA. Just let your sister know that your food habits are something that you have come up with over the years. If she wants you to help her eat better, you can explain what you eat and why.", "NTA- but your grandparents are.", "NTA, it sounds like she\u2019s developing an eating disorder and probably needs to see someone", "NTA.... You eat what is best for your body.  It sounds like you are supportive of her doing her own thing.", "NTA. She wants you to gain the weight back", "This is some sick shit your sister has put on weight, but she wants you to eat like she does so she doesn't seem like what exactly? Your sister's issues are her own, please don't give into that trap it won't help her or you in the long run. She wasn't trying to make you feel better when you were heavier by matching what you ate, extend her the same courtesy. NTA btw, let her wallow in her self pity and tell her to not involve you in it.", "NTA.  Your grandparents are really cruel, and they need to be called out EVERY time.  Are your parents present - do they intervene?   My MIL (likely now in hell) consistently made comments about my children being overweight, and I called her out - eventually went NC.  Decades later, my kids still remember the comments, and being defended/supported by their parents.   \n\nI'm concerned about your sister, and her way of thinking - wants you to eat more so that she doesn't look like the only one.  She has eating issues/disorder, whether related to her anxiety/depression - bottom line she needs support.   And you eat what you want", "NTA, but you and your sister need to have a conversation about calling out these \u201cslick\u201d comments. Make a mutual agreement to always call them out right then and there the moment they happen, no matter who makes them, and to always back the other up. Your family needs to know that that behavior is unacceptable. \n\nShe\u2019s only been feeling like this because your family is making her feel like she should, which is insane given that it\u2019s related to her other health issues, and you know how they effected your own self-esteem. This is not a you vs her issue, it\u2019s a both of you vs your family\u2019s fat shaming issue.", "Obviously NTA, but do you really not know why she wants you to eat that stuff? It's seems pretty clear, so I'm not sure why you're questioning it. She wants you, the skinny one now, to eat the same things as she does, so that nobody can say (and I can guarantee you the \"slick\" comments have already been made to her), \"I just don't understand. Look at your sister. She only eats x, y, and z. Why can't you eat x, y, and z? Why do you have to eat x, x, y, y, z, and z and then go back for seconds? No wonder she's skinny and you're fat.\"", "NAH because neither you nor your sister are the AHs here, and I think that\u2019s what your title is asking us to judge.\n\nYour grandparents, though? Hoo boy. AHs to infinity and beyond.", "1) never assume a dish eating out is healthier than another, it probably isn't\n\n2) you could have made this post a lot shorter without the humble bragging about how in control you are \n\nNTA but don't make out like you're in so much more control than she is, makes me wonder whether you comment too without meaning to. Like, all you've said is she's sad about her weight, ate the same thing as you once and got some mean comments from grandparents, I don't even see the AITA bit here. Chances are if she's asked you those questions you've been unwittingly showing off your own self-control.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
