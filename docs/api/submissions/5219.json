{"id": 5219, "submission_id": "zqsye0", "title": "AITA for banning my friend's SO from future parties?", "selftext": "I (mid-thirties man) have a good friend from college who had been dating a woman for a few years. She and I have had our differences in the past; for example, we got into an argument about Taylor Swift: she claimed that the only reason people don't like her is because they are sexist; I suggested that there may be other reasons people don't like her (e.g., she is overplayed). The argument ended in me being called sexist myself. (For the record, I actually like T-Swift.)\n\nThis past summer, I hosted a gathering of friend's at a relative's house upstate. I invited my friend and his SO to the gathering. I saw it as an opportunity to resolve our differences so I made an extra effort to make sure they felt comfortable (e.g., by reserving for them the best room in the house).\n\nThat evening we were all hanging out in the basement and I received a notification on my phone saying I had recently been in contact with someone who'd contracted the new global pathogen. I jokingly asked the group if anyone else had received these notifications, and mentioned I had received several of these over the past few days.\n\nEveryone else in the room said they hadn't received any notifications. Then my friend's SO said that she thought I was being very disrespectful by informing everyone of this fact in such a casual manner.\n\nI said that the likely reason I received the notifications was that I had been on a plane earlier that week, but that I had been wearing face protection so it wasn't a cause for concern. I also reminded her that I had insisted everyone be inoculated before attending the party and that I myself had taken a swab earlier that morning just to be extra cautious.\n\nShe continued to insist that I was being disrespectful, and things got awkward and the vibe in the room changed.\n\nLater, I approached her privately to try to clear the air. She repeatedly said that I needed to be \"taken to task\" for my behavior. I listened and eventually we clinked glasses and agreed to put the issue behind us.\n\nThen the next day, I found out from another friend of mine that, after our initial altercation (but before our private meeting) she had overheard this woman say to someone else that I was an \"asshole.\"\n\nIn my view, this crossed the line. It is one thing to call someone out for perceived inappropriate behavior; it is another to badmouth them behind their back at their own party. I don't want to surround myself with people who have such little respect for me.\n\nThe following day I sent my friend a text that said, \"I have some tough news to convey, which is that \\[name\\] is no longer welcome at parties I throw in the future. I'm happy to explain my reasoning in greater detail....Please know I love you like a brother and have no ill will toward you whatsoever.\"\n\nMy friend hasn't spoken to me since.\n\nI'm conflicted. On one hand, I think I am justified in closing my door to someone who clearly doesn't respect me. On the other hand, maybe I am overreacting.\n\nWhat do you think, Reddit?", "created_utc": 1671554215, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqsye0/aita_for_banning_my_friends_so_from_future_parties/", "score": 267, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have had several of these interactions that you\u2019re describing, where she objects to something I\u2019ve said that\u2019s ultimately harmless, but to her it\u2019s like a black and white issue that she must make known to me how wrong she thinks I am. Wont let me finish a sentence when I try to respond to her objection\u2026 Regardless of who someone like that is, like a coworker, or a mild acquaintance, it sucks to be around someone who is consistently confrontational or quarrelsome.

People will have opinions of you. Singling her out life that (no invite) is a bad move on your part: they may be together for years.\n\nAdults don't always get along with each other but the kind of move that you did, making this declaration like that? It's just childish and silly and I've never known adults to do that before and I know plenty of adults who don't particularly like each other. But these things don't need to be declared like that. It's just immature.\n\nThey tend to work themselves out: so for example in your situation she would let her boyfriend go to your parties and just have something else to do on that night. I've seen this a million times. No one made any silly declarations.", "ESH\n\ninsulting someone behind their back, for whatever reason, is always an asshole move. however, since you two had a chat to work out your differences, I don't see why you'd ban her for something she said BEFORE you actually had a discussion", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
