{"id": 5219, "submission_id": "zqsye0", "title": "AITA for banning my friend's SO from future parties?", "selftext": "I (mid-thirties man) have a good friend from college who had been dating a woman for a few years. She and I have had our differences in the past; for example, we got into an argument about Taylor Swift: she claimed that the only reason people don't like her is because they are sexist; I suggested that there may be other reasons people don't like her (e.g., she is overplayed). The argument ended in me being called sexist myself. (For the record, I actually like T-Swift.)\n\nThis past summer, I hosted a gathering of friend's at a relative's house upstate. I invited my friend and his SO to the gathering. I saw it as an opportunity to resolve our differences so I made an extra effort to make sure they felt comfortable (e.g., by reserving for them the best room in the house).\n\nThat evening we were all hanging out in the basement and I received a notification on my phone saying I had recently been in contact with someone who'd contracted the new global pathogen. I jokingly asked the group if anyone else had received these notifications, and mentioned I had received several of these over the past few days.\n\nEveryone else in the room said they hadn't received any notifications. Then my friend's SO said that she thought I was being very disrespectful by informing everyone of this fact in such a casual manner.\n\nI said that the likely reason I received the notifications was that I had been on a plane earlier that week, but that I had been wearing face protection so it wasn't a cause for concern. I also reminded her that I had insisted everyone be inoculated before attending the party and that I myself had taken a swab earlier that morning just to be extra cautious.\n\nShe continued to insist that I was being disrespectful, and things got awkward and the vibe in the room changed.\n\nLater, I approached her privately to try to clear the air. She repeatedly said that I needed to be \"taken to task\" for my behavior. I listened and eventually we clinked glasses and agreed to put the issue behind us.\n\nThen the next day, I found out from another friend of mine that, after our initial altercation (but before our private meeting) she had overheard this woman say to someone else that I was an \"asshole.\"\n\nIn my view, this crossed the line. It is one thing to call someone out for perceived inappropriate behavior; it is another to badmouth them behind their back at their own party. I don't want to surround myself with people who have such little respect for me.\n\nThe following day I sent my friend a text that said, \"I have some tough news to convey, which is that \\[name\\] is no longer welcome at parties I throw in the future. I'm happy to explain my reasoning in greater detail....Please know I love you like a brother and have no ill will toward you whatsoever.\"\n\nMy friend hasn't spoken to me since.\n\nI'm conflicted. On one hand, I think I am justified in closing my door to someone who clearly doesn't respect me. On the other hand, maybe I am overreacting.\n\nWhat do you think, Reddit?", "created_utc": 1671554215, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqsye0/aita_for_banning_my_friends_so_from_future_parties/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Actually, it sounds like she actively dislikes you and looks for reasons to continue doing so. I could be way off base saying that of course. \n\nYou set a polite and reasonable boundary here, imo. \n\nI find it sad that your good friend said nothing during the incident and continues to say nothing.  Unfortunately, when things like this happen we may lose or have to take a long break from someone we care about but if it means avoiding potentially toxic situations it is for the best.", "YTA  \n\n\nfor not taking the global situation serious but pretending like you are,  \n\n\nmultiple notifications over the past few days, and you decide, well everyone has the jab so they have higher chances of survival, so i can just not tell them.  \n\n\nand you are upset that you are being called out and rightly termed for rsking the health of all of your guests?", "NTA you can invite who you want to your parties, but consider two things:\n\n1. Your friend will likely not come to parties where his SO is not welcome.\n\n2. By your description the SO called you an AH before you clinked glasses and made up.", "Your parties your house, invite who you want etc.\n\nHowever, YTA for not telling people you were exposed to the virus and then hosting a house gathering. You need to inform people so that they can make their own judgements e.g. I was recently exposed to my boss (who was covid positive), i informed my fam christmas party that this happened, and didn't go. \n\nYa you are jabbed and you tested, but you have to let others make their choice, and you need to share information for them to do it. That's just the polite and considerate thing to do.", "NTA. I'm surprised you were even able to talk to her after she used the phrase \"take you to task.\" Like... who exactly does she think she is judging your absolutely normal comment as sexist?", "[removed]", "NTA. But what do you value more. Your friend or his ridiculous wife? \nI would also be really pissed but if you cut her out your are cutting him out.", "NTA\n\nYour parties, your guest lists.", "NTA - not sure how people are misconveying what happened here. You sent a text privately to your friend (?) that his SO is no longer welcome, after she very publicly made it clear she thinks you are sexist and an asshole. Your friend is silly if he doesn't see how that's kind of unacceptable behavior towards you.\n\nAlso, the Covid thing isn't even your fault. You said yourself you swabbed yourself that very morning and warned everyone to be vaccinated.", "NTA. Sounds to me like you\u2019ve made a real effort to at least have a civil relationship with your friend\u2019s SO.  But she seem like TA , starting with if you don\u2019t like Taylor Swift you\u2019re a sexist.  \n\nAt some point your mental health, and principles come first.", "NTA\n\nYou get to invite or exclude who you want. This person seems intolerable anyway.\n\nI would not have done this over text. I would have had a verbal conversationq", "NTA.\n\nYou aren't obligated to invite people you don't want to.", "NTA, but know that this action might have ended your friendship. Never EVER make anyone choose between u and another person, unless this person is an SA, murderer, or aggressive.\nThe probability is that who makes them choose will not be chosen", "NTA. \n\nI have been in a very similar situation the past couple of years, in that my best friend has been dating very seriously a girl who a first of all don\u2019t get along with, second of all, I just think my friend deserves much better than her. I have had several of these interactions that you\u2019re describing, where she objects to something I\u2019ve said that\u2019s ultimately harmless, but to her it\u2019s like a black and white issue that she must make known to me how wrong she thinks I am. Wont let me finish a sentence when I try to respond to her objection\u2026 Regardless of who someone like that is, like a coworker, or a mild acquaintance, it sucks to be around someone who is consistently confrontational or quarrelsome. Like I just don\u2019t jive with that. I\u2019m all for expressing your views, and standing up for what you believe in, I do the same thing and I\u2019m doing it literally right now as I write this comment, I guess I take issue with someone assuming the worst intentions possible behind something I\u2019ve said. And then not listening to any follow up conversation lol.\n\nUltimately, I just decided to just clink classes with this girl much like you did, to just accept that I don\u2019t like her but I *can* stand her, and if my friend loves her then I accept this person will be in my life. I have never overheard her talking shit behind my back, however. I think that is the point in your story where she is the asshole. There\u2019s no way to dress that up; disagreeing/arguing is one thing but talking shit/gossiping is malicious.", "ESH She's not wrong, you do sound like an AH. She does sound like she's trying to start shit, so that's why it's not y t a. But you are a huge AH for not telling people about the contact notification you got BEFORE hanging out. A negative test means shit.", "YTA\n\nShe called you an asshole. Big deal. I doubt that's the first time someone has said that.\n\nAnd do you KNOW what she said or the context she said it in? Nope. But then you make this grandiose statement to your friend about how she's not welcome in your life?\n\nDepending on where they're at in their relationship you may have just told him he's not welcome either.\n\nAll because someone told you they heard someone else call you an \"asshole\"\n\nIronically she was right: YTA", "I think you're being entierly too sensitive. She's your friends SO, so to cut her off means you will cut your friend off. What's he supposed to do pick you over the person who he picked to spend the rest of his life with?", "Yta for sure, yes. People will have opinions of you. Singling her out life that (no invite) is a bad move on your part: they may be together for years.\n\nAdults don't always get along with each other but the kind of move that you did, making this declaration like that? It's just childish and silly and I've never known adults to do that before and I know plenty of adults who don't particularly like each other. But these things don't need to be declared like that. It's just immature.\n\nThey tend to work themselves out: so for example in your situation she would let her boyfriend go to your parties and just have something else to do on that night. I've seen this a million times. No one made any silly declarations.", "ESH\n\ninsulting someone behind their back, for whatever reason, is always an asshole move. however, since you two had a chat to work out your differences, I don't see why you'd ban her for something she said BEFORE you actually had a discussion", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
