No one gets to call dibs on another person with anything other than an engagement ring.", "NTA - but would you rather keep your friend or date this guy?  Because you will have to choose, one relationship will most likely not survive this.  The choice is yours.", "NTA for liking him, imo you can't control that, but if you care about your friend, talk to her. If she asks you to not date him, you will have to make a choice, which relationship is more important, but at least you'll be honest and there will be no misunderstandings. If you're serious about the guy, tell her exactly that and if she's truly your friend, she should ultimately make her peace with the situation. Be prepared for awkward feelings.\n\nGood luck!"]}
