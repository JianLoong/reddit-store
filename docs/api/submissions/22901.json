I can handle the job fine as long as everyone does their job properly. \n\nWe have a bell that we use to tell each other when orders come in and once they're ready to go out. It's a loud bell and makes a clear sound that even I can hear finw throughout the building. Almost all the bartenders here use it just fine. But one of them has an issue with using it with me. She refuses to touch the bell and instead comes back and says, \"DING!\"  Often not even loudly enough for anyone to hear it, let alone me. If I'm in the kitchen, I can see her and I can hear ok if the person is only a few feet away and speaks clearly but I'm usually the only cook during my shift so I have to step out to run to coolers or to the basement. So if she's just making noises with her mouth, I'm not going to hear that. And then she gets mad every time this happens for \"not doing my job\" and costing her tips for food taking longer. \n    I've told her to knock it off. Probably every shift we've worked together over the past month. And I've been very direct about it; \"I can't hear that, ring the bell\". She straight up refuses to listen and now I've found out she has no problem with the bell with the other cooks. She uses it every time. So I'm positive she's just doing it to be a jerk about my disability (she's been mean about my other disabilities in the past too). \n    So I finally told her I'm not cooking anything for her unless the bell is rung, even if I'm in the kitchen and see her. She didn't belive me and came in 10 minutes later and says, \"DING!\" And I just kept working on making the soups for that night. She came in again a few minutes later and goes, \"I said DING!\" And I ignored her again. So she said it again and I still kept ignoring her. \n    After another minute of her waiting she starts just loudly, almost screaming, chanting, \"DING! DING! DING! DING! DING!\" It was honestly hilarious and all the customers can see into the kitchen from the bar and got to watch this. \n    Anyway after she did that for about 30 seconds and then she figured out what I was doing and turned and hit the bell. So I immediately stopped and made the order and sent it out. No complaints at all from anyone that it took a few extra minutes, customer even complimented their burger.\n    But she threw a fit over it to other coworkers saying that she looked \"stupid\" in front of the customers and that some of them were laughing about it (she probably looked even more ridiculous without any context) and some of them are saying that it was mean to do and that I should apologize but I don't feel bad at all.
