We lost our baby brother too. I was raised by my uncle and my sisters by my grandparents, and my dad was in a mental health institute after losing Mom. It turns out he's been controlling my school life since I was in elementary.\n\nI (M27) had a hard upbringing and have trust issues. I love my life and all of its glory, but I just found out that my dad was sending notes in to teachers claiming that I was special needs, had self-esteem issues, autism, et cetera, so they should lay it easy on me. The teachers must have told other students that, because for some reason I was treated differently my whole school life until high school.\n\nI had less homework, the girls would sit next to me and buy me snacks, and I got to have extra time on tests and stuff. I just thought that the teachers liked me, and when I tried to tell my dad that, he'd just tell me that I was a lovely young man and deserved extra attention. I then became more and more shy, weirdly, as I was embarrassed and started to think something was wrong with me. Teachers talked to me softly, I got \"special\" extracurricular classes, and I had shorted school days.\n\nTo most, this sounds fun, but it was horrible. I was falling behind and my only friend was the only other \"Special\" kid. I didn't start dating until high school when it finally stopped. I brought this up to my dad recently, as he's moving away with his new gf, and he broke and told me how he set up an easy way for me. It was a shocker how I even got into college with this \"easy way\" of elementary and middle school!\n\nI yelled at him something along the lines of \"You knew I was normal! That ruined my childhood! I wasn't average at all, no, I was the 'special kid' who had to eat lunch with the teachers!\" and just yelled for like 5 minutes. I feel really bad about it now, because he just stood up and drove away. I still have no idea how he got away with it. I feel bad, and know that he was just trying to give me an easy home run, but he was raised normally and he's fine (mostly...)\n\nSo, Redditors of Reddit, AITA for yelling at my dad and breaking his heart after he tried to make me have an easy way around school (and disrespected actual special needs kids?)\n\nEdit - my sisters did not receive this treatment, they were in a boarding school in Colorado after being expelled in elementary for pranks that went too far.", "created_utc": 1690388864, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15aag3z/aita_for_yelling_at_my_dad_after_finding_out_how/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your dad was manipulating you and everyone around you by telling lies. He was wrong to do that. It was abusive. He is the AH.", "NTA \n\nHe did you wrong and kept it a secret all these years. He has to reconcile that and the damage he caused and it's going to take awhile. Do not contact him yet. \n\nPlease see a therapist who can help you work this out. It's going to take time to adjust. Anger was actually a good first step. Now you can think about it a little more rationally, hopefully coming to terms with it and maybe forgiving him down the road later on. Not to his face forgive him, just in your own mind so you can move on. It's not healthy to carry all that baggage around for the rest of your life because it's like letting him still have that power over you. \n\nI wish you only the best in your recovery from such a traumatic childhood experience and the shocking revelation.", "NTA \n\nIs there any chance your dad had Munchausen by proxy? If he spent time in a mental institution, I can't help but wonder that. \n\nAlso, how in the world did you qualify for services to begin with? So many parents struggle to get their kids help that they actually need, I'm shocked the school just went with it.", "NTA You're Dad was setting you up for failure, as your father he should have been encouraging you to challenge yourself, not holding you back", "You\u2019re nta. That\u2019s a lot to process and work through in a very short amount of time. It\u2019s understandable to be upset about it because it effected you through your entire school life and beyond. I think the best thing to do is apologize for yelling but still communicate how that hurt your self esteem and was a significantly wrong choice. Take some time to think through how you feel and how you want to approach the situation and work from there.", "NTA. That's practically Munchausen by proxy, but also, why did the teachers blindly believe him? Usually, to receive services you need a mountain of documentation. I would have done some yelling as well.", "hmm, so the teachers just believed handwritten notes from your dad? And your mother knew nothing about this?  Wasn't brought up during PTA meetings?", "NTA\n\nI'd have done more than shout. I'd have disowned him, and told him that I never want to see him again.", "NTA. I get that he thought he was helping, and that he's hurt that it turns out his \"help\" was in actuality harm, but that doesn't mean he shouldn't have to hear from you about it or face it. It was your life, it was your reality, and it was horrible for you -- you're allowed to own that. I hope he can take some time to process and reflect on his actions and come to you with an apology for the way things went, though it will never take that experience away. And he may not. You will have to decide how YOU feel, and what YOU need, and how you want to handle this and your relationship with your father going forward. I'm sorry for all that you went through, but am glad you are otherwise happy with your life now. I hope you can make peace with this new addition to your history after allowing yourself to feel all the feelings you have about them.", "NTA, this is a massive overstep and abuse of the school system/his role as a parent. It's understandable that he would want to help you. But his version of \"help\" was setting you up for failure. The job of a parent is to prepare their child to succeed and find happiness once they reach adulthood. \"Special needs\" is designed for people who may not be able to achieve as much. He deliberately held you back from reaching your full potential as a student and adult man. You were deprived of experiences that are formative for children. These are serious offenses. \n\nWhether or not he meant to, he did cause you a great deal of harm. He should come to recognize that and you are completely entitled to your negative feelings.", "I'm gonna go with NTA if you didn't enjoy being treated like a special needs child then that would be a bad memory. You haven't mentioned that he wrote letters for your sisters so I'm gonna assume he didn't and it was only you who didn't get to feel like a normal child.\n\nI think it's ok to be upset about what he did to you, especially if you aren't a special needs child. There's also the fact that he lied about it when you asked him as a kid.\n\nI think he left you because in his mind he didn't do anything wrong and even if he did he's ready to start his life over with new gf and might not feel like apologizing for something that deeply effected you.\n\nDon't be surprised if he never apologizes.", "NTA. What's the mental diagnosis on the dad, OP? Because whatever it is, it sounds like he has Narcissist Personality Disorder on top of it. My mom has NPD and my entire childhood she used my minor learning disability to get attention about how she was such a good, long-suffering mom. She blew my ADHD out of proportion and pulled me out of the honors classes my dad put me in and got me put in special ed. When I acted out because of the instability and boredom, that was just more arrows in her quiver of \"omg, look at me, I'm such a good long-suffering mom for parenting such a broken special needs child.\" She did this, by the way, while *horribly* neglecting me and my brother. Either me or my grandmother had to cook dinner most nights while she watched TV or had a depressive episode and went to bed early. We lived in poverty because she squandered every bit of child support and alimony on herself. My grandmother just enabled her and wound up paying the mortgage. This culminated in her actually losing the house while I was paying her rent while in college and my grandmother buying her a new place while I was functionally homeless, because the new place was too small.\n\nIf you can't tell, I'm bitter about it. My entire life she neglected me and used me for attention. It sounds like your dad is the same. I'm too much of a coward to confront her, so I just don't talk to her at all.\n\nWhatever you said to your dad, he deserved it and so much more. I'm sorry he was like that to you. I'm sorry his mental illness and need for attention came before your needs as a child.", "NTA. He was crazy and projected maybe. But it was very wrong for a bazillion reasons anyway. \n\nSeek a therapist. This is a big one.", "As a teacher myself, it\u2019s clear as day to us which kids have special needs. Can spot the autistic, ADHD, and neurotypical kids almost instantly. \n\nBased on what you\u2019ve said, I really struggle to believe you were neurotypical. I think you are neurodivergent, and your father thought he was doing what was right for you, but when he saw how you perceived that all as a negative that\u2019s when he broke down and admitted that he was trying to lower the standards for you (which would offend anyone, obviously). \n\nYour father clearly loves you. I think your anger and hurt stem from the fact that you are indeed neurodivergent and \u201cdifferent\u201d, but you don\u2019t want to be, so you want to blame your dad for \u201cspreading a lie\u201d.\n\nNothing wrong with being neurodivergent. Neurodivergent people have strengths that neurotypicals do not (as well as weaknesses, obviously). Neurodivergents think in a more \u201coriginal\u201d way, which is why the rigid structure of a classroom environment doesn\u2019t benefit them as much.", "I'm gonna say ESH. Before you downvote me:\n\n- Your mom and baby brother's loss was a horrific experience, and I'm sorry you had to go through it.\n\n- Everyone in your family experienced the loss and grieved in their own way (including your dad. Did he go into mental care after that? I think anyone would be devastated and within their right to seek help.) \n\n- I'm not a parent, but I have two of them that drove me crazy while they raised me, and I too blame them for a lot of FK ups in my upbringing. HOWEVER, through therapy, I was able to comprehend that most parents have zero idea of what they're doing when it comes to raising children. Even those who have raised 3+ children are lying if they told you they know what they're doing. Most parents know their obligations and love and have a basic knowledge of how to somewhat navigate through life. \n\nSooo maybe your dad was trying to make things easier on you after having gone through all that. Maybe he thought it was the best for you, CLEARLY it wasn't. \n\nMy question is: Do you honestly think he purposely did it with the intent to make you go through this? If so, you shouldn't be asking if YTA, you'd be within your tight to do so. If not, I think you have your answer. \n\nYour dad sucks for having done that, you suck for yelling at him and the whole thing sucks because it could have been avoided or stopped at some point, absolutely. Sorry you had to go through all that and find out like that. \n\nOut of curiosity, did any of your siblings also get special treatment?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He was over-the-top, and we (me and my uncle) think that it's Munchausen by proxy that caused him to act like this. I appreciate your sympathy for him, but I really dislike the fact that my golden years were not truly how a little boy should be raised.", "I get where you're coming from, kind of, but OP is allowed to have whatever reaction he had when this information was dropped out of the blue. As someone who went through some traumatic times in which I feel I was failed by my parents to some degree, and while I totally understand that the way it was was because things were terrible for everyone all around for various reasons at that time, but I was and am still allowed in retrospect to feel bad for that little girl who got lost in the shuffle and still suffers / has to work through the ramifications of those experiences. I was able to ask for an apology for that in recent years, albeit in a calmer time and after processing everything, and received it.\n\nSo, yes, OP can understand that everyone in his family was suffering a tragic loss and were all just doing the best they could, and that his father didn't do what he did out of malice, but it *still* hurt him and didn't serve in his actual best interests -- it caused harm.
