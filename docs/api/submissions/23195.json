We lost our baby brother too. I was raised by my uncle and my sisters by my grandparents, and my dad was in a mental health institute after losing Mom. It turns out he's been controlling my school life since I was in elementary.\n\nI (M27) had a hard upbringing and have trust issues. I love my life and all of its glory, but I just found out that my dad was sending notes in to teachers claiming that I was special needs, had self-esteem issues, autism, et cetera, so they should lay it easy on me. The teachers must have told other students that, because for some reason I was treated differently my whole school life until high school.\n\nI had less homework, the girls would sit next to me and buy me snacks, and I got to have extra time on tests and stuff. I just thought that the teachers liked me, and when I tried to tell my dad that, he'd just tell me that I was a lovely young man and deserved extra attention. I then became more and more shy, weirdly, as I was embarrassed and started to think something was wrong with me. Teachers talked to me softly, I got \"special\" extracurricular classes, and I had shorted school days.\n\nTo most, this sounds fun, but it was horrible. I was falling behind and my only friend was the only other \"Special\" kid. I didn't start dating until high school when it finally stopped. I brought this up to my dad recently, as he's moving away with his new gf, and he broke and told me how he set up an easy way for me. It was a shocker how I even got into college with this \"easy way\" of elementary and middle school!\n\nI yelled at him something along the lines of \"You knew I was normal! That ruined my childhood! I wasn't average at all, no, I was the 'special kid' who had to eat lunch with the teachers!\" and just yelled for like 5 minutes. I feel really bad about it now, because he just stood up and drove away. I still have no idea how he got away with it. I feel bad, and know that he was just trying to give me an easy home run, but he was raised normally and he's fine (mostly...)\n\nSo, Redditors of Reddit, AITA for yelling at my dad and breaking his heart after he tried to make me have an easy way around school (and disrespected actual special needs kids?)\n\nEdit - my sisters did not receive this treatment, they were in a boarding school in Colorado after being expelled in elementary for pranks that went too far.", "created_utc": 1690388864, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15aag3z/aita_for_yelling_at_my_dad_after_finding_out_how/", "score": 749, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your dad was manipulating you and everyone around you by telling lies. He was wrong to do that. It was abusive. He is the AH.", "NTA \n\nHe did you wrong and kept it a secret all these years. He has to reconcile that and the damage he caused and it's going to take awhile. Do not contact him yet. \n\nPlease see a therapist who can help you work this out. It's going to take time to adjust. Anger was actually a good first step. Now you can think about it a little more rationally, hopefully coming to terms with it and maybe forgiving him down the road later on. Not to his face forgive him, just in your own mind so you can move on. It's not healthy to carry all that baggage around for the rest of your life because it's like letting him still have that power over you. \n\nI wish you only the best in your recovery from such a traumatic childhood experience and the shocking revelation.", "NTA \n\nIs there any chance your dad had Munchausen by proxy? If he spent time in a mental institution, I can't help but wonder that. \n\nAlso, how in the world did you qualify for services to begin with? So many parents struggle to get their kids help that they actually need, I'm shocked the school just went with it.", "NTA You're Dad was setting you up for failure, as your father he should have been encouraging you to challenge yourself, not holding you back", "You\u2019re nta. That\u2019s a lot to process and work through in a very short amount of time. It\u2019s understandable to be upset about it because it effected you through your entire school life and beyond. I think the best thing to do is apologize for yelling but still communicate how that hurt your self esteem and was a significantly wrong choice. Take some time to think through how you feel and how you want to approach the situation and work from there.", "NTA. That's practically Munchausen by proxy, but also, why did the teachers blindly believe him? Usually, to receive services you need a mountain of documentation. I would have done some yelling as well.", "hmm, so the teachers just believed handwritten notes from your dad? And your mother knew nothing about this?  Wasn't brought up during PTA meetings?", "NTA\n\nI'd have done more than shout. I'd have disowned him, and told him that I never want to see him again.", "NTA. I get that he thought he was helping, and that he's hurt that it turns out his \"help\" was in actuality harm, but that doesn't mean he shouldn't have to hear from you about it or face it. It was your life, it was your reality, and it was horrible for you -- you're allowed to own that. I hope he can take some time to process and reflect on his actions and come to you with an apology for the way things went, though it will never take that experience away. And he may not. You will have to decide how YOU feel, and what YOU need, and how you want to handle this and your relationship with your father going forward. I'm sorry for all that you went through, but am glad you are otherwise happy with your life now. I hope you can make peace with this new addition to your history after allowing yourself to feel all the feelings you have about them.", "NTA, this is a massive overstep and abuse of the school system/his role as a parent. It's understandable that he would want to help you. But his version of \"help\" was setting you up for failure. The job of a parent is to prepare their child to succeed and find happiness once they reach adulthood. \"Special needs\" is designed for people who may not be able to achieve as much. He deliberately held you back from reaching your full potential as a student and adult man. You were deprived of experiences that are formative for children. These are serious offenses. \n\nWhether or not he meant to, he did cause you a great deal of harm. He should come to recognize that and you are completely entitled to your negative feelings.", "I'm gonna go with NTA if you didn't enjoy being treated like a special needs child then that would be a bad memory. You haven't mentioned that he wrote letters for your sisters so I'm gonna assume he didn't and it was only you who didn't get to feel like a normal child.\n\nI think it's ok to be upset about what he did to you, especially if you aren't a special needs child. There's also the fact that he lied about it when you asked him as a kid.\n\nI think he left you because in his mind he didn't do anything wrong and even if he did he's ready to start his life over with new gf and might not feel like apologizing for something that deeply effected you.\n\nDon't be surprised if he never apologizes.", "NTA. What's the mental diagnosis on the dad, OP? Because whatever it is, it sounds like he has Narcissist Personality Disorder on top of it. My mom has NPD and my entire childhood she used my minor learning disability to get attention about how she was such a good, long-suffering mom. She blew my ADHD out of proportion and pulled me out of the honors classes my dad put me in and got me put in special ed. When I acted out because of the instability and boredom, that was just more arrows in her quiver of \"omg, look at me, I'm such a good long-suffering mom for parenting such a broken special needs child.\" She did this, by the way, while *horribly* neglecting me and my brother. Either me or my grandmother had to cook dinner most nights while she watched TV or had a depressive episode and went to bed early. We lived in poverty because she squandered every bit of child support and alimony on herself. My grandmother just enabled her and wound up paying the mortgage. This culminated in her actually losing the house while I was paying her rent while in college and my grandmother buying her a new place while I was functionally homeless, because the new place was too small.\n\nIf you can't tell, I'm bitter about it. My entire life she neglected me and used me for attention. It sounds like your dad is the same. I'm too much of a coward to confront her, so I just don't talk to her at all.\n\nWhatever you said to your dad, he deserved it and so much more. I'm sorry he was like that to you. I'm sorry his mental illness and need for attention came before your needs as a child.", "NTA. He was crazy and projected maybe. But it was very wrong for a bazillion reasons anyway. \n\nSeek a therapist. This is a big one.", "As a teacher myself, it\u2019s clear as day to us which kids have special needs. Can spot the autistic, ADHD, and neurotypical kids almost instantly. \n\nBased on what you\u2019ve said, I really struggle to believe you were neurotypical. I think you are neurodivergent, and your father thought he was doing what was right for you, but when he saw how you perceived that all as a negative that\u2019s when he broke down and admitted that he was trying to lower the standards for you (which would offend anyone, obviously). \n\nYour father clearly loves you. I think your anger and hurt stem from the fact that you are indeed neurodivergent and \u201cdifferent\u201d, but you don\u2019t want to be, so you want to blame your dad for \u201cspreading a lie\u201d.\n\nNothing wrong with being neurodivergent. Neurodivergent people have strengths that neurotypicals do not (as well as weaknesses, obviously). Neurodivergents think in a more \u201coriginal\u201d way, which is why the rigid structure of a classroom environment doesn\u2019t benefit them as much.", "I'm gonna say ESH. Before you downvote me:\n\n- Your mom and baby brother's loss was a horrific experience, and I'm sorry you had to go through it.\n\n- Everyone in your family experienced the loss and grieved in their own way (including your dad. Did he go into mental care after that? I think anyone would be devastated and within their right to seek help.) \n\n- I'm not a parent, but I have two of them that drove me crazy while they raised me, and I too blame them for a lot of FK ups in my upbringing. HOWEVER, through therapy, I was able to comprehend that most parents have zero idea of what they're doing when it comes to raising children. Even those who have raised 3+ children are lying if they told you they know what they're doing. Most parents know their obligations and love and have a basic knowledge of how to somewhat navigate through life. \n\nSooo maybe your dad was trying to make things easier on you after having gone through all that. Maybe he thought it was the best for you, CLEARLY it wasn't. \n\nMy question is: Do you honestly think he purposely did it with the intent to make you go through this? If so, you shouldn't be asking if YTA, you'd be within your tight to do so. If not, I think you have your answer. \n\nYour dad sucks for having done that, you suck for yelling at him and the whole thing sucks because it could have been avoided or stopped at some point, absolutely. Sorry you had to go through all that and find out like that. \n\nOut of curiosity, did any of your siblings also get special treatment?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your dad sent in notes claiming you had special needs and were autistic - and the school just respected that, even without any sort of official documentation?\n\nWhere the heck did you grow up?

Cut.  Him.  Off.\n\nWhat he did was cheat you out of a potentially better hand in life.  You learned your dad basically made up that you were \"special\".  First, he persuaded your teachers of that.  Somehow, it filtered to your peers, who pitied or resented you.  You basically got Charlie Gordon'd (Read \"Flowers for Algernon\").  What he did affected you academically and socially, and you very likely lost a few opportunities.  Whether to hang out and make friends or to show off your true potential in school, he ruined all of that for you for YEARS.  And unfortunately, unless he has a time machine, he's never going to make that right, and you will never get that time back.  Leave him in the dust.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Are you saying that ALL your teachers just took your dad at his word, with literally no official documentation?", "You would be amazed at the number of students receiving services that don't really need them because dealing with their parents is more of a pain in the ass than just doing what they want.

You know that, right? You need to have the paperwork showing a need for accommodations.", "He was probably designated as a resource student in special ed.  Lots of resource students aren't in self contained classrooms but still get special accommodations, or he could have had a 504.  I have also had students who didn't even realize they were in a special ed class.  A shortened school day is a relatively normal IEP accommodation as well.", "Yeah, I'm aware, but even I don't know half the \"things\" he said I had!

It may well be that it's been too long and the decision is out of your hands. \n\nIf you're financially able to, you can consider seeing your current therapist for the kinds of issues you're already working on with her and one specializing in this kind of psychological abuse. It's expensive, but it might be a good option at least for a few sessions till you're really comfortable with the new therapist. I did this for quite a while. I was already seeing one therapist for general life with disability issues when I learned about a specific treatment for my chronic pain. I was happy with my original therapist but learned about this particular treatment which she thought could help but wasn't comfortable providing without any experience in it. After a while when I was comfortable with the new pain psychologist, I sort of naturally began to bring all of my concerns to him and stopped seeing my original therapist. I don't know if that's possible for you, but I thought I'd suggest it. \n\nNo matter what you end up doing, I hope you're able to get through all of this. Maybe, if you ever felt comfortable, you could try improving your education. There are many adult education options, online and probably in-person near you.

Not sure what state you reside in, but you might want to consider speaking with a family law lawyer and find out what your options are. This needs to stop. You don't need to be in a constant state of being on edge because you don't know what he is going to pull next. You need to talk to someone about this and a lawyer might be a good place to start.

I think you don't have a clear idea of the situation. From a special education standpoint a note from your father would not be enough to get services. \n\nYou said that the \"notes\" claimed you had self-esteem issues and autism and in the comments you said that you have ADHD. Autism and ADHD can be comorbid meaning that if a child has one, it's not uncommon for them to also have the other. Reduced homework and extra time of tests are pretty standard accommodations for a child with ADHD. The \"special\" extracurriculars were probably special ed services as dictated by an IEP, maybe speech therapy or something for social skills. The girls that sat near you probably wanted to be friends, but if you really do have autism you might not have picked up on the social cues. Additionally, not dating until high school is pretty typical behavior, so I don't know why you seem to see this as an issue. I have no idea about the shortened days though.\n\nNow on to why this finally stopped in high school. There are two possibilities. \n\n1) Your mother passed away when you were 14 and you went to live with relatives and started a new school. If you relatives were not aware that you had an IEP/504 then they wouldn't know to mention it to the new school.\n\n2) You might have outgrown it. It's not uncommon for students who receive proper support , medication, and services throughout elementary and middle school to learn coping strategies so the support is no longer needed. Elementary and middle school students are not typically involved in IEP meetings, so unless your parents told you, you had no way of knowing that you had an IEP. \n\nLook I'm not saying that it was right to never tell you until now, but there can be other explanations besides your father controlling your life. By middle school I would hope that students know about their disabilities, but its ultimately up to the parents to tell them.

You should seriously consider sueing the crap out of them.", "OP has mentioned having ADHD elsewhere, and that they saw multiple doctors who prescribed them medications as a kid. \n\nHe also talked about reaching out to his elementary school teachers to get permission to share this story.

What your dad did is downright despicable. I had something of the opposite problem in school; I blew up a bunch of tests when I was in middle school, and the guidance counselor got it into their heads that I should be in gifted classes. Which, yeah, I probably should have. The problem was that there were ZERO options for transitioning a student into gifted classes in middle school. I got jumped from reading Heinlein juveniles (Which WERE **WAAY** beyond the average reading level for 6th grade in my school) straight to high-school-level literature classes with no in-between. And jumped from halfway thru algebra I to halfway through algebra II. Of course I couldn't handle the jump, and I flopped, flunking 6th grade, which, because there was no recognition of the ridiculous task I'd been set in jumping an entire year in a couple months, meant that the MORONS in administration decided I needed to be held back! When I was already having problems fitting into the school. Which meant I was getting picked on and bullied, which smashed my ability to deal with what was being done to me academically, where I was suddenly dumped from being expected to jump a full year ahead to being held a year BEHIND my actual grade level. So OF COURSE I wasn't going to do that work, because I already fucking KNEW all this garbage. So I almost got held back a SECOND year, got into all kinds of fights that I NEVER started, and the admins decided that, instead of dealing with the massive crop of juvenile delinquents that were flooding the disciplinary process of the schools and bullying me, they'd just drop ME into a severe-behavior LD class for the rest of my school career, which, if I didn't comply 100% with their remedial classes and calendar-based disciplinary system, would cause me to graduate with an LD diploma AT BEST.", "What your dad did is disturbing on so many levels.

You're probably right that he might very well have munchausen by proxy, which would explain the unnecessary surgery you were put through, mentioned in one of your replies (just along with everything else, but THAT especially).\n\nAgain, I'm sorry it's been a struggle with him, but I hope you're able to continue to move forward despite everything, and I'd hope that he could get the help that he clearly needs.", ">  I wish you all the best for recovering for such atrocious treatment.
