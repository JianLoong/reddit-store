Since my 16-year-old son J\u00e9an  has been staying home due to a sprained ankle, I let him babysit his younger brothers (7M, 5M, and 3M) while I was gone. He's done it before and usually enjoys it, and I rarely ever let him babysit for more than a few hours so I'm not \u201cparentifying\u201d him before you guys come at me in the comments. This was an unusual and unexpected circumstance, it would never be this long if I'd been able to plan beforehand.\n\nI checked in every day with J\u00e9an to make sure things were going well, and he always assured me things were fine. But when I called him a couple of hours before I was due to be home, he didn't answer. I texted him as well but no response. I was a bit worried, but since I'd called him earlier that day and things seemed fine, I assumed maybe he'd put the younger kids down for a nap and had his phone on silencer or something.\n\nBut when I got in, the first thing I noticed is that the front door was unlocked, and no one's downstairs. I almost go full panic mode but when I get upstairs I find all of my sons are in J\u00e9an's bedroom, he's fallen asleep and the younger kids are just running around playing with his things. I wake him up and ask him why the front door's unlocked. He explained they were getting too rowdy in the house so he was playing catch with them in the backyard, and he must've forgotten to lock the door when they came back in because he was chasing them around trying to keep them from throwing the ball at the windows. I asked him why he didn't at least check before going to sleep, and he said he'd meant to just sit down for a few minutes and fell asleep on accident.\n\nI was a bit skeptical because my youngest kids usually are really well-behaved, but regardless I told him keeping the front door unlocked is basic security and he should have checked at least once before going upstairs, so I'm grounding him for three days. He was pissed off and said I was overreacting, and that he \u201ccan't do anything right\u201d in my book. That's not true, I'm just particularly picky when it comes to my kids' safety, like any parent.\n\nAITA for grounding him? I know he needs some type of punishment but I can still see where grounding might've been too extreme.", "created_utc": 1691835716, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15p0ysz/aita_for_grounding_my_son_because_he_left_the/", "score": 308, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your injured 16 year-old son shouldn't be left alone for multiple days with three small children. Small wonder he's exhausted! \n\nAnd have you even checked how his ankle is doing? Because honestly, if it's bad enough that he's been staying home, then it's too bad for him to be running round after little kids.\n\nI get that this wasn't planned, but you should have had plenty of downtime in between looking after your mom, to organise a friend/family member who would check in with your kids at least once a day and do some cooking/cleaning/shopping/childcare to give J\u00e9an some rest time to himself. And that's bare minimum. Ideally, you'd find an adult that both you and J\u00e9an get on with, who could stay overnight while you're absent.\n\nAlso? There is no indication that J\u00e9an was neglectful. If he were making a habit out of leaving the door unlocked, then fine, punish him. But this isn't a bad habit; it's a one-off mistake due to exhaustion. And why is he that exhausted? Because he's been doing your job. He shouldn't be punished for that. You owe him some fucking gratitude for going above and beyond while you weren't there.\n\nIf he were my kid, I'd be lining up a meal out, or a cinema trip, or a day out with friends, to show how much I appreciated his long days of hard work.", "You left your injured son alone with your kids for\n\n>It was only 3 1/2 days.\n\nOnly?

In another comment you say it was \u2018only 3 1/2 days\u2019, that correct? The kid is 16. You left him to parent children. You don\u2019t get to be angry he made one mistake while doing an adult\u2019s job all week. \n\nHe does not need punishment here. He needs understanding and help. Can\u2019t expect a 16 year old to do an adult\u2019s job perfectly and then get pissed off cos they didn\u2019t do the adult\u2019s job perfectly. \n\nYou should apologize to him for losing your shit, empathize with him for how fucking tired an INJURED kid must be looking after THREE young children.

The discussion should have been enough. \n\nIf he spills something does he need punishment? If he forgets to make his bed does he need punishment? \n\nPunishment should be enforced when someone purposely does something wrong. If he stole something. If he slapped one of the siblings. If he cursed at you or refused to listen to you; yes, grounding him makes sense in these situations.\n\nBut mistakes? You don't punish someone for a mistake. You talk it out, explain, have them understand why it's important. First time mistake; talk it out. If he made the mistake again, that's different. The same mistake repeated shows he's not listening, not taking it seriously, etc etc. Then you could take some privileges away or something. But the first time mistake?

Since my 16-year-old son J\u00e9an  has been staying home due to a sprained ankle, I let him babysit his younger brothers (7M, 5M, and 3M) while I was gone. He's done it before and usually enjoys it, and I rarely ever let him babysit for more than a few hours so I'm not \u201cparentifying\u201d him before you guys come at me in the comments. This was an unusual and unexpected circumstance, it would never be this long if I'd been able to plan beforehand.\n\nI checked in every day with J\u00e9an to make sure things were going well, and he always assured me things were fine. But when I called him a couple of hours before I was due to be home, he didn't answer. I texted him as well but no response. I was a bit worried, but since I'd called him earlier that day and things seemed fine, I assumed maybe he'd put the younger kids down for a nap and had his phone on silencer or something.\n\nBut when I got in, the first thing I noticed is that the front door was unlocked, and no one's downstairs. I almost go full panic mode but when I get upstairs I find all of my sons are in J\u00e9an's bedroom, he's fallen asleep and the younger kids are just running around playing with his things. I wake him up and ask him why the front door's unlocked. He explained they were getting too rowdy in the house so he was playing catch with them in the backyard, and he must've forgotten to lock the door when they came back in because he was chasing them around trying to keep them from throwing the ball at the windows. I asked him why he didn't at least check before going to sleep, and he said he'd meant to just sit down for a few minutes and fell asleep on accident.\n\nI was a bit skeptical because my youngest kids usually are really well-behaved, but regardless I told him keeping the front door unlocked is basic security and he should have checked at least once before going upstairs, so I'm grounding him for three days. He was pissed off and said I was overreacting, and that he \u201ccan't do anything right\u201d in my book. That's not true, I'm just particularly picky when it comes to my kids' safety, like any parent.\n\nAITA for grounding him? I know he needs some type of punishment but I can still see where grounding might've been too extreme.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
