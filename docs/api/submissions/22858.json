Being the oldest meant I had to care for the other 3, which I still do for my brother (m17) since my mom is currently in another country.

My sister (f20) recently got a job and she has a daughter (f1), the daycare is only weekdays and my sister is working on a Saturday. She asked me in the middle of the night if I could babysit in a couple of hours (which would be the morning), that nobody else was able to and I have a free day. I refused since she knows my standing when it comes to kids, and frankly my niece is a bit of a troublemaker. Not to mention I\u2019m currently broke and probably won\u2019t have anything to feed her. As soon as I said no, she started saying how selfish I was being and how she already knew I was going to say no because I don\u2019t help out, then she hung up on me. AITA?

I have an older sister who had her first kid when i was 19, didn\u2019t change anything in her life to accommodate  the baby but I was expected to . For two years I was literally mom, I worked at 5am after work pick up baby from daycare then take care of him til she got home at maybe 12am. Then she gets pregnant again taking advantage of my generosity and availability so she thought I\u2019d be excited , I was not. In that time I grew a back  bone and switched jobs so that my hours were all over because I refused to take care of another child that i did not birth. My sister was not happy and quit her job leaving all the bills (that she hadn\u2019t paid in months come to find out) to me. For years I worked more than one job to keep up until I got the opportunity to move. When I moved I went no contact with my sister and low contact with my mom. Til this day my sister still doesn\u2019t and can\u2019t get a job. She ruined her life trying to ruin mine.  Your sister will call you selfish all day long and maybe she\u2019ll use the phrase \u201cit takes a village \u201c but remember it takes a village if the villagers WANT to help. Dig your heels in and be firm and don\u2019t let anyone tell you that you\u2019re being a bad sister or a terrible aunt.

I have noticed that many children grow up thinking that their children will be taken care of by the family unit because that is how they were raised. They had grandparents/aunts/uncles have a hand in raising them and expect their kid will have the same.
