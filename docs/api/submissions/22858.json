There's a reason you have to \"babyproof\" a house, it's because babies are troublemakers.\n\nIf OPs house is not \"babyproofed\" and they've got things that can be broken and destroyed within baby reach then the baby WILL cause trouble. One year old is old enough to crawl, which is old enough to get into things. Heck, a lot of babies start trying to walk at that stage, which involves pulling on things to stand themselves up. They also may understand how to open cupboards (where there may be tasty tasty cleaning chemicals.) It's not like OP can just put the baby in the empty bathtub all day to keep it out of trouble, because at that age it WILL get into trouble.\n\nSaying \"I/my house are/is not equipped to handle the kind of troublemaking babies do\" is not blaming the baby for being a baby, it's aknowledging that babies are babies, and they're trouble. (I say this as someone who's mum LOVES babies and would befriend people and become auntie to their babies, and who would babysit babies. They're TROUBLE every last one of them. Little bundles of chaos that will get into things the second you're distracted, especially when they're just learning to crawl/walk.

That\u2019s like your third time. Too much.", "The point being OP just needs to be clear with their boundaries instead of hiding behind and blaming a baby.  What\u2019s wrong with encouraging autonomy?", "They *were* very, very clear with their boundaries. That comes off as loud and clear - \u201cI refused\u201d , \u201cI\u2019ve made it very clear\u201d, \u201cI said no\u201d.", "Have you ever talked to someone with a new puppy or kitten? I know I called my cat a \"troublemaker\" when he was just a baby kitten figuring things out. Because he caused problems, because that's what kittens do. I know plenty of people who call babies \"troublemakers\" and absolutely adore their kids, because once again babies make messes and make things difficult. Pulling all the Tupperware out of the cupboard (standard baby behaviour, and I know some parents who are okay with it/don't have child locks on that particular door because that cupboard is safe for baby to open and baby won't hurt themselves flinging around Tupperware and lids) is causing TROUBLE. It's not malicious, necessarily a problem, or even a big deal, but it's still trouble. \n\nI mean hell, trouble is defined as 1) difficulty or problems 2)<public> unrest or disorder. Baby causing disorder by making a mess? Trouble. Not evil or malicious or being un baby like, but still trouble.", "NTA I have the same boundary. If you make an exception this time then she will be calling for you to eat her her over and over.\n\nYou have given up much of your life to care for kids that are not yours.

Stick to your boundaries.", "NTA. But your sister is. What an entitled, asshole thing to say to you. You\u2019re not selfish. You need a break. Hugs to you. \n\nMaybe she should\u2019ve thought better before getting knocked up. Her kid is not your responsibility. So now instead of passing off her kid like your mother did to her kids, she\u2019s going to have to learn how to be a parent.", "NTA and good grief! Even if you did like kids and were willing to babysit, she gave you a few hours notice in the middle of the night! What would she have done of you were out of town?\n \nYou did not have kids, just because you are blood related does not mean you have to be a freaking babysitter! Yes,things can happen and you need an emergency back up sitter. But your sister went about it all wrong.", "Babies are troublemakers tho? And this is from someone who's babysat plenty of them. At one they're just learning so many things, like walking, and they're curious. They cause trouble. It's not intentional, or malicious, but 100% of babies are troublemakers because they don't understand rules, like grabbing things and putting things in their mouths, and taking care of them in an un-babyproofed space is basically going from one baby-related mess/chaotic scenario to another.", "Yup...none of her business, sister needs to find someone else.", "Doesn't really matter.", "My younger son thought irritating his big brother was the funniest thing in the world. When he was 9 months his favorite game was knocking the remote control train off the tracks whenever it went past him. He still thinks watching his brother get frustrated is the funniest thing in the world. Some people are just born troublemakers.", "I feel like there is a disagreement here as to what qualifies as a \"troublemakers\" because I'm with OP on this. I call kittens and puppies troublemakers for doing kitten/puppy things, and I may call a baby a \"little troublemaker\" for doing general baby things like making a mess or whatever. Not because they're being a massive burden or are awful or anything, but because they're doing something that's causing a little bit of \"trouble\" (or chaos) \nOnce they can move they can cause trouble, and troublemaker sounds nicer than what I use for kittens (chaos gremlins the lot of them.

She has already said no.", "NTA. Your sister chose to have a kid, so let her stay home from work and look after it.", "Totally agree with you.", "NAH she sounds desperate for help and frustrated. I doubt you were the first one she called, since this has been hanging over her head all week.", "Definitely NTA.\n\nIf somebody wakes me in the middle of the night it had better because the apartment is on fire or something similarly dire.  A demand to babysit a kid won't get anything but a \"F@ck you!\"\n\nYour sister's poor planning is not your problem.  She should have started hunting for sitters a lot earlier.  Her attempts at a guilt trip deserve nothing but contempt."]}
