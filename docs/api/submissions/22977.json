It\u2019s completely inappropriate for your mom to be allowing you to have those thoughts at your age. \n\nI understand that growing up is a process and it takes a really long time sometimes for people to be able to see when their parents are taking advantage of them. But i will say it anyway because hopefully one day you will remember this. \n\nAs someone who has a mom just like yours. You need to set boundaries because she is using you. And no one that has a normal mom would ever disagree with me.\n\nIf i wasnt clear earlier. Please please please do not give your mom ANY money for a house.

The odds of her dropping bob are low and you'll end up paying to live with bob.", "NTA\n\nDo NOT pool your money with your mother to buy the house, OP. Save it for your future.", "NTA. A parent should put their child first, not the other way around. My best advice for you is, rather than signing yourself up for a job you know you won't like, is to invest in your future. I do think it's a good idea to put away some money, but do it so that you can get out of that home and away from Bob. You deserve to be in a positive environment that sets you up for success. I'm sorry your mother is letting this cruddy man stay around her kids and dictate so much of life.", "NTA. Helping her buy a house is just enabling the relationship and will permanently entangle you in her bad relationship. For instance, if she's a co-owner you won't be able to legally ban him from the house. \n\nWait longer and save up when you can buy a place yourself. At that point you can choose to invite her in or not.", "nta.  Don\u2019t let her control your destiny because of some bum she likes to stay with", "NTA - you are not obligated to help your mom. No offense but you are still a child. In an ideal world, your mom would organize her finances and move out to find a partner that respects her and treats you all better.", "My advice is to definitely NOT contribute to helping your mom buy a house if she\u2019s going to stay with her abusive boyfriend. At some point, she\u2019ll have to stand up for herself, and leave him. But until she does, you need to focus on taking care of yourself. If you (and your brother?) move into an apartment without her, you can tell her she\u2019s welcome to come stay with you when ever she leaves him, until she gets back up on her feet. At that point, if she can prove to you she\u2019s solidly over her ex (will take some time), THEN you can revisit the plan to all (you, brother, and mom) buy a house together", "NTA. You are (legally) a child, and as such have no financial obligations to your mom. Save your money for your own house when you are older, not hers.", "NTA", "Info: Are you planning on getting your own place?\n\nBecause it's one thing to say I'm getting my own apartment, it's another to say well I'm going to live here and not pay a dime.", "NTA do what you need to do to get yourself into a better position, if your mum is not on the same page she will understand eventually. You will be enabling what is an obvious mistake by paying for her and her abusive partners new place. Get out, help yourself first and don\u2019t let guilt stop you because you will be helping her eventually (when you can).", "NTA- but you need to look after yourself if she plans on staying with him. You can also start building your credit now so you buy a house of your own at some point. If it\u2019s your house, you can set the rules about who lives there. Is your brother going to help?", "NTA. Focus on getting yourself set up for success. That means not trusting your mom. She has chosen to stay with and prioritize an unhealthy relationship. Until she seeks help for that, she can't help anyone else.", "NTA.. save up money and get yourself out of tgat house and away from those people", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
