A parent should put their child first, not the other way around. My best advice for you is, rather than signing yourself up for a job you know you won't like, is to invest in your future.

And I don't mean to sound rude, but I'm extremely worried that you just don't understand how expensive it is to actually own a home (not even factoring in how expensive houses are these days!)

And it sounds like you're paying for a pricy downpayment and contributing toward the bills for a house in someone else's name?!\n\nYour mother is financially responsible for you until you turn 18. Save every penny until then. When you turn 18, get out. One thing I've learned about people who enable toxic partners is that they tend to be just as toxic in their own way. I would know, I'm surrounded by people like that. Your mother is using you to buy her and her alcoholic boyfriend a home. And if she needs help buying a house, why not the boyfriend? Trying to rely on her underage daughter to contribute to the household and help her buy a house makes her a massive asshole.\n\nDo. Not. Do.

Not be responsible as your mother's adult partner. You are parentified, having adult responsibilities and concerns shifted to you by your mom.

Most states require a CNA to be 18 for licensing purposes", "NTA.  But you need to understand that you don't owe your mother what you think you do.
