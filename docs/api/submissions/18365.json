Make a budget to pay set bills, come to agreement with debt collectors and involve the kids so they can experience budgeting especially for groceries and stick to it. Look into ways to bulk up what you make for cheap, you said 6 sloppy each but is that just straight meat and sauce? What about adding blended lentils or beans?

You act like they are nothing to him. The stepdad briefly stepped up, but technically he isn't really anything to them at this point, but still gets the survivor benefit for the kids. The bio dad is useless, as you mentioned, so he's another jackass.   \n\n\nJust a suggestion, but have the survivor benefit transferred to you. Keep the kids in their school. Allow the stepdad to keep in contact and have visitation, since he's the only father they've really ever known. Sue for child support from the deadbeat bio dad.", "Send them to him, he getting paid for them not you, si they are his responsibility.", "YTA. You're making decisions about your husband's grandkids, who he has plenty of legal and moral obligation to, all without talking to him. \n\nAnd the decision you're making is \"I'm going to throw the orphans away and make it clear we don't love or care about them\". You can plead poverty all you want, but that's the message you're sending. \n\nThey've lost their mother, their stepfather has started a new family and now they've limited contact with him, and now some of their closest relatives are sending the message they are unwanted and uncared for. They're current school and town is familiar, and they're leaning on your home for stability. Taking that away cannot be your first choice; you need to eliminate *all* the other possibilities first.\n\nTheir stepdad may have stepped up, but that doesn't remove any of the obligations on your husband.", "FYI sometimes those survivor checks can be a decent chunk of change. We\u2019re talking 300-400 a month when I was a minor over a decade ago.

I guess supporting himself and his new girlfriend and her kids.", "The athletics is the whole reason .", "Yes, this was my stepdaughter, but she was allready an adult with 3 kids when I met and married him. He makes about half what I do, and he bought 2 new vehicles without consulting me before the kids came, and the payments are more than he makes, so the burden is on me.

I just asked to make sure I wasn't an ass. Thank you for making assumptions.", "That would be true if the financial burden wasn't being placed on me.

The athletics is the excuse that's easy to articulate, because subconscious isn't.\n\nThis is their home; the school and town they know. Its familiar and safe. They've lost their mom, their pop has a new family, and they don't feel comfortable fitting into it.    \nWhether its that their pop doesn't want them or they're just not feeling welcome, its the same discomfit. \n\nI'm sure they like being able to continue their athletics, but I don't think its the whole reason. A large part of it is its a routine, familiarity and stability.", "It really sounds like the whole lot of them have been, and continue to, use you/take advantage of your generosity. You may be better off washing your hands of all of it, including the marriage (and I don't say that lightly).", "Literally none of that is a counterargument to anything I said. You're just repeating yourself, and you're still an AH", "Already did. Twice.

Look clearly I don't know how much as it depend on several factors but my mom got 2k ish a month for me and my sibling(3 then 2) before we aged out 20 years ago. They need financial help that they should be but are not getting.", "How is the grandfather more obligated when the stepdad who has legal custody is taking the kids' money and using it on himself and his new family. This would be totally different if he was providing the needed funds to help support these kids and they are being thrown to the wayside. However, the stepdad wants his cake and eat it too. \n\nDon't put the blame on her when there are two other adult males that should be contributing to their kids support. Their bio-dad and their legal dad (pop).", "You may need to contact a lawyer. You need to formalise the custody arrangement.", "Then the first solution should be to address that, rather than the nuclear option that's going to re-traumatise their grandkids.", "Actually, yes: I *will* blame her for not realising that if the one other remaining parent whose been a part of their lives, after their mother died, is becoming more and more less-engaged with their lives; that that means making \"send them away\" the first option instead of investigating and eliminating either possibility is going to cause serious mental stress and trauma. That's not discounting the finacial hardship of the OP, that's recongisning she's not using foresight and avoiding looking for the other steps she should be taking first.      \nThat other people are failing their contribution doesn't remove her responsibilities to consider how her actions will impact them when they're leaning on their grandparents for stability.", "Thank you"]}
