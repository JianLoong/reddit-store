You can plead poverty all you want, but that's the message you're sending. \n\nThey've lost their mother, their stepfather has started a new family and now they've limited contact with him, and now some of their closest relatives are sending the message they are unwanted and uncared for.

To be fair op never said but I doubt he never mentioned his financial troubles. It seems really obvious that step dad is milking the boys money for his new family and just care as much about his step kids anymore. I mean, if you received money for kids you dumped on someone else, how are you not the literally asshole who pockets the money for yourself instead if giving it to the person caring for the kids?
