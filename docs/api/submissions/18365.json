You want to tell them that he does not have physical custody of the children, he is living somewhere else, and that the children are with you- this can all be proven through school records.\n\nAt the same time, go down to the courthouse and ask for Family Advocacy (or whatever similar office your state has).

Emphasize that the children are safe with you but that their family is not being responsible for their children.  Demand a welfare check on the father in his home so that they see that his kids are not living there.\n\nContact your welfare office and ask for emergency assistance.  You may qualify for a number of things from energy assistance to emergency funds to food stamps.  Be honest with them and tell them everything.  You don't want fraud on your side.  If they say no, tell CPS, the Family Advocacy, and the SSA because again, these kids are legally abandoned and they deserve protection.  Verbal agreements of living arrangements are not custodial agreements- and you deserve to be paid for what you are doing.\n\nPrepare for the fact that a lawsuit should potentially happen- if not know, when those kids turn 18, they have the right to sue the custodial parent for lack of care given that there were checks specifically in their name that was not used for their care.  We are talking potentially thousands of dollars per kid.\n\nContact your local mental health center and start appointments for everyone- and get the therapist/social worker to help verify everything that is happening for you.  Get a case manager to help you.  That is what they are there for.\n\nI wish you luck with this situation but please, do not give up.
