You now no longer want to date him because of how he reacted when told 'no' and it has nothing to do with his religion and is purely personality based at this time.", "You're NTA and by disrespecting your opinion and your \"no\", I guess this guy is doing exactly what you don't like about religion.", "NTA, religious incompatibility is a serious problem in relationships and it's absolutely a good enough reason not to date someone. However, in this case 'you're an asshole who refuses to take no for an answer and I don't owe you an explanation' would have reason enough, religious or not.", "Absolutely NTA. Religion is, or at least can be, a massive part of someone's life and influence their outlook on the world. It's a fundamental incompatibility - why waste your time *and* his when you already know that's something you don't want in your life? \n\nAnd besides, he should have just taken \"no\" for an answer from the very beginning.", "NTA\n\nNot sure the rules in the UK but this CO-Worker not only asked you on a date (is that ok in your company) but he did not take No thank you as an answer, he demanded a reason and then berated you.  All of that could get him written up for creating a hostile workplace if you're so inclined to report him. \n\nYou've never been disrespectful to him, you offered a kind 'No' to his request, but he kept pushing.  He doesn't know what your life was like, he has no right to judge your experience.  \n\nYou have a choice in who you want to date.  You are not religious, and you know you would not be well matched with anybody who is, especially somebody who's on the conservative end of the religious spectrum.  \n\nConsider talking to HR about you, he sounds like he might be vindictive and it would be good to have something on file.", "NTA and please make HR aware as he would likely be badmouthing you to people. You are not a bigot and are entitled to date who you want to.", "NTA, no is a complete sentence and he disregarded it. Plus, not wanting to date very religious people from any religion is a compatibility issue, you don't have to date someone to prove that you respect their religion.", "NTA. He lives his life by a set of values that you don't share. Besides, his not accepting your initial rejections are kind of a red flag anyway.", "NTA, you have the right not to want to date someone. \n\nPlease go to HR and your manager to report this, and if you have a union join it and then raise this with them the next time he tries it (which he will). I'm in the UK too and when issues have arisen at work just mentioning I'll be speaking to the union for advice gets things sorted surprisingly quickly.", "NTA. Your reasons are valid. It is no different than people who won't date outside their religion. It is not biggotted in the world of dating. He also should not have persisted and taken the \"No\" as the final answer.

You can reject him for whatever reason you want. \n\n>I said I surely do respect him as a person but I don't want to date someone with this religion because I know from first-hand experience how it can ruin my sanity.\n\nThis is perfectly fine, IMO.\n\n>He has been calling me a biggot and I was wondering. Was I the AH here?\n\nHe's mistaken and probably hurt at being rejected. I think his Holy book says that he shouldn't be dating non Muslims, so would he admit that the Quran was a bad book?", "NTA. Accepting different opinions doesn't mean you are obliged to date or even like that opinion. He just can't accept the refusal.", "NTA! Definitely not.\n\nOnly self-entitled people hurt in their little ego tell you you\u2019re a \u2018bigot\u2019 for not wanting to date them. It\u2019s manipulative.", "NTA. You not wanting anything to do with people in a particular cult especially one that hurt you is valid and yes I said cult because the only difference between a cult and  an established religion is how accepted it is in a particular community.

First and foremost, no means no. Not maybe, not ask me again later, not \"isn't this a fun game?\" It means no. \n\nSecondly, any devotee of any religion, and in some cases atheism, knows or should know that there are people who have a problem with what they believe/dont believe. This does not make them a bad person, just someone with a different opinion.

Religion is a big part of people's life and sometimes people just don't want to be part of all that. So it's perfectly fine to opt out of dealing with that in a relationship by rejecting them. Plus, why do you need a reason to reject someone, dudes just not your cup of tea.", "NTA, having preferences is normal.", "NTA \n\nSeems like he's a living negative stereotype. Just as religious freedom is a thing, you're free to reject religion as a whole. It's also your choice whom you want around you, regardless of your reasoning. He's attempting to gaslight you, which is, sorry to say, smth that is not uncommon in religious muslim men. It's always the woman at fault. They're patriarchs. (Yes, yes, stereotypes, but in this case it's applicable). \n\nConsider taking things to the police/court/HR for sexual harassment. He will likely not leave you alone otherwise.", "NTA. \"No.\" is a complete sentence. You are not required to give a reason and I think you dodged a bullet. A person this pushy about going on a date isn't going to be satisfied with your personal beliefs until they match his.", "I'm gonna go with NTA, you are within your right to pick who you associate with. And we're 100% allowed to have preferences in who we date. \n\nHowever you don't mention if he actually holds those oppressive views or not. I do think it's kind of a dick move to assume everyone of a group is going to be as oppressive as the ones from your youth.\n\nMy wife was raised (and home schooled) in a Christian cult that used the Bible as an excuse to beat kids, be racist, force girls into only learning \"Wife-ing\" and nothing else past GED level education (because that's legally required)\n\nWhen she finally escaped she held immense hatred and aversion towards all the Abrahamic religions. Seeing any believers the same as those people. While a lot of them are, no group is a monolith there are truely loving theists. \n\nIt took a long time of talking about and studying theism to get over this (for lack of a better word) \"phobia\". She's still distrustful as a default, but letting go of all that hate really helped her figure life out.\n\nOn the other hand crazy Christo-Facists are on the rise here, and we're both a little fearful for our future here. \n\nNote: I am not a believer, but I didn't have bad experiences in church as a child.\n\nTLDR: NTA, but not all ______s are evil.", "NTA. He kept bothering you, and you were truthful.", "No means no, even if the story was just this:  \n\n\n>The other day he asked me out on a date. I politely rejected him.

Apparently, \"I don't want to date anyone right now\" is not a good reason.\n\n  \nOr if you were just raised int he UK and don't want to date a religious person.

Definitely NTA also I'd contact HR if he continues to bother you.", "Absolutely NTA. I completely get not wanting to date someone who strictly practices a religion because that will influence your entire relationship, even without having made the experiences you\u2019ve had that have so strongly influenced your sanity. And considering that he did not respect your original no and reasoning and kept pressuring you, you\u2019re double not the asshole, he is.", "NTA, you don't ever need a reason to reject someone's advances. Him hounding you for one is chauvinistic harassment.", "NTA and as someone who was also raised in an religious muslim country (albeit admittedly less oppressive I guess) I totally get your stance and respect it. go forth and live your life as you wish sister. much love.", "NTA, you told him the truth and he couldn\u2019t handle it. I feel your respect for him is dwindling though.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nYour initial knock back should have been enough. He should not have continued to harass you. He has zero right to be belittling your reasons for not liking him. Calling you a bigot is disgusting. This is a place of work. Tell him to leave you alone now, and if he doesn\u2019t, go to HR.", "NTA you can reject someone for any reason, he's just demonstrated you've decided well.", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, you don't need a reason to reject someone, or to leave a relationship as a matter of fact. Not wanting it is enough.\n\nBeyond that, the reality is heavily religious people are very hard to live with, especially if they are from an extremely Muslim country (downvote me to hell, the way they treat women is horrible, I'll die on that hill). And you have experienced it first hand which makes your reason to reject him perfectly legitimate.\n\nAnd his reaction only proves that he wasn't willing to prove you wrong that he might be Muslim but is different - he literally just thinks you should accept the way he would oppress you with his religion", "NTA, and it's worth contacting HR about his harassment of you. One \"no\" should have been enough.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nNo is a full sentence. Him pestering you for a reason absolutely makes him the AH.\n\nI suppose you could have phrased it differently but again... he didn't need an answer beyond \"No\" he just pushed you into a corner with his barage of questions. \n\nHonestly it might be worth you bringing this up with your team leader or HR depending where you work to avoid any issues if he tries to spread a story that you're a bigot rather than him badgering you for a relationship and not taking no for an answer.", "NTA. You politely rejected him and he harassed you until you gave him an \"impolite\" answer. He wants to bully you into dating him and at this point, depending on your workplace, it might be worth escalating.", "NTA, not only did you not have to necessarily give him in-depth reasons but your reason is legitimate. Values are extremely important when it comes to relationships and what is a religion if not a set of values?", "If he's your coworker you should report him to your boss because he's harassing you.

It\u2019s not bigotry to refuse to date someone who doesn\u2019t share your core values/has outright conflicting core values.", "Nta no means no.", ">When you sugarcoat the no and they demand the real reason? Further asshole. \n\nIn most cases, if somebody is pushing for a reason after you've said no to a request by them, it's best not to give it to them. Giving a reason only prolongs what in their mind is still a negotiation. This applies to pushy people asking you out, pushy salesman, pushy entitled friends etc.", "You have a choice in who you want to date.", "This is such a good response!", "Absolutely. I seriously had so many mental health issues back at home. Normal people there don't behave like this but our government's rules are absurd. With these kinds of dudes, they live in the free world but have a cage made out of religion around them. I would feel so suffocated.", ">Not sure the rules in the UK\n\nWorkplace harassment is closest, especially that he wouldn't take the no and insisted on an explanation, then called her an AH and a bigot. (Equality Act 2010 protects employees from unwanted behaviour that amongst other things can cause an intimidating or hostile situation at work).", "I think you're looking for Antitheism, rather than Atheism.\n\nAthiests generally are perfectly content for other people to believe what they choose, but discontent usually forms if other people try and force that on them. I concede there a few people who still have an issue with Athiests not having any religion in a 'how can you not believe' way, though. \n\nAntitheists are opposed to belief in the existence of a God, and are the ones who preach as much as some religious people do.", "He also called her an AH for how she thinks. Huge red flag.", "Of course I don't think that every muslim is an oppressive backwards-thinking person. I just don't want people like that around me. And this guy prays 5 times a day, takes fasting seriously and this is more than 95% of what normal people in my country do. My home country's government is oppressive, not the people.", "I'd say his reaction to her polite rejection and the fact that he berated her for how she thinks are good indicators of his views on women.", "Yeah that's pretty deep into it. Definitely NTA, I would continue to avoid him and depending on your HR teams track record report him to management. \n\nHere in the states it's really common for women to report someone for harassment and get fired themselves. Not sure if that's the case there."]}
