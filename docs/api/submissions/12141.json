The rooms are allocated based on a waiting list or a lottery system so we don\u2019t get to choose our roommates. \nMy boyfriend (28M) recently moved into the same dorm but in a different building. He got a room with a private bathroom whereas I need to share mine with 4 others. His kitchen is shared by 8 people just like mine but is also a lot bigger so we spend most of our time in his room. This is completely allowed btw as many students live with more roommates to save money. Since we are at the university all day, we only use the kitchen to cook dinner every night and on weekends. We even eat our food in his room so in total we spend like 60 min in the kitchen per day during non-quiet hours. His next door roommate (20sF) is home all day as she writes her thesis from her room. Her room is also right next to the kitchen so I guess she can hear everything more clearly than us.  She has asked my bf to walk quietly when in the kitchen and has also asked her bf to tell him. We obliged and are more careful now. However, that\u2019s still not up to her standards I guess as she wrote a very rude letter to us saying that we walk too \u2018heavily\u2019 in the kitchen while barefoot (we\u2019re never barefoot) and it feels like we\u2019re knocking on her door with a hammer. She also said that the sound of us closing our closet door (like once everyday) disturbs her and she can\u2019t concentrate even with noise cancelling headphones (we share a wall). The thing is, we can also hear her close her doors but I think it\u2019s just part of living in a shared space with thin walls. She\u2019s saying that we\u2019re causing her nervous breakdowns every time we\u2019re in the kitchen. We wrote her back saying we\u2019ll be more quiet during the quiet hours and we aren\u2019t purposely trying to walk loudly but she could go to the library if she can\u2019t concentrate from her room as she can\u2019t tell people how to exist in common areas during non quiet hours.\nMe or my bf have never had anyone complain about the way we walk before and we just cook normally and leave. I think she is being unreasonable. But are we wrong to expect her to suck it up as it\u2019s a common space?", "created_utc": 1678644337, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11pl7pj/aita_for_ignoring_my_housemates_request_of_being/", "score": 333, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
