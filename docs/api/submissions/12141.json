The rooms are allocated based on a waiting list or a lottery system so we don\u2019t get to choose our roommates. \nMy boyfriend (28M) recently moved into the same dorm but in a different building. He got a room with a private bathroom whereas I need to share mine with 4 others. His kitchen is shared by 8 people just like mine but is also a lot bigger so we spend most of our time in his room. This is completely allowed btw as many students live with more roommates to save money. Since we are at the university all day, we only use the kitchen to cook dinner every night and on weekends. We even eat our food in his room so in total we spend like 60 min in the kitchen per day during non-quiet hours. His next door roommate (20sF) is home all day as she writes her thesis from her room. Her room is also right next to the kitchen so I guess she can hear everything more clearly than us.  She has asked my bf to walk quietly when in the kitchen and has also asked her bf to tell him. We obliged and are more careful now. However, that\u2019s still not up to her standards I guess as she wrote a very rude letter to us saying that we walk too \u2018heavily\u2019 in the kitchen while barefoot (we\u2019re never barefoot) and it feels like we\u2019re knocking on her door with a hammer. She also said that the sound of us closing our closet door (like once everyday) disturbs her and she can\u2019t concentrate even with noise cancelling headphones (we share a wall). The thing is, we can also hear her close her doors but I think it\u2019s just part of living in a shared space with thin walls. She\u2019s saying that we\u2019re causing her nervous breakdowns every time we\u2019re in the kitchen. We wrote her back saying we\u2019ll be more quiet during the quiet hours and we aren\u2019t purposely trying to walk loudly but she could go to the library if she can\u2019t concentrate from her room as she can\u2019t tell people how to exist in common areas during non quiet hours.\nMe or my bf have never had anyone complain about the way we walk before and we just cook normally and leave. I think she is being unreasonable. But are we wrong to expect her to suck it up as it\u2019s a common space?", "created_utc": 1678644337, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11pl7pj/aita_for_ignoring_my_housemates_request_of_being/", "score": 147, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your neighbour is on the verge of a nervous breakdown it's because she is witing a thesis. PhD students have a very high burnout rate as writing the thesis is extremely nerve wracking. It has nothing to do with you and your BF, it's not your fault she can no longer stand the every day sounds of joint dorm living.\n\nI feel sorry for her though. If she is in the writing phase of her project and no longer has to do courses or experiments, she better move back home with her folks for a few months to have peace and quiet. And if they live in a small apartment on a noisy street, maybe she can move to an aunt in the country side for a while or to an off-season vacation resort.\n\nAnyway, she cannot expect the whole rest of the dorm walk on eggs around her.

If you and your boyfriend are making normal levels of noise and not being ridiculous (some people do everything so loudly and do not realize how much they disturb people) and are trying to be quieter for her, then you're going above and beyond. \n\nAt this point, I would have your boyfriend give the RA a heads up about what's happened and that there's nothing else you can do to accomodate since you're allowed to live there, open and close doors, and use the kitchen.
