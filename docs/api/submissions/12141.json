I\u2019ve learned a lot since then, so hopefully this perspective helps.\n\nI also went to a college that had a senior thesis and student living for all four years with very little control over our space or who we lived with. I literally still have the occasional nightmare about it.\n\nAt the time, I hadn\u2019t yet been diagnosed as neurodivergent, but I could tell that the constant noise in our dorms was a problem for me in a way it didn\u2019t seem to be for other people. When it got bad, it felt like I couldn\u2019t get a moment of quiet long enough to catch my breath. Once the sounds really started getting to me, I heard EVERYTHING, and even things that normally would have been fine became agonizing. Not surprisingly, this would get worse when I was under a lot of stress (like writing my senior thesis).\n\nSo to address a few judgements that are being made in the comments:\n\n1. Yep, it\u2019s totally possible that these sounds are pushing the roommate into ND meltdowns or similar. No, she wouldn\u2019t necessarily be hospitalized for them (wtf?).\n2. Even though I had this issue identified enough to try and advocate for myself and for housing with better sound insulation (reasonable accommodation for a disability, though I didn\u2019t have the language or paperwork for it at the time), the administration blew me off as \u201cspoiled\u201d and never considered why I might be asking or what effect this was having on my overall health (developed a bunch of other physical stress symptoms, yay! /s).\n3. As thrilled as I am to have general understanding of neurodiversity growing in recent years, it\u2019s still incredibly expensive and challenging to get an official diagnosis, especially as a woman and even more so if you\u2019re not white.\n4. When my nervous system is fired up, common/public spaces like the library are not a solution. They may be quieter, but then there are other things going on and you have to mask.\n5. Moving home with her parents may not be possible and may not be better. That\u2019s not on the table unless she puts it there.\n6. She\u2019s not a bad person for being in pain. If the worst she\u2019s done is a strongly worded letter protesting the additional noise of a person who\u2019s not on the lease, that\u2019s pretty decent.\n\n**Dorms are a shit situation for everyone involved.** It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re frustrated and feel like you\u2019re being reasonable. I also fully believe that it does sound like stomping and hammering to her. \n\nI do agree that two people are louder than one, no matter how quiet you try to be, you\u2019re almost certainly talking to each other. That was an issue in one of my housing situations - the person with a shared wall always had the person they were dating over, so even if the actual person who lived there would be in class, the extra person would be there making noise.\n\nA few pieces of advice:\n\n1. It\u2018s your boyfriend\u2019s roommate, not yours, so he should be the one who handles this. He\u2019s 28. You\u2019re still responsible for your behavior when you\u2019re there, but this is for him and his roommates to discuss and resolve without you. Ganging up on her will not help at all, so the only third party who would be involved would be a good RA. You would then be responsible for following any guest guidelines the people who officially live there have decided on and agreed to.\n2. The comment suggesting a possible room swap within the apartment is a good one. No, it might not seem \u201dfair,\u201c but it could be more *equitable* and a reasonable accommodation for sensory issues.\n3. That said, going into this trying to diagnose her or telling her she\u2019s sick is only going to make it worse (thanks societal ableism /s). Focus your language on how the sound seems to be disproportionately affecting her and everyone wants to find a solution that\u2019s healthy for everyone.\n4. She may need an extra quiet week for her nervous system to reset. If you can stay in your room instead if his and stay out of his kitchen for a week, the roommate will probably be in a better position to have these not-fun discussions about accommodations and apartment rules. It would also be a good show that you do care and want her to be well. It\u2018s not something you have to do, and (again) it may not feel \u201cfair,\u201d but it would likely help the situation. \n\n**TL;DR I\u2019ve been that person, she\u2019s in sensory hell right now. I get that you\u2019re involved, but this is for the boyfriend who officially lives there to handle. Please know that you\u2019re reasonably frustrated** ***and*** **she\u2019s in pain.
