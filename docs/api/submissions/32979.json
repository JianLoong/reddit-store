She didn't engage in conversations and had excessive cleanliness standards, even placing bath towels over Airbnb pillowcases.\n\nThe most challenging part was her attitude at night. We were excited to experience the nightlife, being underage back home. But Jessica wouldn't participate, preferring to play Sudoku on her phone.\n\nHer social media posts added to the frustration.

Unless you guys want to be painted as bullies by Jessica, you should tell her directly how her actions affected you guys.", "NTA.  I'm gonna guess Jessica will get upset about it, but you can gently tell her that based on the last trip you don't seem to have compatible travel preferences.", "Whyyyyy would you even consider taking Jessica with you, she had such a miserable time with you. You just wouldn\u2019t think of putting her through that again, you won\u2019t hear of it! Nope, absolutely not!\n\nAnd that\u2019s what you tell her when she wants to insert herself into your next trip. NTA", "NTA. You have every right to fully enjoy your vacation without having to put up with a downer travel companion:  \n*jess, we think it's clear from the last trip that we are not compatible for traveling together*", "NTA - if she asks, just say you don\u2019t want her to be so unhappy, like on the last trip.", "NTA but there is a good chance that all of you going on a trip without her will affect your relationship further. To mitigate this you should talk to her rather than planning a trip behind her back and having her find out. It\u2019s unfortunate that no one had a conversation with her during or after the last trip itself, as she may have a different memory of that trip in hindsight.\n\nI would choose whoever you think would best deliver the message (rather than all of you talking to her at once) and have a conversation.", "If you want to be super direct, you could say: \u201cJessica, I think we have different travel styles. I\u2019m going on a trip with A, B, and C. We\u2019re only going to eat local cuisine, we\u2019re going to stay out til 2 am, and we\u2019re spending all day walking and looking at history. Last time, you did not enjoy these things, so we are not inviting you this year.\u201d If you want to compromise, you could do a local trip with the whole group before your international trip. Go to a state park or a cool city that you often don\u2019t get to, bring her with, have some fun", "NTA- I traveled with two very good long-term friends, both of whom were actually closer with each other than with me, pre- trip .\n\nBut they have this toxic behavior when they travel together. And I turned into the sympathetic middle child as both of them would take me aside and discuss with me their problems with the other. \n\nNever again!\nAfter a couple of trips, it changed their relationship when they weren't traveling to. It just exasperated eventually", "Jessica sounds deeply unhappy. But NTA.", "NTA and it\u2019s understandable that you feel that way; however, before you exclude your friend, you need to decide if you\u2019re ready to cut ties entirely. Because this will likely end the friendship completely and make things potentially very awkward if you all live with her.", "NTA - sounds like she went on this trip just to tell people she went, not to actually enjoy it. Else why would she claim it was the rest of you bringing down the atmosphere? Don't invite, and personally, if she asks - be honest with her about why. She can take a trip somewhere SHE wants to go, doing things SHE wants to do without you guys and without spoiling your plans. Or maybe after you tell her why, she'll admit to her shortcomings and not do it anymore.... possible for sure but doubtful.", "Plan your trip, go on your trip and be honest and tell her she spoilt your last experience with her \"debbie downer\" attitude. No more chances, you pay for a good trip, the last thing you want to deal with is an entitled narcissist. Yeah, the friendship is probably over but let's face it, was it a really good friendship anyway. No TA", "[deleted]", "I\u2019ll repeat some comments here\u2026 This is likely the first time you\u2019ve dealt with this but you have to ask yourself: What was her motivation to make you all seem like poor companions? Attention? Sympathy from internet randos? \n\nIn any case, she\u2019s not invited, and you can tell her why. This is how we learn.\n\nIt\u2019s clear she wants to be included, but also wants to emotionally hijack situations with her funky behavior. \n\nShe probably also isn\u2019t aware this is inappropriate. Again, she\u2019s got to be told\u2026 if she\u2019s interested in becoming a better friend, she should be open to listening. I have a feeling this happens to her a lot.", "ESH - Of course you should not travel again with someone who behaved so poorly the last time. Having said that, I assume you are all adults, and adults have discussions even if they are uncomfortable. When you got back from the last trip, did any of you have a discussion with her about how much she\u2019d diminished the trip? I am guessing not. So it may very well come as a shock when you tell her you don\u2019t want her along this time.", "Nta and don't include her. If she makes the group miserable then she staus home.", "NTA. Trips like this really can make you see the true colors of friends. If she acted that way, why even bother to be there? Stay home, Jessica.", "I wouldn\u2019t invite her. These are trips of a lifetime and your money. No one want to spend it with a Debbie downer. \n\nY", "NTA Nope not at all", "NTA\n\nGrab screenshots of some of her social media posts from the last trip then if she mentions not being invited, you can remind her what a terrible time she had last time.\n\nps. what's wrong with putting a towel over the airbnb pillow?", "NTA. Group travelling is hard and if everyone doesn't have the right attitude and approach then it turns an expensive and looked-forward-to trip into a nightmare.\n\nI travelled with two of my friends overseas and it was clear that my interests deviated from theirs at times. Little things like they'd sleep in and not be ready to go out until nearly noon whereas I'd be up and raring to go for hours. I also had a not-quite-healed knee injury and sometimes they'd want to do a lot of walking. We found compromises. I'd wander off by myself and do my own thing in the morning and come back with coffee and breakfast for them when they woke up. \n\nI'd go off and explore things I was interested in when they wanted to go on long walking adventures and then we'd meet up and go from there. Because we were all there with positive attitudes and communication, it worked really well and I didn't feel segregated at all.", "I have no problem going with friends and family to destinations, but we( wife and two kids) will be doing what we want on our trip. If our interests align great. If not also fine also fine, have a blast. We might not even see you until the next morning for breakfast. We make this very clear before we go. You shouldn\u2019t let others ruin your trip you spent good money on. I would of told her have fun bitching by the pool with a Big Mac and fries.", "NTA - just dont tell her. I mean this really isn\u2019t a conflict, just dont invite her? If it comes up then deal with it appropriately", "YTA for not talking to her about it. I don\u2019t blame her at all for the cleanliness standards and I don\u2019t understand why you care if she puts a towel over a pillow. \n\nIf it was bothering all of you and you were talking behind her back instead of addressing it, then you are jerks.", "NTA.  Travelling is about experiencing things that are different than they are at home.  It sounds like she prefers home, so she can remain behind.  \n\nHowever, you can give her a chance.  You need to explain to her that you plan to make the most of the local culture, food, night life, etc, and that you are not going to be bothered if things are not up to standard back home.  And if she wants to come, then she has to embrace this too.  And let her know that you are not going to give into her demands.  If she doesn't want to do something then she will be left on her own.  Chances are she will back out.  If she does decide to go, then you must be firm and be prepared to leave her behind.", "Her attitude is the problem, but what she chooses to eat or how she wants to protect her face while sleeping is HER business and should have NOTHING to do with how you feel about her.\n\nNTA ONLY due to her constant rude conversations on the phone BUT YWBTA if you bring her food choices and cleanliness habits into the decision.", "ugh, should have been dealt with at the time, now its just mean girl vibes.\n\nbe adults and deal with it!", "NTA. But don\u2019t be surprised if she is upset.\n\nI guess  I am wondering why Jessica\u2019s friends ( includes you) are not more concerned for her. She could have an emotional disorder, trauma, or a mental illness. She sounds very damaged.", "No, you deserve guys better, y\u2019all should not invite her to y\u2019all\u2019s trip.", "NTA she invited herself last time, you have no obligation to her, especially as she was being negative towards you over social media.
