Graduated college a couple years back, have a nice job now and live in my own house with a roommate who helps me cover rent. About six months ago my parents kicked my kid brother Kenneth, who is sixteen going on seventeen, out the house. I'm not completely sure what went on there because I've been away for years, but apparently he's been misbehaving, skipping school, stuff like that. My parents are pretty old so I can understand why they just ran out of energy. I'm not saying it was right but I get it.\n\nSince I'm doing well, when I heard about the situation I invited him to live with me. My roommate likes him and thinks he's cool, so it seemed like a good idea. Quickly though we realized Kenneth has a problem; he's a sleepwalker. He'll walk into walls and then start banging against them. Our house is made of drywall so it's easy to break. He's busted holes in the wall a couple of times already, and he's only been living here maybe three weeks. I'm not sure if he's having nightmares during or what. \n\nAfter enough times I decided to put his bed in the basement. He can still hang out upstairs during the day, just no falling asleep unless he goes to the basement first. I didn't tell my roommate about this rule, not intentionally but just because it didn't occur to me. Yesterday Kenneth came in from work and dozed off on the couch while we were watching TV. I woke him up and reminded him about being in the basement. He was like, \u201cOh yeah\u201d and went down there.\n\nMy roommate was confused, and I explained to him the rule and why I had it. He laughed and called me a dick. He knows about Kenneth's problem but in his eyes it's not that big of a deal, we can just have the walls in Kenneth's rooms padded or reinforced or find him some sleeping meds. I told him it's not that simple. That kind of rennovation would be expensive and I'm not Kenneth's guardian so it's not like I can make him go get pills. My roommate just said \u201cOkay,\u201d and rolled his eyes like I was making excuses. \n\nI feel like he can go fuck himself. He doesn't know me or my family situation, why would he make these kind of assumptions? I'm already doing a ton letting my brother stay here.

If you did and he\u2019s cool with it, no problem. But it\u2019s shitty to move his bed down to the basement without talking to him.", "If the basement is in reasonable shape and Kenneth is okay with that arrangement, then NTA.

Is it unfinished?  \n\nHas he been seen by a doctor for this sleepwalking?", "YTA for not insisting your brother go see a doctor. Sleep walking is often a symptom of something else. But NTA for the basement rule. Sleep walkers need a safe environment. The basement prevents him from falling down stairs. Take him to the doctor!!!", "INFO : Can he hurt himself will banging on the wall? How severe is the sleepwalking?\n\nYou brother is fine with it and you're not the primary caregiver, but sleep walking can be serious and someone as to check on him. And even if he was a accident baby, he is still their child and your parents have a obligation to take care of him. (and depending of the home situation, maybe he know he was unwanted and act out because of it)", "YTA. He could hurt himself very badly down there. Your brother needs medical attention immediately, and your parents are huge AHs for abandoning him.", "INFO\u2026..what is the condition of the basement? Would you want to sleep there? \n\nGet your brother some help from professionals.", "YTA for defending your parents and for not getting your brother seen by a doctor.  And also for your attitude towards your roommate.  He just offered some suggestions.", "Unless this is a finished basement with another means of egress, YTA. There's a reason they don't allow bedrooms in basements - they're a death trap in a fire. \n\nIt sounds like your brother may have a sleeping disorder. That should be checked out. Your parents need to take him to a doctor.", "YTA Not even for your solution, which your brother doesn't seem to mind, but with your entire attitude here. Your roommate isn't wrong to suggest other alternatives. He really should talk to a doctor before he's seriously injured. \n\nAlso you're way off base to say you understand your parents running out of energy. They CHOSE to have a child at whatever age they are. They don't get to just decide not to be parents anymore because they're \"out of energy\".", "I don\u2019t understand all these people who say that YTA because you won\u2019t give him medical help. You\u2019re his brother, not his parents. If anyone should be coughing up money for his sleeping problems it should be them, not you. The arrangement doesn\u2019t sound super but you\u2019re making the best out a bad situation and you haven\u2019t kicked him out for it when a lot of other people would so I\u2019m gonna say NTA.", "INFO: are you personally involved in his care? Are you up to speed in conversations with Al\u2019s doctor?", ">He doesn't know me or my family situation, why would he make these kind of assumptions?\n\nNAH. It seems to me you made an assumption of your own, that blood is thicker than water, by making a decision about the terms of a long-term guest's living arrangements, and not cluing in your roommate. This may be excusable, but understand that your roommate is not under any obligation to agree with you on, really anything. He expressed doubts or disagreement \\[edit: quite reasonably in my view. Having a child, even a teen sleep in the basement can be a warning sign of neglect\\], as he has every right to do (I would take him calling you the d-word as more a reflection of you both being young and co-equal roommates rather than necessarily anything serious), and in the end seems accepting if not supportive of the arrangement. I don't really understand what you have to complain about.\n\nAs for your brother, I figure you're playing the hand you've been dealt.", "ESH I understand it's expensive, but how furnished is the basement? Is it a finished basement or is it a dark damp open space? You brother needs to see a Dr. there is something going on with him. This could also be contributing to his behavior.", "YTA. OP, your brother has a serious problem. Your parents failed to get him the help  he needs. Putting him in the basement is not going to help solve his problem. Please talk to Kenneth and sit him down, and tell him that he has to see a doctor immediately, a specialist in sleep disorders. Forget about what your roommate thinks, because you should take care of your brother first.", "\n\nNTA. It's understandable for your roommate to think that his suggestion may be a simpler and more cost effective solution, however in reality sleep walking is an issue that needs to be addressed in a way that guarantees your brother's safety. It sounds like you have done your best to accommodate your brother and keep him and your roommate safe in these circumstances.", "Tell ur roommate to literally mind his business, or pay for the padding / alternatives being added to his room. You\u2019re already doing enough by letting ur bother stay there", "NTA. Buddy is destroying walls. It doesn\u2019t sound like Kenneth is bothered by this arrangement either, if he does not want to look for medication or help for this, relocating to the basement is the safest option.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
