Mia would often cry about him missing her birthday but he would make up buy it by sending her consoles and makeup but it still hurt her that the guy didn't even bother showing up to her Birthday.\n\n\n\nMia is getting married soon and we were working on the guest list and when we were talking about who was walking her down the aisle she would constantly switch the conversation and me and my husband asked about it and she said she wants her biodad to walk her down the aisle. My husband said \"Bullshit I've been raising you forever it's not fair\" and mia replied \"my real dad bought me a car, he paid for my surgery, and he even sent  me money for a dog\".  My husband looked heartbroken and went out the house and told me he was going to the bar.\n\n\nMia looked at me and said \"sorry mom but I want him I know you and him have bad blood but I want him to do it I've been sending letters and he's been sending them back\". I then said something I regretted I said \"if you invite him I'm not giving you my wedding dress or coming\".

That's why she tried to side step the pressure from mum and step dad.

It's quite, let's say, not smart.\n\nAs to the second point, here's how I perceived it. The mum sucked it up when the girl said she'll invite the dad, I don't agree with that though never accept such nonsense, anyways, she accepted it but to make him walk her down, was unacceptable for her and her husband, it's like giving him too, much.", "You can argue either way about it tbh. You could also argue that by Mia asking her bio dad to walk her down the aisle she's telling her mum and step dad that she values the love they've given her less than the money her bio dad has given, that her love was essentially bought.\n\nShe's also showing that she doesn't feel the need to maintain the relationship with her mum and step dad since she's \"secured\" the relationship and as you said, they're not going anywhere. Which is a terrible thing to signal.\n\nShe can also learn the value of what she has if OP and her husband don't show up. She pushed the people who were there for her away in favour of someone who's never been there for her and at the end of the day neither show up because one's always been a flake and she pushed away the people who have always loved her. That's also a massive wake up call", "It doesn't mean he wasn't abusive, but if you can't be mad for someone at not being present while making it also clear that you would not have been comfortable if he did show up. It makes me think he was told not to show up and did what he could. I am not suggesting money = parenting, but he had regular contact with his daughter and it seems like he might have been doing the best he could given a situation where he wouldn't be allowed to visit.

First of all, abuse is never ok but I am wondering if biodad tried to go to birthday parties and other events but OP and SF made it uncomfortable to go to them. If OP is so triggered that she wouldn't go to Mia's wedding if biodad was there, she probably made it difficult for him to do any parenting and Mia had to sneak around to talk to him. We do not know how much of this is emotional abuse from their marriage or if OP is actually the narcissist. If what Mia says is true, he doesn't sound like he is. But if they were young and immature when they got married, it is very possible that stress would have caused the abuse and he has grown since then. Or he is still emotionally abusive. We don't know. We do know that biodad was there for his daughter whenever she needed him, both financially and emotionally. SF probably is a good man but he seems to have other interests besides raising his stepdaughter. I wonder if having biodad ruins OPs image of a perfect wedding and so she and her husband can play parents of the bride with her husband walking her daughter down the aisle. Need more info.

He also wasn't a total dead-beat dad because he paid $1500 a month in child support and provided her with other things that would have come out of your family's budget.  Paying for medical care and her car are significant expenses.

Stomping out of the house to go drink because stepdad didn't get his way isn't exactly the sign of a great father, either.\n\nI'm guessing the daughter has a closer relationship with her dad than OP knows, probably cause the daughter can't talk to her mom at all without anger and passive aggressiveness, so she keeps whatever relationship they have on the down low.

My ex abused my daughters and the youngest one is still having him a part of her life.  That reality really sucks for the abused parent. My ex abused me but because his mommy has money, he ended up with the kids. I will be walking my daughter down the aisle with a man who abused both me and her. It really sucks.

I lost daddy who taught me to play checkers as a little kid and would surprise me with fish and chips when I was home sick in high school.

Maybe he isn't. \n\nThis relationship started with two adults. \n\nSome relationships may fail because one person is a saint and the other is a demon. \n\nBut by far the more common reason for a relationship failing is that both persons in it behave so as to ensure it ends. \n\nChildren should not be bullied into taking sides between their mom and their dad.", "She shouldn't have to share what her ex did in detail for her daughter to feel something.", "Exactly.

OP doesn\u2019t owe her daughter attendance because her ADULT daughter is purposely doing something she knows her mother will not go for. Bio Dad did owe his daughter his attendance because she was a CHILD who did nothing wrong and deserved her father to be there.

If he was abusive, OP would still facilitate birthdays and invites to the father for birthday parties because that is what you do, as a co-parent. Even abusive parents get to see their children through the courts.

No, she's specifically angry because her feelings about biodad are not being acknowledged, and all that abuse is being shoved under the rug for the daughter's fee-fees.

I make it a point not to bad mouth my ex. However, my kids unfortunately saw a lot of the abuse.  I also agree that some woman are quick to say abuse, when reality is, they just were not meant for each other.  I get that. My personal situation has obviously made me bias and I don\u2019t mean to jump to conclusions without more info, but the info provided was very similar to how my ex is. There have been numerous times that even police officers wouldn\u2019t believe me. They wanted to see physical evidence. Well my ex would do things like slam the doorknob into my stomach over and over while having me pinned between the door and the wall. There were no marks other than my stomach being red.

Am I abusive now for his reaction to that?", "There was nothing in their comment to \u201ccalm down\u201d from.
