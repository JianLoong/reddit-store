My husband said \"Bullshit I've been raising you forever it's not fair\" and mia replied \"my real dad bought me a car, he paid for my surgery, and he even sent  me money for a dog\".  My husband looked heartbroken and went out the house and told me he was going to the bar.\n\n\nMia looked at me and said \"sorry mom but I want him I know you and him have bad blood but I want him to do it I've been sending letters and he's been sending them back\". I then said something I regretted I said \"if you invite him I'm not giving you my wedding dress or coming\".

First of all, abuse is never ok but I am wondering if biodad tried to go to birthday parties and other events but OP and SF made it uncomfortable to go to them. If OP is so triggered that she wouldn't go to Mia's wedding if biodad was there, she probably made it difficult for him to do any parenting and Mia had to sneak around to talk to him. We do not know how much of this is emotional abuse from their marriage or if OP is actually the narcissist. If what Mia says is true, he doesn't sound like he is. But if they were young and immature when they got married, it is very possible that stress would have caused the abuse and he has grown since then. Or he is still emotionally abusive. We don't know. We do know that biodad was there for his daughter whenever she needed him, both financially and emotionally. SF probably is a good man but he seems to have other interests besides raising his stepdaughter. I wonder if having biodad ruins OPs image of a perfect wedding and so she and her husband can play parents of the bride with her husband walking her daughter down the aisle. Need more info.

He also wasn't a total dead-beat dad because he paid $1500 a month in child support and provided her with other things that would have come out of your family's budget.  Paying for medical care and her car are significant expenses.  It also sounds like he did keep in touch with her even if he missed special events like birthdays.  \n\nI'm sorry your husband is hurt, but I think the parents in blended families too often think the bond between the stepchildren is greater than it really is.

Stomping out of the house to go drink because stepdad didn't get his way isn't exactly the sign of a great father, either.\n\nI'm guessing the daughter has a closer relationship with her dad than OP knows, probably cause the daughter can't talk to her mom at all without anger and passive aggressiveness, so she keeps whatever relationship they have on the down low.

If he was abusive, OP would still facilitate birthdays and invites to the father for birthday parties because that is what you do, as a co-parent.

The fact that the daughter cried because HE DIDN'T SHOW gives enough context that he HAD been invited, and HAD NOT decided to come. \n2. No, she's specifically angry because her feelings about biodad are not being acknowledged, and all that abuse is being shoved under the rug for the daughter's fee-fees.

I make it a point not to bad mouth my ex. However, my kids unfortunately saw a lot of the abuse.  I also agree that some woman are quick to say abuse, when reality is, they just were not meant for each other.  I get that.

I felt so alone in this world and was convinced that my own children didn't even love me. I wish she jusy made me cry often, that would have been a walk in the park. My ex make Amder Hearb look like mother Terresa.(mod said I can't reference a famous trial between a pirate actor and his ex)Also, a grandiose narcissist doesnt do it part time, its full time. Even when you think they are being nice they are just doing what's called love bombing. This immediately did not read like a victim of an ex abusive spouse. Maybe she has been to therapy and is in a way better place now (I know I am) and I'm just triggered but this sounds just like when my ex tries to vilify me to people. Your comment (not included anywhere in the original) states that your daughter said her father was there for her when nobody else was, it wasn't just about money. You make it sound as if that's the only reason. Most of this was bashing your ex, not truely listing out the rational reasons for both sides. You use a tactic at the end as well that I myself would never do as a victim and just a good dad and that's quantifying your love for your daughter as a weapon (you can use my dress if you do what i want, not what you want). Do you have any idea what that kind of abuse does to a person??? If you have had this done to you then you know that it is a horrific thing to do to someone. If you love someone then you don't dangle a carrot, you feed them a carrot. These few examples alone tell me that you are definitely not telling the whole story and also it tells me that you are not the victim of an abusive narcissist because you are giving examples of that abuse done by you in this very post.\n\nEdit: judgment, YTA because I don't think we remotely got the truth or whole story.", "Something about this seems incredible suspicious. Something about the way you're writing makes me think you don't actually care about your daughter at all, and that YOU are the narcissist here.

I've been NC for about a decade, but my sister still tries to have a relationship with him. She calls me crying when he makes her feel like shit but I don't say anything like, \"I told you so,\" or for her to just cut him off since that won't actually help her and she doesn't want to hear it.

All of his contributions to my life have been financial, and I did not see him with any regularity. My step dad had known me since I was 6 and been married to my mom since I was 10, and I consider both of them my dad. My biological dad did not do great, but financial support matters. The money he sent has given me a lot of opportunities that I wouldn't have had otherwise. If he really didn't care about me at all, he wouldn't have bothered to even send money.\n\nBio dad is walking me down the aisle because he's paying for most of my wedding. If he wasn't, I'd be getting married in a courthouse (which is fine, but I want a bigger wedding, so all parents involved want me to be able to have one). My very loving and supportive step dad understands and is okay with that because he gets the complicated dynamic, and he never felt entitled to walking me down the aisle because my bio dad is still in the picture. But I love my step dad and still gave him an important role that I actually care a lot more about. He's going to be our officiant. \n\nObviously everyone involved in my story and OPs are different so I wouldn't expect people to react the same, but the dynamics are similar enough that it speaks volumes to me that OP and her husband seem to have no understanding of their child's position, immediately reacted with anger, and that there's no mention of a role for OPs husband. Really makes me think OP is misrepresenting the relationships everyone has with her daughter. \n\nHonestly, all of the parents in this sound like they suck to me. Not the daughter, though.

OP's description of her own emotional abuse of her daughter is a confession.", "This is where your ex has the advantage. Because he is absent for the day to day and then gets to swoop in and play hero when his baby girl needs him. He gives her a little of his time and then goes about his day doing his own shit. He's present just enough to play hero. Then he's free to go about his life. Step dad was with her everyday. He loves football. He's had to be the parent and the disciplinarian. Bio dad gets to be the fun guy who buys her shit. Step dad had to make sure she did her homework.

She is well within her rights to never want to be in the same vicinity as her abuser, she is not an AH for not going.\n\nThis is just a big ol mess. My dad bribed my brothers with material things and it worked. Both my parents were abusive though so it was a bit easier to excuse their behavior in choosing the parent with money.\n\nI feel for the stepdad, it sounds like he is a good guy who raised her. I'm sure that really hurts, and that's okay, I would feel hurt too.\n\nNTA OP but maybe sit down when you both have cooled off and listen to why she wants her dad. Once you listen to her, and I mean listen, don't think about rebuttals, just let her tell you.\n\nThen ask the same from her, calmly tell your side, how it makes you feel to have your abuser there.\n\nI hope you both can work this out.

Let\u2019s discuss this then. First, it\u2019s merely her accusation of him emotionally abusing her yet, It\u2019s an all out confession of her own behavior that she emotionally abused her daughter by saying those cruel things to her. She\u2019s an emotional abuser too. Cut and dried. So she\u2019s not much better any better him by her own admission. \n\nSecond, this is the BRIDE\u2019s wedding day. It\u2019s not the time or the place for her mother\u2019s emotional trauma or feelings to get involved. Assuming her ex was truly an emotional abuser to her, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that the bride is choosing to involve him in her life and her wedding. The bride is choosing to let the last be in the past and move forward. The mother should be doing the same for her daughter\u2019s sake at the very least for her wedding day. She should be respecting her daughter\u2019s wishes, not only  as her daughter is a competent adult but as as the bride.  This is the bride and groom\u2019s wedding not hers. Even if mom doesn\u2019t like it or agree with it. \n\nThird, I get that her step dad is feeling hurt since her more or less raised her and loves her as his own. This would truly be a hit for him. It\u2019s valid and understandable. But instead of lashing out, he simply took the high road and removed himself from the situation to calm down. I also get that trauma from abuse is not easily healed or moved past. But I\u2019d be willing to wager that if she doesn\u2019t show up at her daughter\u2019s wedding, be respectful and appropriate, and be tolerant to her ex\u2019s presence at the wedding she\u2019s going to cause a big rift in her relationship with her daughter. Especially if the daughter is even further hurt, stressed out and inconvenienced by having to find a new wedding dress on short notice. Which depending on how \u201csoon\u201d the wedding is, could be next to impossible for her. Not to mention emotionally traumatizing to her when she wanted to wear her mother\u2019s dress.", "The thing is and I can understand how difficult it may be to verbalize abuse, especially to a highly critical audience, but if all we have to go on is \"he made me cry\", just about everybody in any relationship is an emotionally abusive. Arguments have a tendency to end in tears on one or both sides.", "From the OP:\n\n>My husband looked heartbroken and went out the house and told me he was going to the bar.\n\nYeah, I'm just going to assume that the guy who deals with not getting what he wants by going out and drinking wasn't the world's best step-dad.", "Im betting cosmetic, if its any kind of surgery for quality of life why wouldnt the mother help? If it was a nose job or something she probably got told to pay it for herself than asked her bio dad to do it. May be wrong but seems like the most likely answer.", "If it was that easy to figure out then why would a wedding be any harder?", "I love this.", "Yeah and she\u2019s holding the dress over her head. OPs attitude is gross.", "Saying \u201cI\u2019m not going to your wedding because you chose your absent father over the people that actually raised you,\u201d isn\u2019t abuse. \n\nSecond, I don\u2019t give a flying flippity fuck WHOSE day it is. You should not be inviting your parent\u2019s abuser to events. \n\nFinally, she\u2019s not entitled to the dress. And OP\u2019s husband isn\u2019t entitled to walk down the aisle. But saying OP is an asshole because she doesn\u2019t want to give her daughter her dress anymore, after her daughter made it obvious that her absent father\u2019s presence is more important than her mother is odd. He was an absent father. Phone calls and gifts won\u2019t change the fact that he rarely showed up for her. People are allowed to have their feelings. But that doesn\u2019t mean their feelings are reasonable.", "Lmao that\u2019s a completely baseless assumption", "Agreed. It sounds like he abused the mom and regularly made Mia cry by missing her birthdays and special events and then just threw money at her to shut her up.

This isn't so uncommon and it is fairly reasonable.\n\nAs a kid who has divorced parents, there are plenty of opportunities to choose who you want to be with. It's just life, don't convince yourself you can have both at once.", "OP framed it as he \u201cmade her cry\u201d - that doesn\u2019t mean he actually did anything wrong.

Ultimatums are a form of manipulation. This is manipulative to try to get her daughter to conform to her demands.  Manipulation is a form of emotional abuse. The terminology that goes with manipulation is domestic abuse and emotional abuse. \n\nSaying \u201cI\u2019m not going to you wedding if you invite him because I\u2019m not comfortable being around him\u201d is settling a boundary.  That would have been far more appropriate and justifiable. But that\u2019s not what mom did . No she instantly became enraged and demanded her own way and took everything important to her daughter that pertains to mom away from her if daughter did not comply.  \n\nShe and the bride had apparently already worked out an agreement that the daughter would be wearing her mother\u2019s dress. So yes, via permission and blessing for her mother she was entitled to it, and even planned in it. Now, being that it takes 9 months or more these days to order a wedding dress and a few months more for fittings, it\u2019s not unreasonable or uncommon to buy a wedding dress about a year in advance.  Just went through the process with my own daughter. The days of going and buying off the rack brand new is pretty much a thing of the past. So taking away her right to wear her dress in which she had previously given her blessing to wear is emotionally abusive. Especially if the bride is the emotional and sentimental type. \n\nMom is punishing daughter because she is trying to have some sort of relationship with her bio father.  And why isn\u2019t mom willing to compromise? I mean she moved on, remarried. They\u2019ve been separated for 14 years. If she\u2019s so traumatized from the abuse she endured, then perhaps she should seek counseling. The daughter has the right to choose her guests. She also had the right to choose what roles they play. \n \nDaughter never said dad\u2019s presence was more important. She set her own boundaries and pushed back against her mother\u2019s unfair manipulation. She said \u201cFine, don\u2019t come then\u201d. SHE was respecting her mothers wishes. It seems Mom\u2019s just upset her manipulation backfired.  \n\nAlso are we overlooking the fact that OP\u2019s original post says she regretted immediately?

You can pretty much twist the worst parts of any relationship and make it sound like one-sided abuse. For all we know the OP was the abusive one, not accusing them of it, but I'm getting more vibes of resentment towards the biodad than fear/discomfort.\n\nWhat we know of stepdad is that he is the kind of person to get angry and go out drinking when he doesn't get his way, and it sounds like potentially he's quite emotionally manipulative. \n\nWe also know that Mia feels he only cares about football, and it sounds like he hasn't been financially or emotionally supportive of her.\n\nAnd we know that Mia is coming up to one of the most important days of her life and her mother has threatened to not attend or lend her wedding dress (I'm assuming she offered) because of a perceived slight to her partner.", "not at all true. 22 is still young. the brain doesn\u2019t even stop developing until 25, let alone sorting through trauma and working through complex feelings. it\u2019s very murky waters to tread especially with the bio father still in her life and i\u2019m assuming without therapy", "OP starts off telling us hes a narc, was absent, missed milestones while he was \"traveling tbe world\" and only sent money as if he had zero relationship with the daughter, then backtracks in the comments and says he was absolutely involved, and even if he wasnt physically present hes always been emotionally present and available for his kid.  Not only do moms claims that HE and he alone was the abuser and the issue have less weight with OP herself has shown us classic blame shifting, but dealing with shitty exes at mahor events for your kids is part of the parenting deal. Is the daughter *entitled* to anything from mom? No.  Does it make her a shitty parent to withhold from her daughter over her own grudges and becuase shes choosing to side with her husband over her child? Absolutely.", "But she turned around and emotionally abused Mia. I wonder if that\u2019s the first time that\u2019s happened.

From reading the post I get the feeling OP is the real emotional abuser.", "Yeah my mom is my abuser. She physically, mentally, and sexually abused me. I haven't spoken to her in 14 years, my kids have had restraining orders against her for the last few. I ran away a few months after my 16th birthday because that morning she woke me up to the news she had breast cancer and it was serious and rare. To a few months later realizing she didn't, never had, and she was saying that because my grandma was back in town for the weekend and was throwing me a party (which I canceled because mom \"had\" cancer). I confronted her, got the confirmation I needed, socked her, grabbed my bag and left. \n\nShe reentered my life after she found out I was pregnant and if I didn't give her what she wanted she'd take me to court.

She tried bullying my eldest when she worked at a drive thru coffee stand until I told my eldest the quickest way to rid of her (my mom is highly religious, only listens to country and christian, is racist, and homophobic) so I advised my then 17 year old to put on Lil Nax X's Old Town Road and gush about how amazing it is a young, black, gay man had a hit song on not only pop and rap but also COUNTRY! And that she should be excited to see Country Music becoming modernized and progressive! Then every time she showed up at my daughter work that is what my daughter did. Plus did her version of a twerk which always has me laughing my ass off. \n\nBUT I DIGRESS, even though I dealt with all that shit with my mom, I wouldn't miss one moment of my kid's lives because she was there invited or not.

That was with my therapists telling me that \"yes, that was abuse\", but I just couldn't *get it* until I was out and had distance from the situation.\n\nIt's wild what the brain does to try and justify shitty parental behavior.", "Emotional abuse is not always obvious especially to kids. Childhood trauma from emotional abuse is wild in general. If my mom told me when I was 20 that my dad was abusive I would have not believed her at all. My dad spent years talking *just bad* enough about my mom that I believed it. I spent most of my childhood blocking out and disassociating the actual bad stuff. So basically many kids suppress what is happening as a survival tactic and don\u2019t see the situation clearly until adulthood.

I ended up dissociating the whole time, at least I know I was there all day but don't remember anything but a friend had me so I know I was as safe as I could be. \n\nI really hope we get an update from OP on this. I also hope it works out.", "Do you know if you could link the post? I'm curious now", "I will try to find it."]}
