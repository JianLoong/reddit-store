She needs to go into foster care.", "NTA if you are not prepared to handle anything that comes, do not have a child. When it is an intentional pregnancy, it is critical to seriously consider all the situations you may be put through. This shows lack of care and considerstion on their part. They made a choice, now they must live with it.", "NTA for not wanting to spend your golden years caring for a teen with severe behavioral issues, but has anybody ever tried to help this kid? Has she ever seen a therapist or psychiatrist?", "NTA. You are NEVER obligated to care for someone who isn't your own child. You did not birth this child. It is up to your son to get her the help that she needs. It is his **responsibility**.", "Everyone is an AH\n\nThe child clearly needs help and no one is caring for her.

That\u2019s the lamest, most absurdly over-reaching-est ,and most deplorable attempted guilt trip ever.  Just\u2026no.

A child with these types of behavioral issues should have been in treatment. Neither of them were parents. They don't want to be bothered with their own child yet want you to assume the responsibility.  I know it hurts to turn down custody  but your gd sounds like a lot of work.", "NTA.  This is on her parents. Your granddaughter has real problems, more than just being challenging.  Her parents should  be getting her psychological help, not dumping her on you.", "NTA", "ESH. From the stuff you posted about she sounds like a teenage girl. Maybe she has depression or bi-polar disorder. Have you tried family counseling, individual therapy, or maybe sitting down and talking to her like a person. People don't go on hunger strikes or attack people unless there is something going on. Do you know they haven't been abusing her? Do you ever think that maybe being in a household where the parents are probably fighting all the time cause they stay together for the kid (worst reason to stay in a relationship) isn't a good environment to grow up in. Take some god damn responsibility for your son's and his ex's incompetence at taking care of their child.\n\nBTW her going off to find her friends then forgetting to tell you isn't mean. Going into the venue and escorting her is weird. All you had to do was drop her off and leave.", "ESH - Your son is the AH (congrats on raising him BTW), you DIL is the AH, and from the way you blame a 14 year old child,... you too are the AH.  This is a 14 year old child whose entire family is fighting over the right to abandon her.  Of course she gets in trouble and is unpleasant to be around,... she's a teenage girl for heavens sake.  Take regular teen hormones and drama then add in a dysfunctional family who doesn't give 2 shits about her.", "You're not an AH for refusing custody, but you are if you completely turn your back on this child just because she's difficult to be around. Your son and DIL should absolutely take the lead on this.

My parents didn't have the scratch so we all suffered.  She fell in with criminals eventually. She's the only girl I know who groomed herself. \n\nFinally, peace at home.\n\nYears later I took her to court to get her away from my elderly father.", "NTA, I know a 14 year old just like this. She's loved, cared for, and healthy but will not stop making her family's life miserable.

Good luck to all of you.", "NTA \n\nDo they realize that THEY ARE WHY SHE IS LIKE THIS? Bad kids don't happen in a vacuum, they happen when parents hate each other and stay together and treat each other like shit in front of kids and say things they shouldn't and hide from the spouse in various ways like drinking, gambling, video games, etc etc. They are literally WHY she is this way and COULD do something to try to salvage it but that takes lots of EFFORT, not something it sounds like they are big on.\n\nNTA for not wanting to take on the problem they created with every waking hour of their life.", "Esh.\n\nThat poor kid.

I wouldn't send any child or grandchild of mine to foster care if I could prevent it.  I would agree to take custody and give the girl a chance.  Perhaps her parent&/ dysfunctional marriage has contributed to her problems?  Teenage years are tough even with capable parenting.", "How can you be anything other than NTA when her own parents don't want to take her full time. Is she this way because she is spoiled and wasn't taught any rules or are there possibly mental issues that have been undiagnosed? If the latter, why did no one try to get her help?

They can get het to treatment and even special care if it is necessary.", "Blaming the grandparent is a bit of a reach.
