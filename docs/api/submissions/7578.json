Your ex is being controlling and demanding.\n\nIt's what your DAUGHTER wants and likes.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is at the age where she wants to explore and try new things. Most kids at that age are having fun dying their hair. If she likes it and it looks good then what's the harm?", "LMAO No, you are NTA. You are not only not required to share the opinion of your Ex, you are doing well in supporting your daughter. Keep it up and tell your Ex that she does not have any authority over your opinion of your daughter's hair.", "NTA but IMO it\u2019s important to have open coparenting communications and showing a united front as much as possible. Maybe you could\u2019ve given your ex a heads up that the hair is not as outrageous as you were expecting and you actually like it. I\u2019m sure the ex would flip out on you but at least it doesn\u2019t put the kids in the middle. \n\nFor the record I had the same intense conversations with my ex about my 14 yo a few years ago and my now 16 yo regularly has her mom take her to add color. Sometimes it just takes time to come around. It\u2019s shocking as a parent when you child wants an unnatural hair color but in the big picture it really doesn\u2019t matter at all.", "NTA. Enabling your daughter to...develop her independence? Explore her interests and self-expression? \n\nYeah, that's called being a supportive parent. Keep it up.", "NTA What's really wrong with blue hair, though?", "NTA  you dont have to do everything your ex wants and your daughter is 14 and wants to explore different hair colors so be it..a lot worse things she could be doing", "NTA- setting aside your daughter's age and the fact she deserves to feel a sense of bodily autonomy, if she didn't change her mind while she was with your ex why would she when she's with you? Expecting you to be the enforcer to her \"authority\" is not good co-parenting.", "NTA, maybe in the future don't say you'll try until you see how it looks. But you did nothing wrong here.", "NTA.  My daughter wanted to dye her hair neon pink.  I let her.  Did your ex LET your daughter dye her hair?  If so, then she has no room to talk.  You don't need to \"get her to dye it back\" if it looks cute.  She'll grow out of that phase.  Mine did.  It took a year though.", "NTA. Is there any other reason why your ex-wife didnt like the hair dyed blue other than her own preference and taking it as an abuse of her authority?\n\nIdk, where I am, until university, hell, I was a post graduate student, we aren't allowed to dye our hair any unnatural color. Can there be a similar reason such as this?\n\nIf there is, then you can help explain why she needs to get her hair colored to something more subdued so she won't get trouble in school. You don't have to lie and say it's ugly but there might be some compromise needed (like keeping it to natural colors during school season) and being allowed to experiment with color on vacations.\n\nIf there isn't and it's just your ex wife feeling the need to control her life, then hell no. I say, be the parent that lets her child make her own decisions within reason because if your ex-wife goes this gaga over hair color, who knows how she goes crazy over anything else that doesn't go her way.", "NTA. If you were just saying it to spite your ex, then yeah. \n\nBut if your daughter likes her hair, and you also genuinely like it, then what exactly is the problem? \n\nYou've done nothing wrong, when it comes down to trivial things like hair colour, supporting your kid is the best decision, no point pushing back for the sake of pushing back.", "NTA, but you should have had a convo with your ex before your daughter went back to stay with her. It's worse for her to hear a comment like that from your daughter than a convo about it with you.", "In a very soft way, YTA; and I only say that because you missed the very simple \"but\" in there.\n\n\"Your hair looks cute *but your mother is upset that you did this without discussing it with her first*.\" \n\nYou would have been able to uphold what you told your ex without being mean or cruel to your daughter.", "NTA.

The more effort made to control a child's inconsequential and personal choices for things as mundane as personal style and hobbies, the less inconsequential and mundane their future choices will be. My kid has had colored hair since she was 4. She had pink hair (over her natural color, no bleach) and recently has tested colors from forest green to aquamarine (including the teal and turquoise in between.) It chafes some people to see children expressing themselves but if we don't allow it and control too hard, they're going to be more extreme and unruly about their choices later. \n\nI hope your daughter likes her hair and your ex unpuckers her soul's sphincter to allow joy when no one is harmed by the situation.", "INFO do you think your daughter may have issues with her mates or school because of her hairs? Around me it's totally \"meh\" and would definite NTA but if your environment is different you should be making her understand that there may be a price to pay for her experiments.", "NTA. Hair grows out. Learned with my teenagers, to pick the battles that are important. Hair color is not.", "YTA, not for saying your daughters hair looked cute, but yes it is an asshole move to say you\u2019ll do one thing then do another, and then let her find out that you did the opposite of what you said from your daughter instead of telling her yourself. Just not a good co-parenting move", "my daughter had blue hair for a long time, it\u2019s even blue in her senior class pictures.

In my school we were excluded for dying our hair. Just wondering if that's why her mum is pissed?\n\n I don't think you're TA but it wasn't the best co parenting move to go against her other parent, you all are supposed to be working together and at least pretending to present a united front.", "Also a neon blue is hardly outrageous its not like its multicolored like a rainbow", "This right here! What\u2019s the harm! You kid is doing something that has almost no draw backs. She ain\u2019t doing nothing illegal. That blue hair won\u2019t last forever. Let her be a kid! Other wise she might rebel because y\u2019all be controlling too much!\n\nHowever, the discourse between you and your ex doesn\u2019t paint you in a good picture either. You told your ex \u201cI would try\u201d to talk her out of the blue hair. Being a united front is important when raising a kid. Undermining the other parent can lead to unhealthy relationships between all 3 people involved. This situation between y\u2019all is a real delicate pickle if I might say. I vote OP is not the AH!", "Exactly what I thought too. SO MANY worse things. Don't ask me how I know. lol", "Except that this is hair color. She\u2019s not dropping out to hitchhike across the country, she dyed her hair.", "This precisely", "Because a 14-year-old who temporarily dyes her hair blue is automatically going to become a hardened criminal and drug abuser, and we need to make sure that all kids view their bodies and themselves as parental property and follow parental orders without question, because it's more important they look \"responsible\" (whatever that means) and obey unquestioningly than that they ever develop any independent sense of self or grow to believe in themselves as separate human beings and not their parents' little dolly for dress-up time.", "Her school is pretty relaxed when it comes to uniform/appearance. I've seen plenty of girls at her school with red and pink hair whenever I pick her up.", "Can I ask why you think she shouldn't dye her hair blue? I don't see anything wrong with it.", "Which is fine, and I agree, but one of the things that should happen during co-parenting is discussion and agreement or compromise when it comes to their children, not one parent telling the other parent to fuck off. So really, it doesn't have anything to do with a 14-year-old body autonomy, but more about Reddit supporting those who stray from traditional values the most.  And somebody coming to this sub and seeking judgment on following current popular trends, especially those that shun traditional values, is like a Hollywood actress walking down the red carpet and asking her fans if they think her dress looks nice.  Just seeking validation from an echo chamber.\n\nEdit: for clarification of point, said actress could be wearing a dirty dress made out of burlap, and she would still receive compliments and praise from her like-minded fans.", "It's neon blue... She can become a bully target, teachers can start treating her differently (not that they should), hair dye affects the optical nerves, she is more exposed to potential predators since she stands out from the crowd, gives the more mature / independent vine, and clearly doesn't have anyone to talk sense into her... Sorry but the society we live in is still unevolved and there are many things that should not happen that happen...", "I once had a co-worker give me a hard time because I told her son I liked his green hair. OP should tell his ex the same thing I told the co-worker - if dyeing their hair a weird color is the worst thing your child does, you shouldn't complain. This is definitely a \"pick your battles\" situation and not worth fighting over.", "NTA it\u2019s HAIR.  If your kid gets a kick out of changing her hair, which grows out, you won at the parenting lottery.  What better thing to use to rebel than something that self corrects in a matter of months, and is not harmful or dangerous?????", "NTA good job supporting your daughters choice!", "When people would say things to my mom like \"wow, I'm surprised you let your daughter do that!\" in regards to me dying my hair all kinds of wacky colors at 15, 16yrs old shed flatly respond, \"It's hair. She's not skipping school, she's not having a child, she's not drinking alcohol. Hair grows back and she's a good kid.\"\n\nUsually shut people up pretty quick because yeah, hair is pretty trivial in the grand scheme of things (and those folks were questioning my mom's parenting by making comments, so...)\n\nLet your daughter do her own thing. She'll be more likely to be respectful if she feels respected.", "NTA", "NTA why would you lie about something like this lol", "NAH. You might want a sit down conversation with your daughter about the health of her hair and that home dye kids can be very harsh and harmful to her hair. You and her mom would appreciate it if she did research into better products that could be used.  Does she have shampoo and conditioner specifically for dyed hair?", "YTA. You should not have agreed with the ex in the first place.", "Exactly! And what better time to express yourself with colourful hair than in your teens? She is an adult soon enough and in some jobs you are not really able to dye your hair blue, purple, pink or any bright colour. Now is the time to do it without any consequences (except a whiny mom) or second thoughts.\n\nETA: the colours will fade. But the support of her parent will stay.", "This happened to me. When my daughter was 14 she dyed her hair magenta. I called my mom all freaked out:\n\nMom: Is she pregnant?\nMe: No\nMom: Is she using drugs?\nMe: No\nMom: Is she using alcohol?\nMe: No\nMom: How are her grades?\nMe: All A\u2019s\nMom: She\u2019s a great kid and she\u2019s a teenager. Exploring their sense of self is what teenagers do. I recommend counting your blessings that you have such a great kid and learn to pick your battles. This is not a hill to die on. \nMe: Damn mom, when did you become such a wise woman? \n\nYep, when it comes to teens pick your battles wisely.\n\nETA: I apologize my formatting sucks.", "This!!!!  Teens need to explore their individuality and should do it now before they have to conform for work.  My daughter tried several hair colors when she was a teen, luckily I was a hair stylist and did the lightening and coloring properly so her hair didn't get damaged.  She also wanted to get ear and nose piercings when she was 16, I let her, piercings can be taken out.", "You say that, but I\u2019m 46 and I still have blue hair. Bottom line - it\u2019s just hair. Her mother needs to let her have fun and express herself. It\u2019s not permanent, it causes no harm. There are far worse things she could be doing that can actually do physical and psychological damage.", "Agree!!  Fist bumps for your blue hair.  You're absolutely right.  Far worse things to worry about.", "Well thought out argument, I'm sure. You truly sound like a 14 year old yourself with your poinant tirade.  I'm not arguing against hair dye.  Blue or green or purple or rainbow or whatever is fine, so long as the parents of a 14 year old come to some type of agreement.  My position is against the lack of co-parenting and the lack of respect within that is the problem.  Despite what your army believes, parenting should be nuclear as much as possible.  It is the responsibility of the parents to raise their kid as they see fit, but when parents fail to co-parent, then it becomes a progressive free for all.  The dissolving of the nuclear family is a huge part of the world's problems today.  Oh, and if you don't know what \"responsible\" looks like, feel free to Google that.  It's not a hard concept for the above-averate 14 year old to grasp.", "But again, that\u2019s a false equivalency. My only beef with this poster is saying he\u2019d try to get her to dye it back. He should have presented his position - he\u2019s allowed to have one. This doesn\u2019t exactly sound like a positive co-parenting situation, but as a parent, non-traditional hair color would generally not be a hill I would die on (no pun intended). If they blow up over blue hair, it was a flawed co-parenting relationship from the outset.", "Btw, I work in the prison system, and 99.99% of the \"guests\" have natural color hair... so, your inane comment about hair color being associated with being a hardened criminal just shows itself to be inane and emotion-fueled without much thought.", "I don't think this is a false equivalency at all.  And it's not just that he should have presented his position. He should have been \"allowed\" to present his position before the hair was dyed in the first place. She's 14 and, in spite of what modern trash culture thinks, her scope of body autonomy should be limited.  I do agree that there are co-parenting situation sucks. But my point here, in this thread, is not really focused on the efficacy of their co-parenting, but on the OP posting for judgment in this sub when OP knows exactly the judgment that she will receive.  OP is not seeking judgment, but validation.  And my response also touched on all the various comments on authority and body autonomy and all those other catch phrases, which are always the cool catch phrases in the context of being anti-traditionalists.  And I also find a noteworthy that so many of the comments sound almost like a copy/paste of each other.  It's like people have to read what everybody else says before they make their own post, just to make sure that it sits in line with the majority.  But I digress.  Oh, and per the purpose of this sub, OP, YTA, not for thinking it's cute, but for having shitty co-parenting skills, then coming here and seeking validation, where you know it will be showered upon you. Children of divorced parents shouldn't be used as a score board."]}
