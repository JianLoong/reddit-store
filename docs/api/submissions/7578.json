Most kids at that age are having fun dying their hair. If she likes it and it looks good then what's the harm?", "LMAO No, you are NTA. You are not only not required to share the opinion of your Ex, you are doing well in supporting your daughter. Keep it up and tell your Ex that she does not have any authority over your opinion of your daughter's hair.", "NTA but IMO it\u2019s important to have open coparenting communications and showing a united front as much as possible. Maybe you could\u2019ve given your ex a heads up that the hair is not as outrageous as you were expecting and you actually like it. I\u2019m sure the ex would flip out on you but at least it doesn\u2019t put the kids in the middle. \n\nFor the record I had the same intense conversations with my ex about my 14 yo a few years ago and my now 16 yo regularly has her mom take her to add color. Sometimes it just takes time to come around. It\u2019s shocking as a parent when you child wants an unnatural hair color but in the big picture it really doesn\u2019t matter at all.", "NTA.

My daughter wanted to dye her hair neon pink.  I let her.  Did your ex LET your daughter dye her hair?  If so, then she has no room to talk.

Is there any other reason why your ex-wife didnt like the hair dyed blue other than her own preference and taking it as an abuse of her authority?\n\nIdk, where I am, until university, hell, I was a post graduate student, we aren't allowed to dye our hair any unnatural color. Can there be a similar reason such as this?\n\nIf there is, then you can help explain why she needs to get her hair colored to something more subdued so she won't get trouble in school. You don't have to lie and say it's ugly but there might be some compromise needed (like keeping it to natural colors during school season) and being allowed to experiment with color on vacations.\n\nIf there isn't and it's just your ex wife feeling the need to control her life, then hell no.

If you were just saying it to spite your ex, then yeah. \n\nBut if your daughter likes her hair, and you also genuinely like it, then what exactly is the problem? \n\nYou've done nothing wrong, when it comes down to trivial things like hair colour, supporting your kid is the best decision, no point pushing back for the sake of pushing back.", "NTA, but you should have had a convo with your ex before your daughter went back to stay with her.

Far worse things to worry about.", "Well thought out argument, I'm sure. You truly sound like a 14 year old yourself with your poinant tirade.  I'm not arguing against hair dye.  Blue or green or purple or rainbow or whatever is fine, so long as the parents of a 14 year old come to some type of agreement.  My position is against the lack of co-parenting and the lack of respect within that is the problem.  Despite what your army believes, parenting should be nuclear as much as possible.  It is the responsibility of the parents to raise their kid as they see fit, but when parents fail to co-parent, then it becomes a progressive free for all.  The dissolving of the nuclear family is a huge part of the world's problems today.  Oh, and if you don't know what \"responsible\" looks like, feel free to Google that.  It's not a hard concept for the above-averate 14 year old to grasp.", "But again, that\u2019s a false equivalency. My only beef with this poster is saying he\u2019d try to get her to dye it back. He should have presented his position - he\u2019s allowed to have one. This doesn\u2019t exactly sound like a positive co-parenting situation, but as a parent, non-traditional hair color would generally not be a hill I would die on (no pun intended). If they blow up over blue hair, it was a flawed co-parenting relationship from the outset.", "Btw, I work in the prison system, and 99.99% of the \"guests\" have natural color hair... so, your inane comment about hair color being associated with being a hardened criminal just shows itself to be inane and emotion-fueled without much thought.", "I don't think this is a false equivalency at all.  And it's not just that he should have presented his position. He should have been \"allowed\" to present his position before the hair was dyed in the first place. She's 14 and, in spite of what modern trash culture thinks, her scope of body autonomy should be limited.  I do agree that there are co-parenting situation sucks. But my point here, in this thread, is not really focused on the efficacy of their co-parenting, but on the OP posting for judgment in this sub when OP knows exactly the judgment that she will receive.  OP is not seeking judgment, but validation.  And my response also touched on all the various comments on authority and body autonomy and all those other catch phrases, which are always the cool catch phrases in the context of being anti-traditionalists.  And I also find a noteworthy that so many of the comments sound almost like a copy/paste of each other.  It's like people have to read what everybody else says before they make their own post, just to make sure that it sits in line with the majority.  But I digress.  Oh, and per the purpose of this sub, OP, YTA, not for thinking it's cute, but for having shitty co-parenting skills, then coming here and seeking validation, where you know it will be showered upon you.

When you aren't, inevitably your child gets conflicting information on their boundaries. I think blue hair is fine, but your ex wanted you to be a parent, not a friend. Did your daughter go behind her mom's back and dye her hair? Did your ex approve the hair color, only to change her mind later? A better response would have been, \"It's cute, but make sure you discuss things like this with us beforehand because you can really damage your hair and skin doing it yourself.\" Or, \"It's cute, but your mom is pretty upset about it and I want to hear your side of things.\" I don't feel like I have enough information to really determine if you were in the right or not. If we're looking at this in a vacuum, you did undermine your ex's authority as a parent and (perhaps unintentionally) set a precedent that even if your ex says no, your daughter can just do it anyway and dad will be fine with it. Parenting is very rarely ever black and white, and while I think your ex wife overreacted a little, I can see where she is coming from.", "NTA \n30 years ago I dyed my hair purple before it was mainstream.

It's a temporary hair color, not a permanent tattoo or inappropriately revealing clothes. Having dyed hair for a few months isn't going to permanently or significantly affect her body in any way, so what kind of parenting do the parents need to do here? It's just hair. It's not a major decision about her body that she'll be stuck with for the rest of her life and possibly come to regret in a few years. \n\n>It is the responsibility of the parents to raise their kid as they see fit, but when parents fail to co-parent, then it becomes a progressive free for all.\n\nOkay, but when one parent makes unreasonable demands or expectations, it's not on the other parent to bow to them just so they're not disagreeing about a topic. Yes, it's obviously ideal for exes to be in total agreement and co-parent as smoothly and cohesively as possible, but sometimes, if one parent is acting irrationally, it's just not possible. When that happens, it's better to be a good role model for your kid and stand up for them. \n\n>The dissolving of the nuclear family is a huge part of the world's problems today.\n\nBc the world hasn't always had problems?

It\u2019s not exactly an edgy statement anymore and is not a permanent body modification.

The great thing about differences of opinions with your ex, as in this situation, is that you get to tell your ex to stfu with zero repercussions.", "It\u2019s just hair. It will wash out. She\u2019ll grow it out, cut it off, style & restyle it. Mom needs to let this one go", "NTA, it\u2019s HAIR for heavens sake! Why do people get so upset about hair. At 14, let them express themselves. Hair (typically) grows back. I don\u2019t always like my kids\u2019 style choices (hair and clothes) but if they\u2019re happy, I\u2019m happy.", "I miss the days when I had enough hair to rock those outlandish colors.\n\nIf your daughter likes her hair, what's the harm in it? It's not like she's out drinking or drugging. Let her have this.\n\nObviously NTA!", "I'm guessing that your daughter either didn't ask before dyeing her hair or she asked and was told no.\n\nYou're NTA for saying it was cute, but you definitely should have backed up your ex on it being done to begin with. \"Your hair looks cute, but you know that dyeing your hair without asking/after being told no isn't ok. We can discuss you dyeing it in the future, but for now, we'll be scheduling an appointment to dye it back to your original color\".\n\nYour ex is right in that you probably undermined her authority on this.", "NTA\n\nHair color and style is one of the least impactful ways a person can express themselves. \n\nGood on you for letting your kid have fun with her hair. As long as it's not causing interference with school or public interactions, it's harmless. \n\nMore & more, companies have been relaxing dress codes to allow for 'unnatural' hair colors, tattoos, and piercings. It's not going to stop her from getting a job, or getting into a college, or whatever she might be thinking about doing for a living.", "NTA but I\u2019m one of those \u201chair grows back if you don\u2019t like it\u201d people so I might be a bit biased", "NTA. A 14yo should absolutely be able to explore new styles with the support of their parents in their bodily autonomy. Tbh your ex is the AH here.", "NTA. I took the potential teen authority testing right out from u Der my 14yo daughter by answering \"Sure\" when she expressed interest in dyeing her hair. Then I put highlights in it. My sister later helped her 10yo son dye his blue, which meant bleaching it first. \n\nHair grows and grows out. Piercings can be removed.", "NTA. Speaking as someone whose entire childhood consisted of fighting nonstop to have my hair how I wanted it, it probably meant a lot to your daughter to hear that you liked it.

My hair? One of them.\n\nShe's always so furious that I don't keep my \"natural blond hair\" because I'm the \"only one in the family who got to keep such a gorgeous color\". Everyone else in my family has brown hair.\n\nCool? But I'm 34. And I HATE my natural hair color. I hate it.

Not worth fighting with teens about hair and cloths.  Power struggle isn\u2019t worth it", "Shes 14. If her acts of self expression/self discovery is just some manic panic, yall should be grateful. She could be auditioning for Teen Mom or experimenting with drugs and alcohol. NTA", "You should never have agreed to gang up on your kid.\n\nBut NTA for complimenting her. Sounds like she needs someone on her side.", "In terms of hair color there are some limits to bodily autonomy for that age though. There are many schools that have hair color rules and she could have gotten suspended for that.", "Hell, my 9-yr old just coloured her hair in with highlighters.  I went to the store and bought her some semi-permanent colour to do it properly.", "I started wanting to dye my hair purple at 14. My mom wouldn\u2019t let me (and I was too much of a goody two-shoes to do it anyway), and I finally landed in a place in my career where I could do it as an adult at 27. It hasn\u2019t been a natural color since. I wouldn\u2019t count on it being a phase", " \ud83e\udd23 I remember when my son was that age and he wanted to dye his hair blue. I colored it for him, with my former MIL on the phone with us and giving us tips to make it last longer.\n\nMy ex-husband wanted our son to go back to his natural color before they went to visit my ex's parents over the Christmas break.  That man was far more interested in appearances than in substance. \n\nAs it turned out, his parents were more okay with it than he was. \n\nI always told our son that I would support any temporary changes to his appearance; but any permanent alterations for the sole purpose of ornamentation had to wait until he was 18.", "Exactly! \n\nI remember when a former coworker of mines 15 year old daughter dyed her hair bright red and neon green stripes (it looks seriously awful) and my coworker went \u201cwell at least shes not speed dating the marching band or doing drugs or drinking.

Maybe once my hair goes all white\u2026.  \n\nBut I definitely admire those with cool colors!", "Damn dude, your mom should chill a bit, you are a whole ass adult and can do what you want.", "There are newer dyes with chemicals that aren't so strong now! You could give overtone a shot, since it's supposed to be like a conditioner that deposits color in your hair. I don't know how well it works, but I do have friends who swear by it.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t about hair color, it\u2019s about your ex\u2019s need for control. Your daughter wants to express herself. She\u2019s not harming anyone. \n\nI might be a more relaxed parent, but hair color is nowhere on the list of battles with my kiddos. Never has been. My ex doesn\u2019t care about hair color. The only drastic change in appearance we talked about with our youngest was when she wanted her nose pierced for her 16th birthday.", "NTA!! Totally not. \\[I taught public high school for 31 years.\\] Daughter is at an age when she wants to stretch her legs and discover herself. Bravo! Trying out a new hair color may be the least worrying path of self discovery.", "Also so what if it doesn't look good? She's 14. Have you really lived if you haven't had at least one embarrassing hair cut/color?????? My family would say no lmao", "My mom didn\u2019t allow me to dye my hair any \u2018unnatural\u2019 colors as a teen. Now I\u2019m an adult and my hair is a different vivid color every month!", "Excellent time to do all your screw ups. Because when you screw up as an adult bad things can happen, like losing a pay, losing a SO ect ect.", "You finally got the pink hair on your avatar", "I know a few senior women with purple & blue hair, they rock! it's so cute on them", "The hair thing was the least of the issues my mom had / has with being extremely overprotective or controlling about. Bride side is I have a very funny therapist now!", "Overtone works a little too well, especially if you use it like instructed. I had to grow mine out to get rid of it, even after 3-4 months of not using it.", "Always a good bright side to have! Bless the good therapists in the world.", "My kid has been doing colorful hair since she was 12! Normally streaks till she reached 14 and wanted rainbow. Only rule her dad and I made... NO BLEACH. Mainly because her hair is fragile due to a medical condition.   \nLet them be a a kid... it is hair, it grows.  \n\n\nNTA", "When I was 20 years old, I dyed my hair bright sky blue. I wanted to get it out of my system early. It absolutely horrified and offended my mother, she wouldn't even hug me and backed away with a disgusted look on her face when I came home from college for winter break. \n\nMy dad said, \"Oh good, you look like one of Santa's elves.\" (He had a big Santa beard at the time and likes to play up the role around Christmas time.) \n\nTook my mom weeks to stop complaining about my blue hair behind my back. Eventually it faded and I dyed it back to brown. Never had the urge to a \"wild\" hair color again. \n\nI was okay with my mom having a meltdown over it. She thinks \"natural beauty\" is more beautiful than make up, fancy hair, etc. I understood she felt I was displaying to the world that she was a \"bad mom\" even though she wasn't. I wasn't offended by her being offended. \n\nAnyway, I think some parents can take these experiments personally, and some can just roll with them, knowing it doesn't define the child - they're just trying out some fashion. You didn't make your daughter feel bad for trying something out, and if it was a rebellious act, you subdued it by not being all high anxiety about it.

Kids have been doing this for decades. Yawn.\n\nWhere I work, I see middle aged people working professional jobs with purple and blue hair. No one cares.", "Yeah, NTA, but if you were only going to try and talk her into changing it back if it looked bad, then you should have set that expectation with the ex. Can see how she felt like you went back on your word, OP", "I\u2019m a guy, and I grew my hair long much to the chagrin of my very conservative parents. Well into my 20s my mom would still try and subtly guilt me into cutting my hair before I finally had to put my foot down and tell her that she better stop trying to guilt me or I\u2019d stop coming around. Needless to say that when I did eventually cut it (I just got tired of taking care of it), she was a little over enthusiastic", "Let your daughter have her fun. She's 14!

She used purple shampoo which funnily enough left a lavender hue in her hair, everyone raved about it. \n\nSince then she changes up her hair color every couple of months with wild amazing colors. She did red white and blue for July 4 (like Harley Quinn), candy corn for fall, rainbow for Pride Month etc. Most people think it's an amazing form of self-expression and strangers would give her thumbs up or lavish praise at how cool it is and wish they were bold enough to do the same. \n\nLet your daughter express herself in a harmless fun way, denying her bodily autonomy would send her very damaging message and she could Rebel in more damaging and permanent ways. I did at her age and still have some regrets over it some 15 years later.", "Not related, but I remember when I would stay overnight at my gramma's in elementary, I would use her purple shampoo (she had silver/grey hair) and since it also said blonde on the bottle, I thought that if I washed it enough times, I would wake up with blonde hair. I'm a dark haired Hispanic btw lol"]}
