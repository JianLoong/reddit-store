I said that I'll try. And I meant it because I thought that her hair would be horrible. But when she came to stay with me and asked me if I liked her new colour I said that it looked cute.

Your ex is being controlling and demanding.\n\nIt's what your DAUGHTER wants and likes.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is at the age where she wants to explore and try new things. Most kids at that age are having fun dying their hair. If she likes it and it looks good then what's the harm?", "LMAO No, you are NTA. You are not only not required to share the opinion of your Ex, you are doing well in supporting your daughter. Keep it up and tell your Ex that she does not have any authority over your opinion of your daughter's hair.", "NTA but IMO it\u2019s important to have open coparenting communications and showing a united front as much as possible. Maybe you could\u2019ve given your ex a heads up that the hair is not as outrageous as you were expecting and you actually like it. I\u2019m sure the ex would flip out on you but at least it doesn\u2019t put the kids in the middle. \n\nFor the record I had the same intense conversations with my ex about my 14 yo a few years ago and my now 16 yo regularly has her mom take her to add color. Sometimes it just takes time to come around. It\u2019s shocking as a parent when you child wants an unnatural hair color but in the big picture it really doesn\u2019t matter at all.", "NTA. Enabling your daughter to...develop her independence? Explore her interests and self-expression? \n\nYeah, that's called being a supportive parent. Keep it up.", "NTA What's really wrong with blue hair, though?", "NTA  you dont have to do everything your ex wants and your daughter is 14 and wants to explore different hair colors so be it..a lot worse things she could be doing", "NTA- setting aside your daughter's age and the fact she deserves to feel a sense of bodily autonomy, if she didn't change her mind while she was with your ex why would she when she's with you? Expecting you to be the enforcer to her \"authority\" is not good co-parenting.", "NTA, maybe in the future don't say you'll try until you see how it looks. But you did nothing wrong here.", "NTA.  My daughter wanted to dye her hair neon pink.  I let her.  Did your ex LET your daughter dye her hair?  If so, then she has no room to talk.  You don't need to \"get her to dye it back\" if it looks cute.  She'll grow out of that phase.  Mine did.  It took a year though.", "NTA. Is there any other reason why your ex-wife didnt like the hair dyed blue other than her own preference and taking it as an abuse of her authority?\n\nIdk, where I am, until university, hell, I was a post graduate student, we aren't allowed to dye our hair any unnatural color. Can there be a similar reason such as this?\n\nIf there is, then you can help explain why she needs to get her hair colored to something more subdued so she won't get trouble in school. You don't have to lie and say it's ugly but there might be some compromise needed (like keeping it to natural colors during school season) and being allowed to experiment with color on vacations.\n\nIf there isn't and it's just your ex wife feeling the need to control her life, then hell no. I say, be the parent that lets her child make her own decisions within reason because if your ex-wife goes this gaga over hair color, who knows how she goes crazy over anything else that doesn't go her way.", "NTA. If you were just saying it to spite your ex, then yeah. \n\nBut if your daughter likes her hair, and you also genuinely like it, then what exactly is the problem? \n\nYou've done nothing wrong, when it comes down to trivial things like hair colour, supporting your kid is the best decision, no point pushing back for the sake of pushing back.", "NTA, but you should have had a convo with your ex before your daughter went back to stay with her. It's worse for her to hear a comment like that from your daughter than a convo about it with you.", "In a very soft way, YTA; and I only say that because you missed the very simple \"but\" in there.\n\n\"Your hair looks cute *but your mother is upset that you did this without discussing it with her first*.\" \n\nYou would have been able to uphold what you told your ex without being mean or cruel to your daughter.", "NTA. If this is the worst thing a teen girl does, praise the lord. I believe you that it\u2019s adorable. My brother had to get an alarm system to keep the teen girls in!", "Not even close. NTA.\n\nYou probably made your daughters day after having to hear their mom bitch all day. I wouldn\u2019t even worry about it just keep doing what you\u2019re doing.", "Nta... but...\n\n\"Hey, so mom wants me to ask you to dye it back to normal.   I really don't care, i think it looks good.  Do what you want with that.\"\n\nYou did what you were asked, you didn't lie, you threw unreasonable mom under the bus, and you let her know that you approve.     Win. \ud83d\ude01", "NTA.  Unless it's truly tragic (patchy, bleeding and staining things, breaking off) and needs professional correction or a haircut to deal with, your ex needs to let it go.  Why does her AUTHORITAAAAAH overrule yours?", "NTA  \n\n\nShe's your ex for a reason. I'm assuming \"incompatible outlooks on what is and is not appropriate\" was one of those core reasons.  \n\n\nYour daughter has blue hair. Your ex can get over it, or die mad about it.", "NTA - when she's at your house, your ex has no authority.

Your daughter will love you more for allowing her to explore her creativity", "I love posts like this.  \"Hey Reddit, is it okay for me to let my barely teenaged daughter do what she wants?

The more effort made to control a child's inconsequential and personal choices for things as mundane as personal style and hobbies, the less inconsequential and mundane their future choices will be. My kid has had colored hair since she was 4. She had pink hair (over her natural color, no bleach) and recently has tested colors from forest green to aquamarine (including the teal and turquoise in between.) It chafes some people to see children expressing themselves but if we don't allow it and control too hard, they're going to be more extreme and unruly about their choices later. \n\nI hope your daughter likes her hair and your ex unpuckers her soul's sphincter to allow joy when no one is harmed by the situation.", "INFO do you think your daughter may have issues with her mates or school because of her hairs? Around me it's totally \"meh\" and would definite NTA but if your environment is different you should be making her understand that there may be a price to pay for her experiments.", "NTA. Hair grows out. Learned with my teenagers, to pick the battles that are important. Hair color is not.", "YTA, not for saying your daughters hair looked cute, but yes it is an asshole move to say you\u2019ll do one thing then do another, and then let her find out that you did the opposite of what you said from your daughter instead of telling her yourself. Just not a good co-parenting move", "my daughter had blue hair for a long time, it\u2019s even blue in her senior class pictures. The value it added to her self esteem was worth any angst I may have felt in the beginning. \n\nNTA and tell your ex to stop being one.", "NTA. It\u2019s hair. It\u2019s not permanent. You said in a comment it won\u2019t be a problem at school. She\u2019s old enough to make that type of decision about her own body.", "You're daughter is 14 and has neon blue hair.\n\nYou're not protecting your daughter, you're counter parenting your wife. \n\nYta sorry\n\nUnless you state to the 14 adolescent that it's cute and then explain all the reasons why she should not dye her hair such an unnatural colour at 14, yta.\n\nAnd I'm speaking from the perspective of a 31f who at 14 had her hair bright red", "Will this affect her going to school? In my school we were excluded for dying our hair. Just wondering if that's why her mum is pissed?\n\n I don't think you're TA but it wasn't the best co parenting move to go against her other parent, you all are supposed to be working together and at least pretending to present a united front.", "Also a moon blue is hardly outrageous ots not like its multicolored like a rainbow", "This right here! What\u2019s the harm! You kid is doing something that has almost no draw backs. She ain\u2019t doing nothing illegal. That blue hair won\u2019t last forever. Let her be a kid! Other wise she might rebel because y\u2019all be controlling too much!\n\nHowever, the discourse between you and your ex doesn\u2019t paint you in a good picture either. You told your ex \u201cI would try\u201d to talk her out of the blue hair. Being a united front is important when raising a kid. Undermining the other parent can lead to unhealthy relationships between all 3 people involved. This situation between y\u2019all is a real delicate pickle if I might say. I vote OP is not the AH!", "Exactly what I thought too. SO MANY worse things. Don't ask me how I know. lol", "Except that this is hair color. She\u2019s not dropping out to hitchhike across the country, she dyed her hair.", "This precisely", "Because a 14-year-old who temporarily dyes her hair blue is automatically going to become a hardened criminal and drug abuser, and we need to make sure that all kids view their bodies and themselves as parental property and follow parental orders without question, because it's more important they look \"responsible\" (whatever that means) and obey unquestioningly than that they ever develop any independent sense of self or grow to believe in themselves as separate human beings and not their parents' little dolly for dress-up time.", "Her school is pretty relaxed when it comes to uniform/appearance. I've seen plenty of girls at her school with red and pink hair whenever I pick her up.", "Can I ask why you think she shouldn't dye her hair blue? I don't see anything wrong with it.", "Which is fine, and I agree, but one of the things that should happen during co-parenting is discussion and agreement or compromise when it comes to their children, not one parent telling the other parent to fuck off. So really, it doesn't have anything to do with a 14-year-old body autonomy, but more about Reddit supporting those who stray from traditional values the most.  And somebody coming to this sub and seeking judgment on following current popular trends, especially those that shun traditional values, is like a Hollywood actress walking down the red carpet and asking her fans if they think her dress looks nice.  Just seeking validation from an echo chamber.\n\nEdit: for clarification of point, said actress could be wearing a dirty dress made out of burlap, and she would still receive compliments and praise from her like-minded fans.", "It's neon blue... She can become a bully target, teachers can start treating her differently (not that they should), hair dye affects the optical nerves, she is more exposed to potential predators since she stands out from the crowd, gives the more mature / independent vine, and clearly doesn't have anyone to talk sense into her... Sorry but the society we live in is still unevolved and there are many things that should not happen that happen..."]}
