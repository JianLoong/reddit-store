Yeah this sounds like one of those insanely narcissistic parents.

It's your birthday and you should be able to pick where you want but you handled the situation pretty badly in regards to actually telling your own mom you didn't even want any of them to be there and then mentioning that now she wasn't getting you a gift.   A lot of disfunction in your family all around.", "NTA. You already had plans, it's your birthday, you pick the restaurant. \n\nI am also difficult with food.

If someone announced that they can\u2019t eat anything at all there, it\u2019s probably not about the food at all but about wanting to be the center of attention and getting off on playing the \u201cvictim\u201d.

I'd give your BF a pass, he was trying to be nice guy by inviting them. Likely his family behaves with more finesse.\n\nAnother point is it's important to show your boundaries now. Should you ever want to get married, gentle but firm boundaries now should demonstrate to your family that they can't pull the strings. It wouldn't hurt to start saving your money for the event YOU want.", "YTA - your family wants to spend time with you on your birthday; you could attempt to not be a selfish little piggy and take the \u201cit\u2019s my birthday I\u2019ll cry if I want\u201d approach.", "NTA.

Went on a trip recently-ish with my boyfriend for a convention and the group went out to eat at a restaurant I was unfamiliar with, there turned out to not be anything on the menu I could eat (I have texture issues with a lot of foods), so I just sat and talked with everyone rather than throw a fit about the choice of restaurant.\n\nYou know.

I know for me it\u2019s trying something new-ish, since my parents always pushed me to try new foods and expand my pallete.", "That's so wholesome :)", "It really was! They both did it in their own way so it created someone (me) who is (for the most part) not afraid to stick something in their mouth. It has created some weird problems, like my ex who had to wait on my subway order, and my current partner who is the pickiest of eaters but cannot recognize that fact. But, I enjoy my meals and when I ca I experiment heavily in the kitchen, and I hope my step-daughter can learn from it."]}
