You did more than enough for them. Also, the fact that your mother treated you like that and withheld a gift from you just means you didn't fall into her manipulation. \n\nIt sucks she won't give you anything, but it's better to get a gift from someone who cares about you than one who will likely use it against you.", "NTA. There's one cuisine I'm not a fan of, one, I will eat anywhere else. We had that cuisine on my birthday multiple times growing up because it was my dads favourite, I literally don't eat it, good for you choosing to go to places you enjoy for your birthday.", "NTA OP.

Bf had good intentions but should have known Moroccan food isn't gonna work for everyone.", "You didn\u2019t put your age but from what I red, you were willing to pay when it was just you and your boyfriend, you included them to be nice but now they are trying to take control of the outing and choose the restaurant so no. \nI am not sold on the part where you asked them to pay for the restaurant because if they are not willing to come and enjoy it with you or suck it up so you can enjoy, it is only logical they are not going to pay and it feels entitled on your part.\nSo I\u2019d say NTA (because they suck more than you) and frankly your mother little remark about \u00ab\u00a0a normal restaurant\u00a0\u00bb is ignorant at best.", "Time for a new boyfriend.", "NAH Yes you should be able to have the birthday dinner you want but I\u2019m willing to bet that you already knew your family did not like \u201cweird\u201d restaurants but you invited them anyway.

We got to pick our restaurant, we never went out, ever.

If they want to have a dinner with you then they can see you another day, or not at all. They sound racist and toxic asf.", "Best response I've read so far. Mom's \"you're being selfish\" gaslighting is toxic AF too.", "Sounded like she was planning on getting her a gift but after the \"incident\" refused to get her anything as a manipulation tool to get her to do what she wants.", "I think for me it was just the I\u2019m wanted & to bail they wanted typos that had me stumble a little bit. Also agree NTA.", "Also family is clearly self absorbed.", "Oh JFC.  It smacks of boring, deeply unimaginative palates from whatever culture OP's family comes from.  I'm a xenophile and even I don't consider Moroccan cuisine \"normal\"; its flavor profiles are too unusual.", "Not necessarily. I'm Indian and love \"western food\". My parents don't always like eating it and will often say they just want to have normal food. They aren't being racist they just mean they want to have their native food or the type of cuisine they have normally.", "I think she meant an inexpensive restaurant .", "True. The mom and family sound like a piece of work.", "She said what she meant. She meant what she said.", "Idk when I read that I thought of like chilis or ruby tuesday lol"]}
