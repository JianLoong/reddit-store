You can still say things and do things that contribute to racial inequality and prejudice without explicitly wanting to be malicious. Most people would argue that saying other kinds of food is 'not normal', falls in that category. It contributes to keeping prejudices alive about what's normal and what's abnormal. It 'others' other groups of people.\n\nThe issue is that thinking about this stuff requires a certain level of introspection and self-reflection, and a willingness to learn. Many people aren't willing to do that, they just get stuck on the 'well I can't be racist!!'.", "I'd say it's more like narrow-mindedness.
