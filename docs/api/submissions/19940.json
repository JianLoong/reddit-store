If I want pics of me, I have to take them myself. I even told him I'd cook if he wanted to save the money on dinner and he said he'd take me to dinner and still do everything else. I've never been given flowers either, and despite promising ALL OF THIS, we went to dinner. I told him months in advance, if it was too much, to just not get my hopes up. Just tell me if we can only do this or that so I can decide which I'd prefer. Sometimes even if you ask, they still won't.
