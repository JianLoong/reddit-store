I became extremely upset since it was 40\u2022 outside and it was raining. Although my girlfriend and I both had coats, we could\u2019ve gotten sick and we were still very cold. We asked her to go into the car to start it up and warm it up until we came downstairs, 5 minutes later we come downstairs and she was outside trying to open the doors, and I asked her what she was doing. She explained that she locked the keys into the car and I said \u201cwhat the fuck!\u201d I lightly moved her away from me and tried opening the doors for at least 10 minutes. During this time I was getting increasingly upset because I cannot understand how a grown woman can be so clueless as to how to lock **keys** into a car I told her to start. My girlfriend began getting upset which made me more upset at her. \n\nAbout 10 minutes later, she went upstairs and noticed that there was a spare key inside the pot for my brother\u2019s car and handed it to me, I grabbed it from her and after she went inside I drove off. She asked me if I was upset with her once I left and I sent her a series of texts letting her know she was fully out of line for putting my girlfriend and unborn child\u2019s health at risk and I reminded her that I would get defensive and disrespectful when it comes to my family, every single time. \n\nMy aunt thinks I was too harsh on her and that I should apologize, but what she did truly infuriated me.", "created_utc": 1668611235, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ywvw22/aita_for_going_off_on_my_cousin_after_she_locked/", "score": 1460, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was reading this post waiting for the part where somebody realized there's a spare key and that this was basically a non-problem. Except OP spent 10 minutes having a temper tantrum instead. I hate this statement that a \"grown woman\" should never lock keys in the car. Grown people can clearly have accidents.\n\nI also don't understand this whole pregnancy argument. If it was cold and rainy then couldn't you guys have like.....put on jackets.......or gone inside to find the spare key.................?", "YTA. You yelled at a teenager for making a pretty common mistake. You could have just gotten the spare immediately instead of spending time yelling and trying to open the car without it. Makes zero sense. Also, y'all were inside the house? How in the hell was anyone's health somehow at risk here.", "YTA. You barged in like an alpha male and it took you *ten minutes* to realize that when someone says \"I locked the keys in the car\" it means you can't open the doors, and you needed the spare key. Your gf could have gone back inside while you acted out.", "YTA\n\nShe made a mistake with a car she isn\u2019t used to.  You\u2019re about to be a parent and DESPERATELY need to learn to get your temper in check.  \n\nNo one was put at risk.  You had access to the dry house, why would people get sick from the cold rain, were you all just idiotically standing in the rain watching one of you paw at the door for 10 minutes?  \n\nYou reacted to a simple mistake by panicking, yelling, blowing things out of proportion, assuming the worst possible outcome, then holding a grudge and ranting over text.  You are on track to be an awful parent, get help.", "You're an asshole. OMG YTA. An overreacting ass. Honestly I'd say you need anger management classes because that reaction is so over the top. It was an accident. What kind of adult locks keys in cars on accident? Have you never heard of locksmiths?? It's a whole effing industry around people locking themselves out of places. You were an absolute jerk with lame reasoning for your out of line behavior.", "YTA-   \n\n\nFirst off, your unborn childs health was not in danger, it was 40 degrees and raining. Do you think pregnant women can't be in the cold? You also can't \"catch a cold\" when its cold and rainy. Sure it can lower your immune system but a cold is a virus the rain or the cold doesn't make you sick.   \n\n\nSecond, huh? You didn't know immediately there was a spare key in the house? You didn't tel your gf to wait in the house?   \n\n\nLastly, defensive and disrespectful when it comes to your family? ...This coming from the little boy who didn't think that it was a smart idea to look for a spare key or tell your pregnant teenage girlfriend to wait inside? Slow down there.", "YTA - have you considered the possibility that you have anxiety about the high risk pregnancy and are displacing that onto others? There's absolutely no reason to spend ten minutes trying to open a locked car in the rain, you and your gf could have gone inside and called a locksmith or searched for the spare. Sending her a bunch of texts afterwards also speaks to a level of emotional immaturity on your part. You KNOW she didn't mean to do it and was sorry for it. Your tantrum only served to damage your relationship with your guests and likely rile up your SO who really doesn't need that right now.", "YTA. It was an accident. It\u2019s called being human. It wasn\u2019t deliberate or intentional. Your reaction was way out of line and you owe her an apology", "YTA\n\nShe made a mistake. It happens. If this was a pattern where it happened frequently then perhaps you would be justified in being upset, but you need to relax about a one time thing.\n\nAlso, there was a spare key the entire time! So she didn't do shit to put your unborn child's health at risk (which is also a silly exaggeration of the situation). YOU did that by getting so worked up you didn't stop to think for two seconds and go grab the spare key.", "YTA. It was an accident. Of course she didn\u2019t mean to lock the keys in the car. It\u2019s annoying that this happened, but you\u2019re acting kind of dramatic about it. \n\nI also don\u2019t get the point of talking about the weather? Maybe it\u2019s the Michigander in me talking, but 40 degrees with a coat is not that bad. You were outside for 10 minutes. Not to mention it sounds like you were at your house so couldn\u2019t your pregnant gf just gone inside? \n\nRelax.", "YTA and very immature. First, it was an accident. Second, how do you not know you have a spare key? Third, being cold and or wet doesn\u2019t make people sick. Forth, this makes it sound like your girlfriend was unable to go inside to wait, and yet your cousin was able to go inside and get the spare key. Why is that?", "YTA\n\nAdults make mistakes. Sure, anyone would be frustrated but you seem to have no control over your emotions. You definitely need to work on that. \n\nIf you genuinely cared about the health of yoir unborn child, you would've helped your girlfriend back into the house before trying to get the keys out. No one forced her to stand outside.\n\nYou can't get sick just from being in the cold.\n\nSo yeah, all you did was throw a temperature tantrum, you never actually did anything to defend or help your family & instead, divided them further really, by driving a wedge unnecessarily between your cousin & you & your girlfriend. Next time, actually make sure your girlfriend is OK & take action to care for her instead of fuming & stomping about like a toddler.", "YTA bro chill out being upset fine but behaving like a child is out of line and you say she's putting you and your girlfriend health ag risk is your girlfriend not capable of going back inside to not be affected by the rain?", "Yes YTA. On a family vacation I left the keys in the car, later I though my husband grabbed them from the seat. I closed the door and the car locked. So me my husband, my brother, my parents and my in-laws were supposed to go on a dinner and we couldn\u2019t because, obviously we couldn\u2019t drive one of the cars. No one got upset. Although everyone was super hungry. It was around 9 pm. Actually they just made jokes about me. And I told them \u201cdon\u2019t make fun of my because what comes around goes around\u201d and hm yeah next day my FIL also did the same mistake and locked the car with the keys inside. And again everyone was chill. Things like that happen. \n\nAlso what risk were you in? You could have just went upstairs ?", "YTA. She didn\u2019t put anyones health at risk. That was just an asinine statement.", "YTA There was no reason for your girlfriend to stand outside, that was a choice you and her made so don\u2019t try even try the worried about her safety crap! Secondly how are you calling her irresponsible when you guys forgot about your spare key. Funny how you can be forgetful but she can\u2019t make a mistake.", "Yta. And you don't get a cold from being cold. Otherwise people in warm climates would never get sick and people in cold climates would be sick all the time. You get a cold from a virus. Yta.", "Info: do you have a difficult time controlling your temper? Because we\u2019ve ALL locked keys in a car at one point or another, and if you haven\u2019t it\u2019s only because you haven\u2019t been driving long enough. No one did this on purpose, and your reaction was outsized for the infraction. YTA.", "YTA, it was an accident and in the grand scheme of things an incredibly minor one. Worried about how you\u2019ll handle real stress of parenthood if something so minor makes you lose it", "YTA, but don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll just keep defending your position because you don\u2019t want to change. I hope your GF takes a good hard look at your lack of balance and nonexistent emotional regulation.\nShe made a mistake, it happens.", "YTA\nAnd take anger management classes cause that\u2019s messed up.", "YTA. You just wanted an excuse to have a temper tantrum. Does this happen to you often?", "YTA. It was an accident. No need to fly off the handle there. I think you should appologize.", "Yes, you WERE too harsh. Mistakes can happen, by anyone, even you. And the part where 'you risked my gf and child's health' was unnecessary, she could wait inside the house for sometime. You lost your temper way to easily. \nYTA.", "YTA I think you were looking for any reason to have an issue. If you were so frustrated about it why not just call your brother and ask where the spare was to begin with? Why didn't you just go back up the house and stand out of the rain? Hell why was it your cousin who found the keys? Really you don't have any reason to be that angry when she fixed her mistake after making it. Also why was your girlfriend still outside if it was that bad while all of this was going on? She's an adult who knows what cold is she could have just gone back and waited", "YTA. It was an accident. 40 degrees is not a dangerous temperature. Your child's health was not in danger and you could have just gone back inside if you were cold. Drama much?", "YTA by far bro.\n\nYou question how a grown woman locks keys inside a car, yet how does a grown man not realize to use the spare key inside the house?\n\nIt was a mistake. You weren't in the middle of no where. You are being a drama queen and must apologize for beeing an Asshole.", "Yta. I would assume you have never made a mistake in your obviously perfect life", "YTA. Good luck being a parent. Kids have stupid accidents everyday. You may need some counseling for anger management because your actions were completely over the top. IMO.", "YTA major overreaction, it may have been cold but from your references to \"coming downstairs \" it seems like you could have waited inside. Also the fact that you \"noticed the spare key in a bowl\" kinda seems like you definitely where in a house. And it's not even your car. Might want to try some therapy before your kid arrives", "YTA\n\nDramatic, lacking common sense, and downright mean. \n\nWhy couldn\u2019t YOU go start the car? Why did you spend 10 min trying the doors instead of looking for the spare or calling a service to unlock? And what up with this \u201cwe had coats but we could\u2019ve gotten sick\u201d nonsense? You don\u2019t get a cold from being out in the rain. And you two could\u2019ve just stayed in the house. \n\nPeople make mistakes. I\u2019m a grown ass woman and I\u2019ve locked my keys in my car. Most newer cars are pretty idiot proof and won\u2019t lock with the key fob in the vehicle. But older vehicles don\u2019t have that function. \n\nYou grossly overreacted. \n\nYou might want to seek some therapy if this is how you react to a very minor issue. Kids will put you over the edge if this is how you react.", "Yta. Wtf is actually wrong with you. Somebody makes a mistake and honestly let\u2019s face it if you were really concerned about your gf she could have walked be inside the house. Apologize and then get into some anger management classes. You clearly need them", "YTA, damn. You've never locked your keys in the car before? It happens to so many people, all the time. She went down to do you a *favor* and you come downstairs to find she's made a mistake and go off on her like she's stranded you in the middle of nowhere in the freezing rain? You could've easily suggested your girlfriend wait back inside, if you were so concerned about her health. Apologize to your cousin and don't ask her to do you any more favors.", "YTA.  You couldn\u2019t have gone inside to wait while someone else worked on opening the car or called a locksmith or looked for spare keys why, exactly?", "YTA\nFirst off, anyone can accidentally lock keys in a car. Happens all the time and I can 100% guarantee you won't receive any sympathy from your cousin the day you do it.\nSecond why didn't you have your girlfriend wait inside while you figured out what to do? Why make her stay outside and get cold. Sounds to me like you were the one that put your baby at risk not your cousin.\nThird, it's your car.....how in the heck do you not know of the existence of a spare key?\nYour aunt is correct, you over reacted. Apologies to your cousin and gf.", "YTA I get it\u2019s frustrating and annoying. But stop saying your girlfriends health is at risk. She could\u2019ve gone back in the house.  Your whole argument is absurd. The real problem here is that after 10 minutes of trying to unlock the car, and driving away, you were still angry enough to send texts blaming your cousin. It sounds like you have serious anger issues, you should get some help for that before your child arrives. If you think you won\u2019t  flip out on your child like this someday, think again.", "YTA- you overreacted when she was being nice to warm up the car for you and your gf. Also being 18 is not a grown women, many would still consider that a kid. Being that you are going to be a parent I would suggest you learn how to hold your temper. Since kids will make a lot of mistakes growing up.", "Overreact often. Wow. \n\n>I became extremely upset since it was 40\u2022 outside and it was raining. Although my girlfriend and I both had coats, we could\u2019ve gotten sick and we were still very cold.\n\n40 degrees isn't even freezing, rain won't kill you and you don't get a cold from being cold. I think most of us have accidentally locked keys on the car. YTA. A huge one. Apologize.", "YTA. Warm up your own darn car instead of asking/ordering a guest to do it.", "YTA. I literally just said on a different post: accidents happen. You don\u2019t go off like a lunatic. And people grow up with different cars - not every car will automatically lock.", "YTA. People like you are the worst. You get upset about something that was a total accident, and lash out at people, even if there's nothing they can do to help the situation. On top of that, she was doing you a FAVOR, AND you shoved her out of your way. It's not even that you were \"too harsh,\" it's just that you're a giant raging asshole.", "YTA - You and your gf are assholes. Completely overreacting over a situation that could\u2019ve been solved in less than 2 minutes.\n\nSo you\u2019re locked out of your car and the first thing you do is get mad instead of looking for a backup key and the first one your gf does is cry about it instead of going inside where it\u2019s warm????", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Oh people lock keys in their cars. It\u2019s why they have a service to unlock the cars. Imagine another scenario you ask your cousin to start the car. She does.

Next you say it put your unborn baby\u2019s life at risk? No in no way was anyones life at risk. It was 40 degrees out AND you were outside the house which means no one had to wait in the cold.

This is one of the reasons why cold and flu season occurs in the winter each year, and why rates of COVID-19 increased in the late fall and early winter of 2020.\n\n>Cold temperatures also cause blood vessels to constrict. When this happens, your respiratory tract gets fewer white blood cells that it needs to ward off respiratory infections like influenza and bacterial pneumonia.\n\n>Another reason why you\u2019re more likely to get sick in cold temperatures is that you\u2019re probably spending less time outdoors, which can result in a drop in your Vitamin D levels. Your body\u2019s immune system needs Vitamin D to function properly, so getting sunshine, taking a Vitamin D supplement, or incorporating Vitamin D-rich foods into your diet are all useful wintertime strategies to stay as healthy as possible. Vitamin D helps against the risk of complications of infection. In COVID-19 it prevents an exaggerated inflammatory response that has been known to cause severe complications and an increased risk of death.\n\n>\tFinally, there\u2019s also research to suggest that your immune cells are more sluggish in cold temperatures than in warmer temperatures, which is why feeling cold or spending time in cold weather is more likely to make you sick.\n\n[Link](https://www.gohealthuc.com/library/surprising-things-do-and-dont-affect-your-immune-system)", "Right.
