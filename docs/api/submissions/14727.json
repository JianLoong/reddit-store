I'd been working in childcare not long before, and we documented the kids' whole day for the parents, including bathroom/diaper things.

But...she and I really don't think it's right to judge people who are different from us in ways that don't hurt anyone, but we had the HARDEST TIME not rolling our eyes at things like t-shirts and cowboy hats with rhinestones spelling out \"WIFEY\" or \"Future Mrs. ___\" or \"BRIDE.\" It's like...different strokes and all, but I *just don't get it*.\n\nThey also have only one bride appointment at a time, so there was a little changeable letter sign up with \"Future Mrs. Smith Jones\" (not her actual name). I could tell the \"Mrs.\" part bugged her a little when we arrived, but at least they got the combo name right instead of using only her fianc\u00e9's last name. But when we were finished, the stylist took a picture of the two of us with her holding the sign, and for that my friend very deliberately removed the \"R\" and slid the \"S\" over to make \"MS. SMITH JONES.\" To the stylist's credit, she said, \"Oh, I'm so sorry! I forgot that's what you told me you plan to go by on the phone!\" So at least they ask when scheduling the appointments and don't just assume every woman getting married wants to be a \"Mrs.\" I DO wonder what they put on the sign for women who plan to not change their name at all and want to be \"Ms.\" I should've asked. \n\nDone blathering now. \ud83d\ude04", "*raisin shaped rabbit poop", "What I want to know is, if juliett is the fiancee's friend, why have fiance's dad and brother made 'invite juliett or we don't come to the wedding' their hill to die on?
