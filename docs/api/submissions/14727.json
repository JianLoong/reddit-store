Doesn't work that way. I would disinvite fil and brother. Low contact after that. They've shown who they are, believe them. Makes life easier.", "Congrats on the wedding and on having an awesome fianc\u00e9, MIL and SIL. \n\nAlso, add one more job to MIL/SIL: if your FIL/BIL actually do attend, make sure they are CLOSELY chaperoned to ensure they don\u2019t make any surprise \u201cpublic announcements\u201d about you. Absolutely would not trust them at all.", "Well, future FIL and BIL disinvited themselves right out of your wedding, and your lives, didn't they? \nCut the lot of them and live your best life.\nNTA.", "NTA.  She clearly has feelings for him and is trying to sabotage your relationship.  She needs to be expelled from your life, not just your wedding.", "NTA- Don't let the door hit them on the way out.\n\nThat said, don't feel guilty about your past.  You did what you needed to do to survive.  Survival is the deepest human instinct", "NTA\n\nI am glad to hear that your fianc\u00e9 supports you \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA, she is miserable and probably in love with fianc\u00e9. Only hurt people, hurt people", "NTA. Your wedding. You decide who gets to be there. Why is this woman so important to your FIL? If he chooses her over his own son and decides to skip the wedding, that\u2019s on him. He\u2019ll live to regret the decision, though", "Honestly the friend is just mad because she wanted him and you took that away from her\u2026 NTA", "NTA - no need to start the marriage as the family doormat, especially with spousal support of your action.", "NTA\nShe sounds exhausting", "NTA..\n\nNick also needs to get his ass in gear about this \u201cfriend\u201d. A true friend would not try to sabotage the marriage of their best friend, especially in the manner that she\u2019s been trying. I would feel betrayed if Nick continued to have this person in his life, because he\u2019d be allowing Juliet\u2019s abuse and cruelty to continue.\n\nShe crossed a boundary that never should be crossed, and by your description she will not stop until you two are no longer an item. If he continues this friendship, I\u2019m some way, I think he\u2019s reinforcing her efforts", " mate where\u2019s the part where she\u2019s a stalker i\u2019m so confused", "NTA\n\nShe sounds awful. It's super weird that your fiance's dad is so adamant that she be there. I'd love to know what she's got on him that is making him side with her over his own kid. \n\nI'd be telling anyone who sides with her that they aren't welcome at the wedding. \n\nI've read most of your replies on this post and it sounds like you've got defending yourself and your fiance under control, though. Go forth and bomb them with sarcasm and boundaries!", "NTA, but the \"friend\" needs to be removed from your lives, she clearly has designs on your fianc\u00e9 and has done nothing but meddle.\n\nShe needs to go, there needs to be no contact and your fianc\u00e9 needs to tell his parent that you both will not attend any family function or event that she attends.", "NTA. No shot they should be invited.", "NTA. She had no right to divulge your past to your in laws. They don't need to know about that part of your personal history if you didn't want them to.\n\nHer actions make her sound like she has an unhealthy obsession with your fianc\u00e9. Either she holds out a borderline delusional hope that your fianc\u00e9 will decide he wants to be with her (delusional because he is marrying someone else, not because he is marrying a man) or she simply is a narcissistic person who cannot tolerate her friend having a significant other because it takes away from the attention she craves. Either way, she needs to step back and get out of your relationship.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9's father and brother are giving off mild homophobia vibes and just general gross anti sex-work attitudes. I wonder if they view the asshole best friend as the person your fianc\u00e9 \"should\" be with because they don't like having a queer son/brother.", "Why are the dad and brother so invested in a non-family friend coming to this wedding..?\n\nAll very weird. NTA. They told you who they were and what values they stand by. If your fiance supports you, you're probably doing everything you can. Best wishes and congratulations", "NTA. Glad your fiance is standing by your side. Juliett, his dad, and brother need to grow up and get over themselves.", "You know you're not. You are just here for a pat on the back.\n\nYTA.", "NTA  \nShe(trouble) made her choice to out you to his family. You made the choice to uninvite her due to her behavior. His father and brother have made the choice to stand behind trouble & uninvited themselves. Don't regret choices you didn't make. Enjoy your wedding.", "This, OP. I'm glad your partner has your back. Please block this woman from all social media and give a picture of her to any security. Your partner needs to tell his dad and brother that he knew your history and loves you. If what they heard changed things for them, they can skip the wedding, but they should be aware this will likely lead to never having another holiday together. If you decide to have kids, they won't be grandpa and uncle, they'll be no one. So they should decide who they value more, this woman, or the relationship with their son and brother.", "Yep.\n\nStalker wants fianc\u00e9 for herself.  And the father and brother want that to happen, too.", "The only people that should be there are ones that will be genuinely happy for you and your spouse.", "She knows. She seems to have always accepted him, but with all this insanity... well, we are beginning to think She carries a torch for him. \n\nAs a side note, we are both fans of the old TV series Grimm. I pulled the names Nick and Juliett from there lol.", "Hahaha I laughed so hard! Also, why in the world does his father wants this woman at the wedding, why is she so important? She\u2019s his son friend, he should respect his son and his future husband decision", "Your fianc\u00e9 needs to have a serious talk with dad and brother about his friend disrespecting his relationship and him not wanting her there. Nta", "I think your fianc\u00e9's dad and brother are taking this stance because they've secretly always hoped your partner would leave you for her. They want you to stand aside for her at your own wedding because they prioritize her over you and your fianc\u00e9. They don't see you as belonging to the family, but they do see her that way.", "Haha...I have a shirt that says hippity hoppity..your soul is my property", "Dad seems to feel that the girl is more family than you or his son.", "I wouldn\u2019t go forward with the wedding knowing that. They are not good people.", "Something tells me that if you had been female, they might not have had such a problem withbit....publicly at least", "That's vile. And... weird? Like, as you're a gay man without the equipment to bear children, why is she using misogynistic language that's used to denigrate female sex workers? Like, used up *how*, exactly? I've been re-reading that statement, and trying to wrap my head around it...\n\nNTA. Mazel tov on your coming nuptials!", "I fully understand and respect you probably wouldn\u2019t hit a woman because you sound like a good person with morals lol but as a woman I would love to just give her a good one two for you for that statement alone. Holy crap.", "WTAF. These people are out of their danged minds trying to bully you into allowing that girl anywhere near your wedding or your lives. Neither of you should associate with her ever again.", "I hope your fiance recognizes she is not his friend.", "I am filing that one away for future use \ud83e\udd23 I have many a family member this would apply to.", "She\u2019s sound god awful and like I would just hate I\u2019m being around her energy.", "Omg I\u2019ve read a lot of your replies and I REALLY wanna be your friend!!!!!!", "Shhh. It's not old yet. \ud83d\ude2d", "My first thought? Homophobia. Dad is still in denial and hoping his son will see the light and get together with the bestie. He's also on her side because she gave a \"valid\" reason to try to force OP out of the picture.", "My thought too. She\u2019s into his fianc\u00e9 as more than a friend and his dad and half brother approve of it. Specially with OP admitting they\u2019re super conservative. They want her to save him from OP and back into a \u201crighteous path\u201d with a woman.", "She's secretly in love with him, and his parents don't like that he's gay. She probably doesn't like that he's dating a man either.", "He ended their friendship. I had to leave the room, because there was a lot of screaming and cussing on her end, and I don't do well around raised voices.", "Also,\n\nMoving forward OP needs to tell the dad and brother to only communicate to you through your husband. \n\nIt's your husbands job to keep the crazies on his side of the family quarantined from you. And vice versa.\n\nAnd a great as Nick is for being by your side throughout, I hope he really rethinks his friendship with Juliett. She crossed a line that should never be crossed.", " The Jerry Springer Show jk", "Good point, many people will use that as an excuse why someone shouldn\u2019t be with someone, pretty stupid in my opinion, but conservative people are like that", "How did she find out about your past?", "Nah no way the conservative man draw the line at being a sex worker when this he cheated \ud83d\udc80", "You clearly have never witnessed the cultural experience of The Jerry Springer Show jk\n\nSometimes physical attractiveness isn't the draw, but merely the drama of \"stealing\" someone's partner.", "She's a private investigator and decided to do some digging for ANYTHING she could find to use against me."]}
