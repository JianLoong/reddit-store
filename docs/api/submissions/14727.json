If they want to choose some weird stalker girl over their own son, they never cared much for him in the first place. Let them have their tantrum, go no contact with them also, get into therapy, and move on with your lives.", "NTA- You and your fiance agree and that's the only thing that matters. Its really weird his dad and brother care that much. Seems like theres a weird dynamic going on there", "So she was intentionally digging into your past for dirt. You'll be better off cutting contact with her. I'm glad your fianc\u00e9 is supporting you in this situation.", "NTA\n\nYour future husband sided with you. Over his own friend. That's all you need to know.\n\nIf those two don't want to attend either... then fuck em!\n\nThey're being the selfish assholes here. This isn't their party or their guest list.\n\nThey'll also be missing out on their son and brothers wedding.

NTA. She's TA. To out your past like that is just atrocious behavior. You have every right to ban her from the wedding. That's horrible.", "NTA, I do not blame you AT ALL! Everyone has a past and it is none of her business. If things weren't bad before, they will be now. It's your day and you should be comfortable and happy.", "NTA \n\nYou have the right to invite or not invite whoever you want. Why allow someone who is rude  or may intentionally cause a scene or embarrassment? \nI'm curious how did she find out about your past? I have zero doubt she dropped that info to try to break you up or at least ruin any chance you will have at any relationship with inlaws.", "NTA. FIL and BIL won't come if this twit can't? Bonus.", "NTA. It's your wedding, you don't even need to justify disinviting anyone who's not going to make you happy.", "NTA. Juliett's actions, such as outing your past to your fianc\u00e9's family, are intrusive and disrespectful. It is understandable that you would want to disinvite her from the wedding, as her behavior has caused significant distress and conflict. You and your fianc\u00e9 should be able to celebrate your special day with people who are supportive and respectful of your relationship. It is commendable that your fianc\u00e9 is standing by your decision, as it demonstrates a united front. While it is unfortunate that his dad and brother may not attend the wedding, it is important to prioritize your own well-being and boundaries over appeasing others.", "NTA. That was not her business to share WHATSOEVER. Your Fianc\u00e9e accepts you with open arms and a full understanding and that\u2019s the only person you owed that information to period. It is you and your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s wedding, so who comes and doesn\u2019t is ALL y\u2019all\u2019s choice. She crossed a big line and it is completely reasonable to leave her out and even cut her off. If his father and brother cannot see the issue, maybe it\u2019s better they stay out of it altogether because they don\u2019t love him enough, clearly.", "NTA I don't get future BIL and FIL's refusal to come to the wedding. Are they refusing because of your prior sex work or because of Juilette's being banned. But that is Nick's discussion not yours. He should take lead with his relatives about why theys are boycotting his wedding.", "NTA. The only thing she could hope to accomplish is to cause your breakup, so it's completely understandable to not want her at your wedding.", "NTA, I think you should accept their proposal and disinvite them both along with the creepy chick.", "Definitely NTA! Your future husband sounds like a great bloke and he is standing up for what is right!  I\u2019m hoping that they will actually realise that Juliet has been manipulating them this whole time to and  if she refuses to be nothing but excited and happy for Nick who she is supposed to love its better to nip it in the bud now and ensure she isn\u2019t able to cause a scene on your wedding day.

I presume that is why the dad and half brother have any opinion at all? \n\nYou don't need a person so intent on stirring up drama at your wedding. \n\nLet your fiance handle his dad. If your FIL-to-be calls again, politely tell him that this is between him and his son. \n\nEVERYONE has a past. Don't let anyone get on their high horse trying to make you feel bad. In my experience, the more someone is trying to shame others for their past, the more messed up they are about their own.

Dad and bro are being judgmental, this has nothing to do with the friend\u2019s \u201cside.\u201d Honestly, you have fianc\u00e9, mom and sister on your side.

You shouldn't have to spend it worrying about what one of your guests is saying about you.  \n  \nAnd why do his dad and brother care anyway?  Is their happiness somehow dependent on her being there?  Her absence is going to ruin your wedding for them?  \n\nYour fiance's father would rather ruin his own son's wedding than act like an adult.  He's TA, not you.", "NTA. Seems like she is in love with you fianc\u00e9 and probably thinks if she can make you go away she will get him.
