The outcomes are vastly different as well as recovery. Were you a bit rude? Perhaps, but NTA.", "NTA- Mary was taking away from the people who are actually struggling by making a comparison to her dog. I get she was probably trying to sympathize but it was an inappropriate comment to make and clearly made people uncomfortable.

He's the one who asked her to leave because of her comments. That didn't have anything to do with you", "NTA I love my dog. I love her fuzzy little butt. She brings me joy everyday. However, she's a dog. I am not a dog mom. I hate when people call me her Mommy, it makes my skin crawl.\n\nIf you don't know what to say to someone who is grieving the loss of a friend or family member not equating with your experience with your pet is common sense.", "NTA. I can confirm you are right, and acted correctly. \n\nYour brother's girlfriend comparing a sick dog to a sick child in front of the child's mother was deeply hurtful. While she may have had good intentions, she was very, very rude to equate a child's life with a household pet.

It was good that you stood up for your family friend in that moment.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA. I grew up in a household with dozens of dogs. One of our dogs used to guard my little brother's crib at night, every night, while he was a toddler. Dogs are the absolute best, but what Mary said is just appalling and you were right to stop her from putting her foot in it further.", "NTA as a dog lover myself you were absolutely right its not the same. If this woman had a child herself she would've known that.", "Unless someone else in that room had been through the same situation where their child was dealing with medical issues and could possibly die, no one should've taken the opportunity to claim \"I know what you're going through\". The fact that Mary's story was about her dog just added insult to injury.\n\nI understand that it's really hard for people to just shut the f--- up and listen when people are grieving but we need to get better at it. Most of the time people are desperate to try to \"fix\" the situation by saying exactly the right thing that will make the grieving person feel better, but end up making themselves look like an ass. Because NOTHING they say or do is going to fix the situation or make that person feel better. Platitudes belittle their suffering. Comparisons are only for attention-seekers. If you really want to comfort someone who's mourning you tell them you're so sorry they're hurting, let them know you love them, and make a sincere and specific offer to help them (e.g. \"I go grocery shopping every Saturday afternoon. Can I text you that morning to ask for your shopping list and I can pick you up whatever you want?\"), not just the empty \"let me know if you need anything\" (they won't).\n\nMary doesn't sound malicious but her cluelessness only added to their suffering. Her feelings about her dog may be valid but trying to compare her experience to theirs is incredibly thoughtless. Normally, I'd say Mary should apologize but that just might make those parents feel worse as she'd be bringing up an already sensitive subject. I would just warn her to do what I suggested above instead of tactlessly trying to relate to something with which she has absolutely no experience.

She might have felt similar grief about her dog. However I think comparing her dog with someone's son is still wrong. Here is why:\n\nFor the three hundred thousand years we've been petting dogs, from the start dogs were living as the part of the clan as protectors, and we fed them in return. There's a really sweet loyalty and love that they give us, and we give them as well.\n\nSome people tend to put a cat or a dog above averyone else due to some personal reasons. Those reasons aren't being a \"problem only white developed nation people could encounter\" but more of \"noone can love us more than them or their love is so pure\" reasons.\n\nSome people may see their dogs as best friends, some may see as their child.

But as you said you don\u2019t understand how some people can care for pets as much as they do so you don\u2019t agree. \n\nEveryone needs to cool off and then have a calm conversation and move on. This isn\u2019t something worth staying mad or continually fighting about.", "Nta and I am one of those vile people who think it's wacky to save a stranger over your dog to whom you have an actual moral obligation to protect/care for.

Animals are wonderful, pets can give love and be \"like\" family - and neither should ever be abused. That said, no animal's life is worth any human's and especially a child's in the eyes of their parent. No one can change another's mind, the individual must do that for themself. But if a few years from now Mary has a child and is asked: \"if you heard a screech of brakes and a crash and you run outside to find your child and pet both dead, which would you be more upset about?\" if she answers \"pet\" she has not changed her mind and is indeed a bad person. No mentally stable parent would grieve more over a dead pet than a dead child. PERIOD.", "NTA.

If a pet parent had to choose between their dog whom they\u2019ve raised with love vs a random human stranger, they\u2019re going to choose their dog, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.

But the friend can handle those feelings or call it out herself. that\u2019s not your job. You were rude to Mary by invalidating her experience and also humiliating her in mixed company. Dogs might seem less important to YOU in the scheme of things, but to a lot of other people, animals are just as much part of the family as the other people in said family. I have a cat.

In terms of philosophy, I'd personally say the debate about the 'value' of any living being (vs. another), is complex, subjective and personal. Sure, in much law and to many people, any human should be prioritised over any non-human animal. There can be religious and/or personal moral reasons for that belief.\n\nHowever, it could also be argued, there isn't an OBJECTIVELY inherent reason for that (and please hear me out first - I HAVE still voted OP very much NTA, for reasons I explain). Most species have an essential role to play in the working of the planet, and so are arguably as important as humans as a result. Indeed, it could even be argued certain individual animals contribute more good vs. harm (even judged by human priorities), compared to certain humans. \n\nIt could also be argued, that humans are generally prioritised not because of AUTOMATIC and OBJECTIVE 'value' over non-humans - but because humans tend to prioritise their own, and humans are usually the ones with power. Yet who is most 'important' IS still highly subjective. A (non-human) mother animal will often consider her own babies to be the most important beings in the world - and will try to kill any other being (human or non-human) who threatens them. And many humans will be more distressed by the demise of an animal they know/love, than a human they don't. \n\nSo I would say overall, the 'value' (of any living being) is subjective - not objective.\nBut then we come to the question whether the potential death of a 9-year-old boy, should be compared (in conversation with his parents) to somebody else's anxiety over a dog's surgery. I'd say ABSOLUTELY NOT. That's crass and insensitive. It DOESN'T even come down to a general debate, re: value of humans vs. non-humans. \n\nAnd it DOESN'T matter, if the child's 'value' over an animal is subjective or objective. What matters in this case, is their children ARE the most important beings in the world (to most parents). Love for a child, will generally override all other love a parent might feel in life, for other humans or non-humans. Indeed, that will generally include any pets the parents themselves might own. And so, parents will generally suffer far more than most pet-owners, if their child's survival is at stake. \n\nMost people eventually come to terms with the loss of a pet (or indeed, the natural deaths of older relatives). However, the loss of a child (because of the emotional space, that children are programmed by nature, to fulfil in most parents), is often understood to create life-long agony. So to compare a dog's surgery, to the anxiety of parents over their own child's survival - it's just not comparable, to those parents. Instead, it comes across as insensitive, self-focused, and clueless.", "NTA. I used to have a friend like this it didn\u2019t matter what we were going through she would always have to make everything about her and seemingly try to top our experiences.

But anyone younger is not. And my dog is my life, but it's still not something to be compared to human life. Dogs have a shorter life expectancy, so you KNOW you will outlive your dog in most cases.

Some people are just socially awkward and being treated like she was just makes it worse.", "This type of thing is part of why I am not sold on becoming a parent. I already love my cats so much that it can sometimes leave me feeling overwhelmed how I can love a creature so much. It makes me wonder how I could ever handle having a kid and dealing with so much more love and anxiety and emotions than I am capable of imagining let alone dealing with.", "I had a dog that I loved very much. She was spoiled rotten and thought she was a person. She was the best dog I could ever ask for. It devastated me when she died. After she passed I got pregnant and had a baby. My son got covid in December and was having trouble breathing because of some asthma. It's not the same thing in the slightest. I don't know how people can walk around so oblivious as to actually think it's the same thing", "I have 2 cats and a dog currently. I love them dearly and when I think about life without them, I cry. When our oldest cat dies I will be a wreck. \n\nMy daughter nearly died in front of me a few years ago and I have diagnosed PTSD from the incident. If she had died, I probably wouldn\u2019t be typing this. \n\nA pet dying is just nowhere near the same thing.", "I went to my placement the next day after my cat died, and after my grandma died. Because I had no choice, or I'd be kicked out of the program. I was much more torn up about my cat dying, as I knew my grandma was dying for quite some time at that point. To this day, I've grieved far more for my cat.\n\nYour husband is an A who doesn't understand false comparisons. Bereavement is often only for certain family relationships, and a big middle finger to the rest of us who have relationships that don't fit that mold. Because apparently friends and pets can't compare to the death of someone whose DNA is closer than average to our own.", "Wow. My boss is hardcore about taking time off. I still took three unpaid days off when my pet died. I was useless. Cried constantly for those three days. I\u2019d take longer off if I had a child that died, though.", "If you can\u2019t really understand then it\u2019s best not to make comparisons. She meant well, but she said something kind of insensitive and hurtful, so she should still apologize. We\u2019ve all said dumb shit unintentionally, and the correct follow up is to apologize and mentally make note to never do something like that ever ever again.", "Yeah, I get that impression, too. Like her heart was in the right place, but her head was up her ass. And I feel like a lot of folks, esp Neurodivergent/autistics (hi!) try to be supportive by sharing stories we think are similar, but our idea of similar is...sometimes idiosyncratic, and sometimes genuinely fucked up. Which, you know. \"bad at social cues.\"   \nSo, yeah, Mary's an asshole, OP handled it exactly correctly (even if she's not ND, I don't think anything less blunt would have worked). If folks want to have a family meeting to try to explain to Mary where she fucked up, that would be a kindness to Mary and anyone else she'll do that to in the future.", "If you honestly think it's even the tiniest bit acceptable to tell a mother who's terrified of losing her sick child that you understand how she's feeling because \"your pet once had surgery\" I sincerely question your humanity.", "You know what you say in that case? \"I'm so sorry, I can't even imagine what you're dealing with.\"", "It's beyond rude and callous to even try comparing the loss of a child to the loss of a pet. It might be the closest thing she's experienced, but her experience is irrelevant. No one is saying pets aren't important, but during a conversation about actual child loss, pet parents just need to keep their mouths shut.", "Doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s such a giant difference in comparison that giving your closest personal example is still insensitive. If someone\u2019s house burned down and you once lost a purse you really liked would you console them by saying \u201cOh man I know most how you feel, I was super upset that time I lost my favourite purse\u201d? Of course not, because regardless of how valid your feelings are in relation to your own experience they would not be comparable to the magnitude of the loss that the person who lost their home would be feeling.\n\nTo empathize, there needs to be a similarity in magnitude. You may think there is, but ask any parent and they will confirm that the love you have for a pet is completely dwarfed by the love you have for a child.\n\nIt would be the equivalent of someone having their dog die and you saying \u201cOh yeah, I know how you feel, I once bought a goldfish from the pet shop and it died on the drive home\u201d. That is the difference we are talking about.", "I can't stand the whole fur baby thing and it's become so common place now. I once, as a joke, called my daughter and nephew my \"skin babies\" they thought it was hilarious and now it's a family joke...i wish I hadn't started that.", "It certainly wasn\u2019t coming from a bad place, but he had not choice but to cut it short too.", "Why does a human life hold more value? Why should others care and value a stranger more than a part of their life?", "Does it? Or was she trying to commiserate and OP seized the opportunity to talk down to her?  Have you ever had something intended to express empathy come out poorly?", "Here's the thing. If your pet is the thing that you have felt the most love for ever in your life thus far then yes it is the same.  You are stuck on the idea of comparing a kid and a pet. Mary has not experienced having a child so she is literally incapable of making the comparison she is accused of.", "Not even close. I hope you never find yourself barren and unable to love anything that didn\u2019t come from your own dna", "Not everyone can have children so there is no objective way for them to compare the  bond between pet and child.", "Not all of us get to experience the privilege of having a kid so a pet is the closest thing. You don\u2019t get to shit on us just bc you have the privilege to breed. If it came down to my dog or your kid. You bet your ass I\u2019m saving my dog bc your kid is your responsibility that you chose", "I don't drive because I'm terrified of hitting a pet!", "You\u2019re going to be an animal in a meat factory in your next life.", "Can we stop acting like Mary told her to suck it up and get over it? She was trying to relate. Just bc you view animals as worthless beings under your superior feet doesn\u2019t mean humans are worth shit. Watch a war video in Ukraine and tell me you\u2019d save them", "Can I keep you on speed \"DM\", I NEVER can come up with good stuff like that.  \nOne of my friend's cats passed away unexpectedly recently.  I had nothing useful to say.  I'm not much of a rainbow bridge person.    \nAnd my brain(not my mouth/typing) said blessedly it was a peaceful passing.  Mine have been very sick cats who have to see a vet to be saved from more pain.", "Honestly, OP cutting the conversation like that was probably the best way to go. Any longer or if someone tried to nicely, I can only imagine her digging herself into a deeper hole.", "Being socially awkward doesn\u2019t give you permission to do hurtful things. If you\u2019re being hurtful someone should tell you to stop. You should then apologize, try and understand where you went wrong, and take steps to avoid doing such things again in the future. That\u2019s how we all learn and grow.", "I\u2019ve lost dogs young and old, had to put several to sleep for health issues. It goddamn sucks. \n\nIf my child died I\u2019d crawl into a fucking bottle and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d crawl out. No parent should have to bury their kid.", "I also have ptsd after my daughter\u2019s brain cancer diagnosis. Hugs!", "I\u2019m so glad someone pointed this out\u2026 before my wife and I got married, I could not have taken time off work if, god forbid, anything had happened to her, because she wasn\u2019t family\u2026 but my father who I haven\u2019t seen or spoken to in 10 years would get me a week of bereavement leave\u2026 \n\nNow that we\u2019re married, I can take bereavement if her grandma, who I\u2019ve met 3 times total, dies.\n\nIt\u2019s just absolutely insane to me the narrow scope of relationships that are considered \u201cacceptable\u201d to need time to grieve\u2026.", "Nothing to do with DNA, completely having to do with knowing a human beings entire backstory and living alongside them for their entire life as their guardian, mentor, playmate and teacher. My grandma is amazing and I love her with all my heart and call her almost every single day but unless you spend your life in the sort of close interwoven loving coexistence that typically only exists between a parent and a child you just won\u2019t understand the bond that forms. \n\nYou\u2019re there for every heartbreak, triumph, fear and comfort, every new challenge and every scared retreat. You are their safe haven and they are your reason to do everything with more life and purpose. You can have a wonderful amazing life without children, but if being a parent is something you commit to it can be one of the most beautiful and deeply meaningful facets of your life.", "Sorry just think it's hilarious your kid called you a \"narc\"", "Us edgelords always reap what we sow :(", "Ntm hammering in our head that we\u2019ll never know what it\u2019s like isn\u2019t exactly an angel move in itself. If we can\u2019t have kids no duh we\u2019ll never know what it\u2019s like but that\u2019s not something that they get to shame us for", "If your pet is the thing you\u2019ve felt the most love for, that is tremendously sad even if you\u2019re childless.", "Who said anything about being unable to love?", "Then they should do it.\n\nEdit: supposed to say should*n\u2019t* do it.", "You seem to have a lot of baggage about not having children. I hope you get to a better place with that.", "That\u2019s honestly not a bad response imo! My friends who are a couple lost one of their cats back in August because she kept eating houseplants and other things that weren\u2019t meant for her. Her last few hours she was in pain before they put her down. It\u2019s a blessing to not have to see your pet suffer like that before they go. I\u2019m honestly not good at comforting people, it makes me uncomfortable. All I can do is let them know I\u2019m there for them, whether they wanna talk about it or not, yk?", "That is a really good comparison. My pets are like my lil furry besties.", "Seriously. Lives are completely devastated by the death of a child. It ends marriages. It literally destroys people. When your dog dies, as expected it will, you\u2019re sad and then you get another dog.", "3 days for the death of a child? That seems inhumane to me.", "My boss did the same thing, I lost a dog in 2020 and it was sudden, unexpected, and honestly I needed a day off. It would have came out of my PTO and she wouldn't have had a problem with it whatsoever. I did end up taking a day for bereavement instead only because my grandmother (whom I didn't actually care about, she was not a nice person), happened to die the same day.\n\nHonestly anyone who would deny PTO for something like this is just cruel.", "My old boss was the same, one day for a pet and it had to be PTO. We could have up to a week for family.  As for others it was one day bereavement or PTO at the supervisor's discretion.  I used PTO for my aunt (did not ask for bereavement).  When I lost a longtime friend in Iraq, I was given bereavement, found out that the company policy was KIA military funerals were bereavement.", "They are little savages", "Oh my gosh.  My BIL and his wife lived together for about five years and got a shelter dog.  She expressed disappointment because the dog has it's issues from being mistreated.  They are child free by choice, fine.  Right before their wedding they got a puppy.  They took the dog with them everywhere and carried it around in their arms, on it's back, in a blanket, treating it like a baby.  Baby talking it, taking it home to put down for naps.   I finally couldn't contain my eye rolling after my mother in law started saying stuff like \"and I got to see my grand puppy today!\"  I still roll my eyes.  \nThe dog is now treated like a dog and they went back to their normal child-free life but it was about six months of that.", "I am one of those people who would absolutely save my cat over a random human. I\u2019m also a socialist and militant supporter of free lunch for children and all that jazz. They aren\u2019t mutually exclusive lol. I believe I have a moral obligation to protect all living things but in a situation of life or death where I can only choose one, I\u2019m picking the one that\u2019s most important to me and the one that I signed up to take care of for the rest of their life.", "couldn\u2019t imagine loving a dog more than my actual mother or father and they weren\u2019t the best parents lol, crazy mentality people have.", "Not everyone can conceive, or afford a child through other means, even adoption.  \n\nVery insensitive.", "Maybe if people stop shaming me bc \u201cI\u2019ll never know what it\u2019s like to have a real child\u201d and acting like my animal children are less then. It\u2019s real easy to be high and mighty when pregnancy won\u2019t kill you. Kind of hard to love a child I\u2019m not allowed to have", "That is a cruel thing to say someone, Mary.\n\nI hope you can find peace in your life.", "It\u2019s like someone saying your mom your dad and your siblings are all on a cliff - a man w gun says pick one or I will kill them all - who would you pick.  There is no way anyone can predict what they would really do", "My company allows time off for a loss of a pet. You get a week and half off paid at my company. And for the loss of a close relative ie:parents, children is a month. Anything beyond those days comes out of sick days and PTO.", "I never suggested they were mutually exclusive. I also never criticized someone for wanting to save their pet over a stranger (though I do hope said person is not the only one around if I\u2019m trapped in a burning building etc.)\n\nLike I said, I find these \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios reductive.\n\nLots of reactionary \u201cbUt My CaT\u201d commenters. I hope you\u2019re all ok.", "Sorry I typoed. I meant they should*n\u2019t* do it, meaning they shouldn\u2019t make the comparison.", "It\u2019s not an act. There\u2019s no shame in not having children, but no your pets are not equivalent to children.", "As someone who is autistic, it\u2019s no an excuse. We can still learn not to compare a dying child to our pet getting surgery", "While I do agree that your child\u2019s death ought to be much harder(can\u2019t stress how much harder) than the death of your pet, your pet is also irreplaceable.

That's why my opinion was ESH.", "In her life, it is equivalent.  Try to be empathetic.", "My sister's first dog died, and she replaced him with her current dog. She doesn't even talk about her first dog now. If my child died, I'd be talking about them every day, and that pain wouldn't go away. My brother died when he was an infant. It's totally different and not even on the same scale.", "When your cat die, let me know. I ll send you another cat.", "I guess I struggle to see why it\u2019s  rude to tell someone to stop making insensitive comments to a grieving mother.", "Wait...I know you didn't reply to me, but I'm always in where free cats are involved.", "Our cat passed away many years ago. DH and I cried, we mourned deeply and 10 years later we still miss him and talk about him. I was able to continue, go to work after a couple of days and be cognitively okay. Upset of course, missing him but I was okay.\n\nIf I lost my children I would be dead inside. Walking and going on but I\u2019d be dead. The very thought fills me with absolute dread. I\u2019d be continuing for the sake of my surviving children and my DH. Otherwise I\u2019d see no point because to me, my children are like my hearts outside my body.\n\nIf I was telling someone that my child might die and they told me they know how I feel because their pet had surgery and they were anxious\u2026wow. Just wow."]}
