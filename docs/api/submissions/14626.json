That was once online, but it seems to be bleeding into real life at times. \n\nYesterday, a family friend was telling my family and my brothers girlfriend Mary (f25) how her son is having major medical issues which could ultimately take his life and how she and her husband were not dealing with it well at all, and my brothers girlfriend said, \u201cI understand what you are going through, when Kennedy (her dog) needed surgery, she didn\u2019t know how to deal with it and was a mess.\u201d\n\nEveryone kind of got quiet because she was comparing the life of a dog to a nine-year-old child, and she said it like it was totally normal.

Mary added Kennedy is like a child to her, and before she could go on, I just blurted out something like \u201cnot the same at all, please stop talking.\u201d \n\nMary did stop talking, but it made everything uncomfortable, so everyone called it an evening. My Dad asked Mary to leave and told my brother he needed to ensure he and Mary somehow made this right because that was heartless. My mom said she wasn\u2019t sure how to end the conversation after that, but my method wasn\u2019t it. \n\nMy brother hasn\u2019t said much other than he gets it, but he is still upset with me.

Perhaps, but NTA.", "NTA- Mary was taking away from the people who are actually struggling by making a comparison to her dog.

I can confirm you are right, and acted correctly. \n\nYour brother's girlfriend comparing a sick dog to a sick child in front of the child's mother was deeply hurtful.

It was good that you stood up for your family friend in that moment.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA. I grew up in a household with dozens of dogs. One of our dogs used to guard my little brother's crib at night, every night, while he was a toddler.

If this woman had a child herself she would've known that.", "Unless someone else in that room had been through the same situation where their child was dealing with medical issues and could possibly die, no one should've taken the opportunity to claim \"I know what you're going through\". The fact that Mary's story was about her dog just added insult to injury.\n\nI understand that it's really hard for people to just shut the f--- up and listen when people are grieving but we need to get better at it. Most of the time people are desperate to try to \"fix\" the situation by saying exactly the right thing that will make the grieving person feel better, but end up making themselves look like an ass. Because NOTHING they say or do is going to fix the situation or make that person feel better. Platitudes belittle their suffering. Comparisons are only for attention-seekers. If you really want to comfort someone who's mourning you tell them you're so sorry they're hurting, let them know you love them, and make a sincere and specific offer to help them (e.g. \"I go grocery shopping every Saturday afternoon. Can I text you that morning to ask for your shopping list and I can pick you up whatever you want?\"), not just the empty \"let me know if you need anything\" (they won't).\n\nMary doesn't sound malicious but her cluelessness only added to their suffering. Her feelings about her dog may be valid but trying to compare her experience to theirs is incredibly thoughtless.

Here is why:\n\nFor the three hundred thousand years we've been petting dogs, from the start dogs were living as the part of the clan as protectors, and we fed them in return. There's a really sweet loyalty and love that they give us, and we give them as well.\n\nSome people tend to put a cat or a dog above averyone else due to some personal reasons.

Animals are wonderful, pets can give love and be \"like\" family - and neither should ever be abused. That said, no animal's life is worth any human's and especially a child's in the eyes of their parent. No one can change another's mind, the individual must do that for themself. But if a few years from now Mary has a child and is asked: \"if you heard a screech of brakes and a crash and you run outside to find your child and pet both dead, which would you be more upset about?\" if she answers \"pet\" she has not changed her mind and is indeed a bad person.

In terms of philosophy, I'd personally say the debate about the 'value' of any living being (vs. another), is complex, subjective and personal. Sure, in much law and to many people, any human should be prioritised over any non-human animal. There can be religious and/or personal moral reasons for that belief.\n\nHowever, it could also be argued, there isn't an OBJECTIVELY inherent reason for that (and please hear me out first - I HAVE still voted OP very much NTA, for reasons I explain). Most species have an essential role to play in the working of the planet, and so are arguably as important as humans as a result. Indeed, it could even be argued certain individual animals contribute more good vs. harm (even judged by human priorities), compared to certain humans. \n\nIt could also be argued, that humans are generally prioritised not because of AUTOMATIC and OBJECTIVE 'value' over non-humans - but because humans tend to prioritise their own, and humans are usually the ones with power. Yet who is most 'important' IS still highly subjective. A (non-human) mother animal will often consider her own babies to be the most important beings in the world - and will try to kill any other being (human or non-human) who threatens them. And many humans will be more distressed by the demise of an animal they know/love, than a human they don't. \n\nSo I would say overall, the 'value' (of any living being) is subjective - not objective.\nBut then we come to the question whether the potential death of a 9-year-old boy, should be compared (in conversation with his parents) to somebody else's anxiety over a dog's surgery. I'd say ABSOLUTELY NOT. That's crass and insensitive. It DOESN'T even come down to a general debate, re: value of humans vs. non-humans. \n\nAnd it DOESN'T matter, if the child's 'value' over an animal is subjective or objective. What matters in this case, is their children ARE the most important beings in the world (to most parents). Love for a child, will generally override all other love a parent might feel in life, for other humans or non-humans. Indeed, that will generally include any pets the parents themselves might own. And so, parents will generally suffer far more than most pet-owners, if their child's survival is at stake. \n\nMost people eventually come to terms with the loss of a pet (or indeed, the natural deaths of older relatives). However, the loss of a child (because of the emotional space, that children are programmed by nature, to fulfil in most parents), is often understood to create life-long agony. So to compare a dog's surgery, to the anxiety of parents over their own child's survival - it's just not comparable, to those parents. Instead, it comes across as insensitive, self-focused, and clueless.", "NTA. I used to have a friend like this it didn\u2019t matter what we were going through she would always have to make everything about her and seemingly try to top our experiences.

I have OCD and on bad days I will get insane pictures in my head of car accidents etc that get so intense I often forget it didn't happen - usually involving my dog being hurt. But even tho he means everything to me, I know it is not comparable to a child and would never inject my fears and pain regarding my dog in a setting regarding anyone younger than 85 being close to death basically. \n\nI have worked with elderly care, so old people dying is a natural thing. But anyone younger is not. And my dog is my life, but it's still not something to be compared to human life. Dogs have a shorter life expectancy, so you KNOW you will outlive your dog in most cases.

I happen to agree that pets can sometimes be grieved more than humans. And that often isn't recognised in the world. It does indeed come down to the attitude, that animals are always 'less' important than humans (which isn't objective, but subjective) - and that deep bonds are somehow not possible, with animals.\n\nHowever, I DO think it was nevertheless insensitive of Mary in this scenario, to compare her dog's operation to the potential death of this couple's child. Whilst pets and other humans can of course be grieved deeply, the loss of a human child tends to be in a league of its own. This has been demonstrated time and time again, by psychological research. The loss of a human child, will generally produce far more complex, agonising, and long-lasting grief, than all other types of bereavement. \n\nIt doesn't matter, what philosophical debates we might make, about DNA or the value of animals vs. humans. Deeply-programmed emotional (and primeval) reactions, aren't subject to such debates in the pain they produce. And so, losing a human child WILL generally cause far more intense and complex pain to most parents, compared to anyone's loss of a pet (or the loss of any other human).\n\nJust because an experience is legitimately painful to you, doesn't mean it's on the level of other people's pain. Nor does it mean, you can relate to the issues certain deaths will bring up (which tend to be particularly complex in the death of a child), simply because you've experienced death (of either a human, or a pet). To believe you do relate, can sometimes be an inability to see beyond the end of your own nose. \n\nI've lost pets, and suffered greatly as a result. But when I met a friend, whose sister had been murdered in front of her by a machete, did I say 'Oh, I totally get it. I've lost pets'?! That wasn't even my friend's child. But OF COURSE my painful loss of my pets, couldn't compare to the situation and issues created by her sister's horrific murder.

It wasn't a comparison saying they should suffer more or less, nor a judgement on the bond they had with the cat. It was all about how the friend was grieving and how they could approach working through that grief.\n\nGrief is grief. We morn the loss of all sorts of things, big or small. What you might find a small thing could mean a great deal to someone else and that doesn't make it less just because not everyone values it the same. Sometimes there aren't 'deeper' reasons. Sometimes even if there are other factors they aren't what's important to helping someone through a hard time.", "Isobel Crawley says this in Downton Abbey.\n\n\u201cBut, you see, when your only child dies, then you\u2019re not a mother anymore. You\u2019re not anything, really. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to get used to.\u201d\n\nI can't even bear to imagine the pain.", "Mine certainly are.  When I lost my beloved cat  Ripley, I was destroyed.  I adored her, and she was my constant loving companion.  We played together; she did her best to comfort me if I needed it; and her personality was uniquely hers.  When she declined and died due to fluid on her heart, it killed me to end her suffering.  The hole inside me was immense, and for two years I cried every time I thought of her.  It's been over 12 years now, but I can still get overwhelmed when I think if her."]}
