I had to put my oldest down this week and I am beyond devastated.\n\nBut there\u2019s no way I would ever EVER EVER tell a parent of a young child in that situation that these two things are somehow comparable. It has much less to do with dog = human being and more to do with actual empathy, where you don\u2019t try to somehow one-up the grieving parent or engage in some half-assed competitive victimization. That is some major WTF-ery.\n\nYou shut it down. Someone needed to, since she was obviously clueless.\n\nNTA.", "I love my dog and I love my son, but my dog is a dog and my son is  a human who will well outlive my dog. I respect people's choices on how they view their animals. Some people can't have kids and view their animals as that, but comparing surgery of an animal to one of a human is no where near the same. The outcomes are vastly different as well as recovery. Were you a bit rude? Perhaps, but NTA.", "NTA- Mary was taking away from the people who are actually struggling by making a comparison to her dog. I get she was probably trying to sympathize but it was an inappropriate comment to make and clearly made people uncomfortable. You were just trying to prevent it from getting worse by telling her to stop talking. \n\nWhy would you be responsible for mending the relationship with your Dad? He's the one who asked her to leave because of her comments. That didn't have anything to do with you", "NTA I love my dog. I love her fuzzy little butt. She brings me joy everyday. However, she's a dog. I am not a dog mom. I hate when people call me her Mommy, it makes my skin crawl.\n\nIf you don't know what to say to someone who is grieving the loss of a friend or family member not equating with your experience with your pet is common sense.", "NTA. I can confirm you are right, and acted correctly. \n\nYour brother's girlfriend comparing a sick dog to a sick child in front of the child's mother was deeply hurtful. While she may have had good intentions, she was very, very rude to equate a child's life with a household pet. Now she knows that comparison is inappropriate and offensive, and can hopefully correct her behaviour.", "What Mary said not just rude, it was deeply offensive.  It was good that you stood up for your family friend in that moment.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA. I grew up in a household with dozens of dogs. One of our dogs used to guard my little brother's crib at night, every night, while he was a toddler. Dogs are the absolute best, but what Mary said is just appalling and you were right to stop her from putting her foot in it further.", "NTA as a dog lover myself you were absolutely right its not the same. If this woman had a child herself she would've known that.", "Unless someone else in that room had been through the same situation where their child was dealing with medical issues and could possibly die, no one should've taken the opportunity to claim \"I know what you're going through\". The fact that Mary's story was about her dog just added insult to injury.\n\nI understand that it's really hard for people to just shut the f--- up and listen when people are grieving but we need to get better at it. Most of the time people are desperate to try to \"fix\" the situation by saying exactly the right thing that will make the grieving person feel better, but end up making themselves look like an ass. Because NOTHING they say or do is going to fix the situation or make that person feel better. Platitudes belittle their suffering. Comparisons are only for attention-seekers. If you really want to comfort someone who's mourning you tell them you're so sorry they're hurting, let them know you love them, and make a sincere and specific offer to help them (e.g. \"I go grocery shopping every Saturday afternoon. Can I text you that morning to ask for your shopping list and I can pick you up whatever you want?\"), not just the empty \"let me know if you need anything\" (they won't).\n\nMary doesn't sound malicious but her cluelessness only added to their suffering. Her feelings about her dog may be valid but trying to compare her experience to theirs is incredibly thoughtless. Normally, I'd say Mary should apologize but that just might make those parents feel worse as she'd be bringing up an already sensitive subject. I would just warn her to do what I suggested above instead of tactlessly trying to relate to something with which she has absolutely no experience.

It could make you look worse, not better.\n\nIf people keep mentioning it to you, explain that your outburst was a result of shock that she showed such disregard (as this was your instinctual interpretation) for a 9 year old child\u2019s life.", "NTA.

She might have felt similar grief about her dog. However I think comparing her dog with someone's son is still wrong. Here is why:\n\nFor the three hundred thousand years we've been petting dogs, from the start dogs were living as the part of the clan as protectors, and we fed them in return. There's a really sweet loyalty and love that they give us, and we give them as well.\n\nSome people tend to put a cat or a dog above averyone else due to some personal reasons. Those reasons aren't being a \"problem only white developed nation people could encounter\" but more of \"noone can love us more than them or their love is so pure\" reasons.\n\nSome people may see their dogs as best friends, some may see as their child. Still; An adult person should be able to understand that not everyone percieve their dogs the way they do. Therefore comparing her dog to someone's child is wrong and you're NTA.", "NAH Mary was trying to empathize by offering her own life experience, and for her that is her dog almost dying.

But as you said you don\u2019t understand how some people can care for pets as much as they do so you don\u2019t agree. \n\nEveryone needs to cool off and then have a calm conversation and move on. This isn\u2019t something worth staying mad or continually fighting about.", "Nta and I am one of those vile people who think it's wacky to save a stranger over your dog to whom you have an actual moral obligation to protect/care for.

Animals are wonderful, pets can give love and be \"like\" family - and neither should ever be abused. That said, no animal's life is worth any human's and especially a child's in the eyes of their parent. No one can change another's mind, the individual must do that for themself. But if a few years from now Mary has a child and is asked: \"if you heard a screech of brakes and a crash and you run outside to find your child and pet both dead, which would you be more upset about?\" if she answers \"pet\" she has not changed her mind and is indeed a bad person. No mentally stable parent would grieve more over a dead pet than a dead child. PERIOD.", "NTA. People who think pets\u2019 lives are equal to or more valuable than a human\u2019s are a whole different kind of delusional and antisocial.

If a pet parent had to choose between their dog whom they\u2019ve raised with love vs a random human stranger, they\u2019re going to choose their dog, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.

But the friend can handle those feelings or call it out herself. that\u2019s not your job. You were rude to Mary by invalidating her experience and also humiliating her in mixed company. Dogs might seem less important to YOU in the scheme of things, but to a lot of other people, animals are just as much part of the family as the other people in said family. I have a cat.

The family friend felt a certain way about that but Mary didn't make any statement about her dog being as important as a Human, just an example.\n\nI almost put YTA for this though because I feel like the parent of the sick kid was already on 10 during the conversation and did not express empathy herself for Mary whose dog also almost died.", "Mary was trying to be empathetic, albeit somewhat insensitive to others. It\u2019s true that a dog\u2019s life cannot be compared to a human life but sometimes a dog could have a big impact on someone\u2019s life and anything happening to them can be depressing for them.

She understands that you can have a bond with an animal that is as intense as a bond between two people.\n\nPersonally, I agree with Mary. But I know other people don't feel that way about animals.

Mary may have been trying to show she could relate, but it was insensitive and had the opposite effect. Demanding an apology shows she doesn't get it even now. You probably weren't the right person to step in and should have left it to your brother or parents.", "ESH - She was trying to be empathic, in a clumsy and ham-handed way, but she was trying.  You and your family lashed out in a pretty harsh manner, ordered her to leave and made it clear that you essentially despise her and her way of thinking.

I would have done something similar, but I would have asked Mary to step out of the room to do it.
