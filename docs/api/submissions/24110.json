It\u2019s in a small village and basically everyone knows everyone. My cousin (17F) came along as well)\n\nSo it happened that yesterday one of my mom\u2019s ex colleagues (she retired) was in the village. We knew she was from the same village as well so it wasn\u2019t a surprise that she and my mom come across one another. My mom invited her colleague to drink some coffee in our yard and the colleague brought her son(around 27ish). The colleague and I knew each other from before.\n\nI didn\u2019t know that they were there up until my mom called us with my cousin because her colleague wanted to see me. I went to them and as soon as we approached the three of them I hear \u201ccome on we don\u2019t eat people \u201c coming from her son and \u201cwhy did u choose to study in state ONE?\u201d from the colleague. It\u2019s important for the context to say that I will be a junior in college this autumn and I was accepted in several states , the most important of which are ONE and TWO. My choice was TWO due to personal reasons. \n\nWhen I get to them the colleague continues by saying \u201c You should have chosen state ONE because he (her son) has a 3-bedroom apartment and you could\u2019ve lived with him and wouldn\u2019t have paid for housing.\u201d \nEven tho I brushed the comment off as a  joke I felt really creeped out and when I shaked his hand the feeling of uncomfortableness got even stronger. The colleague continued with \u201cI\u2019ll be leaving him to u for a few days , u can go for a walks etc\u201d and I was like yeah yeah because I didn\u2019t know what else to say and both my mom, my friend and I thought it was a joke, or at least the offer was out of some sort of politeness and wasn\u2019t serious.\u201d \n\nAfter they left I explained to my mom how this whole situation really creeped me out and how uncomfortable I felt. My cousin was with me in that saying it was quite weird to set us up like that. Not only the age difference but the whole interaction was really weird. My mom said it was all jokes.\n\nIt was until an hour ago when the son came to search for us. I got really weirded out and just went to my room and locked it,5 minutes  after my mom tried to get in, I heard her apologising to him and saying we couldn\u2019t make it. \n\nI feel like an asshole, because I probably overthinked and overreacted. I feel really bad that he had leave without us hanging out but I couldn\u2019t help but think about yesterday. My mom says I took it too far and we could just hang out for 15 minutes with him and I think she might be right. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1691429054, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15kr1h7/aita_for_not_wanting_to_hang_out_with_my_moms/", "score": 287, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At the time I was about to head off for college and these kids were like 10/11 years old at most. I bust out laughing and said no, but my mom genuinely didn't understand what was so funny, like to her we were basically the same age. I explained to her that that would just be me and my sister babysitting and for the life of her she didn't understand how I reached that conclusion. And to be clear she wasn't just trying to trick us into babysitting, my mother thankfully does not have the competence to pull off a lie or a manipulation.
