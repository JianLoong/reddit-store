I thought you threw her out with no notice for bringing her new boyfriend to the house she shares with you.  You aren't. If I read correctly you are giving her three months notice to move out. Because she is bringing home guys she wants to bang. There is nothing wrong with her actions. Like you said, she is an adult. But you don't have to pass up the peaceful enjoyment of your home to make her happy.", "NTA-\nWho is brought into your house is 100% your business.", "NTA. She made it your business when she started bringing random guys home. It\u2019s your home, not hers. Time for her to move out.", "\\> ...until she got established with her education and a job\n\n\\> ...has completed her schooling. She got a job as an LPN\n\nNTA.  Seems like the conditions for the free ride have been met. \\*And\\* it's your house, so your rules whether she's an adult or not.", "NTA at all. You were incredibly kind and compassionate to let your ex-daughter in law live with you after your son passed away. Especially as they were already divorced before his passing and so there was a level of distance to your relationship with her. \n\nI\u2019m assuming she got too comfortable in the end but she should totally remember that you\u2019re doing her a favour and ultimately it\u2019s up to you who comes into your house! \n\nAlso sorry for your loss.", "NTA it\u2019s a safety issue and I get it and it\u2019s also a lifestyle issue and she has her opinion-so it\u2019s not working out for both of you. You\u2019re making the right move.", "NTA\n\nYou were generous to take them in and help them out, but now she has a job and can get her own place.  \n\nEspecially if she will not treat you and your house with respect.", "NTA. It's your home that you were kind enough to extend to her and your grandson. If she wants to date a lot of guys, good for her, but she should be able to go to their place, right? \n\nAll your asking is she not bring a bunch of random men you don't know in to your home, that's not unreasonable.", "NTA. Time for her to get her own place.", "NTA\u2026she\u2019s being completely disrespectful to your home. The sad part is that when she leaves your grandson is going to see the parade of panty party guests she brings home.", "NTA. She has the audacity to bring her hook ups into your home. You're giving her at least three months to find a new place and to make the transition.", "NTA. She's taking advantage of your kindness.  Living there was an offer you extended because it was a more stable environment for your grandson. \n\nShe can do whatever she wants...in her own house. Time for her to go.  Hope she stays close so you can keep tabs on your grandson.  He's going to need you.", "NTA, it's your house. She can move out if that's what she wants.", "NTA, you've propped up the woman your son divorced for 2 years! That's more than she should have expected to begin with! It's past time for her to move out and live her life somewhere outside of your home!", "NTA", "NTA it is your home & the condition of her staying there are no overnight guests.", "NTA. Your house, your rules.", "Her live in landlord says no overnight guests... She needs to go to her booty calls' homes.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It was a temporary arrangement. And you are right...you do have a right for her to not parade guys in. I\u2019m sure the conversation went off the rails due to your tone and aggressive verbiage. You could have suggested she spend time at their homes instead and you could watch your grandson. Instead you used harsh words and put her on the defense.", "NTA That\u2019s your home that you were letting her live in for free, you have every right to not accept strangers coming over. You\u2019re not telling her not to date or anything, just not to bring them to your home. Considering she has a child, she shouldn\u2019t be doing that anyway.", "She graduated school, has a job and was given at least 3 months notice. NTA. I suggest you look into local eviction proceedings to make sure everything is legal and on the level.", "NTA\n\nIt's pretty simple, while you are living here do not bring in men. She can go to their place or rent a room.", "NTA. You are being more than reasonable here.\n\nYou were a boon to her life, and she's gotten a little too comfortable at your house. Sounds like it's a good time for her get her own place.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like she was a teen mom? Where are her parents in this situation? It was very nice of you to take her in and your grandson. That's a lot of work for her to take care a a child, lose her ex-husband, finish school, and get a job. However, two years is enough time to make a plan to re-establish herself.\n\nI think it's a normal thing for anyone, even single moms, to want to find a partner. However, she's sowing her wild oats under your roof. I was a single mom after divorce and I had a period where I went through that. However, she should be respectful and discrete.\n\nIs she bringing them home when her child is in the house? That would be a big no-no.\n\nYou do have to keep in mind that if she moves out your grandson's life may suffer. Maybe you both can talk about not bringing people home.\n\nI think having her move out is a good idea if she can afford it. You might have to help her make a plan. There are also social services, welfare, food stamps, rental assistance, etc.\n\nHer son might even be able to stay in the school district. Our public schools allow us to make a special request to stay enrolled even if we move out of the district. They might not allow him to ride the bus, but if she can drive him to and from that might work.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
