However, two years is enough time to make a plan to re-establish herself.\n\nI think it's a normal thing for anyone, even single moms, to want to find a partner.

Maybe you both can talk about not bringing people home.\n\nI think having her move out is a good idea if she can afford it. You might have to help her make a plan. There are also social services, welfare, food stamps, rental assistance, etc.\n\nHer son might even be able to stay in the school district.

I said to get herself settled and established while not disturbing her sons school life and currently scheduled. Her dating life is a side point. I used her dating as an example of the fact that she's clearly got a lot going on and op offering to lighten the load might be seen as a blessing. I say this as i was the mom except i wasn't at my ex's moms house. I was at his uncles. I wasn't dating yet but i would have jumped if someone offered to help me in that way. I was having a mental moment. I didn't say she would absolutely accept either, but it never hurts to offer and my take on the info made me say what i said.\n\n\nEta- I'm also going off the fact that op didn't say she was bringing home dates, she was banging in her house and op doesn't want to hear it anymore. So please stop trying to vilify my words and arguing about dating when my original comment said nothing about her dating at all, i was commenting on her attitude towards ops stance on having her banging randoms in her house.", "It's a possible outcome that she leaves the house and is immediately hit by a bus.\nShould OP start planning to take on the legal guardianship of their orphaned grandson? \n\nOr should they work to the most likely scenario, that being the one that millions and millions of people manage to do where someone moves out and everyone just gets on with it?\n\nIt's not best for the child to drag them into an unnecessary and vitriolic custody battle without a damn good reason. She is not an unfit parent, not has OP claiming to have taken on the bulk of parental responsibility. \n\nIf she moves out, cuts OP off and refuses to ever let them see their grandson again, then unless they have been the primary caregiver, grandparents rights are not usually applicable.\n\nThreatening to use them is just driving conflict and the opposite of good advice.", "Why wouldn't OP consider what happened if she died? That's actually a really important thing that everyone involved should've considered since the kids has already lost one parent.\n\nAlso, absolutely no one said to threaten DIL. That would be the opposite of helpful. There's no reason to go to court if there's no reason to go to court. Driving conflict is not good for the child. Any requirement for OP to have been a primary caregiver is by no means universal. Like stated previously, it'll depend on where OP is."]}
