Again, it's your own choice, regardless of what that choice is.", "NTA.", "NTA. Honestly, I wouldn't even be sending care packages etc for people who enabled his abuse. I don't support abusers, nor their enablers. However, whatever you think is right for yourself, is how you should proceed. Block all the noise.", "NTA.  Your relationship to your father doesn't magically change because he is at the end of his life.  He sounds like a callous person based on his behavior.  You're totally justified in keeping any boundary you've established with him.  It's probably better for your mental health too.\n\nThe cleaning and help with meals you are doing for those who are grieving in your family is extremely kind.  I hope they appreciate it.", "NTA.

Anyone who tells you that you need to go see a criminal who hurt your mom is wrong on so many counts and they need to mind their own business. \n\nYou only need to do what you can live with and if you can live with your choice without regret, then that's the right decision. \n\nIt's also important to protect yourself and your mental health so if supporting family gets in the way of that, please make sure to continue advocating for yourself.", "So my Hubs was in a very similar situation only his dad had sole custody and beat the shit out of him until he realized he could swing back.\n\nHe did something for his own closure that impressed the shit out of me as his father lay dying, he unloaded. He told him every honest thing and how even on his deathbed he was a lying manipulative ass and he wanted him to go to the grave knowing full well he wasn't forgiven.", "NTA, but if he really is dying, you may regret not going later in life, it's not something you can do over. Just be accepting of that if you choose not to go.", "NTA. You do what you feel is best. It sounds like you're doing your best for your family members, and all that's left is taking care of yourself.", "nta. You don't owe anybody peace", "I dealt with all of those feelings years ago and have no need to confront him for any sort of closure. He is who he is. He was never going to change. I\u2019m just sad for my family who will be mourning his death.", "Several family members on that side of my family are telling me I need to visit him before he passes.", "That's normal when someone is dying. Those are conversations with irrelevant 3rd parties, not conflicts.\n\nYou clearly don't have the kind of relationship with your father that would warrant a deathbed visit.  But he isn't asking, so apparently he already knows.", "You do not have to go. I did not go. I do not regret it. There are no lingering feelings of \"oh no, I don't have closure.\" Like OP says, some of us deal with our shit, years before an abusive father passes away. My sister and I knew that he would just inject a final piece of poison, before he died. With abusive people (and especially addicts), it is all about them, never about you what you might need.\n\nWe also did not have a funeral or even pick up the body. This shocked people. But, not the people who knew what our childhood was like. We don't have to pretend for anyone. Anyone commenting that OP 'might regret it' either does not know what an abusive childhood was like, or has not done the work on themselves yet, to understand we do not owe our abusers a single thing.", "I don\u2019t even know why you would try to comfort someone like your brother who\u2019s stood by and agrees with a violent abuser\u2026", "NTA the only reason to go to the hospital to say \"Good bye\" is if it will make you feel better/ closure.", "NTA. I wasn't with my mum for the last week of her life (not a long story but too long for right now) and I love my mum to pieces. My brother and sister also weren't with her for their own separate reasons but we did all say the goodbyes we needed and she was with my dad and auntie so not alone. Which is to say even folks who have good relationships with parents they love dearly are not always there for their parents last moments and your father is, I'm afraid to say, reaping what he has sown in life. If you want to see him for some kind of closure there is no shame in that but you deserve to protect your inner peace from this man who has done nothing but cause distress to you. Biological relation does not mean you owe him anything. I hope you have the chance to heal and that your relatives buck up and leave you alone. Their grief journey does not give them the right to dictate what you do.", "OP=NTA\n\nYou absolutely do not have to see your father for his sake or your family's sake.  You seem kind-hearted to arrange care packages for family members in THEIR time of grief.", "NTA.  You are under no obligation especially with the circumstances you have explained to have to visit him.  He has not been a father to you.  It is no one\u2019s place to tell that you should visit, or bitch about that you are not visiting.  Your time is fir you and those you value.  Your father is not on that list.", "NTA\n\nMy father also committed criminal acts, needless to say he was cut out of my life at 17. \n\nHe cheated on my mom, among other things and moved to be with another woman. \n\nHe sent letters and gifts which went straight to the trash. Never opened them and never wanted to hear from him. \n\nWhen he died his current wife\u2019s daughter called me (no idea how she got the #) to let me know saying she thought I should know. I didn\u2019t know her so I gave her a courteous \u201cok thanks for letting me know goodbye\u201d, and then hung up. \n\nI really didn\u2019t care after what he did to our family. Therapy only fixes so much. \n\nDon\u2019t apologize to anyone for taking a stand for what you believe in. I\u2019m sure he did terrible things. \n\nI fully support your decision. \n\nDon\u2019t listen to your relatives.", "Nta", "NTA- I beleive, if it takes the threat of death for someone to apologize then it\u2019s not earnest. It\u2019s just something they want to make THEMESELVES feel better. And it sounds like he\u2019s not even wanting to make ammends. Fuck that. You do you boo boo.", "Nta", "I didn't go see my father when he was dying. It's been two years and I've yet to feel a regret. You won't either, and you're NTA.", "NTA, but I\u2019m you would be a bit of one if you did visit him in the hospital and play songs like \u201cDing dong the witch is dead\u201d", "nta you aren't obligated to have a relationship with someone who has harmed you or the ppl you love", "NTA. You have no obligation to see him, forgive him, or think of him. He made his own choices. Take care of yourself. And it's okay if you grieve the relationship you wish you'd had with him.", "Damn, that's what I should have done.", "That's impressive as hell, good for him!", "I love my brother. My father was very manipulative and charismatic, so my brother believed all of his lies and is still convinced my father never did any of those things and it\u2019s all some kind of big mixup or conspiracy. I\u2019m not going to fault him for his relationship with my father. We\u2019ve fought about it enough through the years (him disagreeing with my decision not to have a relationship, and me trying to get him to acknowledge what my father had done). He is never going to see who our father really is. Maybe it\u2019s denial, maybe it\u2019s just too hard to admit that our father \u2014who he idolizes\u2014 is a bad person and rather than dealing with the dissonance of loving someone who\u2019s done such awful things, it\u2019s easier to stay in denial so he can love his father without that internal conflict. I\u2019m not going to fault him for that.", "I was SHOCKED then I sent his Therapist a plate of cookies.", "It\u2019s a really hard truth to swallow and some people simply cannot go through it. Do what you feel is best. You will not be the ah for it.", "What I had the hardest time with was the genuine compassion from friends and colleagues.
