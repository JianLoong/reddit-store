He blames my sister and me for our father\u2019s death saying he\u2019s \u201cdying of a broken heart.\u201d Meanwhile, our father has A-fib, habitually used narcotics, and refused to disclose his narcotic use when he was admitted for a cardiac event, which can lead to fatal drug interactions. \n\nI want to comfort my brother and my grandmother and other family members during this time, and am making plans to make their lives easier during this time (I\u2019ve put together care packages with DoorDash and Instacart gift cards as well as hired a friend who\u2019s a cleaning lady to clean their homes for them over the next couple of weeks). I just have no desire to be by my father\u2019s bedside while he dies. I have no relationship with him. He\u2019s not a person I even want to be associated with. So, AITA?\n\nEdit for clarification: A handful of family members are telling me I need to go say goodbye to him because he\u2019s my father and should have me by his side in his last moments and are calling me an asshole for not going.

Your relationship to your father doesn't magically change because he is at the end of his life.  He sounds like a callous person based on his behavior.  You're totally justified in keeping any boundary you've established with him.  It's probably better for your mental health too.\n\nThe cleaning and help with meals you are doing for those who are grieving in your family is extremely kind.  I hope they appreciate it.", "NTA.

But that's just what I'd do / the more cruel option, honestly. \n\nI'd let him know he's been a horrific father, that you wish you could've loved him, but instead he chose to be (presumably) violent and selfish.
