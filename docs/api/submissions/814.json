I shouldn't have done that, like everyone here said, I should have just offered her a ride, found her another ride, or told her I was leaving. I was so embarrassed and angry that I just didn't want to be around her anymore so I left quietly. Thanks to a kind redditor, I believe I may have some self-esteem and anger issues I need to work out, so I have scheduled a meeting with my campus counselor, and maybe get some professional therapy after that.\n\nNow on Friday afternoon I texted my friend Tina to talk so we can finally clear the air. She agreed and we met at her dorm. I apologized for leaving her at the party and not telling her I was leaving. She said that she is still pretty mad about leaving her in an unsafe situation when she was drunk. I told her I was upset at what I felt was her perceived revulsion. She apologized and said that she shouldn't have made me feel so unattractive. She said that because I'm like her brother, she would never find me attractive, but that doesn't mean other girls don't. I told her that I don't care if she did find me attractive, I was just upset with the tone. She said she understood, after I left one of our friends told her that she kinda went overboard with it and she really regretted how she said it. She apologized again, and I apologized again for leaving her. We admitted that we're not super happy with each other at the moment and are going to take some time apart to sort out our feelings(not romantic) toward each other. If we run into each other we're not gonna be awkward, and we might even text. But no hanging out like we were before.\n\nAnd that's it. Not a particularly happy update, but I guess it's better than nothing right? Thanks to all the redditors who helped me through this little mini-saga. I guess I'll see you all in therapy.", "created_utc": 1667325644, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjfyhn/update_aita_for_leaving_my_friend_at_a_party/", "score": 1340, "replies": ["It's happy in the sense that both of you realized that you had something to apologize for and both of you did apologize.

You guys are both very humble and mature people to be able to be civil in this kind of conflict. Good on you.\n\nAlso, it didn't seem like you have any apprehensions about this but I just want to say that seeing a campus counselor my freshman year of college was my first experience with therapy and it was seriously life changing to just have someone to talk without judgment and with complete privacy (I'm a man, and I have never felt comfortable enough talking with any of my friends as candidly as I could with a therapist).

You should\u2019ve at least notified her you were leaving / given her a chance to tag along.  BUT - alcohol explains situations, not justifies them - all lowering your inhibitions does is bring a raw form of your truth to the surface, IMO.  She made your response feel more reasonable by her actions - but it\u2019s still super shitty to give someone the OK to drink, then disappearing - if I knew my ride was leaving I could start sobering up or look for a plan B.  It\u2019s exactly as you said, it\u2019s not what, but how you said things.

Tone matters and there\u2019s a reason the phrase \u201cit\u2019s not what you said, it\u2019s how you said it\u201d exist.

Are you saying women have no agency and need to be protected by a man constantly?\n\nHonestly, this is the most sexist take on there internet I\u2019ve seen in a long time:\n\n \u201cWomen must constantly be protected when they drink because they cannot take care of themselves, and mutual friends at the party will drug and rape them because they are men.\u201d \n\nGo white knight elsewhere and stop being sexist.", "If you can't control what you say to your friends when you drink... then you shouldn't be drinking.  \n\nAlcohol is not an excuse to be am asshole, and it's not a free pass to shit on your friends with no consequences.

If, as a person, you know you struggle with this, don't make it a problem.", ">but that also means he was there to make sure she stays safe.\n\nNo, that is not what DD means. I agree that women need to be way more careful when they're out drinking, but that doesn't mean their friends are obligated to monitor them the entire evening. A DD specifically stays sober in order to drive; it's not a tacit agreement to be 100% responsible for the well-being of inebriated adults beyond driving them as agreed. Obviously friends should step in if they realize something bad is happening, but what you're describing is closer to a babysitter than a DD.\n\nI do think that, as DD, OP *was obligated* to at least tell his friend that he was leaving and that she'd have to make other transport arrangements, but that's it. It was in no way his responsibility to hang around and ensure her safety *at the party*, and as a woman who likes to occasionally go out drinking I honestly find that take infantilizing. Nobody, regardless of gender is entitled to get inebriated to to point of incapacitation and expect to be taken care of. It would literally never occur to me to expect that of my friends or even a boyfriend regardless of whether they agreed to DD. OP didn't kick her out on the side of the road or callously leave with the expectation that she would be victimized. He *should have* given her a head's up that he was leaving, but putting any possible bad outcome of those circumstances on OP is wild.", "So the fact that she insulted him, whether it was inadvertently or not, gives her the right to a ride home with the person who she insulted?\n\nNope. If it had been a girl who had been insulted by her guy friend to this sub would of been completely backing her and calling him an asshole.", "I love the hypocrisy. Women are independent adults. But also they need to be chaperoned by the closest male person.\n\n>but that also means he was there to make sure she stays safe.\n\nLol no.", "She was left with a group of friends so how was she in a dangerous situation.

What if she told everyone how ugly and worthless OP is while telling everyone she can treat him how she wants and he can't do shit about it?\n\nWould it be okay then for OP to act in his own best interest and remove himself from her space? Or is his duty to give her a ride no matter what she says, does, etc...?", "OP didn't increase the risk.  The friend did.  OP is under no obligation, moral or otherwise, to continue to come to the aid of someone who degrades and abuses him.\n\nUnless the point of your post is that men should be doormats for any and all women in their lives, because being a woman's friend apparently obligates you to come to their rescue and fix their shit for them forever.", "Then she shouldn\u2019t have gotten drunk.   His feelings matter too.", "I've never again spoken to (ex) friends after dropping them at home, but I would never leave a drunk person stranded I was responsible for if I was DD.", "Maybe if they\u2019d gone to a part organized by OP\u2019s friends or an unknown place, I could see that, but it sounds like they had a bunch of mutual friends, so she had a couple of people she could stick around with for the rest of the night and ask them for a ride or until she could call an Uber or something.\n\nOP had no obligation to stick around, after being insulted like that, although I do think he should\u2019ve at least given her a heads up that he was leaving.\n\nThey\u2019re both adults.

The amount of people who think they would respond in a sugary sweet way to being put on the spot while drunk and asked if they would date a male friend does make me wish people would confront them at parties to ask if they would date Steve/Michael/whatever their best male friend is called just to see if they actually would.", "Oh I\u2019m not just talking about girls.
