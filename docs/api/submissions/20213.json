It was bad enough I was losing mine, having my mom be bald too wasn\u2019t going to help. I suppose it\u2019s meant to be a nice gesture but it doesn\u2019t really do anything for the sick person. Visit her, bring her hard candies to help with the nausea, hold the puke bucket if she gets sick. Bring her her favorite flavor milkshake. Tell her stories to distract her. These will be the things that make a huge difference in her healing journey.", "NTA\n\nI mean... You said in another comment your moms not shaving her head, and it's your hair. Plus, as someone who has had family with cancer(two separate people), and had others shave their hair while they went through chemo... They would never force anyone to do it, because it's not their hair! It's nice to show that support but it is in no way necessary.", "NTA\n\nI'm betting this has nothing to do with your aunt, and more because they don't like long hair on boys.", "NTA.\n\nIf your parents aren't doing it, they have no leg to stand on.

I only met people who did this as a voluntary show of solidarity with the patient. Never met a patient who insisted on it, though. If your parents are pressuring you, that's not cool. If they're not doing it themselves, why are they forcing you to do it? So they can show the world what great parents they think they are, that they raised an empathetic son? Sounds like the grandstanding a lot of people do around cancer patients without asking them what they really want people to do to help them. If you want to show solidarity with your aunt-- and it's your idea-- ask her if she needs you to bring her any of her favorite things in the hospital. Spend time with her. You'll think of something, anything, more meaningful than hair.", "NTA.  Your dad is bald and your mother isn't going to shave her head; they have no business pressuring you into doing something they can't or won't do themselves.", "No no no. Just no. This whole thing about shaving heads in solidarity feels, on paper, like a thoughtful gesture, but it really just amounts to a performative act. There are so many other ways you can support your aunt that don't involve shaving your head. Also, is your aunt asking this of you? Does she want you to do this? Because there are cancer patients who don't lose their hair, and there are cancer patients who don't like to see their loved ones shaved heads because it's a reminder that they are dealing with cancer. Don't feel pressured to do anything you don't want to do. Just be there for her and support in her in the ways that she needs. Good luck!  \n\n\nETA: Definitely NTA", "Info are you parents also going to shave their heads?", "NTA I've never understood how someone  else's bald head helped any of the nausea from chemo,  or the crying alone that you are leaving you family, or the dread of hearing the results from your latest test.", "LOL this is like some curb your enthusiasm shit when everybody wanted Larry to donate a kidney. You're NTA!! It's your hair. That sucks that your aunt has cancer, but there's a million other ways to support her.

It isn't always, and especially not if done in a performative, \"Look at me!\" kind of way.\n\nThere are probably a dozen or more other ways you can support your great aunt, that don't involve shaving your head.\n\nA number of people said to me \"If you need anything...\", but I still felt uncomfortable asking anyone to do anything. If you've always prided yourself on your independence, it's not easy to ask for help.\n\nIt would have been easier if they'd said something specific: \"I'm here. What do you need, that I can do? A ride to hospital? Some home-made meals for your freezer? A couple of loads of laundry done? House cleaned?

In fact shaving your head because someone has cancer is weird. You aren't losing your hair because you are going through treatments, you aren't feeling the pain and getting sick everyday because of the chemo.  You are volunteerly shaving your head which will grow back. \n\nThe whole shave my head in solidarity thing to me is so narcissistic and attention grabbing away from the person who has cancer.

The person fighting cancer is bald bald for the duration while all the people who shave their head rock adorable pixie cuts.  3) The experience of losing your hair from cancer is deeply traumatic (if you don't shave, the klumps of lost hair hanging up in the existing hair coming out in balls; if you do shave the weird bare patches till you go completely hairless; your eyebrows and eyelashes suddenly being gone and suddenly realizing how puffy your face is from meds) and electing to shave your head and solidarity is not similar in any way.  4) as my daughter pointed out repeatedly \"I have enough change going on in my life in the last thing I needed to look at everyone I know with a buzz cut.\"", "NTA.
