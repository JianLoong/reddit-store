No is a complete sentence. It doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t love or support her. Ask them to drop the topic.", "No. As someone who has had her head shaved multiple times for neurosurgery, I had people offer many times and my response was always no. It was bad enough I was losing mine, having my mom be bald too wasn\u2019t going to help. I suppose it\u2019s meant to be a nice gesture but it doesn\u2019t really do anything for the sick person. Visit her, bring her hard candies to help with the nausea, hold the puke bucket if she gets sick. Bring her her favorite flavor milkshake. Tell her stories to distract her. These will be the things that make a huge difference in her healing journey.", "NTA\n\nI mean... You said in another comment your moms not shaving her head, and it's your hair. Plus, as someone who has had family with cancer(two separate people), and had others shave their hair while they went through chemo... They would never force anyone to do it, because it's not their hair! It's nice to show that support but it is in no way necessary.", "NTA\n\nI'm betting this has nothing to do with your aunt, and more because they don't like long hair on boys.", "NTA.\n\nIf your parents aren't doing it, they have no leg to stand on. There are plenty of ways to show support beyond mimicking the **possible** side effects of chemo.", "You're NTA, dude. I used to work on a cancer ward. I only met people who did this as a voluntary show of solidarity with the patient. Never met a patient who insisted on it, though. If your parents are pressuring you, that's not cool. If they're not doing it themselves, why are they forcing you to do it? So they can show the world what great parents they think they are, that they raised an empathetic son? Sounds like the grandstanding a lot of people do around cancer patients without asking them what they really want people to do to help them. If you want to show solidarity with your aunt-- and it's your idea-- ask her if she needs you to bring her any of her favorite things in the hospital. Spend time with her. You'll think of something, anything, more meaningful than hair.", "NTA.  Your dad is bald and your mother isn't going to shave her head; they have no business pressuring you into doing something they can't or won't do themselves.", "No no no. Just no. This whole thing about shaving heads in solidarity feels, on paper, like a thoughtful gesture, but it really just amounts to a performative act. There are so many other ways you can support your aunt that don't involve shaving your head. Also, is your aunt asking this of you? Does she want you to do this? Because there are cancer patients who don't lose their hair, and there are cancer patients who don't like to see their loved ones shaved heads because it's a reminder that they are dealing with cancer. Don't feel pressured to do anything you don't want to do. Just be there for her and support in her in the ways that she needs. Good luck!  \n\n\nETA: Definitely NTA", "Info are you parents also going to shave their heads?", "NTA I've never understood how someone  else's bald head helped any of the nausea from chemo,  or the crying alone that you are leaving you family, or the dread of hearing the results from your latest test.", "LOL this is like some curb your enthusiasm shit when everybody wanted Larry to donate a kidney. You're NTA!! It's your hair. That sucks that your aunt has cancer, but there's a million other ways to support her. Maybe just lie and say you're growing it out to donate to locks of love LOL.", "NTA. This gesture isn\u2019t meaningful if it\u2019s coerced. No is a polite, complete sentence.", "Former cancer patient here. \n\nNTA. You are not a piece of shit.\n\nIf your great aunt feels incredibly self-conscious about losing her hair, then having friends or family members prepared to shave their head as an act of solidarity *can* be helpful.\n\nNote I said \"can be\". It isn't always, and especially not if done in a performative, \"Look at me!\" kind of way.\n\nThere are probably a dozen or more other ways you can support your great aunt, that don't involve shaving your head.\n\nA number of people said to me \"If you need anything...\", but I still felt uncomfortable asking anyone to do anything. If you've always prided yourself on your independence, it's not easy to ask for help.\n\nIt would have been easier if they'd said something specific: \"I'm here. What do you need, that I can do? A ride to hospital? Some home-made meals for your freezer? A couple of loads of laundry done? House cleaned? Just say the word, I'm ready to help.\"\n\nPractical help like this is likely to be worth any amount of performative head-shaving. Stand your ground and don't let your parents bully you into it.", "Info: Why do they want you to shave your head? How is that going to help your aunt? Does your aunt require this?", "Edit after seeing other replies\n\nNTA\n\nEven if they were doing it, if your mom won't commit, her opinion isn't relevant, and dad's already there. Support your aunt with your TIME, and ignore your parents commentary.", "NTA - why would you need to shave your head in the first place? If this is some form of weird \"show unity\" thing ... Say no, you are not obligated to do anything", "NTA, no point in doing it for virtue signaling.", "Nah don\u2019t. Grow it out for another year THEN cut it off and make a wig for her", "NTA. You can show love and support without lopping your locks", "NTA.\nAs someone who has been through chemo, I don't get the everyone should shave their head thing.\n\nIf it's something you want to do great, but there are much more practical ways you could support your aunt.\nFor instance - a silk pillow case is amazing when your hair is falling out.\n\nI also had a little sandwich bag that I took everywhere with me - it had lip balm, hand sanitizer, breath mints, licorice (it helped with the weird taste) I  know others that used life savers etc You could make something like that a put your own touch on it.\n\nDepending on your schedule you could sit with her during chemo, Cook some meals for her, offer to clean her house.\n\nAnyway the point is there are so many practical ways you can help and shaving of heads doesn't really help  anyone.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDON'T do it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: **Have your parents shaved THEIR heads?**", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

In fact shaving your head because someone has cancer is weird. You aren't losing your hair because you are going through treatments, you aren't feeling the pain and getting sick everyday because of the chemo.  You are volunteerly shaving your head which will grow back. \n\nThe whole shave my head in solidarity thing to me is so narcissistic and attention grabbing away from the person who has cancer.

When a person is going through chemo and will lose their hair, sometimes other people in the family will shave their head as a sign of solidarity, and presumably so the person that lost their hair doesn't have to feel different in what could be a stressful time overall and when they don't need to feel insecure about their appearance on top of it.", "Some families will shave their head during chemo to show their support and make them feel better about possible balding.", "Ding ding \ud83d\udece\ufe0f", "Then they are hypocrites and need to shut up.", "Well why should your mom pressure you if she won't? NTA But it's pretty messed up your mother is guilting you into doing something they themselves would never think to do.
