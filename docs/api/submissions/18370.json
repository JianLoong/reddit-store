Would they even bother for an alcohol abuser?", "NTA. It isn\u2019t up to him to decide where to stay and you need your space as an adult. As for the donation, it\u2019s not like donating a kidney, liver grows back so there\u2019s no harm in that imo.", "NTA \n\neven if he was the best father on the planet, you are under no obligation to donate parts of your body to other people.", "Tbh if he\u2019s actively still drinking if/when he needs a new liver. Likelihood is he won\u2019t be eligible for transplant as they don\u2019t usually if someone is just going to pickle the new one.", "NTA - Most places won't even accept organ donation of the recipient is an addict. What's the point wasting a good chunk of healthy liver if they are just going to drink it away? At this point, the likelihood your dad will ever want to or be able to recover from his addiction is virtually none, so don't stress out too much about organ donation.  I think in some places you can also tell the surgeons you are being pressured by family to donate, and they will say you are not a match to get them off your back (with checking that out though...)\n\nAs to the nursing home... Well, again, not likely you could look after him even if you wanted to. Looking after a severely ill addict with organ failure is beyond home care, and that's where he's heading.  So don't torture yourself.  In life, your priorities should be Yourself > Your children > Your partner > Everyone else. By that I don't mean that you get out of doing anything even mildly unpleasant for yourself. But if doing something is going to severely hurt your mental health to the benefit of someone else, you don't do it. \n\nIgnore your family. If you can't, step back from them. If you can't, offer up their services whenever they suggest you do it. \"Oh auntie, you know I've been looking into it and there's a strong chance I'm not a match. So good to know that you and uncle would we willing to step in if that's the case. Dad will be thrilled to know there's 3 people willing to donate their liver to him\". \n\nCan guarantee you that'll shut them up.", "NTA - I had a very complicated relationship with my father growing up and I chose to not go and see him or spend anytime with him when he was at end of life. Yet for my Mother, I was there as much as I could be until she passed. If my father had wanted to be cared for, and his bedside surrounded by loving family when he was dying, he should have acted better IN life.\n\nAlso - if his liver does fail him and he's been abusing alcohol his whole life, there is no way he'd be put on a donor list and you're under NO obligation to offer to be a donor either. There's more of a chance that any sort of surgery like that would be too risky for him and wouldn't be approved. Mine was also an alcoholic.\n\nEdited because I can't spell.", "NTA if that\u2019s what you choose to do. What sucks is you sound like you wear your heart 0n your sleeve. Mental health is extremely important but regret can fuel it as well. To ask this on a platform you are questioning it. I wouldn\u2019t give him a new liver that\u2019s not fair. To be with him while he goes through his last chapter of his life maybe you should.", "WNBTA. Sounds like he will probably need one though. I am guessing he's about to be diagnosed with Hepatopulmanary syndrome. Liver fails so much that the lungs have to pick up the pace, forming shunts around the lungs to hold the weight of it all, which means the oxygen cells that usually would go in to the lungs aren't all going to the lungs, they are surpassing the lungs completely due to going through the shunts instead which means more CO2 in the body than Oxygen, its usually ONLY found in adults in liver failure due to alcoholism. If he's sick, this may be what he has. If you're weighing with guilt about something that may happen in the future maybe find a way to get him checked out to see if he can be diagnosed with HPS, medicine can help longevity, and if he denies the help, then you'll know you tried. He may realize then that he needs to fix himself or it may be too late. Either way WNBTA, just trying to help your possible future guilt. :)", "NTA - And you only have one liver.", "NTA", "NTA they are just preemptively telling everyone they are not going to help him", "NTA. Not giving an organ is not abandoning someone. It isn't the same as refusing medication,  it's a major surgery and risks your life.  He likely wouldn't be a good candidate if he hasn't stopped drinking. The only way he would get your liver is if you were the one persistent to give him one.", "NTA. If you go to your doctor and tell them what you told us - that your father wants you to donate but you don't want to - they will tell your family that you are not a match.", "NTA. But I\u2019m confused as to why anyone in the family would make comments about him \u201cbeing lucky to have a daughter who should likely be a match\u201d. That\u2019s horrendous to say especially if you actually hear them. \n\nHis life choices have nothing to do with you being his organ \u2018savior\u2019 later on down the road. And what about them? Just being his daughter doesn\u2019t necessarily make you an ideal match. Anyone else planning on seeing if they match? Probably not. \n\nHe\u2019s lucky you\u2019re even still in his life and organ donation is definitely a lot to ask of anyone, let alone a person that was traumatized, repeatedly. This entire situation is a lot to unpack, but don\u2019t ever feel like you owe your father anything and remember that whatever options you choose, you are the only one who has to live the decisions.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nIf you want to save yourself the heat from others who aren't being asked to undergo a high risk operation to donate a body part. Lie. Pretend to be willing, go do the testing and tell the doctor what's going on and they'll put you down as not a match. People who don't want to donate organs are not a match full stop. \n\nDon't be afraid to lie to protect yourself if needs be.\n\nBy all means, dump him in a nursing home.", "NTA - I wouldn\u2019t based on the past history if it were me", "NTA. Doctors will not do organ transplants on patients that have not made healthy changes to stop further damage. So for example, a smoker will not get a lung transplant without quitting. So If he's still drinking, they will not give him a liver. \n\nYou're relatives are total A H**** for even bringing it up. You should side eye them and keep your distance. I'm getting toxic vibes from \"don't worry we can always harvest YOUR organs if need be\"... So creepy. Who even says that?", "NTA. He's family, but he sort of made that bed and now has to sleep in it. Can't go around abusing others and then be surprised when they don't want to help you later down the road.", "Not the asshole at all, you had to suffer his abuse for years now he can face the consequences of his own poor choices.", "NTA. If it makes you feel better, it doesn\u2019t sound like your father would qualify for a transplant anyway. I\u2019m a transplant nurse and the criteria is strict. Also, if it makes you feel any better, living donor liver transplants rarely go well since they only give a portion of the organ. He\u2019d be better off with a deceased donor if he cleaned up enough to qualify.", "NTA\n\nHe destroyed his liver, why should you give up yours for his mistakes? He failed to be a parent too, why would he even deserve it. Older folks always want to pin up 'family' as being this helpline that has to help each other with whatever happens just because you are blood. Screw that, your family is who you consider to be your family, just because they are blood doesn't mean you owe them anything.", "NTA. If family complains you won\u2019t let him live with you (which you 100% shouldn\u2019t given y\u2019all\u2019s past), tell them they are welcome to take him in and if they aren\u2019t willing to let him live with them, then they need to shut up.", "NTA- he\u2019s lucky you aren\u2019t NC (personally I think it would be healthier for you if you were) as for the liver\u2026why give him your healthy one when he\u2019s never changed his habits and will just destroy this one? They are planning to use you because he will get denied being put on a donor list due to his ongoing alcoholism. It\u2019s not your responsibility to care for him, especially since he never cared for you.", "An organ donation is not trimming your nails - it\u2019s a serious surgery, with potential complications. You don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want to. And frankly, anybody who tries to force/coerce/guilt you into it can go F themselves.\nNTA for not wanting to take care/donate to someone who was abusive to you your entire childhood and adolescence, even if now by some miracle you can have civil conversation and visit.", "NTA\nYou owe no one an organ, and you have no requirement to be the caretaker of an abuser.", "If you have end stage liver disease in the US most states require 6 mo sobriety before you are eligible\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA do not donate an organ unless you want to. You do not need to financially or physically care for your abuser.", "NTA.  You are not obligated to spend your time as care nurse for your abuser.  Donating an organ is also not to be taken lightly as it will effect your future quality of life.  As others have said talk to a doctor and tell them you are being pressured and harassed and you don't want to donate so they will list you as an unsuitable matcg", "NTA, but you might also want to check out r/alanon or some meetings.", "Also, would they even allow her father to get a transplant if he still has a drinking problem? \n\nRegardless,  OP is NTA.  She doesn't need to do anything for the man who terrorized her childhood.", "Please specify country! But this sounds like the best approach. NTA of course, OP. But please tell him NOW that you won't let him move in when he's old and frail. He probably won't prepare either way, just to have a clear conscience. I'd write it down too, email or something so you have proof he's been forewarned.", "Yes, the liver is an organ that regenerates. So a person donates part of their liver and it should regenerate itself on the donor and recipient.", "Yes, a half liver will regenerate in about a year. No. For any transplant, you must be compliant with the treatment plan and you have to take anti rejection medications for the rest of your life. You have many appointments and are expected to take care of that organ. There is always more need than there are organs, and insurance won't pay if the person was noncompliant going into surgery.", "Nope. You can\u2019t drink, chew tobacco, smoke, etc for donation. At least not where I\u2019m from. Relative needs a kidney transplant and that\u2019s part of the criteria. They WILL refuse you if you do those things.", "Not if he wants to get on the transplant list, but private donation usually let's certain patients bypass recovery steps, and sometimes that organ is just wasted."]}
