{"id": 27470, "submission_id": "16q6m3u", "title": "AITA for the comment I made after my brother-in-law insulted my career?", "selftext": "I (22F) am a teacher. I came home from school yesterday in not the best mood, and my fianc\u00e9, \u201cJake\u201d (25M) immediately noticed I wasn\u2019t acting like myself. He asked me what happened and although I didn\u2019t really go into too much detail, I told him it was a rough day at work. Then Jake\u2019s brother, \u201cDaniel\u201d (31M), who is currently staying with us,  chimed into the conversation from across the room. He said that I didn\u2019t have a right to complain because teachers are glorified babysitters, and that if I had a \u201creal job\u201d maybe he\u2019d understand. \n\nNormally, I try to brush these comments off, and honestly at first, I wasn\u2019t sure if he was kidding, so I gave him the opportunity to repeat what he said, but he was serious. The second time, he added that he didn\u2019t understand why I didn\u2019t want to do something \u201cmeaningful and productive\u201d with my life. At this point, Jake was getting pretty upset listening to this happen. He and Daniel have a very tumultuous relationship that they were recently working on, but he told Daniel that if he continues to speak to me that way he would have to leave our house. \n\nIt is also important to add here that Daniel works really long hours in a hospital, has a 2 year old daughter, and has commented previously about how he wishes he had more time to spend with her. In the moment with my frustration. I responded to Daniel\u2019s  comments by saying, \u201cat least I get to spend every holiday and summer with my family, that\u2019s what is meaningful and productive to me.\u201d\n\nDaniel stormed out, and shortly after I felt really bad about what I\u2019d said. I asked Jake if I should text Daniel and apologize or wait for him to come back and do it in person. Jake said that I\u2019m NTA, and that Daniel needs to be the first one to apologize to me. Jake even went as far as to say that if I did not receive an apology, Daniel would not be at our wedding, which I think might be a bit extreme. I can see both sides here. Daniel did start the argument, and enter a conversation that wasn\u2019t about him to begin with quite aggressively, but I\u2019m now unsure if my comments were out of line. AITA? Should I apologize to Daniel?", "created_utc": 1695481042, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16q6m3u/aita_for_the_comment_i_made_after_my_brotherinlaw/", "score": 647, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Teachers are the most important profession in our society. Without teachers, there would be no other professions, and we pay and treat teachers like garbage. People like Daniel need to be put in their place at every opportunity possible. \n\nAnd, at the very least, Daniel is a guest in your home and, as such, needs to be treating his hosts with a certain level of respect and manners.", "Daniel is rude. \n\nYou are NTA.  Daniel is.", "Based on what I read, Daniel is living in your home with you and your fianc\u00e9? If so, he shouldn\u2019t insult one of the people who has provided a place for him to live.

Daniel is certainly under a lot of stress but that doesn't excuse his dreadful comments.", "Info: he works long hours at a hospital? Am I right in assuming he has sort of higher education? You would think he would have more respect for those who sat around \u2018babysitting\u2019 him for a couple of decades while he taught himself how to read and count so that he could get that degree.

I will NEVER understand people that downplay the importance of teachers, and how hard their job really is. There are one million things that factor into the success of your classroom, and it's your responsibility to juggle them all. At one time. That is no small feat! Not to mention that teachers get paid and treated like shit for the INCREDIBLE amount of work they do.\n\nWhat Daniel said to you was unacceptable, and while I don't think that justifies the hurtful comment you retaliated with, he is also a *guest in your home.* You had every right to defend yourself. If he doesn't like teachers, he doesn't have to be one, but putting down your extremely challenging career is out of line.", "NTA. If Daniel wants to belittle your career choice and question why you would do it, there's no reason not to tell him the reason, even if it bothers him.\n\nEven if his \"glorified babysitter\" comment had merit (it doesn't), I would love to see him babysit 20-30 kids at the same time.", "NTA\n\nIt will be interesting when his daughter is school age, and what high expectations Daniel will have for the \u201cglorified babysitters.\u201d", "NTA, Daniel is a.. asshole. Dont apologize to him, and I hope you can get over your feeling of guilt for snapping back.", "NTA, I work at an elementary school, I know how hard the days can be and I personally feel that teachers have some of the most \"meaningful and productive\" jobs ever.

You aren't an A H outright but did say some shitty things to inflict emotional pain.\n\nDaniel is an A H for disrespecting you in your own home AND for disrespecting your profession.\n\nTaunting your vacations isn't going to make him respect your job though. Honestly you should talk to him calmly about educating kids, teaching them social skills, managing 30 kids at once and leading them/keeping them on track. I don't know the age of the kids you deal with but explaining the value of teaching someone to read, the principals of logic/math, of how the world works (science) etc. Would probably go alot further with this person.", "ESH.

Don't apologize to a bully.", "I\u2019m going against the grain here and saying ESH.\n\nTo be clear, you\u2019re not an ah for speaking up for yourself and putting him in his place but rather the specific weapon you used to attack back. The time spent with kids wasn\u2019t the argument, his attitude towards your profession was. Yours was a lower blow. I would not be adding you as an ah if you had used something like \u2018you\u2019re dismissing the people that got you where you are\u2019 or \u2018sorry my day isn\u2019t full of blood and ivs\u2019 etc. Without knowing his specific hospital job I can\u2019t provide a super good comeback (he could be in environmental or maintenance for all I know).\n\nI think it goes without saying why he is an asshole, but he completely is. Just what insult you used to respond is the thing here that made me think you sunk to his level.\n\nHe absolutely needs to apologize, but I do think you do too with an emphasis on the words you used not to intent to stick up for yourself.", "NTA \n\nAnd your soon to be hubs is a hero for herding your back", "NTA. I don't care if you're a stripper or another denigrated profession, who the hell is he to come into your home and criticize your career??!! And tell you to do something meaningful --who the hell says that?!  Throw him out and never look back. Don't apologize because that would only encourage this kind of ridiculous behavior.", "NTA and you are an angel for even considering to apologize. However I would also say that you might be a bit of a people pleaser because of that. Now I don't really know you outside of this interaction you described but talk to your fiance and if this is a recurring behavior maybe you did work on being less passive. Because while it's good that you stood up for yourself its not good that you feel guilty about it", "Soft ESH, leaning towards NTA.\n\nBrother is wayyyy out of line here, obvi. Your comment was also very hurtful though. I understand the retort but you may have been better served going another route.\n\nI think you may have partially sacrificed the moral high ground here. Like initially, you were very clearly wronged and in the right. You still are, but your position is somewhat weaker now after that comment.", "You snapped something you knew would be hurtful after finding out your future brother-in-law didn't respect your career. That makes both of you assholes. He should apologize, and you should as soon as he does.", "Nta Daniel is a nob. Can he read? Yes? Thank a teacher.", "Ok, I\u2019m here to stand up for you and every single teacher out there who spends his/her work days dealing with troubled kids, belligerent parents, and leadership that forgets what it\u2019s like to teach. Something \u201cmeaningful and productive\u201d he says?!! Teachers spend their lives educating the next generation, preparing our young people to be doctors, artists, tradespeople, farmers, musicians, engineers, academics\u2026virtually every single occupation that keeps our society going. I can\u2019t think of a single occupation that is more meaningful and productive. \n\nDaniel needs to zip it and apologize.

And Daniel needs to be shown the door out.  It's time to reconsider a whole lot of things here, including whether or not there actually will be this wedding for Daniel to not be at.", "Man. People who complain about teachers have NO IDEA what they though. \n\nThe idea that someone \u2018business\u2019 is of a higher order or more difficult is insane. \n\nAnytime I hear that opinion come from someone  I judge them idiots and never look at them the same.", "NTA and Jake is A KEEPER.", "Perfect and honest retort.

Did he think he learned all the medical info by himself to get to where he\u2019s at? Assuming he has a job that requires a degree\u2026 well, no. A teacher taught him.

Don\u2019t apologize, I have a major ass for a BIL except he has done and said so many things to me.  He took advantage way too many times and my hubby NEVER once defended me.  Now we don\u2019t speak and I don\u2019t allow him here. First off I\u2019m so glad your BF defended you and what your BIL said was really really rude.  I was a teacher too and I\u2019m horrified.  Teaching is very rewarding and exhausting.  It also takes a lot out of you.  He needs to be the FIRST one to apologize.", "No do not apologize. NTA", "Do not apologize under any circumstances. Even if he apologizes to you. He insulted your career in your own home. If you let him get away with that he'll be an abusive asshole to you for the rest of your life. If someone abuses you in your own home, which is what your future BIL did here, you have to have a zero tolerance policy on that. Honestly, he should be kicked out of the house regardless of whether he apologizes. You need to protect yourself from abusers. If you apologize for what you said, you're inviting more abuse into your life.\n\nObviously, NTA.  \n\n\nEdit: I'm also zero tolerance towards insulting teachers. If someone did not respect teaching as a career, I wouldn't let them step foot in my home, regardless of relation. So not only did he belittle you in your own home, he belittled one of the noblest professions there is. All while you're doing him a favor. I'm on your husbands side, almost.

So you might feel better if you sent him a soft apology, maybe just that you regret mentioning his family; your intention wasn't to hurt him but to point out that people find meaning in different ways. Much like forgiveness is for the forgiver, in this case the expression of regret is for you so it won't gnaw away at you. \n\nYou should stand firm in defending yourself and your profession.

Those are fighting words. As a humanities teacher in higher ed. I have gotten these kinds of comments from acquaintances in engineering/medicine. It's so demeaning. And for what? So that they can feel superior? Fucking philistines. Daniel is no different. Good for you for standing up for yourself. Teaching is NOT babysitting.

Yes, your comment was unkind, but Daniel was SO MUCH WORSE. I would probably let your fiance handle it for now. Yes, maybe uninviting him from the wedding is too much and things will calm down. If Daniel is actually sorry, I think that apologising in kind is a good idea. But you are definitely the wronged party here.

Do not apologize** for defending yourself against Daniel's abuse.  \n\nNTA.  **You did not do wrong.**  If you apologize, people like Daniel will see it as 'proof' that they were the 'real' victim, not you.

Not you.   \n\n**There's a manipulation tactic called DARVO,** deny, attack, reverse victim and offender.  **If you apologize,** which Daniel will probably try to manipulate you into doing, **Daniel will play victim and blame you, without taking any responsibility** or accountability **for his own wrongdoing.**  And then, he will do it again.\n\n*Jake even went as far as to say that if I did not receive an apology, Daniel would not be at our wedding, which I think might be a bit extreme.*\n\n**It's not extreme to defend you and protect you** from someone that is emotionally and verbally abusive.  That Daniel treated you this way, and would not apologize immediately when he was called out, and given several chances to see that his behavior was wrong, shows that ***Daniel doesn't see his behavior as wrong.***  You say that the relationship between Jake and Daniel isn't a good one; this is probably why, because Daniel won't see his own behavior as wrong, when it's wrong.\n\n**Jake isn't saying this based on only this one incident.**  This is a long, long series of such incidents.   **And this is not just about his mistreatment to you.  It's about Jake's relationship with him, for a lifetime.**  Jake is giving Daniel a golden chance here, to give a simple, deserved apology to you for the insults, accusations and mistreatment, in order to try to rebuild a relationship with Jake.  If Daniel won't do this, won't admit his wrongs are wrong, then the two of them cannot build a healthy relationship for the future.  **What Jake is saying isn't extreme at all.  It's what is needed to heal a relationship with a person that has a history of this sort of behavior.**", "Do Not apologize", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nHis comments about your career were rude and unnecessary, considering that he wasn't even part of the conversation.\n\nYou reaching into history to find a personal attack that would really be a knife in his back---that's way into asshole territory.

This subreddit can be very vindictive and eye-for-an-eye, I think taking the high road and being \"the better person\" here will say a lot.\n\nOften times in cycles where two people are constantly at odds in a relationship, it takes one of them to be the bigger person and make an attempt to break the cycle, even if they didn't \"start\" it. You have the power to be that person and not stoop to your bro-in-law's level. \n\nWe can sit here and talk all day about how he's the one in the wrong or he should come to you first, but at the end of the day, relationships don't work that way. They're messy things, they're not just transactions. I think you owe it to yourself more than anything to be the first to apologize.

I came home from school yesterday in not the best mood, and my fianc\u00e9, \u201cJake\u201d (25M) immediately noticed I wasn\u2019t acting like myself. He asked me what happened and although I didn\u2019t really go into too much detail, I told him it was a rough day at work. Then Jake\u2019s brother, \u201cDaniel\u201d (31M), who is currently staying with us,  chimed into the conversation from across the room. He said that I didn\u2019t have a right to complain because teachers are glorified babysitters, and that if I had a \u201creal job\u201d maybe he\u2019d understand. \n\nNormally, I try to brush these comments off, and honestly at first, I wasn\u2019t sure if he was kidding, so I gave him the opportunity to repeat what he said, but he was serious. The second time, he added that \u201che didn\u2019t understand why I didn\u2019t want to do something \u201cmeaningful and productive\u201d with my life. At this point, Jake was getting pretty upset listening to this happen. He and Daniel have a very tumultuous relationship that they were recently working on, but he told Daniel that if he continues to speak to me that way he would have to leave our house. \n\nIt is also important to add here that Daniel works really long hours in a hospital, has a 2 year old daughter, and has commented previously about how he wishes he got to spend more time with her. In the moment with my frustration. I responded to Daniel\u2019s  comments by saying, \u201cat least I get to spend every holiday and summer with my family, that\u2019s what meaningful and productive to me.\u201d\n\nDaniel and stormed out, and shortly after I felt really bad about what I\u2019d said. I asked Jake if I should text Daniel and apologize or wait for him to come back and do it in person. Jake said that I\u2019m NTA, and that Daniel needs to be the first one to apologize to me. Jake even went as far as to say that if I did not receive an apology, Daniel would not be at our wedding, which I think might be a bit extreme. I can see both sides here. Daniel did start the argument, and enter a conversation that wasn\u2019t about him to begin with quite aggressively, but I\u2019m now unsure if my comments were out of line. AITA? Should I apologize to Daniel?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
