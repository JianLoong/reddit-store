Last Monday or Tuesday she left the candle burning when she went upstairs to bed, I was also already upstairs not planning to come back down but happened to notice the light of the candle still burning. I went down blew it out, told my wife that if she wants to burn candles she needs to be sure they\u2019re out before leaving them unattended. Saturday she left one burning, went outside and started doing some chores outside, I heard her go outside and went downstairs about 45 minutes later to a burning candle. Told her the same thing, she wants them, she needs to be responsible for them. She was off work today, made plans to go to dinner with a friend, they met at 5:30 for dinner I got home around 6:30 to a candle burning in our living room. I blew it out then took it and the other 3 candles she had out to the dumpster. In hindsight I wish I wouldn\u2019t have but I also feel that if she is too irresponsible to make sure they\u2019re out she will eventually burn our house down.
