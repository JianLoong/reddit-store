If you can't find the chef who emphatically tells you they can do it and keep the meat delicious then do it for yourself! This is where you use cheap meat! You can make great steak at home, all you need is a good sturdy heavy duty pan preferably cast iron, something that can also go in the oven, get it rocket hot, take the steak out of the fridge while you are heating up the pan, give it a little bit of salt and pepper, let the meat come to room temperature. Preheat your oven to 350 at the same time.  When the pan is hot put in a little bit of either butter and high temperature oil or just the high temp oil, pat your steak dry and put it right into the pan. Don't move the meat let it sit there for two solid minutes, after 2 minutes it should have a really nice crust and easily flip over, use tongs not a fork, flip and heat for another 2 minutes, when it's got it's nice crust do the sides to give it that nice golden brown crust throw in a little bit more butter, okay a big slab of butter, some in the pan some on top of the meat, put the pan in the preheated oven and let it cook through. The time will depend upon how thick the steak is, invest in a good meat thermometer that you can put into the steak and leave it there in the oven, it should be about 15 bucks for a decent one. When the meat has come to full temperature pull the pan out, watch the handle it's going to be hot, put it back on a cutting board with a tent of foil, let it rest for 10-15 minutes, don't cut into it before that, that's how you'll lose the juices and make it dry, after 15 minutes enjoy your well done moist steak you'll love it!", "NTA I like my steak well done (come for me,\nI don\u2019t care) and would want you to spend a fortune on a posh steak for me.", "No!
