Let people know in advance, and explain that there will be 2 types of steak, wagyu and prime. The wagyu will be cooked from rare to medium, and the prime will be cooked to medium and well-done due to the type of steaks they are and the recommendations you have read online about which steaks taste best with which preparation (be able to share a link if this is true). And if that anyone wants the prime steak rare or the waygu well done to let you know in advance. My grandma doesn't like waygu steak at all and This gives some wiggle room and sounds less judgement.", "I think honesty is key here. You would not make a stew with a steak either so it is perfectly fine to choose a cut according to the cooking planned. \n\nSo NTA. \n\nHowever you need to tell people that you bought this special cut which is cooked to a certain point only to taste it's best while you got another cut that will be good to cook longer since the other cut is not ideal for longer cooking time.", "INFO: Can we be coworkers? I'll take my Wagyu steak medium rare, but more on the rare side, if you could. Please and thank you, OP!", "NTA, anyone saying otherwise is a absolute moron.", "I'm not a steak expert, but it's my understanding that the thing that makes wagyu special in the first place is lost when cooked well done. (I think I read it's the marbling, and something about those fats melting away?)\n\nAlso, there are plenty of cuts of steak that are delicious and not CHEAP just because they're *cheaper* than wagyu beef lol. You said you're being open about it/not lying to anyone. I think this is a smart, and fair decision. Anything \"wagyu\" about it would be unidentifiable when cooked medium-well/well done. It's good to not be wasteful IMO.", "Info: is the company paying for the meat or is it coming out of your pocket?", "INFO: Are you planning to lie to the people who get the lower grade meat?", "NTA cooking a wagyu medium well or above is borderline blasphemy, get a nice steak with good marbling for the well done folks so it doesn\u2019t dry out. I would tell them it\u2019s a different cut with the right marbling for medium well or well done.", "NTA - People who don't understand that well done steak is borderline leather and you will wind up chewing it forever, should be made to eat a lesser grade of steak. Don't waste your money or the food that some folks just don't get.", "NTA\n\nIt'd be absurd to buy Wagyu steaks and then cooking them to medium well and well done. They'd be ruined.\n\nBuy lower grade steaks for those who want their meat overcooked. They won't notice the difference.", "YWBTA. Your job is to buy the food, not decide if people are \"worthy\" of the good stuff because they may like their food cooked differently than you.", "If you can't cook a medium well or well done steak that is melt in your mouth delicious than that says more about you as the cook than it does about the quality of steak.\n\nYWBTA if you did this\n\nAnd you risk alienating members of your team if they find out you cheaped out on their meat because of you think all 8 billion people on this planet have the exact same taste buds as you\n\nThis is not worth the drama\n\nEither buy everyone Waygu or buy everyone lesser quality\n\nYou mix and match and I guarantee...it will blow up in your face", "NTA since you're not hiding it, perfectly reasonable.", "First, I dont even know how a well done Wagyu would taste?!?!  So I would be honest and say that a Wagyu cannot be cooked well done, and for those folks asking for it, you'd rather buy a cut that will taste good that way.\n\nIts all going to come down to the communications and explanation", "Ehh\u2026 probably YTA. If everything goes perfectly (everyone getting the lower grade doesn\u2019t care, you explain it in a way they don\u2019t take offence to, no one is in the mood to stir up drama/gossip), this may not be an issue. But that\u2019s a pretty big if and not worth it in the end. \n\nI take it you want to get the wagyu to make the party special? This whole two grade of meat thing has a strong probability of overshadowing anything special it may have brought to the party if people take it the wrong way.", "Imagine lowering the standard for others for believing you know better.\n\nYta btw, if you feel so strongly tell others they getting cheap meat if theyw ant it well done, and see how fsr your stunt will take you", "Yes, YWBTA.  I feel you, especially when it comes to high quality steaks, but you're creating a caste system, and that's not cool.  Keep it even, either wagyu for everyone or no one.", "Well yes YTA. \n\nI agree that well done is a shame for a good stake but medium well is, according to steak chefs, is still a very good steak. \n\nBut aside from that you are acting like a shop judging people on their tastes. \n\nBuy a cheaper cut that work well both rare and well done. \n\nIt\u2019s cheaper, everyone can get what they like, and you don\u2019t come of as a snobbery asshole.", "YWBTA\n\nMaybe you don't know how to cook medium well and well properly? Those meats taste tremendously different and it's not fair for somebody who prefers medium well or well to get a cheaper cut of beef. Wagyu beef taste a million times better even when it's well done or medium well, don't cheap out on those people because of their preferences, focus instead on cooking it properly.", "YWBTA. While it's just a work party, you could open yourself to some type of inequality claim/lawsuit, petty as it may be. Think of it as giving bonuses, you can't necessarily give someone a smaller bonus because you don't like the way they'd spend it.", "YTA... \n\nI prefer my steaks rare but if purchasing for everyone either they all get the same or asked individually what they want ('cause that works for everyone, even people who don't eat certain things).", "YTA. And pretentious to boot. Who put your smug little ass in charge of deciding if people are eating their steak correctly? Get the same quality of steak for everyone and stop being such a judgemental dick.\n\nI like my steak still bleeding, but I'd rather eat an over done piece of shoe leather than hang out with snobby know-it-alls like you.", "YWBTA - you are putting your expectations on others.  Yes, cooking a quality piece of meat to well done should be a crime, it unfortunately isn't (lol).  What you are doing is giving those people the chance to still try a quality piece of meat.  Isn't that the point of your gift?", "Imagine gatekeeping meat. YTa", "People here seem to forget you are buying the steaks, and telling people what is and what isnt wagyu. Fuckin A right i wouldnt want to cook wagyu i bought with my own money to anything past medium rare.

It's already nice enough that you are buying steaks for the office party in general. On top of that, you are putting  thought into what grade tastes better based on the cooking temperature. If anyone complains, then they need to suck it up or pay for their own meal from somewhere else.", "NTA. You\u2019re right it wouldn\u2019t be worth it if you\u2019re going to overcook them.", "NTA. Eww. Just get them a hamburger", "NTA, and not even close.  You are literally still buying them an expensive cut of steak, just not a cut of steak that is hundreds of dollars. And it\u2019s coming out of your own pocket! They  should be grateful for your generosity.", "Welp, guess I\u2019m never eating Wagyu. Too much red/blood makes me feel weird", "NTA. To all the Y T A responses, tell us you don\u2019t know steak without telling us you don\u2019t know steak.", "Every restaurant in the world would, why shouldn\u2019t you.", "NAH, because it\u2019s your money. but a wagyu cooked medium well or well done would still be more tender and flavorful than a cheaper cut, that\u2019s the whole point of the marbling. it might seem like a waste to you because that\u2019s not how you like your steak, but it would still be better than a prime or choice.", "I don't think you're an AH but there are a lot of factors that can play in whether you should do this or not. In my company you would start a war if you do this because we've got the most envious people so if someone gets a better steak than another there would be drama. It also belongs how many people would be in the 'cheap meat group'. If there's only one or two it would be not nice to single them out although I understand where you're coming from. Ultimately it should be a matter of budget, if there's a handful of people who would get the cheap meat you should think if starting a possible fight between workers is worth the money you're saving. Why don't you just ask everyone if they are okay with it or not? I personally wouldn't mind but some people are weird when it comes to uneven gifts and stuff.", "NTA as long as you tell people. I mean, you're paying for it regardless, but you know that people will complain if they figure it out on their own. I prefer my steak more medium well and I would not have an issue with this whatsoever", "YTA   Get the same for everyone whether they want it Mooing or cremated", "YTA.  Just get the prime cut, it's an office party.  This way the people who just like to walk the cow by the flame will be  happy and those that like it thoroughly dead and crisp will be happy.  Can use the money that you save from buying Wagyu on other fun things.  If you like Wagyu so much, then have a small party on your own to cook it.", "I like this idea here let the workers choose", "This is a great reply.  Most people won't be offended and the couple of argumentative types who would be inclined to say \"I want the high dollar steak I'm owed\" can request it.", "While we are not currently hiring, with that steak order we suddenly have an opening.", "I'll also be your co-worker OP.  Medium rare as well.", "In this instance it\u2019s basically the same thing.", "No, I would tell them. I was going to get a different cut entirely that handles being cooked to that level better than most.", "Wagyu Is renowned for its marbling", "Bullshit. The only way to waste more money than cooking a wagyu steak well done  is if you cooked it well done over a flaming pit of money.

They should be grateful for his generosity.", "I understand where you are coming from, but the issue isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t like the way they are asking it to be cooked, if that\u2019s what you like, more power to you. The issue is that the thing that makes the wagyu special will be gone.", "OP isn't hiding the different meat. There's nothing to find out", "There\u2019s no such thing as melt in your mouth well done steak lol", "There is no such thing as \u201cmelt in your mouth\u201d well done steak.", "This", "This is definitely not a caste system situation.\n\nOP would essentially be having 2 steak options with 2 different cooking levels. People can choose what they like best.\n\nIt would be wasteful to have Wagyu steaks being cooked to medium well or well done.", "How is it the same thing? Are you the ceo of the company?", "Well NTA at all then. As someone who likes their steaks to resemble shoe leather, I would *rather* you NOT get me the fancy/expensive stuff. It would feel like a waste lol & plenty of cuts would still be delicious to me at shoe leather quality lmao. (I know I'll probably get downvotes for how I eat my steak lmfao \ud83d\ude05 \ud83d\udc5e)", "It absolutely will not be gone, wagyu beef is delicious regardless of how you cook it unless you cook it incorrectly, well done does not mean dried out when cooked properly", "That's your opinion, not fact. If you want your coworkers to resent you and think of you as an AH, go ahead with it, but you would DEFINITELY be the AH in this situation.", "Agree - I\u2019m one of \u201cthose\u201d people who prefer well done and I wouldn\u2019t waste money on wagyu steak.  There is no point to it\u2026..", "Yes", "Not exactly, the better the quality of meat the better it tastes when cooked properly, there's nothing that says well done can't be cooked properly, it's a skill perhaps OP does not have this skill or knowledge. I would never accept a lower quality piece of beef just because I wanted it well done, well done is not charred", "Incorrect. That is not what is taught in any culinary school. To get something to the point of well done and not just a Chicago med rare you literally dry it out.   \nWhich is why every professional chef worth their salt considers anything beyond medium ruined.", "No, That\u2019s fact lol. A well done wagyu is an oxymoron and waste of money.", "No, that is a fact. The marbling in wagyu, which is what makes it special, is lost when you cook it well done. All that fat melts away. It's not just a matter of the opinion that well-done steaks are ruined in general, you literally buy wagyu for the marbled fats, and cooking it that much just gets rid of it. I think OP's solution is a perfectly reasonable one.", "Absolutely not this is a load.... anything beyond medium is ruined that is what is taught in every major culinary school.\n\nJust because you eat everyday doesn't mean you have a clue and can invalidate fact.\n\nIn fact the cuts he mentions hold up much better when being cooked to well done because they have less fat content.\n\nClearly you dont understand any of this because you clearly just assumed waygu is always better because $$$.\n\nOP has wayyyy more culinary experience than you very very clearly. Why are you even offering your opinion on something you have less knowledge than OP about?\n\nEdit: Not less knowledge litterally none in comparison to OP", "I truly don't get not just letting people enjoy things the way they enjoy them. If you know how to cook, medium well and well are not dry or tough.", "That's good to know! I don't like steak unless it's super extra well done, I like mine a little charred lol. I also don't like when it's juicy, it needs to be a little dry & completely grey/white in the middle for me \ud83d\ude06 So I'd hate to waste the expensive stuff on myself. But, I guess a good option would be to offer both & explain why they wanted to use the non-wagyu for the well done. Then people can choose?", "No way, I've been lucky enough to eat in multiple high-end steakhouses around the world and have been taught to prepare steak at home myself, I've had the most amazing well done steak which is not dry at all. In the spirit of all things good, this is one topic we will have to agreed to disagree on", "Yes! Thank you!\n\nThe equivalent would be a 21 year old single malt mixed with cola and ice. Fine if you want your whisky with cola and ice, but it will be Ballantines", "I agree, I think you hit the nail on the head though, it sounds like OP may be uncomfortable cooking medium well or well, wagyu has plenty of marbling and taste wonderful well done when cooked correctly.", "I'm like you I can't see any pink in my meat, just not my thing! I've been privileged to eat at a few really nice steakhouses, a good chef can make a really nice piece of meat well done and taste like butter! Always ask how the chef feels about well done, if they push back or even hesitate don't bother, but if they say no problem then they know what they're doing, the trick is literally to get a great seer on all sides, then pop it into an oven to warm it all the way through, it will keep the meat moist without runny juices, and we'll cook thoroughly all the pink to a brown and you will love it!", "you are lying. Or utterly clueless.", "Oooh thank you!! I've literally never ordered a steak from a restaurant, because I've seen others order well done & they either weren't, or they weren't cooked well. I love the idea to test it by asking how the chef feels about it...seems like a good gauge to whether or not it's worth it. I will have to try this lol.", "You are close-minded and have my pity. \n\nDo you really think I'd waste my time lying about steak? There is a big world out there, you will miss a lot of it by going around this Earth believing you know everything", "Do it and treat yourself! If you can't find the chef who emphatically tells you they can do it and keep the meat delicious then do it for yourself! This is where you use cheap meat! You can make great steak at home, all you need is a good sturdy heavy duty pan preferably cast iron, something that can also go in the oven, get it rocket hot, take the steak out of the fridge while you are heating up the pan, give it a little bit of salt and pepper, let the meat come to room temperature. Preheat your oven to 350 at the same time.  When the pan is hot put in a little bit of either butter and high temperature oil or just the high temp oil, pat your steak dry and put it right into the pan. Don't move the meat let it sit there for two solid minutes, after 2 minutes it should have a really nice crust and easily flip over, use tongs not a fork, flip and heat for another 2 minutes, when it's got it's nice crust do the sides to give it that nice golden brown crust throw in a little bit more butter, okay a big slab of butter, some in the pan some on top of the meat, put the pan in the preheated oven and let it cook through. The time will depend upon how thick the steak is, invest in a good meat thermometer that you can put into the steak and leave it there in the oven, it should be about 15 bucks for a decent one. When the meat has come to full temperature pull the pan out, watch the handle it's going to be hot, put it back on a cutting board with a tent of foil, let it rest for 10-15 minutes, don't cut into it before that, that's how you'll lose the juices and make it dry, after 15 minutes enjoy your well done moist steak you'll love it!"]}
