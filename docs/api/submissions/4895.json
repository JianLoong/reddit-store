If you can't find the chef who emphatically tells you they can do it and keep the meat delicious then do it for yourself! This is where you use cheap meat! You can make great steak at home, all you need is a good sturdy heavy duty pan preferably cast iron, something that can also go in the oven, get it rocket hot, take the steak out of the fridge while you are heating up the pan, give it a little bit of salt and pepper, let the meat come to room temperature. Preheat your oven to 350 at the same time.  When the pan is hot put in a little bit of either butter and high temperature oil or just the high temp oil, pat your steak dry and put it right into the pan. Don't move the meat let it sit there for two solid minutes, after 2 minutes it should have a really nice crust and easily flip over, use tongs not a fork, flip and heat for another 2 minutes, when it's got it's nice crust do the sides to give it that nice golden brown crust throw in a little bit more butter, okay a big slab of butter, some in the pan some on top of the meat, put the pan in the preheated oven and let it cook through. The time will depend upon how thick the steak is, invest in a good meat thermometer that you can put into the steak and leave it there in the oven, it should be about 15 bucks for a decent one. When the meat has come to full temperature pull the pan out, watch the handle it's going to be hot, put it back on a cutting board with a tent of foil, let it rest for 10-15 minutes, don't cut into it before that, that's how you'll lose the juices and make it dry, after 15 minutes enjoy your well done moist steak you'll love it!", "NTA I like my steak well done (come for me,\nI don\u2019t care) and would want you to spend a fortune on a posh steak for me.", "No!

Like, you don't cook a pork chop rare because that is the wrong way to prepare that kind of meat. That being said, wagyu is INSANELY fatty (which is why it's delicious) -- you know most people don't actually eat waygu the way they normally eat steaks, right? Generally waygu is like strips on top of a meal, eating 250 grams of beef fat is not going to make you feel great afterwards.", "NTA. I get that everyone\u2019s entitled to their tastes, but I\u2019ll share what I said to a patron when I used to work in a bar: this guy was being pressured by his friends to try scotch so he ordered a Talisker and Coke. I told him that honestly, it\u2019s not going to taste great mixing a smoky/peaty scotch with coke, and if gonna mix, there\u2019s no reason to spend that much. It would be an expensive lesson to learn \ud83e\udd23. I feel the same about steak. If you\u2019re going to cook it to hell, no need to spend that much.", "The main question is whether they are WORTHY\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ZYLYDi2I0lY", "YTA. Stop being a pretentious AH and serve the same quality steak to everyone. Work is paying for it, not you. Firstly, it is not worth the complaints if people rightfully feel it isn't fair. Secondly, and more importantly, trying to force your food preferences on others and punishing them for not having your palette just makes you a narcissistic AH. Who cares if Jan likes her steak like charcoal so it won't be \"special\". You don't have to eat it and they don't care about your foodie ideals. What they do know is they they are not being offered a \"quality\" steak. The bbq is to reward staff for doing well so give them the same steak done the way they like it. It is NOT. ABOUT. YOU. All your idea will do is cause strife at a party that is supposed to create good will.", "I agree but could see an AITA post with someone saying they got upset because some meat snob treated guests cruelly by giving them cheap cuts of meat just because they like their steak well done.

It's none of your business. We don't all like the same things, and that's okay. Maybe their tastes aren't as sophisticated as yours, but maybe they aren't judgemental jerks spouting their opinions on other people's preferences.", "Where does it say that? He may be buying them from the shop but I would expect work to be reimbursing him. I call BS that someone would buy wagyu steaks out of their own pocket for work unless they were reimbursed or they actually own the company.

Well tell him I said thank you, he saved those steaks! Kinda.

Some people may think it\u2019s unfair they can\u2019t get the better cut because they have different preference for how it\u2019s cooked. I understand why you wouldn\u2019t want to cook wagyu well done, but do you risk potential fallout of people complaining about not getting certain cut of meat? Also it\u2019s not like the meat will be wasted, people will eat it.", "I am surprised by the NTA consensus here. I have seen similar AITA posts before where somebody insists on getting a \"lower\" cut of meat for people who have different tastes and prefer medium well or well done.

He cooked a $1600 steak well done. He thought it would be ruined but he said it was still much better than a cheaper steak but not nearly as good as it would be medium rare.
