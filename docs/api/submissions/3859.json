Your wife said one thing (that wasn\u2019t even THAT bad) and your mom has held it over you all this time. \n\nYeah your mom can decide who she wants to invite on vacation but in this situation she\u2019s deliberately having family time without you. Over a grudge from ages ago. That makes her the AH. \n\nI have been in a similar situation to your wife- my MIL started excluding us from stuff whilst also still including the rest of the family. It sucks. We started doing more stuff with my family which made her jealous and therefore worsened the situation. \n\nShe\u2019s trying to make your wife realise that actions have consequences but in reality, holding this grudge will push you away and cause her to miss out on things like having a relationship with your kids. \n\nAll you can do is treat your mom with kindness and hope she lets the grudge go.

Seriously?\n\nHowever, I do think your mother is unbelievably petty and to be honest, a bit of a shitty parent. If my mother was upset with my behaviour or someone close to me\u2019s behaviour, she would *talk* to me about it, not jeopardise my relationships and try to isolate me from my siblings to make a point about feeling left out.

She was single - if you left her to go on your dumb dates, what would she be doing?  She'd be alone - on a trip that she paid for YOU to go on.  She probably paid for you guys so that she wouldn't have to be alone on the trip.  \n\nYour expectations were wrong, and I'm not surprised your mom was hurt.

She shouldn't even have had children if she is this petty and immature \n\nWTF?

Your mom doesn't have to pay for trips for rude and ungrateful people.\n\n>My mom said I'm an adult and not entitled to a free trip, I continued to yell at her and said she can't keep favoring my sisters if she wants a relationship,\n\nWell, that's certainly up to you.  If you want to cut your mother off because she won't pay for a free vacation for two grown adults, go right ahead.\n\nIs it the fact that your family is going on vacations without you, or the fact that you're not getting a free vacation that's bothering you?  Because if it's just the fact that they're vacationing without you, you could fix that.  Offer to pay your own way.  Let your mother see that you and your wife are not the rude and ungrateful couple you used to be.\n\nOf course, if it's just the free vacation that's upsetting you... well then, go ahead and cut your mom off.

Sometimes you need alone time even on a vacation. If she was shit talking, then yeah, she should apologize. But the moms reaction is overblown. She wouldn\u2019t even spend time with her son when they were both out of town for a wedding, so even when they were traveling separately, she still didn\u2019t want to spend time with them.

This was a massive transgression in her world. Your wife humiliated her by shit talking her to her own family. And frankly your date night attitude is a little bratty. I get it, it would have been nice, but when you aren\u2019t paying for the trip you\u2019re at the mercy of the person who did pay\u2026\n\nMoving forward to this argument: If you miss your connection to your family and feel like an outsider? THAT is the conversation you should be having. You made it about a trip (which you are not entitled to) and frankly given your family tension it makes no sense to want to go on that trip. The motivations for wanting to go on that trip seem shallow, entitled, and wildly inappropriate. \n\nYou made things a lot worse by devolving into a childish temper tantrum about not getting a free trip as an adult. \n\nHave the real conversation. \nYou don\u2019t feel welcome by your parent or siblings and it hurts.\n\nIt\u2019s good that you see that your mom is human and might benefit from therapy. That can help with empathy. But I would strongly recommend you get into some therapy as well and explore these dynamics on your own first. Mother-son bonds are complicated if a mother figure is constantly unhappy without male validation in her life. A lot of times if you\u2019re raised by someone who lacks self-awareness, needs constant validation, behaves immaturely, and belittles others (e.g. calling your wife a bitch) you run the risk of potentially picking up on some of those behaviors yourself in your own life. I speak from experience.\n\nGet some therapy. Talk about this dynamic, talk about this incident. You seem to have a lot of resentment towards your mother and I doubt it started with these trips\u2026 I sympathize with wanting your family dynamic to be different - but you should examine why that\u2019s not the conversation you chose to have. You should also examine why you thought screaming and telling your mom she doesn\u2019t deserve money was the only way to get the point across.\n\nDeal with your own issues first. Then try talking to your mom about the real problem without and audience and without there being some sort of gain to you other than getting to be with your family.", "NTA , your mom sounds overbearing and manipulative", "Honestly from this sentence alone I was already voting YTA. The mom paid for a trip for her and her son and son's gf. I would assume that means they're all gonna hang out together. Like I'm not paying for us to travel somewhere with company only to be ditched. OP complains that they had no days they could spend alone. Like dude your single mom literally paid for a family trip and you wanna make it a couple's trip on her dime. It came off as very selfish and unsympathetic towards his lonely mom. He mentions that his mom doesn't discuss feelings as if it were a bad thing. Like no bro, she just prefers to keep the peace. She didn't bring up your wife's comments so that it wouldn't fracture the relationship completely. Of course she is not going to be as close anymore, y'all hurt her feelings. Like why would anyone want to hang out with someone who went around complaining about my presence on a trip I paid for.  This info got back to your mom bc instaed of just keeping it private, your wife complained to your family. That's a low blow to have to hear from my family what my son's gf said. It would sting to hear it from others bc now everyone else knows her feelings too. YTA for being upset that she isn't inviting you on trips anymore. Your sisters clearly don't mind hanging out with their mom or don't complain. So ofc she'll invite them, they click. I would not invite and pay for ppl  who feel my presence is overbearing. Y'all are entitled. Y'all are adults in age, but childish in logic and reasoning. You don't get to go on a free trip to Greece when you can't even stand her. You don't get to make demands on how others spend their money. She tried with you two and y'all blew it. It's like when you play w a toy but then you toss it aside bc it bores you. But now that someone else is having fun w it you want it back. It's too late. She didn't ruin the relationship w you. You and your wife did by not being decent ppl. You want to go to Greece but ur wife doesn't ever want to travel for long w her. A trip to Greece is going to be long so why go? You think you can go bc clearly w your sisters there ur mom will have others to keep company so you and ur wife can ditch them. Doesn't work that way. She isn't obligated to pay for you. Y'all ruined a good thing and I hope your mom doesn't budge 'cause you're not even sorry that she had her feelings hurt.\n\n**YTA**", "He played his mom against his girlfriend and now he\u2019s surprised about the consequences for his own actions.", "Give me an adult free trips that i cant afford. Waaaaaah.", "I\u2019m hijacking this shockingly sane comment. The comment section is wild. It seems like people have a clear bias, like since she has the mom role, she\u2019s assumed to be good. But it\u2019s okay to dislike your mom. It\u2019s even okay to talk about your issues with her to other people \ud83d\ude2e\n\nOP, your mom clearly has some issues, she sounds like she may have borderline personality disorder. She is incapable of being alone, she defines herself by her relationship, and says manipulative things to get her way. She can\u2019t take criticism and even the smallest criticism is an attack on her whole character and she will hold onto it forever. I could be wrong, but from the post and op\u2019s comments her personality seems rather clear. It sounds really shitty to have a parent like this.\n\nI also can tell that you don\u2019t care as much about the money part of the whole situation, it\u2019s the exclusion. Sometimes parents exclude their kids using money, but here they just straight up said you aren\u2019t invited. I imagine you feel like they are a happy little family, together, and without you. From the way you write about it, it sounds like you have a wealth of stories, including stories from when you were a kid, and a lot of them still sting. Im sure there\u2019s years of context that is impossible to convey in this post. I\u2019m sorry your mom is treating you so badly and your sisters aren\u2019t sticking up for you. I know how that feels.\n\nA lot of people are saying you\u2019re childish and entitled, and yeah, maybe you were acting that way a bit. But that\u2019s what humans do, especially when arguing with a family member about something that brings up issues that are deeply rooted in the past. \n\n I also recommend going to a different sub,  they might offer you understanding and actual help dealing with this situation. Try these: \nr/bpdlovedones \nr/raisedbyborderlines\nr/adultchildren\nr/raisedbynarcissists\n\n\nTLDR : OP\u2019s relationship with his mother is fractured and the family dynamic is damaging.
