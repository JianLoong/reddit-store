Over a grudge from ages ago. That makes her the AH. \n\nI have been in a similar situation to your wife- my MIL started excluding us from stuff whilst also still including the rest of the family. It sucks. We started doing more stuff with my family which made her jealous and therefore worsened the situation. \n\nShe\u2019s trying to make your wife realise that actions have consequences but in reality, holding this grudge will push you away and cause her to miss out on things like having a relationship with your kids. \n\nAll you can do is treat your mom with kindness and hope she lets the grudge go.

It was a really nice trip, but she seemed to expect us to do everything together the whole time and we wanted some couple time.\n\nWhen someone PAYS FOR YOUR TRIP, you don't abandon them (especially when it's your freaking mother, for crying out loud) to go off and do your own thing.  She was single - if you left her to go on your dumb dates, what would she be doing?  She'd be alone - on a trip that she paid for YOU to go on.  She probably paid for you guys so that she wouldn't have to be alone on the trip.  \n\nYour expectations were wrong, and I'm not surprised your mom was hurt.  I'd be too, and I'd be mad at how ungrateful you and your girlfriend were.\n\nSo yeah - I wouldn't invite you again either.

She shouldn't even have had children if she is this petty and immature \n\nWTF?  Just because you have children doesn't mean you are financially responsible for taking them on vacations WHEN THE \"CHILDREN\" ARE ACTUALLY ADULTS.  You and your wife were rude and ungrateful.  Your mom doesn't have to pay for trips for rude and ungrateful people.\n\n>My mom said I'm an adult and not entitled to a free trip, I continued to yell at her and said she can't keep favoring my sisters if she wants a relationship,\n\nWell, that's certainly up to you.  If you want to cut your mother off because she won't pay for a free vacation for two grown adults, go right ahead.\n\nIs it the fact that your family is going on vacations without you, or the fact that you're not getting a free vacation that's bothering you?  Because if it's just the fact that they're vacationing without you, you could fix that.  Offer to pay your own way.  Let your mother see that you and your wife are not the rude and ungrateful couple you used to be.\n\nOf course, if it's just the free vacation that's upsetting you... well then, go ahead and cut your mom off.
