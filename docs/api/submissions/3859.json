She was single - if you left her to go on your dumb dates, what would she be doing?  She'd be alone - on a trip that she paid for YOU to go on.

I get that came from a place of hurt, but it's not constructive. \n\nAnyway, if what you want is to fix the relationship, approach your mom about that and that alone. Tell her you are sorry you yelled at her, that was wrong, and while it's not an excuse the reason is you've been feeling deeply hurt for a long while now beacuse you aren't sure she loves you anymore. That she is your mom and you will always love her, and you have felt rejected for several years now and it's really painful. \n\nTell her you want to work to rebuild your relationship, one on one, without your wife for now. Would she be willing to see a family therapist with you? If not, could you guys just get together sometimes for dinner or an outing or to cook or do things you enjoyed when you were a child?", "Which is 100% your nasty entitled wife\u2019s fault! She was horrible to your mom and you expect your mom to just forgive her? Lol you fucked up by letting your wife\u2019s comment get back to your mom. You\u2019ll never get a free trip again and the person to thank for that is your wife.", "Further INFO- \n\n- How long after your mom found out about you and your wife gossiping about her did you both attempt to apologize to her? \n\n- Why hasn\u2019t your wife apologized since? It\u2019s been years. \n\nFrankly, I\u2019m not surprised your mom doesn\u2019t want to hang out with either of you or pay for your vacations. You both made your bed, now you gotta lie in it at home.", "Your wife sounds manipulative AF.", "I mean, maybe you have the good fortune not to have parents who guilt-trip, but for my part I took his description at face value. Like I'm assuming when he says she was passive aggressive, she made her unhappiness at this plan perfectly clear, and was possibly even the one playing up the danger she'd be in if she had to go out on her own. I'm not at all assuming she seemed genuinely happy to go out on her own and her son is the one who unreasonably blocked her.", ">Because they didn\u2019t pay for it. They can get alone time when they pay for their own trip and bring mom along.\n\nOf course they're not entitled to the trip. But expecting to control every waking hour of people's lives when you pay for them to join on a trip as a gift is not at all a recipe for cultivating genuinely mutually-respectful, well-functioning relationships. You're basically making it totally transactional, at that point...", ">Because it was just the 3 of them. So if OP and their wife went to do their own thing, it\u2019s leaving mum on her own.\n\nSo what? 2 nights alone over the course of 1-2 weeks should not be a big deal for any fully functioning adult. Lots of us travel on our own all the time.", "Well we don\u2019t know exactly what or how she said it, but she was clearly complaining and saying she wouldn\u2019t travel that long with MIL again.  So she got her wish", "Maybe if she gets another free trip, she will learn not to criticize", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to be annoyed that you got to go on a vacation only to have your partners mother be overbearing the whole time. It\u2019s not much of a vacation if you can\u2019t enjoy it. Wife shouldn\u2019t have said something to the mothers side of the family but the MILs reaction is overboard. As OP said it seems like she has a lot of issues and would rather be emotionally abusive than get help. Calling your DIL a b**** is unnecessary, I\u2019d go low contact just for that. ESH", "This is the way OP tells the story. I have a feeling the truth was actually more then that and worse", "I am actually into the Mom here! If people don't want to hangout with you just Don't hang out with them... Be with people that actually enjoy your company \ud83d\ude09", "OP reeks of Entitlement soo i don't think someone told him before", "The problem here is OP and Wife can\u2019t afford the trip. You travel with someone on their dime and then ditch them? That\u2019s tacky. But then again OP and wife can have all the alone time they want now..since their no longer included on trips.", "But they said  the mom took them on vacation  spent her money  to spend family time with them if they ain't wanna be bothered  with her they don't have to have her spend her money  to take them on a trip should  of paid for themselves  and got vacation  time without  her", "I'm curious as to what OP/wife consider appropriate amounts of \"couple time.\" Because I don't think it's shitty or entitled to want some downtime or space on a vacation regardless of who pays for what because some people just need \"down time.\" If we're talking an evening or two spread out over a whole trip, that's not unreasonable. But if OP and wife wanted whole days to themselves that's something entirely different. \n\nThere's a tendency in this sub to see the person paying for a trip as being able to dictate the entire thing down to the smallest detail. While that's technically true, it can still be an asshole move. At a certain point you're not inviting guests, you're bringing staff to facilitate what you want to do and then demanding they be grateful for the opportunity. \n\nThe wife shouldn't have shit talked when it could get back to her MIL, but it's possible she was asking other members of the family if that was a normal experience. But by the time it made it back to MIL, it was twisted. Or wife was just shit talking, which is an AH move. \n\nTo me, this is ESH because no one is communicating like an adult.", "Sooooo YOU\u2019RE the wife? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 girl bye. Don\u2019t burn bridges and then want a FREE ride to the other side.", "It\u2019s not right or wrong.  They clearly had different expectations about the vacation.  Not everyone is vacation compatible.  I wouldn\u2019t vacation with certain members of my family but do with friends, But when the person paying sets the expectation that they don\u2019t want to be alone, suck it up.  That was the condition of accepting the free vacation.  It\u2019s not wrong to feel like it was a lot and not want to do it again.  But ops wife went and bitched about it to other family members.  Had she kept her mouth shut, they would Still be invited to trips.  They could politely decline any trip they don\u2019t want to go on.  Ops wife was extremely disrespectful in bitching to other family members.  I\u2019ve been married 21 years.  My husband and I have plenty to say about each other\u2019s families.  But only to each other.", "His Mom is Not an Ass, she paid for trip with them..what did the wife expect?? Thats its a Couple's Honeymoon?? Ofcourse the mom would want to Spend her time with her son and enjoy the Trip she paid for with her Son..... If the wife had a problem with that than she should have face the Mom and told her Rather than Going around and gossiping", "This is op\u2019s latest comment;\n\nI don't at all. I wanted one or two date nights in a romantic city. That in no way means I hate my mother. I miss her. My wife does kind of hate her to be honest, but wants to go to Greece badly enough\n\nThis right here is enough to prove moms not an ass and op and his wife are mad because she isn\u2019t letting them use her as a atm.", "This! Exactly what I was going to say.", "There's a difference between not wanting to be \"bothered\" with MIL at all and not wanting to spend every single solitary second of a multi day trip with her. Having one dinner as a couple or a day trip without her wouldn't be rude, imo.", "They didn't have to spend every waking minute with her, that sounds really exhausting.", "I was waiting for this. Mom paid for the vacation for them 3 did they think she wasn't going to want to hang out?? If they wanted a vacation where they can get alone time then they should pay for it themselves?? \n\nThey cannot have their cake and eat it too.", "I don\u2019t disagree, that\u2019s why I said ESH. OP and his wife aren\u2019t entitled to a vacation but calling you DIL names is really immature and she sounds awful to be around. So everyone sucks.", ">That was the condition of accepting the free vacation.\n\nDo we know that the mom made this expectation clear before they agreed to go on the vacation, or even before the vacation began? Because I don't see that mentioned anywhere and might assume the opposite. \n\n> But ops wife went and bitched about it to other family members.\n\nThat was dumb of course. \n\nI voted ESH, personally.", "Wow that is some messed up thinking. And then to write it out like its a defense??? Youre right now I have no idea the mom could be totally normal. Op and wife are definitely assholes.", "Op and his wife need therapy that is for sure.", "Go read all his comment. I really hope this is false. I find it hard to believe that someone is this entitled and selfish."]}
