She's had basically no social interaction beyond her parents, and like two times a year with the extended family. \n\nWhen niece finally started school, she had a meltdown and couldn't get along with any of the kids.

Or did they just say that off hand? An autism assessment is pretty comprehensive. My daughter\u2019s assessment was done over a couple of visits by a multidisciplinary team.", "I don\u2019t know about the autism part since you didn\u2019t tell us if she got evaluated for it or not. With everything else it sounds like how they treat her is bordering on abuse and I think someone should say something.", "It takes more than one visit to make an autism diagnosis, they sound like the kind of parents that only hear what they want to hear, and I seriously doubt a doctor who hasn\u2019t done a complete assessment would recommend isolating her even further. A lot of people are attacking  you with \u201c your not a doctor\u201d, that may be so, but you have been watching this unfold for 5 years and your concerned for your niece\u2019s future, so kudos to you. \n\nMy daughter\u2019s boyfriend is autistic and adhd, other than having some difficulty regulating big emotions, he is an amazing guy who makes her very happy, has a great job, good friends, etc, but he got a lot of early intervention. Honestly, I put more effort into socializing my dog than they did with their child.", "NTA but this depends if they have a diagnosis which i doubt after a week as can take 2 years in Uk to diagnose - I have an IVF baby during covid and the best thing we did was go to social classes. She starts school next year and currently goes to pre school and gymnastics both have boosted her confidence as she was very shy. This doesn't mean she isn't autistic however 1 week of school isn't probably enough for a diagnosis. My cousin and my friend have autistic kids and both are going to school as they are trained to help autistic kids. If they are so convinced she is I strongly don't think they should homeschool and instead look into a special education school. That might be a way to help your neice into a more social situation. Also go visit them more. Good luck helping your neice.", "So, you have limited experience with your niece. \n\nIs it possible that she has had very limited social experiences, *precisely because* your SIL and brother were trying to avoid experiences that they realized were overwhelming for their daughter? This would align with your statement that one parent always stayed at home with the child while the other was attending an event.\n\nThis would also align with your niece having no inherent interest in playing outside with other children, struggling to talk to strangers, and not understanding how to play.  \n\nIf she has been diagnosed by a medical professional who specializes in autism, then who are you to say otherwise? Your brother didn't want a secondary diagnosis from you. He wanted emotional support. You told him that his home life is jail. What did you think you would achieve by saying that? Did it not occur to you that that statement could be extremely hurtful to your brother?  \n\nAutism can run in families.

If so, why do you think that you, someone without medical education, knows better? The way your brother and SIL raised your niece sounds problematic. Yet, this doesn\u2019t make an ASS diagnosis any less credible. An ASS diagnosis is based on a very complex test. It most certainly isn\u2019t the same as an assessment of someone\u2019s social skills. ASS cannot be equated with underdeveloped social skills. These are two widely different things. Having underdeveloped social skills is only one of MANY ASS symptoms. A medically trained professional would never conclude someone has ASS based on underdeveloped social skills alone.", "ESH\n\nObviously, isolating and coddling a child is extremely damaging to their well-being and progression, and your brother and SIL are screwing up their niece's possible future.\n\nBut if a doctor has diagnosed her as autistic, you have no authority or right to disagree with that diagnosis. You admit you barely know your niece so you have absolutely no knowledge, professional or social, to base your attitude on.", "Does she actually have a diagnosis?  Or did a doctor say that it was a possibility?\n\nI don't know how it works there, but here they'd want to talk to the teacher and assess over a period of time.", "No, ofc not.

Because your disagreement with the diagnosis won\u2019t really hold much water if not. Keeping a child locked away and homeschooled forever without meeting any other children sounds awful but you\u2019re just going to alienate them further by telling them a medical diagnosis is wrong.

OP doesn\u2019t need to say they\u2019re being good parents if the daughter is autistic, because then the kid should have even more social support and interventions, not less. (I\u2019m autistic, if that matters to my opinion, but that\u2019s a pretty basic idea anyway.)

Or did the doctor just hear \"She had melt downs around other kids. She goes none verbal with teachers, \" and then he/she said \"oh definitely autistic!\" And nothing else was done to test it?\n\nBecause the doctor can not give a diagnosis on two sentences either. \nIt would be like if I was going to the doctor and saying, \"My stomach hurts every night,\" and he threw a diagnosis like \"oh cancer!\" without even testing why my stomach hurts. There could be multiple reasons. \n\nA lot get wrongly mentally diagnosed. Based on symptoms, that can be the first 5 different things. Like \"I'm depressed and can't focus,\" can you diagnose someone based on that?\nEven the places meant to test you get it wrong sometimes. \nI had a friend.

Congratulations you got to beat your chest and insult someone who was only asking a question.", "Yes and also autism tends to be hereditary so the behaviour OP has trouble with could very well be attributed to parental neurodivergence and coping.
