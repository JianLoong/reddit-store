You did everything you could to accommodate both your sister and your MIL. \n\nYou were caught between a rock and hard place: the dog is medical equipment for your sister so the dog needs to be present. But your MIL experiences breathing difficulties and other issues due to a dog allergy. Your MIL needed to be front and present to see her child get married; as far as seating is concerned she would take precedence. \n\nYour MIL also stayed for only one hour at her child\u2019s wedding reception. One. Hour. That\u2019s it. Sounds as if she was more than accommodating. \n\nYour sister should appreciate what you did.", "NTA.\n\n\"So, good sister, what should I have done? Force my husband's mother to go through severe allergic reactions during her son's wedding, all so that you could sit a little closer? Is that what you wanted me to do?\"", "NTA, your accommodations were more than reasonable.", "NTA \n\nCongratulations on your marriage! \n\nYou did your best. And it sounds like you had a good plan in place and everyone was included. I know it sucks at the moment because your sister feels bad, but like I said you did your best and I feel with time she will be OK with that.", "NTA. You did what you could to accommodate two important guests with health issues. Unfortunately, MIL takes precedence, the wedding was for both you and your husband, not just you. You even told her she would be welcome closer at the party after an hour, it was on her for leaving.", "NTA\n\n>I called her up to talk and she said I made her feel left out and bad by having to take her service dog, preferring to make her totally uncomfortable for my MIL's sake\n\nYour sister is being incredibly selfish. Yes, she needs her service dog for her health, but the dog would've made your MIL seriously unwell. This was a very tricky situation for you to manage and if you hadn't made these (entirely reasonable) arrangements, one of them either would've been in medical danger or excluded entirely from your wedding. So, what exactly did she want you to do? Rescind your MIL's invitation? Tell MIL to suck it up and suffer through severe allergic reactions to the dog?\n\nSister is going to have to understand that she isn't the only person in the world with a condition that requires accommodations, and there may well be other occasions in the future where she isn't able to be front-and-centre at events because of someone's serious allergy to dog fur.\n\n\\[EDIT\\] Apparently I suck at reading today and totally skipped over the fact OP had to be told by someone that her own sister wasn't at her wedding reception.\n\nThis is very strange, OP. I personally would notice my sibling's absence at an important event like this and I'm now starting to wonder if her comments are coming from deeper feelings of being pushed aside by you. Can you elaborate on that?\n\n\\[EDIT 2\\] Replies to my first edit have pointed out that apparently it's normal to not notice missing siblings and that the reception could've been so big she didn't notice, so I suppose I'm speaking purely from my own experience. No offence meant, OP.", "NTA - your sister and your MIL have just the same rights to be there and celebrate with you and your husband. \nIt seems to me you really planned this out and did your best to accommodate so just remember that. I understand your sisters health complications - but in the nicest way possible it\u2019s not your problem and you did your best to ensure everybody you love and wanted there, was there. \n\nCongratulations anyway! You did what was right for you on YOUR special day", "NTA. I can understand sis saying she felt YOU were leaving her out. Please reiterate that your husband was THE OTHER most important person in your wedding, and he deserved his mother there. When push comes to shove, parents take precedence over siblings. You made the right choice - as much as you love and would maybe even die for your sister, you were not marrying her.", "NTA. Short of your sister attending via Skype and having her portions delivered beforehand, this is about the only reasonable solution I can think of to accommodate both parties.", "NTA \n\nYou tried to make reasonable adjustments for both people, unfortunately you\u2019ll never be able to please everyone", "NTA. This is pretty open and shut, you made a compromise, thought everyone agreed to it, then learned after the fact that your sister wasn't okay with it. If she had issues with the arrangement, it was her responsibility to say something, and she didn't.", "NTA. One of the challenges with accessibility things is sometimes different people's needs are at odds. In your case, it's the dog your sister needs for her health and your MIL's severe allergies.\n\nYour sister is allowed to feel how she feels, but what makes an AH and this not N-A-H is she needed to share this. There weren't any easy decisions to make, and I think you made the best one given the circumstances", "NTA- your sister is being unreasonable, but I'd chalk up her reaction to the adjustments she's having to make to her new reality (needing a service dog). She needs to get used to the fact that this means she is now going to be excluded from some things to a lesser or greater degree because of this disability. Same would be getting used to being in a wheel chair, it may not be exactly fair, but compromises were made on both sides.", "You were in a complete no-win situation. Your compromise and solution was as fair as you possibly could be. I\u2019m sorry OP.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Why?  All things being equal (assuming your MIL is not a nightmare) mother of the groom should always trump siblings. This is her son. She has roles to play that are meaningful to both her and her son. Your sister was a guest.  Prioritizing a guest over the groom\u2019s mother, even during the reception would have been a recipe for future conflict with your MIL. That you made compromises to try and accommodate for both is something your MIL will remember in a positive way.  \n\nI get your sister felt left out.  While she does have a right to her feelings, it\u2019s not reasonable to expect you to damage your relationship with your in-laws just to make sure your sister got all the warm fuzzies she wanted. \n\nAt the end of the day, a wedding is essentially a tiered event. At the top is the bride and groom, then the parents.  These are the main characters. Everyone else is there to celebrate the union and are there as supporting characters.  \n\nAgain, all things being equal and assuming little to no drama between people, the reality of life is that when you marry, that becomes your immediate family.  You and your husband are the center.  Everyone else exists in ever expanding circles around that\u2026parents, siblings, aunts and uncles, etc.  \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to apologize for doing what you thought was a reasonable way to accommodate the GROOM\u2019S MOTHER while also including your extended family.", "NTA, having a potential alergic reaction definitely trumps feeling uncomfortable.", "NTA. You did the best you could to accommodate both of them. If she\u2019s mad that she wasn\u2019t prioritized over your husband\u2019s months that\u2019s her issue.", "How did you not realize that your sister didn\u2019t attend the reception until after the honeymoon? A\n\nYour sister has a heart condition that is sever enough that she needs a service dog. \n\nAlso wondering why your sister wasn\u2019t in the wedding. But, ultimately this was difficult to navigate", "NTA. I think you did the best you could in this situation. I really don\u2019t know what she expected you to do.", "NTA - you took reasonable steps to accommodate your sister\u2019s disability and your MIL\u2019s allergies. both are equally deserving of special accommodations.", "[deleted]", "NTA but I can see how she is feeling pushed aside because of her medical condition. So my question is will she be excluded from any family gatherings that mil is included?", "Definitely not the Ahole! You did everything you could to accommodate them both", "Nta but if she had a problem she should have made it known before the wedding", "NTA. I feel for your sister, unfortunately your MIL's allergies are serious enough to be a real concern. Your sister needs her service dog, this is her new reality, and, unfortunately, part of that reality is that she will have to deal with people who have severe allergies to dogs, and she will have to make accommodations for these people, just like people who aren't allergic to dogs will have to make accommodations for her.", "NTA you made a reasonable plan that met everyone's needs.  Your sister is an adult who made a choice to \"leave herself out\" from the event and is now trying to paint herself as the victim.  Ask her directly what SPECIFICALLY she was expecting for you and your husband to do?  Does she honestly think having EMS show up at your wedding while your MIL was in anaphylactic shock?", "I'm gonna be honest: this is a pretty complicated situation. You appeared to try to split the difference in this, but I completely understand the sister's situation and feelings since there is a service dog involved and she does have heart problems, as you described. From her perspective, it could be seen as treating her differently in a negative way because of her complications. She's entitled to those feelings as she probably felt ostracized, as evidenced by pushing here further back from the first row during the wedding and even at the party.\n\nBut also the mother-in-law being allergic is a big deal since you don't want to deal with that medical side of things, either. It's tough. It really is. I don't think anyone's the asshole here.\n\nYour sister is allowed to feel the way she does. The only thing I do wonder about is why wait until after the honeymoon to call and talk to her about it? I'm not saying this is the case but in your sister's mind that could once again confirm a preconceived notion to her that her situation is not being accounted for adequately.\n\nEither way, I hope you all are able to move on from this and have a healthy relationship.", "Looks like I\u2019m going against the grain a little, but YTA. You didn\u2019t compromise or split the difference at all. Both people had health issues that meant they needed to be apart, so you chose to separate your sister in all instances, that\u2019s not compromise. You left your sister out which is why she felt left out.", "YTA - one should have sat far away at the ceremony and one at the reception.

It\u2019s one of those situations where someone is going to feel left out, and obviously the sister (rightfully so) feels that way. It\u2019s made worse because of the medical situation.\n\nI tremendously sympathize with the OP on this because whatever they decided would have resulted in someone feeling left out on a very special and important day. The main thing I mostly have questions about is why wait until after the honeymoon to get in contact with the sister about what ended up transpiring. But I also get it. A lot is going on at that time.\n\nI\u2019m mostly fascinated by this situation because of the dynamics involved \uff0d i.e. health issues on both sides, mother-in-law leaving early regardless, call after honeymoon, etc. It\u2019s truly a \u201cdamned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t\u201d endeavor.", "I mean whatever, but don\u2019t say I compromised and did everything I could.

Whatever gets decided leaves someone excluded, even if it's not perceived to be that way. The mother-in-law obviously has to be up at the front, but so should the sister.\n\nIt just feels pretty tough to punish (for lack of a better term) the sister twice \u2014 once at the wedding and then again at the reception \u2014 for her medical situation. Even with the mother-in-law leaving after an hour. It makes the sister feel less-than, and calling *after* the honeymoon probably just reinforces that thought in the sister's mind.\n\nI don't know what the OP should have done, but the sister absolutely isn't in the wrong here, which should be made clear. And for anyone wondering why the sister didn't bring up how she felt before the wedding, the OP states she did. The sister likely accepted it just to appease and not make waves until after everything had passed, allowing the OP to have their day without worry.\n\nI originally commented about this, but it really is a very complicated situation.", "Have one sit away at the ceremony and one sit away at the reception.", "[deleted]", "It\u2019s a compromise from the alternative which is saying that the service dog can\u2019t come due to the allergy which would have been an awful outcome", "Seriously.

So I have multiple disabilities and sometimes there are just competing needs and not everyone can participate fully in the same things together. I think you did a very graceful job of including them both. It may be that your sister is still adjusting to how having a service dog may limit her, and with the stark reality that she has a serious disability.

For everyone saying NTA, I\u2019ve noticed not a single one of you has a service dog.

Btw, did I mention I was a bridesmaid? She claimed the same issue, but that person had their back to my table. \nI have to tell you, that was soul-crushing and felt like my presence was a burden. \n\nSo you saw that you tried to compromise, but you didn\u2019t.  Your sister went through A LOT to get a trained SD. \nMy service dog is fully groomed before a big event, so the only way to have allergy issues is to pet her. Honestly that\u2019s normally the case. Don\u2019t pet her, and the dog is working it\u2019s no different from medical equipment. \n\nSo if you wouldn\u2019t put a person in a wheelchair or walker off to the side, away from others, than doing it to someone with a SD is rude and ableist.", "NAH.

You did the best you could, I assume that MIL couldn't antihistamine herself up to her eyeballs to attend (I mean potentially if it was a less severe allergy but idk exactly how bad hers are) and it's the best way you could think of to include everyone but I completely see why your sister would feel left out. I would feel kinda lonely and pushed aside in that situation even if I understood the reasons why. It's a sign that you're part of your partners family now and you have made a clear statement that your sister is lower down in the pecking order than your partners mother. Which is not necessarily right or wrong but by making your sister the one who had to move and make adjustments that is the message that you sent to your sis. Are you guys close? I know weddings are busy but I'm assuming you guys aren't mega close or she was feeling v hurt and uncomfortable to leave without even letting you know she was going, and for you not to notice she wasn't there. Idk how many siblings you have as well, I only have one sis so I would definitely notice if she had left my wedding but knowing my sister, I would assume she wouldn't stick about for the party anyway and would arrange a separate family dinner to spend with her anyway. But that's my fam and everyone's family is different. \n\nEdit: Also everyone saying grooms mother is automatically more important than brides sister is full of it and isn't considering the nuance of individual family politics. One wedding I went to had little to no relatives from the brides side of the family because she is estranged from them. My best friends stepdad was always going to walk her down the aisle instead of her birth dad, another friend has a complex tangle of parents and multiple step parents.

I get that it was your wedding day and lots going on but to not even know that she wasn\u2019t there seems odd. I mean it\u2019s your sister. Your sister also has very serious health issues. There were other ways you could have accommodated them both without making your sister feel like she was being put with other guests. Parents & siblings could have been on opposite sides of the aisle with your sister sitting furthest from your MIL. It seems like she was treated more like a regular guest than a sibling. I understand you wanting to cater to your MIL but it seems it was at your sister\u2019s expense so I can understand why family might be divided on whose side to be on. I mean both health issues could be serious but an allergic reaction I think is easier to treat than a cardiac event. Everyone I know who has severe allergies carries medication and an epi pen if case they feel an allergic reaction coming on. \n\nYou said you tried to compromise because of your MIL health issue but what about your sister\u2019s health/heart problems? I don\u2019t see where anything was a compromise for your sister. You had her sit further away from family at the ceremony and planned for her to be placed further away at the reception. What would have happened if your MIL & FIL had decided to stay until the end of the party? Would your sister have had to stay away at her table the entire time? \n\nIt sounds like your sister was (emotionally) hurt more than anything and felt like her own serious health problems & need for a Service Dog weren\u2019t taken as seriously as your MIL\u2019s allergies.

That being said, any venue that I've been in could have quite a bit of room between the furthest seat of the front rows. Since the dog would be sitting and waiting the hair wouldn't get into the air where she is. \n\nIt really depends on mil's level of allergy for if she is an ah. I'm allergic to animal hair as well. If she could take meds to help then she is an AH, as people who have service dogs would love to take a med to fix their issues. \n\nI don't blame your sister for being upset. She was upset for not feeling accommodated for her disability and she's not wrong. She got put into last position and pushed back due to something that she couldn't help. She will feel betrayed, and since there was no extra questions or push she knows that your finances family comes before your family. All that you can do is be calm and understanding when she doesn't want you as involved in her life and her milestones and chooses her friends as the trusted people.\n\nYour sister also knows that any future events at your house won't be service animal friendly, so unless you go out of your way to keep her around you could possibly ending a relationship with your sister unless you find a proper solution for family hosting. Sister and dog eat outside with your family and wife and her family are inside? Would that fly? It sounds like a steep slope of making everyone happy.", "NTA.  You made accommodations.  Dueling disabilities are a no win situation.  \n\nWe\u2019ve raised and trained Service Dogs for 20 years so I offer this observation.   \n\nIf your sister shows up for a flight with her dog and there is a severely allergic person on the aircraft, your sister probably won\u2019t be boarded.", "INFO: If your mil just left because she doesn\u2019t like party how is this compromising?

She had to wait until someone else left to be able to come near her sister. I'm sure she completely understands, but that doesn't make her feel any better.  Don't be surprised if you have limited or no involvement in her wedding, and little contact with her.  Just because the situation was necessary doesn't make the sting any less.", "YTA but not for what you think. Moving the sister was a necessity, then it is up to you to make her feel part of the group. I mean you didn\u2019t even know she left early. We\u2019re you not hanging out with her at all? No wonder she felt left out. \n\nAlso, why didn\u2019t anyone talk to a veterinarian or look it up on the internet. There are lots of ways to reduce the amount of allergens a dog or cat. You remove 70% of the allergens just bathing the dog right before the event, you will be removing all of the proteins from their coat. \n\nPeople aren\u2019t actually allergic to the animal. It is to the proteins in their saliva. When the groom themselves, the saliva dries on the fur and then enter the air. That\u2019s why the closer the animal is to your face the more it affects you. A \u201chypoallergenic\u201d dog or cat don\u2019t have the protein in their saliva. Sometimes thinking outside the box can open up a world of opportunities.", "I'm most troubled that MIL wasn't asked to make any concessions.

From the information we have here i would vote NAH \n\nINFO: did the sister have to sit amongst strangers for the ceremony and dinner as a result of this plan? was she given a plus one and told she could bring a friend to make it easier if she didn't have a partner? \n\nIf not I don't blame her for leaving. The tone of her night was already set as awkward and lonely. I'd leave too.  Nobody should be forced to be at a party. She stayed for the important bits and the bride didn't even notice she was gone. We also don't know there is a history of the sister feeling pushed aside by the bride that would make this just another instance of an unfortunate pattern.\n\nEdit: also a thought:  I don't know how much dancing a person can do with a service dog or heart condition severe enough to need it. If the first half of the night sucked I definitely wouldn't be game to hang around and watch people dance for the rest of it. I think that would also increase the feeling of being forced on the sidelines.", "NAH. You did your best to ensure that both MIL and Sis could attend.

Sister could\u2019ve said \u201cit just sucked that I had to be separate from everyone\u201d. That\u2019s a reasonable feeling to have. But it is not OPs fault that she felt that way and she shouldn\u2019t be saying it\u2019s her fault.", "That was the sister's choice. Sister is an asshole though for blaming OP for sister's feelings.", "Truth \ud83d\ude4c\nI had maybe 30 people at my wedding and I can't recall a single moment of our (*DRY*) reception. \nAll I remember is my husband and our families \ud83e\udd23\nI honestly remember much more about the rehearsal dinner and decorating the night before than the day of - it was beautiful, but a blur!!", "And I think the wedding couple just don\u2019t need to cater to everyone and talk to everyone in every corner. It is busy everyone\u2019s comes and wants to talk and socialise. And a wedding is the big day of the groom and the bride and not brides sister. I think this is the one day where you are the host of an event in which you don\u2019t need to cater and see anyone it\u2019s more that everyone sees and comes to you.\n\nIf the sister just sat in a corner waiting for OP to come and cater to her I would say that is sisters shortcoming. Especially when the wedding was a really big one. If you have 200+ guests you simply can\u2019t see every person even the ones who sit in some corners.

No. The sister still had a place to sit, was still invited with her dog, even with someone having a severe allergy. The OP didn\u2019t have to make an accommodations for anyone, but she still did. And planning a wedding is already stressful as it, and she did it because she wanted both of them there. The sister is only looking at the negative. Should OP had make her husbands mom sit in the back? No. That\u2019s her new family she\u2019s marrying into. That would\u2019ve caused a negative affect on her relationship with her in laws.

It was her choice because a party is not her thing", "No it wasn't. OP literally says she didn't ask MIL to leave early, it's just what they always do anyway.

I'm not passing judgement, just asking for clarification.\n\n>in a wedding the bride and grooms parents always have a place of higher importance than siblings.\n\nThat's entirely dependent on the family dynamic.

I'm severely allergic to dogs, so I avoid them, as my regular allergy meds won't be enough.  I would have to add Benadryl, which can put me to sleep, especially when combined with alcohol.  Still, in this situation, I would probably take a Benadryl with a tall glass of strong tea.", "I mean yeah she could have had a medical emergancy, in the event that happened I doubt they'd have continued with the wedding and ignored her? I'm guessing OP would have planned for such a scenario and in the light of a life threatening emergancy the MIL would have stepped aside so that the proper medical attention could have been given.", "So? What if they aren't that close and the sisters are? I know it's a moot point going by the fact she didn't notice her sister wasn't even at the reception but still. Point is, it's different in every case.", "The ADA is a broad law. A lot of the specific \"ADA rules\" are based on court case rulings.

But her owner mentioned that she was trained to help him with his heart condition- I just didn\u2019t have the time to ask him to elaborate. \n\n\nAlso as for OP\u2019s awareness of her sisters attendance, I definitely agree with you there. I also can\u2019t imagine why OP didn\u2019t even notice that her sister had left. Why she had to be notified of that is beyond me.", "Eh, depends on how severe the allergy is. I have a coworker, for instance, who has an airborne allergy to shellfish. Even if she doesn\u2019t touch it, she can have a very severe anaphylactic reaction.  Shellfish is banned from our work area entirely.

Maybe if they were a member of the bridal party.", "I'm not sure of the details. Can a pulse monitor watch also work?", "And it's not possible to take a pulse monitor watch for the evening? Maybe so? Maybe not? \n\nI'm supportive of official guide dogs but there are limits to accommodation.", "That\u2019s why I said, \u201cif it is possible\u201d because sometimes it is not.", "With that degree of reaction, allergy medicine probably wouldn\u2019t have helped. An inability to breathe and anaphylaxis is probably as dangerous as whatever heart issue the sister has. Asking the mom to take meds and deal with whatever the fallout is from them probably not working or having to deal with an epipen because the sister is being a brat is just as bad as if OP told her not to bring her dog. OP had a conflict where compromises had to be made. Lesson learned, sister would rather leave and complain than be happy for OP, so now there\u2019s no obligation to invite her to anything that MIL will be at.

Not to say that makes you a bad person and it sounds like life has been very unkind to you. I hope you can work through those feelings and I wish you the best of luck.", "They were more than accommodating about the sister's dog. She didn't have a reason for feeling left out. It sounded like they were fair to both people involved. That being said, I hate the \"Just take an allergy pill and you'll be fine\" attitude a lot of people have. I think because they don't have allergies themselves, they don't realize how bad it is for those of us who do.\n\nI have allergies. I take multiple prescription meds daily. That's without being exposed to things like animal hair, dust, pollen, grass, etc. etc. Exposure to things like that mean itching, wheezing, sneezing, coughing, eyes watering down my face while I'm struggling to get air into my swollen throat. I already take multiple pills, daily inhaler, nasal spray, and use a rescue inhaler. I carry benadryl and cough syrup in case of an sudden attack. Believe me, if there was some magic pill I could take that would fix everything, I would take it!\n\nI love my sister. She's kind, sweet, caring, and one of the least selfish people I know. She knows I'm allergic to cut grass, but forgets. She likes her lawn to look good when people come over. She will invite me to a bbq, then mow literally half an hour before I come over. It's brutal, to the point that I just don't visit her anymore.", "This is an odd comparison. People with metal allergies don't react unless they're touching the metal.", "Allergy medicine won't stop a severe reaction, and severe reactions can be fatal. Imagine asking someone who throat closes up with peanuts to just take a benedryl if peanuts are around....doesn't work. Even outdoors, the MIL still can't be close to the dog so nothing would have changed. Also, hypoallergenic dogs are kind of a myth. A \"hypoallergenic\" is just a dog that generally produces less saliva and dander than other breeds. But all dogs obviously have saliva and dander and can cause a reaction to someone allergic, especially someone severly allergic.

This women clearly cares about her sister\u2019s feelings, I highly doubt that she would have been upset if other members of her family sat with the sister to make sure she had people to share her excitement with too.  \n\nThe bride didn\u2019t do anything wrong obviously but I feel like other members of the family should have been more considerate.", ">my other sister to be all by herself.\n\nNo one is sitting by herself. Stop making up lies.", "I guess I'm very confused by the issue that you and the sister are presenting. Why can't the sister sit with other family members and friends? All I see is that the sister is upset she is not at the main table. What am I missing?", "Ok. I would go sit with my sister so she wouldn\u2019t feel left out of the family. As I said, my other sister would understand because she\u2019s a mature, logical person and would see it as a way to facilitate a solution. \n\nI just recently went to a wedding where the bride and groom sat at a small table and their families were distributed among other tables. There isn\u2019t only one way to do a wedding. I didn\u2019t even have tables at mine.", "She was asked to sit farther back during the ceremony.  This was about her treatment at the wedding not the reception.\n\nThe sister who is new to having a service animal, and likely still somewhat insecure about bringing her dog places and facing questions/states was isolated during the service and opted not to go to the reception.  My point is other family members should have sat with the sister to make sure she felt included in the day/family too."]}
