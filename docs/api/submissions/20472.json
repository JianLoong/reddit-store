You did everything you could to accommodate both your sister and your MIL. \n\nYou were caught between a rock and hard place: the dog is medical equipment for your sister so the dog needs to be present. But your MIL experiences breathing difficulties and other issues due to a dog allergy. Your MIL needed to be front and present to see her child get married; as far as seating is concerned she would take precedence. \n\nYour MIL also stayed for only one hour at her child\u2019s wedding reception. One. Hour. That\u2019s it. Sounds as if she was more than accommodating. \n\nYour sister should appreciate what you did.", "NTA.\n\n\"So, good sister, what should I have done? Force my husband's mother to go through severe allergic reactions during her son's wedding, all so that you could sit a little closer? Is that what you wanted me to do?\"", "NTA, your accommodations were more than reasonable.", "NTA \n\nCongratulations on your marriage! \n\nYou did your best. And it sounds like you had a good plan in place and everyone was included. I know it sucks at the moment because your sister feels bad, but like I said you did your best and I feel with time she will be OK with that.", "NTA. You did what you could to accommodate two important guests with health issues. Unfortunately, MIL takes precedence, the wedding was for both you and your husband, not just you. You even told her she would be welcome closer at the party after an hour, it was on her for leaving.", "NTA\n\n>I called her up to talk and she said I made her feel left out and bad by having to take her service dog, preferring to make her totally uncomfortable for my MIL's sake\n\nYour sister is being incredibly selfish. Yes, she needs her service dog for her health, but the dog would've made your MIL seriously unwell. This was a very tricky situation for you to manage and if you hadn't made these (entirely reasonable) arrangements, one of them either would've been in medical danger or excluded entirely from your wedding. So, what exactly did she want you to do? Rescind your MIL's invitation? Tell MIL to suck it up and suffer through severe allergic reactions to the dog?\n\nSister is going to have to understand that she isn't the only person in the world with a condition that requires accommodations, and there may well be other occasions in the future where she isn't able to be front-and-centre at events because of someone's serious allergy to dog fur.\n\n\\[EDIT\\] Apparently I suck at reading today and totally skipped over the fact OP had to be told by someone that her own sister wasn't at her wedding reception.\n\nThis is very strange, OP. I personally would notice my sibling's absence at an important event like this and I'm now starting to wonder if her comments are coming from deeper feelings of being pushed aside by you. Can you elaborate on that?", "NTA - your sister and your MIL have just the same rights to be there and celebrate with you and your husband. \nIt seems to me you really planned this out and did your best to accommodate so just remember that. I understand your sisters health complications - but in the nicest way possible it\u2019s not your problem and you did your best to ensure everybody you love and wanted there, was there. \n\nCongratulations anyway! You did what was right for you on YOUR special day", "NTA. I can understand sis saying she felt YOU were leaving her out. Please reiterate that your husband was THE OTHER most important person in your wedding, and he deserved his mother there. When push comes to shove, parents take precedence over siblings. You made the right choice - as much as you love and would maybe even die for your sister, you were not marrying her.", "NTA. Short of your sister attending via Skype and having her portions delivered beforehand, this is about the only reasonable solution I can think of to accommodate both parties.", "NTA \n\nYou tried to make reasonable adjustments for both people, unfortunately you\u2019ll never be able to please everyone", "NTA. This is pretty open and shut, you made a compromise, thought everyone agreed to it, then learned after the fact that your sister wasn't okay with it. If she had issues with the arrangement, it was her responsibility to say something, and she didn't.", "NTA. One of the challenges with accessibility things is sometimes different people's needs are at odds. In your case, it's the dog your sister needs for her health and your MIL's severe allergies.\n\nYour sister is allowed to feel how she feels, but what makes an AH and this not N-A-H is she needed to share this. There weren't any easy decisions to make, and I think you made the best one given the circumstances", "NTA- your sister is being unreasonable, but I'd chalk up her reaction to the adjustments she's having to make to her new reality (needing a service dog). She needs to get used to the fact that this means she is now going to be excluded from some things to a lesser or greater degree because of this disability. Same would be getting used to being in a wheel chair, it may not be exactly fair, but compromises were made on both sides.", "You were in a complete no-win situation. Your compromise and solution was as fair as you possibly could be. I\u2019m sorry OP.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Why?  All things being equal (assuming your MIL is not a nightmare) mother of the groom should always trump siblings. This is her son. She has roles to play that are meaningful to both her and her son. Your sister was a guest.  Prioritizing a guest over the groom\u2019s mother, even during the reception would have been a recipe for future conflict with your MIL. That you made compromises to try and accommodate for both is something your MIL will remember in a positive way.  \n\nI get your sister felt left out.  While she does have a right to her feelings, it\u2019s not reasonable to expect you to damage your relationship with your in-laws just to make sure your sister got all the warm fuzzies she wanted. \n\nAt the end of the day, a wedding is essentially a tiered event. At the top is the bride and groom, then the parents.  These are the main characters. Everyone else is there to celebrate the union and are there as supporting characters.  \n\nAgain, all things being equal and assuming little to no drama between people, the reality of life is that when you marry, that becomes your immediate family.  You and your husband are the center.  Everyone else exists in ever expanding circles around that\u2026parents, siblings, aunts and uncles, etc.  \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to apologize for doing what you thought was a reasonable way to accommodate the GROOM\u2019S MOTHER while also including your extended family.", "NTA, having a potential alergic reaction definitely trumps feeling uncomfortable.", "NTA. You did the best you could to accommodate both of them. If she\u2019s mad that she wasn\u2019t prioritized over your husband\u2019s months that\u2019s her issue.", "How did you not realize that your sister didn\u2019t attend the reception until after the honeymoon? A\n\nYour sister has a heart condition that is sever enough that she needs a service dog. \n\nAlso wondering why your sister wasn\u2019t in the wedding. But, ultimately this was difficult to navigate", "NTA. I think you did the best you could in this situation. I really don\u2019t know what she expected you to do.", "NTA - you took reasonable steps to accommodate your sister\u2019s disability and your MIL\u2019s allergies. both are equally deserving of special accommodations.", "A service animal might be importand, but it is not a death or life thing, an allergy as severe as you described is.\n\nAnd your sister was only for 1 hour not in the center of the party.\n\nYour sister sound like one of that middle agled ladies with angled bob, yelling for a manager coz her emotional support alligator is not allowed in the babypool without muzzle.\n\nNTA", "NTA but I can see how she is feeling pushed aside because of her medical condition. So my question is will she be excluded from any family gatherings that mil is included?", "Definitely not the Ahole! You did everything you could to accommodate them both", "Nta but if she had a problem she should have made it known before the wedding", "NTA. I feel for your sister, unfortunately your MIL's allergies are serious enough to be a real concern. Your sister needs her service dog, this is her new reality, and, unfortunately, part of that reality is that she will have to deal with people who have severe allergies to dogs, and she will have to make accommodations for these people, just like people who aren't allergic to dogs will have to make accommodations for her.", "NTA you made a reasonable plan that met everyone's needs.  Your sister is an adult who made a choice to \"leave herself out\" from the event and is now trying to paint herself as the victim.  Ask her directly what SPECIFICALLY she was expecting for you and your husband to do?  Does she honestly think having EMS show up at your wedding while your MIL was in anaphylactic shock?", "I'm gonna be honest: this is a pretty complicated situation. You appeared to try to split the difference in this, but I completely understand the sister's situation and feelings since there is a service dog involved and she does have heart problems, as you described. From her perspective, it could be seen as treating her differently in a negative way because of her complications. She's entitled to those feelings as she probably felt ostracized, as evidenced by pushing here further back from the first row during the wedding and even at the party.\n\nBut also the mother-in-law being allergic is a big deal since you don't want to deal with that medical side of things, either. It's tough. It really is. I don't think anyone's the asshole here.\n\nYour sister is allowed to feel the way she does. The only thing I do wonder about is why wait until after the honeymoon to call and talk to her about it? I'm not saying this is the case but in your sister's mind that could once again confirm a preconceived notion to her that her situation is not being accounted for adequately.\n\nEither way, I hope you all are able to move on from this and have a healthy relationship.", "Looks like I\u2019m going against the grain a little, but YTA. You didn\u2019t compromise or split the difference at all. Both people had health issues that meant they needed to be apart, so you chose to separate your sister in all instances, that\u2019s not compromise. You left your sister out which is why she felt left out.", "YTA - one should have sat far away at the ceremony and one at the reception.

NTA", "[deleted]", "I mean, the sister\u2019s hurt feelings are valid. It really sucks. I feel for her. But OP was in a tough situation. Parents of the bride/groom trump siblings of the bride/groom.

Antihistamines only help so much.", "Absolutely, which is why I said I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s the asshole here. It\u2019s one of those situations where someone is going to feel left out, and obviously the sister (rightfully so) feels that way. It\u2019s made worse because of the medical situation.\n\nI tremendously sympathize with the OP on this because whatever they decided would have resulted in someone feeling left out on a very special and important day. The main thing I mostly have questions about is why wait until after the honeymoon to get in contact with the sister about what ended up transpiring. But I also get it. A lot is going on at that time.\n\nI\u2019m mostly fascinated by this situation because of the dynamics involved \uff0d i.e. health issues on both sides, mother-in-law leaving early regardless, call after honeymoon, etc. It\u2019s truly a \u201cdamned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t\u201d endeavor.", "I mean whatever, but don\u2019t say I compromised and did everything I could.

Whatever gets decided leaves someone excluded, even if it's not perceived to be that way. The mother-in-law obviously has to be up at the front, but so should the sister.\n\nIt just feels pretty tough to punish (for lack of a better term) the sister twice \u2014 once at the wedding and then again at the reception \u2014 for her medical situation. Even with the mother-in-law leaving after an hour. It makes the sister feel less-than, and calling *after* the honeymoon probably just reinforces that thought in the sister's mind.\n\nI don't know what the OP should have done, but the sister absolutely isn't in the wrong here, which should be made clear. And for anyone wondering why the sister didn't bring up how she felt before the wedding, the OP states she did. The sister likely accepted it just to appease and not make waves until after everything had passed, allowing the OP to have their day without worry.\n\nI originally commented about this, but it really is a very complicated situation.", "Have one sit away at the ceremony and one sit away at the reception.", "[deleted]", "It\u2019s a compromise from the alternative which is saying that the service dog can\u2019t come due to the allergy which would have been an awful outcome", "Seriously. The mil should have been chosen over the sister all day long. She is an actual part of the wedding party while the sister is more or less a guest.

You were more than accommodating for both and made sure both were included. You still allowed her service dog to come but at a safe distance. Your sister has to understand that you did what was best for everyone involved and you weren\u2019t isolating her on purpose.

Please trust me on this one.", "I agree with you but she was kind of forced to share it when OP called her up to ask why she left. I think sister is entitled to her feelings.

But I do understand sister feeling isolated and left out.", "I mean. In her defense, her sibling (OP) called her to talk, so it's possible she shared this because she was asked.", "She was not excluded, they worked seating, so they were not close to each other.  There was a sibling table and a parent table.  Both women had medical conditions.   The main issue is the dog detects if one has a problem, but the dog will send the other to the ER in the middle of the wedding.", "Probably.\n\nBut she is not related to OP's MIL so unless the occasion involves OP's children, there shouldn't be a problem for them not  to be invited to the same events.", "That is actually a very good question.

Dog is medical equipment, shouldn\u2019t have to leave persons side for any reason. I think OP accommodated as best as she could. Please try to consider that a service dog is medical equipment, not a pet who can be left behind at home.

He\u2019s a medical device to her.", "While I agree with you, important to rephrase this. Moms allergies don\u2019t trump the service dog. The service dog is a piece of medical equipment, not a pet. That\u2019s like saying moms Epi-pen trumps sisters heart monitor. \n\nBride did the best she could to accommodate both of them. Maybe sister could have come after MIL left the party to enjoy the rest of the night. Sounds like she was sulking about feeling left out instead of compromising and coming after. Her loss.\n\nI personally don\u2019t think either party is the AH so NTA to either. Sister has every right to feel left out, she is entitled to her feelings and I can understand her feeling that way, it was a serious bummer that she had limitations at the wedding due to her medical condition. So did MIL, she probably had to be sure to stay away from certain areas that sister was in. She has every right to voice that to OP, and as long as it was done nicely, that\u2019s healthy, she needed to make her feelings known to OP. However I think she needs to understand (and maybe OP needs to be sure to express) how tricky the situation was and that her service dog could\u2019ve inflicted actual harm on MIL. Just as her service dog not being there could\u2019ve inflicted harm on her. Hopefully after things settle she understands that OP did the best she could with the conditions she had. That was very tricky and I think it was handled with as much grace as possible.

She knew she could move freely one hour into the reception, once the MIL with the severe allergy had left, as promised, which is exactly how things played out, but she made her own decision to leave the reception before that could happen.

Sitting on opposite sides in the front row in most churches would be as far apart as sitting a few rows back. That is just my first and most obvious thought upon reading it. I\u2019m sure if someone actually cared they could have come up with something. The fact that the mother in law would leave after all of the important family stuff was done at the reception and you can come around after that is some small comfort."]}
