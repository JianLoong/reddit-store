My wife will do that once in a while and I find it very annoying.

Let me tell you what I\u2019ve learned: people do NOT have proper grammar when speaking. Even the  most educated people use partial sentences, wrong verb tenses, and incorrect sentence formatting when speaking. On paper, I\u2019m sure their grammar game is strong, but spoken word is so different. It\u2019s a more relaxed way to convey messages. I never really realized this until I started doing what I do; I spend so much time trying to figure out the best punctuation for help clean up bad grammar. It\u2019s insane.  All that to say, I\u2019m sure your wife is teaching properly. Speaking as a teacher and speaking as a wife at home are two different things.

I'm a novelist! I live for words, and this quirk of his drives me nuts. I used to correct him, in part because I thought he just didn't know the right word and I didn't want him to say the wrong word in front of someone else and be embarrassed by his mistake. But no matter how many times I correct him, he can't \"fix\" it any more than I can change my eye color. He's dyslexic, and word swapping is common in dyslexics. Correcting him just made him feel bad about himself, and he began to resent me. Luckily, he explained to me how he felt and I took the time to understand what was happening. I still cringe inside when he says the wrong word, but I don't correct him because I know how damaging it is. And I know it's something he can't help doing, so why would I make him feel bad about it?\n\nI'm not saying your wife is dyslexic or anything.

I didn\u2019t see it that way, and feel that it isn\u2019t really out of the norm to correct someone you\u2019re close with, especially when it\u2019s such a basic mistake. Also, she is a 4th grade teacher, so it is kind of her job to teach others proper grammar. \n\nSo, AITA for being a grammar nazi?

Knock it off and apologize.", "YTA, but I\u2019m going to give you a slightly different perspective on why. (On top of what everyone else has said.)\n\nWhen you focus on grammatical errors in conversation with your wife so you can have the \u201cgotcha\u201d correction, you\u2019re also telling your wife that you\u2019re listening her to correct her. Not to communicate. \n\nMaybe that\u2019s not what you think you\u2019re doing, and maybe that\u2019s not how you intend to come across. But I can almost guarantee that\u2019s how you\u2019re being perceived.\n\nI have a sibling who is like this. (He\u2019s not ND.) Not about grammar, but about things that are equally as unimportant, patronizing, and dismissive. \n\nI\u2019ll give you an example so you can hopefully understand my point. I once was telling my brother that I was upset that he blew me off and left me waiting for over an hour at a restaurant where we were supposed to meet for lunch because he ran into a friend at Starbucks just before and didn\u2019t bother to text me to let me know he\u2019d be late.\n\nHe completely derailed the conversation to say, \u201cit wasn\u2019t a friend, it was an ex-roommate. And yeah, we\u2019re *friendly* but we weren\u2019t friends *first* so that definition isn\u2019t correct. And it wasn\u2019t an hour and a half I kept you waiting. It was an hour and twenty minutes. I *checked the time* when I pulled up\u2026\u201d\n\nNow, what was I trying to communicate, and what did he focus on? Did the *exact* definition of who he blew me off for matter? Did the precise number of minutes change a single damn thing about why I was upset? Did he focus on the message I was trying to convey? Or was it the pedantic accuracy of irrelevant details?\n\nNow apply that logic to your conversations with your wife when you do this. What message are you sending her? That you\u2019re interested in the *content of her communication* and actually listening and communicating with her? Or that she\u2019s going to be quizzed on her grammar later, so she needs to bone up for the final exam you\u2019ll spring on her any minute?\n\nAs a final note, I will say that I don\u2019t speak to that sibling as much anymore. It\u2019s exhausting having to approach every conversation like a cross-examination. (And I say that *as an attorney.*) Particularly when the cross-examination feels more like the point than actually being *heard.* \n\nUnless you want your wife to start second-guessing whether she should speak to you to avoid these petty, irrelevant corrections, reconsider how you communicate with her. Because when you do this? *You* are actually the one failing in communication. Not her. After all, you completely understand the message she\u2019s conveying to you. You\u2019re just ignoring it and derailing the conversation to focus on semantics. \n\nIf you love your wife, *listen* to the content what she\u2019s saying and let the form (I.e., the grammar nonsense go). Your her husband. Not her grammar tutor.", "I have an English degree and when people butcher the English language it is grating to my ears.

My family still corrects colloquial usage, and it makes me feel as if I can't speak with them openly. YTA.", "I'm seeing a lot of YTA here and I feel it's a bit harsh.\n\nWhen I was growing up and I would mispronounce words or make grammatical errors, my father would *always* correct me.  I never resented this, I like the English language, I like to write, and I was always happy to be corrected because I learned from it.  I don't think it's fair to assume that OP is correcting his wife because it gives him some kind of \"I'm correct\" boner and that's a horrible leap to make.  My dad corrected my grammar because he wanted to help me develop and improve my speech and literacy.  When I was very young, I used to pronounce my \"R\"s as \"W\"s, and my dad sat with me and taught me how to pronounce the words correctly and I have always appreciated his input.\n\nAll of you condemning OP for a \"need to be correct all the time\" are jumping the gun.  It is, of course; a huge shame that OP's wife broke down into tears about the correction, but then if OP has been doing this correction thing for years and *only now* his wife has reached a breaking point and had to cry about it, then surely she's been sitting on a level of resentment about it for years and has never said anything about it?  That's not fair in a relationship, you shouldn't sit on a problem and use it as ammunition later down the line.\n\nAll I'm trying to say is that I see a lot of these comments assuming the worst of OP, that he has a need to be correct, or he gets a kick out of correcting his wife's grammar.  I would like to think that this is not the case, and that OP just sees it as helping, rather than hurting.  If she's hated this behaviour for ages, then she should have said something the first or second or third time it occurred.  Feelings could have been communicated and a happy compromise could be reached.\n\nI think it potentially speaks more to someone's insecurity or reluctance to accept constructive criticism than OP's need to be correct.  I ask you, what's wrong with having your grammar corrected? I'm sure OP isn't *trying* to be condescending, it's just being perceived that way. I appreciate that some people may be more or less uptight about this, but at the end of the day, what's wrong with informing someone of the correct way to phrase things? it helps them with communication, and it seems to me that communication is the root cause of this issue.\n\nAs a side note, I have been with my girlfriend for nearly three years.  I corrected her grammar once a few months ago while we were in the pub and she immediately explained to me that she didn't like having that done to her and that while she understands that I did it with pure intentions, it makes her feel bad.  As a result, I've not done it since and won't do it again.  *communication in relationships is* ***the*** *most important factor*.\n\nEdit: Grammar and punctuation, Ironically!", "Hey, grammar genius ... it's not \"off of\" this show, it's \"from\" this show.
