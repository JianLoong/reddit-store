We have previously had conversations where we promised to make each other maid of honor at our weddings (When we were teenagers, but she still remembers). I have know this girl since primary school and she is probably the friend I see most often and keep most in contact with. However I feel that we have drifted apart in recent years, as she is not respectful towards my fianc\u00e9 and stepdaughter.\n\nShe has always been very negative towards my relationship ever since the beginning. When I first started seeing my boyfriend, I was 22, while he was 28 and had a daughter from a previous marriage. The age difference never bothered me, but she claimed it was inappropriate and that there was a reason \u201che couldn\u2019t get girls his own age\u201d. She has never been very friendly towards his daughter (8), and when I talk of her and her accomplishments, she makes remarks about how I\u2019m not her mother and she thinks it\u2019s weird for me to attend arrangements at her school or soccer games etc. I obviously know I\u2019m not her mother and that she has a kind and loving mother in her life, but still love and would do anything for her, and feel disrespected when she says these things, like i am wrong to try to be there for my stepdaughter.\n\nWhile she was exited about the wedding, she also asked if I was worried no one from his side would come and that the gifts would be cheap as it is his second wedding. She also claimed that it would be weird for his daughter to attend the wedding, however I think her problem is that she does not want children there to stop her from drinking.\nShe claims that she is only worried about me jumping into things and that I am not ready to be a stepmother at a young age, but she herself had a daughter at 23 (with a man 28). Her baby daddy also has a new girlfriend who is younger, that she does not want involved in her daughters life at all, so I feel like she might take this out on me.\n\nWould I be the a-hole for not making her the maid of honor and instead going with my sister-in-law or cousin who are more supportive of the marriage? I think it will offend her a lot and possibly end the friendship.", "created_utc": 1686758776, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149bq8k/wibta_for_not_making_my_oldest_friend_maid_of/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

While it is fair to ask why girls his age wouldn't date him, that's typically to help point out issues that can be less immediately obvious (ie emotional immaturity, narcistic behavior, etc.). The pretty obvious answer here (why won't 28 year old women date him) is that he has a child from a previous marriage. I turn 30 this year and know I would hesitate to enter a relationship with someone who has a kid because I, personally, am not ready for that. You are not me, though, and entered this relationship knowing his story and have been together, happily, for 3 years. Your friend sounds like she has her own personal issues to work through and is projecting what happened to her on to you. Because of this, it won't matter what you say to her, how your partner is different from her past partner, etc. so it's better to find someone who will lift you up on your wedding day, not dealing with someone looking for ways to tear you down. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA possible way to side-step the issue is do what you suggested in your post, have MOH be a sister-in-law or cousin, etc. and say that you didn't want any competition/hurt feelings among your friends so you chose a family member. Another way is to not have a MOH at all and instead just call them the wedding party or bridesmaids, but this is less typical so you might get questions from other people just FYI. Whatever you choose, this day is about celebrating you and your partner's relationship and future and I wish you luck and happiness :)", "NTA if not making her a maid of honor ruins the friendship. I would consider that a blessing in disguise really because she sounds toxic and miserable.\n\nI really think you should just go NC with her. If she\u2019s unfriendly towards your future SD. She\u2019s going to be a whole lot worse after you get married. \n\nHer shitty attitude towards your daughter is disgusting. I feel sorry for her kids because she\u2019s projecting her toxicity on them.\n\nMy husband had a coworker who\u2019s ex-wife sounded just like your friend. They had a daughter and got divorced before she was even a year old. He got married when his daughter was 12 and ex-wife took an instant hate to her. She told her daughter that she didn\u2019t have to listen to her stepmom because that\u2019s not her real mom. She even told her to call her stepmom a bitch. This woman was a real one lunatic. \n\nBut karma got her. Her daughter has a close relationship with her stepmom and ended up being estranged from her mom when she saw just how toxic her mom really was. Her bio mom got into drugs really bad and eventually took her own life by stepping in front of a car on the freeway.", "NTA. \"You don't seem very supportive of my relationship so I think someone else should do it\" should be good enough.

Why does she think you'll reward her behavior by being the MOH???", "NTA but understand that she\u2019ll be devastated. Maybe have a conversation about whether she really wants to be the MOH, why you have reservations and tell her it\u2019s 100% okay if she doesn\u2019t want to be the MOH given how she seems to feel about the situation.  She may not realize how you are taking her comments. Out of respect for the friendship I\u2019d give her a chance to think about things.", "NTA\n\nAnd I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re still friends with this person. She is rude and unsupportive. And not even from a perspective of trying to help you out of a situation she thinks isn\u2019t good for you\u2014she\u2019s just being judgmental, from the sounds of it.  \nConsider this. If the only reason you hang onto this friendship is because of the fact that she has been in your life for a long time, and in reality you feel the friendship isn\u2019t actually good for you but you feel like you\u2019d be giving up on something you\u2019ve built over many years, this is called a sunk cost fallacy.  \nYeah, you\u2019ve been involved with this person for a long time, and time is a finite resource for a person, but that time has already passed and you\u2019re not getting it back anyway.  \nTake the time spent on this friendship out of the equation and look at what is left.  \nOnly then can you really consider whether this friendship is healthy for you.  \nAnd then you\u2019ll probably have a good idea of who you will choose.", "They do, she is a year older than me, which I why I feel like it was weird of her to comment on the age difference when both men were the same age. She might still feel like she is a lot older than me since we have know each other since we were 6 and the 1 year age gap is large when you are children, but right now the age difference between me and her is pretty small.", "She was a teenager.   Her \"friend\" is the AH for using something they said in high-school to guilt her.  Situations change when you get out of school and grow up.  Take a look at the promises and declarations written in your high school yearbook.  Do they still apply?", "If breaking promises made about hypothetical future life events, as a teenager, makes someone an asshole, then by your standards, most people are assholes. \n\nThat\u2019s what teenagers do, they dream, imagine and make promises about their lives. Most mature people understand that people change, lives change and relationships change, and don\u2019t hold themselves or others to teenage promises. A friend not being supportive of your relationship is a great reason to not ask them to be your MOH.", "NAH. She shouldn\u2019t have promised what she\u2019d do as an adult 6-9yrs in the future. The arse was the child making an unrealistic promise. I think the current woman is making the right choice that having a maid of honor who supports the relationship is more important than a childhood promise. However\u2014\n\nA classy move might be to bestow the title Maid Of Honor title to 2 or all 3 people under consideration and assign duties as appropriate to their supportiveness of her and the fianc\u00e9. Maybe the BFF\u2019s area if focus is helping her prepare hair/nails/makeup I.e. more her focused and less fianc\u00e9 and union focused. ;)", "I absolutely understand what you are saying and appreciate your opinion. It was obviously a dumb promise to make, and one I would never make today. As a teenager, a lot of us make dumb decisions, but I still said what I said and can be held accountable for it today if it hurts her feelings.", "Situations do change. But if you're not willing to be unreasonable with a promise, then making promises is pointless. The expectation, clearly, didn't change.\n\nTeenager could be 13. Or it could be 19.", "Yes. By my standards most difficult interpersonal decisions are morally grey, and involve some lesser evil (lesser assholeness).\n\nShe made a promise, and failed over the length of the friendship to manage the expectations around that promise enough for it to have changed. Breaking the promise is the right call and the lesser (even tiny) evil, but it's still evil. Sometimes it's best to be 'on some level' an asshole.", "No.  Expectations did change.  They changed for OP and, judging from her \"friend's\" behavior, her expectations changed too.  She felt that she could start behaving like a non-friend, but still make OP feel obligated to a hold to a friend promise from years ago.  If I were to say \"I'll always love you,\" to my fianc\u00e9.  Then years later she abuses and cheats on me, I am not being deceptive by falling out of love.  Promises can be made based on the emotion and current situation.   When those situations because of the actions of one, the moral contract is broken for the other.", "Why should she let someone this rude and negative even be in her life? The so called friend doesn\u2019t even seem to like the OP at this point.", "You\u2019re right the situation did change. OP wasn\u2019t expecting her friend to be a toxic piece of trash who is unfriendly towards her future stepdaughter.\n\nAlso the fact that she asked OP if she was going to be the MOH shows that she\u2019s worried about not being one because of her behavior.\n\nBesides who the hell asks to be MOH in a wedding. That\u2019s tacky and gross. That\u2019s like inviting yourself to a party.", "If nobody had an expectation of the friend being the maid of honor, then there would be no post to reply to. An expectation that's strong enough to be friendship ending -- and that's reinforced by a promise that one or both parties consider to hold some amount of weight.\n\nI think that OP should do what's best for her and invite the SIL or cousin.\n\nI'm not saying she can't or shouldn't break the promise, or that breaking it is the end of the world. But while breaking a promise is often a lesser evil, it's never 'no evil', and if you're being a bit evil, you're being a bit of an AH :P\n\nIf that changes, then promising anything is pointless -- and for some people it is. That's why some people's 'word' is held more highly than others.", "Where did I say anything that contradicts that? :P", "Nta this is just weird. Why would she want to help you celebrate your union to your husband if she doesn\u2019t even like the man?", "YWNBTA\n\n\n\nYour life, your wedding, your decision to have whoever you feel like as MOH. \n\n\n\nImo, reconsider inviting her, or at least hire security for the events that revolve around your wedding. Or even better, BOTH. You don't need unnecessary negativity or drama on your special day/event.", "NTA. I was done reading at she is not respectful.", "NTA. Sounds like a friendship that is in a death spiral anyway. Why would she want to be your MoH if she obviously does not approve of the marriage?", "INFO\n\nDo you really want this person in your life, much less have her as a friend?\n\nNot all friendships last into adulthood\n\nPerhaps this one has run its course", "NTA This is a habit, not a friendship.", "NTA but it won\u2019t make it easier. \ud83c\udf40\n\nETA. I wouldn\u2019t reverse judge her though btw. She may be giving genuine advice BECAUSE her experience. Don\u2019t blame it on her situation as projection - unless you\u2019re absolutely sure she\u2019s not just worried for you.\n\nI have a kid, I am not with the father, and I\u2019d not date someone with a kid. The coparenting drama is just a no for me - and have you read about blended families on this sub? That\u2019s a huge commitment. Kids are hard, the fact they\u2019re yours makes you committed from the jump and you have some pull in how they\u2019re raised. I know doing that plus dealing with an ex, the exes family/plans, and all that - for life - and childbearing (with no authority)\u2026not to scare you, she does have a point. And my closest friend is the one who tells me what others cannot. Be careful before you through the bestie out with the baby\u2019s bath water is all I\u2019m saying.\n\nSidenote to anyone wondering. I know it sounds hypocritical, I have a kid but avoid single Dads. It\u2019s slightly different in my case only cause I have 100% custody and oceans dividing me from anyone uncomfortable\u2026and I am super careful who I let in given the potential weight on them also. And I do date single Dads, they tell me they don\u2019t have that freedom to get away from the ex, their life plans are limited, they get unhappy in life\u2026it\u2019s a lot.", "NTA. Your wedding your choice", "Thank you for your support and good advice. I absolutely understand your opinion. A lot of my friends around 30 have also said they wouldn\u2019t want to date anybody with kids. It felt right for me, but like you said everyone is different. It\u2019s a big responsibility that requires a lot of work, and not everyone is comfortable with it.", "That\u2019s horrible. I have been very lucky that my husbands ex wife has been kind towards me and not have a problem with me being a part of my stepdaughters life, but I feel for the people who don\u2019t have that. I know my role and would never try to take her mothers place, and feel bad that stepparents are often seen as threats. I care so much for my stepdaughter and have a strong desire to be there for her in any way I can, and as long as she is comfortable having me in her life, she will always have a place in my home and heart.", "I do feel bad and know it will be tough for her. I think it will be upsetting to hear either way, but you\u2019re probably right that giving her the chance to explain before making a decision will give her the opportunity to make things better if she wishes to do so. Honestly I should have set clearer boundaries from the start and made it clear that she will need to make an effort to be nicer to my family if she wishes to be part of the wedding.", "Plus, your wedding is to celebrate the union between you and your partner, she's already shown (and still does show) she's super against it in the worst possible ways. \n\n\nAnd she's an Ah big time, for not treating your step-daughter politely. At the end, your step-daughter is only a kid who's done nothing wrong.\n\n\nAnd OP, so proud of you for being a lovely and supportive step-mom! \ud83e\udd70 Hopefully everything goes well!", "Is what I proposed possible\u2014instead of a dramatic. \u201cYou are NOT the maid of honor\u201d making 2-3 people maid of honor and having your oldest friend helping with things not involving the fianc\u00e9 like your hair, nails, dress, etc? I get you want friends supportive of your wedding taking on key roles, but you also probably don\u2019t want to lose or cause dissent over breaking a promise with a longtime friend. Someone who\u2019s been at your side so long probably has done many things right by you. Can\u2019t overstate how valuable friends who stick by you are if this has been her only blind spot due to her baggage. Worth some effort.", "It is definitely a good idea. The wedding is almost a year away, so I have not made a complete decision yet. But I feel like if she is going to be part of the wedding, I still have to talk to her about how she behaves towards my fianc\u00e9 and stepdaughter, and she would have to show them more respect."]}
