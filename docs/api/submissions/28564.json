We have now managed to get the last one out of university and out of the house. \n\nMy wife now spends her days gardening, walking our dogs, or taking care of the house. Every weekend she takes her parents grocery shopping. My parents are still very independent and do not require my physical help.\n\nShe also subsidizes  her parents grocery bill to the tune of $400-$500 a month. I know prices have gone nuts and they are good people and it doesn't affect our budget so I don't care.\n\nMy mom recently  told me that my dad has been putting off some dental work he needs because it is too expensive even with their insurance.  \n\nI gave them the money. Once again it's not a big bite out of our savings and will not affect our budget. \n\nMy wife had a problem with me gifting my parents the money. I told her to relax and that it wasn't a big deal. She says it is a big deal and that we should have discussed it first.  I asked her when we discussed buying her parents groceries. Or paying for her parents to come on vacation with us.  She got upset and said that she didn't realize I was keeping score.  I said I hadn't been until she brought up the money.  \n\nShe thinks \"it's different\".

I think you are justified. It looks like you can afford the bills for both side.  Therefore, there shouldn\u2019t be any issues.  \n\nYou both are good people.  Good luck.", "NTA.  Unless you are harboring some resentment that your wife has never contributed financially to the marriage.  I\u2019ve effectively been the sole earner for my family largely from the beginning.  I substantially subsidized my wife\u2019s parents financially for years.  But I don\u2019t hold any resentment about any of that.  And she doesn\u2019t object to unilateral financial decisions I may make that don\u2019t put our future comfort at risk.  Not all aspects of the partnership of marriage are equal and in need of discussion and explicit agreement, so long as both partners agree they are generally equitable.  Your wife may be sensitive to the fact that maybe her current contribution isn\u2019t quite enough, and inappropriately projecting that insecurity here.", "INFO: How long has she been subsidizing her parents groceries? Why did she pay for her parents to come on vacation? \n\nOf course she thinks it\u2019s \u201cdifferent.\u201d It\u2019s a big lump sum, which therefore seems expensive. So I can almost understand her wanting to discuss it beforehand. \n\nHowever, you said she didn\u2019t discuss paying for her parents monthly groceries (which add up - 2 years of groceries at the prices you list are the equivalent of your father\u2019s dental work). \n\nIt sounds like there needs to be more communication but I\u2019m going to go with NAH.", "NTA. Sounds like y\u2019all help out her parents regularly and it\u2019s no big deal so I don\u2019t understand her problem with it. If anyone uses the term \u201ckeeping score\u201d in an argument, it\u2019s generally the person who\u2019s had whatever advantage up until that point. My guess is she wouldn\u2019t have an objection if y\u2019all lump summed her parents $10k for a medical issue. I think you should just discuss large expenditures moving forward just so everyone has an understanding.", "NTA. Way too many commenters clearly don't understand how marriage works when they emphasize it's OP's money (note...OP has not taken this stance, just likely young commenters). \n\n\nThe problem here is that your wife does the same thing and doesn't see it as the same because it's not  a large lump sum. Simply reminding her of that is not \"keeping score\" it's pointing out hypocrisy. \n\n\nYou would both benefit from having a conversation on how exactly you want familial lending/gifts to be handled.", "Why is it \"different\"? I mean yes normally you would discuss things like that beforehand but if she's set the precedent to not do that then I can't see what her gripe is. NTA", "NTA, she is right and wrong with the \"it's different\" part at the same time. Yes, it is different, but in an opposite way. Given the sums of money mentioned her recurring spend is much worse than your one time spend. Her spending $500 a month will exceed the 10k you spent on your dad in just 2 years and will keep growing \"forever\". I believe both of the spends should have been discussed in advanced to avoid the conflict.", "NTA - It\u2019s not different.

If you've got that in savings and it's not affecting any plans, then it shouldn't be an issue.\n\nLots of couples pick a dollar value at which an expenditure needs to be discussed, so I get her point in that it's a big ticket item.  But that \"keeping score\" comment shows that she realizes you help her parents quite a bit.  She's not upset about the money, she's upset because you pointed out her hypocrisy.\n\nPS.  It is \"different.\" Because it's helping her parents vs. helping yours.", "There was JUST a post about a wife asking if she was the asshole for being upset that her husband gave his parents 10k.\n\nKarmabait post.", "NTA at all.  Most of the people voting otherwise takes issue with the lack of communication about finances.  I agree it's odd, but you two seem to be financially in a spot where you are quite comfortable, and that IS how you've dealt with finances.  You simply don't discuss it, and both of you spend money on what you want/think is important.  Helping your respective parents is important to both of you. \n\nYour wife has spent far more than 10k on her parents without talking to you about it at all.  It seems rather unreasonable and quite the double standard for her to expect that she can do it without any discussion, but you should not.  Her rules for thee but not for me attitude makes her quite the hypocrite.", "NTA. Sounds like there\u2019s plenty of money to be generous with both sets of parents. I think you and spouse should have a talk though so things don\u2019t escalate and there\u2019s understanding between you.", "NTA and it isn't different.  While I agree with the other posters that it is a lot of money, (I am sure that is the issue your wife had as well) $500 a month in groceries is $6k a year.  She is spending a lot in smaller doses on her parents.  You just gave a lump sum.  Yes, it would have been nice to let her know, but without it affecting your savings/lifestyle, I don't think that it should matter.", "NTA:  \"It's different\" is because it is for her and her parents. If you can go without commenting on her supporting her parents, she can go without commenting when you support your parents. That is only fair. She probably doesn't realize that her monthly spending on her parents has added up to close to the amount you gave your father as a one-time help.", "Yeah, NTA. She can't unilaterally decide to subsidized her parents groceries and one good trip out of the country is at least 5k for 2 plane tickets. She needs to mind the business that pays her..it's not like you gave them 10k to go to Vegas and gamble with.", "The only reason \"it's different\" is because it's your parents and not hers.

She didn't feel the need to discuss the smaller increments, maybe because they were smaller increments. She saw a lump sum, and it seemed like a big gift to your parents, and the size triggered her complaining about you not discussing it first.\n\nMaybe have a discussion that there's a limit for giving each year, like $10k, and anything above that needs to be discussed. That way, you don't have to discuss everything, but still agree on a reasonable level of help for either family.", "Nta she\u2019s keeping score too.

I lost my high paying corporate job in 2020 due to COVID, my wife went back to work. In the time I was working I supported, wife, kid, MIL and payed off my house.", "NTA/E.S.H was torn on this one. You all sound very comfortable financially but for most 10k is a substantial amount that should be discussed. But 400-500 a month + vacation expenses will exceed that one time cost fairly quickly. & if she didn't discuss that with you ahead of time it is fairly hypocritical. \n\nYou definitely need to take a step back and discuss finances but to me you're NTA since the standard has been set that it's alright to use shared resources to assist parents.", "It's not \"different\" and that's why your wife is so huffy.", "NTA, it is not different and it does not leave a huge hole in the budget as you say.\n\nYou should have informed her of that, but certainly not asked for permission.", "ESH. \n\nI don't care who the breadwinner is, I really could care less whether it's you or your wife. It honestly doesn't matter. \n\nThe problem here is neither of you communicate.

It is still better than paying for a loan. My husband understood.", "NTA... However, some discussion should take place when there is less tension so that you can be on the same page and keep the unity.

Bringing up how she spends her days now that she's retired from her job as a stay at home parent, as your children have all made it to their next step, is also an unnecessary detail designed to highlight a disparity of work/leisure, I guess, but again to lead back to the idea of: my money, I say how I spend it. \n\nI don't know if you have resentment about how money is spent and maybe you need to have a discussion around budgeting and finances in a transparent way? $500/mo on groceries is a discussion that needed to be had as partners, just like $10K on dental work is a discussion that needed to be had as partners. Not necessarily like, permission seeking, but just \"Hey, here's what's going on with my parents. Here's what I would like to do.

It looks like we can communicate better, let's talk about where our financial boundaries are.\" But you did the tit-for-tat game and no one ever wins those. \n\nShe sucks because she should have at least given you the opportunity to have input in her financial support of her parents if it's something she would expect of you, but again you're spending far more than she is and it was all at once and not spread out over time.
