They live 8hrs away from us by flight and it was expensive but we do it because holidays mean a lot and also to see my niece Rhu(5F). She is my world and I love her to death.\n\nFor this vacation her mom, my sister Mila(29F) was missing for most of our family gatherings and was spending time with her boyfriend and doing part time. We have a good relationship but was really worried that Rhu doesn't get time with her mom and angry that she just leaves her with all of us. She leaves in the morning and comes late. Apparently this has been going on for months. \n\nFor a brief context, she is separated from BIL and she wants a divorce and he wants to try. But she came back home because they were not compatible and it's messy. So since she is a single mother I send her allowances for her and Rhu and also for other housing expenses directly to her so she can give our parents Rent and focus on Rhu and have a smooth divorce.I send her a total of 10K and my fun money account which she has access to and uses. She sees a therapist and I get charged for this as well. \n\nAdditionally my husband pays for her divorce lawyers. We both work hard and are not rich but we are good enough.\u00a0 I know it's not easy what she is going through and have never questioned her when there are withdrawals. \n\nBut this holiday I was so mad at how she is and who she is turning into. According to mum, Rhu is missing her mum and has withdrawn so much. She has not been giving them rent, and not helping around the house and doesn't even take care of Rhu. Mom works and dad looks after Rhu until mom comes. They are also old and cannot really actively interact with her. My mum was upset at me for not helping Mila out financially as they are also struggling with 4 mouths to feed. I have never been angry as I was then. \n\nI observed her for a week and the second week I confronted her privately. She said being a single mum is hard and she is de-stressing. I called BS and told her what she has been doing with the money, but I'm glad she is working part time, but what is she doing with Rhu when she is comfortable and even more angry that none of the money I give is going towards Rhu or helping with her. \n\nShe stormed out of the room and said I am ruining the holidays and being judgemental and she is going through so much. I told her how dare she say that after I give her everything even when I don't have money left to buy new clothes for Christmas because I thought it was worth it, and if she doesn't stop and focus on Rhu then the money stops. I was so mad I forgot everyone could hear us. \n\nAll our parents heard it. I felt so awful for exposing all this but I was so mad. She called me an AH and so did my brother saying I should have picked a different time. Now that I am calm I feel I am AH for exposing her like that.

She will always expect someone to pick up her slack..", "NTA\n\nAlso is your (soon to be ex) BIL supporting Rhu? If he is then your sister isn't a single mother but actually co-parenting (or would be if she weren't a deadbeat herself)", "Tell her \"bite me\" from me.  I went through the same thing but still managed to parent my child and not mooch off the whole world or shirk my responsibilities.\n\nSend all the payments (good on you by the way) directly to the recipients instead of through her and cut the fun fund off.

Don't air dirty laundry I'm front of everyone. You should have a rational, compromising talk when both tempers are under control. It's your money and you can spend it or withhold it if you want. But going into a public argument with tempers blaring is not a good way to deal with any situation. You should have talked to her privately and she should spend more time with her daughter.", "NTA and for the comments of the parents, I wouldn't even give the parents money. I trust them to handle it, but I have the feeling that Mila will somehow talk them an ear off to get the money. Make something like a trust fund for Rhu.", "She asked for the money and I agreed until she gets back on her feet. The others we paid because she is my sister after all. But I am so scared she might spiral if we took the money away from her even more than she is now.", "I only know what she spends when she withdraws from my account. The other 10k I don't know and have never asked. Rent is only for utilities and food the rest for them both to just be as comfortable as they were before. I am just so co fused and don't know if I played a part in this.", "Yes this was the initial plan, but since Mila asked me first I sent her everything and assumed my parents knew about it all. And I don't even know about what's going on with the divorce only that the lawyers give us updates on custody and hearing dates because we are also working and really busy on most days. But I knew she won't be used to living without her almost ex husbands financial support so she gave me an estimate and I didn't even hesitate. Now I am not sure if she is even the person I thought she was, or if the incompatibility issues are true, or if she was cheating or what. The ex husband is coming down as well with their lawyers and ours in a few days that's when we will k ow what has been really going on.", "Yes I see that now but wishes I was less harsh and at least given her time to explain to me in private  but she just stormed out  she is my sister and I love her, and trust her and didn't think she would do something like this. But in a few days the STBXhusband is coming with lawyers so then we will know what really is happening. For the moment Mila is so tight lipped. But she asked me for 50usd and I was like let's talk first. She just stormed out. So unlike her. It's driving me nuts trying to think of ways to approach this.", "Yes this also hurt the most when my mom said she was disappointed in me and my brother for not helping Mila out. I was shocked and thats when everything unravelled and I was too shocked with all the news I was getting. But that one week before I really took the time to see her and how she was doing to check if it was my mom being the typical worried mom, because my sister has every right to party as well, and then she was so absent for Rhu and  even around us even though I rallied for her. And gave her the benefit of the doubt.", "I agree with you with the ESH  but also that we were not communicating about a lot of things which led to all of this. And she is a SAHM for years so knowing it will be hard initially, she seemed our help and advice and I blindly gave it to her. Now facing consequences.", "Yes it was the first thing I did the next day. Beyond ridiculous how this all unravelled and we are getting to know more info from the STBX BILs sis another version. So definitely changing finances.", "Thank you for the advice. That's really appreciated. We are still here and trying to resolve things. But this was requested by her initially and obviously she is my sister I wouldn't hesitate. My parents were managing and didn't want to say anything to me either since Mila is going through a hard time. I don't know what is going on but have to figure out before we leave. We extended our vacation so something has to be done . Ty for your advice.", "I think she does get support and I won't be surprised if that was the case so we are all meeting with him as well to discuss what is going on, but Mila doesn't want to see him or him to see Rhu. So he is bringing his lawyers and we are bringing ours in a few days regardless.", "No we discussed and this was what she said she would need for her expenses as well as for Rhu. I have never tried controlling her. Just so disappointed that Rhu has changed as a result. I think child neglect is just as awful and that's why I was so mad. So you also think better to remove all the funds?", "It's expected? She obviously cannot afford to party that often so she needs to learn some responsibility. Instead of using the money that was given to her to pay her parents rent and for her **daughters needs (like food)**, she goes out all day to party instead. She also uses her father as a free baby sitter. She's causing others financial stress. Sorry but she needs to do more than just spend more time with her daughter.", "So OP should've sucked it up and had a miserable holiday herself and continued to shoulder the cost of her sister's bad choices for the duration of the vacation so that everyone else, could have a good time? That's an asinine suggestion. \n\nThere's no good time to settle a beef like that, except here and now. OP was on point, and justified in her actions.", "The codependency is strong in this one. Therapy you need. \n\nIn all seriousness, you are not responsible for her misbehavior, and in fact, you may be simply prolonging the inevitable. She needs to fall on her ass sooner rather than later so she can pick herself up and fix the mess that is her life. It's not your job, nor responsibility, despite how much you love and care for her. She's taking advantage of everyone's good nature and their empathy to her situation - that she got herself into.\n\nThere's never a good time to address matters like this, you forced an opportunity and that's absolutely okay. It's not just about her, it's also about you, you have given her too much already to continue being a heel. \n\nCongratulations for standing up to her and calling her out!", "Maybe directly contribute to your parents for Rhu and shut down her nonsense. She seems so lackadaisical and cavalier with your money she neglects her child.", "Directly pay her rent and utilities. Give your parents the money for the food. My bet is she\u2019s either drinking or gambling it away.", "I'm sorry OP but you are directly encouraging your sister to behave this way. I know it's hard to see when you're in the middle of it; that's probably why you came to strangers to ask. \n\nMost everyone is telling you that you aren't helping your sister. If she's staying with your parents and has a part time job but is neglecting her kid, and not putting any money into the household THAT IS A RED FLAG. \n\nYou are absolutely free to do what you want with you and your husband's money but just because someone is family doesn't mean you should ignore the issues at hand. Family bonds, especially in many different cultures, are very strong and I do think that is an amazing thing most of the time. \n\nNot holding someone accountable is NOT love. When we truly love someone we are not supposed to stand by quietly while they crash and burn. Loving someone means you tell them the truth, set healthy boundaries, AND stand by them while they figure out what's right. \n\nIf you saw your sister about to be hit by a car or a train wouldn't you stop her? Just because the train is metaphorical here doesn't mean she isn't heading for disaster.\n\nPlease talk to your family and explain that you are willing to help your sister and her child but you are not willing to stand by while she destroys herself and her child. If you insist on paying for your sister's life make absolutely sure the money you give is being used to take care of her and her child \n\nSome people are self destructive OP. They don't automatically do what's in their best interest and they will even take their kids into that selfish place. You and your family need to address this- together.", "I think you should consider letting the child stay with her father if there are no concerns of abuse and see your parents at weekends or something. Your sister is emotionally neglecting her own child on top of the child already being in the middle of a divorce. This will cause the child all sorts of emotional and attachment issues throughout her life, unless she is . \n\nSomeone needs to put the child first immediately, stop your sisters free loading, she is an adult capable of working full time like so many other single parents. Let her live her single life on her own.", "I can see why you would feel that way about wishing you had confronted her in private, but there is a other version of that where confronting in private gave her more time to think and tell more lies/turn the family against you so they would think you were lying when you say you did send money.\n\nThe storming out makes me think she has no good explanations and she has to choose between standing there with her mouth open or storming off. Storming off is the least bad option for her because it still creates doubt that maybe she hasn't done anything wrong and is angry at the accusation. Staying to give a lame excuse with lots of pauses and \"er\", \"um\"s will make it obvious to everyone she is doing something wrong.\n\nI think if the STBX is coming with lawyers your best bet is to not approach her about it at all, give the money to your parents from now on, and just let it play out.", ">I was shocked and thats when everything unravelled and I was too shocked with all the news I was getting.\n\nI honestly don't blame you for how you reacted to this. I've seen a comment or two here telling you that you were the AH for confronting your sister about this at 'Christmas' (which it isn't; it's early December), but to be criticised by your parents after everything you've done for her while she behaves irresponsibly with impunity? Yeah, you were well within your rights to bring her to account and I would've done the same.\n\nYour sister needs to understand that you're being more than generous and having stipulations attached to giving her full access to *your* bank account is absolutely reasonable, so don't let her guilt you. Yes, she's going through a hard time with the divorce, but that doesn't give her a free pass to be an absent mother and abuse your good will. She is a mother and her child should be at the very top of her list of priorities, not her new squeeze.", "Yeah that's for the best. Another question but is your sister legally allowed to prevent Rhu from meeting her father? It doesn't sound like they've got a custody agreement and as a father he does have a right to see his child", "Yup, absolutely, 100%. \n\nMy brother is a red neck, gun toting, trump supporting dumbass. During the holidays I still get along with them. Because it isn't just about me or him or whatever problems we have, it's about everyone attending. \n\nI never said she had to continue to shoulder the costs, but the conversation itself could have waited.\n\nIf you don't like my opinion, that's fine, but I don't care to know either way.", "\u2728\ud83c\udfc6 My Star Wars award to you!!", "OMG OP please please please read this one!!!!", "Yes it is, also we were too busy to communicate and check up on what was really going on because we need to earn enough to enjoy the holidays right? And now it's just such a circus. A part of me still believes I may be responsible for her behaviour by not really checking on her, but she has been taking advantage and lying too! If we didn't address it then we never would have done it any other time where everyone was in the same place face to face. Thank you for giving my some strength because I was feeling like crap", "Yes this all happened because no one was communicating to each other about what was actually going on. We have to have a sit down and discuss finances.", "Which is so unlike her but I would understand why. But we all need to sit and discuss the divorce, finances and especially how to make sure Rhu is healthy again. Thank you, u should have been doing this first, but since Mila asked me direct assumed she would be handling things well.", "Yes, we all feel manipulated and on top of that she is with her boyfriend too. This was before we knew the divorce wasn't finalised yet. I'm sorry there's so much we are still unravelling from this. But you are right. It is something that will need to be considered", "Thank you for that perspective . We are all still a bit emotional so yes lawyer to lawyer is the best option.", "Thank you for the support.

She's proved she cannot be trusted with it so she loses it, Rhu being set up for later life is more important then whatever the money is being used on currently. \nYou don't even need to set up the trust, it's your money and your sister betrayed your trust with that money. She needs to understand you are being extremely generous and she is not entitled to a penny, she knew it was to be spent on Rhu but chose not to. She doesn't sound like a very good mother, sister or daughter.", "NTA. I learned from my sister that if you want to help people who aren't good with money/or don't trust them to use well, pay for item you want them to have. We gave our car to BIL instead of $ when his died, because we knew it wouldn't end well if we gave him cash. Also paid for MIL house taxes, carpeting etc as cash would have gone elsewhere.", "NTA. But STOP sending her Anything. From now on any money, if you still want to send any, goes straight to your parents who actually cares about your nice.

If you want yo help financially give the money directly to your parents.", "This. NTA. But don't give your sister another penny. Give it to your parents to help care for the kid and to help pay their bills. And talk to your parents about drawing a line. They will watch the kid while she is at work, and for the time it takes to get to work and back, but the mom needs to be home after that. They need to draw this line, so she doesn't keep taking advantage of them.\n\nAlso, is it possible she's having an affair, and that's what she's doing with her extra time? (Although I'm not sure if it's called an affair now, maybe just a relationship?)", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Is there a reason BIL isn't stepping in to help with childcare and supporting your niece? \nYou sound like the sweetest person but I feel like your family is taking advantage of you.", "Maybe consider getting therapy for Rhu. She is more than likely feeling  lonely and abandoned by her mom. She also needs some extra curricular to spend time with her peers and get a sense of normalcy. It will benefit Rhu and your parents if she has a healthy outlet and then your parents won't feel as bad for not being able to physically keep up.\n\nSome ideas: dance, theater, art, martial arts, sports.\n\nI hope Rhu's father is a good dad and she gets to live with him instead."]}
