We've been trying to keep our political differences out of our relationship, but it's becoming increasingly difficult as her family keeps making comments that I find offensive.\n\nLast weekend, we were at a family gathering, and her uncle started making derogatory comments about a minority group that I happen to be a part of. I couldn't stay silent anymore and spoke up to defend myself and others in the group. Her uncle became angry and started arguing with me, but I didn't back down.\n\nAfterwards, my girlfriend told me that her family thought I was being confrontational and causing unnecessary drama. She asked me if I could just let it go next time, but I feel like I couldn't just sit there and listen to someone insult me and my community.\n\nSo, AITA for speaking up against my girlfriend's family, or should I have just let it go to avoid causing drama?\n\nedit: Appreciate all the replies and it will help me make a decision.

Maybe you can explain clearly enough to your girlfriend for her to understand, but she has grown up hearing their rhetoric and will find it hard to change. You have a hard decision to make.\n\nNTA", "\u201cRecently\u201d is the key word here. Dating is for finding out if you\u2019re compatible. You are a minority. She thinks minorities she dates should ignore racism from her family to maintain her own comfort. \n\nIncompatible. Move on. \n\nNTA", "NTA!\n\nMaking offensive comments about a minority group and then accusing members of that group of stirring up trouble when they respond is such a classic conservative move. \n\nYou have every right to defend yourself and call out offensive comments made about you or others. Your girlfriend is also TA for not calling out her family and defending you.", "NTA. \n\nBut understand that this will be your entire relationship with this woman. Her family will be terrible to you and she will ask you to just let it go. She will not stand up for you. You need to decide if she's worth it.", "NTA.  And if she won't back you up here, she's not the one.", "NTA. Why do you even care to waste time asking about this?\n\nDating is the period of time you use to find out more about a potential partner (and by extension, their family).  You already know enough. You should have broken up with this girl on the way home.", "NTA. When her uncle started making those bigoted remarks against you and your community you stood up to him. That was the correct thing to do. Why does he get to express his feelings, ideas, prejudices etc but you can't respond when he does so?  \n\nYour girlfriend asked you if you could just let it go next time. If she doesn't understand why that is wrong on her part, you need to have a VERY serious conversation with her about what bigotry is and why it is wrong and that you cannot be expected to tolerate it. And that if she wants to be your girlfriend she needs to stop tolerating it as well. If not, well perhaps you need a different girlfriend. Good luck.", "Nta. Is this what you want to deal with long term.", "You're gf is a racist too. She agrees with them and doesn't want you to fight back.", "There's a couple of options here: \n\n1. Your girlfriend actually agrees with her uncle, she simply has the manners not to say so out loud in front of people who she doesn't know are likeminded\n2. Your girlfriend is so ridiculously passive and submissive to her family that she might as well be #1 for all the good it does her.\n\nAssuming you didn't overescalate this, you're NTA.  You shouldn't have to listen and nod along while your culture/community are degraded just in the name of politeness.", "NTA\n\nYou need to rethink your relationship. The uncle isn\u2019t the only racist in that family. It\u2019s very  likely that the others are talking behind your back or will soon. Unless your gf is prepared to go at least low contact with her family you are going to be constantly fighting with them.", "If he's being racist, it's because he's a racist, not because he's conservative politically. That is an important distinction to make. If you're upset because he's racist, then NTA. I'd be interested to know what he said.", "Be aware that these types of people are often violent and armed. I find it best to simply object and then distance myself lest people think I agree.", "NTA \u201cHey, that whole standing up for yourself thing? Yea don\u2019t do that\u201d I\u2019d leave someone if they spoke to me like that.", "NTA. Let\u2019s say this relationship goes the distance and your gf isn\u2019t actually just as bigoted as her family would you want potential mixed race babies being raised around these monsters?", "It sounds like it\u2019s not just her family that\u2019s the problem. Time to move on. NTA", "NTA, racism (even at its most minor form) is still a degrading thing to experience. If your girlfriend isn't willing to back you up on this then she might not fully respect you as a person, and that is a huge fucking problem. At the very least she should be willing to not attend family gatherings until the Uncle apologizes to you, and they at least try to stop being racist. Otherwise I would say to get out of there before you get hate crimed.", "I be warning fellow minorities man. Leave her ass. NTA. She already showed you who she is. She is on her uncles side to keep peace while he\u2019s free to demean your people. \n\nThink with your brain and not with your dick protect ya peace and drop the dead weight.", "NTA.  Your gfriend is used to this behavior & is clearly embarrassed by it.  But she is also an enabler.  She should have stood up to her family on your behalf.", "Bigoted comments are not a difference of political opinion or a matter of conservative vs liberal. It\u2019s possible to have a good faith discussion, even a heated one, without making derogatory statements. \n\nMost people would respect you for standing up for yourself, especially if you didn\u2019t become angry/insulting with the bigot. If your girlfriend doesn\u2019t, she\u2019s not worth it. NTA", "NTA. Your gf should have been proud that you stood up for yourself. The fact that she wasn\u2019t would be a deal-breaker for me. If, in her view, her uncle saying something derogatory about your ethnic group was no big deal; then she at least tacitly accepts that view - if not outright agree with it. Don\u2019t buy additional stress. Dump her and her family right away.", "NTA\n\nPolitics are a representation of our deepest personal, social, and spiritual values. If you happent to clash on that front, sorry to say, but you're not compatible. \n\nThere are only so many times you can avoid talking about it. It's gonna come out eventually, and the longer you wait, the the harder it's gonna be to leave when you figure out just how not compatible your different world views actually make you (sunk cost fallacy).\n\nSo you could try to start the conversation now, see if the basic values behind your politics can align in any way, or if there is a way you two can come to an understanding. Like, maybe she's not racist, she just learned it's pointless to argue about it with her family. Or maybe she is racist, but she can be open to learn about different perspectives and come to empathize with people who are different from her.\n\nOr maybe she is a raging covert MTG inside and you should run.", "NTA. \n\nThere may be a lot to like about this girl, but she pretty clearly has internalized the bigotry her family believes in and is clearly showing you that she will prioritize letting her family continue to be discriminatory instead of defending someone she is suppose to love and care for (meaning you). \n\nEveryone on this sub is going to scream break up with her and run. That is for sure the easiest thing you can do. But if you really do feel like you could see a relationship with your GF, you need to immediately have a very serious and potential painful conversation about expectations and beliefs going forward. Sometimes people just need to spend time with someone from a group they are intolerant of to realize the error of their ways. You could help your girlfriend and maybe even her extended family grow and become better people. But this is 100% a hill worth dying on and under no circumstances should you let your GF off with anything less than a total understanding that **both** of you find this kind of behavior abhorrent and **neither** of you will stay quiet if someone starts acting like her uncle did again", "YTA, but not for standing up for yourself.\n\nYour GF watched you defend yourself against a racist, and told you to stop causing drama.\n\nSo what is it that you 'really like' about your racist girlfriend, exactly?", "NTA but if I could offer some advice...\n\nI married into a racist family. My SO was/is an amazing person who has never agreed with any of his family's views. He was never close with them emotionally anyway due to other reasons. We still had a lot of issues in the beginning with him trying to appease both sides, then him being disowned for years, missing out on a relationship with his younger sibling etc. He paid a steep price to be with me. Things have calmed now and I'm/we're happy with where things are at with his family but it was many years of strife, rejection and hurt feelings.  \n\nI just wanted to say....she's probably not worth it and you probably aren't worth it either. Being with you is asking her to alienate her entire family, and no matter how wrong they are, it's still her family. If you marry her you won't be gaining a new family, just taking her from hers. At first you're so in love you don't care, but as the decades go by you really start to understand what you're both missing out on. \n\nBe aware that they will likely never change. There won't be a moment of redemption, of clarity where they realize how wrong their beliefs are. Having kids won't open their hearts. You (and your gf) will always be on the edge of the family, the black sheep, the aberration. \n\nI don't regret being with my SO but it's not a path I advise other people to take. It hurts, it's hard and it's forever.", "YTA\n\nDon't rock the boat. Your girlfriend didn't get to choose her family. You're just making life hard for her for no reason.

If you condone it....then you support it. Your girlfriend is just as awful as her family, she's just hiding it.", "I'm not saying YTA or NTA because there's clearly some context missing here. Part of what makes a relationship successful is sharing the same goals and views. It's not a requirement, but it makes things easier in the long haul. \n\nYou also didn't clarify what may have led to this, what was said by the uncle, what your response was, or what your girlfriend said specifically. Because you didn't clarify, I can say that your gf was justified in telling you to drop it and not create a scene. Not saying the uncle was in the right here, but the vagueness of the situation leads me to believe that there's some half truths here and that their political views caused you to look for an opening to begin an argument with a member of her family. Again, *not defending the uncle* but you two are dating, and you could've just as easily told her it was time to go and left the situation to avoid confrontation altogether.\n\nMaybe use this as an opportunity to discuss your concerns with her. Communication could save a lot of heartbreak in the future. Ask her how she felt about the situation, if she agreed the uncle overstepped, or if she thinks he didn't overstep, why. Discuss not going with her next time she visits that part of her family or when that specific uncle is there. Either way, context is important, and this is an opportunity to discuss your views compared to those of your gf and decide if the relationship will work out in the long term.", "Unfortunately if she expects you to back down when her family is being derogatory about who you are, and thinks you are the one being confrontational, then this is not the woman for you.\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nYou are a minority, yet she thinks that you should sit there and listen to insults?

When I was in my early 20s I started dating a very handsome respectful man who was in the army. I really liked it despite the fact that I was (and still am) a RAGING liberal and he was a fairly passive conservative. \n\nOne night on a phone call we starting arguing about same sex marriage and relationships. He kept saying, \u201cI just don\u2019t believe in it.\u201d A statement which baffles me when anyone says it, it\u2019s not the tooth fairy, same sex couples exist. But I digress. I got so angry I was crying because I just couldn\u2019t understand how he could be so dismissive and cruel. \n\nOur relationship didn\u2019t survive a year.

Ha. \n\nNow that I\u2019m in my early 30s and happily coupled with another raging liberal hippie whose political views completely align with mine I can say that teacher was far too gentle with me. So, I\u2019m going to say to you what I wish someone had said to me. \n\nRun. Cut bait. Get out of there. Political opinions on social issues are not something you can agree to disagree on because it\u2019s literally a disagreement on on how to treat other humans.
