I couldn't stay silent anymore and spoke up to defend myself and others in the group. Her uncle became angry and started arguing with me, but I didn't back down.\n\nAfterwards, my girlfriend told me that her family thought I was being confrontational and causing unnecessary drama. She asked me if I could just let it go next time, but I feel like I couldn't just sit there and listen to someone insult me and my community.\n\nSo, AITA for speaking up against my girlfriend's family, or should I have just let it go to avoid causing drama?\n\nedit: Appreciate all the replies and it will help me make a decision.

Otherwise I would say to get out of there before you get hate crimed.", "I be warning fellow minorities man. Leave her ass. NTA. She already showed you who she is.

Or maybe she is racist, but she can be open to learn about different perspectives and come to empathize with people who are different from her.\n\nOr maybe she is a raging covert MTG inside and you should run.", "NTA. \n\nThere may be a lot to like about this girl, but she pretty clearly has internalized the bigotry her family believes in and is clearly showing you that she will prioritize letting her family continue to be discriminatory instead of defending someone she is suppose to love and care for (meaning you). \n\nEveryone on this sub is going to scream break up with her and run. That is for sure the easiest thing you can do. But if you really do feel like you could see a relationship with your GF, you need to immediately have a very serious and potential painful conversation about expectations and beliefs going forward. Sometimes people just need to spend time with someone from a group they are intolerant of to realize the error of their ways. You could help your girlfriend and maybe even her extended family grow and become better people.

At first you're so in love you don't care, but as the decades go by you really start to understand what you're both missing out on. \n\nBe aware that they will likely never change. There won't be a moment of redemption, of clarity where they realize how wrong their beliefs are. Having kids won't open their hearts. You (and your gf) will always be on the edge of the family, the black sheep, the aberration. \n\nI don't regret being with my SO but it's not a path I advise other people to take.

And a total jerk. \n    Does your girlfriend agree with her family\u2019s views? If so\u2026 RUN!!!", "That is an excellent saying! One that I will definitely be repeating.", "While I understand this response, and agree with almost all of it... if my family were hateful racists, I'd have such a hard time picking them over my partner. I'd probably resent them for the rest of my life. It can be worth leaving family behind if they're not good people.", "Weird, OP didn\u2019t say anything about the uncle talking about lowering taxes, cutting government spending, or slashing regulations. If the way the uncle\u2019s \u201cconservative\u201d beliefs express themselves is through bigotry, then his beliefs are bigoted.", "Makes me think the comments werent really that offensive, just OP being overly sensitive", "I hear what you\u2019re saying but it\u2019s a lot easier to say that when you\u2019re young, in love, and righteously angry at the start. Look at it this way:\n\nYou only have to make the decision to break up with your SO once. Eventually you move on, meet other people. And while you are resentful for a while you do meet someone else that you love and the memory of your previous SO fades. \n\n\nBut if you break up with your family you have to keep deciding to do that all the time. Every time they invite you to something but tell you to leave your SO at home. Every major holiday, birthday party, wedding, even hospital visits and funerals are times you have to re-decide, refuse to be part of it, all for your SO. Even workplace small talk becomes a place where you have to lie to cover for the situation. Pretend you totally spent the holidays with family having fun. Pretend that they showed up to your wedding, or at least that they behaved themselves. Plus you might lose contact with minor siblings and niblings like my SO did. Years of no communication with innocent members of your family that you love and cherish\u2026\n\nAnd if they do cave and let you bring your SO be aware that doesn\u2019t mean they are now part of the family. Most likely your SO will be completely ignored.\n\nMy point is just that it never ends. Giving up your family will be a thing you deal with until all the bad ones die. Some people are worth it. But I don\u2019t lightly tell people to cut off their families for love because the cost is high.", "Except that you ARE worth it.  She isn't, but you are.", "Proud of you, OP. These would have been nightmare in-laws even if your relationship did work out (she isn't backing you up at all so you need to run, it would have never worked out, you gave her a chance)", "OP\u2019s girlfriend didn\u2019t get to pick her uncle, but she does get to pick who to spend time with\u2026 and the fact that she still spends time with someone who makes bigoted comments to the face of a member of a minority group is a sign that she clearly doesn\u2019t find his attitudes sufficiently objectionable. She may or may not be bigoted herself, but it\u2019s indisputable that bigotry isn\u2019t a dealbreaker for her.", "So she's supposed to cut off her own family? Easy to say if you're lucky enough to be born to a family that actually has good values. Not everyone is so lucky. Are the people who are unlucky enough to be born to families with bad values just...not supposed to have families?", "It\u2019s a hard question. \n\nI cut my mother and father out of my life because they were wolves. Just not good people. \n\nAnd I can say - if having family meant having those two people in my life - I would be better with none at all.\n\nIt took me decades to have the strength to let them go. And what I found after was that I did still have family. The members of my family by blood who were there for me and also the family that I built along the way. And I realized it is not blood that makes family - it is something far more important than that.\n\nOP is NTA.", "\"My GF's family insulted me and my ethnic group WHILE I WAS RIGHT THERE, and I called them out on it.  She said I caused unnecessary drama. AITA?\"\n\nI mean this in the most kind and gentle way: how would you answer a friend if they asked you that?\n\nNTA", "NTA - everybody needs to stand up to racism of all kinds.  Side note- if you eventually have children with this women, those same people will be spending time with your child.  Think about that before moving forward.", "NTA but dude your girlfriend supports that kind of hate and this may not be the relationship for you.", "NTA but don\u2019t waste your time with someone who not only doesn\u2019t have your back, but expects you to apologize and let people openly discriminate against you.", "INFO: what was the minority and what was the uncles comment?", "NTA. \n\n**Ever see the movie Get Out?**\n\nGive it a watch. \n\nOr rewatch if you have seen it. \n\nGF needs to learn she can't defend racism or she'll be your ex GF.", "I am highly suspicious of no matter how conservative a family is that they would just insult their daughter\u2019s boyfriend. I think this sounds fishy to me. YTA unless you can provide more info on what they said bcuz it sounds a little  suspicious especially since you didn\u2019t provide even a quasi example. Sounds like you don\u2019t like their political beliefs and were  just looking for an out.", "YTA - what are you expecting to happen? A wise man never argues with a fool, a bystander may have trouble telling the difference.", "Unless y'all are gonna get married, have no prenup and you'll surely get a hugeeeee million/billion dollar inheritance payout, I would leave. \nKudos to you if you can tolerate racism from in laws, but don't marry someone who willingly defends and argues on their behalf. \n\n(I'm broke and greedy af tho, so only take this advice with grain of salt.)", "NTA\n\nBut please don't date cowards who won't defend you to their racist family.", "What was the comment?", "NTA\n\nThis is not the GF you want.", "NTA- I don\u2019t want to be the bearer of bad news, but maybe this relationship is not meant to be.  Someone said something racist to you, you stood up for yourself, and she\u2019s mad at YOU?!??!???  What the hell???  I know most relationships have to do quite a bit of negotiating with how the in-laws will be handled but that is a huge red flag that she wants you to endure racist remarks so that you don\u2019t upset the racists\ud83d\ude2c You are absolutely allowed to set boundaries with her family!!!!!  They don\u2019t get to say every horrible thing that pops in their heads just because they\u2019re related to her.  She also needs to know where these boundaries are and she doesn\u2019t get to tell you that you have to endure horrible behavior just because it\u2019s easier for her.\n\nShe has no control over how her family acts, but she had plenty of chances to support you and she didn\u2019t.", "NTA.  why is it ok for her family to be confrontational with their comments but when you stand up for yourself, you're being accused of being the confrontational one.  \n\nHow does your gf feel about their opinions?  If she tolerates it, then that's a possible red flag", "Dude, hard truth time. Your GF can be with you and still be racist to your people and culture. It happens far more often than you think. \n\nThere is no version of your life where this woman is worth the turbulence ahead. In the best case, she goes NC with her entire family to be with you. In the worst case, literally anything that isn't that.", "NTA. OP please dump her immediately. She is never going to stand up for you against her family. You deserve a better relationship than the one you have with her.", "NTA. Run very quickly away from this entire family", "Run! Run far away!", "NTA. Your gf is though - she showed you no support or loyalty when all you did was defend yourself from a bigot", "It would be one thing (still bad) of the OP was the same race as the family. But he was the race that the family was mocking! If it were me I would IMMEDIATELY assume they were being racist to me! WTF?! That's not even subtle institutional racism, that is outright KKK shit.", "As a woman I have a good idea of what women are capable of. Still, I can't imagine anything that a woman could do that would be worth this.", "This. I do not understand couples with wildly different political views who just dont talk about it. Like...my political views are my morals. It's how I want to trest others and be treated. What on earth else could be stronger than that to hold a relationship together with someone who wants to treat others like shit? It baffles me.", "I upvoted your thoughtful comment but I have one respectful disagreement. If she\u2019s not racist but won\u2019t argue with her family: she\u2019s racist. \n\nIf she won\u2019t stand for it, she\u2019ll say so right there. And she won\u2019t tell you to just let it go.", "Wah wah wah, you gonna cry if I tell you my pronouns?", "Ed Zachary", "If you were born into a family with values you don\u2019t agree with, you speak up about it. I say this as a gay man who was born into a very homophobic family that has now embraced who I am and my partner as well. It wasn\u2019t easy and we had many loud arguments. However, silence is acceptance, and acceptance is support.", "I love the astounding ignorance of these groups /s\n\nSays something confrontational and objectively untrue; gets mad that you're offended and calls you confrontational. Fucking dumbasses.", "Get a new gf?", "NTA but you need to let her know that while she may be nice, her family is not and hope she has a wonderful life. Then delete her number.", "From [White Supremacy Culture](https://www.thc.texas.gov/public/upload/preserve/museums/files/White_Supremacy_Culture.pdf):\n\n> **Fear of Open Conflict**\n> \n> \u2022 people in power are scared of conflict and try to ignore it or run from it\n> \n> \u2022 when someone raises an issue that causes discomfort, the response is to\nblame the person for raising the issue rather than to look at the issue which is\nactually causing the problem\n> \n> \u2022 emphasis on being polite\n> \n> \u2022 equating the raising of difficult issues with being impolite, rude, or out of\nline", "> She asked me if I could just let it go next time\n\nHer uncle caused the disturbance, and she prefers to put the burden on her bf, the target of her uncle's bigoted statements, to keep the peace rather than her uncle by telling him not to make racist statements like that in her bf's presence. \n\nNever ask someone to set themselves to fire to keep others warm.\n\nNTA", "Silence is acquiescence", "It\u2019s always my family members with the most offensive/indefensible politics that argue this.

If you willingly associate with a bigot that makes you a bigot by association. OPs girlfriend decided that their humanity is worth less to her than her uncle's comfort.", "You're asking for a lot. Humans aren't meant to survive on their own, and familial bonds tend to be much stronger than other bonds. What happens if she cuts off her family and OP dumps her? She'll have nobody left.\n\nSeriously, the idea that someone who is unlucky enough to be born to a family of bigots is just supposed to cut off their entire family is unfair.", "So she has no friends either? No job? Is unable to make new friends or interact with people she doesn't share genetics with? She's not being regulated to a desert island, she's getting rid of horrible people in her life."]}
