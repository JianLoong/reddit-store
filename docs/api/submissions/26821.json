It messed them up, although perhaps not as much as your nephew.  My MIL took care of the kids until we took them when she died (kids were 12/15).\n\nTheir bio mom had at least 7 kids before aged 30 and I'm not sure if any after that.  The bio dad (hubby's half-bro) kept talking about how much he loved his kids, and MIL made my dad promise to bring the kids to visit him (which he did).  He's a liar and will say anything to benefit himself.  When their mom was dying, all he did was keep asking for her IRA (hubby got it and is giving to her 4 grandkids), he never cared about his mom, only about the money.  \n\nKeep your nephew away from your bro, assuming you have full custody, you are his father.  Your nephew doesn't need this loser in his life, I strongly feel that way.  Your bro will just try to get money from him, either now or in the future.

If he has been out of prison for a few years, but just now wants to be a part of the child's life then it sounds like you made the right choice.
