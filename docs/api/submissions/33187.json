He does not buy/make you gifts on their behalf, you shouldn\u2019t either. His family etc can sort that out.

If they want to get dad a gift, then it would be nice for you to help them, it would be awkward if they had to ask his girlfriend for help with this - or to ask Grandma... You are in a priviledged position as mom to take care of the young hearts of your precious little children - and they love their daddy.\n\nNow about the drum set - let your child know that either... No, dad bought it for you - it stays with dad...\n\nor\n\nThat either stays at dad's house or you will have to follow my rules on it...  Then you set rules for it that work for you.
