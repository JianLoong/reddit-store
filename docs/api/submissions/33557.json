Lol. What \u201cguidance\u201d can they provide you? \u201cI know better because I\u2019m 6 weeks ahead of you\u201d guidance??? Get the fuck outta here. \n\nThe entitlement is strong. You don\u2019t owe them an explanation. Don\u2019t give them one. Don\u2019t let people yell at you. They owe you an apology, and don\u2019t talk to them until they give you one. \n\nNTA", "NTA at all\n\nWhat guidance? That millions of women got pregnant before them, successfully had kids and didn't need your SIL advice? LOL\n\nY'all are in your 30s, I think you and your husband can manage this completely without them.\n\nStop reaching out. Stop being a doormat. Have some backbone and tell yourself you did nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\nJust because you were the first person that they told doesn't obligate you to tell them first.  You decided to announce the pregnancy a different way.  That wasn't a slam toward them just a choice that you made.\n\nYou can apologize that they were hurt but point out you did it so they could have more time to celebrate their good news.  That you didn't do it to hurt them.  \n\nAdults have to learn to accept that people may make different choices then they did and that there is nothing wrong with that.", "NTA.  You have your own life.  Your SIL and bro at complete non-entities when it comes to your pregnancy announcement. Tell them that this is a big life event for you and that your pregnancy is not about them and you don't appreciate them trying to make it otherwise.  \n\nMaybe distance yourself from them for a while. You don't need this shit right now.", "NTA - It sounds like you can't win with them. You were intentional on when to announce. The best they could muster was to whine why weren't they told first and you should be asking them for advice. What happened to \"Congratulations!...the kids will have a cousin their age to grow up with!.\"   \n\nThey present as a lot to handle. Release any burden you feel about being the ahole; you are not.", "NTA.  You do not need their permission to get or be pregnant.  They need to get over themselves.  Just let them throw whatever little tantrum they are having, and just take care of yourself and your-soon-to-be Little One.  They will (hopefully) stop with the nonsense soon enough.  You do not need to be stressing the small stuff right now.", "Since when do we need to ask permission and seek guidance to announce a pregnancy??? And", "NTA. You get to handle your pregnancy however you want, and you were deliberately trying not to steal their thunder. They could have approched you and said \"I'm a little hurt that we couldn't share all the first trimester experiences together\" that would be fair, but if they won't even take the time to hear your side of things, they are TA.", "Oh My! Nope NTA\n\nThere is NO expectation of reciprocity when announcing pregnancies. Theres no law or rule that says you have to let them know first because they let you know first. \n\nAdditionally, there is nothing in any rulebook that says you are required to 'ask for guidance on how to navigate' your pregnancy with ANYONE other than your partner and your Doctor (midwife or whichever birthing person you are using).\n\nI remember when my sister was expecting, her moods were really weird and she would get angry at the oddest things. So I would chalk the continued 'anger' up to pregnancy mood on their part, and give them space.\n\nAnd in the meantime, enjoy your own pregnancy and dont let their grumpy behavior bring you down!", "NTA. Your pregnancy, your body, your choice to tell whoever and whenever you want.", "NTA. Tell them they need to find a hobby. Ridiculous, don't not let their stupidly spoil you pregnancy. Congratulations now go and enjoy being pregnant and forget about any idiots in you life.", "Congratulations! They need to let it go, stop trying to communicate. They are being Overly dramatic.", "NTA. I feel like you and SIL had two different thoughts; you not wanting to take away from their own happiness and maybe your SIL would\u2019ve been excited that you are both pregnant at the same time. So, now she\u2019s feeling hurt.", "NTA but I do feel like if you had told them privately what you told us on Reddit, a lot of this could have be avoided. \n\nI had a friend who had a surprise pregnancy and was really not wanting to have another baby. She had a sister who struggled with infertility. She asked us what should she do and begin to explain her feelings. I told her \u201cprivately tell her what you just told us and let her take the lead\u201d.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Anyone yelling at someone for being pregnant can fuck all the way off, no matter what kind of bullshit they spew to try to justify it.", "NTA. I really don't understand why they would feel entitled to be told first. Maybe as a mutual thing? But there is so much going on in your lives with your SIL's pregnancy and the loss of your MIL, you can hardly be blamed for making your decision about the announcement in the way you did. Hopefully you already explained all of this to bro and SIL.", "NTA. You get to announce your pregnancy however and whenever you choose. You were trying to be respectful of your SIL\u2019s feelings around her own announcement and giving them time to celebrate their pregnancy. If anything, they should be thankful that you were so considerate of them. \n\nAlso I love how they think they\u2019re experts because they\u2019re a few weeks ahead of you in their pregnancy lol.", "NTA. Seems she wants to be the only pregnant person when people have kids all the time. So glad my family never reacts that way. One time we had 4 people pregnant at once! My uncle's wife, aunt, and two of our cousins. Awesome time!", "Lol they wanted you to tell them first because they wanted to talk you into \"taking care of it\" without anyone knowing so they could keep the spotlight", "NTA\n\nLOL they're 6 weeks ahead of you? I think they're just mad you did indeed \"steal their spotlight\". That's not your fault! But that's how they see it.", "They're just salty because you were the first person they told, and you told everyone all at once. NTA", "Seems to me any time you made the announcement would not have suited your SIL, BIL. Don\u2019t let them spoil your joy in your pregnancy and everything to do with it. Stand up to them then go low, low contact.\nNTA", "NTA. Stop reaching out. Maybe they\u2019re feeling superior about being pregnant first but there\u2019s nothing they could have told you that was earth shattering news or advice. It\u2019s not tit for tat. Everyone can share their news whenever they want.", "Guidance? What guidance? How long were they realistically expecting you to wait? Sounds like they expected you to ask for \u201cpermission\u201d to announce your pregnancy. If anything, you would think that SIL would be excited to have someone to share the experience with. NTA.", "NTA. \n\nOf all the ridiculous, petty things to be angry about, they're pissed that you told your immediate family first?! Wow.\n\nBTW, unless they've OB/GYNs, they can't provide you with any \"guidance\" you don't already have access to from your own Dr.", "NTA. Jesus, how magnanimous of them to want to guide you through this process that billions of people have been through over hundreds of thousands of years. Some people just can\u2019t help but trip all over themselves.", "Of course you are NTA. This isn\u2019t anger coming out of concern. It\u2019s anger because you aren\u2019t treating them as special as they think they deserve. You know this and are trying to justify their bad behavior. Stop doing that and tell them you have heard enough at least three times over.", "NTA, my wife and I didn\u2018t tell my parents, siblings and the rest of my family that we were expecting. It does help that we only see them maybe once every few months, due to us living in another state, a certain pandemic also helped with this.\n\nAnyway, it is your family and as such you decide what and how something is announced to people outside of said family.", "NTA - time to cut contact with SIL and bro.  They wanted ALL the attention on them.  And because you are also pregnant - they are very irrationally angry at you.  THIS is not normal behavior.  Time to cut the off until they start acting normal.\n\nAlso reaching out several times to apologize when someone abuses you - is just gross.  Please stop.", "NTA, and congratulations.\n\nThey're just upset that they're going to have to share the limelight now.  It's as simple as that.\n\nNot one word of excitement that cousins are going to be close in age?  That's pretty sad to me, and unfortunately says something about how Bro feels about you.  Is this a thing about this being his first time ever doing something before you had already been there and done that?  For cripes sake, his child is still going to be born first.", "Before the internet I might have understood the expectation of coming to them with questions... but the internet exists so I no longer seek out information from random family members unless it is something they do professionally or have studied in college. \n\nNTA", "If they were 6 weeks pregnant when they told OP and OP found out 2 days later, then really they are only 2 weeks apart in pregnancy! You find out you are pregnant at the 4 week mark... so yeah, what knowledge do they have being a whole two weeks ahead? Lol", "At best they could share tips or support each other because their pregnancies are so close to each other. But \"guidance\" ??? Don't they know each pregnancy is different one to another even for the same couple?", "More like 2 weeks ahead.  The kids could easily be born on the same day.", "I was being general and said 6 weeks because I didn\u2019t do the actual math. But yeah, 2 weeks is even funnier. I guess they\u2019re experts being two weeks ahead! Lol", "Exactly. But to pretend to know more because you\u2019re a sliver ahead? That\u2019s cocky and hilarious. Lol", "But...but...it's a whole *fortnight*!\n\nNTA\n\nSounds like a classic case of the older sibling wanting to make sure that because the babies will be close in age (and entirely possible that OP's child could even be born first...you never know!), they are really drilling it in that they provided the first pregnancy/grandchild preparation. Can't have the younger ones getting ahead now. \n\nBest of luck and congrats, OP.", "I mean OP could even be further along in pregnancy than them if it\u2019s not planned. I didn\u2019t find out I\u2019m pregnant until I was 7 weeks and couldn\u2019t keep anything down. Which technically means OP is the expert", "I don't wish ill on either baby hoping they come too soon or too late, but full term is 37 to 42 weeks. So **theoretically....** OP could end up having her baby 2 weeks before SIL and both would be healthy, and that would be hilarious.", "That would be awesome!", "Yep, absolutely possible.  My mother (whose periods were always irregular) thought I was a bad sinus infection until about the three-month mark, when the doctor told her she was pregnant."]}
