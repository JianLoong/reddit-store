Oh, of course.  We are so sorry it's taken us so long to get this ready to rent.  We should have realized that you wouldn't keep waiting.\"  And then the conversation should have shifted to how exciting it would be for you to buy your home now.  Their response should have been about your needs, and your joys. \n\n**Stop chasing them.**  If they are manipulative people, this is what they want.  They want to make you feel guilty for not continuing to wait and be strung along for another few years.  They want to make you apologize, not themselves for having a rude response to your good news, and now punishing you with silent treatment.  **They are doing silent treatment as a manipulation to make you feel guilty.  That's wrong.  So, stop calling.  Stop texting.  Stop messaging at all.**  When you stop, they will probably realize that you aren't running after them in a few weeks, or a few months, or a year, depending on their kind of manipulations, and will contact you again and pretend nothing happened at all.  Or they will get angry.  Whatever they do, it's not your fault that you didn't want to wait another three or six or sixteen years for them to do what they agreed to do and have been preventing from getting done.

I'd also **keep most of your plans off all social media**, so they can't find out your closing or moving day and sabotage it by demanding you all talk about this. There are manipulators who like to take your celebrations and find ways to ruin the day for you. If they have patterns like that, keeping your news close and silent until you are moved in, could save you drama and give you more joy.\n\nIf they are looking for control, I'd expect them to try something, like promises of super low rent if you just wait more.  This kind of thing, in subs that deal with abusers, is called \"future faking.\"  It's promises that never come true.", "NTA. Your parents are though. You've got to do what's best for your family. Some parents labor under the delusion that they own their children and their children's personal space and decisions. My mother threw an ugly fit when I moved from a rental apartment she'd made me take over from her, because rent had gone up on a short notice. It didn't affect her at all, but how dare I. Next time, she was selling her condo when we started shopping for one. Huge drama that we didn't want to buy hers so she could take it off the market and move on. You are not the problem here.", "NTA. It\u2019s taken them three years and you still haven\u2019t moved in yet.  Who knows how long it will be before they are ready.  They can always find someone else to rent.", "Nta- it doesn\u2019t sound like the house is ready for you anyway, so go ahead with your house purchase. Three years of waiting is being very patient for potential renters. Your parents needed to, as they say, \u201cshit or get off the pot\u201d with this renovation project if they wanted to guarantee you the space.", "NTA - if the house is good enough to rent to you then they will find other renters in no time.", "Nta. They didn't make it livable. You don't have to wait forever. They can sell the house or rent it out.", "NTA\n\nThey were never going to rent that house to you. And you certainly don't need the crap you would get from them if they were your landlords.\n\nYou made the right move buying your own home.", "NTA. Unless the original plan was a rent-to-own situation, sounds like they wanted your family to provide a source of income for them, with no regard for your future. It would be different if they already owned a home and then decided to rent it to you, but they went out of their way to buy a home, just so you can be stuck as a renter, instead of putting equity into your own home. Why not just sell you the home? Why is it such a big deal that you rent from them? They can sell it on the open market or rent it to another family.", "NTA. They already broke whatever original agreement you had by taking so long. And just to get clear, it's still not ready to live in?", "NTA. They can\u2019t seriously expect you to wait more than three years to move. That\u2019s on them.", "If these weren't your family you wouldn't blink twice at breaking the contract of \"Oh, when this house is renovated you will rent it from us\" given that they previously broke the \"<1 year\" timeline portion.  Even if they \\*had\\* fulfilled their part of the deal in a timely fashion and you'd been happily renting these last 2 years... renting isn't usually required to be a permanent thing.  NTA.  They can go find somebody else to rent this place, assuming they're ever finished.", "NTA.   \n\n\nIt's not your fault that it was time for you to move on from waiting for nearly 3 years for them to finish their renovations. They made a band investment, and it's not on you for doing what is needed for your family.", "NTA.   \nYou agreed to rent from them on a large, but set timeline. \"A few months to a year\" After three years of waiting you've decided to move on, that's perfectly reasonable behavior.   \n\n\nYou did not move on from the idea in the timeframe you agreed to (still things happen, but for the sake of argument) You did not convince them to buy you a home putting them in financial straights, and then back out the week of, leaving them scrambling to get the house covered.   \nThey bought a home. They renovated it. They asked you to move in as their tenants in \"a few months to a year\" to give them guaranteed rental income and likely better/easier relations than a regular renter would, they left you wait for 3 years with no end in sight. They did you wrong here.  \nThe time came and went, and you then waited for 2 more years. You're good.", "NTA. They can still be landlords, if they ever get it finished. And to be honest, these kinds of arrangements with family are often fraught with issues (especially if people are as touchy as your parents seem to be). You're much better off making fully independent decisions and arrangements.", "NTA - They can find other renters. Every dime spent on rent is a dime wasted since you get no equity from it.", "NTA. Your parents bought a house as an investment.  Just because you don't rent it doesn't mean that they can't rent to anyone else.  Buy your own house with your wife.  Your choices have nothing to do with your parents.", "NTA they said it would be ready in a year and 3 years later it\u2019s still not ready go buy your house", "I don\u2019t understand how you would be TA here. Your parents bought a hose and have been taking their sweet time renovating. Yea there was a lot of materials shortages around that time, but that should a few months delay not multi year. They probably can easily resell and recoup most of their investment.", "What's going on here? They bought a house for you to rent, and it's been taking three years to renovate? Why can't they rent to someone else, or sell it? They sound unreasonable, unreliable, and controlling. NTA.", "NTA. They told you it'd be ready soon and it wasn't. They can rent to someone else. Of course you're going to want to *buy* a house for your family. That's really common sense and they should have seen it coming. I don't know any family that wants to rent a place over buying one. They're missing out on their grandchildrens' lives and being childish. They'll probably regret all the things they've missed one day and it'll be their own fault.", "NTA. Your parents are seeing you as profit for their investment. If they want to be renters then they have to accept that their units will sit empty sometimes. That\u2019s part of being a landlord.", "Wow. Your parents = Manipulative much!!", "NAH.\n\nThey thought they were doing something for you and your family that would be beneficial to both of you and should have been a bonding experience.\n\nHowever, the timeline has made the offer unworkable for you. You are not an AH because the time has stretched so long that now it's time for you to buy your own home. They aren't AH's though for trying to make this work and do something nice. \n\nThe parents need to understand though that they simply took too long to fix the house up. They can still rent it out, or sell it. I don't blame them for being upset, but no one here is an AH.", "They sat on it for 3 freaking years, how long wa OP\u2019s comment family supposed to put their lives on hold?\n\nSituations and needs change, it\u2019s a shame the parents can\u2019t recognize that. Honestly, in today\u2019s market they should have ZERO problems renting out a renovated home - why are they dependent on OP renting?\n\nBeing able to buy a home is a miracle on its own these days, parents should be happy for them. Their reaction makes me think they wanted to also use it as some weird form of control over OP and their family.\n\nNTA. Hope parents drop the passive-aggressive tantrum soon.", "Yeah, and stop buying this one FOR THEM.", "It\u2019s a form of financial abuse to their child/grandchild.", "Except OP was being told that the work was almost done. Its tough to cut loose when you think its almost finished.", "But until recently, OP was in fact planning on waiting. OP only told their family they wouldn't wait once they have made the decision to stop waiting, its not like OP sat on this information for a year, OP told the family.", "Agreed.  The parents are acting shamefully.", "10/10", "Agree - That fact alone (the three years) would make me want to buy my own house.", "Your mother sounds like a nightmare. NTA, although you shouldn\u2019t have agreed to renting that house in the first place.", "Absolutely buy and do not apologize to your parents. They seem very unreasonable and may have some cognitive issues if after three years the house is not complete. I would not want to live in a home owned by them. You are an adult.", "Unfortunately, OP didn't include that in their post, so it's either an assumption or information that you've garnered from OP that they didn't share."]}
