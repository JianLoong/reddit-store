You have no obligation to do that.  Go buy your house.", "NTA and it sounds like you dodged a bullet here. Apparently your relationship with your parents depended upon you paying them rent. They would\u2019ve treated your family like tenants when it suited them\u2014but pull the \u201cfamily\u201d card when it came time to act like responsible landlords. \n\nIf you can afford to live in a house YOU own, then do that. If your parents want renters, they can get renters\u2026people who won\u2019t be afraid to demand their full rights as tenants, and expect your parents to act like real landlords. \n\nThe fact that they would remove themselves from their grandchildren\u2019s lives over this is truly sickening. They sound very manipulative.", "This one is super easy\u2014 absolutely NTA. Expecting someone to wait 3 years to move into a home is ridiculous.

That\u2019s insane. \n\nThey won\u2019t accept financial help to expedite the process and now they are salty because you\u2019re tired of waiting and have decided to own your own home?

If they want to stay angry, they should realize that they are really angry at themselves.", "NTA.  Buy your own home.

Obviously you\u2019d prefer to buy so why are your family being annoyed that you don\u2019t want to rent from them guess it\u2019s because they\u2019ve lost what would have been as easy rental income which is just selfish on their part. They can rent it to others or sell.", "If I\u2019m understanding correctly, your family has been renting a home.

Three years later you\u2019re ready to buy a house, I say go for it, you\u2019d be ready to buy whether or not you were renting from your parents. You\u2019ve got to do what\u2019s best for you and your family, and continuing to wait for a house that you may or may not one day inherit is silly when you can buy your own.", "NTA. That's ridiculous. If they are gonna act all hurt, they should have got the house ready for you years ago. Instead, they couldn't pull through with their side of the deal, so there's no reason you should put your life on hold to accommodate them. Especially when you have the opportunity to own a home instead of rent. \n\nYour parents can just find new renters WHEN they finally get the house ready. Simple and easy.", "NTA.  This is business.  In business each side brings something to the table.  They bring a working house, in a reasonable time.  You bring the money to pay for it.  You have held up your end.  They haven't held up theirs, and refuse to allow you and your inlaws to help them hold up their end. \n\nThey seem to want to play savior, and when through their own actions they can't do that, now they play victim.

They could  sell it, change something, let someone else live there... without your permission or even knowledge. And one day they might leave it to someone else too.  So you won't have any rights as a tenant (because \"family\") but also no rights as a family (because it is solely theirs).", "I'm confused.

They have taken three years to renovate the house and have refused the help of your partners family with this.\n\nYou now want to move out of the house? Or you don't want to wait anymore?\n\nEither way NTA. What sort of parent doesn't want their kid to own their own home.

No NTA.", "NTA\n\n>they bought the house then asked us if we wanted to rent.\n\nSo, it was their decision to buy that house, and having you and your family renting it came as an after thought. Correct? Regardless of time not having it ready, they shouldn't guilt tripping you over this.\n\nIf they are sulking - let them. You have your own family now to take care of. Not having your wife's side helping them is another (ugly) power play.", "Your parents had you on the hook with a house for 3 years and they didn\u2019t manage to complete the renovations?  how much longer were they planning to take?\n\nYou are NTA.  Buy a house with your spouse and build up your own capital with your chosen family. If your parents stop talking you over this, that\u2019s a problem for them, not you.  They took you for granted for 3 years while not doing what they said they would.", "NTA3 months to a year turns into three years and they\u2019re still not done.

And in the future don't make deals like this with your family.", "On the balance, NTA because they far exceeded the timetable you were given.  However, did you give them notice or offer to buy *that* house, in its present condition?  That would be the decent thing to do since there was a standing verbal agreement.  \n\nIf the house is at all livable and they\u2019re willing to charge a modest rent, they should have no trouble finding a tenant - rent everywhere is absurd.", "Wait .... what? You\u2019re renting a home from your parents & now you\u2019re planning to move. What\u2019s the issue with your parents?? They can just turn around & sell it to someone else.

They made a bad investment and got in over their heads, which is a shame, but they can\u2019t expect you to rent forever so that you can maybe someday help bail them out - especially not in this economy.  It honestly really sucks that you missed out on the low interest rates during the pandemic waiting around for this house.

That's why people ask questions here.", "We are still in our apartment that we had when they bought the house and we are in big need of something bigger since our family grew when my wife and I had our 2nd son and thats is our biggest reason for deciding to buy since it'll be faster at this point.", "I apologize... your parents may be lovely people (not ah) & just don\u2019t understand real estate.
