That's wrong.  So, stop calling.  Stop texting.  Stop messaging at all.**  When you stop, they will probably realize that you aren't running after them in a few weeks, or a few months, or a year, depending on their kind of manipulations, and will contact you again and pretend nothing happened at all.

My parents divorced when I was 4 and I moved in with him after I started going to college so by then it was already in bad shape. The front porch was unstable and falling apart, the carpets aside from my room were all the original from when he bought the place, the sunroof in the kitchen leaked when it rained (we had to put buckets under it), the front door was semi busted and would sometimes fly open when it got windy even when locked, stuff like that.\n\nI ended up getting a full time job and went part time on college so I could save up and afford my own apt all to not have to be stuck dealing with that place on my own.

The fact that they're three years in and are still remodeling it is a mistake. All their profits will be eaten up by carrying costs.\n\nY'all have done better in the real estate game despite having not done anything yet. Well done, you!", "NTA.  How does it take three years to renovate a house and it's still not done?  There's no reason for you and your wife and kids to continue to live in a construction zone.  Buy your own home.  They can finish the renovations and either sell it or rent it to someone else.", "also, it\u2019s taken them 3 YEARS!! Rather than one. OP shouldn\u2019t have to wait around forever for a home", "Lol who sells a portion of their property to their child\u2019s in-laws?", "Lock in that amortized 8% right in the face of a massive downturn. Such a great decision lol", "Happy Cake Day!", "They probably spent 3 years making it way better than they would for some asshole off the streets.", "Maybe it's time to put boundaries with your F-ing mom don't you think ??????", "Right? I\u2019m sure OP left out several years worth of conversations around planning and setting up the house to the specifications of their son and his family. Then he just bounces once he has a better offer.", "You record conversations with your parents?", "NTA\n\n3 years they have put off you being able to live there.  3 years!    \nOf course you should buy a home if you have the opportunity to do so!  If they have an issue with you buying a hime rather than them making money off you, after you\u2019ve been in limbo for 3 years, they have a serious issue.  \n\nWhy do I feel like something else is going on?", "3 yrs to wait for a rental is a long long time. Anyone would give up after months not years. NTA", "NTA. It isn't right of them to expect you to put your life on hold for an agreement in which they haven't been able to hold up their side of the bargain. \nAdditionally, nothing is stopping them from renting the property to someone else.", "NTA you definitely dodged a bullet you are definitely better off owning then renting especially from family", "NTA, they were expecting to have passive income from a house they bought, and renting it to you was less risky than having to go through maybe multiple tenants until they found responsible ones. Their reaction tells me they were using you to their benefit. Idk if there were talks about leaving the house to you in their wills, but with all these strings attached, I don't think it's worth it, especially when you can afford to buy your own house.\n\nETA: at first I thought you already live there, but wow, you waited 3 years for the house to be ready and now they're upset you're done waiting for them to finish renovating. That makes them even bigger AHs.", "Info: what do you mean they refused to let your wife\u2019s family help. Why has it taken three years?  Did they communicate the delay to you?", "NTA Three years of rent sounds like all they could have expected in this situation. Since they did not buy a house you could move into right away, that's on them. They could have had 3 years worth of rent by now. And then you guys could have saved during that time to buy a home. Why would you want to rent forever?", "NTA. They gave have you a timeline. They didn\u2019t stick to it. What did they expect?", "You\u2019ve been in limbo with this house for three years and they still want you to wait? Screw that! Buy your house. Good for you! Congratulations!", "There isn't stopping them from finishing the renovations and renting to someone else now. Someone you don't feel you have to give a below market rent.", "I'm glad someone was able to articulate what's going on here. The best I had was \"They're scamming you, op.\"", "Correction: they bought themselves a house and expected you to pay for it", "NTA. What a strange arrangement. Has the house been unoccupied for 3 years while you leased elsewhere? What on earth is wrong with it that it's taken three years to fix?\n\nA good rental property can be rented to anyone, there's absolutely no reason why you'd be the only person that could move in there unless they were planning on being terrible landlords and hoping you wouldn't complain because you are family.", "NTA you are being used and their passive aggressive unwillingness to address the issue like adults is beyond childish. Buy your own home and be free", "NTA, they shouldn't dictate where you live and you buying a home is more financially secure than just renting from your parents and paying off their rent. Nothing is stopping them from renting the house to countless other people who are in the market for a new place to rent.", "NTA.\n\nALSO RUN.\n\nYOUR FAMILY BOUGHT THIS HOME TO TRY AND CONTROL YOU AND YOUR WIFE'S BEHAVIOR. THEY WOULD HOLD IT OVER YOUR HEAD FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIVES EVERY TIME YOU TRIED TO DO SOMETHING THEY DIDN'T LIKE OR DIDN'T APPROVE OF, UNTIL THEY DIED. TRUST ME ON THIS, MY PARENTS WENT THROUGH THIS WITH MY DAD'S PARENTS. MY MUM AND DAD ARE FINALLY OUT FROM UNDER THE THUMB OF HIS PARENTS AFTER HAVING BEEN MARRIED FOR 50 FUCKING YEARS (WHEN MY GRANDPARENTS FINALLY CROAKED A FEW YEARS AGO). My parents owned the house, but not the land that it was on, so we couldn't sell it without the grandparents approval, and they would have gotten half the money, leaving us with not enough to even think about buying anywhere in this town without a massive mortgage that not even me and my father working together would have been able to pay off. It got so bad that we couldn't even cut down trees that were bothering us and damaging the foundation of the house because my grandparents didn't want them removed.", "NTA!!!\n\nIf they were genuinely expecting you to pay rent (or their mortgage, to be precise) I'd purchase my own, too!\n\nIf in a cruddy housing situation, maybe.\nI know here in Melbourne, Australia there are limited rentals and it's almost a fist fight on who can submit applications first, offering extra rent, etc.\n\nWe applied for over 80 houses and even offered extra rent... NADA!!!\n\nSo when the option came up to purchase instead, I took it\n\n(I did also rent a home from my Mother, and it caused the destruction of what little relationship we had.)\nShe upped rent by $50 at a time, refused to fix broken floorboards with water rot, or anything else for that matter.\n\nIt was when she kicked out a family friend from the rear unit to move 2 strangers in who stole our trailer..\n\nI'd had enough.\n\nWhen she towed my husband's $17,000 car for scrap (ie $300) we were done.\n\nSometimes, just sometimes.... it works out better with NO finances between family nor friends.", "Best reference. I love Jem", "It would be a waste to continue renting and not building equity in their own home. \n\nYou\u2019re suggesting OP throw money away just because the parents offered to profit off of their kid and then dragged their feet for three years?", "Do you not think it's fascinating though? Grabbing equity within the family is seen as terrible - 366 upvotes right now for someone saying it's terrible. But someone outside  the family is just fair game for equity grab? What the hell is that about?\n\nWith rents as they are, there are so many people spending half, two-thirds of their income on rent. Landlords call that \"passive income\" but nothing about it feels passive for those doing the work to earn it. So many people can't afford to buy their own homes because landlords take most of their money."]}
