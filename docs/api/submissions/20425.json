There\u2019s zero chance you\u2019ll get that money back. I always tell people who are planning a wedding but are dealing with family being dramatic to either not invite them or elope. Trust me, it\u2019s not worth the hassle.", "NTA\n\nI think the real issue is your future husband. He told his mother about your finances and seemed very on board with using it to help her. I don't see this as a MIL issue, but a husband issue. \n\nBefore you get married to this lad, you need to go over rules for finances and have him agree. You might want to make sure he doesn't have plans to move Mama and Bro into the house. Also, what does HIS credit look like, what is HIS debt? Have you checked, sat down with a financial planner, gone over everything?", "Your solution is perfect - they pay you first, the check/venmo clears, then you book the flights. No need to get angry, it detracts from the correctness of your position. The onus should be on mil and bil to explain why this doesn't work for them. And have a ready response for the inevitable refrain from deadbeats: DoN't YoU TRUST us? \"I don't need to trust you. Whenever you're ready, send me the money and I'll book the flights.\" Or, \"It's OK, don't worry about my points if it's inconvenient. Feel free to book your own flights.\" Again, if they have a problem with that, make them say it. As far as fiance claiming \"not to know\" how much it costs - well, that easy enough to find out, no?", "NTA, start to book the flight, screenshot the final amount and send it to MIL. Tell her as soon as she sends you the money you will finalize the reservations, and if you don\u2019t get the money by a set date you will assume she decided to purchase them herself. Do it via email or text so she can\u2019t turn around and blame you for not being at the wedding when she never actually buys tickets.", "NTA. Booking it in advance and waiting to get paid back is no different than lending money to family. DON'T!\n\nIf you're not ready to gift them the tickets. Don't buy the tickets, and hope to get paid back. Tell them you're built enough points on your own and are proud that you did it without help. \n\nThey will eventually find an excuse for not coming.", "NTA. It's HIS family, so he needs to deal with it. If you purchase the tickets, you'll never see a dime and there's no way it sounds like they would give you the money first. You can maybe suggest some kind of down payment, so at least you have some guarantee, and then put it towards a balance when you know how much it is exactly, but even that's being generous.", "I mean look the flights up and before you pay for it have them send you the money for the flight just have them on the phone while booking and don\u2019t book until you get the money. Also though if you\u2019re going to have a destination wedding and expect people who don\u2019t have the money to go to be there shouldn\u2019t you help pay for them?", "INFO: Has your fiance voiced that he wants/expects his mother and brother at the wedding?........ You know they don't have money ...... You chose a destination wedding..... How did you think they were going to be able to attend if you know they don't have money?", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t do it unless I had cash in hand. \n\nAnd sorry, but \u201cthey won\u2019t know how much\u201d? It take a few minutes to book flights to the point where the last step is click purchase. They could have their Venmo or cash app or bank transfer at the ready as soon as they hear that number. No excuse.", "NTA. You have 3 months to decide if you want to marry into this family. Don't let the 9 years push you into sunk cost fallacy.\n\nWhy is your fianc\u00e9 telling his family your financial details? Don't do this you will never see the money back. Time for your fianc\u00e9 to shut this down right now.\n\nRed flags are waving here.", "You are rhe only one who stands to benefit. If they are angry about it its because they intend to scam you. NTA.", "NTA. You are right, the fils are a bad credit risk. Was this whole idea brought on by them supposedly wanting to do you a favor? All you should have to do is say \"no thanks\". If your fianc\u00e9 does this, he should expect to pay you back himself.", "The risk with destination weddings is that not everyone will be able to go, either because they can\u2019t afford it, can\u2019t get the time off work or any other number of reasons. I don\u2019t think MIL or BIL have any intentions of paying you back if you use your points on them but do I think you have a choice to make:\n\n1 - use the points, have them at your wedding but accept you won\u2019t get paid back.\n2 - leave them at home.\n3- move the wedding home, or have another event for them to go to.\n\nI think your hope for them to pay themselves isn\u2019t very realistic so you and fianc\u00e9 need to have a talk.", "NTA.  You are smart to avoid this situation.  If you need to keep the peace, tell MIL that you'll be over your limit if you book for them.  And tell your fianc\u00e9 to stop disclosing your financial information to people.", "NTA. You\u2019ll have to discuss it again and let him know that while you\u2019re getting married, you are super uncomfortable carrying four figures of consumer debt for his family with no recourse to the cash. If he wants to pay for their tickets, let him pay you, THEN book the tickets and pay off your card. \n\nI know his mom probably thinks she\u2019s doing you a favour, but she sounds like the kind of emotionally immature person who isn\u2019t thinking about the actual matter - the money, and who\u2019s supplying it. Leave it in your fianc\u00e9\u2019s hands. It\u2019s his family.", "Esh.   \n\nThem, for not being honest with you.  Even if they are good intentions, you'll probably not get your money back quickly or at all.   \n\nYou:   for creating a $1000+ obligation for people.   Either shut up and pay for it or accept they won't be there.   This is a consequence of destination. weddings.", "Sort of YTA, but sort of \u201cnot your responsibility\u201d. \n\nAlso why are you getting irritated at your fianc\u00e9? \n\nI also second the sentiment of\u2026. why are you choosing a destination wedding if you KNOW some of the immediate family is struggling financially and you have no desire to help them afford it? Maybe this is very stressful for them, maybe they would need to pay it in installments. I cant imagine I would expect someone who is financially struggling to be in that situation and say \u201chey, wheres your $$$ hundreds to thousands up front?\u201d. This is your future family. For life. Not worth soiling the relationship. And sort of cruel to hang them out to dry with an expensive destination wedding.", "Yta, you're having a destination wedding knowing your future mil doesn't work.\n\nHow was she post to get there? \n\nOr she not post to see her son get married? \n\nThe brother should pay for his own, but her y'all should cover at least her flight and room.", "YTA. You and your fianc\u00e9 decided on a destination wedding knowing full well that your future MIL and BIL would not be able to pay for that.  \n\nFrankly, I\u2019m appalled that you both didn\u2019t even think this through.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Get to the point of purchase, give them the total and wait for that Venmo/Zelle/cash app or whatever to come through. The fact that they are acting like they couldn\u2019t possibly know or estimate the cost to send money ahead of time is really shady. Plus, why are they so determined to try to get you points? I bet you they aren\u2019t going to pay or will make a fuss in some way of they do.", "NTA. Upfront payment or you\u2019ll never see that money again, so be prepared. \nAlso, credit cards usually have a spending limit per month - considering a lot of wedding-related expenses that you could use your card for to get points, add flights might get you above that. So you might want to cap that (can also be used as a good excuse for not covering the flights ;-) )", "NTA", "NTA. If they don't find a solution, and she isn't able to book a flight in time and misses the wedding because of it, that's on her, not on your fianc\u00e9 or you.

Did you choose this location so they wouldn't be there?", "Loaning money to family is almost always a bad idea. If your guy wanted them there that badly, he should\u2019ve either planned to pay their way or not agreed to a destination wedding.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t do it, they won\u2019t pay you back.

But I do think that you expected to much from them, at the very least the MIL. I mean I get she can work but it's been 10 years so clearly she's not going to. And if she's living off money from the state there's probably really no chance to save any of that because usually it's just enough to try to get by. I get the BIL should have made better decision and tried to save but again you've been around long enough to know he can't manage money. All that to say you're not an asshole for not wanting to cover their costs. But YWBTA if you get mad at your fiance for covering them. He wants his mom and brother there and the only way to make that happen is for him to pay. In the back of his mind he probably knew that they wouldn't make it work but he didn't want to cause you stress and he was probably hoping for the best, which is why ultimately he said that he didn't know how much they would have when you asked for the money upfront.", "they are about to share finances most likely\u2026. so this is semantics.", "You\u2019re my hero", "I really appreciate your response. I have a hard time that she doesn\u2019t work but you are right she never will again. These are realities I need to accept. Thank you!", "There might also be a reason she doesn't work.   Mental illness.   Arthritis.  A hidden disability."]}
