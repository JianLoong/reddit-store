Respect is earned, and simply not dying doesn't qualify.", "ESH \n\nRemember you Gran was brought up in a time when mental health issues were shrugged off & people were told to suck it up & deal with it because it was something to be ashamed off (same thing with men showing emotion, married women working & unmarried Mothers)\n\nNow thank goodness times are changing but she still has that belief stuck in her head (probably reinforced by several examples where people did \u2018suck it up\u2019). \n\nHowever you could have phrased it better. Yes something needed saying but that was quite harsh; she can\u2019t help believing what she does even if it is wrong. Maybe it\u2019s time to sit down with her & some others to apologise for being so blunt but explain why your sister needs help & why you made the comment you did. Perhaps then she can start to understand", "Yeeeeaaahh.... Probably ESH.\n\nI agree with your point entirely, that old timey \"rub some dirt on it and walk it off\" attitude towards things like mental health is super toxic. That being said, pretty brutal thing to say. Could have handled it more diplomatically. Also, helps to remember that we're all products of our environment. When she was growing up, that was the normal attitude towards mental health. Ideally she'd be working to modernize her views a bit but it can take time.", "YTA. That was disrespectful as hell. How about you have a discussion with her, instead of insulting her like that? People can have different opinions, not everyone thinks like you. That doesn't make you better, even though you clearly think you are.\n\nBig YTA", "NTA. Your NAN is wrong in thinking that your sister can get well on her own without help. It also sounds as if she was being unsympathetic to your sister, which, I think, is what you're responding to.\n\nHowever, she is right in that having too many choices, which is what excessive freedom is, is not healthy.  There's research showing that too much choice results in stress, anxiety, dissatisfaction, and a raft of other problems. \n\nhttps://behavioralscientist.org/is-having-too-many-choices-versus-too-few-really-the-greater-problem-for-consumers/\n\nEDIT:  Google \"choice overload\" Here's another link:\n\nhttps://thedecisionlab.com/biases/choice-overload-bias", "YTA, you should learn how to have a conversation with someone who has a different opinion than you do that you don\u2019t have to walk away from because you can\u2019t handle it.", "And I\u2019m shocked to hear that grandma is apparently hurt by this.

What's wrong with having an actual conversation? \n\nAlso, your views will be outdated when you are old as well. Would you like your grandkids to help you learn new things, or do you think it's okay they insult you for not being up to date with whatever is important then?", "You are the first therapist I heard saying it's good to insult someone, instead of teach/having a conversation.

Come on now", "I mean, if grandma is saying brutal kind of crap, kind of deserves it back.", "Differing opinions is all grand and fine until it comes to genuinely bad ideas of how to handle mental health.

OP pointed out that grandma wasn't her sister's mother and left it at that.  An insult would have been \"Well, you'd be a bad mother to her\".  OP just told the truth and sometimes, the truth hurts.
