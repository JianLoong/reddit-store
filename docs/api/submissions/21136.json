She has to get rid of the water without pouring it down.\n\nMe and my dad thought of the same thing: siphoning the water into smaller containers so at least she would be able to pour the water elsewhere in smaller quantities. \n\nSo we told her to get a 10 liter plastic tank and a meter (3 feet) long hose tube and siphon the water into the smaller tank and pour it in the bathroom drain.\n\nShe asked us, How?\n\nSure, we somewhat expected such a response, but the next half an hour was excruciatingly painful for the both of us.\n\nWe started by explaining to her the concept of communicating vessels, a concept we all studied in middle school here in Italy. \n\n\u201cHow are those things even related?\u201d She asked.\n\nFine, we\u2019ll just explain the practical steps then. We are Chinese but I was born and raised here, but my dad\u2019s Italian is terrible so I had to take the \u201chonors\u201d. \n\nMe: \u201cStart by filling the tube with water and hold the two holes shut with your thumbs.\u201d\n\nLady: \u201cWhat? Filling the tube with water? How? What does that mean?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cKeep the two holes pointed to the sky and pour water in the holes.\u201d \n\nI was losing a bit of patience but working in retail made me a stone faced \ud83d\uddff statue.\n\nHer: \u201cBut how does this help me?? The tank! The tank is what matters!

How would the water come out like this? How can the water go up the curve and down again?\u201d\n \nI tried to demonstrate it without the water at first, just telling her to fill the hose with water and demonstrating it, then I got two cups and a V bent straw, filled one cup with water and left the other empty, then I dipped the straw inside the water and just hung the curve over the lips of the two cups.\n\nI also found countless short videos on YouTube to show her, one where a man siphons out water from a plastic pool with a hose.\n\nHer: \u201cYes that\u2019s cool but how does this help me? Am I supposed to leave this overnight? I can\u2019t do this every night?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cNo that\u2019s not the poin-\u201c\n\nHer: \u201cJust tell me how do I take the water out!\u201d\n\nThe debate was very long, me and my dad lost a couple of brain cells, every other customer that witnessed this went out laughing. I was about to go insane, I couldn\u2019t resist calling her an idiot, which is nothing after all that.\n\n\u201cHow dare you call me an idiot? It is not my problem if you can\u2019t explain because you\u2019re Chinese and can\u2019t speak Italian properly!\u201d\n\nI am a high school student with better grades in Italian language than most of my class.\n\nShe then stormed off and left everything.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nTL:DR: Customer is not smart enough to understand basic concepts, I got clinically insane trying to explain it to her and called her an idiot.\n\nEdit: I left out some insults she had directed towards my dad and me thinking they were better left out of it.\n\nShe called my dad a farmer because of his rough appearance, and because of our ethnicity.\n\nMost of you have no idea how it is like to work a retail business.

You work in retail, you're not obliged to explain something to anyone unless it directly relates to your job, but when you choose to, you can't expect everyone to be \"on the higher end of the intellectual spectrum\" (that last sentence alone makes it an EHS for me, because it makes you come across as pretentious and that you think you may be better than others)", "[deleted]", "NTA you can't help it if the gweilo can't understand, even with videos!", "NTA. She WAS being an idiot, and not a very nice one to say the least.", "NTA. I worked retail for 15 years. *I feel your pain.*", "NTA. Racist people can\u2019t understand *anything* in general, but certainly not anything from \u201cforeigners\u201d. She\u2019s just racist. It makes my heart sing that you called her an idiot. Some customers are worth losing.", "NTA\n\nI work in higher education and still have interactions like this with parents and students. You'd think writing where I do I wouldn't but .... I sure do. They're exhausting mentally and physically. And I don't know the physics of the siphon but I sure know how to make one and that it works. Dad used it to slowly water new trees we'd plant.", "NTA. Also thank you for explaining how a siphon works. I'm gonna show my kids.\nYes, I'm a grown man with kids and I just learned how a siphon works. American education system.", "NTA\n\nSorry you had to go through all that.", "Sometimes a youtube video on the topic does wonders.  Some people are visual learners.", "NTA\n\nOn top of being an idiot, this woman seems to be the type that demands stuff, and when people say no, keeps escalating until something breaks. The heck with her.", "I'm Chinese as well, among people who do this constantly. Berating, ingorance, slurs, you name it we have been harassed by it. You have to tune them out for your own good.\n\nNTA, just pretend not to know and move on. It got the point to where I just wanted people to leave as quickly as possible in our shop because the harassment was getting so bad. It isn't as much you dealing the lower ends of intelligence, it's more that people walk in and expect servants to cater to their every need. They demand a service while bitching at the people who provide the service.", "YTA\nThere's plenty videos on YouTube.\nShow them to the lady.\n\nIf she can't understand - tell her, sorry, you can't help.\n\nYou messed up your day and her's day by trying to help. And there were so many ways to avoid it.\n\nLady is also TA for offending you.\n\nIf this was me, I'd apologize for my behavior, if she's a good person she'll apologize too. Then show her YouTube :)", "That is a terrifying thing to imagine, I\u2019m not even sure where I would be placed on such a scale", "What do you not understand? I can clarify if you need!", "Don\u2019t think it would help much", "You can be dumb and polite at the same time. She was dumb and beligerant, also more than a little dismissive, and confident enough in her ignorance to be condescending when being offered solutions.", "Love your faith in people, but having worked retail, I absolutely believe in the prevalence of loud ignorance over the low cunning it would take to pull off this kind of manipulation. \n\nI once had a lady try to return a dead shrub she\u2019d only bought a few weeks prior, and when I noticed that it was *crispy* and asked what her watering schedule was, her response was \u201cNOBODY TOLD ME I HAD TO WATER IT!!\u201d \n\nTo this day, I pray that she is never responsible for any living thing with a central nervous system.", "Could be, maybe she was", "Yes I\u2019m a dick to people who treat me bad, I get furious when someone insults my family.\n\nUsually I try to treat anyone with due respect, as long as it\u2019s reciprocated.", "Bro you didn\u2019t have to so hard on her \ud83d\udc80", "Waking up every morning knowing that maybe today you could encounter some idiot dumber than the one you had yesterday is very discouraging", "You're 100% in the right here. It's not like you just called her an idiot, she tested your patience and insulted you and your dad. NTA, and don't worry. Some people refuse to learn.", "Even if you are the asshole. I think I\u2019d rather be an asshole than this dumb", "These 2.5 minutes are all you need to be convinced  https://youtu.be/9iUfCHzDUzY", ">evo sollecitare che lei era diplomata\n\nSollecitare? Do you really speak italian?", "The fact that you're even considering the issue is a good sign. :-)", "If it\u2019s just water that the ac has drained, with no chemicals, I wouldn\u2019t bother with removing it a bit at a time. Just wait until it rains, start a siphon, and drain it right off the balcony.", "Yes that is why she sucks", "He's terrible at Italian trying to explain it to her in Italian? And he's frustrated at her for the lack of understanding?", "Oh, here we go... XKCD has a comic for everything!  :-DDDDD", "I was literally just about to bring that up. There's always a relevant XKCD. Also, NTA.", "Which is also why it's far more understandable to lose patience with her than it is for her to be an arsehole from the jump.", "Go look at the auto mod copy of the original post. Op did not include that detail until after people started calling them out saying they should\u2019ve done that.", "Go look at the auto mod comment with the original post, op heavily edited AFTER this comment was made and added a ton of information. The person you\u2019re responding to couldn\u2019t read those things because op did not include them at first.", "The store beside my building is run by a Korean family, and there are very few days they are ever closed.\n\nI find most of the neighbourhood stores here ignore holidays, etc, regardless of the ethnic background of the owners.\n\nThere was a fish and chips place near me when I lived in Toronto, run by two Jewish brothers.   Good Friday was damn near their biggest day of the year, every year, because they were the only place open.", "Yeah I realized that later, my bad", "You are the AH for:\n\n1.  Giving an overly complex instruction to someone when it was unnecessary. \n\n2. Calling that person an idiot when they didn\u2019t understand you. \n\n3.

And do not buy into the whole \"customer is right\" toxicness that is spread like a plague across the US. So very VERY unlikely he would ever be fired in Italy for calling an idiot...an idiot.
