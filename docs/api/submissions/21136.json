She has to get rid of the water without pouring it down.\n\nMe and my dad thought of the same thing: siphoning the water into smaller containers so at least she would be able to pour the water elsewhere in smaller quantities. \n\nSo we told her to get a 10 liter plastic tank and a meter (3 feet) long hose tube and siphon the water into the smaller tank and pour it in the bathroom drain.\n\nShe asked us, How?\n\nSure, we somewhat expected such a response, but the next half an hour was excruciatingly painful for the both of us.\n\nWe started by explaining to her the concept of communicating vessels, a concept we all studied in middle school here in Italy. \n\n\u201cHow are those things even related?\u201d She asked.\n\nFine, we\u2019ll just explain the practical steps then.

How would the water come out like this? How can the water go up the curve and down again?\u201d\n \nI tried to demonstrate it without the water at first, just telling her to fill the hose with water and demonstrating it, then I got two cups and a V bent straw, filled one cup with water and left the other empty, then I dipped the straw inside the water and just hung the curve over the lips of the two cups.\n\nI also found countless short videos on YouTube to show her, one where a man siphons out water from a plastic pool with a hose.\n\nHer: \u201cYes that\u2019s cool but how does this help me? Am I supposed to leave this overnight? I can\u2019t do this every night?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cNo that\u2019s not the poin-\u201c\n\nHer: \u201cJust tell me how do I take the water out!\u201d\n\nThe debate was very long, me and my dad lost a couple of brain cells, every other customer that witnessed this went out laughing. I was about to go insane, I couldn\u2019t resist calling her an idiot, which is nothing after all that.\n\n\u201cHow dare you call me an idiot? It is not my problem if you can\u2019t explain because you\u2019re Chinese and can\u2019t speak Italian properly!\u201d\n\nI am a high school student with better grades in Italian language than most of my class.\n\nShe then stormed off and left everything.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nTL:DR: Customer is not smart enough to understand basic concepts, I got clinically insane trying to explain it to her and called her an idiot.\n\nEdit: I left out some insults she had directed towards my dad and me thinking they were better left out of it.\n\nShe called my dad a farmer because of his rough appearance, and because of our ethnicity.\n\nMost of you have no idea how it is like to work a retail business.
