Also this is a throwaway account since some people I know lurk here. \n\nI (38) is the youngest among 3 siblings. The oldest sibling, Ana (fake name, 45F) was the one who helped me when I was studying and trying to survive college. She allowed me to stay at her and her fianc\u00e9\u2019s place that time when I was studying and working at the same time. \n\nAna and her family moved to the province as they have business there. But her daughter (Stella, 20F) should stay in the city because it\u2019s near to her university.\n\nThey already sold their house and asked if Stella could stay at my place (I live alone, single, and just have 2 cats and 1 dog). Since I felt I had to give back to their generosity to me back in the day, I welcomed my niece to my place\u2026 which somehow became the worst decision I\u2019ve ever made.\n\nStella does not help with the chores at all. I would have to remind her time and time again to wash her own dishes after meal and do her own laundry. This is our agreement, I do not require her to wash both our dishes and laundry but at least do hers. She would always say that she\u2019s tired from long hard day, so I end up doing the task. \n\nNow, I had to travel out of the country for work. I had my animals left at a trusted friend\u2019s house because Stella wouldn\u2019t be able to look after them because she said she\u2019s busy and I am out for 1 week.\n\nI went home with trash in the living room and all the foods I have in the fridge are gone. She invited her friends and did a sleepover without telling me. The dishes looked like they\u2019d been in the sink for more than 3 days. I saw the tv remote control in the bathroom. It was a total mess and worst, they also went inside my closet room. I saw some of clothes on the floor. It looked like they played dress up\u2026 like fucking middle schoolers.\n\nI was so mad and called Stella (she was not in the house when I got home). She explained that her friends missed her and they were not allowed to hang out at the friends house. So they did it at my place. I told her she had one hour to come here and pick her things up because I\u2019m kicking her out. One hour had passed and she wasn\u2019t here. So I gathered all her things and left them outside.\n\nShe went home banging the door, it lasted for like 20 minutes. I didn\u2019t open it. Her mom called me afterwards and said \u201cis kicking my daughter out your act to repay our kindness for you when you needed help?\u201d I hung up because I didn\u2019t want to throw bad words out of anger.\n\nOur relatives were split. Some said they will be mad too if they were to come home with that mess but some said I will be making it hard for my niece to do well in her studies because now she\u2019s currently at her friend\u2019s house but until the weekends only. She is looking for a place and will have to do a part time job to afford it.. which will tremendously affect her focus on education. AITA?\n\nETA: yes, I took photos of the mess and eventually sent the photos to her parents. The call with my sister happened first so she was mad shouting at me and calling me ungrateful. I was literally still shaking that\u2019s why I decided it was not a good time to talk and hung up on her. I then sent the photos to them and only my BIL apologized. \n\nI have brought up the issue with my niece not cleaning after herself to them before and BIL said they will have a talk with niece but nothing happened. I understand that kicking her out in a short period of time and giving only one hour may sound ridiculous, but I was so mad and tired from my travel.", "created_utc": 1700334922, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ydnn1/aita_for_kicking_out_my_niece_from_my_apartment/", "score": 122, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That was so rude and ungrateful, I can't imagine as an adult trashing someone's home like that. She has no manners and you shouldn't tolerate that, its ridiculous. I'm sorry you had to go through that.", "NTA. In English, we call that \"Biting the had that feeds you.\"\n\nTo her mother:\n\n\"You'd be welcome to stay with me any time. Your daughter started out welcome. Then she completely refused to clean up after herself. When I was away, she had her friends over and they trashed my place, including going into my private areas and leaving my things thrown all over. They never even tried to clean up any of the mess they made. I've had all I can take of her.\"", "NTA. Did you send your sister pictures of the mess and ask her if this would be acceptable in her house? If you were indeed a respectful tenant when you stayed with her, you can also point out the differences.", "NTA. She should know better at 20.\nI am curious though, were there any prior warnings or instances to give her a reality check before you threw her out. Like did she know that could ever be an option.\nI don't think you were in the wrong at all. 20 is old enough to know better. Their brain still isn't fully developed at 20, and sometimes if you don't point out the obvious they don't consider it a possibility so just wondering if it was even on he radar that there could be consequences this bad or not.\nEither way she's not your problem and you did repay their kindness. If they throw that in your face again just remind them that when they were showing you kindness, you didn't act the way your niece was acting (assuming). So that argument is invalid.", "NTA. It was so disrespectful to not even ask you about bringing people to your home, and messing your things up just crossed the line. I didn't pay attention to her age at first and thought she was a teen with the whole not doing ger chores thing, but she's 20! She is really irresponsible. I can't believe a 20 year old was so childish and disrespectful when being in somebody else's house who kindly welcomed her. Her parents are also wrong in just ignoring all she did and standing against you. How they didn't wanna punish her for such disrespectful behavior only shows how spoiled she is.", "NTA she is disrespectful and ungrateful. Don't take her back.", "NTA.  Shitty houseguests get the boot, no matter how nice their parents may have been to you in the past.", "NTA,\n\nthe world doesn't revolve around your niece. her well being and comfort is not top priority in everyone's lives.", "NTA.  You repaid your sister's kindness by giving your niece a place to stay. That does not mean you had to give her a permanent place. And your niece completely threw your kindness on the floor and stomped on it. \nYou were right to toss her out. If this makes her studies harder, well, gee, such a shame. She probably wasn't studying anyway. She can make a mess at her friend's place. It won't be long before she's tossed out of there too.", "Nta, her friends can take this slob in.", "NTA\n\nBut maybe it would have been better to inform your sister Ana beforehand, including some pics of the mayhem her daughter and her friends had left behind. Maybe she would have understood your decision, and your relationship wouldn't be in jeopardy right now.\n\nIt will be hard to mend your relationship now, more so after you have hung up on her during that dispute.", "NTA. She knew the rules, she had not been following the agreed upon rules and then violated all the rules. She kicked herself out by her actions. They are just mad that they have to find another place for her.  If you acted that way, they would have done the same thing to you.", "NTA. You were a respectful houseguest to your sister. Her daughter is not.", "NTA.\n\nYour niece FAFO'd.", "Nta wouldn\u2019t think twice about it.", "Don\u2019t let her moved in with you anymore you did the right things", "NTA\n\n\nShe was warned. She is also an adult who is responsible and needs to take accountability for her choices and actions on someone else's  house. \n\nShe doesn't have mommy and daddy cleaning up after her. You are doing her a favor, and she spat in your face that generosity and hospitality. \n\nI can understand eating all the food in the house but allowing your friends to play dress up in someone else's closet without them knowing and then having to come back home to a ransacked home.\n\nIt is completely disrespectful. \n\nYour niece is 20yo, way passed time to grow the fuck up.", "NTA, she's an adult so no excuse for leaving such a mess at your place. Hopefully she'll think twice before doing the same again when she moves to her next abode.", "NTA- you\u2019re right to be angry but maybe we\u2019re too abrupt about kicking her out. Clearly she needs to grow up and take basic responsibility for herself in a shared living space, for the damage her friends caused, and allowing her friends to invade her private space. Clearly, an apology from her was just to excuse her behavior and downplay her being irresponsible. I might have pointed these out and then said it wasn\u2019t working. I would have given her time to move out and find something else. It\u2019s not in the post, but I would have yelled at her parents about how she was treating you and have them pressure her to behave better.", "ESH. I would say 1 hour is not enough time. I get you were furious, I would be too, but there was better way to deal with it. Like idk filming the state of the house and sending it to aunt's and giving her time till evening/morning, depending on time. \n\nHave you been telling your aunt how bad it is from the start? Because if not, in her position everything seemed to be ok ok ok and them BAM you're kicking her kid to the street out of the blue. I get her feeling too", "NTA but let her move back in while firmly telling her that you're kicking her out for good if it happens again in any way e.g., 3 days of dirty dishes.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yes they did you a kindness, and I'm 100% sure you did not repay them with the behaviors that your niece exhibited. If you had done so, it's likely that you would not have been allowed to stay.\n\nShe's been disrespecting your home and your simple requests since she first moved in, and massively while you were gone.

Sis and BIL were rude in not following through on your messages about the mess.

The bill is paid in full!!\n\nNTA", "Niece is a ungrateful messy woman. When your sissy calls you ungrateful, you can tell her that you we\u2019re grateful for the opportunity to live with them.

I would have also kicked her out immediately as this is really really unacceptable.", "I remember one New Year's Eve, spent at \"friend of friends\" - it was a typical \"parents are away, so let's make a party\" situation.   \nWe didn't even \"trashed\" the place, but a bunch of older teens and early 20s in a 3 bedrooms apartment always makes some mess (dishes, glasses, crumbles on the carpet, some leftover food - the kind of things) - normal stuff, like any average party.   \nAnd... unexpected - parents were back earlier, than we thought. They called the son, early in the next morning, that they're on their way and be home in a 20 minutes.   \nDuring those 20 minutes we cleaned the apartment shiny, managed to wake up and make almost sober some friends, who have had \"one beer too much\" and expedict them out of there (so parents of that boy didn't see them in this state).   \n\n\nWe didn't left all, because we didn't want to leave him alone to deal with his parents, because some neighbours complained about the noise (hey, it was NYE, of course it was some noise and loud music and stuff).   \n\n\nHis parents were angry at the beginning, but after we sit and talked a little and they saw, that nothing wrong happened, there is clean and tidy everywhere and we're just \"nice kids\" \ud83d\ude1c , he was only very mildly grounded because of this party  \ud83d\ude07.", "I took pictures of all the mess from living room, kitchen, bathroom, and closet.

I had my niece, so my children\u2019s cousin (ex\u2019s sister\u2019s child):stay with us for a University placement, and she did this too. When she wanted to do a 2nd placement, I refused and showed (very house proud) grandma the photos, which I had sent former SIL before. Grandma understood and read granddaughter the riot act and found someone from her church to put her up. My own kids aren\u2019t particularly tidy, but they do wash up and get their clothes in & out of the washing machine.", "None of this is on you. I feel like this is a reflection on her parents if none of them think she deserves being kicked out for how she's treated your generosity.
