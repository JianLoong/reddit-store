We've called our son \"Little Cockblock\" (not to him directly) tons of times. We have also called him \"Mr. No Siblings\", because any time we are trying to do something, suddenly there he is, even at almost 6 years old, not minding his own business. \n\nYou can get frustrated, cry, or scream, or take it in stride, which is what we do. There have been times we are on vacation and my husband gives me a look, and I'll say \"Don't even think about that with CB McGee over here!\" and we laugh.\n\nIf your husband said it in a mean way, or said it to your son, that's not ok.

It's not a description I'd use - apart from anything else, it plays to the idea that men want sex, and women sometimes provide sex, rather than understanding that both men and women can want sex - but it reads like a rather light-hearted way to point out that he'd like to have sex, but they obviously can't when the boy's in the bed with them.\n\nFor me, husband becomes the AH because he said that in the boy's hearing. Small children are sponges, and you just know that the boy is going to call someone a cockblock next week.\n\nINFO:\n\nIs OP generally interested in sex with her husband? People would generally expect to have more sex on vacation than they have in a normal week. Is OP satisfied with the amount of sex she's currently having?

Sex is now not an option because I don't want to have sex with you when you're being a dick.\"", "Like she is obviously caring about how he feels? She lobbed the first grenade when she invited her sister to sleep in their suite when he clearly (and crassly) stated what he was hoping for.. only he needs to listen to vocal ques?", "Fair point on the perception, yes they absolutely should talk more about this", "Really? Her not agreeing to sex is a punishment...?\n\nOr maybe he was a dick and she wasn't in the mood, and she ensured he wouldn't pester her about it every waking moment because he unilaterally spent *their* money on an extra room, expecting he would get sex without actually talking to his wife...?\n\nThe problem for her was his *disrespect*. She took the first instance as a joke. She didn't immediately shut him down permanently. She told him not to call their son a cockblock. A very basic request. He then doubled down and did it again, ignoring a very basic request. That is disrespectful. He is allowed to express his desire and he got to. He's not allowed by default to ignore her requests without consequences.\n\nShe didn't give away the room until he doubled down on his shitty joke after she informed him she didn't like it and to stop.", "Yeah, she should communicate with him, because he has an attitude problem.", "He is being a baby...because she didn't give him what he wanted.", "She doesn't have to fuck him if she doesn't want to. If he wants more, he should discuss it with her, instead of making shitty \"jokes\" about their kid.", "Lol no communicating with words is the clearest communication", "I think it became an issue when the wife decided her sisters comfort was more important than the needs of her relationship when specifically called out.. as a couple they probably need some counseling..", "Sex is a 2 person consent situation. He wants to have sex during this family vacation and she does not. She has said elsewhere that the kid doesn\u2019t sleep with them at home and their sex life is regular and satisfying. \n\nThis is not a situation where she is withholding sex for a long time and he\u2019s just desperate for connection\u2014he is pissed that she is allowing their young son to sleep with them during vacation, which is very common when there\u2019s a change in a toddler\u2019s routine, and rather than have a rational discussion where they come to a mutual agreement (we\u2019ll have sex when the kid is with grandma, we can have a quickie in the bathroom, we can use the other room when sister takes the baby, etc), he decided to be crass, double down when she asked him to stop, and cheated himself out of any negotiation because she is no longer interested.", "That does tend to happen when people are ignored and taken for granted. This guy is very clearly not the one with the communication problem.", "If she doesn't want to have sex with him she should communicate that instead of ruining his plans and gaslighting him .", "Because no sex is the worst thing in the world. Poor guy.\n\n/s", "Gaslighting, really?", "Man I dont know what man hurt you, but one day I hope you get out of this funk your in and find love. I'm sorry someone hurt you.", "Yea, she could have just said she didn't want to have sex, instead of pretending a joke ruined the trip.", "Thank you for your condescending BS.", "He should have asked, instead of expecting it."]}
