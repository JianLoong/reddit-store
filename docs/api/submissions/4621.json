And my stepdaughter, 14.  I married my husband a year ago but we had been together for two years before that.  \n\nAll of my kids are great.  My son will be joining the armed forces when he has completed high school. And my two daughters are planning on college.  \n\nNow here's the problem.  I am a Mexican American.  I am a citizen as I was born here as were my parents.  My first husband was Mexican. From Oaxaca. So both my biokids are very clearly Mexican American.  Not physically. Just in the way that they were raised.  \n\nThey are also fluent in Spanish and love their roots.  One thing that my daughter has always wanted is a quince. \n\nFor those of you who don't know, a quinceanera is like a sweet 16 party.  Except it takes place on your  15th birthday.  All of her older cousins have had one and it is her dream. \n\nSo we have started shopping for dresses for her and her court.  She will have a group of girl friends that dress up with her. And a group of boys that escort them. We are also getting her fancy high heels for dancing. It is a whole thing. \n\nMy stepdaughter is good friends with my daughter so she will be part of the court.  Fancy dress the whole deal.  She is very excited to participate.  \n\nMy family and her dad's family are all pitching in to have a great party.  It is going to be beautiful and I am very proud of my daughter and want her to show off her heritage.  \n\nMy stepdaughter's mom has heard from her about this party.  And she thinks it's not fair that my daughter gets this and hers doesn't.  \n\nOne slight problem.  My husband and his ex wife are from Minnesota. And they aren't in any way Latin American.  \n\nMy stepdaughter is a beautiful young woman who has family on both sides that still live in Sweden and Denmark. \n\nMy stepdaughter has told her mom that she is being ridiculous.  My husband has told his ex that his daughter has no cultural connection to a quinceanera. \n\nBut she refuses to listen. All she can see is that her daughter is losing out.  \n\nShe is threatening to go to court for equal treatment of the girls. \n\nI am at a loss.  She is calling me an asshole for favoring my daughter over my stepdaughter.  \n\nI don't think I am.  We will be having a sweet 16 for her next year.  But that's apparently not good enough.  \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670940743, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zkwpno/aita_for_having_a_quinceanera_for_my_daughter_but/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A Fancy Fifteen? \n\nThen they could both have sweet sixteens when they are 16.", "NTA Let her go to court and waste her money on a fruitless endeavor. Your stepdaughter fully understands. Maybe she'll have a bigger 16th birthday party than your daughter. Equal treatment doesn't always mean the exact same thing.", "Wait. ~~What does your step-daughter think?~~ Her mother is being ridiculous, BTW. Her daughter can have a traditional American sweet 16 party.\n\n~~Ask your SD what she wants. She's the only one that matters in this and y'all can compromise if needed.~~\n\nNTA\n\nEdit - I misread, your step-daughter doesn't even want one, so her mother can go kick rocks.", "NTA. Your step daughter's mom can throw her a party. Plus she is getting a culturally appropriate party of her own the following year.  Bio mom needs to check her entitlement.", "NTA.  For very valid and relevant cultural reasons one girl is having a Quince and the other a Sweet 16.  Doesn't sound like anyone is being treated as less, just one girl happens to get their moment a year before the other (which could be more fun anyway).\n\nThe ex can pound sand, especially since she seems to be the only one upset.  She sounds like a super awesome human who will hopefully have her rear end handed to her by a judge, assuming she's not bluffing.", "NTA. The ex is being crazy and I doubt she\u2019ll go to court over it. Your compromise to give a sweet 16 is more than fair. Having a culturally themed party for someone with no cultural ties makes zero sense.", "I think your sweet 16 solution for the step daughter is appropriate. You\u2019re NTA. Good luck dealing with step daughter\u2019s mom.", "Definitely NTA and even your stepdaughter sees how ridiculous her mom is being! The sweet 16 party was going to be my suggestion but I see that\u2019s already the plan. Fantastic! Bio is jealous because she thinks he daughter is missing out on something that she really doesn\u2019t have an cultural connection to. Let the mom have her little tantrum and ignore it. Let her waste everyone\u2019s time, including the courts, on taking this issue of hers in that direction! She\u2019s only making herself look even more foolish! If she actually does take this to a judge, pretty please update! LOL. You and your husband are doing absolutely nothing wrong or unfair here and even your stepdaughter sees that!", "NTA.  I just spit coffee all over my dog. If I have this right your husband's ex wife wants you to through a quinceanera for your stepdaughter who has no Latin roots whatsoever.  That's hilarious.  And your stepdaughter gets a sweet sixteen party next year.  That seems equitable.  I would be interested to know what a family judge says about that.", "NTA literally just tell the mom to throw her daughter one if she wants to. Fair treatment, each daughter gets thrown a quinceanera by their mom. Perfect.\n\nEdit: I am fully aware how ridiculous it would be, but it's what she wants so fuck it let her make a fool of herself.", "NTA, and it sounds like your step-daughter approves. Her mom sounds miserable. Doesn\u2019t she understand how culturally inappropriate her suggestion is?", "NTA - what if your biodaughters were Jewish and had Bat Mitzvahs butr stepdaughter was Christian, would her mom still expect you to throw a bat mitzvah party?!", "NTA - I was going to suggest that you throw a big party for your stepdaughter for her Sweet 16 but you've already going to be doing that. Your step-daughter's mother is being ridiculous. I'm glad to see that at least your step-daughter is actually being logical about this situation and knows that her mother is being ridiculous. Maybe try to explain to the mother that while yes your daughter is getting a big party this year, that your step-daughter will be having the big party next year and your daughter want (IE everything is pretty even and fair). I don't think that will help much but it's worth a try.", "NTA. She's being ridiculous. Your daughter will get a quincea\u00f1era and not a sweet 16 party.

It\u2019s a cultural celebration and like you said, she will have her chance to shine when she has a sweet 16 instead. If the ex wants her to have a party that badly, she can throw her one herself!", "NTA- your husband got it right. Stepdaughter has no cultural relation to a quince. The appropriate equivalent, as you suggested, is a sweet 16. My suggestion is to inform step-daughter and her bratty mother that you will invest the same time and effort into her sweet 16 the following year. And then both girls will get to participate in different cultural traditions.", "NTA. I like that you're celebrating your family's heritage. As long as step-daughter gets a big fancy Sweet 16 parallel to your daughter's quincea\u00f1era your celebrating both the young ladies culture and family and being very equitable.", "NAH - Her parents owe her a sweet 16, and have to try to outdo her sister's.", "NTA - She is being absurd. Her daughter doesn't even WANT a quince. \n\nTell her that her daughter will be getting a sweet 16 next year and that she should start saving now, because she will need to pay half.", "NTA. Your stepdaughter doesn't really want the quince, by the sounds of it. It's just the ex-wife making a big fuss over nothing so she doesn't get forgotten about.", "NTA. A quinceanera is not part of your step-daughter's culture so it would not be appropriate for her to have one. Especially since she seems fine with this. Maybe when it's her 16th birthday, you could plan another special celebration for her.", "NTA.  Wow, I mean...It doesn't sound like it is bothering your step daughter, at all, so I'm not sure why it's bothering her mother.  My suggestion would have been to throw her a sweet 16 next year, but after getting to the end of your post, it seems you already have that covered.  So yea, not understanding the issue in any way.", "NTA - I mean the stepdaughter could just have a sweet 16 instead. It's literally the same thing okay not literally but you understand what I mean.

It is a cultural thing and your step daughter is not part of that culture. And it wouldn\u2019t be your responsibility. Anyways, if her mother wants her to have a party so bad, she can throw it herself. It is not on you to spend any of your own money on it in the first place! She\u2019s not your kid.

To be honest, I would be bringing up how racist her behavior is.", "NTA\n\nSo, if I'm reading this correctly, even your stepdaughter is OK with not having a Quincea\u00f1era, just HER mother is complaining?\n\nI would say that if ot was part of her heritage, then yes she deserves one also, but it isn't.

You can try with this analogy: This would be similar to a Jewish woman throwing her son a Bar Mitzvah and the ex complaining that her same-aged Christian son (the Jewish woman's new stepson) isn't getting one.\n\nIt's ridiculous. If she actually tried to take this to court, the case would be thrown out immediately on grounds of stupidity.", "NTA. she will have a sweet 16. I am glad your step daughter does not feel left out and understands. And the court comment is a joke. No court will make you guys throw a party.  That is laughable.", "NTA.

I assume step daughter will also be getting a new dress to attend as part of the court, which would also show that there is no favouritism here.\n\nStepdaughter's mom is being ignorant.
