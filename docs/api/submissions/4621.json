My son will be joining the armed forces when he has completed high school. And my two daughters are planning on college.  \n\nNow here's the problem.  I am a Mexican American.  I am a citizen as I was born here as were my parents.  My first husband was Mexican. From Oaxaca. So both my biokids are very clearly Mexican American.  Not physically. Just in the way that they were raised.  \n\nThey are also fluent in Spanish and love their roots.  One thing that my daughter has always wanted is a quince. \n\nFor those of you who don't know, a quinceanera is like a sweet 16 party.  Except it takes place on your  15th birthday.  All of her older cousins have had one and it is her dream. \n\nSo we have started shopping for dresses for her and her court.  She will have a group of girl friends that dress up with her. And a group of boys that escort them. We are also getting her fancy high heels for dancing. It is a whole thing. \n\nMy stepdaughter is good friends with my daughter so she will be part of the court.  Fancy dress the whole deal.  She is very excited to participate.  \n\nMy family and her dad's family are all pitching in to have a great party.  It is going to be beautiful and I am very proud of my daughter and want her to show off her heritage.  \n\nMy stepdaughter's mom has heard from her about this party.  And she thinks it's not fair that my daughter gets this and hers doesn't.  \n\nOne slight problem.  My husband and his ex wife are from Minnesota. And they aren't in any way Latin American.  \n\nMy stepdaughter is a beautiful young woman who has family on both sides that still live in Sweden and Denmark. \n\nMy stepdaughter has told her mom that she is being ridiculous.  My husband has told his ex that his daughter has no cultural connection to a quinceanera. \n\nBut she refuses to listen. All she can see is that her daughter is losing out.  \n\nShe is threatening to go to court for equal treatment of the girls. \n\nI am at a loss.  She is calling me an asshole for favoring my daughter over my stepdaughter.  \n\nI don't think I am.  We will be having a sweet 16 for her next year.
