She went to culinary school and is by far the best cook in the family, so she usually cooks Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner, though I also cook and host sometimes. This year, she wants to host and cook all vegan food for Christmas dinner. I will and do eat vegan food with her, but this year has been really hard for me (for unrelated reasons) and I would prefer to eat things with butter and cheese on Christmas.\n\nI asked her if she would be willing to cook vegetarian food, but she said no. I asked if we could eat out instead, so that she could get something vegan and I could eat non-vegan, and she said she didn't want to do that. I responded that I would skip Christmas dinner, in that case. She and other members of my family are quite upset at me.\n\nI feel I've tried to compromise and she hasn't. I feel I may be TA, though, because she wasn't opposed to me cooking my own food and bringing it over, but I would have rather eaten out than made an entire separate meal and transport it. So, WIBTA?\n\nEDIT: To be clear, the meal would be for me, my sister and my mom. It's not a huge meal.", "created_utc": 1703287143, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18orrfi/wibta_for_not_attending_vegan_christmas_dinner/", "score": 238, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Vegan food cooked by a trained chef is far better than random take out. Your compromises were unreasonable. Why couldn't you just make your own mac and cheese or whatever and bring it with you? She literally said that was okay and you refused! That's ridiculous. If she wouldn't let you bring your own cooked dish to the family dinner then she would have been the A.

Her very adorable daughter (maybe 3??) got to hang out with her various cousins, aunts, uncles, great aunts and uncles and grandparents. She made no complaints.

She went to culinary school and is by far the best cook in the family, so she usually cooks Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner, though I also cook and host sometimes. This year, she wants to host and cook all vegan food for Christmas dinner. I will and do eat vegan food with her, but this year has been really hard for me (for unrelated reasons) and I would prefer to eat things with butter and cheese on Christmas. \n\nI asked her if she would be willing to cook vegetarian food, but she said no. I asked if we could eat out instead, so that she could get something vegan and I could eat non-vegan, and she said she didn't want to do that. I responded that I would skip Christmas dinner, in that case. She and other members of my family are quite upset at me.\n\nI feel I've tried to compromise and she hasn't. I feel I may be TA, though, because she wasn't opposed to me cooking my own food and bringing it over, but I would have rather eaten out than made an entire separate meal and transport it.

In this option, be explicit on leaving at (..X time or within 15 minutes..) time to make it to larger plans.

It's hard to understand how your desire to eat cheese and butter can't be satisfied every other day of the year. Perhaps bring a tub of butter or shredded cheese and put it on everything you eat?", "Tell me you never host without telling me you never host. So three days before Christmas she hasn\u2019t:\n\n+spent time planning the meal\n+spent time AND money buying ingredients \n+completed any prep work of either the meal or her home\n\nAs someone who voluntarily hosts and is a trained chef to top it off I guarantee you she has done all these things and more, yet she is willing to overlook your ungrateful , childish behavior and allow you to bring your own non-vegan food and not even be put out that your think your family and her work is worth less than a pat of butter. How you cannot see the problem here is beyond me.", "You\u2019re here for validation, not an answer, and you\u2019re not going to get it. You\u2019re acting childish because of one meal someone else is cooking for you. Spend your day alone, I\u2019m sure that will put you in much better spirits; the way you\u2019ve acted here, I\u2019d imagine it\u2019d also cheer up those who would have been in your company.\n\nMassive YTA.", "Stop arguing.

Sure it's nice to spend Christmas with family, but if you've has a stressful year, and they make that worse and you don't like the food being served, it's perfectly fine to skip it one year.

I mean, I personally don't love \"normal\" holiday food myself, but I value being able to celebrate a holiday with the people that I love. If you value a tasty meal that fits your personal preferences over spending time with your family, that's certainly your prerogative. It IS selfish, though. Mind you, people are allowed to do selfish things- I certainly do selfish stuff sometimes, we all do- but it doesn't negate that you welching on dinner for food is, in fact, a selfish choice, and does make you an AH.
