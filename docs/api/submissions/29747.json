Going to change names for anonymity. I apologize in advance as I\u2019m writing this on mobile. \n\nMy husband and I reached out to a breeder (let\u2019s call her Stacey) in our state for a puppy. Stacey let us know she wouldn\u2019t have any new puppies for a while but told us that she has a friend (Claire) in another state who breeds the same breed of dog and she has puppies available soon. \n\nWe reach out to Claire. It all goes well and we put a deposit down on our dream dog. We booked flights, a hotel, and paid for the in cabin pet fee as well as a pet carrier. We leave one week from tomorrow. Everything has been going great until we received an email from Stacey today which reads\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking about getting another pup from your puppies litter, would you be open to bringing a second puppy back with you? The pups can ride together in the same carrier and I will pay for puppy airfare.\u201d \n\nAfter discussing with my husband, and checking the pet policy with our airline, we ultimately decided it was not a good idea. We are first time dog owners and have never flown with pets before, we know we are going to have our hands full already with one dog. Especially since we will be staying in a hotel for 1 night with the puppy as well. Our airline also requires that each pet have their own carrier. \n\nI responded to her email explaining what I just said in the above paragraph and was met with this response\n\n\u201cOk I guess this pup isnt going to happen for me right now . I\u2019ll let Claire know. She was very sure you would do it\u2026 We\u2019ve transported 2 pups in the same bag many times . I wonder which airline isnt allowing that. \n\nI reiterated, \n\n\u201cAgain, I really am so sorry! We are flying (airline) and that's what it says on their website.  But our main reason for saying no is that we are first time dog owners and we have never flown with pets before. We know we are going to have our hands full already with one puppy. Especially since we will be staying overnight in a hotel with the puppy as well.  I hope you can understand where we're coming from.\u201d\n\nAnd then this lady says,\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok , I\u2019ll have to find a way to get her here  or not get her . I\u2019ve traveled with 2 puppies on United several times in the same bag . It\u2019s allowed. Oh well, thanks for your help.\u201d\n\nI have not responded to her. I don\u2019t know why she keeps fixating on the airline rule as I\u2019ve explained to her twice that it is not the reason we don\u2019t want to do it.

She is clearly just trying to profit off you buy trying to source another dog at a cheaper price than if she does it herself.\nIf she was planning on getting a dog anyway, having the experienced breeder deal with the transport would seem to be the much more practical solution...

Claire may have heard a very different story from Stacy. \n\nYou should know that depending on the breed you\u2019re getting, purebred dog people can be fairly clique-y.

There\u2019s no logical reason why OP/husband should change anything this close to getting the puppy.", "If I was breeder 2 and breeder 1 contacted me to say that someone I referred to them wouldn\u2019t bring back a second dog I wanted I\u2019d question why. When I found out it was because they were first time dog owners and uncomfortable with bringing back 2 puppies but were feeling guilty/pressured in to saying yes, I\u2019d reconsider my business with breeder 1.", "Not the place for this", "idk why you're getting downvoted you didn't lie. I was thinking the same.", "I grew up in the country and the people who would dump dogs were NEVER breeders but rather irresponsible pet owners who didn't fix their animal.\n\nIf you wanna preach at someone, preach at my MIL, it's HER business.

I could absolutely see that happening here, and the texter not realizing why you think they are being passive-aggressive when they were just explaining their thought process.", "Cause you are getting the breed and therefore temperament and characteristics you want. Often for pedigree breeds breeders offer genetic testing for common ailments within those dogs so you know the health beforehand. Or certain risk factors you need to be prepared to take on like hip dysplasia which is more common in certain breeds. \n\nIt\u2019s from a puppy so you know the dogs background and can ensure training and socialisation from a young age rather than risking a dog with an unknown background with kids or potential stressors. \n\nJust like the police use GSD for their innate characteristics or service dogs often being labradors. Shouldn\u2019t they then adopt? With a particular breed you can be more certain than with adopting of the behaviours the dog displays.\n\nAnd it\u2019s personal choice, you want to adopt they want to find a reputable breeder. It\u2019s not like they are buying from a puppy farm. It\u2019s helping the breeder with their income and raising their own family too.\n\nIn response to the OP NTA as they would be responsible if anything happened to the breeders puppy.

Pardon my offering an alternative in an uninvested way while you do whatever that just was.", "It's always the place to remind people that selective breeding is something human beings inflict on dogs, not at all something nature intended. Our obsession with cherry picking the traits we wanted have doomed so many dogs to life long health problems and the overcrowding of shelters.", "Why not? I didn't enter a top-level comment, so it isn't counted in contest mode. It's reddit. People are free to agonize over spending literally thousands of dollars on a dog they know essentially nothing about. And I'm free to ask them to consider why that might not be ethical.", "I used to feel that way too, that it was okay that people buy specific breed dogs, not everyone can handle a rescue.  In fact, I bought my dog a few years ago. But I live in one of the highest puppy mill areas in my country and it's truly disgusting what breeders do.  A couple months ago someone who couldn't sell their lab pups put them in a big dog food bag and beat them and threw them in the dump.  Not all of them were dead and the guy working heard them crying.  He killed them to put them out of their pain and he was distraught, really messed him up. \n\n   Puppy breeders are often fucked up people.  Where I'm from breeders are usually religious extremists and dogs are just a commodity, not pets.  They abuse the mothers and dump the puppies if they don't sell and then start again.\n  \n So yeah, it's always the time to remind people not to buy dogs from breeders.  I love my dog but I would never buy from a breeders again.", "U mean irresponsible pet owners that bought their pet from a breeder?", "Let me put it this way, if I were in OP\u2019s shoes, I would gladly let someone chip in for the cost of getting my dog home in exchange for having to watch a second bundle of puppy love for a day.\n\nMoreover, if one business refers me to a competitor, I\u2019m pretty impressed by that first business. They could have always hoped I\u2019d buy from them when they were back in stock.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t call it \u201centitled\u201d as much as \u201csurprised\u201d that help was not reciprocated.", "I think the difference is whether you consider pets as property/toys or family members. Eugenics aside, it's worth a little effort to contact local shelters and meet doggos who are there through no fault of their own. Yes, reputable breeders treat their animals well, but they directly contribute to the problem that there are just way too many dogs and not enough homes. These are not wild animals who can be rehabbed and released. We made this problem and we refuse to do anything about it. The number of dogs euthanized every day for a simple lack of resources is staggering. These aren't dogs trained to fight or dogs with severe medical issues. They're just the shitty part of the supply/demand equation.\n\nIncreasing the supply of dogs through breeding (of whatever kind) is always going to push the equation towards excess supply. And supporting breeding through buying pedigreed dogs is indirectly pushing that equation in one direction.\n\nFurther, a [recent review](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-022-08351-9#Tab1) found that basically the only clear genetic association with behavior is that smaller body size is associated with higher fear and anxiety. This could just be the fact that inbreeding for size basically makes it easier for psychological problems to exist. So buying from a breeder isn't guaranteed to get you any specific temperament.", "It's almost like there are breed specific rescues for people who are hellbent on getting purebreds", "They are NTA for not flying another puppy back.\n\nThis person wasn\u2019t getting a service dog or a police dog. They were getting a \u201cpurebred\u201d dog as a status/vanity symbol.\n\nThousands of dogs and puppies die every day in shelters due to lack of space and lack of people adopting. Consciously adding to the dog overpopulation makes breeders and people who buy from breeders massive AHs.", "Genuine question - what do you see as the benefit for OP if they make the switch? \n\nThe way I view your suggestion, only breeder 1 benefits and they seemingly have had no involvement beyond referring OP to breeder 2.

And OP would have to go buy a second carrier as well. Two puppies is a ton of work. The airline requiring one per carrier makes a lot more sense that trusting some person that \"she's done it before\". Why would an airline allow that? What if they get in a fight, or get sick while in the same kennel? That's not the move of a good dog owner, it's irresponsible and shows they are putting their own interests before the puppies. I don't think this women is a breeder with good morals either. \n\nEntitled is EXACTLY what it is. And we know EXACTLY why she referred her to the competitor, too.", "This is my view also, she offered to pay the transportation cost. Of course the OP was in their rights to decline, but was 1 night with 2 pups instead of 1 such a big deal?", "But you still don\u2019t know the background of the dog, if it has certain issues, if it\u2019s been abused, if it\u2019s aggressive or reactive. When you buy a puppy you socialise it yourself to be good with kids, good with cats, good with other dogs, know there\u2019s no background of abuse which could make it snap in certain situations, any medical issues which will cost thousands. People don\u2019t often give up expensive purebreds for no reason.", "If they have puppies, they\u2019d re always from puppy mills. Where else would they get them?", "Have you tried to adopt from rescues?\n\nHalf of their \"breed specific rescues\" are vaguely similar mutts with no guarantee they'll have breed specific qualities, and if you *do* care to adopt one of them it's more difficult then adopting a freaking child. They usually seem like animal hoarders that have no actual desire to adopt out.\n\nI've been following a few rescues for a couple years. Dogs without major medical or behavioral issues are rare, and the healthy ones have dozens of applications. \n\nTelling people to use breed specific rescues is like telling someone struggling to conceive to just adopt.

A chihuahua can be aggressive and violent, but they\u2019re not gonna rip your face off or tear your flesh from your bones.
