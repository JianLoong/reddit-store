Going to change names for anonymity. I apologize in advance as I\u2019m writing this on mobile. \n\nMy husband and I reached out to a breeder (let\u2019s call her Stacey) in our state for a puppy. Stacey let us know she wouldn\u2019t have any new puppies for a while but told us that she has a friend (Claire) in another state who breeds the same breed of dog and she has puppies available soon. \n\nWe reach out to Claire. It all goes well and we put a deposit down on our dream dog. We booked flights, a hotel, and paid for the in cabin pet fee as well as a pet carrier. We leave one week from tomorrow.

The pups can ride together in the same carrier and I will pay for puppy airfare.\u201d \n\nAfter discussing with my husband, and checking the pet policy with our airline, we ultimately decided it was not a good idea. We are first time dog owners and have never flown with pets before, we know we are going to have our hands full already with one dog. Especially since we will be staying in a hotel for 1 night with the puppy as well. Our airline also requires that each pet have their own carrier. \n\nI responded to her email explaining what I just said in the above paragraph and was met with this response\n\n\u201cOk I guess this pup isnt going to happen for me right now . I\u2019ll let Claire know. She was very sure you would do it\u2026 We\u2019ve transported 2 pups in the same bag many times . I wonder which airline isnt allowing that. \n\nI reiterated, \n\n\u201cAgain, I really am so sorry! We are flying (airline) and that's what it says on their website.  But our main reason for saying no is that we are first time dog owners and we have never flown with pets before. We know we are going to have our hands full already with one puppy.

I don\u2019t know why she keeps fixating on the airline rule as I\u2019ve explained to her twice that it is not the reason we don\u2019t want to do it.

She is clearly just trying to profit off you buy trying to source another dog at a cheaper price than if she does it herself.\nIf she was planning on getting a dog anyway, having the experienced breeder deal with the transport would seem to be the much more practical solution...

Claire may have heard a very different story from Stacy. \n\nYou should know that depending on the breed you\u2019re getting, purebred dog people can be fairly clique-y.

Picking out a pet isn\u2019t the same as picking out a new piece of clothing, you have to consider the morals behind your actions and not just what you think is the prettiest breed or the friendliest breed or the smartest, etc. If you actually care about other species (especially those we\u2019re responsible for) then you need to consider what\u2019s best for them, not just for you. I do agree though that the bigger problem is with the system and not individuals, but that doesn\u2019t make your individual actions justified.

My perspective is based on the fact that I value the lives of these animals and would do what\u2019s best for them even if it\u2019s not what I may want in an ideal world. It\u2019s great that dogs can be helpful in terms of performing tasks, herding, etc., but we are responsible for their well being. Their usefulness to us is not more important than that.

She has a large house in a rural area and six years later (and lots of expensive training), the dogs are still not left alone with the kids. Mostly because children are egocentric and will absolutely grab ears, tails, and whatever else.

We only know this because one girl who was there told her mom in a lighthearted \"Haha yeah that party was crazy\" way. He survived but parts of his ears were melted off and his skin and airway are permanently scarred. He's the sweetest cat ever. We also got a call a couple years ago that a group of kids and a couple adults had beheaded a litter of six kittens and then beaten the mother cat to the point she had to be put down. That was probably the most gruesome scene I've ever come up on and I still have nightmares of it. We've taken in cats who were thrown out car windows, tossed off the roof, left to drown in the lake, and more.

The blame for that falls on backyard breeders who breed their dogs at a breakneck pace in an effort to make money, and always to the detriment of the dogs themselves. They do not screen potential owners for a good match with the breed, and instead give the puppies to anyone with the cash.

Always wait to pay for your dog until you see the conditions of the dog's family.", "My experience with horse people is that they chose horses as a profession because they really don't interact well with people.", "I don\u2019t have the time right now to type a big reply, and I\u2019m also not trying to sway anyone one way or another. I just think that they should be open to accepting the pretty legitimate reasons people opt to buy a dog (from a good reputable breeder.)\n\n ***But,***\n>I\u2019ve never met a purchased dog that has actually had genetic testing done \n\nThat is incredibly strange, genetic testing before breeding is literally the *standard.* I can only hope they\u2019re confused and only their *puppy* wasn\u2019t genetically tested, because it was most likely desexed or contracted to be desexed so any carrier genes didn\u2019t matter (and it had it\u2019s own personal clean bill of health.) \n\nIf not, that means the people that bought that dog didn\u2019t really look into responsible ownership or breeding. You\u2019re talking $200 on average for testing so the pups don\u2019t inherit some nasty health conditions (such as IVDD or DM.) Also, health testing almost always includes eyes, heart, knees and elbows (x-rays) and a subsequent all clear from a vet that it is a good looking dog to be placed in a breeding program (unrelated to breed standard as well, of course)  I know of a breeder who had all of her Dalmatians tested for deafness as puppies on *top* of the check list above. Breeders do this because they are almost never doing it for some insane income and aren\u2019t attempting to cut costs for more overhead. They\u2019re doing it for the betterment of the breed. \n\n I have two adopted corgis, say in the future I wanted to buy a corgi from a reputable breeder. My absolute first non-negotiable would be one that tests breeding pairs for IVDD, DM, and the genes that link up to cause hip dysplasia or knee osteoarthritis (and can provide those records.) Doing a quick search there\u2019s 6 *near me* that do all of the above.", "OMG. I cant read anymore of these. I cant handle it.", "Well yeah there\u2019s no guarantees, just probabilities.\n\nMy Momo is thankfully very precious about keeping clean.", "It was really just a rhetorical question and reply to you stating that adopting the puppy doesn't always work out for the family.", "That's cargo. They are flying in cabin.", "Likely that the people I know with purchased dogs either got them from an unlicensed breeder, bought a \"hybrid\" dog (doodle mixes, e.g.), or yes had them spayed/neutered.\n\nI definitely have not looked for breeders near me, so you're likely right about that. It may depend on where one is located (thinking of Missouri, the puppy mill capital of the continent).\n\nRegardless, I don't buy that behavior (especially companion pet behavior) is so ingrained in a breed that people can ethically ignore the shelter dog situation in this country in favor of buying a dog because it's better for their home life.\n\nMany shelter animals have behavioral problems yes. At the very least, adopt a puppy from a shelter. I live in NYC, there are just-weaned puppies available for adoption at the local municipal shelters every day. They literally can't accept more dog and cat surrenders right now because they are at capacity. Which means they are euthanizing animals left and right because the municipal shelters are required to take in animal control cases.\n\nI would have no problem with ethical breeders if the big picture situation wasn't so horrible. It doesn't matter much to me if your 3000 dollar dog is healthy and happy when you're financially propping up a system that demands the death of thousands and thousands of dogs for no better reason than that no one wants to take care of them. These aren't toys or wild animals. We did this. We have to fix it. Or we can ignore it in favor of our own little bubble. I'm glad that you are a responsible pet owner. So is everyone in my family. But that doesn't make it okay that the system is the way it is. And it doesn't absolve you or me of responsibility.\n\nThe pets deserve better.", "Ugh, I hate doodles! You have no idea the temperament you'll get or the genetic problems. Both of these are two of the biggest reasons why I encourage shopping for families. I don't want my dogs back in the shelter 30x or put down due to a bite record. But in this case, it's the same gamble.", "Are you being willfully ignorant about why people may not want a pitbull? There\u2019s tons of issues that can arise from adopting one. Also btw my local shelter (and all of the many that I have been to in my state) is 99% pit bulls as well, the other 1% also being large breeds, so anyone who wants a dog smaller than 75 pounds literally cannot adopt from a shelter here. I can also back this up with my multiple years of volunteer experience and two+ years of searching for a small dog for myself at shelters and never finding a single one that wasn\u2019t 15 years old already", "no, it doesn't, but it does 95% of the time as long as they put the effort in for training it young. Anything past that is their own fault tbh \ud83d\ude2a Regardless of shelter or bought", "Those are the guidelines for pets traveling in cargo, not cabin.", "No, I just don't buy into breed stereotyping.\n\nI was simply going off my experience, which is that there are many different breeds of dogs available at the shelters in my area.", "95% is pretty good, I'm glad to learn that statistic.", "She was absolutely trying to talk them into. When someone says no and you continue to argue their reasons for saying no, you\u2019re being rude and manipulative. If someone says no, even if you\u2019re really disappointed, you respond with something along the lines of, \u201cNo worries. I understand.\u201d Even when you don\u2019t understand their *why*, you have to accept their \u201cNo.\u201d", "I don\u2019t know if stereotyping is what I would call it. I mean not everyone is willing to accept that kind of risk when adopting a dog. Even with pits that are raised in loving homes from puppies bad shit can still happen more often than in other dog breeds"]}
