Going to change names for anonymity. I apologize in advance as I\u2019m writing this on mobile. \n\nMy husband and I reached out to a breeder (let\u2019s call her Stacey) in our state for a puppy. Stacey let us know she wouldn\u2019t have any new puppies for a while but told us that she has a friend (Claire) in another state who breeds the same breed of dog and she has puppies available soon. \n\nWe reach out to Claire. It all goes well and we put a deposit down on our dream dog. We booked flights, a hotel, and paid for the in cabin pet fee as well as a pet carrier. We leave one week from tomorrow. Everything has been going great until we received an email from Stacey today which reads\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking about getting another pup from your puppies litter, would you be open to bringing a second puppy back with you? The pups can ride together in the same carrier and I will pay for puppy airfare.\u201d \n\nAfter discussing with my husband, and checking the pet policy with our airline, we ultimately decided it was not a good idea. We are first time dog owners and have never flown with pets before, we know we are going to have our hands full already with one dog. Especially since we will be staying in a hotel for 1 night with the puppy as well. Our airline also requires that each pet have their own carrier. \n\nI responded to her email explaining what I just said in the above paragraph and was met with this response\n\n\u201cOk I guess this pup isnt going to happen for me right now . I\u2019ll let Claire know. She was very sure you would do it\u2026 We\u2019ve transported 2 pups in the same bag many times . I wonder which airline isnt allowing that. \n\nI reiterated, \n\n\u201cAgain, I really am so sorry! We are flying (airline) and that's what it says on their website.  But our main reason for saying no is that we are first time dog owners and we have never flown with pets before. We know we are going to have our hands full already with one puppy. Especially since we will be staying overnight in a hotel with the puppy as well.  I hope you can understand where we're coming from.\u201d\n\nAnd then this lady says,\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok , I\u2019ll have to find a way to get her here  or not get her . I\u2019ve traveled with 2 puppies on United several times in the same bag . It\u2019s allowed. Oh well, thanks for your help.\u201d\n\nI have not responded to her. I don\u2019t know why she keeps fixating on the airline rule as I\u2019ve explained to her twice that it is not the reason we don\u2019t want to do it. We have been so excited up until this point and this situation is really taking away from this special event in our lives. \n\nAm I the asshole????", "created_utc": 1698367954, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17hbimt/aita_for_not_agreeing_to_bring_an_additional/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, that Claire would just happen to have one and be \"sure you would do it,\" like why was she sure? She doesn't know you? Stacey likely pressured the others the same way she pressured you and that's why they ended up agreeing.

Not all breeders are bad. A very tiny minority are doing important work to preserve dog breeds and make sure new generations of dogs are healthy and temperamentally sound!  \n\nBut something like 90% of breeders these days are for sure terrible, and should not be supported ever.", "That\u2019s great, in theory. The vast majority of rescues are incredibly particular about who they allow to adopt animals. And if they\u2019re just letting anyone adopt, they should be avoided. \n\n\nMy dog is from a breed specific rescue, (GSD) and I had to show them vet records from my previous dog, why I no longer had her (euthanised) why I chose to euthanise instead of trying surgery, what sort of training would the dog receive, have I ever had a reactive dog, have I ever had a large breed. And then I still had to do 3 meet and greets, then agree to home visits for 2 years. They wouldn\u2019t have even considered OP as a suitable adopter. \n\nAnd depending where you are, the rescues that would allow first time owners, are usually filled with dogs with undisclosed behavioural issues, or undesirable breeds.

Because they aren't comfortable traveling with two puppies when they've never done so with one? If I was the second breeder and you tried that, I'd tell you to pound sand.  Not wanting to do a favor for someone they have no relationship with has no bearing on their ability to be good pet owners.", "Why though? OP doesn't even know Stacey. OP isn't even a client of Stacey's. The only relationship they have is that Stacey recommended another breeder when they asked about dogs. Why should OP basically become an unpaid employee of Stacey's business? Did Stacey offer to cover any costs, propose a pickup schedule, give a reason why OP should work for her without any compensation?", "All of those replies were passive aggressive.

Breeds that are less likely to shed or less likely to make people allergic, or have common temperaments or health problems you can potentially track because of parents are all valid reasons to get a dog from a reputable, safe breeder over adopting a dog from a shelter.\n\nIt's nice to think adopting is always the way because it helps a dog in need, but it isn't and OP is NTA for just getting a dog she wants.", "Pitbulls are not bad or even an actual breed. Any animal can be made violent like a \"pit bull\"even a cat. If you knew anything about what dog fighters(and also just bad owners) do to these dogs to make them act like that, you wouldn't be saying that. \nI myself have a bully breed. If she bites you on accident she feels bad, she's never bit a human or cat on purpose. We got her from someone who stole her from a dogfighter, you couldn't touch her because she'd go ballistic. We trained the previous training of the dogfighter(which was easy easy because she was about 8 weeks old, and that \"training\" was just the withholding of food and taking from the mother too early, as well as we assume, some sort of violent \"play\" because if you play with her in a certain way she gets funny) \nThat's all being said because this same dog who was being trained to fight other dogs, is now so gentle, she doesn't bite, and if she does on accident(like while playing with our puppy) you can tell that she feels bad and she will apologize in her own way.
