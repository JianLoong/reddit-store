Now there\u2019s a friction between us.\n\nI once had to have this exact sort of conversation with somebody in an apt building I lived in.  I told them that it pains me to have to discuss this delicate and extremely private matter with you.  If you are embarrassed, then you can imagine that I am too!  Frankly put, I cant help what I hear in my own apartment and bc of your noise, *Im involved in your business*.  Where I dont want to be!  I want my own privacy.  I want you to have your own privacy  and not make me aware of your lovemaking.  \n\nThat being said, its understandable in multi dwelling construction, there will be some sound travel.  But an over the top porn star performance is too much...  I get she is embarrassed and so are you.  This is one of these uncomfortable conversations where there is no easy way.  You just have to rip of the bandaid and get it over with.\n\nI dont think you are TA for bringing this up with your neighbor.  NTA", "NTA\n\nAre you hearing them through thin walls or are they leaving window(s) open?\n\nThere's a very real possibility they are just exhibitionists who are enjoying your reaction.", "NTA\n\nWhen you live with shared walls like this, it's with the understanding that you need to pipe down at certain times. Now we all love a good time in bed, but have some respect for others. No need to be porn star loud every time, multiple times a week.\n\nThey were probably pissed as they were embarrassed.", "NTA. \n\nReproduce [this note](http://www.thedailytop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/50aabeee547a443260b7a9f7981722b2.jpg) and leave it on their door.", "Many years ago, when I lived in LA, I had neighbors like that in the small apartment complex I lived in. After one particularly ( maybe spectacular) evening performance, a bunch of us stood outside their balcony in the courtyard and loudly applauded, shouting \"Bravo, bravo! Encore!

(or fake this by using a realistic laugh track)\n\nIf they don't stop, talk to the other neighbors and emphasize they're creepers who know children can hear them and that makes them louder.

They'd have no certain way of knowing how well the sound carries unless they're on the other end of it, and when you confronted them with it they were probably pretty embarrassed. Music carries differently than voices. Some people go straight into a defensive position when challenged like that, especially if you don't know them. Yeah, would be great not to hear it, but don't tell me y'all don't get wild sometimes and make too much noise? Happens to the best of us occasionally, unless you don't have sex (which is fine). Ultimately you let it be known in a mature manner, which is all you can do.", "Honestly... NAH.  Living situations with shared walls are not ideal because you can hear other people living next to you, but as long as the noise doesnt come during quiet hours, there really isnt anything you can or should do.  If you dont want to hear the noises of your neighbors, move somewhere where you wont be sharing walls with anyone.  They have every right to have sex in their apartment.  You had the right to make them aware of it, they had the right to respond how they see fit, now that they know you can hear them there really isnt anything you can do.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
