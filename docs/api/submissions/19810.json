I work in Pharma and perhaps I can chime in. it is essential that every CNS-related medication is obtained only after prescription of your physician.

You could develop tolerance and withdrawal from wrong dosage as well. For this reasons, sharing with other people (strangers or not) is severely ill advised. I know that people take tranquillizers all the time, and it\u2019s still wrong if not advised otherwise by your physician.

(Plus obvi it\u2019s fun to smoke it) So it stands to reason that, depending on how much sleep you got last night, what new prescription medications or other substances you\u2019re taking, what your emotional state is, plus differences in the strain and strength of the weed, that it will affect different people differently at different times, and sometimes you will need help at the airport. \n\nShoot, just remembered another one! A good friend who works in the cannabis industry was on a flight to a cannabis conference- this person can handle her smoke! - and asked her traveling companion for an edible for the flight.

I\u2019ve never had the problems you\u2019ve described. Maybe it\u2019s just your body or maybe you don\u2019t know your own limits. Either way, OP didn\u2019t ask for alternatives to weed so why are y\u2019all giving it?  That\u2019s like me saying I like Chinese food and you telling me to eat Mexican instead. It\u2019s unprompted \u201cadvice\u201d from someone who isn\u2019t a medical professional. \n\nY\u2019all are acting like it\u2019s heroin or something. It\u2019s an herb that\u2019s been scientifically proven to have medicinal effects. That\u2019s the point I\u2019m making. I won\u2019t be explaining further.", "You think an addiction to benzos is comparable to an addiction to weed? I didn\u2019t say one pill would cause an issue. I said it\u2019s weird to be like, I know you said you like weed, but you should try pills instead. And it\u2019s especially irresponsible to offer them to strangers on a plane.", "it\u2019s a plant based medication the same way aspirin is - it helps with anxiety, pain, nausea and more. just because it doesn\u2019t work that way for you doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a villain", "Yeah regular weed smokers can usually function perfectly fine while high. Your body builds a tolerance to weed after a while. I'm assuming OP takes edibles frequently if she can casually take one before a flight. I took an edible on a train once and had a panic attack.", "She said she smokes weed regularly so we do kind of know OP\u2019s tolerance level.", "If OP is planning on taking an edible pre-flight, I would also go so far as to assume OP knows how to function while high and doesn't need a babysitter as much as they don't want to be a babysitter.", "You can travel with weed within Canada  \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6", "Which can be really obvious for alcohol, but not really the same with weed.", "You're a pearl clutcher, sounds like you would be surprised just how many people take edibles or smoke before their flights lol.", "> There is a difference between skate park and an airport. You know security and stuff...\n\nI mentioned skateboarding because its a challenging thing to do and yet, many of those people are doing it stoned. Not because I thought they were comparable locations. Security is not an issue, were not talking about transporting weed.\n\n>also its not you who will bear consequences of your impairment but the stewardess that will have to help you in an emergency.\n\nLol. This is why I brought up those examples. Experienced smokers can function perfectly fine. Especially with properly dosed edibles. \n\n>Also even if it's legal, just as alcohol, they may not let you in if you are visibly intoxicated for liability reasons. That's the reality\n\nThey don't care. Unless you're being an idiot, no one gives a shit...period.", "OP wants to avoid anxiety over the baby. I think weed isn't the best option to use on a plane, especially if you aren't a frequent user. I was giving him an alternative", "\n\n>You think an addiction to benzos is comparable to an addiction to weed?\n\nDidn't say that.  I simply responded to you acting as if you can't get addicted from weed, which is false\n\n\n\n\n>I didn\u2019t say one pill would cause an issue.\n\nWell, since he would only need one pill, I don't really get why you are so upset about my suggestion.\n\n>And it\u2019s especially irresponsible to offer them to strangers on a plane.\n\nI'm sure you saw the joke there, genius \ud83d\ude09", "Very true. Gave my poor bf a 20mg gummy to try and he had just a terrible night with anxiety and nausea. I pop two 125mg edibles and draw for 6 hours, take a walk, admire some bugs, great time", "Yup usually! That\u2019s why I said not every person!", "But it also can be obvious with weed, and it's a risk OP really needs to think about before getting high AF and trying to board a flight.", "Taken in from a country where marihuana is illegal,  yeah I would be shocked \ud83e\udd37", "With how many benzo related deaths there are, it\u2019s a lame joke. The addiction and relapse on it is life ruining and deadly.", "Lucky you! Haha I get very quiet/anxious when I\u2019m too high. A few hits off of a joint is usually the max I can handle.", "Why are you assuming they would be getting \"high af\"? \n\nThey even mention in another comment that they have a high tolerance, and have no intention of getting too high.", "Come to California my friend, if you're ever curious. There's a million good reasons to visit that have nothing to do with pot though since it doesn't really sound like your thing.\n\nWhere are you from?", "I'm not assuming, I'm exaggerating to make a point. Personally, I wouldn't have an edible before getting on a flight. That might be a risk that OP is OK with, but they need to be aware that there is a possibility that this will lead to them not getting on that flight.", "Poland, I'm not sure I want to visit US after reading reddit \ud83d\ude02", "Read comments before you write a rambling paragraph. I was talking about recommending pills over weed to someone who likes and has access to weed. It\u2019s a weird move to be like oh you like edibles? You should try Xanax instead. She wasn\u2019t asking for an alternative."]}
