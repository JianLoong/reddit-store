I work in Pharma and perhaps I can chime in. it is essential that every CNS-related medication is obtained only after prescription of your physician. This is because the dosage is related to physical parameters and your personal anamnesis. Moreover, you might take a specific drug for an off-label purpose, and your need may be different from the need of another person. You could develop tolerance and withdrawal from wrong dosage as well. For this reasons, sharing with other people (strangers or not) is severely ill advised. I know that people take tranquillizers all the time, and it\u2019s still wrong if not advised otherwise by your physician.
