I am aware that she presses my partners child/my stepchild constantly for information about happenings in our home (as he has told us how much it bothers him and asked for advice about what he should say) so I have little doubt that this will extend to this mate too. \n\nGoing off her previous 6 consecutive relationships, relationships seem to last around 4-9 months before the \u2018love bombing - let down - victim\u2019 cycle has run its course, so this one will be over soon(ish?).\n\nAm I the asshole if I don\u2019t allow this kid to hang out here while his dad is in a relationship with the ex?\n\n** edit to clarify something that\u2019s come up in the comments **\nMy query is only in relation to this mate being ~ in my home ~\nAbsolutely no issues with this kid or their friendship, not that it would prompt me to interfere, just as I don\u2019t with my \u2018biological\u2019 kids friendships.", "created_utc": 1673605669, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ar8g7/wibta_for_not_allowing_the_child_of_his_exwifes/", "score": 119, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But don't cut the kids off. Take them to the park. Have them ride their bikes together. Maybe go see a movie or something. Keep their friendship going in a space *outside* your home to control the flow of information.", "NTA but try to maintain contact outside the home. I understand that this is difficult because you need to protect your family without punishing your stepchild.", "Yeah, YWBTA...\n\nYou'd be punishing a kid because you don't get along with their father's gf?\n\nNothing you've said here justifies that to me...", "YTA.\n\nDon't punish the kids because of their parents.", "INFO: Does your stepchild still want to have this friend over? Curiosity about a peer's family and home life isn't totally abnormal, so I wouldn't assume that the friend is only inquiring to collect intel for their parent and the ex. Teaching a kid how to navigate prying questions is a good lesson regardless. However, if your stepchild isn't concerned to the point of not wanting to have the friend over, don't be an AH.", "NTA, I think.\nIf I am reading your posts correctly the ex will pump this poor kid for information every time he is at your home.  I have known people like this in the past.  You might be doing him a favor by doing most things outside the home until the issue dies down in a few months so he doesn't have to deal with her grilling.", "NTA. I see literacy continues to be a problem in this sub. No reason they can\u2019t remain friends OUTSIDE your home, but you have no need to go courting drama by having the child inside your house.", "Okay, so I see a lot of people who either didn't read or misread what you wrote. I don't see anything that states you don't want your partner's child to be friends with the other child, just that you don't want the friend in your home.\n\nHow does your partner feel about this? If you both agree, then that's it. You don't have to host anyone you don't want to.\n\nThe preemptive strike you're laying down here is... interesting. I don't know if the ex has been so toxic that you're right to be worried or if you're going overboard here.", "NTA.  Who comes into your home is a personal decision.  The factors that impact on your decision are also personal decisions.   Some people will be disappointed, but that is a concern only if you choose to make it so.  IMO the child seeking family information should not be allowed in your home, because of the nature of his questions.  Just my thoughts.  You decide. Be happy.  Be safe.", "Yes YTA - the kids want to be friends, let them be friends. The kid can't help who they're related to / their domestic situation, they shouldn't be penalised for something that is out of their control. Be the grown up here", "YTA for trying to dictate who a child can choose to be friends with", "YTA.\n\nYOUR KID is friends with another kid. Full stop. Not friends with their parents or anyone else. You are actively trying to dictate who they can and can't be friends with because you can't find it in yourself to set feelings aside for their own sake. Kids being friends doesn't mean you have to like their parents. My mom didn't like some of my friends parents (hell, they didn't like some of my FRIENDS) but they said nothing and let me make my choices. They only stepped in if I came to harm. \n\nIf that CHILD did something to deserve being banned from your home, that's a separate issue. But right now, you are punishing a kid for the sins of the parent, and that's AH behavior.\n\n If you don't like the partner coming with, don't let them. THAT I'm on board with. If THEY in turn don't let the kid come well that's no longer on you, it's on them. \n\nAlso, by the way the ex acts by your statements...it's wholly possible the kid asks so many questions because he's trying to work out in his brain why his home is so different...kids are inquisitive. It's also wholly possible he's being coaxed into asking, in which eliminating the partner coming along would potentially stop. \n\nEdit*typo abs add another thought", "YTA \n\nYou are saying the kids are good friend i would understand if it was a forced friendship somehow but the kid has nothing to do with it why punish both of them.", "YTA, do not drag the kids into the parents relationship issues. You will only create resentment in your stepchild", "NTA but perhaps you can keep the kids friendship going in the short term through playdates outside your home, in the park etc. So that there is less home stuff for the child to innocently report. If things are so bad you have to be no contact, then you are totally right to be concerened about a foot in the door, however innocent.", "YTA\n\nYou don't get to dictate who your STEPCHILD is friends with.. It's not even your kid. You mentioned it yourself, the other kid isn't bad or whatever.. It's the mother you have issues with. So put it aside and realize that the kid isn't instantly like his parent and let your step kid hang out and make friends with whoever they want. \n\nEspecially as a stepparent you have no right to \"allow\" anything regarding friends.", "YTA\n\nThese children are friends and their relationship should have absolutely no bearing on how you feel about the ex.

However, all the more reason to NOT single out this friend by not allowing them over when other kids are invited over. That's way juicier meat to give the ex than anything else - I wouldn't give her that satisfaction. \n\nI also understand that it's a weird situation to navigate, especially when you're NC with the ex. I don't think you're an AH, but yes, YWBTA if you singled this kid out.", "I\u2019m going to say the prevailing responses here are clearly from people who haven\u2019t had to deal with this level of craziness.  You encouraging step kid to socialize with this kid in alternate settings is protecting the kids as much as yourself.  \n\nThis is a great solution and you don\u2019t mention the kids ages but if they are old enough maybe a gentle conversation about keeping them out of adult problems and vocalizing support of their friendship would not be out of line.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "The things that the ex perceives as success are the observable material things\u2026 such things are present in my home.

Ex is apparently willing to use whatever info she gets as an excuse to act batshit and apparently assault OP.\n\nNTA for wanting to cut off a point of ingress.

You want to put a dent into a friendship your child/step child has. You\u2019re more concerned that you\u2019re uncomfortable. Guess what sweetie, being a parent/step parent means making sacrifices for your child/step child. Please learn how to cope with this instead of punishing the kids", "YTA.  I am sorry you aren't comfortable but that's on you to figure out how to deal with.  Punishing a kid over this is simply wrong.", "YWBTA. It's not the child's fault who his parents are. If he had never behaved badly in your home, there is no good reason to ban him.", "She\u2019s concerned the kid is gonna tell the ex some precious secrets like the submarine codes or the Lost Arc location", "The thing is, whatever happens will be used against you. You don't let the other kid into your house? That'd be thrown to your face somehow. You don't let them be friends on your time? (And I get that's not what your saying) How dare you punish a child like that! \n\nIf they are good friends and hang out a lot, and you have your stepkid 50% of the time, chances are that arranging things outside the house always will be hard. And at some point, the ex will figure out you don't allow her stepkid in. She sounds like she will use every and any thing you do against you, so whatever you decide, make sure that your stepkid doesn't suffer because of some limitations that might not work or might backfire.", "And who wants anyo snooping on their household.", "I agree with this, and said it somewhere else. Not inviting the good mate for a sleepover will be 100% used against you. Everything is used against you, so limiting the relationship will definitely hurt your stepkid, and won't avoid the confrontation anyway.", "This is the biggest \"who cares?\" I've seen in a long time. \"Oh no, my partners ex knows I didn't do the dishes last night. What am i going to do\"?\n\nWho give a flying leap? If OPs partners ex has so little going on in their life that they feel compelled to spy on them for no reason there's nothing going to stop that.", "NTA. \n\nBut given your timeline of how long these things last, I think you can probably get around having to deal with this issue head on. \n\nFor example, plan a lot of the playdates outside the home- movies, park, etc.- and if it is difficult to say no to them coming home with your son a few times, just make sure that you are keeping an eye on them so you aren't worried about them getting in to something, making up a story, etc. \n\nI can appreciate why this makes you nervous, given how the mother acts but also that the kid is asking pressing questions. So keeping the friendship outside your home is a good idea, and the few times they do come over, keep it short and very public.", "NTA,", "YTA. Don't discuss anything you don't want repeated. You'd be punishing the kids for an adult problem.", "She has said in another comment though that she would take them out of the house to the park or the movies or something. She\u2019s not forbidding them from being friends. Maybe you should re read her post and her comments . She\u2019s NTA", "Honestly, the ex can take something small and blow it up and try to take op's husband to court. Just because they don't have \"submarine codes\" doesn't mean they shouldn't protect their privacy.\n\nThe kid is not their kid, not the ex's kid, and is just a friend of the stepchild.  Op doesn't have to have the friend of her stepchild in her house if she doesn't want to. It's not hurting the friendship to not be able to go to every single place together.", "In your opinion she\u2019s not and I respect that. In my opinion she is.\nYou don\u2019t think the kid is gonna wonder why they always have to be out of the house? You don\u2019t think he will negatively internalize this?", "I mean absolutely. But maybe she could do half and half. Let them do fun activities in a outside location , and still occasionally come to the house. She can limit it but not so where it makes the other child feel bad.", "Sounds like someone who's never had CPS maliciously called on them", "Because the partners ex physically assaults OP when she deems that OP deserves it for the things in her house. Did you read her comments?", "I agree that would be a good solution. But that\u2019s not what the OP is putting on the table. I worked as a child therapist for a while and I know how kids tend to internalize and this could be internalized as rejection."]}
