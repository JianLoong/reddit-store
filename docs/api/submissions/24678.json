My wife (33F) had our first child right out of college, so getting a mini was not exactly practical. Currently we have two children (12 & 6) and my wife is a SAHM by choice. I have said many times she can go back to work and we can pay for childcare, she does not have to be a SAHM.\n\nI have spoken with my wife many times about getting the car, she shoots it down which is valid, we like comfortable lives but my wife is big on putting all extra money into our kids future. \n\nWith the context set, here is the conflict. November I turn 35, and I got a pretty decent bonus from my performance review. Normally the bonuses I get go into the kids college fund.our oldest already has close to 75k in his fund, and I have plenty of time to play catch up with our youngest. I took the bonus, plus some extra cash I have been setting aside separate from everything else, retirement, rainy day fund, and our emergency savings that is in a high yield savings account. \n\nI spoke with our financial advisor he suggested I investment the cash value of the car and finance the car since I was to qualify for a low interest loan. I did just that. Fast forward I bought myself a 2024 JCW fully loaded Mini Countryman. \n\nMy wife was not pleased, she was extremely upset. I know i sound have ran it by her, I knew she was going to say no. If my wife wants anything and it is possible for me to get it I often get it, our children get ro experience every opportunity they want within reason. I am not going to pay for something just to have our kids drop it two weeks later, they have to show a real commitment to it. We are not hurting for money. I have done right by the family for many years and felt it was okay to get something for myself. \n\nMy wife started to yell, I explained everything from above to her she was not having it. She was concerned about size, and I jokingly said that is why i got the clubmen, it is a bigger car. She did not find it funny. I said we still have the minivan we can also use that if we need more space. While she was yelling i told our oldest to get his brother ready we going out for icecream. He honked the horn, and i interrupted my wife and told her this fight is not going anywhere I cannot return the car, so let us go out for icecream. She lipped fuck you, and gave me the finger so the kids and I went out for icecream. So reddit was I the AiTA here? I do feel my wife overreacted a tad, she put me in the dog house and is not talking to me.\n\nDid thus on my phone, apologies for the typos and errors in advance.\n\nSorry added a T to SAHM\n\nEdit: I apologize it was recommended as per replies requesting more info. I was asked would I be upset if I my wife had done the same. She has and I was not upset. She bought a minivan, now I get a minivan is not a dream car. I came home from work saw the mini van in our driveway all I said was new car? She replied yeah we needed a larger one and that was the one I wanted. Asked about the Financials and left it at that. She felt she needed it and we could afford it, that was good enough for me.\n\nWe had a car prior that was still fairly new, and had plenty of space she felt we needed more.", "created_utc": 1692088053, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rmlu8/aita_for_buying_a_new_car_without_consulting_my/", "score": 442, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is OP\u2019s dream car and she was never going to say yes to it despite the fact that OP makes enough that the car is basically going to cost them nothing.

It's not just about the money (although that's a huge deal), it's about the fact that you didn't bother to discuss it with her to decide if it fit in your financial plan. There was no communication.

His individuality does not end and I don\u2019t want him to compromise on a hobby of his.", "Op tried she wouldn't listen", "Lol. Righto. You clearly are letting your emotions cloud your judgement here.", "This whole comment exactly why I don\u2019t see how op can be wrong!\n\nIf it\u2019s meant to be a partnership how come she\u2019s fine to always say no to him but not bother getting a job to contribute when kids are in school.\n\nThe comments are obviously biased since his wife is a sahm. Would be totally different here if the roles were reversed.", "Yeah there's no law that says your kids have to have college funds. He doesn't even know if his kids going to go to college. My parents didn't have college funds on any of their four children. Did all four of us go to college? Yes. And only one of them went on student loans and that was my sister getting her master's degree. Two of us went to private school as well. My brother went to the Air Force Academy so that was paid for and my sister went to a state school so that saved my parents some cash as well. Of my own children only one graduated from a 4-year college. One has his associates. One has college hours but opted to go the IT route so certifications are what he needs, not college. Everybody doesn't need college. Everybody doesn't need a college fund. \n\nAnd this woman's level of disrespect for her husband telling him to fuck you and flipping him off is egregious. I wish my ex-husband had cared enough to take care of his family and make sure we had enough when I was a stay-at-home mom and we lived in near poverty. I chose to raise my own children for 16 years at home supplementing his income with running a business and substitute teaching because it was important to me that my children had a stay-at-home parent but my ex certainly never would have contributed to college funds even if we had had extra money. (We did have extra money but he decided it was his.)"]}
