My wife (33F) had our first child right out of college, so getting a mini was not exactly practical. Currently we have two children (12 & 6) and my wife is a SAHM by choice. I have said many times she can go back to work and we can pay for childcare, she does not have to be a SAHM.\n\nI have spoken with my wife many times about getting the car, she shoots it down which is valid, we like comfortable lives but my wife is big on putting all extra money into our kids future. \n\nWith the context set, here is the conflict. November I turn 35, and I got a pretty decent bonus from my performance review. Normally the bonuses I get go into the kids college fund.our oldest already has close to 75k in his fund, and I have plenty of time to play catch up with our youngest. I took the bonus, plus some extra cash I have been setting aside separate from everything else, retirement, rainy day fund, and our emergency savings that is in a high yield savings account. \n\nI spoke with our financial advisor he suggested I investment the cash value of the car and finance the car since I was to qualify for a low interest loan. I did just that. Fast forward I bought myself a 2024 JCW fully loaded Mini Countryman. \n\nMy wife was not pleased, she was extremely upset. I know i sound have ran it by her, I knew she was going to say no. If my wife wants anything and it is possible for me to get it I often get it, our children get ro experience every opportunity they want within reason. I am not going to pay for something just to have our kids drop it two weeks later, they have to show a real commitment to it. We are not hurting for money. I have done right by the family for many years and felt it was okay to get something for myself. \n\nMy wife started to yell, I explained everything from above to her she was not having it. She was concerned about size, and I jokingly said that is why i got the clubmen, it is a bigger car. She did not find it funny. I said we still have the minivan we can also use that if we need more space. While she was yelling i told our oldest to get his brother ready we going out for icecream. He honked the horn, and i interrupted my wife and told her this fight is not going anywhere I cannot return the car, so let us go out for icecream. She lipped fuck you, and gave me the finger so the kids and I went out for icecream. So reddit was I the AiTA here? I do feel my wife overreacted a tad, she put me in the dog house and is not talking to me.\n\nDid thus on my phone, apologies for the typos and errors in advance.\n\nSorry added a T to SAHM\n\nEdit: I apologize it was recommended as per replies requesting more info. I was asked would I be upset if I my wife had done the same. She has and I was not upset. She bought a minivan, now I get a minivan is not a dream car. I came home from work saw the mini van in our driveway all I said was new car? She replied yeah we needed a larger one and that was the one I wanted. Asked about the Financials and left it at that. She felt she needed it and we could afford it, that was good enough for me.\n\nWe had a car prior that was still fairly new, and had plenty of space she felt we needed more.", "created_utc": 1692088053, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rmlu8/aita_for_buying_a_new_car_without_consulting_my/", "score": 2431, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is OP\u2019s dream car and she was never going to say yes to it despite the fact that OP makes enough that the car is basically going to cost them nothing.

It's not just about the money (although that's a huge deal), it's about the fact that you didn't bother to discuss it with her to decide if it fit in your financial plan. There was no communication.

My brother went to the Air Force Academy so that was paid for and my sister went to a state school so that saved my parents some cash as well. Of my own children only one graduated from a 4-year college. One has his associates. One has college hours but opted to go the IT route so certifications are what he needs, not college. Everybody doesn't need college. Everybody doesn't need a college fund. \n\nAnd this woman's level of disrespect for her husband telling him to fuck you and flipping him off is egregious. I wish my ex-husband had cared enough to take care of his family and make sure we had enough when I was a stay-at-home mom and we lived in near poverty. I chose to raise my own children for 16 years at home supplementing his income with running a business and substitute teaching because it was important to me that my children had a stay-at-home parent but my ex certainly never would have contributed to college funds even if we had had extra money.

That's just controlling. \n\nYour wife causes this by making you feel you couldn't mention it beforehand.

What seems like a bit of a win to you, (you can\u2019t return the car, you deserve it, just this once as you have the money set aside), is not a one sided game. Common sense dictates that there is room for other \u201crule flexibility\u201d so long as one person in the relationship can justify accordingly. Frankly it wears away at a marriage. \n\nThere is also the issue of resentment. No one likes to be the person in the relationship that has been the only one to play by the rules.

She also felt that she had to provide the transportation for everything. \n\nThe second time he did it he traded in the truck for a sedan but got a manual instead of automatic. At this time my siblings and I were about to start driving. My dad thought he was being slick and could get away with it that no one would realize how selfish he was. The problem he refused to teach any of us how to drive a manual car. He said we will break the clutch and it is too expensive to replace. Therefore, mom again had to use her car to teach three kids to drive and share it. She let us use it until we each bought our own car. My dad never had to share his car.

A car is a big purchase, and it seems like you gave this a lot of thought in regards to how to afford it financially without ever consulting your wife.

A minivan is not really a \"dream car,\" it's a functional car your wife probably purchased to help her carpool the kids around. It benefits the family as a whole, it isn't just something she wanted for herself. I bet if you asked her what her \"dream vehicle\" is, it's not a minivan. \n\nYou bought a fully loaded Mini Countryman for *yourself.* This car is something you bought to fulfill a dream you had, and you didn't really take into consideration how this purchase was going to impact your family nor if there was a car that would be a better fit for your family.\n\nI also think the comments claiming the wife should just go back to work are failing to realize just how expensive childcare is, and how much work being a SAHM is. Being reliant on your partner financially is also not a free ride like so many redditors seem to think. People keep saying because he makes the money, he gets to spend it however he chooses. How is that fair to his partner? Should she have zero say in any financial decisions just because she isn't pulling an income? How about all the work she does minding the house and raising the kids? \n\nIt just seems like people are completely undervaluing the wife's contributions to the household because they aren't financial.

This is absolutely one of those points. His wife sucks. I'd be leaving in a situation like this, but from his side, that's tough. She has zero income. Two kids.

No house needs that much cleaning and meals can be prepped ahead of time so that you don\u2019t spend so much time each day prepping meals. But also at 12 & 6 kids can help with taking care of home while learning valuable life skills. Will it be done to mom\u2019s exacting standards all the time? No, but that\u2019s part of the learning process. \n\nAnd if OP wants wife to go back to work then he has to realize home chores will need to be distributed between them.

OP's wife was a SAHM essentially right out of college, so we can assume they've been a single income home the whole time. In that time, they've purchased a home, 3 cars, put 75k (after investment returns obviously) away for one kids' college fund, another 10k-20k for another kid, have a stable investment portfolio, a sizable personal savings, and a rainy day fund. All on a single income.\n\nThey are clearly very rich. To do all of this, on a single income, OP was probably making 160k-180k right out of school (likely an engineer in the defense industry or a masters of finance at a bank), and is probably pulling close to 250k now. This car is likely to be somewhere between 1/3rd to 1/6th of OP's annual salary. This is not a \"splurge\" purchase like people are acting like it is. He'll have the car for 10-15 years most likely, and he's either already a millionaire or nearly there. I see no reason why he can't buy a midrange vehicle that he finds fun.
