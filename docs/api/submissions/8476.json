He will come back from a 9-hour shift and he will disinfect everything. When I asked him if he normally does this, he said he used to do it every 3 days, but since I moved in, he does it everyday. I had no idea he was this clean before we moved it.He comes home, disinfects while we talk about his day, and then takes a shower (the thing is, his cleaning time and bathing time varies; sometimes it takes him 30 minutes, sometimes it takes him 3 hours; I'm not sure why the time varies; he just says he has to start over because he made a mistake, but how do you make a mistake while wiping a table or mopping?(It is not like the mixture is wrong or something; he does it and then decides he needs to do it again.)\n\nWe have separate bedrooms because we both need our individual spaces. Last night, feeling lonely, I went to sleep next to him. but I hadn't bathed last night because I worked from home and hadn't gone out, so I felt clean from my morning bath. I was cuddling with him for 4 hours until he woke, which was about 4 a.m. He woke me up and asked me if I had bathed, and I said no. He actually told me to get up.He removed the bedsheet, pillowcases, and cover and put the bedsheet and stuff in the laundry. He disinfected the bed and changed the sheets and cover. Am I being insensitive, or is this an overeaction..\n\nTonight he came home and told me that I knew he didn't like when people slept on his bed without bathing and that I shouldn't do that again. I thought he was going to apologize for making me seem like a dirty skunk, but no, he warned me. I just want to know if I'm in the wrong in this situation.\u00a0\n\np.s he is a very good boyfriend and the first one to not do that weaponized incompetence thing.\n\nUpdate: I talked to my boyfriend about therapy options and how I am worried for him. He said he had been seeing the university therapist for two months in his freshman year, but she was not qualified to treat his problems, so he stopped when he saw it wasn\u2019t going anywhere. He talked to his insurance, and they told him to go to his primary doctor to get a referral, and his primary doctor gave him a list of mental health professionals he could see, but none of them are near our town, and our university is practically in the middle of nowhere. So he would have to drive 2-3 hours to see the mental health professional (he doesn\u2019t have a car) and can't afford therapy without his insurance covering some of it. He admitted that he isn't mentally sound, but he has been trying to deal with it on his own.I asked him if he has OCD, but he said that the university counselor said that self-diagnosis is dangerous, so he was not sure. I sent him the website someone here gave me for a self-OCD test handled by a doctor. He seems to know that his habits are not normal, but he has a lot going on financially. He pays a tuition plan every month, but it is not too much because financial aid covers some of it, plus he pays half of our rent. I asked him to ask his parents or siblings, all of whom are adults, for assistance, and he refused, claiming that the only way they would give him money is if he lied about the reason, and they would never let him live it down if he asked for money (when I visited them, they seemed to have a really healthy bond; they seemed really close.)

It can be a huge psychological hurtle for him if he's escalated his cleaning since you moved in together. I would try to casually talk to him about getting some help if your relationship allows for it. I could see this making things very difficult and uncomfortable in the long run. Just curious, but  was he the first to suggest different living spaces? I think it's a huge plus for all couples to have this, but he might have first suggested it because he knew he had issues and still wanted to move forward with you.

How can you say for sure he never had these compulsions around the house until you moved in together? He never had, or you never KNEW? Hard to believe these just popped up overnight. They really seem like OCD behavior, and he seems very sick. (Fixed and consistent/repetitive/predictable obsessions and compulsions, distress when it isn't just right, the needing to go back and do it over again, causing disruption to normal routines and relationships, preoccupation with hygiene, etc.) I do believe you when you said you did not want to cause him harm and were just trying to snuggle. However, I also believe that by doing so you knew that you might, and you chose to do it anyway. You made it clear that you knew from observing him how distressed it would make him to get in his bed without a fresh shower. You chose to do something that would make you feel good in the moment knowing that it in all likelihood it would make him very upset. So while I empathize with your emotional need to feel physically close to him, it's still kinda fucked up. (Hence soft AH.) He really needs professional help for his mental health, and in the meantime he needs you to be a little more understanding and a little less self-centered.", "YTA. Since other comments have pretty much covered why, I thought I would give you some insight into a similar kind of thought process (also a clean freak here, very similar to your bf)\n\nWhen you go out, you constantly come into contact with germs in the external environment- simple things like having someone sneeze next to you, or sitting down on a subway seat that other people have sat on, your 'outside' clothes making contact with 'dirty' surfaces.. to most people these are nothings because hey, if it's not wet or physically dirty, you don't really bother. But to someone with a cleaning obsession it means they're contaminated and they need to get clean. \n\nNow apply the same logic to whatever comes into contact with said 'dirty' thing. \n\nWhen you got into his bed, a reserved 'clean' area, your 'dirty' clothing made contact with all the fabrics and materials- this means, to him, that they are 'contaminated' and have to be entirely stripped, because you can't wipe down fabric the way you can wipe down a non-porous surface. It might seem like an extreme reaction, but to us it is logical, and I can understand your struggles with it, because yes, it is hard to understand! \n\nYou need to communicate with your bf and maybe get him to go to therapy. :) best of luck!", "YTA; you know he is picky about cleanliness. Know its a routine for him more than something is actually dirty. You have two separate bedrooms even; so if you didn\u2019t want an extra shower, you could have rinsed off, taken a 1 minute shower just to avoid the trigger. \n\nSo apologize and tell him next time you\u2019ll shower before hand.\n\nYou know this isn\u2019t about actual hygiene but his routine.", "YTA, \n\nGoing to bed without showering when one is available is an unpleasant behavior, and doing this knowingly comes across as pretty insensitive even if it was suppose to be sweet.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As people have mentioned, he probably wasn\u2019t meaning to be malicious if this was indeed OCD-driven, however, that doesn\u2019t mean engaging in ritual is the answer (it\u2019s actually the opposite thing one should do to treat OCD, which is why I\u2019m not NAH because if rituals are fed, this can make OCD worse). What you did (sleeping in his bed without showering) is what a therapist might recommend in exposure response-prevention therapy (but perhaps not so extremely at first), which is one of the ways OCD is treated.\n2. See if he might be willing or able to speak to a doctor. His ritualization could certainly be driven by contamination OCD (if you don\u2019t know what that is, looking that up could be a start).\n3. Decide what YOU want to do from there. Not going to lie, helping someone with OCD is HARD, especially if their intrusive thoughts and subsequent compulsions leak into your own life.

In a relationship it\u2019s helpful to consider other perspectives on a situation. \n\nMental health explains your actions but does not excuse them still holds true. This means you can\u2019t be rude or an asshole to the people around you and I still don\u2019t think he was. It doesn\u2019t not mean that you can\u2019t have boundaries or a mental illness because it has an effect on the people around you.", "> Better can mean both \"improved\" and \"cured\" depending on context.\n\nyea that's what he said", "NTA, that's a mental illness, he should get therapy for that. The \"starting over\" bit is a big red frag in that department.", "Girl .. what the actual f \u2026 get out asap. Like asap asap", "I have someone close to me who is married to someone with OCD it wasn\u2019t severe until covid and now the relationship has morphed into one of extreme coercive control. The partner controls what they can and can\u2019t eat, where they can go, when they can shower etc\u2026. Basically it\u2019s become an abusive relationship. Obviously this isn\u2019t necessarily the case here\u2026 but OP please consider what you think is acceptable to live in his space and don\u2019t let this slide to more and more with time. He should definitely be seeking support for OCD to understand what is on him or not (eg if he expects you to do things which are unreasonable but are because of his OCD you shouldn\u2019t be attacked for not always doing them perfectly), and to try to find ways to minimise it\u2019s affect on your lives. There are also support groups for partners or people with OCD which might help you deal with this. However this is something your going to have to work out if you can deal with long term as there isn\u2019t a quick fix but you\u2019re definitely not an asshole, but with a potentially undiagnosed condition it\u2019s hard to say if he is one or not, but it\u2019s definitely not behaviour I\u2019d personally except.", "Soft YTA because you know how much of a clean freak he is, so this could easily have been anticipated. He does sound OCD though.", "NTA. But this isn\u2019t going to go away. You have to decide if this is how you want to live.", "This behavior is abnormal. I agree with the other posters \u2014it sounds like your boyfriend has severe OCD. He needs help. If he cannot learn to manage it better, you need to decide if you can live with this for the rest of your lives. Especially if you want to have children. If not, I suggest you cut ties, sadly. NAH.", "delete tiktok from your phone your brain is leaking out of your ears", "Yes and no, he very clearly has OCD, and he absolutely needs treatment for that and destabilised right now if his behaviour is escalating. In the meantime, support his needs, shower before bedtime, don\u2019t interrupt his routines.", "NTA \n\nYour bf has a significant mental health issue. Having to start over if he makes a mistake is a major indicator of OCD or some other issue with control of his environment. It\u2019s ramped up with you in the home suggesting he\u2019s spiraling. \n\nHe needs to speak with a doctor. This isn\u2019t personal preference; it impacts his quality of life and yours. He needs to speak to a professional if he wants to cohabitate. That\u2019s the only reason I say he\u2019s an AH; he isn\u2019t one for having this issue. He is one for failing to address it when it\u2019s clearly impacting you (and him) negatively.", "NTA- Your boyfriend looks like he has OCD tendencies and it\u2019s often a coping mechanism used to feel safe after a traumatic event. Being sterile is his safety net and when that is threatened he probably gets triggered into panic mode. He should definitely seek a therapist to get to the bottom of this if he\u2019s open to it. It\u2019s not wrong for you to want affection in the relationship and it\u2019s not your fault he is reacting that way. He just needs to look into this problem because it\u2019s deeper then you think.", "YTA because you know he wouldn't like that and did it anyway. Then expecting an apology for something you know he wouldn't have wanted you to do.", "BF definitely has OCD. My husband has OCD and will sometimes get stuck in a ritual and need me to tell him it\u2019s okay and to stop but he has long known about his unhealthy rituals and worked hard to manage them\nAnd keep them from dictating his life.", "Yeah, I agree. Medications can be extremely effective in treating OCD. You should chat with him.", "\ud83d\ude02 I\u2019m dying, this is the last worry that should cross her mind in this case. Boy couldn\u2019t deal with two germ factories in his life!\n\nOP this guy is seriously struggling with OCD and needs help. And compassion, if you have the emotional bandwidth that\u2019s awesome.  You would not be the AH if you couldn\u2019t deal, but honestly there should have been some warning signs before you moved in\u2026", "I saw in your edit, and not sure if anyone has mentioned this yet, but most psychiatric offices offer telemedicine options (especially post-CoVid) so he wouldn\u2019t have to drive 2-3 hours to see someone. There are also online-only mental health services available. Usually your insurance provider can give you a list of mental health professionals covered by your plan if he needs help finding someone in-network. Good luck to you both! \ud83d\ude0a", "BTW wanted to clarify that OCD is often more about the ritual than the germs\u2026 him starting his disinfecting over isn\u2019t about killing germs it\u2019s about following his own process. So is showering before getting in his bed. It\u2019s not about you being grimy it\u2019s about you following the process he needs to feel comfortable.", "Agreed.  Just because he has a mental illness doesn't mean it isn't HIS space that she invaded and broke his boundaries.  It's not that big of a deal to just rinse off first.  If they shared a bedroom I would probably say differently but it's HID bed.  That's his safe space."]}
