I had no idea he was this clean before we moved it.He comes home, disinfects while we talk about his day, and then takes a shower (the thing is, his cleaning time and bathing time varies; sometimes it takes him 30 minutes, sometimes it takes him 3 hours; I'm not sure why the time varies; he just says he has to start over because he made a mistake, but how do you make a mistake while wiping a table or mopping?(It is not like the mixture is wrong or something; he does it and then decides he needs to do it again.)\n\nWe have separate bedrooms because we both need our individual spaces. Last night, feeling lonely, I went to sleep next to him. but I hadn't bathed last night because I worked from home and hadn't gone out, so I felt clean from my morning bath. I was cuddling with him for 4 hours until he woke, which was about 4 a.m. He woke me up and asked me if I had bathed, and I said no. He actually told me to get up.He removed the bedsheet, pillowcases, and cover and put the bedsheet and stuff in the laundry. He disinfected the bed and changed the sheets and cover. Am I being insensitive, or is this an overeaction..\n\nTonight he came home and told me that I knew he didn't like when people slept on his bed without bathing and that I shouldn't do that again.

It can be a huge psychological hurtle for him if he's escalated his cleaning since you moved in together. I would try to casually talk to him about getting some help if your relationship allows for it. I could see this making things very difficult and uncomfortable in the long run. Just curious, but  was he the first to suggest different living spaces? I think it's a huge plus for all couples to have this, but he might have first suggested it because he knew he had issues and still wanted to move forward with you. Since you say he's a great guy in other aspects just handle it with care and hopefully he can get some help in the long run. Good luck!!", "Soft YTA. How can you say for sure he never had these compulsions around the house until you moved in together? He never had, or you never KNEW? Hard to believe these just popped up overnight. They really seem like OCD behavior, and he seems very sick. (Fixed and consistent/repetitive/predictable obsessions and compulsions, distress when it isn't just right, the needing to go back and do it over again, causing disruption to normal routines and relationships, preoccupation with hygiene, etc.) I do believe you when you said you did not want to cause him harm and were just trying to snuggle. However, I also believe that by doing so you knew that you might, and you chose to do it anyway. You made it clear that you knew from observing him how distressed it would make him to get in his bed without a fresh shower. You chose to do something that would make you feel good in the moment knowing that it in all likelihood it would make him very upset. So while I empathize with your emotional need to feel physically close to him, it's still kinda fucked up. (Hence soft AH.) He really needs professional help for his mental health, and in the meantime he needs you to be a little more understanding and a little less self-centered.", "YTA. Since other comments have pretty much covered why, I thought I would give you some insight into a similar kind of thought process (also a clean freak here, very similar to your bf)\n\nWhen you go out, you constantly come into contact with germs in the external environment- simple things like having someone sneeze next to you, or sitting down on a subway seat that other people have sat on, your 'outside' clothes making contact with 'dirty' surfaces.. to most people these are nothings because hey, if it's not wet or physically dirty, you don't really bother. But to someone with a cleaning obsession it means they're contaminated and they need to get clean. \n\nNow apply the same logic to whatever comes into contact with said 'dirty' thing. \n\nWhen you got into his bed, a reserved 'clean' area, your 'dirty' clothing made contact with all the fabrics and materials- this means, to him, that they are 'contaminated' and have to be entirely stripped, because you can't wipe down fabric the way you can wipe down a non-porous surface. It might seem like an extreme reaction, but to us it is logical, and I can understand your struggles with it, because yes, it is hard to understand! \n\nYou need to communicate with your bf and maybe get him to go to therapy. :) best of luck!", "YTA; you know he is picky about cleanliness. Know its a routine for him more than something is actually dirty. You have two separate bedrooms even; so if you didn\u2019t want an extra shower, you could have rinsed off, taken a 1 minute shower just to avoid the trigger. \n\nSo apologize and tell him next time you\u2019ll shower before hand.\n\nYou know this isn\u2019t about actual hygiene but his routine.", "YTA, \n\nGoing to bed without showering when one is available is an unpleasant behavior, and doing this knowingly comes across as pretty insensitive even if it was suppose to be sweet.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
