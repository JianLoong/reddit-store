Everything was going smoothly until the issue of my younger brother, Alex (25M), came up.\n\nAlex has been dating Tina (24F) for about a year. Tina, before dating my brother, had a short-lived fling with my best friend, Derek. Derek and Tina ended on bad terms, and Derek confessed to me that Tina had cheated on him during their relationship. Given that Derek is not only my best friend but also my best man, I didn\u2019t want any potential drama or discomfort at the wedding.\n\nSo, I made the decision to invite Alex to the wedding, but asked him to come alone, without Tina. I explained my reasons, saying it was to avoid any possible tension. Alex was hurt and said he won\u2019t attend if Tina isn\u2019t welcome.\n\nMy family got wind of this and is divided. Some say I\u2019m justified because it\u2019s my day and I should be able to choose who\u2019s there, while others think I\u2019m being judgmental and punishing Tina for a past mistake.

Additionally, in trying to prevent potential drama, I\u2019ve created a rift between my brother and me. He feels I\u2019m forcing him to choose between supporting me on my big day and standing by his girlfriend.
