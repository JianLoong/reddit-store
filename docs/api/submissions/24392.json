Everything was going smoothly until the issue of my younger brother, Alex (25M), came up.\n\nAlex has been dating Tina (24F) for about a year. Tina, before dating my brother, had a short-lived fling with my best friend, Derek. Derek and Tina ended on bad terms, and Derek confessed to me that Tina had cheated on him during their relationship. Given that Derek is not only my best friend but also my best man, I didn\u2019t want any potential drama or discomfort at the wedding.\n\nSo, I made the decision to invite Alex to the wedding, but asked him to come alone, without Tina. I explained my reasons, saying it was to avoid any possible tension. Alex was hurt and said he won\u2019t attend if Tina isn\u2019t welcome.\n\nMy family got wind of this and is divided. Some say I\u2019m justified because it\u2019s my day and I should be able to choose who\u2019s there, while others think I\u2019m being judgmental and punishing Tina for a past mistake. I feel like I\u2019m trying to ensure peace on my special day, but I also recognize that I might be denying my brother the chance to share in a significant life event with his partner.\n\nAITA for not inviting Tina based on her past relationship and actions?", "created_utc": 1691753607, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15o6fh3/aita_for_not_inviting_my_brother_to_my_wedding/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Additionally, in trying to prevent potential drama, I\u2019ve created a rift between my brother and me. He feels I\u2019m forcing him to choose between supporting me on my big day and standing by his girlfriend. My family\u2019s division over the issue highlights the possible unfairness of my decision, and I\u2019m now questioning if I allowed personal biases to overshadow the importance of family unity during such a crucial event.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ### [Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

According to the Rules of Reddit, Tina is an UnPerson because she cheated on her SO and must therefore be shunned forever and ever Amen. Or stoned to death. </s>\n\nSeriously though, agreed. It's OPs wedding, so he's NTA, but brother is within his rights to not attend due to his SO being excluded. A conversation with all involved parties isn't a bad idea however. Including Tina. While cheating on a partner with whom you're ostensibly monogamous is bad, Reddit and it's lack of nuance tend to paint them as irredeemable demons unworthy of love and respect. I say this as someone who has been the wronged party.", "Odds are Tina will cheat on the brother also and that will be that.", "Did you not read or blatantly Ignore the part with the best man is the guy that his bros gf cheated on? Tina doesn\u2019t deserve to be there at all. Hell she is probably gonna cheat again and hurt the brother too.", "OP has the right to invite or not invite whoever he would like to his wedding.

He's been with Tina for a year, so there's a chance she'll be around for a while.

That fact is pretty important and Tina should never be forgiven for cheating. Period", "That is DEREKs version of events. It makes him an asshole to not even have a conversation with his brother.

But Derek said he'd be the bigger person because it's his best friend's wedding. OP isn't saying his brother can't take a +1. He's saying his brother can't take this particular +1, who has been his gf for 1 year.", "He'd not be siding with the cheater. He'd be inviting his brother and allowing him to bring a +1.", "He did have a conversation with his brother about why he wasn\u2019t comfortable with her going. He\u2019s not said that brother and girlfriend have denied her cheating, in fact his family are acknowledging she\u2019s a cheater as OP is \u201cpunishing Tina for a past mistake\u201d so it\u2019s not just \u201cDereks version of events\u201d If OP is uncomfortable having someone that cheated on his best friend at his wedding (the day two people promise fidelity and love to one another) then that\u2019s up to OP.

The brothers version of events of Derek and Tina's prior relationship and how that ended? Come on now.", "His family didn\u2019t acknowledge Tina was a cheater, reread the post.

Yes\nDoes the way and reasons he did this make him an asshole? Also, yes.", "I completely disagree. He's been with this person for 1 year. That's his choice.

But that's not for OP (nor the best man) to decide, it's for his brother.\n\nOP is stipulating who his brother can or can not take.

I\u2019m reading it more as, the family doesn\u2019t really know the truth, that\u2019s why the are calling it a \u201cpast mistake\u201d. \n\nA conversation MAY have helped, but he made the decision without the conversation.
