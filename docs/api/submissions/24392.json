Tina, before dating my brother, had a short-lived fling with my best friend, Derek. Derek and Tina ended on bad terms, and Derek confessed to me that Tina had cheated on him during their relationship. Given that Derek is not only my best friend but also my best man, I didn\u2019t want any potential drama or discomfort at the wedding.\n\nSo, I made the decision to invite Alex to the wedding, but asked him to come alone, without Tina. I explained my reasons, saying it was to avoid any possible tension. Alex was hurt and said he won\u2019t attend if Tina isn\u2019t welcome.\n\nMy family got wind of this and is divided. Some say I\u2019m justified because it\u2019s my day and I should be able to choose who\u2019s there, while others think I\u2019m being judgmental and punishing Tina for a past mistake.

Additionally, in trying to prevent potential drama, I\u2019ve created a rift between my brother and me. He feels I\u2019m forcing him to choose between supporting me on my big day and standing by his girlfriend.

You can\u2019t expect him to intervene based on her prior bad behavior in a relationship that had nothing to do with him. \n\nRule of thumb is that if you don\u2019t invite someone\u2019s SO to a wedding, you should expect them to decline. So you also can\u2019t be surprised. How would your brother look to Tina if he went?  They\u2019re in a serious relationship, so if he went, it would be a problem for him. \n\nI\u2019m going to chalk this up to you\u2019re doing what you need to do, as is he.

So try and handle it as best as you can.\n\nAlso if Alex and Tina get hitched, you should not expect to be invited.", "If Alex and Tina have been dating a year, Derek should be over a short-lived fling and be able to deal with it for a couple of hours. It sounds like your brother is not a groomsmen so the chances of Tina and Derek running into each other really aren't that big - it's not like they'll be tied together for the night.

There are still consequences. All of this aside, it's your wedding and no one else's; You call the shots. Your brother is a jerk.

Don't back down on this. - NTA", "NTA\n\nYour wedding.\n\nYou are not \"denying my brother the chance to share in a significant life event with his partner\".  This is YOUR life event, not his.

I'm sure that won't have any long term effects.", "YTA\nYou\u2019re willing to blow up your relationship with your brother because your friend might be uncomfortable but would ultimately behave like a rational adult.

It was a fling.  How does one cheat on a fling. Derek needs to get over it   She was a college student who had a fling with an older guy.

You call their relationship a \"short term fling\" but then you say she cheated.... Were they actually exclusive or did he want to be and she didn't so they went separate ways? How long was their \"short lived fling\"?\n\nYour brother has been with her for a year. It's your wedding and you can do what you want but she may end up being your SIL one day. I wouldn't push her and your brother away over a couple week/month fling that didn't work out between and your friend over a year ago.", "NTA you gave your brother the option to come and he turned it down it's your wedding and if you do not want to invite a woman who hurt your best friend and to minimize the potential drama that can occur on the day then that is perfectly reasonable. Personally I think your brother is making a terrible decision choosing a woman with a past of cheating and is likely to do it again over going to one of the most important moments in his sibling's life.", "I'd say that curating the guest list with an eye towards avoiding conflicts between guests is exactly what you should be doing.\n\nYour brother is being childish, there's very good reason why his gf is being excluded, and he's choosing her over your wedding.  if he wants to prove he's the bigger man, he can invite Derek to his wedding.\n\nNTA, brother is though.", "Nta", "More important INFO request: What is Clara\u2019s opinion on the matter?

Stress + exhaustion + jitters + bad blood with an ex in attendance + (presumably) free flowing alcohol = recipe for disaster, even if all parties involved want to believe they can suck it up for a day.

Tina has clearly moved on, his friend should do the same. \n\nThis is like if Tina worked at his friend\u2019s favorite coffee shop.
