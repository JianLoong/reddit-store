Tina, before dating my brother, had a short-lived fling with my best friend, Derek. Derek and Tina ended on bad terms, and Derek confessed to me that Tina had cheated on him during their relationship. Given that Derek is not only my best friend but also my best man, I didn\u2019t want any potential drama or discomfort at the wedding.\n\nSo, I made the decision to invite Alex to the wedding, but asked him to come alone, without Tina. I explained my reasons, saying it was to avoid any possible tension. Alex was hurt and said he won\u2019t attend if Tina isn\u2019t welcome.\n\nMy family got wind of this and is divided. Some say I\u2019m justified because it\u2019s my day and I should be able to choose who\u2019s there, while others think I\u2019m being judgmental and punishing Tina for a past mistake.

Additionally, in trying to prevent potential drama, I\u2019ve created a rift between my brother and me. He feels I\u2019m forcing him to choose between supporting me on my big day and standing by his girlfriend.

This is about having his brother in his life.", "Just as OP's brother is doing.", "Maybe it was brief because of the cheating? I think you are reaching a lot to achieve your conclusion, cheating is cheating independent of the length of the relationship if it was official", "She did, together with OP's brother.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBotrh will simply not come to the wedding, and if they ahve any sense they will go no contact weith OP for good.", "Why would his brother allow him to disrespect his significant other that way. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter that, both won't come tho the wedding just the same.", "What an unreasonable idea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP is MASSIVELY disrespecting his brother's relationship - so why would the brother support OP's relationship?", "\"Those who cheat in the past quite often cheat in the future.\"\n\nThis is just an uneducated prejudice. There is NO valid data to support this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is NO actual data indicating ANY of that. **YOu just made that up.**", "They won't be close after that.", "Im naive like that.", "Does not matter - any decent person would chose their partner.", ">rstand what I'm trying to say here. It's OPs wedding and thats the bottom line. As such the brother is the one who should compromise. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWrong. The brother should stand up for his partner, and tell OP to go to hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"sometimes it means being willing to swallow your objections to preserve a relationship with your loved ones.\" .. OP certainly is NOT willing to do that.", "No, because you just made that up.", "Mistakes can absolutely be conscious decisions.\n\nMistakes are actions that are misguided or wrong.\n\nYou're thinking of accidents.", "Who called it an accident?", "OP will be as ostracized.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere will be no more family events with both brothers attending. Everybody will have to chose which of the two to invite.", "I'd call it recognizing the patterns shown by people I know throughout high school, college, and adult life.  But if you think \"people who put less value into loyalty tend to put less value into loyalty\" is an inaccurate statement then you do you I guess.", "You are going to great ends to justify cheating huh?wonder why!", "This is NOT about Tina telling Alex not to come. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nthis is ALEX - he is a good person, and a good partner - deciding to stand up for his partner. He is not acceptng OP's disrespecting his relationship.", "Wrong. You should ALWAYS support your partner over some Ah sibling.", "I'm not justifying cheating, and I resent the implication that I'm a cheater myself.\n\nI've never cheated. I've been on the receiving end, and it hurts like hell.\n\nBut people make mistakes. They make bad choices. They don't need to wear the scarlet letter for the rest of their lives."]}
