If stuff like that gets spread around, I am much less likely to be cool in the future.", "Thats usually what parents say to cover up shady shit like cheating or abuse", "What're you on about? This person said it didn't happen, so I gave examples", "Yep, and old money is toxic to the new money. I had a high school boyfriend whose parents were new money. His mother didn't get invited to coffee mornings or the tennis club. One time I caught my mother saying that his mother \"earned it all on her back\". It's really gross.", "Or you get to pick your seat 24 hours before departure. British Air is this way, and I tend to pay the extra fee to pick my seat in advance.", "If given the choice, no one would pick the middle unless they absolutely had to. So, for less filled flights, you might get lucky and not have someone in between you. If you left a window or aisle open, it would be guaranteed to get snatched over any middle seat.", "Fine then, I'll be the asshole. I'm sitting in an airline seat right now, and fit perfectly fine, even as a 6 ft tall guy. They don't need to be widened. I hate when society caters to smokers (thank god that has mostly gone away) and it shouldn't cater to being overweight either.", "No because the daughter is significantly smaller and so she wouldn't be uncomfortable.  It's not the same position at all.", "Ah. Well I\u2019m a broke ass bitch sooooooo", "Imagine feeling entitled to the space he paid for.  Shocking!  /s", "She might not be able to help her weight but she can help not paying for enough room for her to sit.", "There are, in fact, airlines that have you initially pay to reserve the extra seat, and refund the second seat after the fact. Southwest is the first that comes to mind, you just contact customer service after flying to refund the extra seat, so you\u2019re reserving the number of seats you need and only paying one fare. United has special seating for those who need more width on the seat on some of their aircraft, and Spirit has seats that are a half inch smaller than the larger seats that United has for plus-sizes customers as their standard on a significant amount of their aircraft. There\u2019s other airlines that have the second seat discounted if it\u2019s for the same person as the first. Some of those airlines refund the customer if there\u2019s empty seats on the flight so they aren\u2019t paying for something that wasn\u2019t being used already. \n\nIf the flight is full and you need two seats, you should be paying for both seats you\u2019re using in order to guarantee you have enough space. I have joint issues that make it extremely difficult for me to use a standard seat, so I pay extra for the extra room I need to be able to extend my knees and move/stretch enough that I can walk properly after getting off the plane. Should the seats be bigger and have more leg room? Yes, 100%. But they aren\u2019t, so if you need more space than you\u2019re paying for, pay for more space rather than taking it from someone else who paid for the same amount of space as you did.", "The seats fit pretty much everyone. If you\u2019re obese and can\u2019t fit in a seat that\u2019s not normal", "Kids who are growing up with abuse don't necessarily know what's abusive and what isn't because it's treated as normal in their homes.\n\nA \"family business is private\" attitude keeps them from hearing any other perspective.", "Yes that\u2019s exactly the kind of thing he was covering up. There were other more innocuous reasons too though.", "Don't forget forced marriages!", "This makes sense", "If you are 6ft the statistically your life will be shorter on average (like mine) and the leading theory about that is exactly this issue.\n\nThe habitually stooping over to adjust to chairs, desks, beds and so on wrecks our bodies.  Most of my \"extra height\" is in my legs and I'm telling you those seats are a nightmare.\n\nThey literally teach in classes to screw over people of our height without a care in the world and that isn't going to change if people like you are getting pissy at the prospect of people being treated decently.  I really doubt it would make much difference to have seats be slightly larger.", "Okay. I get ya\u2019. Oh and I definitely didn\u2019t think she was uncomfortable telling her friends. More like \u2018Guess what?! I got a shopping spree because \u2026 truth\u2019.", "If a parent is likely to be abusive, a private business is private is almost always going to be implemented.  A non abusive parent isn't going to start being abusive with such a policy.\n\nI doubt it makes a difference in whether or not a child speaks out about abuse.  What we should be doing instead is educating children in schools about the different types of abuse, how to spot it, how to report it, and how to keep themselves safe.\n\nTeachers need to get more involved in the kids lives and need to be given extensive training on how to recognize and report suspected abuse.\n\nI am kind of conflicted on this because I totally get where you are coming from.  But I also don't need my kid blabbing about everything to everyone.  There has to be a balance.  I am not going to abuse my kid, so me telling him to keep that beer I gave him a secret isn't a big deal.\n\nI doubt an abuser is going to have those same morals in telling their kid what is or is not appropriate to keep quite about.  So telling people not to tell their children not to tell stuff isn't going to stop abuse or make it more likely to be reported.", "It's not OP's responsibility to make her comfortable in any way.", "But it does make it more normal that kids aren't supposed to talk about what goes on in their families.\n\nI get where you're coming from too. But not every abusive parent thinks they're an abusive parent. Probably most do not. So \"it's ok because I'm not abusive\" sort of misses the point, which is that kids get to have their own narratives about their families, and talking those narratives out together can make a huge difference.\n\nAnd I do think normalizing family secrets harms children in abusive situations. A kid who has learned, even from a healthy and loving parent, that there are some things we just don't talk about, might be less likely to report abuse from another family member. Especially because they learned from someone they consider trustworthy that it's normal to be asked to keep secrets", "So then how are we supposed to encourage reporting abuse without also running afoul of the law because we wanted to do something cool for our kid?\n\nI personally believe that being more permissive with children is the best way.  If children know they can come to you about anything, then they are less likely to hide stuff from you and do things that might harm them behind your back.\n\nSo to continue my example of the beer.  If I don't forbid my kid from drinking, and he knows that he can have a beer with me now and again, he is less likely to sneak alcohol behind my back.  This way I can monitor his usage to ensure he doesn't develope alcoholic tendencies, while also learning his limits in a safe environment.  Then when he gets to high school parties, or college, the alure of alcohol is gone and he is less likely to overindulge.\n\nHowever, that kind of thing is most definitely against the law in my state (Pennsylvania).  So if I implement my idea, and he blabs, I have a nightmare to deal with and might risk losing my child.\n\nSame thing with underage sex.  If my kid knows that he can bring his girlfriend (or boyfriend) home with him, and that I will let them fool around in their bedroom.  He isn't going to do it in a nasty location.  And if he can be open and honest with me about sex, he will be less likely to end up being a teenage father, or ending up with some STD.\n\nBut if he blabbed about my permissive attitude to underage sex, some nosy nancy might report me to CPS and I have a nightmare to deal with because I don't want my kid to have to hide from me.\n\nSo where do we strike a balance?  I am all for ending child abuse in all forms.  But how do we encourage that without having to stick to puritanical ideas about raising children?", "I don't have a good answer for you and I realize that. It's hard for me to imagine a sip of beer getting you into that much trouble since my parents shook the trouble of 911calls with amazing ease. But they were white, and affluent, and I know that isn't everyone.\n\nI don't disagree with the downsides you're pointing out, but I still think encouraging children to keep secrets about the family has dangerous consequences."]}
