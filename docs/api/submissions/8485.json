In the middle of that you just told her she was shit. I know you didn't mean to, and I really do feel for you with her constantly testing you, but someone just metaphorically fell on the floor in front of you and you metaphorically kicked them in the teeth. Apologise, explain, ask to discuss, or ask to set aside a time to discuss.\n\nGood luck OP!! You got this!", "NTA.  I don't get all the y t a as you clearly state you are smarter **at these types of games.** You even mention 3 areas in which she is smarter than you.  Maybe it's because back in my dating days I always liked smart men too, but never made it a competition.", "[removed]", "ESH\n\nOne of my ex-spouses tried to compete with me intellectually after we'd been together for over a year. My intelligence was what they claimed attracted them to me at first.\n\nChoosing to challenge me at games where I had more knowledge and experience was not a smart move on their part. That made the ex-spouse the AH.  But I never said the kinds of things you said.\n\nTell your GF that you do not want to compete with her. You want to help each other improve your abilities.", "Um NTA?\n\nI mean she tries to test you and you win so why is that making you the bad person? Are you like supposed to lose to make her happy? Is she 5? \n\nI am not that smart and other than math problems \\[I can't do math to save my life\\] I can do fairly well. Most of them have to do with practice and not that much with being extremely smart.", "NTA the only mistake you made was calling yourself smarter. You should have probably asked her :\" hey, what's up with all these games lately? Everything OK?\" She's probably going through something so you not being careful with your words may have exasperated that.", "I have this image in my head of you being a bit of a dick about it every time you \u201coutdo\u201d her.\n\n\u201cHoney, just accept it.  You\u2019re dumb\u201d\n\nDo you *really* have to ask ?.  YTA", "YTA. You handled this terribly. When someone is feeling insecure, validating that insecurity as an accurate assessment is not the way to combat it. I don\u2019t know why your gf suddenly started feeling inferior to you intellectually, but if you routinely act the way you do in this post, I think I\u2019ve got an idea. You sound arrogant and judgmental. I like intelligent guys too, but that intelligence becomes an immediate turn-off if what follows is cockiness. You should respect your gf and want her to feel confident. It\u2019s easy to get frustrated when people act juvenile in settings of competition, and to be fair, it does sound like that\u2019s how she\u2019s behaving. You\u2019re her bf though. You\u2019re supposed to be extra understanding and empathetic of her feelings. It\u2019s kind of what you signed up for. Instead, you were insulting and dismissive. Anyone would feel hurt by that comment. Your EQ doesn\u2019t seem to match your IQ.", "ESH. Your girlfriend is acting like a three year old. If she can't handle losing, she shouldn't play the game. But you didn't have to rub her nose in it like she's a puppy who just made a boom boom on the carpet. It's not hard to be a gracious winner. You should try it.", "ESH. Competition is good. Testing herself against you is good. Throwing a tantrum when she loses is not good. Telling her to accept you are better is not good.\n\nWhen I was a kid I used to play table tennis with my dad - a state champion - and he used to beat me 21-0. Never gave me a chance. Ever. So I set myself the target of getting a point. Then two points. I kept learning and getting better. Although I never stopped losing to him, I could beat most other people I knew.\n\nIf your gf plays against you often she will improve. That's great, and something you'll do together. Enjoy it without the angst.", "ESH. \n\nGood on her for trying to get good at it, but she needed patience. I don't know if \"temper tantrums\" were an exaggeration on your part, though.\n\nBut you definitely weren't helping with your response. \n\nShe also sounds pretty harsh about \"dumber guys\".", "Alright I was fully willing to say YTA on this one but going with ESH. She is being ridiculous and needs to stop trying to test you then acting like a child after. And the way you worded that was...not choice. \n\nMy SO I don't think is smarter than me overall (we're equal just in different subjects) but he is insanely good at word/number puzzles. I get them eventually but almost always behind him. He'd never tell me he's smarter than me though. Just that he's better at these sorts of things. Like I'm better at visual things like jigsaw puzzles and such. My brain just does connections like that faster than he can process. Stop doing them when she gives them to you is what I'd do.", "YTA. You did sound like a condescending AH. People have different strengths and it does not mean that you are smarter than her for beating her in \u201cintellectual\u201d games. You explained yourself poorly and insulted her while doing it.", "Eurgh.\n\nClearly she feels invalidated and is trying to prove herself.\n\nBased on your word choices here, I'm willing to bet money you say some unnecessary shit that has had a hand in her losing self esteem.\n\nEven if you aren't, would it kill you to just let her have a moment? My partner has a PhD in creative writing, with a focus on poetry. She *is* a poet. When I wrote her a (surely awful) love poem, she had the decency to say \"Oh, pretty,\" and not crush my spirit in a moment that clearly mattered to me.\n\nYTA. Take a hint, man.", "Sooo\u2026 your gf talks about how important intelligence is to her and how much she values that in a partner. She\u2019s trying to relate to you on that level and show you she\u2019s intellectually compatible with you. When she falls short, she gets upset and tries another activity. When that effort falls short as well, you tell her to accept that you\u2019re smarter than she is and give it up?!? She is seeking acceptance and validation and in her eyes not only did she NOT receive that, you essentially called her dumb. Of course that would upset most people and while you may beat her at chess, it doesn\u2019t seem like emotional intelligence is your strength. YTA", "NTA\n\nShe sounds immensely insecure in her intelligence, and seems to understand very little about the definitions around intelligence in general if she thinks little games are going to be objectively quantifying markers that she can use to determine who she is smarter than and dumber than. The fact it even matters to her this much just screams toxic insecurity to me. Toxic insecurity is actually the most generous description I can give to her behavior here, because this sounds like far more deep seated problems with her than basic insecurity. \n\nIt's always the loudest people who are the dumbest. She seems to be aware on some level that she's not as smart as she wants to be in this lifetime, and instead of actually working on that she's dead set on trying to \"prove\" she's at least smarter than those around her to feel better about herself. \n\nI'm obviously biased, I wouldn't stay in a relationship with somebody like this, but I'm not going to tell you to break up over this either. I mean, per her logic you're a condescending ah despite the fact she's been repeatedly and obsessively going out of her way to try and prove to herself she's smarter than you? While also telling you she's \"repulsed\" by men that she perceives as \"dumber\" than herself? In your position I'd be sitting there wondering if there ever came a time where this person started consistently \"winning\" these games against me, would that be their indicator to then break up with me? They beat me, therefore I'm dumber than them, therefore I'm repulsive? According to that incredibly weak excuse for logic anyway. \n\nIf she wants to be a genius amongst geniuses, then it doesn't even start with these little logic games and math problems. It starts and stems from having a deep vested passion in education and **applying** learned knowledge in every facet of your life. It grows with **open-mindedness and cognitive flexibility**, two things this person clearly doesn't have. The most intelligent people I know are all deeply passionate in their particular arenas of education. I've known architects who can describe the most convoluted jargon about a regular looking building to me with shining eyes. I've known a legitimate musical genius who could almost instantly figure out how to play any instrument put in front of him. I've known a genius in mathematics who was given grants on the fly because he happened to DOODLE an idea for an algorithm that ended up revolutionizing something in his niche of research (don't even ask me to get into what he figured out, I could barely understand what he was describing to me at the time anyway). He didn't get that grant because he's naturally gifted, he was working hard in his education from middle school in this specific field of mathematics and robotics. I'd be willing to bet good money that every single one of these people are far more intelligent than your girlfriend in these specific arenas, and they may not win every single one of these little games she brings up to them, but that wouldn't make her smarter than them nor would it make her dumber than them.\n\nI don't even know what advice to give you on how to approach this situation, because you've done literally nothing wrong and there's no right combination of words that's going to snap her out of these baseless beliefs and obsessions until she herself realizes that what she's doing is wrong and not an indicator of an intelligent person. Intelligent people aren't desperate to prove just how intelligent they are, especially in comparison to others.", "NTA, so sad when a 23 has tantrums when loosing a game. \nIf you cannot handle it,stop playing. Why did uou continue playing with her? Maybe you could initiate to do the things she excels at. Make her feel better about herself.", "YTA. I feel sorry for your gf by your behaviour.", "NTA. But you said it in an asshole way and you should apologize. \nwere y\u2019all playing chess to have fun? Or do you feel that playing chess is always her testing? What do her tantrums look like ? You seem very logical in your responses to her and below. I dated a guy one time that would always beat me in chess and that kind of stuff but I knew I was smarter than him in other ways , as you stated your differences. I would never think to try to prove myself to him but, I also stopped playing chess with him bc he always won. I adore chess. I love it, I have books on it, I made chess sets before bc I love the artistry but I suck at it compared to him. It is not fun to always lose. If I always want to lose I\u2019ll just play a computer , not someone I want to date. I asked him one time to try to help teach me to play better and he refused also, and also refused to go easy on me. That was 1 of the 3 reasons I broke up with him.", "ESH. Saying that you\u2019re smarter then her may not be the best response in the moment but the fact that she constantly challenges you to these games, loses, and throws a tantrum at 23 is pretty ridiculous and outright immature. However, I think there might be a reason for her asking you to play all of these games. Sit down and have a conversation with her to get to the root the issue.", "YTA. If she wants to get more involved in intellectual pursuits why not encourage her? These particular skills you're talking about are learned, not inherent. She could learn to beat you at chess or a crossword puzzle or a math problem. Next time she's interested why not try working the problems together instead of competing? \n\nIf you're going to be a team in life collaboration with each other is more important than competition. Just because she doesn't know something now doesn't mean she can't improve at it. Six months from now she might be able to beat you at chess or solve the Sunday NYT crossword puzzle in ink, if that's what she wants to focus on. Unless she has a disability that means that she can't do a particular task there's no reason she can't improve at it. Why should she accept that you're smarter instead of working to improve herself? It sounds like you've put her in a box where she's got the social intelligence and you've got the logic. Why not both work on your areas of weakness, because it sounds like you could learn from her ability to deal with people.\n\nAlso, even when competing, you both should consider not taking yourselves so seriously. I play a particular game with a particular friend almost every time we're together, and he beats me almost every time. That doesn't mean he's smarter than me, even at logic. That particular skill is a challenge for me, but he's never disparaged my abilities, even though he's sometimes called out faulty moves. You're disparaging her intelligence, and that's unkind.", "NTA, but my brother in christ, you aren't wrong but literally the worst phrase you could use when she is very clearly sensitive about her intelligence is \"I'm smarter than you\" regardless of what you followed it up with. That being said, why is a grown ass woman playing these dumb fuck fuck games with her boyfriend in the first place?\n\nStop entertaining this dumb shit if she's gonna act like a child about it, but for the love of God avoid saying you're smarter than her in any context in the future.", "\u201cshe started crying and called me an condescending asshole.\u201d You seem to be one.

Apologize and move on.", "YTA. You're also the idiot. \n\nYou keep saying that she's the one who wants to challenge you.
