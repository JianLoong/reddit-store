I've known people that have done this, especially with abusive parents.  Just be careful NOT to say anything to anyone else about your plans to your mom or your siblings.  You really should do your own will etc. to make sure if you do get this money, it gets passed on to your siblings as you desire too.", "I don't think it makes you an asshole-- once she dies, that money is yours and you can do what you want with it.\n\nBut a word of warning-- she could live for a very long time and do you a lot of emotional damage while you wait. My narc mother has money-- she uses it as a tool for control. I cut her off knowing she would cut me out of the will. My brother stays because she treats him \"better\" when he's the only one she can gloam onto and is financially generous with him. But I can tell you, 100%, I am the happier sibling. She interferes in his marriage, his business, etc. and causes him so much extra stress that he takes out on ME because I don't \"share the load\" of dealing with her, that WE also stopped talking.\n\nIt would not be worth it to me if he came back in 20 years with a fuckton of cash for me, because the damage to his mental health and our relationship has been done. I'd rather have a good relationship with the rest of my family, but they stay beholden to her because of her money. It sucks.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is, it's a good plan on paper... but this shit never works out the way you would think. And having dealt with the probate process for two estates, one of which stretched on for almost three years, just going through all of that in and of itself is so stressful.. I'm not sure it was worth the executor's fee I was paid.  I did it because I cared about the deceased in those cases, and no one else would step up. I would NOT do it for my mother.\n\nHope this helps!", "NTA, in fact if you actually split it, this makes you a goddamn hero. \n\nBut just so you know, you might end up getting the short end of the stick here. You mom might live for a long time, and absolutely will use this to push your around.", "No judgment but being the executor of a will is a job. You have to distribute her assets as the will states. If she leaves you everything,  once it's yours you can give it to a cat charity if you want, but if she leaves stuff to others, your task would be to make that happen or get sued.", "NTA if you actually split it with your siblings.", "Nta, normal behavior, and nice youd split it", "NTA\n\nShe's your mother, so especially how she's been treating you and your siblings, you'd have the right to inherit.", "NTA\n\nIf you were to follow the will as described and receive everything - well it's yours to do with what you please at that point.

As long as you are mentally okay, then I 100% approve of this plan. The fact that you\u2019d split it with your siblings shows me that you are a selfless individual who got yoked to a horrible mother. Keep it up but keep your sanity. If you can, make sure you see the final will to make sure your efforts are not in vain. \nNta in fact I want to make up a new one called the GOAT.\n\nYou are a bit of an AH to your mom, but she is one too so it cancels out -BODMAS-and I wouldn\u2019t feel guilty about it", "NTA. Brilliant plan. Keep it to yourself, get a will and keep up the good grey rocking.", "NTA\n\nI am in a similar situation - three of us children and a nerc dad who favours whichever kid is speaking to him the most (I'm the only one left who will tolerate him but have considered going NC before a LOT).\n\nI will be going to visit soon to be the executor of his will so I will find out what he is doing with estate. Have been considering what to tell the others after then, but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.\n\nMy siblings and I are in complete agreement - whoever gets what we will split it evenly. Dad has cycled through who he thinks should (dis)inherit a number of times so we are covering our backs. \n\nI know there is very much a sentiment of 'that's what he would've wanted', and I agree with that mostly when it is people being greedy, not being selfless like you are. My aunt thinks she should get X after it was given to me by grandma! Bad. Dad is a dick so I'm gonna split up the money I'm given to my long suffering siblings!

Is it up to date, or have portions of it lapsed? If not, it may be best to just let her pass away intestate so her estate is automatically divided equally between you and your siblings.\n\nI am not a probate attorney, so you should check this advice with someone who actually practices in the field.
