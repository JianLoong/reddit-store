Your wife wants to get naked in front of others, and you're uncomfortable with your wife sharing intimate pictures that you feel should stay between a husband and his wife.  I know a bunch of kids on here are going to champion your wife's decision to share her body with whoever she wants, but in the real world, there are potential consequences.  Once those pictures make it onto the internet, there's no retrieving them.

Snap them if geographic logistics preclude in-person visit?", "1. how explicit are the pictures? we talking nude or boudoir? \n\n2. the gender/sexuality of the friend she wants to show them to would be helpful here. like is it her gay bestie, a straight girl, a straight man, a lesbian, a queer non-binary person, ect.", "INFO: Is there potential for a sexual relationship between your wife and the friend, or is it just a well established platonic friend?\n\nIf it's someone you think there may be romantic or sexual undertones with, then you should have a conversation about that overall. In that context, not wanting her to share the photos makes sense, but also the photos are not the problem, the entire situation/lack of trust/potential infidelity is the problem.\n\n\nIf it's a long established platonic friend and you don't have concerns in that regard, then you need to figure out why it bothers you and bring that up.\n\n Is it that you thought the pictures were something special just for the two of you? Is it that you don't want anyone else seeing her sexually at all? Is it a possession or jealousy?", "Potential YTA\n\nWomen share stuff like this together all the time.  We go lingerie shopping together and model them, we absolutely talk through sexy outfits for special occasions etc.\n\nIt\u2019s not about turning eachother on, or anything sexual so much as getting support.

Part of building that self esteem is having the important people in her life confirm it to her.  You are the number one important person and L is the other one. \n\nI have several friends who have done Boudoir Photo Shoots and they have frequently shared them with women who are close to them.  Not in a sexual way, but in a does this look good, am I okay, please give me feedback.", "For me personally, I think it depends on if the friend is a man or woman.", "NTA. Anyone saying Y T A needs to take a long look in the mirror. None of the edits matter. NONE.\n\nOne thing makes your wife the AH. You voiced a concern and she STORMED OFF. That isn't how adults act, she could've discussed it, eased your concerns, or pointed out how they were hers(dont really care that they were a gift) and why she would like to share them. You could've compromised by showing them but not sending amongst a dozen other things.\n\nBut no the woman didn't get her way so she threw a tantrum.", "So many people are asking for info. I say no more info is required.\nFriend or lover, male or female, explicit or non-explicit... These don't really matter as much. People don't need to pry into every little detail to satisfy their curiosity.\n\nThere are 2 simple points why this is NAH :\n\n1. You have every right to feel uncomfortable if she wants to share intimate photos of herself to another person. You're not the AH for asking her not to send it.\n\n2. She has every right to do as she pleases, regardless. She is not the AH either if she chooses to disregard your request. \n\nYou can make your case to her:\nThe photoshoot was a gift, the risk (no matter how little) of it making it to the internet, you'd feel cheated on/jealous/sad etc. etc. You're not an AH for feeling insecure. Your feelings are important and you expressing them to your partner doesn't make you the AH.\n\nIMHO her actions seem harmless as women share nudes all the time. Sometimes, they do it because they need an opinion; sometimes they do it just for a lil boost.\n\nHowever, (and this has nothing to do with the AITA vote) do bear in mind that your actions will shape the future of your relationship. So, if it is advice that you are seeking, I'd suggest speaking to a professional and not a subreddit forum.", "Soft NTA. If she shares those pictures with someone there\u2019s a non-zero percent chance they\u2019ll somehow end up on the internet FOREVER.", "After the edit I\u2019m saying NTA. It was communicated before the shoot that these pics were a gift for OP and for OPs eyes only. Her wanting to send these to her friend is kind of an AH move for going back on the agreement and it\u2019s a breach of OPs trust", "Have you asked yourself why, deep down, this makes you so unsettled? You mentioned \u201cpretty obvious reasons\u201d, and I\u2019m not sure I even know what those are. What, for you, is the big fear that is driving the discomfort?", "Question: How explicit are these photos?", "You\u2019re entitled to your feelings and having a discussion about it, but to be honest, if the friend is straight and your wife is straight I don\u2019t see the issue with her wanting her friend to hype her up. I had a very close friend- we\u2019re both straight females- I\u2019ve seen new lingerie she bought, she showed me her nipple piercings. It wasn\u2019t  anything sexual at all, it was \u201cgirl I feel good about myself, celebrate with me\u201d type of thing. Women have different relationships with each other than men do. And though you added a note at the end that you say the photos were meant for you, the whole post seems like the photos were for herself, to hype herself up and boost her confidence., and as a bonus to that you got to pick your favorite photos of the bunch. If she and this friend are both straight I would explore why it makes you uncomfortable or insecure for her to share them- it\u2019s likely this isn\u2019t the first time in the course of their friendship they\u2019ve shared a picture they feel good about themselves in, they\u2019ve likely changed clothes in front of each other before. She isn\u2019t sharing them to attract someone, she\u2019s sharing to celebrate that she was able to do the shoot and then celebrate she feels good about herself in them", "NTA. You set a pretty reasonable boundary. She had those photos taken for your eyes only...obviously that doesn't include other people outside of your marriage, even if it's just a platonic female friend of hers. I have friends who've done sexy boudoir photo shoots...and while they shared a few of the more tasteful ones on social media, they've told me some were only for their partner. It's a respect and boundary issue. If this was agreed upon before the photo shoot, then she needs to hold up to her end of the deal. She doesn't get to change what was agreed upon just because she wants her friend to see. As a bisexual woman...I don't need to see my married friends sexy photoshoot pics. That's great that they feel comfortable doing so, but it's not something I'd ever specifically ask to see or need to be shown. So, your wife is the AH here.", "INFO: is the friend male or female?", "Why are you concerned? (serious question)", "NTA. I wouldn't want my partner in life sharing her naked photos with other people. I don't think that's an uncommon take or boundary either. If she doesn't respect this boundary, I'm sorry for you OP", "NTA", "You've left out loads of stuff here.\n\nI'm going YTA for deliberately leaving out everything useful.", "NTA. You and her discussed before the photoshoot that the pictures were only meant for you. it's a clear boundary that you have set. she is TA for wanting to violate that boundary. \n\nstand your ground. if she cannot respect you, you have to respect yourself twice as hard to make up for it, so standing your ground will be hard. but if you cannot set boundaries, you cannot be happy in a relationship, so you should stand for your right to do so.", "NTA but it\u2019s pretty common for straight female friends to share stuff like this. I\u2019ve seen the \u201cbest\u201d and \u201cworst\u201d of my best friends body. She shares stuff/ vents etc", "I totally get you being hesitant for her to share those with a friend. You are entitled to feel that way. BUT those are photos of her and so long as they aren't too risqu\u00e9 I don't see a problem with her sharing them with a friend if its strictly platonic.\n\n(Can obviously be messy with a friend who may be hiding some feelings for her.)\n\nThat friend will more than likely just hype her up and give her a bit more of a confidence boost. More than likely, you have nothing to worry about with this friend, too, because if her confidence has been low, she wouldn't be willing to share those with anyone other than you or a best friend.\n\nI would definitely discuss how it makes you uncomfortable again, but you can't control what she does with pictures of herself.\n\nGonna say NAH.", "NTA, you communicated your boundaries, if she does not understand I would have a heart to heart with her discussing your feelings and how it makes you uncomfortable.", "Well, is the friend a male?   \nI'm going to assume it's a female friend and that she isn't completely nude in the photos. I would have no problem in this case, even if she was completely nude. it's her body after all.   \nI suppose I would have a problem if she was sending them to a male friend.", "YTA - if she wants to show her photos to her friend, thats her choice. There\u2019s nothing romantic or sexual about this.", "Nta, she didn\u2019t discuss sharing with others.

She wants to show off hot pics of herself to a girlfriend. If it was a couples shoot, I'd understand you not wanting them sent, but it's her body and her choice.\n\nStop making it about you dude", "NTA. I wouldn't want my wife sending those pictures to anyone.", "Suspicious of an edit that says this was a gift to you, when the original post makes it seem like this was her idea, for herself, and you had nothing to do with it. \n\nWas this friend L the one who got her into the idea? Are you okay with the friend coming to your home to see printed versions of the pics so there is no chance of transmission  to other eyes?", "YTA\n\nThis isn't your decision.  You can discuss it with her, but this really isn't your choice at all.", "I did boudoir photos for my husband in order to spice things up. It was my SIL\u2019s idea and we scheduled them for around the same time. \n\nSomething I didn\u2019t realize was how good I\u2019d feel after the experience. After they did hair, makeup, the best lighting and posing, then they did photo editing. It\u2019s was the best I\u2019ll ever look in a photo. \n\nI felt amazing. It was the biggest ego boost I\u2019ve ever had. I showed them to my SIL and she showed me hers. Then we showed them to some of our close friends. \n\nThis is the same as when women tell each other about their sex lives. Most women share this kind of stuff with their close friends. It brings us closer together. We can recommend the place that did the photo or share our experiences. \n\nOP, soft YTA. This may have started about you, but it really isn\u2019t about you anymore. You need to let this go and understand that her showing her \u201cfeel good\u201d pictures to friends has nothing to do with you and you need to butt out.

Definitely no, put your foot down and the answer is NO.\n\nHalf the cost makes you a partner.", "Just for context is the friend a male? Though honestly male or female I\u2019m going with NTA. I couldn\u2019t imagine my wife been too keen on me sending D pics to my mates", "Potentially YTA\n\nThis is HER body, these photos make HER feel good about HERSELF, and SHE should get to decide who SHE shares them with. \n\nNow, you are welcome to discuss your concerns with her, but you become the full-on asshole if you try to prevent her from showing HER photos to a trusted friend.", "NTA. I'm assuming that you two are monogamous, and you mentioned already that it was meant to be a present to you, but I feel like she lied about it being a present and really she just wants validation from people. Which if she's insecure about her mom bod then that makes a lot of sense. Maybe dig deeper into the reasoning with her why she wants to show her naked body to other people in a open, non argumentative manner. Possibly you aren't meeting her needs, emotionally. I don't agree that she should share nudes with friends because that's just opening the door to infidelity. Either man or woman, she's testing boundaries, so there's a discussion that needs to be had.", "INFO: Is she naked in the pix?\n\nIf not, it's prob okay for her to share them. Though in general I don't think it's wise to share photos online because you never know how they'll be misused.", "NTA.

They will eventually show up in the wild.", "YTA\n\nWhile you are entitled to your feelings about it, it is and always will be her decision to make. You do not get to control her by virtue of marriage, and quite frankly, it is only some pictures.\n\nBefore anyone tries the \"You must not be married...\". \"How would you feel if your spouse...\" or any other line I will answer now:\n\nMy lady has also done a sexy photo shoot, and loves to show those photos off because they make her feel good. I do not have a problem with it, and in fact, encourage her to do so if it makes her happy.", "Does her friend L have a penis?", "YTA- \nIt\u2019s your wife\u2019s body, and she wants to share artful pics with a platonic friend. Don\u2019t overthink.", "NTA- I understand you want to keep these photos private. Unfortunately, you can\u2019t control that. If she doesn\u2019t text them to her friend, she\u2019s going to show her on her phone. It\u2019s guaranteed. If they came out good, I would show my friend too! I would never text them out though because the internet is forever. \n\nSo this is one situation where you\u2019re going to have to take a knee. Im older so I would ask her to promise that she won\u2019t text them/share via email for her protection or show them to any males. Her images could land in the dark web. That would be my red line so I would ask for the promise and trust her to keep it.", "If it\u2019s a female friend then it\u2019s okay. If she\u2019s a good friend then her friend will tell her how great she looks and your wife will feel even better about herself.

This is supposed to make her feel good and another woman will absolutely hype her up, not just say she\u2019s \u201cattractive\u201d. \n\nYou\u2019ve taken something that was supposed to be about her and twisted it into being about you. She\u2019s probably already sent them because it\u2019s another woman and she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal because to women, it\u2019s not. She looks hot and she wants to share that with her friend so they can giggle together and hype each other up, pretty normal female behaviour honestly. \n\nThe way you\u2019re objecting is a bit weird, like WHY don\u2019t you want her to share them with her friend? The photographer already saw her naked and has the original copies. Who knows if they\u2019ll post them on their website or social media as part of their portfolio? Her friend is probably far more trustworthy than that stranger", "Me and my friends change etc infront of each other. My friend had a boob job and sent pics of her new boobies. \n\nI think you are over reacting slightly", "I'm going ESH on this one.\n\nI don't think this is an AITA question. I did one of these photo shoots. They were my photos. I was proud of them. I shared them with whoever I want.\n\nUltimately, your wife isn't your property. The photos, if she's paid for them, are her property and she can do whatever she wants with them (except use them for advertising something because of legal stuff most likely). And that includes sending them to whoever she wants.\n\nNow, when it comes down to your relationship and how that's going to affect you, you are well within your rights to let her know. And if she cares more about your feelings than possibly getting external validation then she won't share the photos.\n\nAs a woman who's fairly confident, I can't 100% speak to needing external validation. It's nice, because who doesn't like to be told that they're attractive, but I don't think I would need it in this particular circumstance. However, I haven't had any children so it's possible that being validated and being seen in an attractive way from someone you consider a peer can give her a confidence boost. I'm not sure why you would want to deny her that.\n\nHonestly, I think you should let it go and you should celebrate the photos with her.", "Married women don\u2019t need to share their body or pics of their bodies, just like married men shouldn\u2019t either. You made vows and each spouse belongs to the other. By sharing photos of herself she\u2019s violating her vows to you and this is completely unacceptable!

Not sure why she needed to have a huge photoshoot with a friend in the first place. She could have purchased some nice lingerie and asked YOU to take pictures and store them securely. This sounds suspect imo. You obviously don't want these to leak out to your children. Put your foot down and tell her NO! She will respect you more if you are stern and less if you cave in.

Either way, communication is key.", "Honestly, YTA\n\nSe did the photo shoot as a way of gaining confidence and if she has the confidence to share them with a friend then that\u2019s amazing. Her body, her choice. If you\u2019re uncomfortable with that, that\u2019s a you problem.

That way they stay secure, but she can share the self esteem boost from her friend cheering her on?", "I share everything with my girlfriends.

It's perfectly reasonable to not want your partner, regardless of gender or sexuality, to send nudes to anyone besides you. Even if they were made with the intention of allowing anyone to see them, OP is clearly upset by it and that should be enough to rethink. I'm also seeing people use the friend's gender as an excuse, but as a woman I have never wanted to receive nudes from any of my female friends. I could understand a picture with lingerie, but a fully bare photo? Obviously she can do whatever she pleases, as she's an adult, but that doesn't mean OP has to go along. \n\n>I told her Im not sure I'm comfortable with these being sent to others (for pretty obvious reasons) friend or not. She responded by swiftly walking away.\n\nI have serious concerns if she can't hold a proper conversation about boundaries. A little worrying that she couldn't even acknowledge your feelings. Maybe she isn't an adult...", "NAH. You can feel a certain way about her sharing, and she can share. What sucks is that she stonewalled you when you said something.

She said that her husband would be nice and say they all looked good but she wanted real feedback from someone else who had given birth and could look at the pics from a lens other than \"I have to tell her they look good or it will tank my sex life.\" \n\nSo I think YTA because you think you have the right to deprive your wife of an opportunity to get non sexual supportive feedback from her best friend on something that was probably a huge emotional risk for her.", "Yeah, it feels more like he assumed that. When she brought up the idea, did she say oh these are just for you to look at or more of a I'm sure you'll like them!!", "He didn't say she explicitly stated it wasn't for his eyes only.
