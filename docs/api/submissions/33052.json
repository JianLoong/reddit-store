We had grown apart and I felt like she was taking advantage of me. After all this time I wondered if it was just me not setting clear boundaries, and since she just posted she had another baby I thought it was a good time to congratulate her and ask her how she was. She apologised for how she acted the last time we spoke and I convinced myself it'd be fine. \nToday I was reminded of all the reasons I didn't wanna see her anymore. From how she tried to convince me to get back in touch with my very manipulative toxic family, because you need your family... to punishing her oldest child cause he got headlice at school for the 4th time... \nCause she just had a baby I brought food to feed the whole family for the day. We had some for lunch but there was loads leftover. I drove her to her gyno appointment so her mom wouldn't have to drive her (she can drive though but never does, often her husband has the car and he doesn't want her to drive his car... but they could easily have a second car), but fine I drove her cause I thought it was stupid for her mom to drive half an hour just for a doctors appointment. I helped in the house, took care of the baby so she could do some other things she wasn't able to when she was alone with the baby (which I didn't mind... the baby was cute and I wanted to help). She asked me to photograph the baby (I am not a pro but I do take pictures for people from time to time and normally get paid a bit for my effort). \nI brought a gift for the other child cause I didn't want him to feel left out. They ended up getting take out in the evening (while I spent the night before prepping for all the food) and she asked me what I wanted so I had a pasta for like 11 pounds... \nafter her husband left to get it she told me I wouldn't mind paying for my food cause it would get to expensive for them to pay for mine as well... I literally brought my own waterbottle (I always do) I didn't dare to charge anything for the pics cause she was suggesting it was good for my portfolio, I brought a gift for her son,... \nI ended up pretending I was fine with it but I was shocked...

If this was the only thing the friend ever did to OP or an occasional gaffe, I highly doubt they'd think anything of it. \n\nIn my experience and community, it's usually assumed the host will provide food, and it's usually assumed you buy a meal for someone helping you out, ex. buying pizza for everyone who helps you move. It's inconsiderate to expect everyone to split the bill after they've done so much to help - far exceeding the cost of the meal - unless you're all young adults constantly trading favors. \n\nTo me, it sounds like this is just a reminder of the disrespect they've dealt with in the past after OP overextended themselves to be helpful after a long friendship break - presumably where they've both grown. She took a risk and was immediately reminded of why they weren't friends. The over extension to be helpful is entirely their fault, they shouldn't have done that to themselves, but that doesn't mean their friend isn't being rude and ungrateful.
