{"id": 1058, "submission_id": "ylnv6p", "title": "AITA for calling my sister \"obsessed\" with her (deceased) husband?", "selftext": "I (35M) was one of those kids that knew exactly what I wanted to do when I grew up. In order to remain anonymous, I'll simply say I've always dreamed of doing job X at company Y. My whole career has been based on getting this job and working for this company. So needless to say when I finally got an interview with company Y I was ecstatic. \n\nAfter a very lengthy interview process, I received a phone call yesterday letting me know that I had gotten the job. I was so excited. I immediately called my parents, who were so proud of me. My dad suggested that we go out for dinner to celebrate at our family's special occasion restaurant. They wanted to take me and my sister Megan (33F) out to celebrate the achievement. I was riding on cloud nine. \n\nI called my sister to tell her the news and the dinner plans. She congratulated me, but told me that she wouldn't be able to come. My mood immediately dropped, and I asked her why not. She told me that she had plans already with her (deceased) husband Miguel's family. \n\nI explained to her that this was a serious achievement that had taken a lifetime of work, and that I had finally achieved my dream. I told her that I needed her there to celebrate with me. She congratulated me again, but told me that this was a very important family celebration and she simply could not miss it. \n\nFor context: Megan and Miguel were married for a few months before he passed. It was really tragic, and she has my deepest sympathies. I understand how important he was to her, although I don't exactly agree with how she's handled his death. I understand her sorrow and sadness, but don't agree that she should be missing out on celebrating my achievements because her husband passed. She can (and does) mourn any other day of the year, but this is a once in a lifetime achievement. I got my dream job and she of all people should know how much that means to me.\n\nThis is the part where I may be a bit of an asshole. I called her out and said that missing out on her actual families celebrations to celebrate her husband's death with his family is a dick move. I told her that she couldn't spend the rest of her life obsessing over Miguel, and that at some point she needed to move on. Her obsession with him was ruining our relationship, and once again re-iterated that I needed her to be there with me tonight. \n\nShe actually laughed at me and said that \"of course she was obsessed with him\". She said a few other hurtful things, before\u00a0she hung up the phone. \n\nMy parents and I ended up going out for dinner just the three of us. Today my sister texted me and said we could go for dinner this weekend if I apologize for acting like such an ass. But I honestly don't think I should have to when she missed out on my thing. She also said some hurtful things, and doesn't seem to think she's in the wrong at all. So I want to know, AITA?\n\nETA: A lot of people are bringing up \"Day of the Dead\". This is honestly something I had never heard of before, so I don't feel like I can be judged for not knowing that.", "created_utc": 1667533250, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylnv6p/aita_for_calling_my_sister_obsessed_with_her/", "score": 358, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A celebration dinner isn't something you bully an adult into attending.", "OH WOWWWWW, YTA \n\nYou said he and his family are Mexican. It was Day of the Dead. They were getting together to celebrate loved ones who have passed. It is a holiday with HUGE cultural and/or religious meaning to a lot of families. \n\nI am SO GLAD your sister is empathetic and sensitive enough to know how important the day could be for Miguel\u2019s family and grieve with them. Your ignorance about your brother-in-law\u2019s culture (AND THE CULTURE YOUR SISTER MARRIED INTO) is so sad. On top of that, your refusal to educate yourself on the holiday to \u201ccelebrate dead people\u201d shows how little you care about understanding your sister\u2019s loss. \n\nCongrats on your job.

You have a major case of Main Character Syndrome, and need to step back and realize that your sister\u2019s life does not and will never revolve around you.\n\nShe already had other plans.  She is still mourning her late husband.  Both of those things take priority over celebrating *your* achievements.", "YTA.\n\nShe already had plans, and those plans meant something to her.\n\nYou trivialize and characterize her mourning as obsession, yet your expect her to drop things in her own life for *you.* As the first poster says, it sounds like you've got some profound main character syndrome going on.  The \"dick move\" here was yours.", "YTA. Actually, you were the AH before your horrible comment to your sister. Also, your other comment about not agreeing with how she handled her late husband\u2019s death shows how cruel and selfish you are. Since when do you get to decide the right way to grieve? She explained why she couldn\u2019t attend your celebration dinner and already had a commitment on a very specific day. \n\nHow hard would it have been for you to have your celebratory dinner a different day? Did you consider that? You had a chance to do the right thing, but wouldn\u2019t, because it\u2019s all about you. \n\nYou should be ashamed. Apologize to your sister.", "YTA\n1.

You didn't care enough to share those details with us. \nYou probably did work hard and you should feel proud of your achievement, but you should put some effort towards learning some empathy as well.", "YTA. You seem very callous about her grief. Not everything revolves around you.", "YTA. It really doesn\u2019t matter why she couldn\u2019t make it, she had other plans. You planned this dinner and then just demanded everyone else make it work because it\u2019s what you wanted to be the center of attention.

Your career achievement is great. But she already had plans. Why should she cancel them for something you sprung on her? Why can't YOU reschedule?\n\nAnd you're disgusting for your comments on grief. She'll move on when she's ready. No one else has the right to comment on it. From your posts, she's doing ok everywhere else. She's just still loving her husband and is not yet ready to move on.\n\nShe may say she's never going to date or isn't taking her wedding rings off. But she may when the time is right. If she's not ready to be in a new relationship, it's better she doesn't try yet. It'll complicate the new one. But none of that is your business.\n\nBecause she couldn't come to your career celebration, you insulted her grief.", "So just to be clear, you organised your celebratory dinner on the annivesary of her husband's death?\n\nYou wanna tell us how long ago Miguel passed away?", ">She can (and does) mourn any other day of the year,\n\nDay.

You couldn't be more of the AH if you tried.\nWhat right do you have to tell someone when they should be finished grieving?\nSure, you got a job. Congratulations. Your sister LOST. HER. HUSBAND. \nYou're beyond type A personality. You're selfish and emotionally immature.", "YTA you mentioned how long they were married, but probably they were dating much longer and you also don't mention how recently he died. In any case, meeting his parents for Day of the Dead doesn't make her \"obsessed\" and unless you're literally becoming an astronaut (which is doubtful since part of that job requires emotional intelligence), your job celebration dinner isn't more important.", "Congratulations on getting the dream job! It's understandable that you're over the moon excited but you're still YTA. \n\nYou're thirty-five and should be well beyond the stage of wanting the world to revolve around you. If it's so important to you that Megan be there for your family celebration, why couldn't you tell your parents she already had plans and arrange the dinner for the next night?\n\nAnd yes, you're definitely an AH for assuming that she should just abandon her plans with Miguel's family, and that not doing so means she's unhealthily obsessed with her late husband. And also for apparently being willing to ruin your relationship with your sister over it. Apologize and go to dinner with her. If it's really important to you, you can tell her how you were really hurt by whatever she said, and maybe she'll apologize too. Since you didn't say what those hurtful things were, we can't make a judgment on whether she might also be an AH here.", "Every single word drips with entitlement. I almost refuse to believe this is real, given the child like mentality OP presents - even in his own retelling. \n\nYTA", "YTA you could have asked your sister why she couldn\u2019t celebrate.

You have very twisted logic. You don\u2019t get to control how long a person grieves *their dead husband*. You sound selfish and egotistical.", "YTA. You've never lost someone extremely close to you, have you? Grief does not have an expiration date. While you getting your dream job may have been the best day of your life, the day her husband died was, no doubt, the worst day of her life. It doesn't matter that he died five years ago. The pain of losing him will never go away. Since I can think of no better comparison applicable to you, how would you feel if you were fired from your new job? I'm sure you would feel devastated and, rightfully, grieve what you lost. Seeing as how you built your life around attaining your prospective job, I'm sure the pain of being fired would stay with you for a long time. \n\nTry to put yourself in her shoes. There will always be time to celebrate your achievement. There will never be enough time for your sister to \"move on.\" She will be affected by her husband's death for the rest of her life. It's not her being \"obsessive.\" She is grieving. Consider yourself fortunate you've yet to experience her pain.", "Geez, was there a specific reason you couldn\u2019t change the date of your celebration dinner!\nYTA!", "YTA. \"Me, me, me!\" \"My, my, my!\" So it's not enough that you got this job. You need everyone throwing bouquets at you 24/7 and forgetting other important things in their lives that YOU think aren't as important as yours. Yikes, you sound insecure, if not downright narcissistic. And please don't ever say your sister's in-laws aren't her real family. She bonded with them! Oh, but noooo, they're not in your inner circle, so how can they possibly matter?", "INFO: Why couldn't you have celebrated on a different day in order to accommodate her prior commitment?", "YTA\n\nMy dude... my brother in Christ... from the bottom of my heart... go f#@% yourself.\n\nGet over yourself.

It was a last minute and she had already made another commitment.  There is no evidence here of her being obsessed", "YTA because she said that she already had plans.

No \"I apologise but I just think that...\", no \"I apologise but you said x, y, and z\".    \n\n\nSay \"I apologise for my behaviour sis, it was insensitive and hurtful and I will do better in the future.\"", "YTA. It's just dinner dude. You can't expect people to just drop everything to go have dinner with you. It sounds like she's still getting over her late husband's death, and the thing she was going to was probably really important to her, and you basically just shit all over it when you didn't get what *you* wanted, so I'm not at all surprised she's mad.", "YTA You made last minute plans to go out that night, she already had plans. It doesn't matter what those plans were. You acted very entitled to expect her to be available on such short notice. When you talked about her dead husband you went to far. You can't tell anyone when and how it is ok for them to grieve. Just because she had plans with Miguel's family doesn't mean she was experiencing grief at that moment. She could have been invited to a party, a dinner or just to visit. It is considered rude to cancel one commitment to go to another. Apologize to your sister for being an entitled Ass.", "YTA.  You and your parents are not your sisters only family.  She was married to someone, so his family is also her family, regardless of whether he\u2019s dead or not.  She lost her partner, of course she\u2019s going to be grieving for a long time.  You don\u2019t have to agree with her grieving process, but the least you could do is respect it.  It may seem silly that she\u2019s been grieving him for so long, but just because you haven\u2019t experienced losing your partner, doesn\u2019t mean her feelings aren\u2019t valid.  Grow up and realize the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you.", "That's a lot of me-me-me going on in that. You sound pretty obsessive yourself. YTA here. She already had plans with other people.

What a nasty thing to say to her.", "YTA, this must've been a huge achievement but people aren't obligated to come and celebrate the day with you, especially if they're currently in mourning.

Congratulations on getting the job, but OP needs to understand that grief isn't something to be rushed and that their sister needs patience.", "YTA-  You couldn't have rescheduled your celebration dinner? Since it meant so damn much to you for your sister to be there to celebrate, but nooo. She had to drop her prior commitments with her late husbands family and you don't care because this is supposed to be about you. To hell with her dead husband and his family, right?

The comment about her late husband is just icing on the asshole cake.", "Yta and you are the only one obessed.  Your inpromptu dinner doesn't automatically override ANY other previously scheduled plan, and especially not that one.

One of these days something terribly tragic will happen to you, and I hope it makes you realize how big of a narcissistic little dick you're being to your sister. I mean how does you getting a job even compare to your sister losing a husband? You're lucky she's even willing to forgive you and go out to eat with you. How would you feel if you had actually made plans in advance with your sister, then last minute she blew you off? Your sister was simply keeping her word to people who are important to her.

You have no right to tell anybody how to grieve or how long to grieve. Maybe she should have cancelled her plans, though it's very unclear what she had going on and that might have been as important to her as your celebration was for her. You are incredibly dismissive of her feelings and her loss, like she can turn it off whenever she wants. If she could, she would. Losing a spouse is fucking hard and you wanted her support but at the same time ignored any need she might have had for support.

But I do think it\u2019s extraordinarily mean to say that basically she needs to get over it it doesn\u2019t matter how long she was with him. Just be there for her if you can. This \u201csisterhood of the traveling pants\u201d or whatever kind of magic shit you\u2019re talking about is maybe working for you. But life just happens the way that it happens. And you feel what you feel and that is absolutely understandable. No one wants to feel shitty. Or maybe they do but I don\u2019t imagine that\u2019s what\u2019s happening in the situation. Don\u2019t you think she would be there if she could? A year is not very much time at all when we\u2019re talking about the sudden loss of somebody far too young to die.  The truth is bad things can and do happen. There\u2019s no amount of willpower that will keep bad things from happening. Nor good things actually. The only thing we can do is give kindness and love to the people who are around us who are going through something. Invite her to out to coffee. Find out how she\u2019s doing. Tell her you\u2019re so sorry she\u2019s going through this and tell her that you understand and that you\u2019ll be with her no matter how long it takes. If that\u2019s true, that is. Don\u2019t tell her that you\u2019re disappointed that she couldn\u2019t come out to celebrate for dinner. Don\u2019t tell her that she shouldn\u2019t be hanging out with her dead husband\u2018s family. They loved and miss him too. It\u2019s comforting to be around people who are grieving over the loss of somebody that means an extraordinary amount to them. No one wants to grieve. It\u2019s miserable. There is nothing to get over. You never stop missing people you lose. It does get easier. I do recognize that her life is literally different. It\u2019s a new life that now exist without a human that she loved in it and that human is never going to be here again. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s very proud of you. She\u2019s doing the best she can.

In order to remain anonymous, I'll simply say I've always dreamed of doing job X at company Y. My whole career has been based on getting this job and working for this company. So needless to say when I finally got an interview with company Y I was ecstatic. \n\nAfter a very lengthy interview process, I received a phone call yesterday letting me know that I had gotten the job. I was so excited. I immediately called my parents, who were so proud of me. My dad suggested that we go out for dinner to celebrate at our family's special occasion restaurant. They wanted to take me and my sister Megan (33F) out to celebrate the achievement. I was riding on cloud nine. \n\nI called my sister to tell her the news and the dinner plans. She congratulated me, but told me that she wouldn't be able to come. My mood immediately dropped, and I asked her why not. She told me that she had plans already with her (deceased) husband Miguel's family. \n\nI explained to her that this was a serious achievement that had taken a lifetime of work, and that I had finally achieved my dream. I told her that I needed her there to celebrate with me. She congratulated me again, but told me that this was a very important family celebration and she simply could not miss it. \n\nFor context: Megan and Miguel were married for a few months before he passed. It was really tragic, and she has my deepest sympathies. I understand how important he was to her, although I don't exactly agree with how she's handled his death. I understand her sorrow and sadness, but don't agree that she should be missing out on celebrating my achievements because her husband passed. She can (and does) mourn any other day of the year, but this is a once in a lifetime achievement. I got my dream job and she of all people should know how much that means to me.\n\nThis is the part where I may be a bit of an asshole. I called her out and said that missing out on her actual families celebrations to celebrate her husband's death with his family is a dick move. I told her that she couldn't spend the rest of her life obsessing over Miguel, and that at some point she needed to move on. Her obsession with him was ruining our relationship, and once again re-iterated that I needed her to be there with me tonight. \n\nShe actually laughed at me and said that \"of course she was obsessed with him\". She said a few other hurtful things, before\u00a0she hung up the phone. \n\nMy parents and I ended up going out for dinner just the three of us. Today my sister texted me and said we could go for dinner this weekend if I apologize for acting like such an ass. But I honestly don't think I should have to when she missed out on my thing. She also said some hurtful things, and doesn't seem to think she's in the wrong at all. So I want to know, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
