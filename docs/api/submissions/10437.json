Back when I was younger and all my friend group were in the still dating around phase of life I can\u2019t tell you how many times someone would say something like \u201cI am glad we broke up, the only bad part is now I won\u2019t go to do (insert concert, trip, special restaurant they had reservations for) and I was looking forward to that.\u201d", "NAH, took your sister.

Lol, she's completely delusional.", "NTA.\n\nThe most diplomatic thing to do, which you were under no obligation to do, would be to offer her the ticket at face value. Seating can be pretty fluid and both of you could probably have asked to move across the group beside you with little trouble. Again, no obligation though.\n\nEdit: oh wait hotel? Nevermind that's right out. Have a fun bonding time with your sister.", "No Hey-hey, No Tay-Tay", "NTA. She's probably just pissed because the tickets are hard to get but she's not entitled to them at all. It's sweet that you are bringing your little sister instead.", "NTA.\n\nPromises like this might as well have an unspoken clause that says \"as long as we are still dating\". \n\nIt was a planned couples trip. You aren't a couple anymore. Plans invalidated. Promises annulled. \n\nFrankly if she was so invested in seeing Taylor, I would have expected her to talk to you about the concert plans sometime soon after the breakup rather than just assuming it was still happening.", "YTA if your ex contributed financially to the trip/concert. Otherwise completely NTA. Your tickets your call.", "ESH\n\n\n\n You were NTA till you made it a point to say because you wouldn't be getting sex you weren't taking her....implying that the no sex was the deal breaker when she made it clear that you two go just as friends.", "INFO: was is a bday or Christmas gift? Or just a plan? If it\u2019s the latter you are fine. If it was gift and you broke up for good reasons, I\u2019m on her side or at least being able to buy the ticket from you", "This type of thing is a problem I\u2019ve seen a lot when people have an amicable breakup and decide to remain friends.", "She is very excited.", "I'm pretty sure I wasn't going to get any.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Like I said there were promises on both sides.

If she had paid half the room, and paid for her own ticket that's different. But if she only took the day off work go forth and enjoy that concert. You are 100% NTA.", "If he bought her a necklace for her birthday does he have the right for it back? Why is it different with a ticket?", "No Hey-hey, No Tay-Tay !!", "even if he didnt stated they wont go to the concert together he doesnt have to, its a separation. if he got to hold his end of a bargain she should hold her end too and he clearly say that promises were made on her side he wouldnt get. same situation so if he have to hold his end she should too.", "No, but it would be already with her. The tickets weren't. The tickets were for them to go together, not for her alone. A necklace would be a present for her alone, OP being with her or not wouldn't change that.", "Because he would have actually gave her the necklace and once it leaves your possession it belongs to that person", "Not the same at all. Sex can be revoked at ANYTIME. Men and women need to understand that that should always be okay.", "Again, what if she left the necklace at his house by accident. Does she not have a right to ask for it back? I\u2019d be more on your side if she cheated but it was mutual. If it was a planned trip just because then I agree with you. If it was gift, then a gift shouldnt be conditional. She should at least have the option to buy hers.", "that i know, i was just making a point that during a separation, any plans made before is void. just reimbursed any dept you may have and then just go. i was just making a point with the guy i responded too (was intended for the comment to be dumb)"]}
