I served 6 years before getting medically discharged.\u00a0 EX and i started dating. I got a good job that would have me leave a couple times a month up to 10 days at a time.\n\nWhile doing some last minute wedding planning a text from her sister\u00a0 poped up asking \"have you told [my name] about what you did with [her ex-boyfriend]. If you don't do it tonight I will tomorrow.\" I asked her what was that? She tried to play it off.\n\nI keept pressing her and said that during ther Bachelorette party she ran in to him but nothing happened. It was an obvious lie.\n\nI went through her phone when she fell asleep. There was text and pictures with him all the way back from when we started dating. They would hook up every time I went on work trips. Sent proof to my phone.\n\nI woke her up kicked her out and ended the relationship. She did the cheaters script. I told her \"Stephanie\" looked a lot like her ex bf and showed her one of the screen shots of them together in my bed. She started to cry and I gently got her our the door.\n\nI canceled all wedding plans and needed some help calling guest to inform them the wedding was off.\n\nMy friends wife said that during the Bachelorette party she caught them sneaking away and having intimate time. When she confronted them she gave my ex the option of coming clean to me herself or she would do it. She did not know it was an ongoing thing.\n\nNow on to the honeymoon vacation.\u00a0 I had planned it so that it would be perfect for my ex. It was 10 day trip to another country that she has always said was a \"once in a lifetime bucket list place.\" There was nice hotels amazing experiences and over all her dream vacation.\u00a0 I was already out about 10 grand for the wedding and more if I canceled the honeymoon trip.\n\nI made the decision to offer it up to them. Since I knew that they never had a honeymoon or really any real vacations since they got married young and had kids. Also they just saved me money and time. They accepted.\u00a0 They were able to get the time off work and had made arrangements for the kids for the trip.\n\nMy ex found out about it she flipped out and was calling me and texting me about how much of an AH I am for doing that to her. How I knew that it was HER dream vacation. How i ruined her life. I got messages from her friends and some of her family that she lied to and blaming me for the breakup. Her ex even texted me saying that im not a real man and then threatened me. She must have went there las night as he shouldn't have my number.I have not responded to them at all.\n\nBut AITA for giving my cheating ex fianc\u00e9e dream honeymoon to her sister and my best friend?", "Aww the post has been deleted ):", "I love you. thank you so much", "Post is gone, but the comments made me want to read it \ud83e\udd72", "tit for tay tay situation", "Actually she offered to buy it from him after they broke up.

I said he was a jerk for boiling her worth down (in these comments online) to whether she\u2019d sleep with him in the hotel room. I stand by that. Sorry! You aren\u2019t entitled to just say \u201cwell if she\u2019d sleep with me I\u2019d consider it\u201d and have that be not a gross thing.

You weren\u2019t the AH but you don\u2019t need to bring up sex that\u2019s weird.

She\u2019s an adult she can probably figure. That\u2019s not your issue though.", "I think his whole mentality around this trip is just a sex trip is gross.

I gave a judgement, if you want to be an AH you can.", "So because OP and his girlfriend view sex differently from you, he\u2019s wrong? Plenty of people view sex as transactional, there\u2019s an entire (perfectly valid) profession based on it. Everyone views sex differently and lots of people make plans to go away so they can fuck in hotels, men and women.

He could have given it as a gift on the day.

If a condition of receiving a necklace is that she has to give it back if they break up, those terms need to be set before giving.", "Yes I understand now he said the whole entire purpose of the trip was sex in another reply to me.", "He added an update:\n\n>Update: Funny thing about me is I can be in a war zone and be calm as can have a clam head.  But in the situation of that night I was a mess. I was noth thinking. When you get a bunch of messages telling me off from people I thought cared about me it threw me off.\n\n>On the bright side I get regular check ups because of my job. Blood work included. But I went and got checked specifically for anything sexual and all was negitive.\n\n>I followed some of the request and got a restraining order on the AP for the threat. Pays to have good connections with local Law Enforcement. \n\n>Yall were right. I didn't really have to do anything for the truth to come out. She ended up going to her sisters place the night after she found out about the honeymoon banging on the door demanding all the trip info. When she got denied she went crazy. Screaming and yelling and eventually detained when the neighbor call the cops. Found out that during her fit she confessed that she was just using me and never loved me and she admitted sleeping around behind my back.\n\n>Did I mention it was on camera (doorbell cam ftw). They posted it. I ended up getting messages from the family apologizing. But none from her friends so I sent them screen shots of the messages and a PG safe photo. Messages also included her talking crap about most of them.\n\n>After that the AP showed up to my house trying to break in and \"talk\" to me. He was drunk. I lightly self defensed him and \"carefully\" detained him. Police came and he was arrested. I also have cameras with audio. (Assault, attempted b and e, and for defying a RO)\n\n>So she lost most of her her family, friends, spent the night in jail and her AP is going to jail. \n\n>I was able to be set up on a contract for a month which comes with bonuses and getting out of the country. Hopefully my mind will be right when I get back. \n\n>Also my friend and his wife will be left today (Monday for the trip). I was able to get some of the more personal details of the trip changed in to their name. I also payed for the hotel to put a cheap camera and a note \"Remember to making lasting memories and document the journey.\"", "Whenever this happens just sort by \"Old\" and the first post will be where the AutoModerator made a complete copy of the original text.

Just not a good way to speak about other human beings especially ones you\u2019ve cared about. Very diminishing and sad. Your ex as a human is way more important than whether you\u2019d get any and if it\u2019s really not about sex why even emphasize it to anyone reading?

When you break up with someone, they're probably not gonna want to be \"nice\" to you anymore.", "> Still, I don\u2019t see why it would hurt to be nice.\n\nThis part of your comment doesn't pass the \"If you reverse the genders\"/\"If the situation was reversed\" check. Let's say OP was female and her ex was male. She promised her ex that they would go to a Weeknd concert or something, and he would get her a nice piece or jewellery or something that she likes. They break up and OP decides to take her younger brother. Her ex is mad about it because 'she promised'.\n\nWould you still hold a female OP to \"be nice\" to her male ex in this scenario?", "That\u2019s fine! But still, you\u2019re broken up, you don\u2019t want to go on this date \u2014 you say it\u2019s amicable \u2014 so why do you need to bring up in the comments that you aren\u2019t getting any as if \u2014 were she to offer you\u2019d have changed your mind? \n\nYou don\u2019t think she could\u2019ve booked a second hotel room if she \u201cbought the ticket off you\u201d as she said she would\u2019ve liked to? Why is the assumption she will come to this concert and stay with you (after the break up?) in the same hotel room? Again, the entire experience for you seems like it is revolving around the plan for sex when you are also saying in your post that she offered to go separately and buy the ticket off of you. She told you she feels this behavior is petty and maybe it is if the whole point for you is you won\u2019t be having sex that night. \n\nI\u2019m just telling you as a woman reading this comment I found it degrading and I\u2019m not even your ex. Other people are free to disagree and I have absolutely no issue with that. To each his or her own \u2014 as long as you and your partner are happy I don\u2019t judge! Here your ex-*partner says she feels this is petty and with the emphasis on sex I can\u2019t disagree \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t make you an asshole for not wanting to go with her, I cannot stress that enough.\n\nBut to me, it honestly honestly sounds like the sex was the most important part of the trip for you and that\u2019s why you can\u2019t give her the extra ticket (because for you the event was the hotel room whereas for her it sounds like it was the concert). I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s the way someone who truly amicably broke up with someone who they valued speaks about that individual and I would hold higher standards even for an ex.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve said my piece and I wish you and your ex the best! I hope you have an absolute blast with your sister and I do not judge you at all (despite the judgmental terms we use like \u201casshole\u201d on this sub). My only goal is to give you a different perspective on how this language is hurtful not just to the target but to others who read it. No more no less \u2014 not said with hate or judgement of you, just an opportunity to reflect on this type of language and valuation of partners. Good luck and genuinely genuinely wishing you the best!", "You should too.", "You\u2019re clearly illiterate because he said \u201c sex was the ENTiRE purpose of the trip\u201d.

Not everyone has a super shitty breakup. There is more than enough people who are still friendly with each other. Just because you don\u2019t work out as a couple it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t still respect someone as a person. You have a very sad view on relationships.", "She does not have the money.  She is on a tight budget.  For her to go there, get a room, and buy the ticket off me would cost her $1,000.  She does not have the money.", "I\u2019m getting downvoted for asking the exact same thing. I was so confused as to why he brought up sex at the end. It was all going really well for him. I dunno but it feels like he is weaponising the tickets. And he bought the tickets for her, new she wanted to go and instead of selling them, he goes with his sister. That\u2019s fine. His sister, It\u2019s likely she enjoyed. But then bringing up the \u201cpromise of sex\u201d is nasty to me.", "And you have clearly never had sex if you think that sex is not spending time with your significant other. If you are doing it right it can be a significant amount of time.

While the event is in the future, the minute he bought her ticket and said that it\u2019s for her, that\u2019s a \u201egift exchange\u201c to me. So while he obviously doesn\u2019t need to take her, that one ticket is hers.\n\nIf OP had given the ticket as a birthday present, would people be saying that you get to demand that present back?

I would be more sympathetic to your ex if she even thought to ask *before* this point, \"Hey, about those Swift tickets...\"\n\nIf she had offered to pay for one after you broke up, so she could still go, I would say negotiations are a good idea. She was planning to go with you, but you aren't together anymore.\n\nSure, it was supposed to be a gift for her. And she should be allowed to keep any gifts you gave her. Except you hadn't actually given her the tickets yet. They weren't in her possession. I think that any gifts you bought *for* her but still haven't actually delivered to her are still considered yours. And since you're not together anymore, you can decide to keep them and regift or use them however you want. \n\nNow, I'm just imagining her on the day of the planned trip, your ex- just showing up to your doorstep with her bags in hand, like, \"Come on OP, it's concert time!\"\n\nWhat did she actually expect? And why did she not communicate sooner?", "YTA \n\nshe was looking forward to go to this concert. She would have buy herself some ticket except you planned a trip with her and you bought her the tickets. Sorry but you should have sold them to her so she can go because she can\u2019t buy new tickets now. She would have buy them by herself months ago if she knew you would have break up before the show. She didn\u2019t plan of using you", "I disagree here. If she planned to go to this concert months ago and was ready to buy her own ticket at the time, she deserved to still go to the concert. If they planned the trip together because she wanted to go to the concert so he decided to offered her the places, he is an AH to not give her the opportunity to buy him her place so she can go. \n\nDoes that mean if you really want to go to a concert your partner can\u2019t invite you because if you broke up you can\u2019t go anymore ? So you have to buy everything by yourself and don\u2019t ask any gifts in case something happen to your relationship", "Not just a date but a very expensive one in a different city by the sound of it, with a hotel room lol.

Like \"Ok, I'll be by on Thursday to pick up my stuff, oh and also what are we going to do about the Taylor Swift concert?\"\n\nTaylor Swift tickets are notoriously impossible to get, so I understand GF's perspective of \"I didn't try other means of getting tickets because we made the plan to go together\". But that doesn't mean she's still entitled to go with him for free (like others have said, going with your ex on an overnight trip together sounds awful), but that she should have immediately tried coming up with an agreeable solution if she wanted \"custody\" of the tickets in the break up.", "Not this cowboy", "The problem is she really does not have the money.", "LoL", "I agree with the rest of what you said, but Taylor Swift\u2019s shows are very well known to be sold out everywhere, and resale tickets are going for $900+\u2026 and she only tours every few years, so let\u2019s not act like it will be easy for his ex to get her own ticket any time soon.", "She doesn't have the money.", "There was one where a woman wanted her ex to pay for her tickets to her home country (somewhere in Asia) from the US. After they had broken up.", "I thought not going to weddings of people you don't know was the silver lining to a break up...", "No, it means you had a life event that meant,because you let someone else buy your ticket and you are not longer with them, that you no longer have a ticket to go with. It is weird to me to break-up with someone and then expect to travel with them, sit next to them for an extended period and travel back together. \n\nIt is unfortunate but same risk as booking for any event - you might die, you might get ill, your car might breakdown, your relationship might break down. At least, she's not out of pocket on top of it. She could have offered to buy him out if not made assumptions but she expected her ex to pay for an expensive concert and trip. But the onus is on her to ask,not on him to offer.", "Actions have consequences, a breakup means losing access to resources provided by the partner such as housing, insurance, streaming services, phone plans... or in this case tickets and travel that were acquired with their money.", "I mean, she didn't say anything about it until the little sister brought it up, so it doesn't seem like it was on her mind at all. If she'd been 'planning for months' then that should have come to mind pretty quickly.", "No that would have been a dick move and you'd be back here asking AITA yelling at my gf for staying with me for an $$$ date lol", "Didn't she said she would have bought the ticket from you if you gave her that chance?", "How do you know that?", "I agree that she\u2019s not entitled to the ride and the hotel, bc you\u2019ll be using that yourself.\n\nMy opinion (take it or leave it) is that you should offer her the ticket, but stand firm that you are going to be using the hotel room. \n\nBtw how long of a drive is it that it seems to be such a big problem? Can she not just drive there herself of take a greyhound or something?", "in that case, flip 'em online and if she and a friend do really wanna go that badly they'll figure it out even with a markup", "Lol that\u2019s so similar to my experience. I ended up just blocking her after that, not worth the energy anymore.", "We had mutual friends attending the wedding but she wasn\u2019t friends with the bride or groom.", "So because you\u2019re not going to get any\u2026she can\u2019t see the concert. \n\nAnd y\u2019all are okay with such comments about women?", "> wrong but I don\u2019t see why you would mention you not getting sexy time.\n\nHe didn't mention it himself... Somebody else brought it up and he responded to it. \n\nAlso... 99% of couples are hoping for some good sex after a great night out. So  that's not very weird is it?\n\nAnyways... He's taking his sister now and guess what: also no sex!", "She did say that.", "Because I've lent her money to make rent?", "It's about three hours in the car.  She doesn't have a car.", "If he hasnt already given her said hypothetical necklace yes he's fine to still not give it to her.", "Well if her promise is no longer valid. Then that means his is void as well.", "I remember this one, lol the Ex sucked and OP did a great thing", "I knew there'd be someone that took a blatant piss take and decide to take issue with it. \ud83d\ude44\n\nShe doesn't get to see the concert because she doesn't have a ticket.  Her ex has tickets, he gets to see it, and he gets to see it with someone he wants to share the experience with, and that ain't her.", "The odds of me having sex with any of the people attending that concert is close to nil. They are still able to attend. So I don't get your point.", "get off the soapbox", "His sister had fun and that\u2019s what matters!", "This is what makes you the AH. Offer her the tickets at face value.", "I don\u2019t disagree. I agree in fact \ud83e\udd23", "No one is disputing that or disagreeing because that make sense. \n\nWhat doesn\u2019t make sense is to say \u201c I\u2019m pretty sure I wasn\u2019t going to get any(meaning sex)\u201d and you replied with \u201cand that\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t get to see the concert with you\u201d. So no sex\u2026no concert. \n\nThat\u2019s a very misogynistic comment to. That\u2019s not taking the blatant piss.", "But that\u2019s not the joke you made. \n\nOP said: pretty sure I wasn\u2019t gonna get any\n\nWe know he be meaning sex \n\nAnd you say: that\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t get to see tay\u201d\n\nMinimum is correct That\u2019s a disgusting comment to make.", "That\u2019s not what I said really. What I said was because you couldn\u2019t get any sex\u2026..of course she can\u2019t go!", "Okay good luck enforcing creepy agendas.", "Do you really think OP bought the tickets cause he's a giant Taylor fan?\nSex had everything to do with taking his gf to a Taylor swift concert", "And if she doesn't have the money?", "You aren't giving a judgment.  You are telling me how to spend my money.", "You literally didn't give a judgment lmao", "Wow, what a story.  Glad he's okay.  He's very generous to give the trip to her ex's sister and his best friend. Wow.....", "Hooooly shit! I hope it isn\u2019t a fake because this is the an extremely satisfying revenge story", "It won\u2019t let me sort the comments, do I have to be on the website?", "I\u2019m on mobile and don\u2019t have an \u201cold\u201d option, only \u201cnew\u201d.  So I do that and furiously scroll to the bottom \ud83e\udd72", "Chill please. You aren't the morality police. Obvious joke!!!", "Okay. Let me throw this out there.  Maybe you are from a different generation and don't know.  There is an app called tinder. When people from my generation use this app it is for sex a lot of the time. I have used this app that way.  If I went on the app and said that I was looking for a date for a Taylor Swift concert do you think it be would be difficult for me to find a sexual partner for the weekend? I've hooked up with women off there after coffee.", "And It is a creepy agenda.", "Which is what I\u2019m understanding now. \n\nAlso you are the first person to actually talk to me normally as opposed to insulting me and talking down at me whilst I asked question to try an understand. So I really appreciate that. \n\nI never KNEW people did things like that. Buying people items or stuff because they want sex. It\u2019s weird to me and that\u2019s ok.", "Eye think it\u2019s weird. And that\u2019s ok! You don\u2019t think it is. And that\u2019s ok!", "Have you even asked if she does? Maybe start there.", "Mine is the very top comment that started this whole conversation. In that top comment, I gave a judgement. Maybe read the thread before coming at someone the next time\u2026", "1. Nowhere does he say he is as only going to take her if she had sex with him, that\u2019s YOUR assumption. \n\n2. The whole point of the trip FOR BOTH OF THEM was to go to the concert, and fuck in a hotel. He just didn\u2019t care that much for the concert part. \n\n3. Many women enjoy sex. I can see that you have some hang ups about it, but many of us would have no problem taking a trip with the express intention of getting laid.", "Haha, yeah.  You do that scroll so fast you're not actually reading and hope you happen to catch the AutoMod header text?  I'm familiar. :)", "I just search the word \"bot\".", "The sort button on the app is (in my opinion) \"hidden.\"  On Android  it's at the top of the page you're viewing and has two horizontal lines where each line has a small circle at the end.  On the top line it's on the right and the bottom line is on the left.  Is that there for you?  Not sure what it looks like on iOS.", "Saying the reason why someone didn\u2019t go to a concert was because they didn\u2019t put out is not a joke. That\u2019s discussing.", "There\u2019s nothing funny about misogyny and people like you enable it with \u201cit\u2019s just a joke\u201d. \n\nYou don\u2019t get to tell me what what I can\u2019t and can\u2019t say. Do you see me censoring you? No.", "No I\u2019m just autistic. It takes me a while to understand scenarios like this and thanks for being patient. I assumed from your post that she was your girlfriend you said. Not just some girl you asked on tinder to hook up with for tickets. \n\nBut I have now learned that people buy other people things so they can get sex and that\u2019s normal to others.", "Wow you are insufferable.", "Bruh...", "Yes. Both of us live with roommates. Some of the things we enjoyed were things we would rather keep private. Hence the weekend away to see Taylor Swift and guilt free hotel sex.", "No worries thats why explained.\n\nHere's how the convo went:\n\nEx: do you want to go to the Taylor Swift concert?\nOp: No\nEx: what if I let you fuck me in _____\nOP: I've booked us a room at the Ritz", "Well she still owes me $700 I lent her to make her rent. Can we start there?", "No! I do what I want!", "No he said \u201cthe sole purpose of the trip was sex\u201d in a comment to me so therefore the only reason he is going is for\u2026sex. \nAlso bold of you to assume the ex wants her sex life discussed on Reddit and to find out that he said the sole purpose of him taking her to a trip was for sex. Which again\u2026he said!\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1173k8w/aita_for_not_my_ex_on_an_expensive_date_we_had/j99zi0w/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3  in \n\nthis comment OP (the link) Reveals he\u2019s pretty certain he wasn\u2019t going to get sex\u2026and that\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t get the tickets\u2026that\u2019s why he took his sister instead. Whilst I hope the sister enjoyed, his ex is right, it\u2019s slightly petty.", "It is thank you!! It must\u2019ve updated because I swear it was right above the comments", "Calm down dear. \ud83d\ude02", "Sigh.  Fine I'll spell it out for you.  My ex likes BDSM. She likes to be tied up and dominated.  We have stuff for that.  And we planned trips away from our roommates so they didn't have not hear us. The trip was to see Taylor Swift but also for a weekend of that.  Do you understand?", "So are you.", "Omg that\u2019s crazy \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI haven\u2019t seen this response in his comments and may have missed it. Can you link ? Or are you just trying to be funny \ud83d\ude04", "You keep adding on stuff to make yourself look good. You asked about the tickets. I said to ask if she can buy them off of you. If she owes you money for rent, than you need to have that discussion with her, not me.", "It\u2019s pretty different if the thing is something that has not been bought yet. If you specifically bought those tickets because you wanted to go together, I stand by what I said. Even if the \u201cgenders are reversed\u201d. Or if they both were men or women. Idc. \n\nNow the situation is different since OP would still have to spend time with them, which wasn\u2019t really disclosed in the post and changes the entire situation.", "Right. The purpose of the trip was the concert and sex, he just didn\u2019t care about the concert, she did. That doesn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t plan to have sex. Again, lots of people go away to get laid. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. \n\nIt\u2019s bold of you to suddenly have a problem with people discussing their and other peoples personal business on this sub. Or is it just when you don\u2019t like what they have to say? This sub is literally all about people disclosing personal information about them and others. Don\u2019t pretend like you\u2019re suddenly better than that. \n\nAnd so he knew that if he took her he wouldn\u2019t get laid? So? Once again, the point of the trip was the show and to fuck in a hotel. Now that they\u2019re broken up, that didn\u2019t happen. That\u2019s what break ups are. This way, he got the benefit of doing something nice for his sister. \n\nIt\u2019s not petty to not give someone hundreds of dollars of tickets (which OP also clearly stated she could not afford to pay for, not that he owed her the chance to try).", "Yeah, they changed it recently. I had to search for the sorting option too when I realized it wasn't right above thebcomments anymore.", "Agreed. On the app I swear it used to look just like the web-based version. Maybe I'm crazy? I mean, I am crazy, but I guess I thought I wasn't crazy about this one. \ud83e\udd23", "Okay mr Misogyny", "LMFAO - I can\u2019t believe these animals expect to have sex on romantic getaways! \ud83d\ude31 I\u2019m so shook right now!!! /s", "Sorry if I don't include everything. Here. The reason we were going to go away for sex is because she is into bondage and not a fan of having our roommates hear what we do.", "Also if she doesn't have money for rent how can she afford Taylor Swift tickets?", "I\u2019m bold to assume someone wouldn\u2019t want their sex life disclosed by someone else they no longer are in contact with ?"]}
