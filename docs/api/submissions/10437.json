Read\u00a0this\u00a0before\u00a0contacting the mod team\n\nI met my ex's sister in high school when she started dating my best friend.\u00a0 During our senior year she got pregnant and they married soon after.\n\nAfter high school I joined the military. I served 6 years before getting medically discharged.\u00a0 EX and i started dating. I got a good job that would have me leave a couple times a month up to 10 days at a time.\n\nWhile doing some last minute wedding planning a text from her sister\u00a0 poped up asking \"have you told [my name] about what you did with [her ex-boyfriend]. If you don't do it tonight I will tomorrow.\" I asked her what was that? She tried to play it off.\n\nI keept pressing her and said that during ther Bachelorette party she ran in to him but nothing happened. It was an obvious lie.\n\nI went through her phone when she fell asleep. There was text and pictures with him all the way back from when we started dating. They would hook up every time I went on work trips. Sent proof to my phone.\n\nI woke her up kicked her out and ended the relationship. She did the cheaters script. I told her \"Stephanie\" looked a lot like her ex bf and showed her one of the screen shots of them together in my bed. She started to cry and I gently got her our the door.\n\nI canceled all wedding plans and needed some help calling guest to inform them the wedding was off.\n\nMy friends wife said that during the Bachelorette party she caught them sneaking away and having intimate time. When she confronted them she gave my ex the option of coming clean to me herself or she would do it. She did not know it was an ongoing thing.\n\nNow on to the honeymoon vacation.\u00a0 I had planned it so that it would be perfect for my ex. It was 10 day trip to another country that she has always said was a \"once in a lifetime bucket list place.\" There was nice hotels amazing experiences and over all her dream vacation.\u00a0 I was already out about 10 grand for the wedding and more if I canceled the honeymoon trip.\n\nI made the decision to offer it up to them. Since I knew that they never had a honeymoon or really any real vacations since they got married young and had kids. Also they just saved me money and time. They accepted.\u00a0 They were able to get the time off work and had made arrangements for the kids for the trip.\n\nMy ex found out about it she flipped out and was calling me and texting me about how much of an AH I am for doing that to her. How I knew that it was HER dream vacation. How i ruined her life. I got messages from her friends and some of her family that she lied to and blaming me for the breakup. Her ex even texted me saying that im not a real man and then threatened me. She must have went there las night as he shouldn't have my number.I have not responded to them at all.\n\nBut AITA for giving my cheating ex fianc\u00e9e dream honeymoon to her sister and my best friend?", "Aww the post has been deleted ):", "I love you. thank you so much", "Post is gone, but the comments made me want to read it \ud83e\udd72", "tit for tay tay situation", "Actually she offered to buy it from him after they broke up. That\u2019s not using him for tickets.  He did buy the tickets for HER by the way.", "And did I say he was an asshole for not wanting to go with her? Nope! I said he was a jerk for boiling her worth down (in these comments online) to whether she\u2019d sleep with him in the hotel room. I stand by that. Sorry! You aren\u2019t entitled to just say \u201cwell if she\u2019d sleep with me I\u2019d consider it\u201d and have that be not a gross thing. Also notable you didn\u2019t deny that is how OP is coming across but instead justified it. Last I heard two wrongs don\u2019t make a right although two lefts might.", "I understand I just didn\u2019t see why sex was THE promise he brought up but I do now as he has let me know that sex was the entire purpose of the trip.", ">she promised to blow his mind\n\nHer expecting to still go after they broke up is pretty mind blowing.", "That\u2019s weird but ok.", "But why bring up sex? You weren\u2019t the AH but you don\u2019t need to bring up sex that\u2019s weird. Sex has nothing to do with you getting a ticket for your ex girlfriend and it has nothing to do with you going with your sister and you were absolutely in your right to take whomever you wanted. \n\nI hope you enjoyed.", "Idk? She\u2019s an adult she can probably figure. That\u2019s not your issue though.", "I think his whole mentality around this trip is just a sex trip is gross. Like, how does anyone think he\u2019s not the AH in this situation??", "Don\u2019t come in here asking for judgements to then be an AH to people who give you a judgement you don\u2019t like. I gave a judgement, if you want to be an AH you can.", "So because OP and his girlfriend view sex differently from you, he\u2019s wrong? Plenty of people view sex as transactional, there\u2019s an entire (perfectly valid) profession based on it. Everyone views sex differently and lots of people make plans to go away so they can fuck in hotels, men and women. Grow up prude.", "I don't know anyone who shares about doing this, but have seen the trope on the screen about getting kink sex on your birthday or xmas, so I suppose it could have been a specific \"I'll give you something you like just as much afterwards\" type of thing.", "Why would it be bought before? He could have given it as a gift on the day. When I gift a present like this, I tell the person on the day of celebration (bday/Christmas) and the event is later in the year.\n\n We also don\u2019t know it\u2019s a gift at all but if was given as a Christmas gift, he is taking back a gift. If a condition of receiving a necklace is that she has to give it back if they break up, those terms need to be set before giving.", "Yes I understand now he said the whole entire purpose of the trip was sex in another reply to me.", "He added an update:\n\n>Update: Funny thing about me is I can be in a war zone and be calm as can have a clam head.  But in the situation of that night I was a mess. I was noth thinking. When you get a bunch of messages telling me off from people I thought cared about me it threw me off.\n\n>On the bright side I get regular check ups because of my job. Blood work included. But I went and got checked specifically for anything sexual and all was negitive.\n\n>I followed some of the request and got a restraining order on the AP for the threat. Pays to have good connections with local Law Enforcement. \n\n>Yall were right. I didn't really have to do anything for the truth to come out. She ended up going to her sisters place the night after she found out about the honeymoon banging on the door demanding all the trip info. When she got denied she went crazy. Screaming and yelling and eventually detained when the neighbor call the cops. Found out that during her fit she confessed that she was just using me and never loved me and she admitted sleeping around behind my back.\n\n>Did I mention it was on camera (doorbell cam ftw). They posted it. I ended up getting messages from the family apologizing. But none from her friends so I sent them screen shots of the messages and a PG safe photo. Messages also included her talking crap about most of them.\n\n>After that the AP showed up to my house trying to break in and \"talk\" to me. He was drunk. I lightly self defensed him and \"carefully\" detained him. Police came and he was arrested. I also have cameras with audio. (Assault, attempted b and e, and for defying a RO)\n\n>So she lost most of her her family, friends, spent the night in jail and her AP is going to jail. \n\n>I was able to be set up on a contract for a month which comes with bonuses and getting out of the country. Hopefully my mind will be right when I get back. \n\n>Also my friend and his wife will be left today (Monday for the trip). I was able to get some of the more personal details of the trip changed in to their name. I also payed for the hotel to put a cheap camera and a note \"Remember to making lasting memories and document the journey.\"", "Whenever this happens just sort by \"Old\" and the first post will be where the AutoModerator made a complete copy of the original text.

Thanks!", "Ah I stand corrected on that.", "That is definitely how this comment came across. It\u2019s alright to have different intentions in your spirit and make that apparent in person, but you should be careful about the way you speak online. As a woman, if a man spoke this way about me in comments I\u2019d be very offended and hurt, so why do it now if your break up was truly amicable? Like I said you\u2019re absolutely not an asshole for not wanting to go on this date \u2014 but if a man was basically talking this way about your sister in the future online I\u2019d guarantee you\u2019d have an issue with it. Just not a good way to speak about other human beings especially ones you\u2019ve cared about. Very diminishing and sad. Your ex as a human is way more important than whether you\u2019d get any and if it\u2019s really not about sex why even emphasize it to anyone reading? Those kinds of terms are degrading to the importance of that kind of physical connection (and mind you I would have said the exact same if this were a woman talking about a man). Just think on the way you use your language.", "Did she really PROMISE him sex? Or was that just the idea in a normal couple to think about having sex after a night out.

Just because she said they would have sexy fun doesn\u2019t mean he is promised to it ? \n\n\u201cShe obviously no longer needs to fulfil her part\u201d her part of what? The deal? Why was it even a deal? I guarantee the girl didn\u2019t see it as that either. You don\u2019t think it\u2019s weird holding a promise of sex ? yall making sex sound like a contract. It\u2019s not?", "So that\u2019s my point I was trying to confirm\u2026..sex was the entire purpose of your trip ? Not spending time with your girlfriend. Not enjoying the moments with her. Sex?", "Well, very understandable you don\u2019t want to pay for her ride or accommodations. That\u2019s maybe a detail that the post needed though. Because her simply asking to buy the ticket off you is different from still expecting free rides and shelter.", "Nope it\u2019s not. And he also isn\u2019t legally required to do it. Still, I don\u2019t see why it would hurt to be nice. That said spending 3 entire days with his ex surely is too much.

Sex was very much the plan before we broke up.", "Please just log off for the day", "Christ are you a preteen child. YES sex was obviously part of the trip and guess what sex involves both of them so it is spending time as a couple, some pretty intimate time.", "Surprise! When you break up with someone, they're probably not gonna want to be \"nice\" to you anymore.", "> Still, I don\u2019t see why it would hurt to be nice.\n\nThis part of your comment doesn't pass the \"If you reverse the genders\"/\"If the situation was reversed\" check. Let's say OP was female and her ex was male. She promised her ex that they would go to a Weeknd concert or something, and he would get her a nice piece or jewellery or something that she likes. They break up and OP decides to take her younger brother. Her ex is mad about it because 'she promised'.\n\nWould you still hold a female OP to \"be nice\" to her male ex in this scenario?", "That\u2019s fine! But still, you\u2019re broken up, you don\u2019t want to go on this date \u2014 you say it\u2019s amicable \u2014 so why do you need to bring up in the comments that you aren\u2019t getting any as if \u2014 were she to offer you\u2019d have changed your mind? \n\nYou don\u2019t think she could\u2019ve booked a second hotel room if she \u201cbought the ticket off you\u201d as she said she would\u2019ve liked to? Why is the assumption she will come to this concert and stay with you (after the break up?) in the same hotel room? Again, the entire experience for you seems like it is revolving around the plan for sex when you are also saying in your post that she offered to go separately and buy the ticket off of you. She told you she feels this behavior is petty and maybe it is if the whole point for you is you won\u2019t be having sex that night. \n\nI\u2019m just telling you as a woman reading this comment I found it degrading and I\u2019m not even your ex. Other people are free to disagree and I have absolutely no issue with that. To each his or her own \u2014 as long as you and your partner are happy I don\u2019t judge! Here your ex-*partner says she feels this is petty and with the emphasis on sex I can\u2019t disagree \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t make you an asshole for not wanting to go with her, I cannot stress that enough.\n\nBut to me, it honestly honestly sounds like the sex was the most important part of the trip for you and that\u2019s why you can\u2019t give her the extra ticket (because for you the event was the hotel room whereas for her it sounds like it was the concert). I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s the way someone who truly amicably broke up with someone who they valued speaks about that individual and I would hold higher standards even for an ex.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve said my piece and I wish you and your ex the best! I hope you have an absolute blast with your sister and I do not judge you at all (despite the judgmental terms we use like \u201casshole\u201d on this sub). My only goal is to give you a different perspective on how this language is hurtful not just to the target but to others who read it. No more no less \u2014 not said with hate or judgement of you, just an opportunity to reflect on this type of language and valuation of partners. Good luck and genuinely genuinely wishing you the best!", "You should too.", "You\u2019re clearly illiterate because he said \u201c sex was the ENTiRE purpose of the trip\u201d. Not that it was \u201cpart of the trip\u201d. \n\nNot that he would have LIKED some fun, that SEX was the entire purpose of him taking her. I\u2019m going off his words not yours.", "Surprise! Not everyone has a super shitty breakup. There is more than enough people who are still friendly with each other. Just because you don\u2019t work out as a couple it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t still respect someone as a person. You have a very sad view on relationships.", "She does not have the money.  She is on a tight budget.  For her to go there, get a room, and buy the ticket off me would cost her $1,000.  She does not have the money.", "I\u2019m getting downvoted for asking the exact same thing. I was so confused as to why he brought up sex at the end. It was all going really well for him. I dunno but it feels like he is weaponising the tickets. And he bought the tickets for her, new she wanted to go and instead of selling them, he goes with his sister. That\u2019s fine. His sister, It\u2019s likely she enjoyed. But then bringing up the \u201cpromise of sex\u201d is nasty to me.", "And you have clearly never had sex if you think that sex is not spending time with your significant other. If you are doing it right it can be a significant amount of time. I also read what he wrote and by the time he said that he was exasperated by your inability to comprehend that sex was a key part of the trip but not literally the point for the whole trip otherwise there would be no concert."]}
