{"id": 19188, "submission_id": "142vb0p", "title": "UPDATE : AITA for telling to my SIL why I've missed her wedding ceremony", "selftext": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11p76j1/aita\\_for\\_telling\\_to\\_my\\_sil\\_why\\_ive\\_missed\\_her/  \n4-5 days after the wedding and the Reddit post; after all of those comments and reflexions: I\u2019ve texted my SIL.  \nI said that I was sorry that everything happened the way it did. But I was not wrong to told her the truth, and this whole situation could have been very dangerous. I did my part with asking her about the allergies and even with that, a reaction happened.  \nBut I do feel sad that she passed a bad night indirectly because of me.  \nVictoria called me after my text and said she understood my situation and the fact it could have been very dangerous. She assured me she called and emailed the caterer informing them of all the allergies and food requirements. She said then that a part of her is mad at me because she thinks I should have told her the next day, but it\u2019s on her to work on that and to process those feelings.  \nWhen she came back from her honeymoon, we investigated about this. After many calls, we found the problem. The caterer has 2 sub-teams. The main one (supper) was the one Victoria informed about the food requirements. It was their responsibility to inform the \u201cmorning team\u201d about it. (It\u2019s actually impossible to contact the morning team directly, all the administration is on the main/supper team). One of the workers of the morning team sends us their email stating all the food requirements and surprise surprise, the coconut was absent. So the lady in the Main team whom Victoria was working with mis-wrote the email and forgot to state about the coconut to the morning team.  \nPlus, coconut is not considered a common allergen so it is rarely written on the menue pamphlet.  \nThe catering, to excuse themselves, reimburse the whole bill for the morning and supper. It was a very fancy catering business, so the bill was quite high. They even gave additional sum (for me) at the condition we don\u2019t sue.  \nVictoria left me with the choice. And I chose to take the money. I know there is a possibility to get more if we sued, but in the end, no one died and I didn\u2019t want to go trough a whole suing process. Plus, this whole situation could have been avoided if I went to the chef beforehand, so in court that would have played against us.  \nMy bother and Vic did a whole post on their wedding Facebook group about this situation. They said that the incident was not their fault, nor mine, but the catering business who took responsibility for their action. After it, many of the family members who wrote me insults excuse themselves about their comments. My brother is still bitter about this situation and still think I could have simply waited a day before telling the bride about the incident. But Vic and I are closer now than we were.  \nSo this is a happy ending. And I can only wish the catering will learn they lesson and create a better system for allergies. And for now, I will always double check with the catering business on next weddings!", "created_utc": 1686090266, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/142vb0p/update_aita_for_telling_to_my_sil_why_ive_missed/", "score": 171, "replies": ["As many people have pointed out in the original post, your brother needs to be thankful that his wedding didn't end with a funeral. Vic sounds way more mature than him. I'm sure you know that some forms of allergy can lead to an intensifying reaction with every exposure to the allergens. I'm also guessing you were on the toilet alone, and could have dehydrated and gone into cardiac arrest from lack of electrolytes with no one around to help. Your brother needs to get over himself and appreciate still having a sister.", "It's wild to me that Vic was more concerned about you and understood her feelings were irrational more than your own brother, but I'm glad you both got to the bottom of it and got repayed for your troubles!", ">Plus, coconut is not considered a common allergen so it is rarely written on the menue pamphlet.\n\n  \nThis is actually really surprising to me, because growing up a coconut allergy on TV was literally how I learned that food allergies were a thing (I think it was an episode of Wishbone?)", "Glad it was resolved and you and Vic are still close.  \n\nTomato and orange both have the same effect on me as coconut does to you - not pleasant, and means bland porridge for a couple of days to let the stomach settle.  I have had \"discussions\" with catering people before because when I check they look at the allergen list and say \"oh it's not on there so it is safe\".   NOOO!!!  it is not on the common allergen list but it makes me ill.", "Right, it sure sounds like everyone else involved here has a whole lot of misplaced anger at themselves for not giving more of a crap about OP.", "Omg I remember wishbone!! Miss that little pup.", "Literally what I was thinking too! The character of Sam mentioned in the Food Bank/Robin Hood episode about her coconut allergy when talking about the lunch lady who was donating leftover food to the local food bank against her tyrannical supervisor's wishes.", "That was a good little doggo", "What's the story Wishbone!", "NTA.  I am glad you and Vic made up and agreed about a path forward.  I am glad you kind of passed it ok but yeah hopefully now you have learned to always always double check things at the time with the wait staff (and make sure they definitely talk to the chef in the kitchen!) about your allergens.  I have a friend with a lot of unusual allergies and she always does this and it is terrifying and she always read menus AND askes the waitstaff AND checks her food before eating.  I wish you good  health and your friend/SIL and brother a good and healthy life together!", "Your brother sounds like an ass. Vic seems to care more about you than your brother does.", "Wow, that's great!", "I think it might be regional, some common allergy in one country, is less common in another country."]}
