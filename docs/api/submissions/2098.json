My wife and I spend almost no time apart at the moment as our son is struggling with bedtime routines and it takes her feeding then me singing a song to get him to sleep.

If he wakes up he will not go back in the cot for his mum but will for me. \n\nI have the most incredible relationship with my wife.

Which was met with anger and \"well if he wakes up early you can look after him.\" Followed by a bit of \"How long are you going to be then?\" And \"Well I probably won't sleep until you're in bed so that means we both have a late night\". We ended up having a small argument about how we both need sleep but I want to forgo 45 minutes max to watch something for myself. \n\nI get her side of it, if she doesn't sleep when I'm not in bed with her right now then she won't be sleeping but if we both go to bed now she'll sleep and I'll be forced to listen to something as the light from my phone is \"too bright\" and keeps her awake. \n\nSo my only idea is to watch my programme downstairs whilst she goes upstairs. \n\nWe're both tired and mentally drained, but I just really want some time to myself right now which I feel like I just don't get...", "created_utc": 1668208043, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ysq3au/aita_for_wanting_37_minutes_on_my_own/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're already in charge of putting your son to bed.  You can't be in charge of putting your wife to bed, too, it's just too much to ask of someone who is already exhausted.", "NTA. get your wife a body pillow or a weighted blanket to ease the feeling of you not being next to her but honestly, everyone needs and deserves time to unwind the way they see fit.", "NAH\n\nFellow tired parent here: sometimes it doesn't matter how tired you are, you just want some time and some space to be you, be alone, not be touched, and enjoy something that helps you recharge.  These moments don't frequently present themselves so you have to take them as they come.  \n\nIt sounds like your wife is also tired and burnt out.  You both deserve a break and since you're doing the heavy midnight lifting you get your time first, then tomorrow you can go to bed early together and get some extra sleep.", "NTA. People need time to themselves to decompress.", "NTA. Go sciencey with the explanation. Needing space is necessary human behavioural self-care. She on the other hand is exhibiting subtle co-dependent behaviour, so I\u2019d encourage you to help her find \u201cthe thing\u201d for herself to retreat into every once and awhile. This is healthy for your both.", "Going with NAH. You're both exhausted and caring for an infant, so yeah, the time demands and sacrifices are the priority for their well being.\n\nAnd especially you both need to get to sleep on a mutual schedule for rest. If it's a streaming show or something that can recorded, don't procrastinate going to bed.\n\nI get the frustration, but you bear equal responsibility and work, \"Dad\"", "NTA - Everyone needs time alone to decompress. It\u2019s okay for you to have time for yourself. It\u2019s not something you should feel guilty or selfish over. It\u2019s not a *want,* it\u2019s a *need.* If you don\u2019t feel guilty for eating when you\u2019re starving or breathing when you\u2019re suffocating, then don\u2019t feel guilty for getting alone time when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed.\n\nI liked someone\u2019s suggestion of a body pillow or weighted blanket if your wife is having trouble sleeping without you there. Music or a noise machine at a low volume might help her as well.", "NAH. From your description you're both stretched pretty thin and in need of some r&r. Maybe her overreaction has to do with something completely different, like a fear of losing you because life is so stressful at the moment. Even if it's completely irrational. Maybe your request came off as rude or there was a real or imaginary tone. Your request is valid, you are allowed some me time. Has your wife had some me time recently? Maybe that triggered her. \n\nAny way the grandparents can look after the little one for a day and you guys sleep in and do something nice together?\n\nAlso deep breath, this too shall pass in a couple of months.", "NTA that\u2019s reasonable. I don\u2019t see why she thinks it\u2019s appropriate to \u201cpunish\u201d you with the early shift but if you are in fact keeping her up I get that too. \n\nEveryone needs their rest - rest isn\u2019t always sleep, sometimes it\u2019s an episode alone.", "The only problem I see is not that she might not fall asleep without you there, but how would you manage not to wake her up getting into bed? Especially if it takes her a little time to fall asleep", "She can sleep with a body pillow and cover her eyes if she 'MUST HAVE' you next to her to sleep.  I call BS on that though. Does she never sleep if either of you are travelling for work or visiting friends/family? I think this is a controlling and/or co-dependent move.\n\nIf all else fails, learn to enjoy a bath, or suddenly develop a pooping schedule that, gee o gee, 'requires' you to hole up in a bathroom for an episode. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nAlthough is there a reason she can\u2019t sleep while you are not in bed?", "NTA", "NTA You\u2019re allowed time to yourself just like she is. Ask her if she has any time she wants to herself this could just be frustration at seeing someone else get free time while she feels trapped with none. Also, it\u2019s really unhealthy your wife can\u2019t sleep without you beside her I would have a GENTLE convo about how that is too much pressure and responsibility to put on any one person.", "NTA your wife sounds codependent on you though \n\nlike geez you already have a child to put to sleep now a full grown ass adult? sounds exhausting!! \n\nlike for your son, she needs to establish her own sleep routine and not depend on you \n\nchildren tend to gravitate towards the more consistent parent as well so i can see why he\u2019s having more issues with her than you", "Cut your wife some slack on this. She's exhausted, too. I say have a talk with her earlier in the day sometime about needing some alone time to watch a show for a bit. Recognize that she needs to find some time for herself as well. I have a friend who traded half-days with his wife and it really worked for them. She took Saturday mornings to do what she liked to do while he took care of the kids and then the roles were reversed for a few hours in the afternoon. Maybe bedtime isn't going to work for you but another creative arrangement like the one I mentioned might.", "NAH. You guys are just tired and overwhelmed and cranky.

I think it's because we have no time to be us anymore.  You wake up and are \"Parent\", go to work and are. \"Employee\", get home and are \"Parent/Partner\" the bed and doing it again.

I saw a post on ig that called it \u201crevenge bedtime procrastination\u201d. Basically that you don\u2019t have your daytime to yourself so you value the freedom from responsibility in the late night hrs. Once I thought of it like that, it helped me to focus on valuing the daytime more and not staying up so late. Setting time limits on iPhone helps too.

I have two kids, and I just need some quiet time to myself. No touching. NAH, though. Communicate, gently and not in the heat of the moment.", "I got a weighted blanket because it sounded amazing. I like a cool room but being warm and toasty within it. And it *was* amazing -- for about an hour. Then I was too hot. It's not large enough to be the only blanket (plus sheet, of course) but even with a lightweight cover it was just too hot. \n\nI found a good use for it though. It's folded in quarters at the foot of my bed and my dogs (small 16 pound-ers) apparently feel like royalty when then sleep on it."]}
