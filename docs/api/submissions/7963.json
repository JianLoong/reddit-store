He honestly sounds like a gold digger. Even the kids. I hope she has a solid prenup.", "NTA tell your mom. It\u2019s one thing for them to ask but to then insult you and try and bully you into agreeing is too far. Their father needs to deal with them. It sounds like youre not very close to them and you probably won\u2019t be if this is their mind set. Also your mom should know that they wanted you to test her. It sounds like they may sabotage your party as they are upset. Your mom sounds smart and sure of herself so give her the information and let her do what she wants", "NTA\n\nTELL HER NOW!  I suspected that your step dad may have a hand in it as well so the girls can pressure you into convincing your mom.  Stand firm and say NO.  Please update us if you can because I'm curious to see what your mom says.", "NTA.\n\nAnd your mom's boyfriend and his whelps are trash, hoping your mom notices quickly before they screw her over.", "NTA. Good on you and your mom for retaining boundaries and loyalty!", "ESH except Myla.\n\nYou didn't have to share your actual birthday with her; but couldn't you have pushed your mom and Jay to do something on a different day for her birthday?\n\nAlso, I don't care what your culture is or how rich you guys are, 60k on a birthday is ridiculous.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nHer mom already said no, so the daughters were sent to bully her?\n\nDefinitely tell your mom. She should know what kind of person she married and the kind of children he is raising.", "If he wants to share, he should pay you $30K for splitting your party. He's just cheap and selfish and hoped he could force you or your mother to make you share. This would be a divorce-worthy manipulation. NTA", "Jay wants to sponge off your mom.", "I think asking if he is ready to pay his share is ok. However even so, it would also be ok for OP's mother to refuse.\nBut asking while not wanting to pay his share is... beyond words", "Yes, I missed that since the step siblings didn't live with OP after her mother and step-dad got married.  But still, step-dad knew his daughter's birthday was coming up. Sounds like he hoped that he could just hijack Op's party so he didn't bother to plan one  for his daughter."]}
