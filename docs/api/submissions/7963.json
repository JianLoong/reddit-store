In my culture, it's called a Debut and is equivalent to quince or sweet16.

Jay have a son and 3 daughters with his first wife. They didn't moved in together entirely after the wedding but he would sleep at our place when my mom isn't traveling. His youngest daughter, Myla (fake name) will also be turning 18 a few days before me, however, he didn't plan anything for her bday.\n\nOver Christmas dinner, the topic of our bdays came up and my mom said that she doesn't have to worry about mine anymore because she planned it way in advance. Jay tried to get more info but she chuckled and told him \"I planned it way before we got married.\" She thought that was the end of the it but few days later, my mom told me that he asked her if me and his daughter could share the day since our birthdays aren't that far apart. My mom said no, and that it will be inappropriate since our family and friends living abroad will be flying in just for the event and she wants the day to be just all about me. She instead offered to help him and connect him to her events coordinator so he could start planning for his daughter's party within his budget even on such short notice but he refused and said he's not wasting money for such lavishness. My mom stood her ground and told him that her offer stands but she will not change her mind on not sharing my day.\n\nOh well, stepsiblings came over yesterday to enjoy the amenities in our apartment building and for barbecue when they saw the invitations and stationeries on the table as I was sorting them out when they arrived (mom, Jay, and stepbro were already at the pool by this time.) Myla broke down in tears and begged me to convince my mom to let her share my party with her since we are basically sisters now. I said \"I'm sorry, but I am not the one making plans nor it is my money being spent on it so it's not up to me.\" Her older sisters backed her up and they even suggested that I test my mom by telling her that I wouldn't show up to my party if I couldn't share it with Myla, so I told them that they obviously do not know my mom and that she isn't the type to test. All 3 of them then berated me and called me stupid and selfish brat for not understanding that family should share and I'm a coward weakling because I can't stand up to my mom. I was shocked so I just walked out and stayed away from them the rest of the day. I still feel shaken by this and knowing my mom, she will bring hell fire on them even if it cost her her marriage if I tell her, so I don't know if I should tell her.
