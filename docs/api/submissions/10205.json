Ok \n\nHe pushed back. Like. A lot. That\u2019s the jerky move.", "It\u2019s not a jerk move to assume, but upon hearing your partner say it\u2019s a special food item they love and want to split evenly anybody reasonable would say \u201c ohhh, okay \u201c and not make a fuss.", "It\u2019s not a jerk move to assume, but upon hearing your partner say it\u2019s a special food item they love and want to split evenly anybody reasonable would say \u201c ohhh, okay \u201c and not make a fuss.", "Yes, agreed. I just don't think he was wrong in his initial assumption that this meal would be split as they always are.", "OP in fact never specifies what the split was any thing they had had that previously.\n\nOther than that, yeah I agree.", "Yes agreed.", "It\u2019s not in the post, it\u2019s in the comments. Apparently they usually have it as a snack and they split it evenly.", "Hmm okay then.  I still don't think he's a jerk for assuming this full meal would be split how they always split their meals. He is a jerk and an asshole for not being okay with it, though.", "op=NTA\n\nthe problem here is if he was still hungry, he should be making more food.\n\nTO be honest, since you had a stressful day, he should have been offering to take out food to make(himself) or order something instead of hogging your special treat.\n\nI get that this isn't a major thing, but it's small things like little slivers that grow bigger with time, he needs to respect your NO instead of guilting you into giving way.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. And technically they are YOURS bc you get them so he doesn\u2019t have the right to decide how theyre split. \n\nAlso googling recipe for this now lol", "NTA. Entitled boyfriend. Doesn\u2019t understand sharing. He probably is the only child.", "NTA - I am hungry just reading this", "NTA... you give up too early. If he was still hungry after dinner, he can have some toast or cereal.  He is being selfish and doesnt see it and that is why it ultimately bothers you. Look for the other ways this behavior trait shows up in your relationship. Is it his comforts first? When choosing tv show, bedroom temperature... little things can reveal what big things will look like.", "Psst, Hubigs pies are back and you can order lemon and apple online", "As someone who lives in SAT, I can concur on this statement (There is one 10 mins from me.. hubby and I are regulars). Also......on a side note, you should definitely try \"Delia's Tamales\" originally from the RGV (Rio Grande Valley), they just added a location in SA off the loop about 2 years ago. Highly HIGHLY RECOMMEND :)", "Well I decided to order some, so thanks for the link!", "You can buy collapsible coolers for about $15 online. They would fit in your suitcase on the way down & then, if you fly an airline that doesn't charge for carry on bags, no charge to bring it back with you. Just FYI. I did this last year with all the chocolate we bought in Canada. \n\nAlso, you are NTA for wanting 3 of the balls for yourself!! Why are you doing all the cooking? If your fiance needs more food, why can't he make himself some extra? Why is it on you to always make more for him?", "Out of curiosity, have you tried Cajun places in Seattle and not found them up to par? e.g. What about a place like this: Altha\u2019s Cajun Grocery? Asking because then I won't bother searching because I'm really curious to try those boudin balls but don't want bad ones.\n\nAlso, NTA. Those are your special treats, you get half. Hell, you'd be generous if he only got a couple."]}
