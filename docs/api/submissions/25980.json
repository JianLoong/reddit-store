I do hope you tell *somebody* where you will be and when you expect to return, just in case something happens. If you have an incident and no cell coverage, it might be nice to have somebody know where to come looking for you, wouldn\u2019t it?\n\nAnd you might think about getting a satellite phone.

Maybe it'll help if you give her the specific time you expect to be done?\n\nYou could also record one of your hikes on a Go-Pro to show her what it entails.", "NTA, but it is a bit of a safety issue. Can you do something else to reassure her about your safety? Better phone? Pre-planned route? Prioritize finding a friend to walk with? \n\nBut your last line is a little concerning. Her worrying about your safety sounds reasonable, but her thinking you're doing something sketchy does not.", "NTA, it is entirely reasonable to want time to yourself and to appreciate the beautiful areas around you. As a hardcore introvert, I understand that it's really important to get some alone time to recharge no matter how much you love your partner. \n\nFrom a practical perspective, something you could do as a compromise is purchase a device like a Zoleo or Garmin InReach that allows for text messaging via satellite when you're not in cell range. It's a bit of an investment for the device, but the monthly plans for casual users are very reasonably priced. I did this to address my partner's concerns with me being out of cell range, which were mostly safety related. Initially I was concerned that it would lead to a lot of messaging while I was in my decompression space, but just knowing that they could contact me turned out to be all that was needed. \n\nMaybe suggest this to your girlfriend and see how she reacts. If it doesn't seem like enough there may be some deeper underlying codependency issues to address.", "Nta. It's important to have separate interests you engage in without the other. \n\nToo much time together isn't healthy and will lead to resentment. \n\nThere's no ethics to it, rural areas have bad reception/cell service, and its reasonable to expect to be out of contact during that time. \n\nThis is a bit of a red flag, to me at least, but I value time to myself quite highly.", "NTA but you\u2019d probably be happier with a less clingy girlfriend, this girl is unlikely to change.", "NTA. Remember like 10 days ago when there were no cell phones and this was the normal 24/7 experience of knowing someone? Up until fairly recently anyone who left your sight might as well be vanished from the face of the earth but now we all need constant contact", "NTA. Everyone needs space to themselves at times; once weekly isn't unreasonable. She should realize that clingy isn't a good look...or good for relationships.", "NTA. \u201cSecretive and sketchy\u201d suggests she\u2019s worried you\u2019re leaving information out or lying to her about your whereabouts rather than being concerned for your safety.\n\nI agree with other redditors that this is a potential red flag. \u201cPotential\u201d based on the post, because we only know so much. Whether or not it is in line with other worrying traits and actions is something you\u2019ll have to consider on your own.\n\nThe only thing I can think of that might be reasonable from her POV is the consistent once-a-week schedule. On one hand, it\u2019s not uncommon for people to schedule stuff like this routinely. On the other hand, it\u2019s also not uncommon for people to feel suspicious of such routines (\u201cA full day every single week? Is there someone else?\u201d). \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to suggest except for encouraging her to broaden her view. She\u2019s hyperfocusing on this specific routine of yours. If you are able to get her to admit exactly what she means by \u201csketchy\u201d (don\u2019t assume, even if it seems obvious, because she may retaliate with \u201cI didn\u2019t say that and you\u2019re putting words in my mouth\u201d), ask her to consider not just this routine but how your relationship has generally been. Is it fair of her to suspect something is amiss? Do your other actions line up with it? Is it a logical assumption, or more of a wild one? \n\nIf she refuses to consider the above, you should bring up your own concerns wrt the way she\u2019s acting. All the best OP!", "INFO: Do you work 5 days a week and then go off-grid for 1 of your 2 days off? \n\nNot sure if she's mostly concerned about safety, or about the fact that you are using 50% of your leisure days away from her.", "NTA. You need downtime from a relationship, it's healthy to have \"me time\". It's selfish of her to expect you to cater to her 24/7. You are being fair saying where you are going and when you think you will be back. Am I just a weirdo? My husband has gone on a few camping trips with his friends, and I didn't demand to attend and chaperone him. He is an adult, and can do that ngs with his friends.
