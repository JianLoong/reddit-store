I went through the same thing when my brother got divorced and his wife still wanted to be \"sisters\" with me and my sisters.

My SIL used to always text me when she waa mad at my brother. That was the majority of the time I heard from her. When they were married I tolerated it because I wanted to make his life a little easier abd she was so unstable I knew she would take anger at me out on him. Once she found out I knew how unstable she was and they started the process of getting divorced, I started getting texts about all his faults including his lack of bedroom skills so I told her I no longer needed to deal with this and blocked her.

I knew when I walked out the door that I was leaving their family for good (we had no children together) and that was that. Painful, sure.
