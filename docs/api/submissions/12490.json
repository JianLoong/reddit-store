I\u2019m Asian, and the diversity here is close to zero. I\u2019ve been good friends with my roommate, Jenny, ever since high school. A group of guys lived across from our dorm suite, and Jenny was the one to introduce the both of us to them. I don\u2019t like them as much as Jenny does, but we get along fine. \n\nWe started hanging out with the guys a bit more often as the semesters passed, and Jenny told me she liked one of the guys, James. Three days ago, me, Jenny, James, and two other guys decided to grab food at the dining hall. Then James, out of nowhere, said some things along the lines of \u201cI love Asians\u201d, \u201cAsians are so obedient\u201d, and \u201cYou can be my whore.\u201d Obviously, I got pissed. I just stood up and walked back to my dorm. I remember Jenny not saying anything to defend me. Later, she came back and told me she \u201cscolded\u201d the guys and told them what they said was pretty racist. She then promised that she\u2019s going to avoid them from then on. I was genuinely happy to think that she would defend me like this, since she was better friends with them than I was. \n\nWhen I came back to the dorms at around 10PM yesterday, I heard voices coming from the guys\u2019 room. I normally wouldn\u2019t give half a shit, but then I heard Jenny\u2019s loud voice. She spent about another hour there before entering our room. She seemed surprised to see me. When I asked her where she was, she seemed hesitant to reply, so I said I know that she\u2019s been going behind my back to fuck around with the guys. She rolled her eyes and gave me some half-assed response about how they were \u201cfunny\u201d and \u201cgood people\u201d. She told me she\u2019s been in their room whenever I\u2019m not around and it\u2019s not a big deal, even after she promised to avoid them. I then brought up what happened in the dining hall. Her response? \n\n\u201cYou should consider yourself lucky that James finds you hot. You people (Asians) have it so much easier. You don\u2019t understand how hard I had to try to make him like me.\u201d\n\nI exploded, and told her she needs to shut up and get a reality check. James does not like her, he is a racist piece of shit and she\u2019s an attention seeking whore for continuing to hang out with them after she told me she wouldn\u2019t. She then got teary eyed and stormed out of the room. \n\nI have no idea where Jenny went or what she\u2019s doing. It\u2019s been a day I still haven\u2019t seen her. When I saw James today, he glared at me and mumbled \u201cbitch\u201d under his breath as he walked by me. One of Jenny\u2019s friends spammed my instagram DMs calling me all types of degrading things, and said I better apologize or it\u2019s \u201con sight\u201d (I kinda scoffed at that). However, no matter what Jenny did, I still feel guilty about what I said. Calling someone a whore is just out of line and mean spirited, and I\u2019ve been good friends with her for over 3 years. I feel like I should apologize ASAP, but I feel like I need opinions from others before I do so. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679025439, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11tge4r/aita_for_calling_my_roommate_an_attention_seeking/", "score": 152, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You feel bad because you\u2019re a good person. She feels justified in her actions because she is not. NTA.

Keep standing up for yourself.", "NTA. The slur could have been avoided and if you want then you can apologise for that. But the rest of it was true. This is attention seeking behaviour. This is not how friends treat each other. That guy is racist and for Jenny to defend him makes her terrible too. \n\n>\u201cYou should consider yourself lucky that James finds you hot. You people (Asians) have it so much easier. You don\u2019t understand how hard I had to try to make him like me.\u201d\n\nLike wth?

If she wanted to be a hypocrite, you don\u2019t have a say in the matter, let her be one. \n\nThat being said, her comments and the other guys extremely gross, fetishizing and cringeworthy comments paint a very clear picture of their characters, perception of you, and it\u2019s honestly a really good thing that you don\u2019t talk to them at all anymore. I don\u2019t know whether to full-body cringe at Mr. \u201cI think calling a women obedient based on race is a compliment\u201d or full-body cringe at Jenny saying \u201cyou people\u201d.", "NTA , you\u2019ve been friends for 3 years she literally promised not to hang out with them, her comment about you being lucky kind of suggests she\u2019s jealous by the comment because the guy she wants potentially would want you and she\u2019s happy to hang around him now that you\u2019re not there.  That is a shitty friend", "Let's see. You have had racist and sexist comments thrown at you and you have been threatened and harassed. Your \"friend\" and I put this in quotation marks because she is not your friend or at least not a very good one is exactly what you called her.  If she was truly on your side, she would have made James apologize to you and facilitated a reconciliation. But because she now knows James thinks you are hot, she sneaks around to be with him while keeping you in the dark. I think you need to speak to your RA or even the someone in student services. You cannot fix this. You need to look out for yourself and have someone put those harassing you on notice that their behavior will not be tolerated. NTA.", "Just tell her that you apologize for calling her a whore but you don't want to be friends with someone who is racist against you.", "I truly want to say NTA but i am on the fence. Racism is in my opinion way worse than calling someone a whore. The way that she said \u201cyou people\u201d kind of makes me feel as though she has some racism in her as well and needs to learn how to not be racist. Fetishization of a certain race has been a problem for YEARS and you\u2019ve been dealing with racism your whole life. She knows nothing about how you would feel in that situation assuming that shes white. And claiming she has it \u201cso hard\u201d because people dont fetishize her race is annoying at best.\n\nEdit to add my final vote: NTA. Shes definitely racist even if you havent seen it before.", "I think you're right to feel bad for losing your temper and behaving as badly as she has been, but I do understand that you're a human being, and we can only be pushed so far.\n\nI'm sorry your friend did this to you.  She's boy crazy, some girls are, and they can't see what they're doing is wrong because they just need that male validation so much more than anything else.  It's sad, at least you found out who she really is.\n\nI would just apologize for saying what you said, and then let the friendship die completely.  You don't necessarily have to block her, but you also don't have to interact with her beyond civility anymore.  You can't trust her, she doesn't have your back, so wash your hands of her, wish her good luck, she's gonna need it more than you.  \n\nYou seem like a very mature and together young woman, and I just hope you learn from this experience, take that from it, and leave the rest alone.  You're better than that nonsense, anyhow.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I dont think she is your friend. If someone insults my friend, they have insulted me. Also James is a racist.  Jenny is a racist too.", "NTA. Report them. This girl is  jealous of the attention (however negative) you're getting from her crush, but I guess some attention is better than no attention. And there should be no tolerance for this low brow behavior.\n\nObviously these people have never been around a lot of Asian women, because there is nothing obedient about any of them in my family. Caring, yes, but extremely willful.  My mother takes  what would look to an outsider  as a subservient role to my father, but make no mistake she runs our house.", "You reacted poorly, you know that the language you used was derogatory, but the bigger AH is Jenny. I think she will look back on this period of her life and cringe/feel ashamed. At least I hope she does. When you\u2019re young and boy-crazy it\u2019s easy to overlook peoples major flaws. These guys are racist, misogynist pricks. And if they talk that way to you, there\u2019s no way they will respect her. Hopefully what you said will be a wake up call. You can\u2019t undo having sex with misogynistic creeps. Being a minority is hard on a campus. You do what you have to do to protect your energy. If there are any communities you can be a part of that will actually be allies, I encourage you to seek it out.", "ESH. You should apologize for the slur but not your general message. It's up to her to do the right thing and apologize to you. Tough living situation now, but you didn't cause it.", "ESH. James is a racist. Jenny didn't do what she said she would regarding avoiding them, plus she was saying some racist garbage too when you confronted her. And you called her a whore.\n\nYeah. Everyone sucks.", "ESH here. Y\u2019all make me glad I\u2019m in my 40s and have had a good amount of therapy.", "ESH\n\nShe can hang out with who she wants. She's clearly not a very good friend, but you don't sound all that great yourself either.", "ESH (I\u2019m including you only for calling her a whore because slut shaming sucks\u2026 pretty much any other insult to her would have been deserved). But HOW TF does that guy not get expelled for such blatant racism???? \n>\nI cannot comprehend someone saying something so incredibly disturbing and disgusting to my friend and continue to spend time with them. Jenny clearly isn\u2019t a friend. Everyone who heard him say those things to you and didn\u2019t shut him down are just as bad as he is.", "NTA - I think you should apologize for the slur, but not your general message. Your friend was being racist and that's really shitty. Why did no one call that guy out for his blatant racism? You are under no obligation to hang out with this group of friends anymore.  \n\n\nAlthough, I will say one thing - you can't fully expect someone to stop hanging out with people who are/have been mean to you, if they're close friends with that person. It's their life - they can choose who they hang out with.", "ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The comments weren't just racist but misogynistic too. He wants an obedient woman? And Jenny is jealous because this racist misogynist is attracted to her friend. It's hard when you're close with someone who gets more attention from the opposite sex than you do, but there's nothing excusable about tolerating bigotry and not standing up for your friend. It's painful to lose a friend, but Jenny has made the choices here that lead to that. OP, stand your ground.
