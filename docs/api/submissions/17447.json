Our wedding is 3 and a half weeks away, and all the arrangements have been made. \n\nAfter a family dinner this weekend, my sister, K who's 32y/o, suggested the two of us go out for some dessert alone. It was a strange suggestion for her to make as we were never really close, but I agreed. However, she simply drove us to a nearby park, where she dropped the bombshell on me that she and D went out for a while. This was before I've ever met D, they went on dates for about a month but it fizzled out, and she repeatedly reassured me that nothing happened between her and D for the two years D and I were together. Also, according to her, after I introduced D to my entire family (about three months into our relationship), she had a discussion with D, hoping D would break it off with me himself. However, D convinced her to simply hide it, as he was happy with me and their short fling shouldn't interfere with our relationship. \n\nI simply felt disgusted and betrayed after learning this. My sister is very non-confrontational and I can understand why she wouldn't want to be the one to tell me, but I've been with D for over two years, lived with him for almost a whole year.  When we got home, I blew up at him in front of our families, for having kept such a large secret to me and being lying to continue lying to me for the rest of his life, and broke off the wedding. He's tried to explain that his fling with my sister meant nothing, but I still believed he should have told me, and this has made me doubt if he has any other secrets he's been keeping from me. \n\nSince then, he, along with his mother and sister, have been persistently bombarding me with calls and texts. They wanted me to go on with the wedding, telling me that D has proved again and again how much he loved me, that the arrangements have all been made and we can't get our deposits back, that I would be letting down our wedding guests. As for my parents, they have expressed that they didn't think D was wrong to hide it from me, but are willing to support whatever decision I come to regarding the wedding. K and I hasn't talked since that night, and my mother told that she was upset that I brought it up in front of our families instead of talking with D privately. I've apologised to her over text, but she hasn't responded to any of my messages. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to continue the wedding for this reason? And how can I resolve things with K?", "created_utc": 1684308556, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13jupcq/aita_for_breaking_off_our_wedding_after_finding/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why only bring it up so soon before the wedding? You\u2018re entitled to react to this news however you want, even if it\u2019s calling off the wedding. I would have too, if someone I loved had lied to my face for two years straight.", "I'm gonna say nta \n\nThem dating isn't the issue. The issue is the fact that he lied to you about it for your whole relationship. He could have told you at the beginning and let you work through it how you needed to at that time, instead of that you're finding out someone you loved and (I'm assuming) trusted explicitly has been lying to you this whole time. \n\nI definitely get where you're coming from, because I would never be able to trust someone again after that. I would question every single thing that comes out of their mouths, or doesnt. Another thing that erks me about these kinds of situations is the fact that these people probably convinced themselves it was for you/to your benefit when all they really did was make it easier on themselves. They hid this because they didn't want to deal with the potential fallout which, to me, says that they don't have much faith in your reactions or ability to process things in a healthy, reasonable manner. I could be off base with that, but that is how I've felt in somewhat similar circumstances. \n\nI do think that exploding in front of your family was a inappropriate, but you're also a human being with emotions and shit happens. Imo, your family should be understanding. \n\nFor your sister, I would recommend reaching out and saying while you're upset that it was kept from you, that you appreciate her telling you and that it's not her fault everything is imploding. She came clean, she did the right thing. I'd imagine she's probably feeling guilty over all of this after being the one to tell you, and as much as she should have told you sooner, at least she did tell you, and before you got married \n\nRealistically what the situation comes down to is what you can live with. If this is something you think you can get past, go ahead with the wedding. If this is something you can't get past then, you have to be true to yourself. A lifetime of unhappiness is worse than lost deposits. It might be worth going to see a councilor and getting a good, healthy, unbiased opinion *and* an unbiased, completely unrelated ear to listen. Sometimes that can be more valuable then you would ever think it would be", "> but I still believed he should have told me, and this has made me doubt if he has any other secrets he's been keeping from me.\n\nThis right here. NTA. If you've lost your faith and trust in your partner, there's not much anyone can do. Your partner, sister, anyone who knew this and hid it from you and let this situation build up until the wedding are assholes. Maybe if you were told this early in the relationship you all would have a laugh and move on but no, they kept it from you for so long.\n\n**Your partner is deep in the wrong, period.** \n\nAnd no need to resolve things with your sister just yet. Your partner wanted to hide it but her loyalty should have been to you and she should've told it to you at that time. She is the one who has to apologize and try to resolve things.", "NTA.\n\nThe most critical thing that this hinges on is whether you had the right to know. With past flings or girlfriends he may have had who are strangers to you, of course you don\u2019t. But when siblings are involved, the whole calculus changes.\n\nAlso, your post is unclear whether it was more a fling or just couple dates. Sometimes those are used interchangeably, but it really matters in your situation. I lean towards that it had elements of intimacy (as opposed to went to have dinner couple times, eh, not really a match, good-bye).\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t understand your sister\u2019s motivation in revealing this so late in the game. Was it to relieve herself of some kind of shame or burden? If it\u2019s truly no big deal, then why not stay silent on it forever? Her intentions reek of suspiciousness.\n\nAll of the above added together amounts to deception. Your response to such deception, in this case, I think is justified.", " nta, your partner withheld information from you and thats starting a Relationship on bad merits. although,  im a little intrigued as to why your sister needed you to know soo bad if it wasnt anything serious.", "It was a one-month fling.\n\nIt happened before he met you.\n\nHe didn't want to jeopardize his relationship with you as he really liked you (and ended up proposing).\n\nWhy is your sis telling you now, less than a month before your wedding?\n\n *she had a discussion with D, hoping D would break it off with me*\n\nIs she jealous that he loves you and never had more than a fling with her? That he wants to marry you and not her?\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 wasn't honest in hiding this fact, but he really wanted to make it work with you.\n\nYour sister is an A H for trying to make you break up just weeks before the wedding.\n\nNTA for what ever choice you're making, but think it over and talk with D. Go see a therapist together if you like.\n\nGo NC with K for the moment. She's definitely not your priority now. If you continue the wedding, uninvite her.\n\nD. wants to be happy together with you. K. just wanted to ruin your relationship with D.", "ESH\n\nYour fiance sucks for keeping this a secret from you for 2 years. I can understand if he was uncomfortable at the beginning of the relationship and didn't want to say anything, but 2 years is an awful long time to keep something like dating your sister before you. Relationships are based on trust and honesty, not deceits.\n\nYour sister sucks because she had 2 years to do what's right and push D to talk with you about it but instead waited before the wedding to do it.\n\nYou also suck (albeit less IMO) not because you got mad (which I could understand given the nature of the news and that you felt betrayed) but for how you handled things: they took you away so they can talk this through with you alone, yet you chose to wait until you got back home so you can blow up at D in front of both your families and cause a scene.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow whether or not you go through with the wedding is entirely up to you - this is not a decision some strangers on the internet can make for you. I'd suggest sleeping on this and then if you think you can handle it - arrange for couples therapy with D and see if this really is a deal-breaker for you or your relationship can be salvaged.\n\nAs for your sister K - until you figure out where you stand with D on this issue, you won't be able to come to terms with K either. I'd suggest giving yourselves some time off to think things through and then contacting her once you're satisfied with whatever decision you've reached.\n\nGood luck, OP!", "NTA. This isn't about the fiance reasonably having relationships before meeting OP. It's about his inability to trust, believe, and be honest with OP. His possible future life partner. This particular past relationship info needed clearity and open communication, not hiding\n\nIs fiance ready for marriage if he can't have faith in OP? In the future, what else may come down into their lives that he will keep secret? What else will he decide OP cannot handle?", "NTA,\n\nYour supposed to be able to trust the person you want to be the rest of your life and this breaks that trust, this should have been mentioned from the start of the relationship its your sister if it was a Stanger this would not have been an issue.", "Does it matter if YTA?\n\nWhat matters is that you make the choice that\u2019s right for you. If you can\u2019t live with it, you can\u2019t live with it.", "NTA\n\nWhen D is faced with a situation where he could potentially lose you or rock the boat in any way, and his go to solution is to lie and hide information, that is not a solid basis to start a marriage on. Maybe it's a pattern, maybe it's not, but I would have trouble saying yes to a person who's lied to me for years.", "More info needed, were they intimate? You probably had a right to know, I\u2019ll give you that, but if they only hade dinner a couple times probably wouldn\u2019t be grounds for canceling the wedding. If they had slept together I\u2019d call this deceitful and weird.", "NTA. Trust is important and he has shown he cannot be trusted. If he's hiding this, he could be hiding more. How would you know?", "NTA\n\nSecrets like this almost always come out. D should have been truthful from the beginning, but lying was more convenient. What else could he lie about? \n\nAlso, do not listen to him or his family. They're worried about losing deposits and all the arrangements. It sounds like they care more about the wedding than you two having an actual healthy happy relationship.", "NTA. Trust is huge. Arguably the most important part of a marriage. That he broke yours by lies of omission is a big deal. Don't marry anyone you feel insure of, it just isn't worth it. Both of them should have told you immediately 2 year ago and you could have decided then whether or not to get deeper into a relationship. This feels like a betrayal.", "NTA.\n\nOP, it is a huge flag that D never wanted to be honest with you about having dated your sister.\n\nIt is also a huge flag that he and his flying monkeys (mom and sister) are bombarding you AND that some of their arguments for continuing with the wedding are (1) the cost/the plans have been made and (2) the guests!?! So you should spend the next 70+ years joined in life to someone who has betrayed your trust so that the guests won't be disappointed with the pageantry of a wedding? or that you don't lose the cake deposit? That's what matters most to them?\n\nThem having dated in the past isn't as concerning as D wanting to keep it a secret from you forever, but both are big deals. They are worth AT LEAST putting a pause on the wedding and giving you time to process ALL this information.\n\nI don't see your sister in the same light as D. Your sister had wanted to tell you, and it weighed on her so much that she couldn't let you get married to D, not knowing the truth. Yes, she helped keep the secret, but mainly because of D's influence.", "ESH \n\nBecause while you have the option to throw this away, this still doesn't seem like something pre-planned. Surely you haven't told him all of your relationships of the past. And if this happened like 5-6 years back, there's no reason to doubt his faithfulness to you unless he has cheated with others **during the relationship**. It's a lie, of course, wrong, but maybe one that can be discussed with everyone on the table and openly also, to know what happened exactly.\n\nI would doubt the sister more here.\n\n>Also, according to her, after I introduced D to my entire family (about three months into our relationship), she had a discussion with D, hoping D would break it off with me himself. However, D convinced her to simply hide it, as he was happy with me and their short fling shouldn't interfere with our relationship.\n\nWhy should we believe your sister here? Something else could have transpired there and maybe K revealed it only at the end precisely to put doubts in your mind. There was nothing stopping her from revealing the truth all this while, even if D had mentioned otherwise.\n\nThere is some scope to read jealousy here on the part of K, that he daringly went on to date you, and K was waiting for the opportune moment to get back at him, since he went against her advice and yet dated to you. K is no saint here. She's also very much responsible irrespective of what transpired.", "If it's not a big deal why didn't he tell you?\n\nNTA", "If you\u2019re going out with someone who could say \u201cThat\u2019s not how your sister does it\u201d is time to walk away!", "You let your sister break you up. She is the only one winning here.", "You\u2019re NTA, they are for lying and hiding it for years.", "Wow.\n\nNTA. It\u2019s cheaper to end it now and lose your deposits than go through with it and end it later when these red flags turn out to signal something.\n\nThe right way for D to handle it would be to be upfront as soon as he realized, tell you \u201coh my, I used to date your sister. But that\u2019s in the past, I\u2019m happy with you, let\u2019s move forward.\u201d You might still have ended it, because maybe that\u2019s a dealbreaker, but at least he\u2019d have been upfront.\n\nThis was hiding a major secret, convincing your sister to cover for him\u2026 red flag city.

Clearly he could see what would happen if you found out, an unreasonable overreaction, but at the same time when entering a marriage it would probably be a good idea to mention it just in case it comes up. The fact he left it this late is on him. \n\nI don't think your reaction in front of the family is reasonable given the circumstances and rightfully your sister and (ex?) partner are annoyed about it. You should have spoken to them separately and not blown up in front of the family. However his and his family's reactions are also unfair, ultimately it's up to the two people involved only, as to whether the wedding goes ahead. \n\nTo be frank it seems as though there's a huge amount of disfunction here, with little to no lines of positive communication, it's probably a good thing the marriage isn't going ahead.", "EHS.\n\nWhat about this disgusts you? Nothing happened, according to them. He's allowed to have had a life before you, no one can help that it was with your sister.

To stir the pot, what? Do you think there are some unrequited feelings there and she's hoping that he'll go back to her or do you think she was genuinely looking out for you?\n\nHe sucks because even though he's not obliged in any way to tell you about his history, a little courtesy goes a long way, just so you're not blindsided because it will come out eventually.", "NTA your ex is dishonest.

Your fiance is allowed to date other people before he met you. He doesn't have to tell you about them even if you know them.

He is no longer a safe partner.", "E kinda SH, your feelings are valid here, definitely. but did he straight up lie to you or simply not tell you? lying would be one thing, and while not telling you would hurt too, it would mean he didn\u2019t go out of his way to be dishonest. i would communicate with him, it doesn\u2019t mean you have to get back together or go through with it, but just to clear the air if nothing else. storming off and ignoring everyone won\u2019t resolve anything, especially since you said yourself you want to resolve things. \n\nsomeone definitely should have told you sooner i agree since it was with family even if it was in the past, so they\u2019re both AH\u2019s for not just communicating that. though based on how / why / when your sister told you i have to wonder if she\u2019s still into D even if it\u2019s not mutual. since she\u2019d hoped he would break up with you at some point, not just that he\u2019d tell you about it, and she waited until you were engaged to say anything. even as someone non confrontational, if it was something she felt was that important, she could\u2019ve easily said something much sooner.", "It should have been open right from the start 2 years ago \"Oh, Yeah we know each other.

It was a bombshell and possibly she could have made it a bit softer but it was likely going to blow up. She may even be getting blamed for 'ruining the wedding', which is uncalled for. The two of you don't deserve to carry some liars baggage. She had to carry an increasingly heavy weight and it sounds like she wanted to be honest long ago but was dissuaded.

Of course the fact he dated sis isn't necessarily that big a deal considering how short a period it was, but the fact he went out his way to hide it in the first place makes it a bigger deal that it should have been. I will say, I don't think it's necessary to have details on every relationship in your past, but if you've dated someone in your current partners life, they should know about it. \n\nI agree otherwise, op didn't necessarily handle this well, but she's not wrong to end relationship.", "It was not because of dating before they met, it was because he lied about it...", "Everyone has a past but that past is related to her it\u2019s her sister, everyone else knew this information but not her, he proved nothing because nothing was said to her, if it was a stranger then of course he doesn\u2019t have to say anything but again his past is literally related to her the ex will always be there because it\u2019s her sister.", "of course dating before your partner if well with in his right, but her sister that should have been said then there would be no problem, everyone has a past but that past is related to her, its not fair that everyone knows this information and her.", "It\u2018s about lying to your partner not him having had a life before meeting her.", "Yes, sounds a bit suspicious.

He just didn't tell her about one aspect of his past.\n\nIf all is going brilliantly in a relationship, it's never easy to say *\"Oh BTW, I dated your sister for a month, years back\"*. Maybe he should have, but it's not a betrayal, and to break up over it is OTT.", "Maybe because k thought he would tell? Couldn\u2019t live with the idea that her sister is getting married with someone who hides? This was the first time she could catch her privately?\n\nNTA. Send a message to thank her for her warning and for showing you that your ex was hiding things. That you don\u2019t blame her at all. Give her some time then. \n\nAnd yes, this is a good reason to call of wedding. Marrying isn\u2019t about deposits or dresses or venues or whatever. It\u2019s about telling the world this is the guy you want to be with for the rest of your life.
