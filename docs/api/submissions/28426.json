We\u2019re heavy travelers but have never thought of going to D.C. until a college friend got a nice gig there and our group wanted to hold a celebration and reunion with him. We decided to spend a day checking through the city. \n\nAfter doing everything as planned for a whole day, my boyfriend suddenly wanted us to visit the Vietnam War memorial. I have known the story of his grandfather being a KIA fighter pilot in Vietnam since we started dating, but I\u2019ve never imagined myself in this situation. My grandmother died in 1972 when U.S. bombs, whether intentionally or not, hit a civilian village in Hanoi. My mother was 2 at the time and that story has a great impact on me. So I didn\u2019t want to go with him and said I would love to visit and pay respect at his grandfather\u2019s grave but not a war memorial. My boyfriend does not get angry easily at all but he was VERY upset today. I don\u2019t know.

It takes a terrible lack of empathy to react like this. He wanted to go, which is fine, but to expect you to value it the same way is troubling.", "Nta, it was literally a WAR AGAINST YOUR COUNTRY for no reason and you lost family.\n\nIt makes sense for him to care about his grandfather, but US involvement in that war is nothing to be proud of", "NTA Your grandmother (an innocent civilian) died in a war fought against your country by the U.S. it is completely understandable that you would not want to attend a U.S.-centric memorial re: that war. I think it was a lovely offer to pay respects at your bf\u2019s grandfather\u2019s grave. He should not expect you to sweep aside your feelings to accommodate his.", "We pay our respects and acknowledge pain and sacrifice in many different ways, after all. I'm sorry that he feels slighted. But, his feelings are his to manage. What about your feelings?\n\nNTA. Its not a universally accepted demonstration of support among people who love each other. And I think your BF should have asked you well ahead of time if you'd like to visit the memorial.", "NTA. My family is from South Vietnam, and I was born in the U.S.\n\nThe loss of innocent civilians in war is always a tragedy. You did not make it a big deal or bring politics into it. Regardless of the intent, the fact is that the U.S. and the Vietnam War led to the death of your grandmother. It is entirely understandable that you don't want to visit a memorial commemorating the war.", "NTA, you have a legitimate reason to not want to go. And you offered to pay respects to his grandpa grave-side. It\u2019s fairly insane your bf can\u2019t understand where you\u2019re coming from on this. He needs to step outside his own worldview for a few minutes to see another perspective.", "NTA. I'm astonished he didn't immediately say it was okay. Had it been me, I'd have also apologized for being insensitive enough to even ask you to go.", "NTA.  Your family\u2019s experience of the war was very different from his, so it evokes very different feelings. He likely wouldn\u2019t want to go to the War Memorial in Hanoi for the same (valid) reason. \n\nI will say, the Vietnam war memorial in DC does a great job of being a place of mourning and remembrance, not a place of glory.  Of all the war memorials in DC, it\u2019s the one that promotes introspection and reflection instead of patriotism and militarism.", "NTA. Remind him that wasn\u2019t an honorable event for you. And countries other than the US exist that have been targeted by the US. My uncle was a captain in the war. He would NEVER ask this of someone, god rest his soul. I distinctly remember him ranting about how you don\u2019t do this circa 2002 and a coworker of a relative being brought up. Said that only a moron or a monster would make someone visit a commemoration of their dead loved ones presented as praise for their killers. Because the harsh reality is that memorial commemorates the folks who cost your family so much. \nAsk yourself if sacrificing yourself and becoming less is worth it with him. Even when we\u2019re gay we can be unaware and make not so great choices. My assumption is he thinks you\u2019re snubbing his grandpa, not realizing you\u2019re still trying to protect your grandma in a way. You have every right to do so. He also doesn\u2019t seem to grasp you respectfully not going is better than going and making a big deal. Needing to sacrifice you and your heritage so he doesn\u2019t have to go alone is very selfish on his part. \nMaybe have a talk with him, but don\u2019t be less so he can have more. You and your family deserve better than to have that peace and safety shaken or taken for a man", "I'm sorry for you're loss Vietnam was a war that should've never happened", "NTA. Your partner is TA for being dramatic and manipulative, and seemingly completely forgetting your family history associated with the war. I don't understand why there are so many NAH, when it's the other person who became toxic when he could have just politely and respectfully agreed to meet up later.", "NAH,\n\nHe has reason to want to see the memorial to commemorate his grandfather, and you have reason to not go due to family history. \n\nThere are going to be things in your relationship that you can't share, and this is one.", "NTA\n\nYour situation and the nature of the Vietnam War is much more complex than being right or wrong. Your boyfriend needs to understand that honoring his experience is not more important than honoring your own.", "NTA- a super extreme example would be if one partners relative died in the Holocaust & the other partner wanted to go WOW-factor their Nazi-involved elderly family member.", "Assumptions being made here are crazy.", "Your boyfriend is using silence like a fucking child in a very toxic way. I am in a gay relationship with A Vietnamese man and he would drop my ass in a minute if I was this ignorant and throwing a temper tantrum over your no. Sounds like you all need to get some things straight and he needs to unlearn the American propaganda of that war. Civilians died and those accidents were intentional more often than not. I learned this long before I got into a relationship and would never ask him to go to a place like that.  You are not the asshole but he sur the hell is and the fact he has you second guessing yourself like this is not ok. It creates a toxic balance in a relationship and you need to nip it in the bud before it grows into an issue that always becomes abusive intentionally or not.", "You actually don't need a reason. If you don't want to go somewhere, and he does, he can go, and you'll meet up later. No issues, the way adults do it.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThe thing is that your families could have been on the 'same side' in a war and the two of you could \\*still\\* have different feelings about what happened. It's ok not to do something if you're not 'ready' to. Maybe you will in the future, but it's ok if you don't want to yet.", "NTA. He\u2019s a bit insensitive though.", "Without getting into politics: I don't think you are an asshole here. I think, both of you have complicated pasts and should learn to respect each other boundaries. He should understand your emotional state when it comes to Vietnam war (it is not hard to guess) and stop behaving like there is nothing to be concerned about. I would tell him that when I am emotionally ready I will visit War memorial however that is not the case today. And that I love him. If he choses to be upset about it, that is his choice. You can talk about it later, see what really made him upset and fix it if you can. There is no right and wrong in love. There is only another step to understand , love and respect each other.", "NTA, you both have trauma around the ear that need to be respected and understood as boundaries. His attitude is not only not fair but feels very American in that Americans were the real victims despite being an invading force in a civil war. And very American in the lack of empathy for the indigenous peoples their action impacted. This story is repeated over and over again throughout Asia. It is only a small part of the superiority complex Americans carry with them because of the very lopsided history Americans are taught. \n\nYour BF should redirect your bounties and if he does not consider what he really sees you as in the relationship and if you're ok with that", "NAH literally cultural differences. It\u2019ll just take additional communication. Good luck \u270c\ufe0f", "NTA. He is seeing things through one lens only. He is forgetting that there is another side. And your perspective is as important. As a Veteran myself (not of that war) and can totally understand your perspective. I\u2019m a little concerned about his reaction TBH. Does he do that a lot?", "I\u2019m kinda being nosey here but now I want to ask. \n\nYou both are entitled to feel about the Vietnam war however you both want, but I am going to ask, how much of an issue is this going to affect y\u2019all\u2019s relationship long term? I\u2019m not saying to break up but if y\u2019all are exploring the option of getting married and having kids how\u2019s that going to work long term? Teaching the kids about your family is that gonna be an issue or something you both can ignore and move past?  \n\nYou both seem to have somewhat big feelings about this just curious how that will work long term and something y\u2019all should discuss to figure out if it\u2019s going to be a problem long term for you relationship.", "NTA. And he needs to understand that in war there are 2 sides and therefore 2 perspectives. He can't push one perspective on you.", "NTA.  I don't think visiting the memorial would tarnish or disrespect your grandmother though.  Most of the US soldiers were young men who didn't want to be there either and were only trying to survive.  I'd imagine your grandmother felt much the same, only wanting to live her life.  Politicians don't care to much about collateral damage and its sad.  If the memorial makes you uncomfortable, your bf needs to respect your feelings.", "NTA holy hell what did I just read? Of course you don\u2019t want to go to a memorial to a war fought on your country that literally killed your innocent civilian grandmother. How horribly selfish and insensitive of your boyfriend.", "I\u2019m not going to pretend I can relate to the situation you are going through given the incredible damage the war did to Vietnam, but you should consider that the Vietnam memorial in DC is a very somber one that remembers the losses suffered rather than celebrating anything about the war. It is meant to look like a giant scare carved into the landscape. But if you still feel like you can\u2019t go, than you can\u2019t go. No judgement here.", "I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to go, but you\u2019re bf has a damn good reason to go. \n\nRIP to those who were lost in that shitstorm of a war. All sides.", "Nah.  I wonder if you know what the Vietnam memorial is.  It\u2019s not a monument to the war.  It\u2019s not a celebration of aggression.  It\u2019s a remembrance of lives lost, of the cost of war.  It\u2019s a list of those who died at the demand of their country.  It does not celebrate the loss of your family\u2019s lives.  If anything, it\u2019s a monument to lives lost and damaged.  He should have explained this.  Then, you can decide whether ti go with him to support him.", "NTA", "[deleted]", "NTA and your bf is pretty insensitive to ask imho. \"Want to go to a US memorial for a war in which the US killed your grandmother?\" is the request of someone who has not really considered the emotional impact of that history on you.", "NTA at all! Your boyfriend is TA.", "NAH", "NTA I see why they wanted to go and why you didn\u2019t. They were extremely inconsiderate with asking you to go!!!!", ">My grandmother died in 1972 when U.S. bombs, whether intentionally or not, hit a civilian village in Hanoi\n\nit speaks well of your character that you're willing to give this completely undeserved benefit of the doubt", "NTA. But we should all ask ourselves what is the best for the relationship, since you guys have been together for 6 years I can imagine there are intentions to take it further. It is totally justified for you not to go to that memorial, as a person above said, a U.S.-centric memorial. But I think you should make good to visit his grandfather\u2019s grave soon, when you guys have time. It will help ease things.", "I already said my opinion above but does anyone feel really sad that a war ended 50 years ago still become a barrier for a happy young gay couple today? Even when U.S. - Vietnam (still controlled by the communist party) relationship has reached the level of near allies? The wounds of war really are extreme difficult to heal. I wish politicians would understand the long lasting consequences of their actions before they used the power entrusted to them.", "NTA- you are being respectful and he is not. I would reconsider being with someone who behaves this way honestly", "NTA\n\nYou did not tell him he couldn't go. You also offered to visit the grave. But you also have a context. He needs to understand that.", "The Vietnam war was extremely unpopular,  but the memorial simply acknowledges that people died...No war is something to say...\"what a great thing that is...but the two of you could go and privately honor those you feel were the victims... Everyone in that era was A victim in one way...Its long past the time to argue or fight over what side you were on...Agree to pay your respects in your own way and do something that means something to your partner ...That is what love is about\n\nI am going to add that there were no winners or losers in the Vietnam war ..It was a horrific and brutal war that cost many people their lives on both side... The memorial can be what we want it to be...For me it is to remember the dead without choosing sides,  placing blame or making heros out of some... It's just about remembering the dead and learnimg from the mistakes of the past\n\nThat's my opinion", "INFO - Had he previously discussed with you to go to the memorial? It sounds like this conversation came up in the past and he had made it clear how important it is for him. If it is true and you never told him why you would not see the memorial to him then you would be the AH.", "Nta. But i think this is a very good oppurtunity here, dear OP. You are seeing exactly what value you stand in your boyfriend's life. This was a war against your country, a war that left a huge huge impact on your family. I donot think this war is something your mother will ever talk fondly about. If he wanted to visit his grandfather's grave, then thats just fine. But it takes a severely lack of uncaringness to visit that war memorial. Maybe this is a hill to die on.", "NTA it\u2019s just a wall anyways. There\u2019s so many amazing museums to see right across the street instead", "NTA - but neither is your bf. Both of you have emotional ties to Vietnam, so that makes the emotions run deep. I can understand why you would not want to visit the memorial\n\nThe way I see the Vietnam Memorial is not as a celebration of war or victory as many memorials are, but as a symbol mourning those who were lost.\n\nIn saying this, I mean absolutely no disrespect to the loss of your grandmother in any way or form nor am I dismissing your reasons for not wanting to visit.\n\nMay your Grandmother's memory always be blessed.\n\nEdit to add - have you explained the reasons why you don;t want to visit the memorial, or did you just say \"no, because that may make a difference in his anger at your refusal to go to the Wall.", "First off, NAH.\n\nI can definitely see your point of view but I can also see his. Here\u2019s the thing though: You don\u2019t have to view the memorial negatively. It\u2019s there to remind us of ALL the lives lost in a brutal war that never should have happened and is a stain on this country\u2019s history. I think you can go there and honor your grandmother\u2019s memory while he honors his grandfather\u2019s.", "NTA you lost your grandmother due to this", "NTA OMG", "NTA. Your boyfriend needs to learn empathy. The Vietnam War was a war against your country of birth where you lost family members simply because they lived there. If he can\u2019t understand that, he isn\u2019t worth your affections and move on. \n\nIf he wants to honor his KIA grandfather, that\u2019s his business but insisting YOU honor his grandfather by visiting the Vietnam Memorial with him is a whole different story.", "NAH.", "NTA, His grandfather was basically a monster.

As much as you should respect his loss, he should respect yours.", "No.  You are not the AH.  You both have history and trauma from the war.   Even generations later.   You don\u2019t have to go to something that impacted you and your family so much and he can go alone if he wants.

War is not something to celebrate and always comes with 2 sides.  This is likely not a match for you. NTA", "NTA. He can go alone.

Like, you guys propped up and supported Pol Pot, you more than likely killed her grandmother.", "Hatred of the government is not the same as hatred of the country itself. The us should not have been in vietnam period. The gov lied to their own citizens and their own troops to invade them, and they still lost", "He was blaming us because it was literally our fault.

War will never go away is a bullshit excuse to avoid taking responsibility.", "Don't downplay these vets. That memorial is for them. Our boys that died for no reason.", "Yes.

And OP replied in another comment that he told his family\u2019s story to his boyfriend years ago, and on the day he said you know my family history so I don\u2019t want to go. Again you\u2019re making shitty assumptions.", "Where does it say he went on a rampage?? He just explained to us reading the post about the background. All he says that he said to his boyfriend is that he would love to pay respects and his boyfriends grandfathers grave but does not want go to a war memorial", "The US is responsible for his grandmother\u2019s death. If you want to debate whether or not the war was justified, that\u2019s a whole different conversation, but the bombing of her village was carried out by the US military. \n\nOP doesn\u2019t hate the US, he just doesn\u2019t want to go to a war memorial for a war that cost his grandmother her life.", "My guy it was literally a US bomb that killed his grandmother", "I mean, he should have been more understanding. But he probably grew up hearing that all wars waged by the US were \u201cjustified\u201d. I\u2019m guessing he might need to be walked through this a bit more.", "I was talking about civilians because in wars soldiers aren\u2019t usually talked about as victims if you\u2019re familiar with the language.

Whatever happened with your fucked up logic, shame on you for telling these people they\u2019re playing the victim card.", "There was no reason for OP to attend the memorial, and a reason not to. The partner who wants to has every right to go, but no right to expect their partner to change their view.", "I also think it\u2019s the way his boyfriend communicated his feelings to him about the memorial. He could\u2019ve just said look I still have some issues with the whole thing because of where I come from. It\u2019s painful to me but I respect your right to go.\n\nIt sounds like he brought up the whole grandma thing to try and make boyfriend feel bad. There was no reason for it. I think that\u2019s the big problem here. He just blamed us for his grandma\u2018s death and he still not over it and his anger is still there.\n\nAgain if we were so Bad and he has so much anger towards us why are they here? Because if they go back they probably will be killed.", "And that makes a difference why? The point of the story was the US killed his grandma and he\u2019s mad", "OP doesn't seem bitter either.

He just doesn\u2019t want to go to a memorial commemorating the invaders", "[removed]", "he said \"drove away the nazis from concentration camps\" instead of maybe wording it better like \"fought the nazis and liberated the camps\" because when you're talking about medics then driving people away you'd tend to think that means the medics are helping those people, literally driving them away. but reddit isn't the smartest place i see.", "Its not. Its true.", "Ahh, yes because theres a plethora of successful communist states.", "it's true....", "Just to put it out there that Germany has put in the work culturally, educationally, and legally to ensure that the holocaust never happens again. America has done literally fuck all in comparison.", "The holocaust had nothing to do with christianity.", "There is very little difference in the outcome of open fascism and fascism disguised as communism.

The only people who think they\u2019re even in the same league are the idiots who still don\u2019t realize that Cold War propaganda was just propaganda.", "Becuase of exactly that point. It makes no sense for people to consistently discuss the need to fight fascism, as is ongoing in western politics and yet somehow fighting communism was worthless.", "They're in high school... or they're on r/highschool talking shit to teenagers. Either way, they can't embarrass us when they can't even enlist to begin with.", "[removed]", "I\u2019m not doubling down. We exited the war after a lot of protest and demands.

Look what\u2019s going on now.\n\nWe just need to make America great we\u2019ve been working on it for over 200 years and hopefully will continue to work on it. That\u2019s my point there is no perfect country why do you think everyone wants to immigrate here because we are better than most. He\u2019s the one that brought up it\u2019s our fault that his grandma died. I think everyone has a story of a family member who died in war. And just remember most of the people in this war were drafted.", "Actually the French started the war. His family should have stayed and defended his county and let pol pot take care of them.", "Ok so why is his family here if we are so horrible?  The Japanese killed our people in ww2 so should we hate them also?", "And the draft got most of them.

Vietnam - U.S. diplomatic relations has been normalized since 1995. I was not in the room to say whether OP made his boyfriend feel bad or not, but neither was you. You\u2019re making a baseless assumption. From my perspective he didn\u2019t want to go and he gave a reason for it, he also respected his boyfriend\u2019s right to go. Among the names on the memorial there could potentially people who carried out the action and killed his grandmother. He really shouldn\u2019t go.", "Should OP not blame the US for murdering his civilian grandmother?
