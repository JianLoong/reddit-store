Which is 100% true, it\u2019s not like I made it up.

It\u2019s a shame you had to use religion to be comfortable in the office. If his smell is so bad it causes headaches the door should be open. That shouldn\u2019t be rocket science.\n\nI wonder if HR would like to be in a closed room with him for hours?\n\nEdit: Also, don\u2019t let people make you feel bad for asking for religious accommodation. They\u2019re jerks.", "NTA.  It was very clever of you to find such an great solution.  He can't help having a medical condition, and you can't help being very bothered by the smell, to the point of having physical pain (headaches).  You asked HR for help, and they wrongly refused, so you solved the problem yourself.\n\nHis preference to have the door closed does not trump your reasonable need to have the door open because his smell is so overpowering and terrible. He is an AH for not caring that his medical condition is affecting your health and well being.", "Normally I'd agree with him since your religion clearly isn't the reason you need the accommodating since you are fine sharing a space with a man but I'm gonna go with NTA because you really did your best to resolve the situation without embarrassing this sweaty dude and you give him the benefit of the doubt on his hygiene so you had to do what you had to do to do your job. If he comments on it again I'd let him know the real reason you had to take such drastic measures.", "NTA. You should HAVE to pull the religion card to get something done. You did what you had to do to to get a better working environment.", "Hahaha I did not expect to read this. \n\nNAH. You gotta do what you gotta do. He shouldn't be so sensitive about it but at the same time he may have a right to feel a little bit hurt. I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt. You are definitely not TA in any case.", "NTA. I think you handled the situation as diplomatically as you could. (HR people *hate* situations like this). Hopefully he can get some noise-canceling headphones.", "Ehhhhh because HR refused to do anything before, NTA. In literally any other scenario, you would be the AH for claiming a religious need you actually don't observe, but fighting a hostile work environment caused by unreasonable catering to one protected class (medical issue) with reasonable accommodations for another protected class (religious group) is genius.", "NTA.  He has a medical condition.  You have a religious accommodation.  That's life in the grown up lane.", "NTA, you have something and used it. You didnt lie and got yourself an environment where you can actually get work done without headaches. I dont see anything wrong with that.", "NTA\n\nIt is only an AH move if it's not truly in your religion or you don't truly believe it. You are not an AH for finally standing up for your beliefs, even if it took a non-religious motivation to get you to go there.", "NTA - But I would also put in an anonymous complaint about that person's hygiene after so many hrs at work. He either needs more deodorant or may have a medical condition he doesn't realize is 'that bad'. Either way HR can be the one to discuss it with him.", "NTA but you are working with assholes. I'm just jealous I couldn't do this myself.", "NTA, you tried to solve it the \u201ctraditional\u201d way, but your HR department were either incompetent or  AHs themselves. And like you said, you did not make it up.", "NTA - You didn\u2019t lie, and even if you had to so be it. Would he had rather you have told him the truth, that he smells so horrid it makes another human being feel physically ill? How embarrassing for him. If he keeps making an issue out of it I\u2019d just tell him outright (and loud enough for all to hear) that you did it purely to preserve his dignity because he smells worse than a hobo. Maybe he\u2019ll get the hint then and shut his gob.", "NTA but if he's going to play the \"you're an ah for playing the religion card\" card then you should tell him it's actually his stink.", "Make a peace offering and get him headphones to reduce the noise", "NTA \n\nYou should not have to use the religion card though!\n\nThat is vile. I could not work anywhere smelling a colleagues body odour. \n\nI would be pushing that higher up. \n\nAnd mate, he can do something about his medical condition!  Shower at work, change clothes, I don\u2019t care. But. Yuck!!!!", "[removed]", "INFO\n\n>  I went to HR and told them that per my religion, I can be in an isolated space with a man I am not married to.\n\nI assume you meant **the opposite** of what you *actually* wrote here?", "NTA but if I was your employer, depending on the field if you have to be separated from 50 percent of the customers or merchants we have to make deals, I would consider you not fit for the job. Taking the smell in consideration, that can be unbearable. Given that hr didn't give a shit, you were using your last chance. I also have a colleague which stinks. Even though we are in a big space it gives me headaches. He doesn't have any right to be angry, if he has a condition he should learn using antiperspirants.", "YTA. The truth of the matter is that you don't mind being in a closed office with him, regardless. Instead of doing the decent thing which is try to have a really difficult discussion with him, you did pull the religion card. Difficult discussions are just that, they're difficult. But it's significantly more unkind to just pull that card that automatically gets you your way for your comfort and over rides what he needs for his own comfort. \n\nNow... when you said forbidden, I assume that the company gave it the same gravity as one would to something \"haram\" like eating pork. If I'm not mistaken, there's nothing in the Quran that makes it haram. It's something pulled from Hadeeth, which cannot render an act haram when it's not set out in the Quran. I'll leave this here because I feel like it's an important distinction to make and probably one that HR don't understand. If they did, I don't know what they would do with it to be fair. It might not change their stance. I completely accept that there's going to be commentary on this. Go nuts my dudes.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your coworker can request another office or the ability to work from home.", "NTA. You had to do what was needed to get the result you needed. I can't think of a medical condition which exists whereby the person has poor hygiene. He is causing a health hazard by being there, and in this modern post-pandemic era... he should be doing his job working from home to prevent stinking up the shared office.\nI'd go as far as to gag and puke whilst he's around to show how intolerable his aroma is.", "You're NTA. He may not know it,  but he would have liked it a lot less if you told him the real reason.", "The guy can get earplugs or headphones. He'll be fine. You getting a nose plug would be way more conspicuous and embarrassing for everyone involved. Do what you gotta do. I also saw in another comment that your religious accommodation is genuine, although you were willing to let it slide previously. Obviously and extremely NTA for many reasons.", "NTA because he did the same thing first.\n\nHe managed to claim he smells as a \"medical issue\" so he can't be pulled up on it, so you pulling the religion card to get around the problem is completely fair", "NTA: you did what you had to do, and as a plus you are following your religious guidelines. So win win!", "NTA - the fact that he can\u2019t help smelling bad doesn\u2019t make the smell go away. It\u2019s unfair of him to expect people to be locked in with said smell and unfair of HR to expect you to \u2026 hold your breath? It sucks that he\u2019s mad but compromises have to happen sometimes in shared spaces.", "NTA.

I didn\u2019t want people to start saying my religiousness is weird (which happened in my last job, because I used to have to pray in the break room).", "Obviously she DOESN'T truly believe it because she didn't bring that up at the very beginning. She only used it as a crutch after a period of time, so it's just an excuse, not the truth.", "I already went to HR about his smell, they said it was due to a medical condition, and that there was nothing they could do about it.", "I think you commented on the wrong post", "I'm sure it's a typo", "Yes, thank you, autocorrect got me", "OP did mean the opposite, in islam touching someone of the opposite gender after a certain age without marriage is completely forbidden( unless it happens accidently or its needed ofc).", "I can interact with customers and male colleagues, just not in an enclosed space, which having a simple open door solves.", "Still replying to the wrong post", "Anyone who calls you weird just lock them in the room with him at 3pm!", "Scented stuff at your desk. There are some that can be attached to the back of your computer. You can also put out some small stuff that simply has a pleasant scent you can waft your way. Also, see if you can angle your desk as far away from him as possible (claim it's for the lighting, or to see out the window, better view of the office, anything). But having scented stuff at your desk may be your save-all in this.", "Not actually forbidden, but contact is largely avoided as it would invalidate a 'clean' status gained by wudu' or ghusl (so she cannot do shalat and a few other stuff).

The stinky man is your son", "Thankfully just having the door open (since I sit facing the door) helps a lot. I bought some small plants and those tend to help too. Air fresheners and diffusers did nothing but make it stink more", "I'm talking about physical contact on skin, that is forbidden. Touching the opposite gender only breaks your whudhu or ghusal if you follow a certain mathhub, I'm pretty sure it's the Shaafi'i mathhab."]}
