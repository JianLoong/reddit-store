The truth of the matter is that you don't mind being in a closed office with him, regardless. Instead of doing the decent thing which is try to have a really difficult discussion with him, you did pull the religion card. Difficult discussions are just that, they're difficult. But it's significantly more unkind to just pull that card that automatically gets you your way for your comfort and over rides what he needs for his own comfort. \n\nNow... when you said forbidden, I assume that the company gave it the same gravity as one would to something \"haram\" like eating pork. If I'm not mistaken, there's nothing in the Quran that makes it haram. It's something pulled from Hadeeth, which cannot render an act haram when it's not set out in the Quran. I'll leave this here because I feel like it's an important distinction to make and probably one that HR don't understand. If they did, I don't know what they would do with it to be fair.

Just coz OP happens to exceptionally benefit, we should not accept her imposing religion at work.\n\nThis woman/man expecting me to perform as my boss? My religion will not allow me to take one-on-one feedback, oh dear. I am supposed to manage him/her? But I cannot do performance reviews! This is the logical next step of picking and choosing coworkers on religious grounds.", "Just because she pulled rare pro-woman religious segregation win, does not mean the principle is OK.\n\nWomen suffer from religious gender segregation significantly.\n\nIn theocracies, it translates to women not being able to enter work force or apply for passport. In cults it translates to girls doing chores and being conditioned to bear children.\n\nThe company sucks and OP is a hypocrite. ESH.", "Very ironic take, in view that religious segregation is extremely harmful to women in particular.\n\nHave you not read the soft stories here : \"My family is very Cristian, I never got college fund like my brothers, I had to do chores, and now I feel bad I intend to move and live my life?\" You go girl!\n\nIn actual theocracies, segregation of women from non-relative males mean they cannot enter workers force, and choose the life they want. Women are often even not legally emancipated.\n\nJust coz OP could pull a rare reverse uno of regious hypocrisy benefitting a woman, I won't applaud it.", "I am very sorry you seem to work in unsafe environment, or have had unfortunate environment before.\n\nI share my office with a man, but the idea I would need to fear him is very absurd to me - and for that I am privileged.\n\nReligious gender segregation is awful for women in general. It means they cannot freely work, and choose the life they want. In softer forms, it is girls raised in the west to be wifes. In theocracies, it means women never being emancipated.\n\n\nJust because OP could pull uno reverse card here does not mean I ever can applaud bringing religion where it does not belong.", "They should either allow one, or the other, to work from home, or arrange single occupant space for the person that has medical condition.\n\nNow that OP has established religious segregation, why should they accept one-on-one performance review or meeting from a male boss? Why should pious person accept to manage a woman, if they are a man, because they need one-on-one time to be a manager?\n\nOP possibly stops there, but they don't have to."]}
