Hopefully he can get some noise-canceling headphones.", "Ehhhhh because HR refused to do anything before, NTA. In literally any other scenario, you would be the AH for claiming a religious need you actually don't observe, but fighting a hostile work environment caused by unreasonable catering to one protected class (medical issue) with reasonable accommodations for another protected class (religious group) is genius.", "NTA.

The truth of the matter is that you don't mind being in a closed office with him, regardless. Instead of doing the decent thing which is try to have a really difficult discussion with him, you did pull the religion card. Difficult discussions are just that, they're difficult. But it's significantly more unkind to just pull that card that automatically gets you your way for your comfort and over rides what he needs for his own comfort. \n\nNow... when you said forbidden, I assume that the company gave it the same gravity as one would to something \"haram\" like eating pork. If I'm not mistaken, there's nothing in the Quran that makes it haram. It's something pulled from Hadeeth, which cannot render an act haram when it's not set out in the Quran. I'll leave this here because I feel like it's an important distinction to make and probably one that HR don't understand. If they did, I don't know what they would do with it to be fair.

I tried talking with HR about the situation,\n\nINFO: I didn't understand if you beat around the bush to keep the door open and go to HR or straight up address the issue; after him refusing you decided to go to HR?", "NTA. At the very least he could freshen himself up and apply deodorant.", "NTA. Regardless of the religious accommodation, why does he get to choose if the door is open or closed?", "NTA\n\nYou and HR found the solution....the door stays open.  He needs to get over it.", "ESH.\n\nThe company should be able to provide proper ventilation and therefore should make an accommodation for the gentleman with the medical condition by improving the ventilation. Or, they should swap people around between different offices - unless there is a specific reason why the two of you HAVE to share an office.\n\nYou decided to play the religious card because you didn't get your own way when you complained about the sweat smell - this you have admitted and therefore you are definitely an AH. It is utterly amazing how many different ways religious people interpret and use their religion to get their own way. \n\nThe chap, however, should be happy to make accommodations to allow for the ventilation of the room due to his body odour until such time as the organisation can arrange a permanent solution. The chap himself is also an AH for not taking into account the fact that he has an unpleasant body odour and complaining about the door being open.", "NTA.  If HR knows it's a medical condition, then he's well aware of his stench. Almost sounds like a kink he has, closing you up in the room with his smell, again, that he's aware of.", "I am split on this. Y T A for not asking for the accommodation from day 1. When you pull the card after trying other things it just comes across fake and hurts others who are more observant in the long run. You were fine with violating your religion until his smell got to you. You are NTA for doing whatever you could to get away from stinky \n\nI worked with someone with this problem. The final solution was to give them a private office and leave the door closed all day. My guess is he had the office with the door closed because others complained in the past that he stunk up the whole office suite. Mgt knew this but stuck you in there. They can't fire him for a medical condition I am sure he has documented.", "YTA. I get that he stinks but using the religion card to get your way is shitty. What you needed to do was push back against HR when they said its a medical condition so there was nothing they could do because your headaches from his smell are also medical. There was something they could do, they just didnt want to. They could tell him that although he has a medical condition, his smell was causing you to become physically ill if the door was shit so he therefore needs to leave the door open.", "Have you ever been in the minority of any kind?  You probably haven't ever had to find the right accommodation that people in the minority have to make to appease the majority. \n\nYes, she should have spoken up immediately about being uncomfortable alone with an unrelated man.  That doesn't make her an asshole.  She just didn't want the death threats.", "Well maybe she should get some nose canceling headphones?", "The difference is (as far as I see) isn't dependent on the door being open or closed.  OPs religious accommodation is an open door, I would consider that reasonable and not harmful to this guy", "This was her last ditch effort in dealing with his BO. She already tried to bring that up with HR, and due to their response, his odor was something documented (they said he had a medical condition). Her \"religious exemption\" here is in response to the company's failure to enforce the very standard \"clean and well groomed\" expectation in just about every employee handbook. That's also not her place to have that conversation with him. We know what HR is for, but that's what HR and her management team is for.", "Otherwise you\u2019d have to get your doctor to write a note saying the smell from your coworker is making you ill and you cannot be in an enclosed space with him.", "Your religion is not weird. I worked with muslim colleages. Being the manager at that point I always made sure that if anyone needed a break at a certain time they would be on break then.\n\nNo matter if that was the diabetic needing to maintain his sugar levels or the two muslims in the team who wanted to adhere to prayer time. \n\nI think this ist part of being respectful of the other employees to accomodate such things, especially if there are easy fixes like breaks at certain time or having the door open.", "Might I suggest Bose? They're good for the nose, those.", "Why would she do that if her concern comes from his smell? Are the headphones supposed to help out? Explain please \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc \n\n\nNTA btw!", "[deleted]", "This. I'm male, currently share an office with a female, I make darn sure the door is always wide open. I don't want any issues, for either of our sakes.", "If he cannot concentrate on his work, then it hinders him.\n\nOpen space offices are a bane, and when I want to concentrate, am likely to speak in an online meeting or want not be disturbed except on urgent matter, I close my door.\n\nThis is to isolate my noise from others, or other way around. Not having this option because of religious beliefs would be extremely unpleasant to me.\n\nNote : this colleague does not know it is not real conviction of OP, but his odour. Therefore he is annoyed, and for a good reason.", "Obviously the correct accommodation would be for this man to work from home, or have his own office. \n\nOr for the OP to work from home as to be shielded from the \"immodest\" eyes of a random coworker.\n\nI am personally of a conviction that if a person cannot work normally with some genders, they are not owed accomadation that harms others.", "They wrote NOSE canceling headphones. It's a joke.", "NOSE cancelling headphones.", "Read again mate.", "r/woosh", "Reaching soooooo haaaaaard to be mad at this lady lol\n\nSmellyguy isn\u2019t a victim no matter how much you also want to be a victim", "Nothing is \u201cbeing harmed\u201d but your fragile masculinity right now", "\ud83e\udd72", "Oh whoops! Thx for clarifying"]}
