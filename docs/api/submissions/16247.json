She normally has great control of her depression and anxiety, but she has been working a really stressful, low pay job while finishing up her master's program and she's clearly been struggling both mentally and physically for a while. Luckily though everything is turning around and she has graduated and gotten a great new job which she starts in about six weeks. \n\nI was over having dinner with my sister and her husband the other night. They have three very young children and have been struggling with child care. Their old daycare shut down quite a while ago and they finally found one but they can't get the kids in until July. Our family in the area all works full time so no one has been able to help much and my sister has had to take reduced hours and her husband took a different shift to accommodate their temporary schedule.\n\nAs we were chatting, my sister asked if my wife had found a job and I told her yes she has and she starts mid-June. My sister immediately brightened and said \"Oh! She can look after the kids while she is waiting to start.\" I immediately got uncomfortable and told my sister that wouldn't be possible and I wouldn't ask that of her.\n\nMy wife, even when she is at her best, is not one for kids. She doesn't enjoy being around them and they frustrate her easily. She is never mean to my sister's kids or anything, and she gives presents happily and easily, but she doesn't play with them and has never watched them on her own. \n\nMy sister is very offended by this and says I am wrong to not even ask her and just letting family struggle. I don't want to ask her because I know that she will say no but she will be bothered by the request and will dwell on it.

Watching three children is a lot of work!! Your sister is being ridiculous. You owe her no further explanation!!", "NTA\n\nI do think that it's wrong for you to answer for her though and that you should be discussing this with your spouse. Your family just shouldn't be pressing you about it and that is a far bigger issue.", "Nta, good job protecting her.", "I can tell this is already going to be filled with negative comments about people with kids, so I'm not gonna bother arguing with them. \n\nYou are NTA, but I'm curious if you guys ever plan on having kids in the future. I think it's important for anybody even considering kids to try to get used to watching them, learning how to care for them, and such. It's a useful skill that will come in handy if/ when you have kids. If you *don't* plan on ever having kids, that's a different story. \n\nIt's possible your wife is just hesitant around kids because she's never had to watch them before. My husband was the same way before we got married, but he wanted kids someday, and he knew I wanted kids, so he actively looked for opportunities for us to watch kids in low-pressure situations, just for practice. We even watched his sister's baby together while his sister and her husband did a run together. He was super nervous, but the child survived, and my husband gained confidence in that area. \n\nI feel for your sister, as she's in a tough spot, and if your family is pretty close, this can seem hurtful to her, especially when it seems like such a great solution to their temporary childcare problem.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
