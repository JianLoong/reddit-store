NTA.", "> didn't mean to upset them I just wanted people to think my dad still loved me.\n\nAdd that it hurts to think about it so you tell people he is dead so it doesn't hurt as badly, so you don't have to explain over and over again a VERY painful time. Be vulnerable and honest, it's the only option left and the best.", "YTA. Try to learn something like \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about that\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s not you business\u201d or \u201cMy parents are divorced and can we change the topic please\u201d or \u201cI didn\u2019t speak to my dad for last 4 years\u201d or something else that is true. \nThe truth is you feel very different in reality than if your lovely dad would be really dad. So imo it is okay to lie to strangers for that kind of questions but absolutely not okay to lie to your inner circle and close friends.", "NTA. maybe im only making this judgement because when i was younger than you i would do the same. it felt better than telling everyone my dad left. i stopped lying about it when i got into high school.\ni dont blame your friends for being mad at all. though if i were them i would choose to try understand WHY you did that in the first place. divorces fucking suck for everyone involved, especially the kids and there isnt really a wrong way to recover or move on from that. i would sincerely apologize but i would also make it known that you weren\u2019t comfortable talking to them about your parent\u2019s divorce and that your comfort about the whole thing is more important than them hearing the truth.", "I did the same thing as you OP. \n\nNAH\n\nIf someone finds out the truth just tell them as far as I'm concerned he's dead.", "NTA. I always wished my dad was dead too. But you guys are young and your friends probably just don\u2019t have enough life experience for more empathy. I\u2019d apologize and reconsider lying in the future.", "NTA.\n\nGet new friends who have empathy.", "NAH. You're 14 and you've obviously found it easiest this way to not discuss what really happened. Your friends are understandably upset at being lied to.\n\nApologise to them and tell them *why* you lied. It may get emotional, but they should understand and now the weight of the lie will be off your shoulders.\n\nHopefully everything works out for you. Remember: being honest means not having to hide and never being caught out lying.", "NTA - you are a kid and struggling with your dad leaving (sorry for that by the way).\nJust say to them, \u201cI am sorry for deceiving you. My dad left when I was 10, and it\u2019s hard for me to talk about. He is not in my life, and it\u2019s easier to say he died than to tell people he left my family.\u201d \n\nThey\u2019ll support you if they\u2019re good people.", "NTA. Our friends are not entitled to know everything about us, especially when you are young I would simply just say that it was a complicated situation and he\u2019s dead to you so the easiest way to explain it, without going into the whole backstory is to say that he was dead. Also that you were literally ten.  \n\nMy mother is schizophrenic and growing up. I didn\u2019t like explaining why things were the way they were and so I often said that she lived out of state if people I weren\u2019t close to asked. The problem with this is that you sometimes become close with those people and realize that the harmless lie has become an inconveniently large one. (I went to her place every other weekend so obviously they caught on) \n\nTbh\u2026.Theres no winning when a basic question uncovers deep wounds that you would rather not discuss. You dont have to always tell the truth to everyone about your dad but you should tell your friends at a certain point.", "NTA. My dad left me and my siblings.  If discussing my dad I say he\u2019s dead; he is dead to me. He may actually be dead, I don\u2019t know.  You\u2019re 14, you were 10 when he left- understand that you may not know why he left: but it *wasnt* because of you. I recommend talking to your mom about therapy. It\u2019ll help you process it and understand it\u2019s not your fault and not because he didn\u2019t love you.", "NAH \n\nMakes sense for you to lie about this but it also makes sense for them to be upset they were lied to. Perhaps, only if you're comfortable, explaining to them that the reality is super painful for you and it's easier on your psyche to lie would help them understand.", "Just say that he is dead to you.", "NTA.  Going forward, tell them that your dad is dead to you.", "NTA. Dead to you = dead.", "NTA. Everybody lies. Chances are every one of these friends has some secret themselves that would make me grow hair on my chest. It's not like this affects them. They need to get over themselves.", ">I just wanted people to think my dads still loved me\n\nJesus kid, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019d literally just say that to them and if they\u2019re decent people they\u2019ll understand. Sorry buddy, good luck \ud83c\udf40", "NTA", "Why lie?\n\nJudgement list so YTA.\n\nBut\u2026\n\nI had a so-called best friend, who lied about\u2026 everything. Once so found out, I felt manipulated, and could never trust her again.\n\nBe honest. \ud83d\ude33", "NTA but you really do need to have a serious conversation with your friends and just be honest with them. Tell them exactly how you felt and why you lied", "NTA I tell people my Dad is dead too, or I just say I don't have one. \n\nI would reach out to the friend you were closest to, or who you can talk to the easiest and explain the situation to them. If you can talk to one friend, they might be able to help with the others.", "NTA- he might be alive but he can be dead to you. F your friends, coz they don\u2019t seem to be a friend to you. Your truth is your truth.", "Nta he is dead to you and that is all that matters", "Do you hear from your dad? Why did you and your mom move to another state? Is your dad still living in the state you moved from?", "You're 14, and I wished I had learned this lesson I'm about to give you when I was your age.   \n\n\nJust be 100 on everything with your friends.  If they don't fuck with you because of what you tell them, they weren't going to be your friends that much longer anyways.   Always be yourself.   \n\n\nSo, in short, go tell your friends the truth.  You're insecure about some stuff to do with how you view your relationship with your father, and I'm gonna bet they all either understand or at least try.   If not, your friends ain't worth your time and you gotta make new ones.", "The only valid reason for people to Say you re NTA or NAH is because you're 14. And that's a valid reason. But let's be honest. You are hurt and unreasonably ashamed. It's not your fault your father left. But that doesn't justify lying. Your friends are rightfully angry at you. You're old enough not to play these stupid games for attention or whatever. I know this sounds rough, and you're only a kid, but don't lie to your friends man. They got you. Show some trust.", "I would address this with your mom and a therapist.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
