Your girlfriend should spend more of an effort to make you feel included in the main conversation and you should be more available so she does not feel neglected. It is more on her than on you as you are on unfamiliar ground.", "Your gf seems a little insecure over this.  Maybe she\u2019s been hurt in the past?
