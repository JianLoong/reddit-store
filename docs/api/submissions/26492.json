I give these to everyone regardless of gender.\n\nI\u2019ve probably given over 50 of these over the years and have never had anyone mention a concern to me. In fact, i\u2019m kind of notorious for this gift and have had grown ass adults ask for these for their birthdays. \n\nThis spring, I received a graduation announcement from one of the kids at our church. I don\u2019t know the parents well but have taken the kid on a couple of retreats. Because we were going to be out of town most of the summer, I brought the gift to church and left it with our minister (who is well aware of what is in the box) to give to the kid next time they attended.\n\nAnd then I forgot about it. Cause, life\u2026\n\nWe were gone most of the summer and when we returned a bunch f stuff happened and I still haven\u2019t been back to church.  While I was in Target today, I saw the mom. Waved hi, kept going. I had stuff to do. \n\nI\u2019m grabbing an item off the shelf and when I turn around, the mom is right in front of me. And she is pissed. \n\nShe starts in on me with that terse white woman whisper yelling: What was I thinking? How could I give such an offensive gift to her darling child? How could I call myself a Christian and condone sex for her child?\n\nMind you, this kid is at least 18. \n\nI was gobsmacked; a. because she chewed me out in a fucking Target and b. I gave that gift almost 3 months ago so she\u2019s been sitting on this mad for awhile.\n\nIn all the years I have given this gift I have never had this response. So should I stop giving this gift?\n\nEdit to clarify a few points:\n\n1. The condom packet contains three condoms and it is always at the bottom of the toolbox. I get them from the local health department. It\u2019s not a massive box of Trojans.\n\n2. I have had parents and recipients ask me about the condoms. They are included with the thought that you need the right tool for the job. And to always be safe. Prior to today, I have never had anyone express anger with my gift. \n\n3. Every box comes with a letter and each letter is individual to the recipient. I have to know someone pretty well before I give them a gift that on average costs me over $100. If I had any concerns about how the condoms would be received, I would definitely not include them in the box.\n\nThank you to those of you who read my entire post and responded in thoughtful and respectful ways.

You have no idea what each individuals relationship to sex/sexuality. There could be trauma. They could be ace. I personally would have been very uncomfortable if an acquaintance gifted me condoms - I'd be creeped out tbh.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like a fun gift, but you should probably do a second version without the condoms for kids from your church. I'd imagine a lot of heavily religious parents would react this way.", "Giving condoms as a gift to other people's kids (or other people in general) is really fucking weird.

Like that's just all sorts of weird.", "Yeah, probably don't give condoms to other people's teenaged kids.\n\nNAH though.", "NTA but you do seem a little clueless. Sex/sexuality is a private business and there are quite a few people who would not like being gifted condoms, myself included. I however probably wouldn't scold you but probably would distance myself from you. Educating someone about sex as a teacher is one thing, making an implication about their habits buy offering them a specific gift is another. You've said that you've never had such a reaction, that might have been because those people were too polite. While people may have a liberal attitude about not forcing other people to not conform to certain sexual norms, that doesn't mean that they don't conform to those norms in their own lives.", "Frankly, the condoms are a bit weird. Because you're making assumptions that the recipient of your gift will be sexually active in ways that involve a penis. I get where you're coming from, but not everyone has a sex life, and not everyone with a sex life has a penis in it.\n\nSo I'll give you a mild YTA.", "YTA.

They could be traumatized. Condoms could trigger them. They could be sex-repulsed.\n\nAnd this was for the kid's graduation, which they probably opened at their graduation party, where they were surrounded by family and friends.\n\nSex and sexuality are private things that not everyone is comfortable discussing with others.\n\nAnd then this kid has to pull condoms out of a toolbox in front of everyone at their party.\n\nThis is the kind of gift my dad would give his buddies, but not anyone else because it'd be inappropriate to do so. Especially not someone who is barely a legal adult.\n\nUltimately, you need to remove the condoms from the gift going forward. It's just not appropriate unless you are 100% sure they'd appreciate it **and** it's given to them in private so they don't open it in front of all their party guests.\n\n(Or, you know, start giving people gifts that reflect their interests instead of the same gift for everyone.

But stop being weird. Eww", "NTA\n\nI think that is an awesome gift. Sure, most recent grads would probably like something a little 'flashier' in the moment, but honestly, as a person who moved out at 18 and lived alone until 27, my toolbox and other random tool accessories have been one of the most handy things I own. Don't need them super often, but damn am I glad to have them for those times I couldn't fix a thing without them.\n\nAnd as for the condoms, I was also sent off to uni with some of those, never ended up needing them (I had a girlfriend instead), but just knowing I had them in case I met someone I might want to have sex with was reassuring, knowing I'd always be prepared.\n\nI think the mom was way off-base. Simply having condoms on hand doesn't mean you'll use them, and is certainly not some weird subliminal messaging that she seems to think it is. Your gift is perfectly suited for a fledgling adult.", "I think it\u2019s good for teens to have chill adults who they can talk to about \u201cless conservative\u201d things.

So I think it\u2019s fine. \n\nAlso at most colleges I\u2019m aware of, which most high school graduates might go to, they give out a lot of free condoms at most of their events, it\u2019s normal to start seeing them around that age. \n\nMaybe you can get both male and female condoms?

By focusing on the \"right tool for the job\" you are reminding kids to be prepared for anything. I'd just throw in Duck Tape and WD-40, also ensuring that everyone knows how important it is to use your tools correctly. I know it's not usual, but condoms can carry water in an emergency as well as be used as a tourniquet if need be. Maybe include a list of suggested items and how they could be used in a pinch?

What point are you trying to make here.  You don't leave the condoms out because the toolbox and tools are just window dressing for what you think is such a clever, tongue in cheek, wink wink gift.
