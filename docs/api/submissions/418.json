Amanda likes to bully/play pranks on me and her siblings. For example, once she hided her brother\u2019s notebook under his sheets, and when he lied on his bed and broke the notebook, she claimed it was just a funny prank.\n\nTwo weeks ago my uncles enrolled all their children in a beginner chess course, and Amanda can easily beat her younger siblings, since they are 12, 11 and 8 years old. Today Amanda was bragging about her chess skills, like she was a Grandmaster. She was being so annoying that even her siblings asked her to shut up.\n\nWhen I tried to change the conversation topic, Amanda literally said I was jealous of her and challenged me to a chess game, she also propose a bet, where the loser of the game would have to dye her hair blue. I questioned her about what dye would we use, and she told me she had bought a blue hair dye during the week, in other words, she had previously planned to take advantage of me because she assumed I didn't knew how to play chess.\n\nIn order to teach Amanda a lesson, I accepted the bet. We recorded the whole game, so if the loser refused to pay the forfeit, she would be exposed as a coward. Amanda didn\u2019t last more than 20 moves against me, and after her defeat she reluctantly agreed to dye her hair.\n\nAmanda\u2019s parents know I play chess with my mom since I was 9 (my mom is a better than average player), so after they found out why theirs daughter hair was blue, they started berating me, and demanded my parents grounded me because I had exploited Amanda\u2019s innocence. They are such hypocrites, since Amanda intended to do the same with me, and if the roles were reversed, they wouldn't punish her.\n\nMy parents think I'm little wrong, because two wrongs don't make a right, but due to Amanda being 15, they think she knew what she was doing, and therefore I don't deserve to be punished.\n\nHowever, I can't help but feel sorry for her now, what if our classmates start to make fun of her hair? The dye is permanent. I thought about dying my hair as well, as a gesture of solidarity, but I don't have the courage to do it.

It would be the a perfect repentance for the mistake made, is temporary  in the grand scheme of things, demonstrates a compassion and courage that will last a lifetime, and comes with a cool story. \n\n(IMPORTANT! Don't try to dye it yourself! Get your family to throw down if you don't have the $150 for a professional. Understand that it's going to take a couple months. Also note; I'm not really a fan of blue hair))\n\nNTA", "Yeah...she vastly overestimated her skills and was clearly relishing the chance to publicly humiliate you, now she gets to have herself a big old blue-colored piece of humble pie.", "And Amanda  is the one who proposed  the bet and challenged you. NtA", "Amanda has a very high opinion of herself and really did see herself as an amazing chess player.  And she had the premeditated plan to purchase the dye.  If Amanda\u2019s parents want to blame someone it should be Amanda.  Kind of nice to see her out into her place a little.  Don\u2019t dye your hair blue OP. This is a good lesson for Amanda to learn.  NTA.", "And there are several tales saying that a safe bet (like a rabbit challenged to a race by a tortoise) might still fail.", "OP \u2b06\ufe0f she seems incredibly manipulative and you need to tell her parents she bought the dye already and also - in my culture blue hair is fine will your school not allow it?", "The notebook casing was made of plastic. According to my cousin she left it opened in an 180 angle, so the screen broke.", "a notebook in this case is a laptop", "If she didn't we would have sent the recording to our friends, so it's not like she did it completely out of her good will. I was the one who suggested to record everything, because otherwise she would have chicken out. I'm feeling bad for her.", "This was exactly the thought I had. She wanted to dye her hair but didn't want parents to get mad so how does she shift blame? Force someone else to have made her do it. Even though she wanted to all along. \n\nDo not take the fall for her scheme. You did nothing wrong and she is trying to trap you. Manipulative adults will try to do similar things in the future unfortunately. You need to see them for what they are and refuse to take responsibility for their actions. You have no reason to do anything but shrug your shoulders and say \"her choices where hers, and she made them before I came along.\"", "The chances of Amanda being a chess prodigy are low, but never zero.", "If she didn't dye, we would have shared the \"insurance\" recording to our classmates and she would be known as a coward.", "Thanks!\n\nThis \"rule\" will live rent free on my head for the next months, LOL.\n\nEnglish isn't my first language.", "She only had herself to blame \ud83c\udfb5", "I was thinking a smurf.", "My bad, I meant classmates, English isn't my first language and another redditor already had corrected me.", "My bad, English isn't my first language, we use the same term for classmates and coworkers, LOL.", "And had the dye all ready so she had every intention of making YOU dye your hair. You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes. \n\nNTA- (and I absolutely despise \u2018pranksters\u2019- it\u2019s just another term for bullying and humiliation. I\u2019m glad she reaped what she sowed)", "And didn't even bother to ask about OP's skill level before proposing the bet. It's so silly that it almost feels like something out of a sitcom. Either the archetypal bully who was so full of hubris that they brought on their own downfall, or, she \\*wanted\\* to dye her hair blue all along, bought the dye, but knew her parents would flip out so she came up with the bet as an excuse (\"I couldn't help it, I lost a bet!\")", "she also had already purchased permanent blue hair dye. premeditated the whole thing. or you did when you made up and wrote this story for your colleagues.", "I really hope she was made to pay for a replacement. When I read your post, I thought you were referring to a book notebook rather than a notebook tablet.", "Ah, on second thought, don't tell that AH she can re-dye. :))))", "That's mean. What a vandal.", "Yeah, that makes the cousin a bigger AH", "That recording is called insurance. Now it's a video she could review to improve her game. Don't be surprised if she thinks twice before proposing a bet with you in the future.  Hope she learned a lesson that bragging can have consequences.", "Dont feel bad, she put herself in this position, she had no problem doing it to you, her arrogance got her into this", "You need to change your mindset. She brought the dye knowing it was permanent. She wanted to dye her hair blue but knew her parents wouldn't approve so she made a scenario where she got to do what she wanted and her parents wont be mad at her. They would laugj because she lost a bet. Which she purposefully lost so she could dye her hair knowing they wouldnt let her. Go back to apologise for your part in her plan and say THAT to her parents and yours. \n \nIf she disputes it she is admitting to trying to force you to dye your hair. Either way she planned out the whole thing. She brought the dye. She challenged you, she knew someone was going to have blue hair. And you both agreed to do it.", ">because otherwise she would have chicken out\n\nSmart, don't put yourself in a situation where you would follow through with the consequences but you opponent might not.", "You're a very kind person, but think of it this way: it's kinder for Amanda to fuck around and find out at 15, when the consequences are going to school with blue hair, than it would be for her to keep on thinking she's the smartest person in the room until she gets catfished and robbed of all her money at 30.\n\nI mean.  She may not learn from this experience.  But it's very kind of you to offer her the opportunity.", "I thought this too.\n\nLol the cousin is a piece of work. Got everything she wanted and a scapegoat to pin it on.", "She still had the choice.", "XD all good, normally I leave grammar and spelling because Im dyslexic and am not the best any of it but literally other then that one word you did amazingly!!!", "\n\nOooor she wanted her hair died blue (hence already purchasing the die) but just wanted someone else to take some of the blame from her parents.", "Seriously. Blue hair dye is hard as hell to take. It requires the hair to be bleached until it is basically white, otherwise it'll turn green.", "The parents llok like enablers. I am sure that her brother got yelled at.", "I think all she wanted was to embarrass me, after she lost, she didn't seem happy about it. However, maybe she is a better actress than I thought.", "Ahhh, the real grandmaster?", "Entirely possible. Especially if the parents are the type who wouldn\u2019t let her. She may have found a runaround.", "I was gonna say, blue hair is cool. This isn\u2019t like she had to shave her head or anything. She can dye it a different color any time.", "this could be it", "I've never had a hard time with blue or known anyone who had a hard time with it (other than getting it out) if she has blond hair then the blue would take really easily and not turn greenish at all", "I have to disagree here. I have medium golden brown hair. I dyed my hair sapphire blue this spring to cover my white hairs, no prep except for wash with a purifying shampoo to remove any residue. \n\nI'm still waiting for it to fade out so I can do something different.", "Maybe it depends on where you are? But at least in America, I\u2019ve never heard of teens getting made fun of for dying their hair. I dyed my tips or streaks and constantly got complimented and many were jealous because their parents wouldn\u2019t allow it.\n\nSo regardless of if it\u2019s truly an act I really don\u2019t think you need to worry about bullying. And honestly? She\u2019s literally a bully. How many people has she been cruel to? They didn\u2019t get to choose to make a losing bet like she did, they just get bullied regardless", "I have naturally blonde hair and blue has always faded to green for me and stayed green permanently if I didn't redye it BUT I have always used semi permanent dye not permanent.", "If you toss some silver in there that solves that problem. It will help fade it to grey instead", "Hmm weird. That sucks you constantly had to redye it. Mine always was able to nicely fade to a pale blue. I've used semi permanent and permanent dyes. Have you at least found a nice one that fades to a pretty green?", "Thanks!!", "Pink takes really nicely in my hair and sticks around forever, but blues fade on me super fast. My bf is exactly the opposite, even if we use the same dyes. It's super weird!", "Red tones fade soooo quickly for me. We are opposites lol"]}
