I\u2019m ignoring the will part because it seems pretty clear cut on who those items belong to legally. \n\nI\u2019m more curious on what the situation was while they were together and how much his kids were a part of his life. It\u2019s so sad to see family crawl out of the woodwork when someone dies because they stand to inherit. A family friend had to deal with her next door neighbor\u2019s kids showing up and contesting the revised will of the neighbor because he\u2019d changed it from the kids getting everything to the friend being the sole heir. He was of sound mind when the will was changed and everything had been filed correctly, so fortunately all it did was waste everyone\u2019s time. Friend had no idea about the change until the attorney contacted her. His reasoning was that his kids almost never contacted him while the friend brought him into her family and took care of him after his wife passed - did all of the yardwork, cleaned his house, drove him anywhere he needed to go, invited him for dinner every night, etc.\n\nI would say that while you have no obligation, take a long, hard look at your father\u2019s time with his gf as well as yours when deciding what to do.

No, no she does not. Your instinct is right, these are items she knows are valuable, because if she never moved in with him, I can't imagine she sees that silver bowl and says \"Of Frank loved that bowl and we used to take it on picnics all the time.\" And that's why I wouldn't give her the watch either.

So her asking for only 10k worth of items is honestly a really low ask compared to what would\u2019ve happened otherwise.\n\nMoral: This woman clearly loved and cared for your father and he cared for her enough that they fully intended on marrying. Denying her the right to get something sentimental because you plan on using it for money is incredibly selfish.

You don\u2019t know whether these items have sentimental value for her or not.  You *do* know that *your* interest is purely mercenary.

That doesn't make sense...  you said his death was sudden...  what exactly was he planning to live on?  He doesn't have retirement accounts or any other source of funds?", "Maybe ask her why she's asking for these two specific things. I agree with the idea of giving her the right of first refusal to purchase the items, especially if you're going to sell them. But it's not like this was a passing relationship, it was 3 years and he proposed to her. No, you have no obligation to give her anything, but giving her something is the morally right thing to do.", "Has she even been able to help? Sounds like she\u2019s being shut out by his family.", "That\u2019s so sad. Nephew\u2019s lawyer was probably sleazy and persistent enough that nephew got a payout just to get him to go away. \n\nFamily friend considered doing the same, but was told the family gave up when they realized there wasn\u2019t enough there to warrant an expensive legal battle. Family friend was very relieved because she  and her husband had already put a lot of work into the house when the neighbor was still alive to make it more accessible for him, and her mother had reached the point that she couldn\u2019t live on her own anymore, so finding out that she was inheriting the accessible house next door to her was a huge weight off of her mind.", "Three years is technically several yes. They were engaged because she wouldn't marry him.", "I actually find his watch more likely to be sentimental than the bowl. Maybe she bought for him, or he always wore it, or even it was her favorite of the ones he wore. And she could wear it or just keep it in her jewelry box to remember him.", "He earned a lot, but he also spent a lot. He liked treating people around him to dinners and days out. He's always been like this. His two divorces also took a sizeable bite out of him. He had several pensions, and the biggest of them is locked after his death. It\u2019s of course a pity as it's a lot of money, but it\u2019s also just that - money.", "I use to work in a paperweight store and we\u2019d sell some that were 10k and up. Not a lot of them of course, but people did buy them. One paperweight was auctioned for over 200k, so if anyone is cleaning out grandma\u2019s house and finds a paperweight, get it appraised.\n\nEdit: spelling", "Especially enough that the ex wife \u201cmisses it\u201d", "My family forgot to check the curtain hems at my Grandma's. We know for a fact that she sometimes hid stuff there, so who knows what was lost. We definitely have not seen most of her jewelry.", "That's how I read it too.", "It could be, and most likely is for that price, a decorative item that was in a common area. Maybe it sat in the living room holding his keys or candy or any little thing like that. It could be hand engraved with something that meant something to him.\n If his first wife wants it too without the intent to sell it I assume it means something and is beautiful at the least.\n\nEdit: one of the most argued about things for one estate I dealt with was a painting. It meant everything to everyone involved apparently because it had meant something to the one who owned it. It wasn't by some famous artist, wasn't of some big landscape, it just meant something to them so everyone wanted it. It was odd.", ">like a tiny, egocentric fruit bowl\n\nI love, love, love that multiple people want this thing.", "\"Tiny, egocentric fruit bowl\" is such a great description. Kudos.", "& funny AF!\n\nI don't own taxidermy but I would PAY for a dead budgie tea party!", "U get extras", "I mean...  girlfriend has gotten over $100k in gifts previous to this, and is independently wealthy...   and refused to marry him until he dealt with his hoarding issues (if she was just after his money she wouldn't have waited), I doubt she's in it for a silver bowl.\n\nIt may be \"worth\" $10k, but you don't just sell a $10k bowl for cash on Craigslist.  If she actually wanted to get some money for it, it would need to go to auction, probably wait 6 months for an appropriate opportunity, pay fees to the auction house, etc.  It's \"value\" and what she'll actually get for selling it are very different things.\n\nIf the father really had a 9! bedroom apartment, which is presumably being sold with the proceeds going to the children, it seems like they're each going to be walking away with $2-400k each, and that doesn't count his more liquid assets...  if he's gifting his girlfriend $100K worth of stuff (presumably a car is in there somewhere), and we was planning on living quite a bit longer (OP said the death was sudden), he presumably had a retirement portfolio to support those types of gifts...\n\nso the 3 kids are going to walk away with possibly half a million each...  if the girlfriend gets either the watch, or the bowl, that's $6-8k of money after a sale, split 3 ways between them...  so they're fighting over $2,00-2,500 each?  When they most likely are getting several hundred thousand each, on the low end...\n\nsounds to me like it's the kids who are in it to emotionally hurt the new girlfriend for giggles.  I don't believe either the kids or the girlfriend are motivated by money here.", "We've had 3 cats on separate occasions in the freezer.\n\nThey have a tendency to die at very inconvenient times, like when the ground is frozen solid or we're away on vacation.", "Or, he was trying to keep up with his rich girlfriend by spending money he really didn't have to spend. It's always weird when people start counting other people's money like you did. If the kids wanted to give a big FU to the girlfriend I'm sure they'd have a few stories on her to add to their case for telling her no. I come from a long line of men who made financial decisions with the wrong head. Luckily dad got all the good sense in the family and stopped that particular trend. I watched my grandfather promise and spend away money to women who got all their wealth gleaning it from the men they dated. It actually totally tracks that she wouldn't move into that hoarding situation and was content to receive financial gifts. It could just as easily be a situation of her taking advantage as the kids being vindictive as you say. Either way, let the wife that is actually attached to the weird bowl and had to live with it have it.", "If you\u2019re going to write paragraphs of assumptions maybe read OP\u2019s comments first. Then you\u2019d know the (9 room, probably not 9 bedroom) apartment is rented. No one is getting half a mil. The entire estate is estimated at $100K. After 40% going to taxes, well, a $10K bowl is a significant portion.", "She chose\u2026 poorly.", "\ud83d\udc80"]}
