I\u2019m ignoring the will part because it seems pretty clear cut on who those items belong to legally. \n\nI\u2019m more curious on what the situation was while they were together and how much his kids were a part of his life. It\u2019s so sad to see family crawl out of the woodwork when someone dies because they stand to inherit. A family friend had to deal with her next door neighbor\u2019s kids showing up and contesting the revised will of the neighbor because he\u2019d changed it from the kids getting everything to the friend being the sole heir. He was of sound mind when the will was changed and everything had been filed correctly, so fortunately all it did was waste everyone\u2019s time. Friend had no idea about the change until the attorney contacted her. His reasoning was that his kids almost never contacted him while the friend brought him into her family and took care of him after his wife passed - did all of the yardwork, cleaned his house, drove him anywhere he needed to go, invited him for dinner every night, etc.\n\nI would say that while you have no obligation, take a long, hard look at your father\u2019s time with his gf as well as yours when deciding what to do.

No, no she does not. Your instinct is right, these are items she knows are valuable, because if she never moved in with him, I can't imagine she sees that silver bowl and says \"Of Frank loved that bowl and we used to take it on picnics all the time.\" And that's why I wouldn't give her the watch either.

So her asking for only 10k worth of items is honestly a really low ask compared to what would\u2019ve happened otherwise.\n\nMoral: This woman clearly loved and cared for your father and he cared for her enough that they fully intended on marrying. Denying her the right to get something sentimental because you plan on using it for money is incredibly selfish.

You don\u2019t know whether these items have sentimental value for her or not.  You *do* know that *your* interest is purely mercenary.

If you father wanted her in his will, he had plenty of time to incorporate her; but he didn\u2019t. Maybe it\u2019s because of the condition she gave him about moving. I would not give those items to her. I wonder why a silver bowl\nIs something that she would \u201cremember him by\u201d??", "NTA.  If you have to, tell her sorry, but there's a prior claim to these items.  Then don't say any more.  If you check with the Estate Attorney about the will and ask if a non-beneficiary is entitled to any of your dad's property, you can say that this was **after** you'd researched about the two items and consulted the attorney.\n\nThree years is enough time to redraft a will or to add codicils.  To include some sentence to bequeath this lady a token of remembrance.\n\nYou children all have needs where the sale of these two items could help you out immensely.  This lady has accepted $33,333.33 in gifts for each year that she's dated your father.  As you said, she's financially well off.\n\nYou can offer her first chance to purchase these items at market cost (or slightly below).  But she is not entitled to the watch or silver bowl. It's suspicious that she'd pick exactly THE MOST EXPENSIVE belongings.\n\nOften, the most meaningful tokens of remembrance are photos or some small item tied to a shared experience.", "No, NTA.", "NO. she is a girlfriend ,not a wife . Unless she is given these items in his will she is SOL. Thank you for noticing they are the most valuable things in the estate. Lots of people do not see that- she clearly does. If your family wants to sell the items,rather than keep them, she can bid at the auction. NTA.", "NTA. If she said a favorite shirt of his or the coffee cup he used everyday, okay, why not. But something as expensive as that? No, it's not like he used that wristwatch to time himself in the sack with her or the silver bowl was used to wash her feet daily.", "NTA. You have no obligation to give her anything, and she has pictures and whatever else stuff he left in their shared place.", "NTA,\n\nI would offer to sell them to her if she truly wants them for sentimental reasons and is well off enough that it would be reasonable.", "NTA  these items cannot have a long standing sentimental attachment for her. It sounds as though she has an eye for the potential value. I hope you can find something meaningful for her to honour her kindness to your father. But from what you say she had financially benefited substantially from the relationship already.", "All of us siblings are close. Two of us were very close with our father, and one fell out with him years ago but had just started reconciling with him. \n\nHe was close with his girlfriend, but in a bachelor kind of way. They went on dates, he bought her lavish gifts, but they didn't stay over much at each other's places. \n\nAfter his death his two ex wives have helped out more with the planning and organising than she has (she hasn't helped at all).", "The part where OP admits their plans to sell the items without second thought is what does it for me. Regardless of OPs perception of the dads love life that women is basically a widower. Her fianc\u00e9 died. We also don\u2019t know that they never would\u2019ve moved in together. I grew up in a hoarder home, it takes years to undue the type of clutter both physically and emotionally. Just because the dad couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it yet doesn\u2019t mean he wouldn\u2019t have been dedicated to her.", "We don't know that he would have changed his will.  He is a twice divorced man with three grown children.  Most people who marry later in life sign prenups because we want the assets that we have accumulated over our lifetime to go to our children.  I think if he intended to change his will, he would have done so when he got engaged.", "We will only sell them if we all agree. If one of us wants the items and the others don\u2019t, we'll agree to buy the other two out.", "No she doesn\u2019t have an \u201cemotional\u201d attachment to a bowl and a watch, it\u2019s obviously for the money", "Everyone wants the bowl!\n\nThis will take some time, but everything has to be sorted and appraised. When sold, the assets are to be split, I assume, amongst his children.", "On top of changing the locks, get a good appraiser for your father's estate.  I'm sure part of the reason why your father didn't have the energy to move out is due to the value of his collection and how best to handle them. (provenance and authenticity of items, etc. can make or break a price, but I'm sure you already thought of this.)", "Make sure if you find any books or magazines you flip through the, to make sure there\u2019s nothing hidden in them. When my hoarder neighbor died his family found over a half a million in cash stashed in magazines, newspapers, books, documents, etc\u2026", "Sounds like your mother should have it, and if she actually owned it I would think it has more sentimental value to her than the girlfriend.  Just because she (the girlfriend) was most recently in his life doesn\u2019t mean she had a greater attachment and is therefore more deserving of the items she wants than someone who was actually his wife and had a family with him.\n\nFor those who are saying that he wanted to marry her: well apparently not that much.  Also, on her end, what\u2019s up with that weird ultimatum requiring him to get rid of his apartment for him to be marriage-worthy?  If you really want to marry someone, you marry them, you don\u2019t hamstring things with red tape.\n\nI also want to point out that older people who have been there, done that are often not quite so discriminating and emotionally driven about marriage as younger people - companionship and compatibility are often the main goal and love is not a major factor.\n\nAnother thing I see is that you might consider deferring to her wishes because she was his girlfriend,  but she had a relationship with him for three years and you and other members of your family had a relationship with him for decades.", "Were these things the girlfriend/fiance even had access to in every life with him? If not I wouldn't understand why she would pick those specific items other than out of greed.", "Offer to give the girlfriend something not too valuable from the estate, a different bowl or something similar that doesn't really have any monetary value. That will clearly show you if she really just wants something to remember your father by, or if she just wants the most valuable items. To me it feels like the latter is the case, but it would be interesting to see her reaction to being offered something that has no monetary value.", "Well, to keep the preface she could always but it if you auction the stuff.", "Just to cover yourself, you could \"sell\" this silver bowl for a nominal price, like $5.", "If your mother was originally joint owner and would like yo buy it off you she has much greater claim than the girlfriend that wasn't even put in the will", "You could also along with stating your intent to sell the items, offer her the opportunity to buy them,", "It sounds like there\u2019s plenty of other stuff for you to sell, though. Perhaps you could give her one of them, since she saved you a lot by not marrying him more promptly.", "Small discount on the price then. Maybe a buy one, get one 20% off or something.", "I mean wether or not he would change it again depends on a few things we don\u2019t know such as their relationship and their ages. Regardless of that I think it\u2019s relatively safe to assume they\u2019d act as a standard married couple and she\u2019d at least get something, cause currently she\u2019s getting absolutely nothing.", "A watch is a pretty sentimental piece for some people. It\u2019s like an engagement ring for men.", "I really need to see what a $10k bowl looks like that is so coveted.", "Whatever you do with grungy metal items, DON'T polish them!  *Antiques Roadshow* had someone who shined up an old Tiffany lamp. Which reduced the value to maybe one-quarter of what it could have fetched at auction.  :-(\n\n\"Patina\" is part of the pedigree and high price. Very it looking like something you just got out of the box from an internet store.", "Don't forget to check shoes, the freezer and coat pockets. \n\nMost people just toss those items, you'd be surprised how often someone finds a $20 in a second hand coat.", "My grandmother has been building her book collection since she was a teen eager.  Oh let me read this old Agatha Christie, 500 dollars falls out that my Pop Pop stashed in it.  \n\nHe\u2019s still alive so he picks a new book and it\u2019s a fun surprise for everyone", "Yeah a safety deposit box or somethin similar where you need 2 keys would be the best best imo. That way no one person can claim it for whatever reason until it\u2019s all sorted out since this seems to be a very sticky situation for OP and their family", "OP has clarified that it\u2019s rented but lots of places around the world use the word apartment for rentals and purchases.", "A 3 bedroom apartment in my city is at least a million. I cannot fathom how expensive a 9 bedroom place would be.", "Eh, you're fine. I do that shit all the time.", "If you look up Tiffany silver bowl, you\u2019ll find some ranging from 1k-80k", "Literally my first thought", "Even a used one is $6k. They're insanely expensive.", "Sure, but she said they could use the watch/bowl money to help pay for a wedding. If he owned the property, why would she say that? Surely the apartment would be worth more than $20k.", "I'm making assumptions, but in the US, apartments are, by and large, rentals. Not sure if OP is in the US tho.\n\nAnd I'm concluding when OP said the watch and bowl are the most expensive items he owns and they could use the money for a wedding that the property was not his.", "In the US, at least apartments are by and large typically rentals. And if the father owned the *apartment house whatever*, she wouldn't have said the watch/bowl was the most expensive things he owned, and they could really use the money to help pay for a wedding. Why would she say that if she stood to get a huge chunk of what sounds like a massive apartment?", "Apartments in the US are generally only owned in places like Manhattan, where owning a house is extremely unlikely. For most of the country apartment indicates a rental.", "Plus, she said the watch and bowl are the most valuable things he owns, and she could use the money to help pay for her son's wedding. If he owned the apartment, surely that would be worth more than the $20k for the bow/watch.", "Fair enough, I suppose it must be a fairly big apartment if it has 9 rooms. \nBut where I live you can get a really big house for a million, but my fault for making assumptions", "Fair enough, I suppose it must be a fairly big apartment if it has 9 rooms. \nBut where I live you can get a really big house for a million, but my fault for making assumptions", "Fair enough, I suppose it must be a fairly big apartment if it has 9 rooms. \nBut where I live you can get a really big house for a million, but my fault for making assumptions", "I mean it's not a 9 *bedroom* apartment, it has 9 rooms in total", "I once worked with a guy who got a paper published with brain spelled brian in the title, the abstract, and about 30% of the times in the article text. Nobody  noticed until after it was published.

I was just pointing out apartment could cover condo as a term.", "But someone has to own an apartment for it to be rented, right? And it's pretty difficult to have a house in a city. Especially in places like US, where there is almost no historical tissue like old houses.", ">but my fault for making assumptions\n\nMine too since OP clarified to me  that it is indeed rental and not owned \ud83d\ude01", "Ok. It\u2019s still a 9 ROOM apartment and those are very hard to come by in any city without being expensive. My point still stands.", "Oh man! The initial shock would be unbearable.", "Or you could just say, \"Okay, yeah, that makes sense. It sounds like it's a rental\"... lol.", "In the US, apartment refers to a unit in an overall building, generally that building is owned by one owner. Individually owned units are generally part of what are called \"co-ops\" or \"condos\", these have different tax/zoning statuses than apartment buildings overall do. \n\nRegarding US historical tissue, while settlements only started \\~400 years ago, that's still well before most countries in the world had residential zoning laws to begin with, so it's not really relevant.", "Yeah fair enough, I'm happy to admit I may well be wrong about this.
