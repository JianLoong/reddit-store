I\u2019m ignoring the will part because it seems pretty clear cut on who those items belong to legally. \n\nI\u2019m more curious on what the situation was while they were together and how much his kids were a part of his life. It\u2019s so sad to see family crawl out of the woodwork when someone dies because they stand to inherit. A family friend had to deal with her next door neighbor\u2019s kids showing up and contesting the revised will of the neighbor because he\u2019d changed it from the kids getting everything to the friend being the sole heir. He was of sound mind when the will was changed and everything had been filed correctly, so fortunately all it did was waste everyone\u2019s time. Friend had no idea about the change until the attorney contacted her. His reasoning was that his kids almost never contacted him while the friend brought him into her family and took care of him after his wife passed - did all of the yardwork, cleaned his house, drove him anywhere he needed to go, invited him for dinner every night, etc.\n\nI would say that while you have no obligation, take a long, hard look at your father\u2019s time with his gf as well as yours when deciding what to do.

No, no she does not. Your instinct is right, these are items she knows are valuable, because if she never moved in with him, I can't imagine she sees that silver bowl and says \"Of Frank loved that bowl and we used to take it on picnics all the time.\" And that's why I wouldn't give her the watch either.

So her asking for only 10k worth of items is honestly a really low ask compared to what would\u2019ve happened otherwise.\n\nMoral: This woman clearly loved and cared for your father and he cared for her enough that they fully intended on marrying. Denying her the right to get something sentimental because you plan on using it for money is incredibly selfish.

You don\u2019t know whether these items have sentimental value for her or not.  You *do* know that *your* interest is purely mercenary.
