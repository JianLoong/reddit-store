I am constantly stuck in a mindfuck of thinking I'm being a horrible daughter then realising I'm being gaslit by a narcissistic parent. My ED behaviours stemmed from my childhood.  She body shamed me in front of relatives during holiday gatherings to 'motivate' me to lose weight. And it snowballed into many other disorders. I'm tired of having to point out what she did wrong and then have her manipulate me into thinking I'm being mean to her. We tried counselling once, years ago. She went there as a 'concerning parent of a troubled teen' and she did not participate in any discussions because there was 'nothing wrong with her'. But thank you I know you mean well x", "Exactly.

I feel seen for once. Even posting on Reddit where she will NEVER be on, I still held myself back on details in case it would make her sound too horrible. I\u2019ve been programmed to prioritise her reputation over my own well being since I was a kid. When I started seeing a therapist and taking SSRIs in college, she DEMANDED me to keep it a secret, in case our extended family knows about it and gossip about us. I spent one Christmas at my best friend\u2019s house and it was like a fairytale. I had never seen a healthy family first hand before, only in movies. I cried on the last day because I wanted my best friend\u2019s mum to adopt me. She treated me 1000 times better than my own."]}
