I am constantly stuck in a mindfuck of thinking I'm being a horrible daughter then realising I'm being gaslit by a narcissistic parent. My ED behaviours stemmed from my childhood.  She body shamed me in front of relatives during holiday gatherings to 'motivate' me to lose weight. And it snowballed into many other disorders. I'm tired of having to point out what she did wrong and then have her manipulate me into thinking I'm being mean to her. We tried counselling once, years ago. She went there as a 'concerning parent of a troubled teen' and she did not participate in any discussions because there was 'nothing wrong with her'. But thank you I know you mean well x", "Exactly.

I feel seen for once. Even posting on Reddit where she will NEVER be on, I still held myself back on details in case it would make her sound too horrible. I\u2019ve been programmed to prioritise her reputation over my own well being since I was a kid. When I started seeing a therapist and taking SSRIs in college, she DEMANDED me to keep it a secret, in case our extended family knows about it and gossip about us. I spent one Christmas at my best friend\u2019s house and it was like a fairytale. I had never seen a healthy family first hand before, only in movies. I cried on the last day because I wanted my best friend\u2019s mum to adopt me. She treated me 1000 times better than my own.", "Hey op,\n\nLeaving other people to say nta and your mum is selfish and cruel in her actions and words towards you.\n\nI am giving you the biggest biggest hug I can through the phone.  You've done incredible work to make it through to where you are.  The bad days and the continual effort are all impressive and a testament to your strength, even when you feel like you might be weak.  It's worth it for living well and everything you have to do to protect your headspace is valid and worth it - up to and including taking every measure you need to get your mum out of your life if she is not contributing to your recovery.\n\nLet go of those clothes you don't need - NOT to your mum where you'll see them on her.  Take them to a secondhand/thrift/charity shop you don't go to and release them into the void where they're not taking up space in the back of your mind.  I can't tell you the surge of relief I felt getting rid of things associated with Bad Times, even the things I really liked as individual objects that just happened to be tangled up in horrible memories.  It was so hard to do, and felt almost stupid, but it was so good I wished I'd done it so much sooner.\n\nI see you trying.  I see the progress, and how hard it's been in so many moments that nobody but you will ever really know.  I'm so so proud of you.  You deserve someone who cheers on your progress and nurtures your happiness and respects your wishes.  \n\nBest of luck, and big hugs sent from an internet stranger.", "NTA", "NTA.

Next stop - restraining order.", "No NTA, moms think they know best when it comes to weight and food. My sister had a ED for quite a few years she had belemia I believe. I witnessed it as a kid but never knew what she threw up all the time. She eventually became vegetarian and got her weight back to where it should be. My mom would make meat based dishes for years until she realized that vegetarians can actually get sick trying to eat meat after a while.

Hell, you could have said you moved because of her actions and my option still wouldn't have changed.\n\nNTA\n\nGood luck to you in your recovery.

Sorry for your loss.", "Figure yourself out....you can't starve yourself because your mom showed you old clothes.  It triggered you.

Maybe give her a shot months later and if she does the same thing know to go no contact permanently.\n\nEDIT:- per other comments she basically caused your ED (I suspected) by shaming you in front of others all your life, that's absolutely what she's still doing. I'd still drop an email and give her specifics just so you can feel like you've said your piece but I would stay no contact. I'd also (unless the apartment is perfect/cheap) try and move further away and not let her know where.", "NTA\n\nThe big issue isn't just that she used the \"emergency\" key for her own convenience, which is bad enough, nor that she rifled through your personal possessions, which is a huge violation. \n\nThe biggest flag here is that **she saw nothing wrong** with what she did. You can't fix that and you won't change her. She will drag you down every time you interact. Avoid her and get therapy if you can to help you learn strategies for that.", "Thank you so much. You have no idea how much your words helped \u2764\ufe0f", "I have a hard time describing her without sounding like I'm trying to villainize her on purpose. Let's say she gave my brothers and I a lot of trauma. Her parents used to beat her and she thinks the way she raised us was 'heaven to her childhood hell', and we should be forever grateful. Our beating only stopped when all three of us became taller than her.\n\nIronically the mental abuse left me more traumatised than physical. I struggle to have healthy romantic relationships. I self sabotaged and broke up with the most wonderful human being who I thought I was going to marry. When my ED was at its worst, her main concern was to hide it from our relatives. So I just didn't leave my house at all for months to hide myself.\n\nSorry for the info dump, really difficult to give a full picture in one post. I do go to therapy every week. The only issue I have atm is not having a mentor who personally went through EDs and stayed recovered for years. They are very hard to find.

Please take care of yourself and try to spend all kinds of holidays with people who cherish you and each other.", "This reminds me of my mom a lot. She had a meltdown when she finally realized (i had to tell her) i was self harming. And then lost it when I went on SSRIs too. We're on better terms now but if I ever bring up some bullshit she used to do back in the day (i think the correct term is abuse), she gets so upset that I can't just forget about it... I wish I could, mom. Wish I could.", "There's a community on Tik Tok of adult children estranged from abusive parents who are posting videos for support and validation, telling their experiences.

I promise you, she *does understand* what she did wrong, she keeps pushing all your buttons and boundaries and knows for a fact that you are recovering from an eating disorder. Yet she still loves triggering them because it makes her feel better about herself. It's all about her and what she wants and nothing will change. \n\nI wouldn't even go see a therapist with her.
