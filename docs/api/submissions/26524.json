I collect Lego and so do my sons. Whenever his kids would visit they always wanted to play with my Lego so I started buying sets for them to have when they came over. I didn't want them messing with mine. \n\nSo I buy small Marvel or Star Wars or Disney sets and we build them together. We set up on the kitchen table and build together. I often mess with the sets on purpose. I will give a Disney princess a blaster or a Light Saber. Or I will switch out Gamora's hair for Rapunzel's. Just to play with the kids. Then we will get into a big long argument about why a princess might need weapons to take out the evil Queen or the Joker. \n\nIt's fun and the kids play along. The problem is that, like myself, my brother is ND. But I have had a lot of counseling and have developed lots of mechanisms to cope with life. He hasn't. He is very rigid like our father was. \n\nHe will come into the kitchen while we are playing and complain about me switching out Boba Fett for Iron Man. He will get really upset about it and has even just packed up the sets so they \"can build them correctly at home\". \n\nAfter the first time he did that I didn't buy them sets for two visits. And I locked my stuff away so that they couldn't see it. He asked me why I didn't get his kids something to play with and I said entertaining his kids wasn't my job. He got mad at me and said his kids never play with him like they do with me. I said that's because he doesn't really play. He just follows the instructions and nothing else. I told him to go to the store and grab a set and we could build it together. \n\nHe tried but he got frustrated when I added some flowers to an X-wing \"for color\". He said I was being stupid and he wanted it to look right. I told him to get out of the kitchen and let me play my way. \n\nHe thinks I'm being an asshole for excluding him from activities with his kids. I think he needs help because he cannot understand his kids.", "created_utc": 1694271653, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16e7vi3/aita_for_telling_my_brother_to_leave_us_alone/", "score": 329, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That way, the kids can be creative, there aren't directions that your brother will feel have been \"messed up,\" AND you can reuse the same bricks every time the kids visit you.

But if you and the kids enjoy mixing up sets when playing with them - that's your fun, and your brother shouldn't be telling you you are doing it wrong, especially if they are your sets. \n\nAs far as excluding him from the play - people don't want to include someone who is going to tell them that their fun is wrong and is going to control everything.

They have more fun playing with Legos by doing free builds or imaginative play than just following the directions.  I have had people offer to get them Legos for birthdays and I just tell them up front that they need to be ok with the fact we may not build it the way intended. Or we may once and then take it apart. Our friends haven't cared but I know some people think Legos should only be played a certain way which is silly.", "As long as pieces aren\u2019t getting lost, there\u2019s nothing wrong with mixing up some sets. My young cousin likes to mix her Lego sets together sometimes, while other times she wants to build exactly what the instructions say. She was very disappointed when her shopping mall ended up missing some windows and floor tiles because those pieces had been lost during a previous play session. (I *did* help her look for the pieces, and I had found several other missing ones already.)", "NTA, by the way Legos with premade structures and instructions make sense to build some skills, but make me so sad. I grew up in the 90's with random Lego pieces and played building imaginary animals, buildings and structures. I had so much fun. Your approach for sure brings more creativity and a more relaxed approach to the game. Sounds like your brother is very rigid / narrow minded (possibly some OCD?) and a different approach is healthy for the kids.", "I played with Legos as a child in the 60s they were not about building a specific thing.  They were set of bricks to promote creative play.  It make me sad to hear people insisting on \"building it right\"", "NTA.

They need to be given things they are free to mess up, mix up, and personalize.", "Some kids do care. I definitely regretted letting clay colors mix (it wasn\u2019t deliberate, I was trying to copy a sculpture in a picture on the packaging that used multiple colors, and of course they cross contaminated) when I was a child.", "Unfortunately not, it sounds like if he was 12 it would actually help his cause. To clarify, because I am so sick and tired of people using acronyms everywhere on Reddit and just assuming we all know what they mean, OP says his brother is ND. No, his brother isn't North Dakota, he's neuro-divergent. Essentially both OP and his bro have autism to some degree. It sounds like bro doesn't bother getting any sort of help with this, unlike OP", "How am.i punishing the kids?", "Clay is not separable like Lego. One is made of discrete and solid material, the other is just malleable mush. I get your point, but that\u2019s not the situation here.", "But then they learn about mixing colors.", "I was wondering what that meant. Even did a google search but it makes more sense now.", ">After the first time he did that I didn't buy them sets for two visits. And I locked my stuff away so that they couldn't see it...I said entertaining his kids wasn't my job.", "Sure, that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t mention clay/PlayDoh until the person I was replying to brought it up. The only problem I\u2019ve ever had with young relatives mixing up Lego sets is when they lose pieces and then get disappointed when they DO want to follow the set directions and are missing the pieces they need. (I was able to find most of the lost pieces, but not all of them.)", "I think that\u2019s a fair boundary to make if their father is gonna pack up the sets and take them home. Is he just supposed to buy these sets endlessly?", "I'm protecting my property and not purchasing toys for his children. Which of those is punishment?", "\ud83d\ude05My bad. I\u2019m scrolling through Reddit because I can\u2019t sleep so I missed that.", "No problem! I\u2019ve been in your situation many times.", "NTA. Sounds like your brother hasn't learned the lesson that a lot of autistic people need to learn - that just because you strongly feel there is a right way of doing things, that doesn't mean other ways aren't equally valid and not everyone wants to minmax things. Usually tightly coupled with not fundamentally understanding how different other people are. \n\nIt may come down to explaining a safer/easier example of where opinions differ to help him understand that his kids don't feel the same as he does about mixing kits and it's a valid thing to do. Or sidestepping the issue with the grand ol' bucket of Lego that has no specific instructions, maybe mixing in some e.g. ship parts and the like if the kids have preferred things to build.", "NTA and this is kind of funny because we (my son and I) just watched a Muppet Babies episode yesterday where Sam the Eagle has a hard time dealing with people not following the exact pictures on boxes of building blocks. Maybe he can watch that episode and learn something lol.", "NTA: have your brother watch the Lego movie since the lesson is exactly what your brother is struggling with. While the son is having fun and doing whatever in the movie, the dad is just like him, wanting everything in it place.", "What is ND?", "NAH\n\nCan you buy smaller sets so his doesn't have flowers that don't belong?

You are NTA- if they are yours etc. But, shouldn\u2019t it matter more how the kids would like to use them?", "NTA - He's made it impossible to participate in these activities without ruining them for everyone else. He needs to see that his rigidity is the problem.", ">He said I was being stupid and he wanted it to look right.\n\nIt's not about making it look right. It's having fun while making it. Period.", "NTA. It\u2018s no wonder your brother\u2019s kids don\u2019t want to play with him if he\u2019s so rigid and controlling about The Right Way To Do Lego. I can absolutely see where it\u2019s coming from with his neurodivergence, and that\u2019s understandable - but his inflexibility is clearly creating problems with his relationship with his kids, and as an adult (and a parent!) he needs to take responsibility for that and seek solutions. Getting angry at you won\u2019t solve the problem, and will likely make things *worse* with his kids because they\u2019re old enough to realise that dad is blocking them from having a good time with their fun uncle.", "NTA and I\u2019m so sorry this is tough, sounds like you are a wonderful uncle and he\u2019s trying his best to be a good dad. Would it help if you made \u201crules\u201d for legos at your house? Even if they are fun ones like hairstyles must be changed, extra color welcome? Would that help him be mentally more flexible? Or could you suggest he drop the kids off for a couple hours and have time to himself while you enjoy the kids? Most parents would jump at the chance for that! You could certainly tell him how much therapy has helped you and suggest it for him but ultimately it\u2019s up to him to figure out how to connect with his kids and parent. They are lucky to have you in their life!", "NTA at all. Most kids don\u2019t like to follow every single correct direction while playing. Playing is supposed to be fun! Your brother sounds like he\u2019s not even trying to connect with his kids and just does what he wants to do.", "NTA.\n\nGet several of the old-school mixed sets that aren't associated with a copyrighted property. They do come with some instruction booklets, and you can buy books for more creative ideas.\n\nMix all the sets together in one big bin.\n\nMy guess is he won't have as much to complain about once he's not looking at a picture of an X-Wing - and this will give the kids more options too.", "NTA. He needs counselling, but I understand where he's coming from. I had a lego set once that my brother *loved* to take apart and build bits on to, and it pissed me right off. I'm ND too.", "I think you are right.\n\nI don't know that you telling him that therapy helped you open up and learn to play is going to work, but it should be said that the ability to play leads to lifelong curiosity and happier people.\n\nBest of luck!", "NTA. Send him to the McDonald's ball pit", "NTA. He's the only one complaining about the sets being mismatched. He reminds me of the Dad in the Lego Movie. It's not about the niblings having fun, it's about control for him. He needs to cut the crap.", "Especially something like PCIT! The first half of the (evidence based) treatment is teaching parents how to participate in child directed play to improve warmth and relationships", "The brother needs to watch the Lego Movie. OP over here just living his best life as a Master Builder while the brother is going all President Business on him. Better watch out OP, next time he may release the Kragle!", "Yeah! Half the time, my brothers and I never even made the ship or whatever.", "Neurodivergent, I had to scroll through to get it", "Neurodivergent :)", "This IS how the kids would like to use them. That's his entire point.", "Then maybe the brother shouldn't take the sets OP buys and let them stay at OP's place. Do you think it's okay if the brother contiually does this and OP has to waste their money on buying new sets every time?", "I follow the instructions. My Lego sets will look exactly like the last step of the book. I like it that way because I'm not really creative.\n\nMy husband and our daughter, however, are free spirits. They build their sets how they want. And I praise them for it. Because I love their way of thinking out of the box.\n\nOn a related note, Everything Is Awesome is on my favourites playlist.", "I was about to say that's LITERALLY what the Lego movie was about", "I\u2019m so sorry I literally missed that. Either way he\u2019s are NTA tho!", "No. I think it\u2019s weird that 2 adult parents haven\u2019t discussed this outside of the situation itself \n\nI think it\u2019s weird that the option was simply \u201cno more fun at my house\u201d as though the children were part of the problem.", ">I think it\u2019s weird that the option was simply \u201cno more fun at my house\u201d\n\nBc legos are the end all be all of fun? OP stopped buying legos and apparently has nothing else in their house that might be specifically for the niblings?", "Hi, I'm ND aswell, so hopefully this might have a bit more of an understanding.\nIt's great that you get on so well with your nephews, that's a lovely thing. It's great that yous have fun together.\nWith a lot of types of neurodivergency, you feel like you have to follow the rules. It depends on the type but you can feel just *off*, stressed out, or like somethimg bad is going to happen. This might be *might* be where your brother's head is at. \nIf you got a box of loose pieces, then there are no rules that anyone has to follow, and you can create anyway you want. I used to get stressed out of my head, when my brother built things wrong with instruction sets, but we got a big box of loose pieces, and I loved it, and built so much stuff, and planned out everything.", "I'm both a master builder and president business. I build the set correctly....but we also have gobs and gobs of bulk lego that can be whatever we want it to be. My son can do as he pleases with his lego but my sets need to be left alone. I also make MOCs. It's all subjective.", "Not the person you replied to, but the word \"punishment\" wasn't meant that literally here.  Your response to being upset with your brother is affecting the kids more negatively than it is your brother.  That doesn't mean you owe your nieces/nephews to look at your stuff or for you to buy them things.  You're right that it's not your job to entertain them.  It does mean that the kids are losing out on a fun activity with their uncle only because you are upset with their dad.  That's not really fair to them."]}
