I collect Lego and so do my sons. Whenever his kids would visit they always wanted to play with my Lego so I started buying sets for them to have when they came over. I didn't want them messing with mine. \n\nSo I buy small Marvel or Star Wars or Disney sets and we build them together. We set up on the kitchen table and build together. I often mess with the sets on purpose. I will give a Disney princess a blaster or a Light Saber. Or I will switch out Gamora's hair for Rapunzel's. Just to play with the kids. Then we will get into a big long argument about why a princess might need weapons to take out the evil Queen or the Joker. \n\nIt's fun and the kids play along. The problem is that, like myself, my brother is ND. But I have had a lot of counseling and have developed lots of mechanisms to cope with life. He hasn't. He is very rigid like our father was. \n\nHe will come into the kitchen while we are playing and complain about me switching out Boba Fett for Iron Man. He will get really upset about it and has even just packed up the sets so they \"can build them correctly at home\". \n\nAfter the first time he did that I didn't buy them sets for two visits. And I locked my stuff away so that they couldn't see it. He asked me why I didn't get his kids something to play with and I said entertaining his kids wasn't my job. He got mad at me and said his kids never play with him like they do with me. I said that's because he doesn't really play. He just follows the instructions and nothing else. I told him to go to the store and grab a set and we could build it together. \n\nHe tried but he got frustrated when I added some flowers to an X-wing \"for color\". He said I was being stupid and he wanted it to look right. I told him to get out of the kitchen and let me play my way. \n\nHe thinks I'm being an asshole for excluding him from activities with his kids. I think he needs help because he cannot understand his kids.", "created_utc": 1694271653, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16e7vi3/aita_for_telling_my_brother_to_leave_us_alone/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your brother\u2019s refusal to learn and controlling approach to play make him TA.\n\nAlso, my favorite thing as a kid was mixing up my lego sets and making new things with them. Building just the things in the instructions was boring.", "NTA. If he saw that his children didn't play the same way with him as they did with you, he should question himself and see this as an opportunity to be inspired by your way of playing.\n\nKids like it when it's fun, and he should relax. If he bothers you when you're all having fun, you were right to ask him to leave. I think your brother might be feeling a little jealous and would like to play with his children, but doesn't necessarily know how to go about it.", "NTA. The kids are having fun and nobody is being harmed. If he doesn't like it, he doesn't have to watch.

Kids don't care!", "INFO: Have you considered getting one of the bins that's just a bunch of random bricks rather than a specific set? That way, the kids can be creative, there aren't directions that your brother will feel have been \"messed up,\" AND you can reuse the same bricks every time the kids visit you. If they're sad/reluctant to destroy their creations, take a photo and start a Lego photo album so you can see how their creativity grows through the years as their brains continue to develop.", "NTA.

Playing doesn't come with a script where everyone plays the same part over and over. That isn't fun. So stop harshing the fun. Go do something else please.

The working rule here is \"don't yuck someone's yum.\" If your brother likes putting sets together per the instructions - that's cool. But if you and the kids enjoy mixing up sets when playing with them - that's your fun, and your brother shouldn't be telling you you are doing it wrong, especially if they are your sets. \n\nAs far as excluding him from the play - people don't want to include someone who is going to tell them that their fun is wrong and is going to control everything.

They have more fun playing with Legos by doing free builds or imaginative play than just following the directions.  I have had people offer to get them Legos for birthdays and I just tell them up front that they need to be ok with the fact we may not build it the way intended. Or we may once and then take it apart. Our friends haven't cared but I know some people think Legos should only be played a certain way which is silly.", "As long as pieces aren\u2019t getting lost, there\u2019s nothing wrong with mixing up some sets. My young cousin likes to mix her Lego sets together sometimes, while other times she wants to build exactly what the instructions say. She was very disappointed when her shopping mall ended up missing some windows and floor tiles because those pieces had been lost during a previous play session. (I *did* help her look for the pieces, and I had found several other missing ones already.)", "NTA, by the way Legos with premade structures and instructions make sense to build some skills, but make me so sad. I grew up in the 90's with random Lego pieces and played building imaginary animals, buildings and structures. I had so much fun. Your approach for sure brings more creativity and a more relaxed approach to the game. Sounds like your brother is very rigid / narrow minded (possibly some OCD?) and a different approach is healthy for the kids.", "I played with Legos as a child in the 60s they were not about building a specific thing.  They were set of bricks to promote creative play.  It make me sad to hear people insisting on \"building it right\"", "NTA.

They need to be given things they are free to mess up, mix up, and personalize.", "Some kids do care. I definitely regretted letting clay colors mix (it wasn\u2019t deliberate, I was trying to copy a sculpture in a picture on the packaging that used multiple colors, and of course they cross contaminated) when I was a child.", "Unfortunately not, it sounds like if he was 12 it would actually help his cause. To clarify, because I am so sick and tired of people using acronyms everywhere on Reddit and just assuming we all know what they mean, OP says his brother is ND. No, his brother isn't North Dakota, he's neuro-divergent. Essentially both OP and his bro have autism to some degree. It sounds like bro doesn't bother getting any sort of help with this, unlike OP", "How am.i punishing the kids?", "Clay is not separable like Lego. One is made of discrete and solid material, the other is just malleable mush.
