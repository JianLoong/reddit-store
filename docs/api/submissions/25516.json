I love her humor, everything. We've been dating since college and are now almost 30. (It hurt to type \"almost 30\" \ud83d\ude2d)\n\nI was invited to a birthday party by some new friends recently and they asked me if my GF was coming. I always talk about her and hype her up so they were all excited to meet her.\n\nThe day of the party comes and she looks amazing! She had some nice jeans on and a cute crop top. I noticed she wasn't wearing any makeup so I asked her if she were going to put some on.\n\nShe took this terribly and made it sound like I was making her out as some sort of trophy wife/gf. Keep in mind I NEVER ask this from her. When we go out on dates, I could care less what she looks like. It's also not like she never wears makeup. Whenever she goes out with the girls, she's all done up.\n\nAt least for me, if I were being introduced to some friends of my GF, I would try to look my absolute best for her. I want to look as good as I can to make her look good as well! We are practically married at this point and I see her as an extension of me and vice-versa.\n\nI also understand I have no say/control in what she wants to do/wear. So I most likely am the asshole for even asking it.

I wouldn't want my partner to look schlubby, or like they don't care, eg wearing old sweats to an outing with my friends. Not because I need people to think my partner is attractive (i.e. show pony) but because I want my partner to make a positive, or at least neutral, impression on people whose opinions I value, I wouldn't want their appearance or behavior to put out the energy that they don't care, they don't want to be there, etc. \n\nBut I also tend to base how I dress for my partner's social events on what they look like, and I model the dress code/expectation for my social events and expect them to kinda match it as well. We consult each other on our outfits when we're getting ready lol.\n\nSo what did you wear that you felt like her \"nice jeans and cute crop top\" were not enough effort in comparison to?   \nOr was it not her clothes that you felt were too low effort, but that her hair had not been attended to enough? Did she not smell clean? These are the things you say that you ensure are attended to when you're going to events with her, which is why I ask.", "Why not?", "Dude. If multiple people are coming to the same wrong conclusion, there's only one commonality and it's your choice of wording.", "What do you do besides put on a nice outfit and comb your hair?", "Yeah so am I. That\u2019s why I said if it works for some then it works for them just my opinion", "you\u2019re either lying to us or yourself. you can\u2019t simultaneously complain that she didn\u2019t put effort or try her best because she didn\u2019t wear makeup and then in the same breath say she doesn\u2019t need makeup/her best isn\u2019t her with makeup on.\n\ndecide what you\u2019re arguing here", "\ud83d\ude05 only sarcastic/hostile to the ones that are being hostile back.\n\nI completely agree with what you said about the show pony thing. It definitely wasn't that. The positive impression on people's opinions I value is true.\n\nIt was a house party so it's not like I wore a tux but I definitely spent time to get ready. I know people think guys put on a tshirt and shorts and is good to go but that's definitely not me.\n\nShe put on a shirt and pants and said she was ready. I live with her, I saw this happen.", "If that's how u live your life, so be it.", "Yep I've realized I'm shit at analogies and comparisons heh.", "But I mean... You say she looked good. What did you wear? How long did you feel like she should have taken to get ready to go to a stranger's house party? Was her hair already looking fine, her teeth already brushed, deodorant already applied... So all she needed to get ready was just clothes?\n\nDo you think that by looking at you, people could estimate that you'd put meaningful effort into looking that way? I wear makeup regularly for work, friend outings, etc but not every single day. But tbh, makeup is not \"effortful\" for me at all and is faster than most of my other self care routines such as oral hygiene, hair, or skincare routine. If I put on jeans, a tank top, sunscreen blush concealer mascara brow gel and lip balm, and brushed my hair ... I'm still out the door in about 7-10 minutes. I will have put in exactly the amount of effort I do to go into the office in the morning as I would for the party. So I guess I'm just confused where you see her not putting in enough effort when you say she looked \"amazing\" and was wearing \"nice\" jeans and a \"cute\" top. These all sound like just the right amount of effort for a casual party to me. I'm sure she evaluated herself in the mirror and saw she looked amazing and felt ready to go, despite needing only to change her clothes to achieve it. \n\nWould you have felt like she still didn't put enough effort/time into it if she applied lipstick in the car or right before walking in?", "Well, do you go to events without makeup on? It seems your girlfriend is OK with doing so but your comment above indicates you\u2019re not OK with her doing so.

The amount of time spent wasn't the issue.\n\nI put in a lot of effort/care into how I look and how people perceive me which probably is BAD.\n\nWhen I say she looked amazing, it's true. She's always beautiful to me. I don't know where I'm going with this. I know I'm wrong and have already made up since this was a couple months ago. I appreciate your thoughtful responses.", "If my girlfriend thought I was a bit underdressed, I would change.\n\nIf my girlfriend thought the clothes I picked out wasn't good, I'd change.\n\nIf my girlfriend thought I smelled weird, I'd shower.\n\nI do things for her if she asked. I do things for her without her asking.", "depends \n\nsometimes my gf helps me put on whatever makeup she has on special occasions.\n\nand generally i use some sunscreen that has a whitening effect? whatever thats called. \n\nno i dont think my natural look is good enough all the time, so sometimes i get my hair done professionally etc. \n\nlol i dont really care what my gf dresses up. she rarely ever uses makeup. i dont like girls with lots of makeup. and we fit each other quite welll that i dress like a bum usually and so does she. lols\n\nbut yeah, when i go pick her up when she with her friends. i try and make sure im looking better than i usually am. because lol. i want her to feel even more proud of me. same when she comes pick me up at work. i ask her to dress better if possible. but stll its ok if she wants to dress like a bum, but generally she also wants to mark her territory but showcasing how pretty she is. so yeah usually we think similarly.", "I don't get why some people are stuck on this. My bad for saying we're practically married???", "Hard disagree. If you've been in a domestic relationship with someone for a decade, you are practically married. Literally the only difference is that you haven't paid the government $100 for a piece of paper.", "I do see the edit, but let me just say, I usually wear makeup, to work, to go shopping, daily activities. When we do go out with my bf I wear makeup that suits the event, a party, just a drink/coffee. But also when I go out with my friends, I tend to stress more abt makeup and put on so much more, because women are judgemental. Not exactly my friends, I do trust them, but other women at the place. It might not be the case for your gf, but going out without my SO, putting on more makeup makes me feel better idk how to explain it? Definitely not putting it on for any of the guys, they can\u2019t even tell if someone wears makeup most of the time lol.

Sad that you even have to ask.", "Yup YTA and based off your comments you absolutely suck in general", "Dude, don\u2019t let yourself get conditioned by insecure women in this thread. They (and, sadly, your GF) will \u201cread between the lines\u201d and go out of their way to get insulted by something you neither said nor meant. It\u2019s a them problem, not a you problem. You have to stop that shit in its tracks or you\u2019ll be walking blind on a minefield for the rest of your life.\n\nIt was a perfectly legitimate question (not even a request!), especially given that she puts on makeup every time for her friends and it\u2019s the only first time she will meet yours. NTA.", "NTA these comments are crazy. If you were going to meet her parents and you were wearing a tee-shirt, she would totally be in her rights to ask you to put on a button down. Or to shower and do your hair/shave your stubble. \n\nYou can want your partner to look nice for events that are important to you. You and your partner present as a package deal out in the world.", "Ah the ol\u2019 boyfriend asking his gf to wear makeup thing. A tale as old as time.", "NTA. When I go to a social outing I don\u2019t show up in a kfc t-shirt, shorts and flip flops. \n\nIt normal to dress to match the occasion. You were right to ask.", "Absolutely ya if my bf said that he would no longer have a gf.", "YTA, apologize and hope she accepts.", "INFO \n\nWhat kind of make-up were you wearing for the party?", "Gross, YTA.", "Yta", "YTA. \n\nI\u2019m in my mid-40\u2019s and almost never put makeup on, I don\u2019t need it.

I know you did'nt, but that is what she heard.\n\nApologise to her", "Not gonna give a judgment because everyone else has said it all quite thoroughly, and I do believe you have started to understand where you went wrong and want to learn. And good on you for that. (Though I must say, I was getting teary-eyed reading some of these comments, thinking of how awful it must have felt for her to have societal bullshit reinforced by her loving partner, whether intended or not.)\n\nI just wanted to say that it's not fair of you to hold her to the same standard that you hold yourself to. People have different priorities. It seems like you get great satisfaction out of putting tons of effort into your appearance, which is totally fine. For you. Some folks, like me, and maybe your girlfriend, don't derive as much satisfaction from that. We put in enough effort to feel good about *ourselves* and, if it's not like a job interview or a formal event, then if my level of effort isn't satisfactory to the people I'm with, then they're simply not people I want to be around.\n\nBest of luck to you, my guy. As someone who is actually 30, I can say there's still much to learn until then and it's good that you're open to it.", "Yes", "NTA IMO", "YTA, but more importantly, I hope you truly take a DEEP look at your motivation for asking her to wear makeup. At best, you wanted to show her off like an object and at worst, you don't think she is presentable without it. \n\nBoth make you the asshole.\n\nYou need more than an apology here, OP. You need a grand gesture. Time to make amends.", "YTA You should have just let her go out with her final look without wanting to enquire about dolling herself up.\n\nAlso you said you \"could care less\" about what she looks like which and either YTA for caring which you do or YTA for using that incorrect phrase that means exactly the opposite of what it says. It's like calling fire cold or an ice age boiling.", "So you know for the future, it's \"I *couldn't care less\"", "\u201ctHis WaS fUn\u201d yah ok buddy fuck off", "You say you met at \u201c collage \u201c and yet you wrote \u201c I could care less\u201d? Wow", "Hey man, I'm not going to comment on this particular situation because it seems pretty well covered but overall, it's great that you are  taking accountability for this. We all say and do things sometimes that we don't intend to be hurtful but are. It's how we respond to learning that we messed up that makes the difference. Taking accountability, owning our mistakes, learning from them, and then implementing a change to our behavior. That's the indicator of a good person. That's what's going to make your relationship last too.\n\n And you are young, sorry people are pushing the marriage thing, WTF- good for you for going at your own pace. Get married when you are ready, not before.", "Came here looking for this comment - thank you!", "I thought guys preferred girls au natural\u00e9, I know me and my mates do, this really fucking jarred me.", "Lol.

I hope for your sake you didn\u2019t use this rationale to justify yourself to your girlfriend.\n\nMaybe she was feeling extra hot and confident and wanted to go all natural that night.

Makeup is a good tool for some (man or woman) to enhance a feature(s) Some women like to do it, some dont wanna do it at all and some like it right in the middle. The problem however, is once that makeup is on it hides imperfections. This has set the shitty precedent that \u201cwomen are supposed to wear makeup\u201d. A good way to look at it is like a car, no one is gonna buy a car thats just raw metal\u2026 paint it up. Thats how society treats it for women and its fucked. \n\nIf you already think your GF is beautiful than think of makeup as a treat. Every once and awhile you see that same beauty but amped up. I personally prefer the natural look but Im no fool, makeup when done right is \ud83e\udd0c. Even a little can change the way you see something. Don\u2019t expect it to be the standard, just enjoy it when it happens. Hope this helps, it just sounds like you misunderstood makeup. I hope you\u2019ve learned something.", "Ha. No you won\u2019t. You are much too vain for that.", "Nah man. I mean, we\u2019re both prolly gonna get downvoted but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re sexist. You just sound like a dope, no offense. I mean, admittedly I learned not to make that mistake at 17 but we also all have different experience levels. I also think it\u2019s unfair for everyone to get as mad at you as they are. There\u2019s just a blatant disconnect between men and women when it comes to makeup. To a guy, asking a women to wear some makeup is like them asking us to dress up in a nicer shirt and tie. Obviously, women in general don\u2019t see that as equal level, which considering makeup takes a lot more time and changes your physical appearance I get, but most guys just don\u2019t know that. In regard to the extension of you thing, ya that wasn\u2019t great. We say that kind of thing to our kids and schoolchildren. So you kind of infantilized her and made her less of an equal so you should probably cut that out if you want to get married. Beyond that though, it\u2019s life \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f if everyone got as up in arms in real life as they do on Reddit relationships would never last.
