I love her humor, everything. We've been dating since college and are now almost 30. (It hurt to type \"almost 30\" \ud83d\ude2d)\n\nI was invited to a birthday party by some new friends recently and they asked me if my GF was coming. I always talk about her and hype her up so they were all excited to meet her.\n\nThe day of the party comes and she looks amazing! She had some nice jeans on and a cute crop top. I noticed she wasn't wearing any makeup so I asked her if she were going to put some on.\n\nShe took this terribly and made it sound like I was making her out as some sort of trophy wife/gf. Keep in mind I NEVER ask this from her. When we go out on dates, I could care less what she looks like. It's also not like she never wears makeup. Whenever she goes out with the girls, she's all done up.\n\nAt least for me, if I were being introduced to some friends of my GF, I would try to look my absolute best for her. I want to look as good as I can to make her look good as well! We are practically married at this point and I see her as an extension of me and vice-versa.\n\nI also understand I have no say/control in what she wants to do/wear. So I most likely am the asshole for even asking it.

Not because I need people to think my partner is attractive (i.e. show pony) but because I want my partner to make a positive, or at least neutral, impression on people whose opinions I value, I wouldn't want their appearance or behavior to put out the energy that they don't care, they don't want to be there, etc. \n\nBut I also tend to base how I dress for my partner's social events on what they look like, and I model the dress code/expectation for my social events and expect them to kinda match it as well. We consult each other on our outfits when we're getting ready lol.\n\nSo what did you wear that you felt like her \"nice jeans and cute crop top\" were not enough effort in comparison to?   \nOr was it not her clothes that you felt were too low effort, but that her hair had not been attended to enough?

It definitely wasn't that. The positive impression on people's opinions I value is true.\n\nIt was a house party so it's not like I wore a tux but I definitely spent time to get ready.

What did you wear? How long did you feel like she should have taken to get ready to go to a stranger's house party? Was her hair already looking fine, her teeth already brushed, deodorant already applied... So all she needed to get ready was just clothes?\n\nDo you think that by looking at you, people could estimate that you'd put meaningful effort into looking that way? I wear makeup regularly for work, friend outings, etc but not every single day. But tbh, makeup is not \"effortful\" for me at all and is faster than most of my other self care routines such as oral hygiene, hair, or skincare routine. If I put on jeans, a tank top, sunscreen blush concealer mascara brow gel and lip balm, and brushed my hair ... I'm still out the door in about 7-10 minutes. I will have put in exactly the amount of effort I do to go into the office in the morning as I would for the party. So I guess I'm just confused where you see her not putting in enough effort when you say she looked \"amazing\" and was wearing \"nice\" jeans and a \"cute\" top. These all sound like just the right amount of effort for a casual party to me. I'm sure she evaluated herself in the mirror and saw she looked amazing and felt ready to go, despite needing only to change her clothes to achieve it. \n\nWould you have felt like she still didn't put enough effort/time into it if she applied lipstick in the car or right before walking in?", "Well, do you go to events without makeup on?

People have different priorities. It seems like you get great satisfaction out of putting tons of effort into your appearance, which is totally fine. For you.

We put in enough effort to feel good about *ourselves* and, if it's not like a job interview or a formal event, then if my level of effort isn't satisfactory to the people I'm with, then they're simply not people I want to be around.\n\nBest of luck to you, my guy.

There\u2019s just a blatant disconnect between men and women when it comes to makeup. To a guy, asking a women to wear some makeup is like them asking us to dress up in a nicer shirt and tie. Obviously, women in general don\u2019t see that as equal level, which considering makeup takes a lot more time and changes your physical appearance I get, but most guys just don\u2019t know that. In regard to the extension of you thing, ya that wasn\u2019t great. We say that kind of thing to our kids and schoolchildren.

So gross.", "Does she like your expensive watches and cologne or are they for you and your friends?", "I\u2019m a professional make up artist and you are a galloping YTA.\n\nI worked make up retail alongside freelance jobs and I drove my boss mad by telling women if they didn\u2019t want to wear make up they didn\u2019t have to. But I told men they could if they wanted. Often people just wanted to look groomed: advice on tidying eye brows, covering a blemish, shaving tips, hiding sweat or getting flushed from alcohol. They wanted to look and feel good but not commit to the equivalent of cultivating a palm house when they just had a small lawn and liked it to look welcoming and useable.\n\nI would show them those things, sell them products or tools to achieve it, sort skincare if asked and I didn\u2019t push make up. I used to get a lot of customers ask this all while telling me I wore too much make up and would hate to look like me and how shallow it was. I would just at some point mention I couldn\u2019t be that dumb if they had to ask my help\u2026\n\nAnd my sales figures were through the roof. My boss had to eat their words. I had women buying no make up but skincare and men walking out to rival glam era Bowie. I worked on commission who it actually kind of mattered to me. But by being honest and open, I gained so many sales where people bought themselves fancy bath stuff instead of make up, recommended like minded friends to come to me, did their Christmas shopping at my retailer.\n\nI wore a full face of make up every single day. I started at 15. I\u2019m 45. I still wear a lot of make up because I love it. I love applying it. I love the skill, creativity and colour. I hate doing my hair so I have shaved my head since I was 18. The idea of having to style my hair as a woman leaves me bored, cold and stressed out. I realise this is how many women feel about make up.\n\nIf your partner is hygienic then it\u2019s a you issue if you feel they should do full hair or make up to impress others. The whole point of natural is to be \u2018maybe she\u2019s born with it, maybe it\u2019s Maybelline.\u2019 The phrase is \u2018I want to look like me but better.\u2019 You don\u2019t notice because it\u2019s seamless. Did you notice the difference glaringly when she covered a blemish, tweaked your hair and showed you how to work a shirt or did you notice the steps she took you didn\u2019t know?\n\nAnd did you pay for the products she used on you? Are you paying for her products? For me, it costs more to have a skin care regime that gives me the effect of glowy skincare than my Armani foundation and a brush. I bought the bottle in 2019, I apply lightly and in a targeted fashion. My partner of 7 years who is also a woman had no idea I wore foundation. Thought I went \u2018bare faced\u2019 except for the fairly noticeable smoky eye, liquid liner etc. Didn\u2019t know there is foundation, concealer, bronzer, blush and that I still take way less time to get ready that her.\n\nI have no fucking idea what 97 stages her waist length hair takes. Seems like a full time job. Looks gorgeous. She is gorgeous. I have no idea because she likes the feeling I just see that all as magic and her as magic. She likes to watch me build my face because she finds the skill fascinating. \n\nShe\u2019s not asking me to switch toothpaste because I love mine but it\u2019s a running joke in our social circle it smells like Tiger Balm, looks like your grandad would have used it in the war and most people don\u2019t like it. She knows I have one filling aged 45 and doesn\u2019t check if I brushed my teeth properly because she trusts me to be able to conduct *self care* without being checked like a school pupil. My dentist had advice. I took it.\n\nMake up is not essential, it should be a choice and not your face, not your business if it\u2019s a choice.

I was married for 11 years (now divorced), been with current partner for 6 years and living together for 4, so I think I have a good perspective on the difference between being married and \"practically married.\" \n\nFor me the differences have been: \n\n\\-Financial. When I was married, we did not merge all our accounts, but we had \"his, hers and ours\" accounts, shared our most frequently used credit card, and owned a home together. We decided on large purchases together. This ties you to someone, for better or worse, in a way my current partner and I are not. \n\n\\-Familial. Being married allowed me a different relationship with my ex-husband's family and a different level of acceptance by them than I have with my current partner. Once we got married, they saw our relationship as permanent (although it turned out not to be) and definitely treated me differently. My current partner and his family would tell you I'm a member of their family now, but I've been married before, and I can feel the difference.\n\n\\-Social. People saw my husband and me differently than they see my partner and me. Again, this is one of those intangibles and it may or may not matter to you, but being married changes how your relationship is perceived by the world.\n\n\\-Emotional. Being married changed our relationship. I think in a good relationship, the change is probably for the better. In ours, unfortunately the sense that we were now legally bound together \"forever\" led to a lot of power struggles and fights, particularly early on. \n\nI go back and forth with whether or not I'd want to be married again. Part of me would like to, but I also see the disadvantages. It is definitely another level of commitment and for me, I've found that not being married allows me to maintain a certain level of financial and emotional autonomy that I didn't have when I was married, even though I live with my partner and we spend every day together.", "I\u2019ll give one long-winded example, although I could give several. I made a ton of financial and career sacrifices throughout our dating/engaged life (we were engaged much longer than planned because of COVID). I initially took a huge pay cut to move to the city he lived in, then I went back to grad school to somewhat reinvent my career in a way that it made sense for me to live in that city long-term, so I could support him in pursuing his career. Basically I made decisions that made sense for us long-term as a couple, as opposed to what made most sense for me as an individual.  At one point not long before we got married I did the math and I had lost somewhere between $300,000 and $400,000 in earning potential throughout our relationship.  Before we were married, I would have gotten none of that back if we broke up and I had a lot of anxiety about the decisions I made, and a certain level of resentment that he was succeeding professionally at the expense of my career. Now that we\u2019re married, I have a true stake in everything he\u2019s accomplished due to my sacrifices, and I feel a lot more secure in life.  We can support each other a lot better because we are truly partners in every sense of the word.  There\u2019s no resentment because everything we do, we do with each other and for each other.  There\u2019s no more agonizing over decisions trying to weigh what\u2019s best for ME vs. what\u2019s best for US, because what\u2019s best for US is what\u2019s best for ME.
