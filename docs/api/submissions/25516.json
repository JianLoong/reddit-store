Won't make that mistake again\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\n---------\n\nSo just typing out that title, it sounds terrible. I love my GF. I love the way she looks. I love her humor, everything. We've been dating since college and are now almost 30. (It hurt to type \"almost 30\" \ud83d\ude2d)\n\nI was invited to a birthday party by some new friends recently and they asked me if my GF was coming. I always talk about her and hype her up so they were all excited to meet her.\n\nThe day of the party comes and she looks amazing! She had some nice jeans on and a cute crop top. I noticed she wasn't wearing any makeup so I asked her if she were going to put some on.\n\nShe took this terribly and made it sound like I was making her out as some sort of trophy wife/gf. Keep in mind I NEVER ask this from her. When we go out on dates, I could care less what she looks like. It's also not like she never wears makeup. Whenever she goes out with the girls, she's all done up.\n\nAt least for me, if I were being introduced to some friends of my GF, I would try to look my absolute best for her. I want to look as good as I can to make her look good as well! We are practically married at this point and I see her as an extension of me and vice-versa.\n\nI also understand I have no say/control in what she wants to do/wear. So I most likely am the asshole for even asking it.
