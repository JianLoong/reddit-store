My husband and I have both tried talking to her at first and she said she didn\u2019t know she wasn\u2019t supposed to eat it so we started putting do not eat on it and nothing changed.

Last Saturday morning she woke us up angrily and yelled at us saying we could\u2019ve just woken up before her to make sure she didn\u2019t do it. She hasn\u2019t talked to us much since.

You don\u2019t want your baked goods eaten, you\u2019ve told her many times, and you\u2019ve left notes for her, so she shouldn\u2019t be trying to eat them.

That kind of person, even if they\u2019re family, is absolutely draining to have in your home. \n\nIf she isn\u2019t usually like this, and is generally kind, but has recently started behaving this way around food, it could be a reaction to grief.

While it is understandable that you and your husband are frustrated with her eating all the food you make, there are better ways to handle the situation than deception. You could try having a frank conversation with her about how much time and effort you put into baking and how it makes you feel when she eats it all. Perhaps you could also compromise and set aside a specific amount of baked goods for her to enjoy without eating everything.

I feel so strange seeing you in this position with your mother who is nearly 6 years younger than me, when I have been dealing with a mother who was also widowed last year.  My mom is in assisted living and she's 86.  We moved my mom to assisted living a few weeks after my dad died because I couldn't mentally or physically deal with the demands of her care in my home.\n\nFirst I saw your comment that you would talk to your husband about dedicating all of Sunday to her. This was in response to people saying this behavior was a bid for attention.\n\nMy advice is that you don't reward bad behavior, whether it's a toddler doing it or your mother-in-law doing it.  Make her use her words.  If she's lonely and wants more attention, tell her that she needs to SAY so.  And you will have a discussion about how to address that in a way that doesn't take away from the life you're building with your husband. Perhaps once or twice a month you all could take little day trips around to see flea markets or do local sight seeing.  \n\nLong term, the goal should be to return her to living  independently.  Unless you and your husband genuinely enjoy having her live with you.  I genuinely enjoyed long vacations with my mother-in-law, so no judgement there. Mulit generation family living arrangements don't need to be dismissed out of hand. \n\nBut the starting point as everyone else has discussed is getting your mother-in-law to the doctor for a complete evaluation. And she should receive some sort of grief support moderated by a mental health professional. I wish I could do the latter for my mother but she has actual early stage dementia and other issues that make that impossible. \n\nI'm very sorry for your family's loss.
