We love to bake different dishes and bring them to the club meetings. We bake cakes, cupcakes, cookies, and sometimes try different things. It\u2019s our little bonding after working all week. We bake every Thursday/Friday night and the meetings are Saturday afternoon.\n\nBack to the post though, the problem now is his mother (51f) has been living with us since his dad passed a year ago and recently the past couple weeks she\u2019s been eating ALL of the food we bake before we wake up. It would be one thing if she ate one cupcake but we could make 24 and wake up to it all gone. My husband and I have both tried talking to her at first and she said she didn\u2019t know she wasn\u2019t supposed to eat it so we started putting do not eat on it and nothing changed. It has made us have to not go or show up empty handed.\n\nI consulted with my husband first since it\u2019s his mother but I bought two circle styrofoams and decorated them with frosting and fruit I put up my usual note of DO NOT EAT! and then I set it out. Last Saturday morning she woke us up angrily and yelled at us saying we could\u2019ve just woken up before her to make sure she didn\u2019t do it. She hasn\u2019t talked to us much since. My husband says she\u2019ll get over herself but his siblings started texting us calling us names.

Your hubby can tell his \u201csiblings\u201d that they can take her if they are so concerned. NTA", "NTA but I seriously think you guys should consider getting her into counseling or joining a local grief over loss group.

She\u2019s living with you, and it\u2019s very kind of you to have opened your home and supported her while she\u2019s going through the grief of losing her husband. She does not have the right to take your specially baked food for club meetings and it\u2019s extremely inappropriate that she\u2019s continuing to do so after being repeatedly told not to by you and your husband. You don\u2019t want your baked goods eaten, you\u2019ve told her many times, and you\u2019ve left notes for her, so she shouldn\u2019t be trying to eat them. It\u2019s entitled to be angry about finding a fake cake when you know you shouldn\u2019t be poking around the real cake!! She\u2019s also TA for being so rude about it and texting you after the fact and calling you names! You\u2019re not in the wrong for this. \n\nDoes she usually behave this way? Is she generally entitled and demanding and unreasonable about things? If so, it may be best if she looks into a living situation that is separate from yours. That kind of person, even if they\u2019re family, is absolutely draining to have in your home. \n\nIf she isn\u2019t usually like this, and is generally kind, but has recently started behaving this way around food, it could be a reaction to grief. Therapy might be helpful in that case. But, it\u2019s still up to you and your husband if this living situation can continue, and she needs to respect your boundaries in your home.\n\nBest of luck! I hope no more if your delicious baked goods are eaten, except by the people who they\u2019re baked for!", "NTA\n\nYou tried diplomacy, she rejected your requests and continues to disrespect you.

Because these are not normal eating habits.  If she's putting away two dozen cupcakes at a sitting twice a week, something has got to be going on.  Does this happen with other foods?

I think it\u2019s hilarious. \n\nI do have to wonder about the two dozen cupcakes though. Is she \u201call there\u201d cognitively? My great aunt has dementia/Alzheimer\u2019s and one of the first signs was that she wouldn\u2019t realize how much she\u2019d eaten until she was so full that she was sick.

Your MIL sounds like an entitled nightmare. \n\nI have to know\u2026she finished off the styrofoam cupcakes too though, right?", "NTA if you\u2019ve already talked to her about it and have made it clear that you didn\u2019t want it touched then she\u2019s clearly disrespecting you. I mean I love the food deception thing, shouldn\u2019t be touching your stuff lol. She\u2019s a grown woman who knows what she can and can\u2019t do, so for her to tell you to wake up before her to stop her is just absurd. Make extra for her or something if you\u2019re looking for a solution, label it with MIL name so she can have some", "NTA\u2026did she really eat 24 cupcakes and then claim she didn\u2019t know she wasn\u2019t supposed to consume all of them?  Mind blowing that she can\u2019t comprehend how selfish and entitled this behavior is.  \n\nYou\u2019ve left notes saying do not eat and she still doesn\u2019t comply.

It happened to a friend of mine\u2019s mom after her husband died. So she needs to see probably a primary and have some blood work done and testing. Then talk to psychologist or psychiatrist.", "Info:\n\nIs there a away of involving his mother in these outings for the time being? I think it is impossible for her to eat 20 cupcakes in one sitting.. It's more likely she destroys them somehow so that you won't leave her alone on a Saturday. Yeah, not the right thing to do, but makes me feel kinda sad for her.", "How old is she. Reduced impulse control could be a sign of dementia", "That was kind of petty.\n\nAnd I love it.", "NTA. This is strange behavior. Does she have other abnormal eating habits or is it just about baked goods? It sounds like she has a potential eating disorder such as Binge Eating Disorder. I don't know how she can possibly eat 24 cupcakes back to back. It's not fair for you that she essentially ruins your hardwork that you also spent money on. It's not fair that you can't engage in a very important hobby to you in your own home", "NTA, she is young is there a reason why she left her home to live with you guys? I mean my mom is 56 and she has 2 preteens at home and my mil is 64 and she is a yoga teacher that likes to travel around the world , some of my friends parents are vp\u2019s of transnational companies at 60 something and very active. so at 51 unless she has some sort of health issues I don\u2019t see why she needs to be mooching from her kids.", "\"AITA for making fake food\"\n\n\"she\u2019s been eating ALL of the food we bake before we wake up.\"\n\nLOL!\n\nYTA\n\nTruthfully, I approve of the sentiment. But after a few moments of thought I think what you did was very dangerous and I approve quite a bit more of your in-laws' rage against you. I do not consider tricking someone to bite into something inorganic that can easily fall apart like styrofoam to be a harmless prank. You created a choking and possibly inhalation hazard. I consider it a reckless disregard for others' well-being, to the point that it's a little sick.", ">we could make 24 [cupcakes] and wake up to it all gone.\n\nYTA. If you're not exaggerating, then you and your husband should be concerned about her mental health, not her diet. Pranking her with fake food isn't so funny when her issue is depression, dementia, or an eating disorder.", "YTA for making fake food to deceive your mother-in-law. While it is understandable that you and your husband are frustrated with her eating all the food you make, there are better ways to handle the situation than deception. You could try having a frank conversation with her about how much time and effort you put into baking and how it makes you feel when she eats it all. Perhaps you could also compromise and set aside a specific amount of baked goods for her to enjoy without eating everything. Resorting to deception is not a mature or effective way to handle the situation and it has only caused more conflict in your family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

TWENTY FOUR CUPCAKES?!?!?! ....HOW IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE?!\n\nYeah, there's something much deeper going on here. You need to get her to a therapist and she's going to need a good psychiatrist as well. This is absolutely not just binge eating caused by grief. If anything, grief just triggered something that had yet to become a serious health concern.\n\nAlso, reach out to the siblings if you're worried about that. I have a strong feeling she's telling them a very exaggerated/entirely dishonest version of events. Probably something along the lines of \"they made cupcakes and won't let me have any!\"", "That is also a them problem, not a you problem. They should be texting her about being respectful if she wants to stay under your roof.\n\nIs she really binge eating that much food? Or is she just getting rid of it because she wants you to stay home on a Saturday evening? Both are wrong, but the former is more concerning from a mental health standpoint. Is it possible she\u2019s bulimic?", "It could also be a sign of dementia.  She really needs to be evaluated.", "I believe even if it's labelled, there is a legal precedent set that if you tampered with the food *knowing* someone would eat it, it is still illegal.", "Actually, it could be.  Early onset dementia can effect people in their early 40's.  She needs to be evaluated."]}
