I\u2019ve settled for trying to keep my room as neat as possible over the next week or so and also ask my brother for permission.

Sorry but this doesn't sound like abuse like you're Harry Potter living under the stairs. I bet your mom is (rightly) worried that if you move into his room, you'll just accumulate more stuff and it'll end up being the same thing but with more stuff. Why not get rid of your old stuff? Can you ask your mom to help you figure out a way to get more organized in your current room?", "NAH\n\nYou are completely justified in wanting more space, and your mom and brother are justified in the sentiment of wanting to hold the space for him as he transitions out. The move itself may happen in days, but the heart side of it may take longer.\n\nHave you talked to your brother about how he feels about it? If he's agreeable with it, then maybe you could get him to suggest it to your mom and set up your current room as his own room.\n\nHe may not be ok with it, or she might still be against it. End of the day, it's her house. That doesn't mean you can't still find some solutions. You say you have a lot of stuff being stored in your room - see if you can get that stuff to be stored in his room in a corner or something, and come up with a proposal design of how you want to keep your room (and how it would be tidier) if you could clear out some of the stuff you don't use anymore.", "YWNBTA but I just read the edit and if your mom is actually the one who wants to keep your old toys for \"memories\" sake and you have no use for them at all, shouldn't she be the one to store them?\nYou said your room is turning into a storage unit and your mother is hounding you about being messy, so you should bring this up in the future because you deserve to have a space that's yours and not the prep kitchen for your mother's future nostalgia.\nWait a while until the room situation has resolved itself and then try to bring it up when both of you have time and patience for it. And be as polite as possible because this is probably dear to her heart. Just say something like \"Hey, I was sorting through my things and I found these. I don't need them anymore but I wanted to ask if you would like to keep some of them as memorabilia because I know that they are important to you. If you want to keep them, could we please store them in the attic/basement/not my room, so I can try and be more organised? If not, I was thinking about donating them out giving them away to *insert younger family member or family friend*, so another child can enjoy them and they don't go to waste.\"", "YWNBTA your brother has his own place. Holding out a space you could use for yourself and that has no other real purpose but to let guests sleep (because that is what your brother is now when he comes over) is cruel.

Why should the youngest stay in a smaller room forever..?", "NTA\n\nTalk to your brother but organize yourself too.   If you tend to be messy, a bigger room just means a bigger mess.  \n\nBut maybe you can set up a craft area in a corner of his his room just to start the transition so they both get used to the idea.", "YWNBTA for moving into a free room that better suits your current wants and needs. \n\nYour brother has literally left the building.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That your sense is that she wants to hold onto them which is fine but that you don't have the storage space.\n\nGetting rid of/donating things is always hard but always amazing how much space you have when you are done. I did that with my clothing about 2 weeks ago- went thru my entire wardrobe. Ended up getting rid of about 50% of it. I still have plenty of clothing but now I can actually see what I own.", "This is actually a really good way to put it on her to help you out. I didn't even think to ask: is she the one who wants to keep your old stuff? If so, tell her that she needs to find a spot for it, perhaps even your brother's room!"]}
