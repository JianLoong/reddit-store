It sounds like everyone was trying to do the right thing and no one was being an asshole. You were honest about why you cook the food that you do, and your mom likely felt hurt because it reminded her of her shortcomings in teaching you. Your dad was right to suggest that you apologize to keep the peace, but it doesn't sound like you were wrong for speaking the truth.", "NTA\n\nMy mother, even though is a great mom, could not for the love of God wait for me to do things. She would always get angry at how slowly I moved. And even though she did taught me how to cook, I still couldn't do it. I had to learn myself at 22.

No ifs, buts, whens or how. You, as the student, do not reciprocate that type of treatment inflicted upon you years ago with kindness, and / or with an apology after telling them the truth.

She chose to parent you through verbal/emotional abuse when it came to teachable moments. She is upset because she is now reaping what she sowed (so to speak). I'm glad you were able to grow up and met individuals who were kind and patient and nurturing. You don't owe your mom custom-cooked meals to her liking. She has a broken arm, but her other arm works fine and she can use her one arm and toss a frozen meal in the microwave. Her husband can also make her meals ahead of time and she can reheat them as needed when he is at work. Your parents aren't helpless and they obviously feel entitled to your assistance. I would remind them that there are alternatives they can be doing if the generous help you are providing is not to their standard. Also, remind your dad that the truth hurts, so if your mother's feelings are hurt, perhaps she should do some self reflection.

But isn\u2019t it true you are sorry it hurt her feelings? But she\u2019s mom and you love her so are there to help? Mom stay out of the kitchen when you cook. A compromise sounds reasonable on both sides. Instant mashed potatoes if you don\u2019t want to make the real deal. Gravy mixes. Bake maybe pieces of chicken. Set a timer and not slave over a stove. Baked potatoes. Crockpot recipes online. Toss all in and slow cook and go about your business. And still make Japanese food but not all the time for them. Sorry she was so critical as you were growing up. Her admitting it. Maybe that is a good thing. Adding that for many years I cooked and had my husband walk food over to his mom\u2019s.

You just talked about your fianc\u00e9 helping you", "NTA - had the same problems with my mom (cooking) AND my dad (working stuff like car maintenance, how to repair sth, ...). Today my mom is totally fine with me cooking. I learnt anything by myself through reading, videos and try'n'error. We often talk about this issue and she still is heartbroken that she reacted that way earlier. I guess your mom is too, but can't apologize or admit her mistakes. Maybe she feels bad but can't tell you. The other possibility would be she is TA because she did it on purpose and is now insulted when you talk about it.", "NTA. I am most comfortable making Mexican food because I grew up around it so I get it. I do branch out and make other stuff, but Mexican is where it's at.", "NTA, truth hurts because it is the truth. It is compounded by the fact she HAS to rely on you for cooking and everytime she eats she will remember how badly she treated you to the point of having to learn elsewhere. This is something she needs to work through, not you. You have said your peace.", "You do not owe someone comfort and reassurance when they feel remorse for having mistreated you. Especially not your parent who is now experiencing a fraction of the mental distress she deliberately inflicted on you as a child. \n\nHonestly, if she\u2019s smart enough to see it, this is her chance to begin to repair the harm she caused you and your relationship. And the only way that can happen is if she doesn\u2019t back away from the reality of what she did to you. You can\u2019t (and shouldn\u2019t) force her to do that, but by no means do you need to give her permission to pull back from the early stages of that awareness.\n\nNTA", "I'm gonna go with NAH. Just because something needs to bebsaid it doesn't mean it needs to be heard. She sounds like she was trying to make amends and you should talk to her", "NTA, but blaming your mom forever isn\u2019t useful. I\u2019m a pretty good cook, but it\u2019s not because I learned from my mom. She\u2019s not a very good cook and we ate out a lot growing up. I left home without a lot of necessary adult skills, well beyond cooking. I learned from the internet. I found step by step instructions, videos, whatever. You can, too. \n\nYes, you can go through life holding on to the shit from childhood and using that as an excuse forever, or don\u2019t and find ways to figure out what you need to know. All of the information is out there.", "I think it's a bit weird that OP seems to be so focused on having someone teach her how to cook. Mum only showed her some basics so she had to have a boyfriend teach her how to cook. At some point you can just teach yourself to cook. Most meals I cook I learnt to cook myself. I think it's time to stop blaming mum for her only being able to cook Japanese food. \n\nThat said NTA, OP cooks and mum should be happy with what is served.", "Depends on the age as well.  My mom moved in with us when she broke her arm.  She could not do her hair, pull up her pants, hook her bra, much less housework.

Items causes her issues as well.", "Yeah, when I was 11, I broke one leg and sprained my other ankle at the same time (an incident with a sled and some stairs), a week before my sister's birthday. I basically had to use a wheelchair, and we had a very inaccessible house. It was one of those townhomes where everything is so narrow. \n\nPoint being, I was an aspiring baker, and had promised my sister I would make cupcakes for her birthday. My mom tried to convince me that she would do it instead, but I insisted because my little sister had been having a hard time since my accident (she felt like the incident that caused it was somewhat her fault, because it was her idea to ride the sled down the stairs. I don't blame her, though, she'd done it first and was fine, she didn't know), and I wanted to show her there was no bad blood, so I insisted on making the cupcakes.\n\nI did need a tiny bit of help because our kitchen was too narrow for a wheelchair (to give you an idea, we couldn't have the dishwasher and oven open at the same time, because they were kinda across from each other, and just one being open took up most of the space between counters), and it was hard to carry batter and wheel myself, but I did as much of it on my own as I could. \n\nAnd OP's mom is a grown woman and can't figure out something?", "A Person living alone, or two people with one broken arm each, can eat cereal and ready-made-microwaveable-stuff, and then get either a family member or a paid cleaner to come over every three days to do the dishes and vaccuum.", "This is what I was thinking. Why can't Dad cook? Or maybe Mom traumatized him too in the kitchen. \n\nNTA for OP\n\nNow that she is more confident in the kitchen, if she was to branch out and try to make other stuff she is probably more willing to try. But given the past with her mother, I understand why she wouldn't want to try it at \"home\" with Mom there. \n\nNot defending Mom, but Mom probably doesn't truly realize the damage she caused and now hearing the truth is not pleasant. But as always if you don't want the real answer, don't ask the question.", "Maybe his wife was the only one who tried to teach him...they cant have grilled cheese sandwiches every night", "Something something two broken arms.", "How do dogs break peoples knees?
