And your dad's there, FFS!", " NTA. You were only telling the truth and doesn\u2019t sound like you were cruel about it in any way", "NTA. It doesn't surprise me at all that your mother can't accept basic facts. I'm glad she admitted to her mistakes, but she needs to work on them. That work may take the rest of her life. She could've offered to guide you through one of her recipes calmly instead of stalking off. She didn't. That's not on you.", "Info: If your dad is there to take care of her why are you there?", "NTA. What you said was actually quite kind, given the sort of abuse she heaped on you while she was teaching you to cook. You didn't rub that in at all, & an asshole definitely would have. It's up to you whether you apologize for the sake of keeping the peace or not \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f if she's ever apologized to you for the awful way she treated you, it may be worth doing.", "NTA. If it really hurt mom's feelings, maybe have a discussion with her that since she's realized her past was wrong and apoligized, maybe she can try again now and you guys could make something together she likes to cook (sounds like cooking is important to her and she's important to you).", "NTA.  And if they don't want Japanese food then your dad can cook.  I assume his arm isn't broken.\n\nOr if you're up to it, maybe your mom can walk you through a new dish instead of complaining about it.\n\nMight be time to move out again...", "NTA\n\nYou've been there, helping and didn't bring it up. Honestly if you're taking care of someone they should really be grateful to eat whatever is in front of them.", "NTA...\n\nIt doesn't sound like you were trying to hurt your mom, you're just telling her how it is... she was probably just surprised at the lasting impact her behavior had... sometimes the truth hurts... I don't think you need to apologize...", "NTA. Mom needs to take accountability IMO.\n\nAlso, you cooking for her should be enough for her to feel grateful. IIRC Your father is there too and even he could cook up something.", "NTA \n\nWhy can\u2019t your dad cook for your mom? If he asks you to apologize you can remind him that you honestly answered a question your mom asked and didn\u2019t berate her like she always did to you. Also, ask him to cook non Japanese food from now on to keep her wife happy.", "My mom didn\u2019t teach me any cooking tips either, I\u2019m currently learning on my own. So I understand the frustration of that situation. Next time she asked for some thing other than Japanese food, maybe you should ask, will you teach me how to make the dish she would like?\nNTA", "NTA - the truth can hurt sometimes. She asked a question that you kindly answered and she pestered you further because the answer hurt her. Your response to that could have been way worse. She\u2019s likely hurt from the guilt because it sounds like she\u2019s made attempts in the past to make amends for it. You might consider going to her and saying something along the lines of \u201cwhat I said is the truth and I had no intention for the truth to hurt you and for that I\u2019m sorry.\u201d", " NTA\n\nHow do you get tired of Japanese food\u2026.?", "NTA. She taught you how to get anxious in a kitchen. You actually learned to cook with your fianc\u00e9.", "NTA. you moved in and cooked, that's very generous", "NTA. I come from a mixed family and always cook the food my dads family ate.\n\nShe's jealous and lacks awareness. She made you uncomfortable and you enjoy more complexity in your food. You arent an AH. She should be grateful youre helping out and find it interesting and, as a supportive mother, ask to teach her so you can make POSITIVE memories.", "NTA and why isn\u2019t her husband, your dad helping out?", "Nta, your mom asked a question and she didn\u2019t like the answer for she her terrible parenting is the reason why. When you make mistakes as parents expect it to come up. You didn\u2019t do it in a malicious way.", "NTA \nIt\u2019s hard admitting to your failures. But doing so is incredible progress. Even then it\u2019s very hard when the results of your failures are presented to you throughout the course of your life and you are forced to revisit and process these things in real time. Sometimes you need a minute, or hour or day to come to grips. It\u2019s good that your mom can admit that she failed in some ways. Don\u2019t be upset with your mom. Being mature enough to know that you need to remove yourself and process is a good thing. She didn\u2019t lash out or pass blame. She exited. People are often accused of \u201cescaping\u201d uncomfortable situations when what they\u2019re doing is simply removing themselves so that they can process and sometimes avoid doing things that they know they\u2019ll regret. Not enough people remove themselves when they should. But your mom did. You\u2019re NTA and your mom doesn\u2019t sound like she is either", "NAH. It sounds like everyone was trying to do the right thing and no one was being an asshole. You were honest about why you cook the food that you do, and your mom likely felt hurt because it reminded her of her shortcomings in teaching you. Your dad was right to suggest that you apologize to keep the peace, but it doesn't sound like you were wrong for speaking the truth.", "NTA\n\nMy mother, even though is a great mom, could not for the love of God wait for me to do things. She would always get angry at how slowly I moved. And even though she did taught me how to cook, I still couldn't do it. I had to learn myself at 22. So her teaching you doesn't mean that you actually learned.", "_Oh, so we have the same mother?!_", "NTA, but maybe now that you\u2019ve learned techniques from your fianc\u00e9, you can start learning other cuisines. The principles are very similar.", "Nta.\n\nWhy is your mom's feelings hurt? Loss of pride or a crushed ego? \n\nLet's take look:\n\n1.She chose to adopt the role of your cooking instructor. 2.She wasn't good at what she does and was fairly abusive and she admits she wasn't the best.\n\nTerrible teachers haven't earned a right to inculcate a massive ego. No ifs, buts, whens or how. You, as the student, do not reciprocate that type of treatment inflicted upon you years ago with kindness, and / or with an apology after telling them the truth. This is the type of behavior that breeds stockholm syndrome.\n\nNo. I don't care if it's a mother, a father, Uncle Elmer or your significant other. So long as someone has been an ass to you, nothing comes across as sincerely apologetic enough without starting off with THEIR word of apology.\n\nWhere's her apology for calling you 'stupid'?", "NTA\n\nBut your fiance is right.  Go for the peace I think is a good idea.", "ESH - She could have just been grateful you are there helping her and cooking her wholesome meals. Would have avoided thr whole debacle.\n\nAt the same time, you probably could have been a bit nicer. Going by the post, sounds like the experiences were some time ago and that at this stage in your life it is water under the bridge? If so there was no need to bring it back up. If she is still snappy with you regularly though then I'd say you were justified and NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You said she owned up to it. While you don't have any obligation to give her a pass on all of it until the end of time, I don't think it was necessary to say what you said in this situation.\n\nIt doesn't sound to me like she had a particularly entitled attitude when asking her question, but your mom is still being a bit of a choosy beggar here imo. If she doesn't like what you're cooking, she can either ask someone else, order in, or make something herself one-handed.\n\nApologize for hurting her feelings, and then drop it. If she wants to play the victim from that point, you can lay all your still-hurt feelings out for her then.", "YTA - It's not your job to coddle your mom and stoke her ego, however it's not going to change the past or help the future to hurt her feelings about it now. \n\nYou aren't a total AH.. but more lacking tact.", "I get initially only knowing how to cook Japanese food but if you've mastered that most people move on to other different cuisines.

Stating a fact? \n\nShe was supposed to say, pretty please?", "Well put!\n\nOP, YTA. It would've been better if you had worded it in a little less \"accusatory\" way. You say that she has admitted to being a bit of an AH (my words) while you were growing up, so this isn't a case of an AH parent getting put in her place now that the child is an adult. I think an apology for hurting her feelings is in order. If she accepts your apology and doesn't make excuses for her past behavior, let it go. If she uses your apology as an opportunity to argue with you over the validity of your feelings about her past actions, that's when you can lay it all out for her.", "NTA you cook what you are comfortable making. \n\nYou could try to make other food google some recipes etc. I suggest Alton Brown he is very detailed in his recipes. \n\nIf not go buy frozen meals like lasagna etc just to make it easier on yourself.", "Did your Mum should teach him?", "What do you need to do for your mom that she can't do herself?", "Cooking, cleaning taking care of the dog, it\u2019s her dominate hand that\u2019s broken so she just needs some assistance with things"]}
