You were honest about why you cook the food that you do, and your mom likely felt hurt because it reminded her of her shortcomings in teaching you. Your dad was right to suggest that you apologize to keep the peace, but it doesn't sound like you were wrong for speaking the truth.", "NTA\n\nMy mother, even though is a great mom, could not for the love of God wait for me to do things. She would always get angry at how slowly I moved. And even though she did taught me how to cook, I still couldn't do it. I had to learn myself at 22.

No ifs, buts, whens or how. You, as the student, do not reciprocate that type of treatment inflicted upon you years ago with kindness, and / or with an apology after telling them the truth.

She chose to parent you through verbal/emotional abuse when it came to teachable moments. She is upset because she is now reaping what she sowed (so to speak). I'm glad you were able to grow up and met individuals who were kind and patient and nurturing. You don't owe your mom custom-cooked meals to her liking. She has a broken arm, but her other arm works fine and she can use her one arm and toss a frozen meal in the microwave. Her husband can also make her meals ahead of time and she can reheat them as needed when he is at work. Your parents aren't helpless and they obviously feel entitled to your assistance. I would remind them that there are alternatives they can be doing if the generous help you are providing is not to their standard. Also, remind your dad that the truth hurts, so if your mother's feelings are hurt, perhaps she should do some self reflection.

But isn\u2019t it true you are sorry it hurt her feelings? But she\u2019s mom and you love her so are there to help? Mom stay out of the kitchen when you cook. A compromise sounds reasonable on both sides. Instant mashed potatoes if you don\u2019t want to make the real deal. Gravy mixes. Bake maybe pieces of chicken. Set a timer and not slave over a stove. Baked potatoes. Crockpot recipes online. Toss all in and slow cook and go about your business. And still make Japanese food but not all the time for them. Sorry she was so critical as you were growing up. Her admitting it. Maybe that is a good thing. Adding that for many years I cooked and had my husband walk food over to his mom\u2019s.

I remember my aunt broke her arm still took care of an infant and a 6yo cooked and cleaned the house bc she had her husband there to help.", "Yeah, this. Not to play pain Olympics, but I broke both of my hips this year (requiring a total replacement) and while my boyfriend was my sole caregiver, I was cool with him going back to work afterr like one extra day. When I literally could not walk. I'm an adult who figured my shit out (with a walker, so fun)\n\nBecause that's how shit goes. I don't have much sympathy for treating family like crap because one arm is a bit owie.\n\nSo NTA.", "I don't think the dad knows how to cook, given that OP mentions that only their mom could teach them", "Space out the Y T A or it looks like that\u2019s your vote.", "You're there to help, not to be mistreated and pulled down or emotionally abused by your mother (again). \nNTA but your mother needs to learn to be grateful, thanks to you she has food to eat now but if she doesn't like the food you cook then don't cook for her.", "But he can still cook and put food in the refrigerator for your mom to heat. You can use a microwave even with a broken arm.", "Its a broken arm, she isnt paralyzed. I know you want to help but ffs its not that big of a deal", "This is known as weaponised incompetence. If he had to cook, he could.", "There are always frozen foods. We keep lasagna in the freezer for when we don't feel like cooking, for example.\nThere is a great variety of meals she can take straight from the freezer and nuke in the microwave oven. She can eat them whenever she wants and he can feed himself when he gets home.", "Maybe OP\u2019s mom can use this as an opportunity to teach OP\u2019s dad how to cook?", "House is just full of broken arms!", "Nope she broke his arm\u2026because I\u2019m sure she does everything for him. Which is why they all knew he couldn\u2019t be relied on to take came of mom.", "Both of them? \n\nETA I say that as an incredulous retort, ie the only way OP\u2019s dad could justifiably not be making food. Not as a wish or anything", "His only arm", "It\u2019s my favorite punctuation.  \n\nMy goal is to get my kids to use them properly in their work.  Just drop a \u203d once in a while.", "No one said she was. Her mom is probably reflecting back and feels horrible she didn\u2019t teach her. Mom wasn\u2019t ready. They never are. It\u2019s rarely nice. Let the pimple pop.", "Don't you know? You gotta only do stuff for you, yourself and and the guy you see in the mirror. Anyone who disagrees is parentifying you.", "Well he can. Just badly.", "Not defending the father's treatment of OP, but stop with the creating your own narrative with no support and making a judgment based off of it. I do all the cleaning and grocery shopping but I'm a terrible cook. I just am (I refer to it at culinarily declined). Just as some people are naturally talented at things, some people are especially bad, and Dad could easily be one of them. It's become a real problem on this sub for people to make stuff up and judge based off of it, and it brings the whole sub down.", "Screw that guy in the mirror. He's ugly as shit.", "Most people will help their parents. But if my parents had acted like OPs parents I would tell them they're on their own. If you abuse your child you shouldn't be surprised if they don't want to help you. The mom also has a husband. If he hasn't learned to cook by now in his fifties or sixties it's well past time that he does.", "Well, that's pretty narcissistic!", "Oh my heart, how I try so hard to break the cycle and parent my kid better, but sometimes I just know I\u2019m doing something wrong without knowing what\u2026 I totally expect my child one day to sit on a therapists couch and blame mom even though sincerely and from all my heart I\u2019m giving him my everything. My brain and heart hurt as I always am trying to maintain a good connection with my little everything, but mom is mom, mom is everything and nothing, I only realized how hard my mom had it when I became a mom. Here is my idea, one day when my little everything comes to me and says mom you did 1 2 3 I will try my best to swallow my hurt and say how can we fix this. Do you think you can possibly give mom the benefit of the doubt and ask if she can teach you her favorite dishes that she\u2019d like to eat?", "Why can\u2019t your dad cook for her?", "\"Mom, I didn't intend to hurt your feelings. For that I apologize. I was simply trying to answer your question and the answer came out more harshly than intended.\"", "NTA", "My partner taught me how to drive and cook. He still does most of the cooking because he's a better driving instructor than cooking instructor. I like to cook my own specific meals. My mom never got on me for my cooking or driving. She tried to teach me both and it didn't stick. To me, your mom is being dramatic. My mom is proud af of both of our skills. She praises my deviled eggs and his Cream style corn. She's focused on herself vs. What you've built", "NTA. The truth hurts sometimes.", ">My fianc\u00e9 said I\u2019m not completely in the wrong but I should apologize to keep the peace.\n\nDoes she want your help or not? Because if she does, she needs to accept her actions caused issues and let it go. Your dad can't help your mom? NTA and they're still assholes.", "NTA. Time for you to take a break and just go back home. Your father can cook for her.", "So, she's still finding fault with cooking?!?!  NTA", "NTA. \n\nAlso, unless dad also broke his arm, he should probably get his $hit together and take care of mom himself.", "YTA. I would hurt also if I was your mother. I feel bad for her.", "Your guilty but not enough to be the ass", "NTA. She owes you an apology. Not the other way around.", "NTA  she asked you a question and you answered honestly. You didn\u2019t deny that she taught you things heck you agreed. She knows who she is, she knows why you cook what you cook. Shes just upset with herself because she\u2019s just been given hard proof of what her verbal abuse did. That\u2019s a hard pill to swallow for the few who try to get better. I hope she keeps getting better and you both heal.", "NTA, you were nice enough to stay at their house even though your mom only has a broken arm. Does your dad just not exist? Is he physically incapable of cooking? That environment sounds toxic and I would dip if I were you OP, you've done enough for them", "Gentle YTA. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 is right. What you said was truthful,  but it wasn't really necessary.  It was intentionally hurtful and served no purpose, except to be hurtful. Understandable,  to be sure.... but not right.\n\nYou should apologize to your mom.\n\nETA: This is meant in no way to be supportive of mom's behavior.  It's addressing the question at hand. Sometimes, letting the thoughts in your head, as true as they may be, fall out of your mouth makes YTA.", "NTA but if Mom can do a little bit to help, now would be a good time for her to teach you some of the things she makes. You are confident now in the kitchen and just have a calm discussion with her before you start that if she yells or calls you stupid or anything similar, she is having ramen noodles again or can call for a pizza.", "NTA, maybe she should have been a better parent and you wouldn't have made her upset by pointing this out\n\nI broke contract with my mom when i was 19 because she was horrible to me, my brothers tell me she loves playing the victim still, people don't want to see themselves as the bad guy", "Couldn't mom have just ordered a pizza and given OP a night off?", "I mean, she brought it up because she asked OP then OP credited the person who actually taught her and mom wasn't pleased at that. Was OP supposed to just lie?", "That literally is verbal abuse OP.", "Yeah, my mom fell and broke her arm right below the shoulder joint, and they couldn't put it in a cast, so she was just in a sling until it healed. Breaks like that are a little more of a problem to do anything with, especially in the beginning but we have no knowledge here if that was the kind of break OP's mom had. \n\nThat being said, I'm the kind of person who would temporarily move home to help my mom out if she broke her arm again, even for an easier/castable break. I don't think I *owe* her anything, but I love her and want to help her when I can. My upbringing also wasn't the greatest, and my mom was/is overly critical a lot of the time, but I still love her. She's my mom. 95% of our interactions are great, and I'm an adult who can deal with the 5% they aren't (which at this point is mostly her getting huffy my sister and I do things our way instead of hers). Is she absolutely ridiculous and eye roll worthy sometimes, and sometimes causes my anxiety to spike hard? Well yeah, but again I'm an adult who can deal with that.", "Mad sympathy.  My wife had a dog break her tibial plateau two months ago and is just now walking again.  \n\n\nAmazingly I've been able to handle the chores for both of us, including cooking, without a third person moving in.", "Hell, even if he did, between them they have two working arms! If Hawkeye and the Colonel could perform surgery together on M*A*S*H with two broken arms, these guys could cook some pasta or something LOL", "Now, now, you know his penis gets in the way when he tries to cook.", "How is helping your mom out make her a slave o.O I get she was mean when younger but she acknowledged that and said she felt bad. mom\u2019s out of commission at the moment and needs help. There\u2019s nothing wrong with forgiving and forgetting.\n\nSaying she\u2019s tired of daughters food makes mom TA but damn y\u2019all would really treat your parents like that?", "[deleted]", "*sighs*\n\n*unzips*", "Let's not go down that road.", "I get that now. I thought you were referring to the infamous reddit story where OP broke both his arms and his mom helped him uh... satisfy his \"needs\".", "I believe it was a major not the colonel. I might be wrong, but I think it was that doctor who came for quick visits to see what a Mash was like and help with new techniques. \n\nHawkeye and him got along but also didn't just can't remember the character", "Lol I love \u201clet the pimple pop\u201d", "Now I'm curious please link the post", "It's too late.", "It might have been a major, but for some reason I thought he was a Colonel. But you're right, he had been on a previous episode of the show,, and he and Hawkeye didn't get along. I do know that the actor playing him was Alan Alda's father, and Alan Alda wrote that episode to kind of resolve some issues they had had over the years. Another interesting fact, the aid station medic that yells at them to stop fighting and to help was played by Alan Alda's half brother.", "Presumably, OP's mother was alright when she wasn't trying to teach any skills? Like, OP didn't list all the situations where her mom was a normal mom, but I'm assuming that's because they were not relevant to the topic of this AITA, not because they didn't exist.", "In searching for it I remembered how truly disturbing it is and felt bad for mentioning it in the first place.
