It sounds like everyone was trying to do the right thing and no one was being an asshole. You were honest about why you cook the food that you do, and your mom likely felt hurt because it reminded her of her shortcomings in teaching you. Your dad was right to suggest that you apologize to keep the peace, but it doesn't sound like you were wrong for speaking the truth.", "NTA\n\nMy mother, even though is a great mom, could not for the love of God wait for me to do things. She would always get angry at how slowly I moved. And even though she did taught me how to cook, I still couldn't do it. I had to learn myself at 22.

No ifs, buts, whens or how. You, as the student, do not reciprocate that type of treatment inflicted upon you years ago with kindness, and / or with an apology after telling them the truth.

She chose to parent you through verbal/emotional abuse when it came to teachable moments. She is upset because she is now reaping what she sowed (so to speak). I'm glad you were able to grow up and met individuals who were kind and patient and nurturing. You don't owe your mom custom-cooked meals to her liking. She has a broken arm, but her other arm works fine and she can use her one arm and toss a frozen meal in the microwave. Her husband can also make her meals ahead of time and she can reheat them as needed when he is at work. Your parents aren't helpless and they obviously feel entitled to your assistance. I would remind them that there are alternatives they can be doing if the generous help you are providing is not to their standard. Also, remind your dad that the truth hurts, so if your mother's feelings are hurt, perhaps she should do some self reflection.

But isn\u2019t it true you are sorry it hurt her feelings? But she\u2019s mom and you love her so are there to help? Mom stay out of the kitchen when you cook. A compromise sounds reasonable on both sides. Instant mashed potatoes if you don\u2019t want to make the real deal. Gravy mixes. Bake maybe pieces of chicken. Set a timer and not slave over a stove. Baked potatoes. Crockpot recipes online. Toss all in and slow cook and go about your business. And still make Japanese food but not all the time for them. Sorry she was so critical as you were growing up. Her admitting it. Maybe that is a good thing. Adding that for many years I cooked and had my husband walk food over to his mom\u2019s.

I had my shoulder repaired (both actually a year apart) and I stayed with my parents a couple days (less than a week) since the initial pain was awful and I was a single mom to a little boy. Best believe I found I can use chopsticks with both hands and write left handed, but only on a white board lol", "Seriously! I remember my aunt broke her arm still took care of an infant and a 6yo cooked and cleaned the house bc she had her husband there to help.", "Yeah, this. Not to play pain Olympics, but I broke both of my hips this year (requiring a total replacement) and while my boyfriend was my sole caregiver, I was cool with him going back to work afterr like one extra day. When I literally could not walk. I'm an adult who figured my shit out (with a walker, so fun)\n\nBecause that's how shit goes. I don't have much sympathy for treating family like crap because one arm is a bit owie.\n\nSo NTA.", "I don't think the dad knows how to cook, given that OP mentions that only their mom could teach them", "Space out the Y T A or it looks like that\u2019s your vote.", "You're there to help, not to be mistreated and pulled down or emotionally abused by your mother (again). \nNTA but your mother needs to learn to be grateful, thanks to you she has food to eat now but if she doesn't like the food you cook then don't cook for her.", "But he can still cook and put food in the refrigerator for your mom to heat. You can use a microwave even with a broken arm.", "Its a broken arm, she isnt paralyzed. I know you want to help but ffs its not that big of a deal", "This is known as weaponised incompetence. If he had to cook, he could.", "There are always frozen foods. We keep lasagna in the freezer for when we don't feel like cooking, for example.\nThere is a great variety of meals she can take straight from the freezer and nuke in the microwave oven. She can eat them whenever she wants and he can feed himself when he gets home.", "Maybe OP\u2019s mom can use this as an opportunity to teach OP\u2019s dad how to cook?", "House is just full of broken arms!", "Nope she broke his arm\u2026because I\u2019m sure she does everything for him. Which is why they all knew he couldn\u2019t be relied on to take came of mom.", "Both of them?", "His only arm", "It\u2019s my favorite punctuation.  \n\nMy goal is to get my kids to use them properly in their work.  Just drop a \u203d once in a while.", "No one said she was. Her mom is probably reflecting back and feels horrible she didn\u2019t teach her. Mom wasn\u2019t ready. They never are. It\u2019s rarely nice. Let the pimple pop.", "Don't you know? You gotta only do stuff for you, yourself and and the guy you see in the mirror. Anyone who disagrees is parentifying you.", "Well he can. Just badly.", "Not defending the father's treatment of OP, but stop with the creating your own narrative with no support and making a judgment based off of it. I do all the cleaning and grocery shopping but I'm a terrible cook. I just am (I refer to it at culinarily declined). Just as some people are naturally talented at things, some people are especially bad, and Dad could easily be one of them. It's become a real problem on this sub for people to make stuff up and judge based off of it, and it brings the whole sub down.", "Screw that guy in the mirror. He's ugly as shit.", "Most people will help their parents. But if my parents had acted like OPs parents I would tell them they're on their own. If you abuse your child you shouldn't be surprised if they don't want to help you. The mom also has a husband. If he hasn't learned to cook by now in his fifties or sixties it's well past time that he does.", "Well, that's pretty narcissistic!"]}
