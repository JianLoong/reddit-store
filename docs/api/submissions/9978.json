That goes double on Valentine's Day.", "Info: Are you at the restaurant right this second?", "I would definitely ask the management to address the situation with the family. I waited tables for years and I had managers that would go over and try and distract a kid so they would stop screaming so everyone could get a quiet meal", "NTA.  I love kids.  I\u2019m the eldest of all my siblings, cousins, etc.  I know that sometimes kids cry and there\u2019s nothing you can do to stop it.\n\nThat said, my parents always told us (and other new parents who asked for advice) that whenever one of us would start fussing in public places like restaurants (which was rare but did happen), one of them would pick us up and take us outside the venue until we calmed down if we wouldn\u2019t stop fussing in the actual venue.  When an old friend of my dad\u2019s had his first baby and he and his wife were overwhelmed and embarrassed when their newborn started to act up at a nicer restaurant, they gave them that advice too, and it worked like a charm.  Not only is it better for the parents, it\u2019s actually better for the baby, who might be overstimulated and therefore likely to quiet/calm down a lot quicker when removed from the excess of stimuli.", "Are you\u2026 writing this in the middle of your date???", "NTA if this is a nice restaurant/not McDonalds. If they aren\u2019t doing anything to try and stop the screaming then yes. Also you can ask your waiter/the manager to say something if you feel it\u2019s not your place.", "NTA. While if this was any other day, and trust me I get it, Id say suck it up but this is a day meant for people to go out and have atleast semi romantic evenings and dates. You're not at a Dennys or a waffle house, and the parents should have more control over their kid. I have a baby sister and my dad wouldve corrected her just like he corrected me and my brothers at that age.", "I would ask to be moved if possible but if not then a quiet word with a member of staff?

Their desire for a meal out doesn't trump everyone else's right to a peaceful meal. I'll say this though.... The fact that no one that works there has addressed it says a lot about that place.

Besides being taken outside for a few minutes to calm down is actually a valid coping mechanism for when things get too much which is probably why this kid is screaming so much.", "That's perfectly fine. I have no problem with children existing in public.  See it's not usually the kids I take issue with when they mis-behave, after all they're children who don't know any better, have zero sense of personal space or what it means to be considerate of others beyond themselves.  They're about as self aware as a dog licking its butthole in the middle of a crowded room.\n\nIt's shitty parents who fail in teaching and guiding their kids that I take issue with.  Your child may be YOUR entire world, but that same child is barely a blip on the radar in mine.  Your rude, mis-behavin kids are not mine or anyone else's problem to deal with.  They're yours. Hard stop.  You, the parent must teach and guide them on how to operate and behave in society.  If you can't/won't guide your kids or at the very least keep them in line, stay home and make mac and cheese swimming in ketchup.  You'll save money and people won't think you're an asshole.

Cheese hard with that one.", "I really doubt it was 20 minutes (again, industry person here - when people say shit like \"I  WAITED FOR A HALF HOUR FOR XYZ\" they are basically always wrong by half at most - it does feel like that though). And also, the specific reason why I used the term \"poorly behaved parents\" and not \"kids\" is because I actually agree. There does reach a point where a parent needs to consider their environment regardless of where they are. But a fellow patron is  for sure not going to be the person to persuade them, in fact it's usually the opposite.", "This is the best point. I stand corrected lol."]}
