You need to find a way to not need his child support money.  A work from home job or whatever.  This situation will cause emotional harm to your son as he gets older.", "Any chance you could reach out to his mom and invite her over to start getting to know your son? This way it\u2019s in a controlled environment and you guys could start building a relationship?\n\nIt\u2019s going to be one of the hardest things you ever do, but she will be in your sons life for the next 20 years and, the sooner you can start to build those bridges, the easier that time will become. On the plus side, the more you and she can work it out, the less the lawyers fees will be.", "Thanks xx", "Sorry this is happening to you.", "I cancelled the child support arrangemen months ago but he still sends it.", "I tried that at the start, his mum and sister were not nice at all and sided with him for everything, criticised everything I did - and after my facebook status they both blocked me so those bridges are burnt now. It's a mess and I hate the situation I'm in so much. It's hard to cope with the worry of being painted as the one in the wrong after suffering so much in pregnancy and postpartum, but can only blame myself for writing things online I guess", "You were struggling, it\u2019s understandable. In your requests, include that you would like to do some coparenting classes with all of them. Make it clear that you are willing to do the work to provide a stable long-term situation for your son. These courts see so much, toxic drama, that the more reasonable and mature you come across, the more concessions, you are likely to get. You haven\u2019t mentioned money at all, but make sure that if they want to go down through the courts that you add on child support as well.", "Thanks i will add that to my notes. Do you think a diagnosis of postnatal depression would go in my favour to make the judge go easier on me? I had to have a cesarean 3 weeks early because my mood was so low as a result of what he was putting me through (even demanded a DNA test at the 8th month as a way to have no responsibility for as long as possible, hadn't mentioned the need for a test before. He only asked for it to turture me further). How much do these things influence a judge's approach do you think?", "Wow lady! Take it easy. I was in your shoes, my ex had so successfully made me think that I'm incapable, that a months after he was already my ex, I've had paranoia that the judge will come and take my child. You did your best all this months alone. Most judges will never oversee that, most judges know, that usually the mother is the one in right. Your ex is gaslighting you and still abusing you. Go in court and say, that you're proud with your Facebook status, because it's true. \nAnd  don't overthinking , no-one cares about your Facebook status, except your ex, because it's true."]}
