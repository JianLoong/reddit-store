For any other guests in the family other than OP I'm 100% ok with saying that's the thing to do, is just reply no. It sounds like the couple cares more about having the wedding they want with their friends around them than if Uncle Billy-Bob and Aunt Martha-Mae show up. \n\nI do get why OP would be put off here, and don't have a good solution for this circumstance, or even a good judgement here. The rest of the family can kick rocks though with their expectations, as the couple clearly wants to celebrate in their own way. I get if others don't want to be there, so then just don't be there. Nudity doesn't mean sexual, and that's clearly an issue many people here in the comments can't separate, but that's not the wedding couple's fault, it's a systemic part of American society as a whole, the idea of being uncomfortable with nudity.\n\nIn European settings it's common for family members, friends, and even coworkers to visit bath houses with steam rooms, hot tubs, and other similar settings, fully nude, together in a co-ed, or even familial, setting. We on this side of the pond just haven't been acculturated that way, hence the replies you are seeing on this thread. OP is really the only one caught in a rough place here with these plans, but perhaps it may have behooved them to ask more questions about the wedding before committing $10k of their own money to a project that they knew they wouldn't have the final say on. We are well past that point now, and it's clear the wedding couple finds doing things their way more important than taking OP's money, so at least they are very clear on the clothing optional part being very important to them. If they are willing to pay for their own wants and desires I see no problem here at all.", "\ud83d\ude06\n\nI was hoping our nudist will tell.

For number two, my personal opinion which is just mine, yes I am uncomfortable with sleeveless tops or dresses for men or women, particularly around buffets and things I do feel very few people have attractive upper arms and very often I've seen very sweaty underarms, it's just my ick factor and I keep it to myself. The only time in my life I said anything about it was for my wedding and my maid of honor, and let her pick any dress she wanted and just asked her please for it not to be sleeveless. I was my sister's only bridesmaid, she knew how I felt about sleeveless and she chose a sleeveless dress, I didn't say a word, I put it on I smiled the whole day and then wrapped it up and placed it in my closet, because I know this is my concern and unless somebody's getting hurt my opinions are kept to myself.", "It implies they were only invited because they were paying.

With those stats it's very likely for at least once perv in the family.

Yes I do know bride is not a child, and high chance she was never abused as a child, the stats just show there is a high level of abusers and people who probably don't act on it. \n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/childsexualabuse/fastfact.html", "Sorry but I don\u2019t believe you.

They're going to *actively despise you* and you will destroy any relationship you have with them.\n\nIf you're not lying about being older than a teenager you've probably already irreparably damaged some relationships with people around you. People at work get promoted ahead of you. People talk about you behind your back. Rooms go quiet when you walk in. You probably have a handful of friends that have just normalised your pedantry or they've heard enough to just filter it out.\n\nBut it's not too late to change.", "I'm sorry to hear about that, but this post has no sign of that, and it is a child free over 18's wedding only so no children will be present either. A lot of people will be against it because they aren't comfortable with nudity, which is fine", "Sorry, but I'm very deliberate and use my words carefully.", "I know children will not be present. I'm not saying children are going to be abused. I'm saying in general if there's so MANY abusers willing to commit a crime to abuse children, imagine how many people are willing to sexualize a young adult.\n\nI also said there will be people who are comfortable just based solely on the fact they are comfortable with seeing people naked and WILL sexualize the bride and groom. My partners family, all great people, love each other a ton, no abuse in the family and everyone gets along great. \n\nWe took a trip to a nudist beach by mistake and every uncle and of age male went to the beach to oogle naked women and the women and children of the family (who I was with) saw the naked people and they just took a u turn and waited for the men to finish their \"walk\". I was shocked and surprised.\n\n Also my last experience of sexual abuse happened from a family friend who baby sat me my entire life, he was my dad's best friend, their dads were best friends and he's kinda slightly extended family, he did it when I was 18, not when I was a child. In the backseat of a van, while my parents were driving. So people are really ballsy and fucked. Some people just wait for you to grow up to sexually abuse you in a less fucked up way."]}
