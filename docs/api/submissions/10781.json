And a wedding with alcohol and dancing (presumably) is not a great place to start with newbies. \n\nThey should totally do a separate ceremony and invite those who would like to attend nude. It\u2019s very spiritual and I can totally understand wanting to connect with your spouse on that level.

Them turning around and saying \"ok but you'll have to be exposed to nudity\" is basically the same as saying \"ok but you're not invited\". That's not about strings attached, it's just common sense.

They can do what they want with their wedding, but you don't have to pay for a wedding that will probably end up being only for their friends that are naturists.
