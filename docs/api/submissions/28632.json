However, my daughter got really upset about the gift she recieved compared to her brothers, and now she won't talk to me.\n\nHere's the deal: For my son's birthday, I bought him a car. It's a used one, nothing fancy, but it's a reliable vehicle to get him around. On the other hand, for my daughter's birthday, I gifted her a $300 Visa gift card. \n\nNow, I understand that on the surface, this might seem unfair. But hear me out. My son has shown a strong interest in cars for years, and he's been saving up for one. He's responsible and has a part-time job, so I thought it was a good time to help him get one. He was thrilled, and we even went car shopping together.\n\nMy daughter, on the other hand, never expressed any particular interest in anything specific. She's more into shopping and fashion, which is why I thought a Visa gift card would give her the freedom to choose whatever she wants. Plus, she's been asking for extra money lately to buy clothes and makeup. However, when she opened her gift, she got visibly upset and called it unfair. She said it wasn't fair that her brother got a car, and she only got a gift card and that I was showing favoritism. \n\nI tried explaining my reasoning to her, but she wouldn't listen and stormed off to her room. She hasn't talked to me since. I think I did what was best for each of them based on their interests and needs, but now I'm wondering if I was wrong.
