I then spent the next almost 10 years planning to name my first son after him because he was my idol and best friend. He was the BIGGEST NERD. So when I got married, I walked down the aisle by myself to the indiana jones theme music to symbolize that he was still with me and \"giving me away.\" \n\nThe I got pregnant last year and finding out it's a boy! But by this point I didn't have the highest hopes for naming him after my dad because my husband's name is one that's been passed through his family for the last 4-5 generations, and while we were dating he said he wanted to keep that tradition. To my surprise, he suggested naming him after my dad with no hinting from me at all. I was over the moon and when we decided on his full name, we started telling our families. I would have sworn to you that we told everyone we were immediately related to within 2 weeks after we decided. \n\nThen we announced online that we were expecting and posted a little letter board with his name, our first ultrasound & the onesie we planned to bring him home in. \n\nBut then my sister (22F) basically ghosted me, and while we've had a rollercoaster of a relationship through the years, most recently she's been one of my closest friends, so I really didn't understand why. She stopped replying to my ig messages, was super short or didn't reply at all to my texts, stopped calling me, everything. \n\nFinally one day the dam breaks and she finally tells me that she found out about my son's name from our online announcement and she felt blindsided and like I purposely withheld the information from her until it was too late to \"back out\" so she just had to accept it. She said I didn't need her permission (implying that she had definitely expected me to ask) but she feels like I've now taken all of the meaningful ways to pay homage to him between my wedding and my son. I will say, I could have sworn I talked to her and mom about it at the same time, either when we were all together visiting or in the family group text.\n\nOur mom and I have both tried to tell her that it's totally not out of the ordinary for cousins to have the same first name of she wanted to name her kid after our dad, but she thinks this is ridiculous and doesn't want to be \"that kind of white people.\" There are also a ton of fandoms she can choose from to use to honor our dad when she gets married, but I chose the Indiana Jones theme bc it's tied to a very important core memory of me and my dad (it's not even my favorite fandom that he loved, I'm much more a trekkie.) But she didn't want to hear about any of that either. \n\nMy son is now 7 months old and she exclusively calls him by a cutesy nickname that doesn't resemble his name at all and I feel like it's because she still resents me for naming him after our dad. \n\nSo kind people of reddit, AITA for naming my son after my dad without checking with my sister first?", "created_utc": 1698541731, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17irwsi/aita_for_naming_my_son_after_my_dead_dad/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It seems like the name might trigger grief for her, yet that still doesn\u2019t mean you need her permission. Ideally, she\u2019ll get into therapy and will eventually \u201cforgive\u201d you - though a healthy person would respect that this is your way of dealing with grief and honoring your dad.\n\nInstead of taking responsibility for her own grief, she\u2019s decided to try to be controlling towards you, which isn\u2019t the best response. You can\u2019t control her either, so it\u2019s on her if and when she\u2019ll resume a relationship with you.", "No one owns a name. Who\u2019s to say your sister will even have a child, let alone a boy?  There\u2019s a million reasons she may not be able to have a child. Or she may have 12 girls. Sis is being over the top.", "NTA, she\u2019s definitely grieving still. Unfortunately grief makes people do and say really horrible things. I\u2019m sorry that she\u2019s behaving like that towards you\u2026 unfortunately you might either have to let it go yourself or try to sneak some therapy in there.", "NTA, grief as I\u2019m sure you know manifests in weird ways, my brother died when I was 15 and always wanted to name a son after him or Holden because Catcher in the Rye was his favorite book- I had three girls though so I used his middle name James as my second daughters middle name, at this point we weren\u2019t sure we would have a third so I wanted to make sure I\u2019d memorialized him some way in one of their names. When I got married I had a heart made out of his clothing and tucked it into my bouquet. My point being is there is a myriad of ways or things you can do to memorialize someone in big events. It\u2019s too bad that your sister is creating tension in the relationship, and as you said it\u2019s not uncommon for cousins to have the same or similar names - I have first cousins James and Jamey, and my brothers middle name was James all after my grandfather it sounds like your sister has some unresolved grief and perhaps the name triggers her - but those are her issues to deal with, not yours. Or, maybe this isn\u2019t about the name but she is jealous that you\u2019re married and have a baby; things she wished she was doing in life or she feels replaced or distanced from you - again, her issues to work through. But, your NTA it was your dad too and it\u2019s hard to lose a parent especially af such a young age and you shouldn\u2019t have to not do the things you had planned to do on the off chance she wanted to do it too. It\u2019s not like she was pregnant at the same time as you and was planning to use the name and you hurried and announced first so she couldn\u2019t. Sorry, you\u2019re going through this - congrats on the baby it goes by so fast! Soak up the time with him and enjoy the ride! I\u2019m sure your sister will come around", "nta but also as the 28 year old niece of an aunt who has always since childhood resented me for being named after someone who passed away before I was born, and who came to deeply counter-resent that aunt over time...\n\nyou might want to figure this out with your sister before the day comes that your son gets old and insightful enough to recognize that his aunt has never respected his existence for even a moment of his life.", "NTA you don't need to ask her permission for name but she entitled to her feelings.", "NTA. In a lot of cultures, it is customary to name babies after deceased family or friends.

The two of you are very close in age which means sibling rivalry can be a burden. A younger sister can constantly compare herself to her older sister and feel like she doesn't measure up.\n\nI would look for ways to appreciate her. Tell her what a great Aunt she is. Be supportive of her using the nickname which helps with the pain of the name. I think with time you can be close again. \n\nBuilding sibling relationships is about having enough positive experiences.

You also don't need to feel bad/concerned/guilty about doing a Indiana Jones motif to honor your father--sheesh.

I am so sorry for your loss. \n\nI do hope she comes around because I would hate for there to be lasting tension that my son starts to pick up on as he grows up.

I definitely want to totally resolve this with her before it ever comes to that, my biggest fear when I found out about her feeling hurt by the situation was that she would turn her frustration with me into resentment towards him. \n\nFor now when she interacts with him it's almost all positive, she just won't call him by his name, so I don't know how to address it and fix our relationship without opening a whole new can of worms...", "We're from the south eastern US, so I guess she thinks it would be playing into the \"white trash\" stereotype?

Perhaps the next opportunity will be at her wedding to ask her how you can help make your dad\u2019s presence feel more meaningful in some way and do your best to help make that happen or just get out of the way of whatever she wants to do involving your dad\u2019s memory even if what she wants to do offends you - as you perhaps didn\u2019t do with her in the case of your son\u2019s name. I mean if you think you shared it via a group chat that makes me think you didn\u2019t really consider her feelings cause you thought it wasn\u2019t a big deal."]}
