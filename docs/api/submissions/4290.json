My husband has done something similar a few times. I'd like to think he wouldn't open a special bottle that I'd been given as an award that literally had my name on it.  I could certainly see him finishing the bottle, though, if it were already open. \n\nI drink a little bit but not a lot.  I may have a drink if we go out to dinner or maybe one on a Saturday night at home if I feel like it.  My husband drinks more often than me (2 drinks 4-5 nights a week).  I don't buy alcohol very much but sometimes it is gifted to me.  \n\nRecently I went to a bridal shower that was cocktail themed and they gave party favors that were cans of interesting sounding cocktails.  I put them in the fridge after showing my husband what I got.  The next weekend I said something about trying one of the cocktails I was given that evening and he had this sheepish look on his face and admitted to drinking both of them already.  He also said he didn't think I wanted them because they were still there.  He then felt so badly about it that he went to the grocery store and bought me something else.  I was still annoyed even though he made an attempt to replace it. \n\nIt's not the first time that I went to make a drink and found it gone.  We have an alcohol cabinet above our fridge and I think if it is just sitting in there, he feels like it is free game just like food in the cabinet or refrigerator.

I have also asked him to ask me before he drinks say a bottle of wine that was given to me as a gift.", "NTA - so he opened your gift, consumed it all and then blamed you.\n\nThis is very selfish behaviour.\n\nOne thing to remember, is that this is not poor impulse control. He can control himself, but he can't do it with your possessions. Why does he allow himself to do that? \n\nThe other thing to do is to say what is good for the goose is good for the gander.\n\nShave your legs with his razor, steal all his socks and sweaters etc. It isn't a long-term solution, but sometimes it can push someone back from being an asshole if you really show it their face.", "NTA. \n\nThis one seemingly small incident tells a lot about his character, and its not good.

I have never cheated or anything, so one of the moments my wife probably thought of divorcing me is when I misunderstood the intended ownership of a pack of Reese's we purchased together.
