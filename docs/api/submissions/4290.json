I would have a hard time being partners with someone who doesn\u2019t give a shit about how I felt.", "Hands your BF was the T A in the.", "NTA... bf is an AH. You dont take someone elses gift.  Or special item.... you are allowed to buy something for yourself too. Your bf is revealing himself to you. Pay attention.", "NTA. That bottle was a gift for you and only you. That\u2019s like if a sweetheart bought me chocolates and my roommate ate them all then justified it by saying we share meals sometimes.", "NTA\n\nMakes sense that you would want to save the whiskey to drink on a special occasion. He could have at least told you he wanted to try it that way both of you could have partaken. He did the worst possible thing and drink it behind your back and act outraged when you were rightfully upset. It was given to you as a gift and he took it upon himself to disregard that. I can\u2019t get over that he drank the entire thing too that\u2019s so rude!", "NTA\n\nYour bf helped himself to your top shelf stuff and blamed you for his greed. It literally had your name on it and he drank the whole thing. He owes you a new bottle he cannot touch.", "NTA. Boyfriend is acting like an inconsiderate jerk. I\u2019m sure his opinion would change if it were you who solely consumed something that was gifted to him. He did not contribute to the whisky so he has no right to it. To drink all of it then place the blame on you us gluttonous and just plain rude. Boyfriend needs some manners", "I can't believe you're villainising your own actions as if your boyfriend didn't rob you and then accuse you of not enjoying yourself at *his pace* as some kind of justification for his theft?\n\nThis was a gift, not a treat you bought with shared finances. He didn't help you get good at your job or bring his expertise to the project you did exceptionally well on.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, your boyfriend is a total asshole. Don\u2019t forget that. You can do better", "NTA both hubby and i are whisky drinkers with an if its in the house its for drinking. but i would never just drink the three personalised rare bottles he has. if we are drinking together and he offer then yes i will have ine but not just helping myself. ita not just a pint of milk easily replaceable", "NTA. Does bf have issues limiting and managing his alcohol intake. This concerns me for a sign of alcoholism", "This was a gift, not community property, he had no right to drink it. He has stolen from you, and needs to pay you back. This is a series \ud83d\udea9, I would take a closer look at your relationship.", "NTA He stole from you and he owes you a duplicate bottle of expensive personalized whiskey.", "NTA my bf and I have a little home bar. He is the whiskey drinker, I barely like it. He likes to collect various ones and sometimes I get some as keepsakes. Not ONCE has he ever touched my whiskeys or other expensive liquors I've bought.  \n\nYour bf needs to learn boundaries, and if he wanted a nice whiskey, he should've gone out and bought it for himself. Until you opened it and offered him a drink he shouldn't have had a single sip. It's so rude of him to drink it all, then tell you to drink it faster next time.", "When I was dating my ex-husband I did notice that he drank a fair amount.He plowed through my bottles of gin, vodka, bourbon, and Scotch, also the Jamesons as well. I really didn't understand what all this meant.\n\nWhat it does mean is that my ex didn't ever savor a drink. He tucked away alcohol as if it was his job. Anything that I'd had that saved for savoring---like, for instance, the Jamesons---just went down the gullet same as any other drink.\n\nIt's a serious thing for a drinker to drink as if there's no pleasure in drinking. And that's how your BF treated that bottle you were waiting to sample. That's one red flag.\n\nAnd here's another: that bottle was obviously special to you. And yet, YF didn't ask you anything about it, such as : May I drink this? All of it?\n\nPay attention. It will become important later why this is important, if you let things get to that point.", "Seriously, what kind of whisky drinker drinks someone else\u2019s whisky without even asking permission?! Let alone a special one, given as a gift. I\u2019d be furious and demanding immediate restoration. \n\nNTA OP", "A whiskey stealing scallywag!  Nothing but store-brand vodka for that man until he pays up. NTA", "Yeah, nah. He needs to go out and replace it with his funds. That was a really shitty, inconsiderate, and disrespectful thing to do.", "But why do you think it's fair for you to help pay to replace something only he consumed? It's not. I don't know what standard of behaviour you're used to, but for him to suggest replacing the bottle he drank using joint funds sounds obnoxious to me.", "Hate to sound like a 90s Teen but newsflash!\n\nIf he's suggesting you replace the bottle using money from your joint/pooled finances, then he **is** mean with money. He drank your gift and now he's asking you to partially subsidize the replacement.", "Yes, bf should have copped to it, groveled a fair amount and replaced it with equal or better quality whiskey.\n\nI was a combatant in the Ice Cream Wars with my spouse about a decade ago, so I speak with some experience on this kind of situation.\n\nNOBODY wins the Special Treat skirmishes, whether rare cheeses, chocolate, whiskey, specialty ice cream, or whatever.  They escalate quickly and can really cause some hurt and angry feelings.  If he did not share in the buying of that bottle, it's not his to drink.", "He isn't worth the effort of mixing. Just make him drink Fireball.", "Hey,\n\nFamous Grouse is well respected abroad... \ud83d\ude06 ask me how I know.\n\nBut really, a lovely mid ' ish shelf spirit.", "Hmmm where\u2019d you get that from? Did you come up with that yourself\u2026..", "Well, it really fucking isn\u2019t. Especially whisky! I buy a nice bottle of whisky expecting to savour it over months, at my leisure. If I came back to find it gone before I\u2019d even touched it\u2026 not happy. And that\u2019s just a regular bottle - this was a personalised gift!", "So he gets to invent the rules for you both to live by?", "Yeah.. he's making up rules to suit his desires. I take a few days to work up to my snacks/treats. My SO knows I'm like this, rarely does he finish something he knows I want or is mine. If he's unsure, he asks me. Given that the product in question was alcohol, especially with your name on it, it's not his, and it was never was a shared thing. He's trying to justify himself being an AH by his \"avid whiskey drinker\" status. Don't cave, make him pay. Food/consumables is just one of those boundaries you don't mess with.", "That might fine for most things, but not for a special personalised gift. If he's having trouble understanding this concept you could explain it like this. Imagine that someone gave him (and only him) a $200 voucher as a Christmas present and you took the voucher and spent it all on things just for you. Without his permission. And didn't tell him until he went to use it to buy himself something nice. Do you think he'd be OK with that? I'm sure he'd say yes now, given the circumstances, but I'm also sure he'd be pretty annoyed. And I'm also sure that no normal person would do either of those things without feeling guilty as hell.", ">It\u2019s just as if beyond a certain time frame it\u2019s up for grabs.\n\nNormal couples who love each other don't level resources or perishables within an implicit threat in order to justify their own lack of restraint.\n\nNormal couples who love each other respect each other's valuables instead of creating resource anxiety within their spouse.\n\nIt's your gift - you should be allowed to enjoy it at your leisure and relax in the security your partner wouldn't dare to beat you to the quick with it.\n\nYour boyfriend's an AH and I'm sorry and afraid for you that you don't see that.", "How much did it cost?  just curious?", "Me and my husband do that, but we have a limit. If it\u2019s there for over a week, it\u2019s free game. We usually tell one another that we\u2019re eating it to give them one last chance to claim it. It\u2019s working so far.", "How is it for both of them anyway when it was a reward for her work?? Boyfriend is doing some real mental gymnastics to excuse his disgusting behaviour", "Or buy two bottles (once he replaces the bottle stolen with his own funds), then when the slowest drinker has finished their bottle, then 2 more bottles can be bought.  If the quicker drinker wants more booze before the slower one is done with their bottle, they can use their own money to supplement their booze needs.", "Sounds like a scam to me.", "My husband collects whiskey. I would never have any from one of his special bottles without him offering it to me to try, despite me buying many of them. It's mainly because I'm not the connoisseur he is, so will just drink the regular stuff, and partly because they belong to HIM, not me. This was a meaningful and personalised gift, so the partner equating it to other groceries and drinks that they share is just ridiculous! And then suggesting she just buy another bottle? Huh?? OP should buy him a nice bottle for his birthday or Christmas and then just drink it all while he's not looking. Absolutely NTA", "10 High and Mr. Pibb", "If it isn't common decency, it ought to be....and BF is still a guy who took and drank her entire bottle of special Scotch without mentioning it to her, or apologizing, or replacing it. That's really just bad form.", "And not just a rule, but a threat!", "As a matter of fact, even without that, ruder than ever. This is the kind of event that some time in the future, you will remember and realize you missed an important message.", "Maybe just very devious. He loves whisky... gets the 1st bottle free, drinks if all, gets gf to go halves on 2nd \"replacement\" bottle ;), drinks it, gets gf to go halves on 3rd \"replacement\" bottle, drinks it... ad infinitum. Then that's a lot of whisky $$  subsidies over time."]}
