Unacceptable behavior! He needs to replace and grovel for your forgiveness. If someone did this to me I'd have serious issues.", "NTA, and he's a thief.\n\nIt was a gift to you, he had no right to take it without your permission", "Absolutely NTA. That bottle was given to you as a gift for a job well done; the least he could have done is let you enjoy it.", "NTA\n\nHe should replace it, not you.", "NTA! He knew this was a gift to you and he helped himself to it. He's selfish and didn't save you any. Make him buy you a new bottle. Why should you replace what he stole? I'd also go back and really think if this is his first selfish act. If not, I'd think twice about continuing a life with this guy.", "NTA. This wasn't something you purchased together, this was a gift. He should have let you open it first.", "NTA\n\nWhat a prick. It's not a grocery joint purchase, it was a gift to you.", "**NTA** and your boyfriend is a real piece of work.\n\n>BF (who likes nice whisky) said it was available for both of us \n\nWas it, though? Really?\n\nYou were given an \"expensive, personalized\" GIFT. \n\nThat it happened to be a gift that was consumable is ethically irrelevant. It wasn't a food purchase from the grocery store. It wasn't bought out of your shared budget. It was a GIFT. Given specifically to YOU. Expensive and personalized to . . . you. And I don't get the impression, based on your response, that you did in fact make it \"available to\" him for his consumption. Or that he even bothered to ASK if it was available to him for his use, rather than just assuming that this gift that was not given to him was his for the taking.\n\nFurthermore, even if it HAD been \"available to\" him, he'd still be the AH for CONSUMING THE ENTIRETY of an expensive, personalized gift that was not given to him, but to you, not leaving any of it for you to enjoy at all. \n\n>and I should have drunk it more quickly.\n\nExcuse him? He actually said to you that you should have GOTTEN TO YOUR OWN GIFT FASTER IF YOU'D WANTED ANY OF IT? \n\nOh no. Absolutely not. \n\nThat man is literally the epitome of not only selfishness and greed, but tackiness, lack of basic manners, and failing to understand the basic kindergarten lesson of: \"Just because you want something does not mean that it is yours.\" \n\nYou are NTA, but your boyfriend needs to go back to preschool and learn some manners.", "NTA. This was something you *earned*, which is very different from something you bought. He should not have touched it without asking, and drinking all of it was extremely selfish and inconsiderate. \n\nIf he'd gotten a gold watch for work well done, would he be okay with you pawning it and using the cash to get something you liked? No, of course he wouldn't.", "NTA - \"You should have drunk it more quickly.\" -- This was not for him to decide. His actions were self-centered and not thoughtful.  When you love someone you tend to give them the better looking omelette, the bigger piece of cake, the preferred seat at a concert because you love them. I don't think he's truly into this connection. Best to you.", "NTA, but your BF is. Is he selfish in other ways?", "Ugh.. NTA but your bf is!!! That was a freaking gift! He shouldn't have even touched it unless he asked you 1st. What a selfish AH!!!", "NTA. It was a special gift for work you did, not him. That's different than shared food you buy for the household.  If it is something you really wouldn't buy, he should have been considerate and asked you if you minded. Especially rude he didn't realize he drank most of it and didn't save you any. He should replace it out of his funds.", "NTA\nIt's rare that work is shown appreciation and you should have been able to enjoy it.", "NTA and honestly I\u2019d dump his ass. To not even ask you? This event may seem trivial in the grand scheme of things, but to me it says A LOT about his character.", "NTA. That was a gift to you, specifically. It was yours to do with as you pleased. Your bf was and is way out of line for a) stealing your gift and b) telling you you're wrong to be upset about it.", "First off you\u2019re NTA ever for feeling how you feel. You can\u2019t control your feelings, only how you handle them. \n\nSecond, doubly NTA because it sounds like you handled this maturely and handled it like an adult. Your boyfriend sounds like a child.", "NTA; your BF is wrong. This was something special, given to *you*, not him, and isn't really replaceable. Yeah, I know, you could probably refill the bottle with the same whisky, (although, he drank it, why should *you* have to buy it?), but that's not the same. It won't be the actual whisky that was given to you.\n\nIt's easy enough to see how this is a problem. What would his reaction be if you consumed/made unavailable to him some item that was given to him, and he held special? Not good, I should think.\n\nYour BF is being deeply inconsiderate and then flippant on top of it. Not good qualities in a partner.", "NTA. I would be furious. That was a gift for YOU, and he didn't even ASK you about if he could have any? Or what it was? Dude, come on.", "Nta. Your bf was inconsiderate.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that he finished it off without once mentioning it to you shows how he feels about your belongings\u2026 they are HIS. He knew how expensive and nice the whisky was, this wasn\u2019t just an idiot mistake.", "NTA. I feel like if he had a little bit of it without you, that's pushing it but probably acceptable. To kill the whole bottle though? Wild", "NTA. But I find your BF's lack of understanding and respect for the basics of Mine/Yours/Ours quite a big red flag.", "NTA. Your boyfriend certainly is though! It was a gift for you, and was expensive. If he wanted some, he should have had the courtesy to ask.", "NTA- He owes you an expensive bottle of whiskey. I don\u2019t drink my partner\u2019s alcohol without asking. Neither does he. That\u2019s not the same as groceries.", "NTA, just because it\u2019s in the house doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s fair game for both of you. By this argument, whenever he brings leftovers home from a restaurant you\u2019re entitled to them since the food in the house is for everyone. That was a gift to YOU for your hard work and you didn\u2019t get to enjoy any of it thanks to his selfishness.", "NTA.  As it was a gift for you, it should have been off limits until you have some.", "NTA but your boyfriend is a selfish dink. \n\nDo you know how many times I \u201cfinished\u201d something (like anything; bread, chips, cake, beer) without at least asking if other people in my household wanted to get in on it?\n\nFully zero times.", "NTA I enjoy whiskey, my husband isn\u2019t a big whiskey drinker. He has a cupboard of expensive whiskey that he has gotten from work and as various gifts. I would absolutely appreciate drinking them more than he would. But they were his gifts so I leave them be. I guess his plan is to go on a month bender when he retires.", "NTA\n\nAdmittedly I'm biased as I had an ex chug an expensive bottle of scotch the day I bought it that would have lasted me a month... so I have some baggage here. But if he knew it was your thing he absolutely shouldn't have finished it, even if offered, and it sounds like he just assumed here so...  \n\n\nNext time lock it down or establish some ground rules for it I guess.", "NTA\n\nThe whiskey was a essentially a gift, but FOR YOU. Your bf should\u2019ve asked to have some or at the very least left some for you. My thought process would\u2019ve been, \u201cMaybe OP would like to try some!\u201d It\u2019s inconsiderate of him to drink all of the bottle.", "NTA right at the 'well you should have drank it sooner'.", "NTA. He needs to replace it with something equal or better.", "NTA it wasn't a joint grocery purchase. It was a gift given to YOU as a reward for YOUR hard work. It was YOURS. He had no right to drink it all without asking.", "The fact that your boyfriend doesn't recognize this as an award you received, even tho it was engraved and personalized, makes him a giant asshole.  \n\nDoes he think other gifts you received that he likes is up for the taking too? To me this reeks if disrespect for your professional accomplishments.", "Nta", "NTA, I would dump him immediately. And leave your good booze in the box and hide it when guests come over!", "NTA. He's acting like he used all the bread or milk or something, when really it's more like he ate your entire birthday cake without saving you any. \n\nThe bigger problem is that he would turn it on you and blame you for not drinking it fast enough. It would be one thing if he was like oh I didn't realize you wanted it since it was there so long I'm genuinely sorry, but the fact that he tri d pulling the reverse card ain't good.", "NTA.  That was a very personal gift.  Go put on all of his underwear, and tell him it's fine because it was just lying there and available.  That's how ridiculous he sounds", "he's a a major a*hole. He either thinks your stupid or a pushover and don't merit any consideration.  would he feel the same way if situation was reversed? I'm annoyed for you. Very selfish and inconsiderate, no mention of an apology.", "Nta. \n\nBut hmmmm....what else is in the house that can be replenished? His money? His phone? His clothes?", ">He said we have food and drinks in our house which are for both of us and we both drink them and I could replace it if I wanted to, as per other joint grocery purchases.\n\nx.x except this **was not** a joint purchase!\n\nNTA wtf is wrong with him", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would say none here, except for the crack that you should have drunk it more quickly yourself.\n\nNTA. He stole a gift and tried to gaslight you. Pay for a bottle that is twice as expensive from the household funds. \n\nI'm sure it would never occur to you to not so gradually transfer it to a carafe and hide that in your closet, leaving the bottle with a few miserable dregs in the liquor cabinet.", "Oooh this feels gaslight-y.

He knows better but is trying to make you doubt yourself.", "NTA-  this was not \u201cgroceries,\u201d it was a gift.  \n\nIf he was given a gift certificate for a restaurant and you went out to eat without him and used it up, would that be ok? \n\nHe was very inconsiderate.  It\u2019s also concerning that he powered through an entire bottle of nice whiskey in less than a few weeks.  Does he have self control issues around alcohol?", "NTA. As a fellow whiskey drinker who doesn't drink that often, I'd be livid. He'd be buying me a new bottle, and it had better be bigger than the last one. \n\nThat wasn't community property like a gallon of milk. It was a special gift given to you, and you only. That it's whiskey doesn't matter, it was your gift and he used (drank) it all for himself.", "INFO do you both usually share whiskey or alcohol thats brought home?

I'm told I should have eaten something sooner and whatever it is, could be sitting in the fridge for like a day. Geez. I agree with you. I totally misunderstood and OP explained.

Okay, I'm sorry. I got it wrong. Go together and replace it. I'm sorry he drank the whole thing. When you get a new bottle (and you should) take the time and just really enjoy it. You deserve it for a job well done.", "That\u2019s selfishness with extra steps. NTA", "I've lived with roommates like that before. You're NTA for expecting your special treat to remain, however, not everyone thinks that way. Time for some extra communication. I feel the same way you do and have had to explain it to people before. If your BF pushes back and thinks your expectation is unacceptable, *then* I would definitely start reconsidering your compatibility. Because ultimately it's about respect (respecting your wishes). However, if this hasn't come up and been early communicated before, you're within reason to be upset but equally he is not necessarily in the wrong for having finished the whisky. While it seems like common decency to most people, it isn't universal.", "Even without that, still rude.", "Fair enough, I don't agree with others saying that you should dump him, but I do also think you could let him know ahead of time if there's something you want to save in addition to whatever discussions you've already had.
