And I certainly would not drink the *entire* bottle of any of them in a few weeks! Fancy bottles are for special occasions, not finishing quickly! OP\u2019s bf definitely knew what he was doing here. He knew she wasn\u2019t going to drink it for a while and drank it all \ud83d\ude44 and to say it\u2019s like their groceries!!! SMH everyone knows that a fancy bottle of alcohol received as an award/gift are not like the shared groceries in the refrigerator. What an AH. NTA", "I have had to deal with this exact scenario recently. It feels absolutely awful to tell someone a shitty house guest ate their present out of spite. \n\nWhich is exactly what the culprit told me. That they ate my gift and anything else in the kitchen they thought would upset me, purely out of spite.", "My husband does this.  It infuriates me to no end! It doesn't matter if the drink or whatever it is suits there for a day, a week, or even a year, it's NOT yours! \nI personally don't drink that much so sometimes I but a cheap bottle of Moscato has a few drinks and intend to drink the rest the next day or two and don't get around to it.  When I do, I'll find it's gone.  This goes a huge step beyond. Their NAME was on it and it was a gift for a damn good job.  Don't touch it unless explicitly asked if you'd like to try. Even then, only take what is offered and no more!", "This is me too. I'm not really a whisky drinker but husband loves it so I take pride in learning about it and snapping up good bottles when I find them (once got the Ardbeg perpetuum for around $200 which made me and hubby very happy). Despite buying it would never drink it without asking.", "Exactly - alcohol etiquette - don't take it unless it's offered.", "Ours was a private war just between the two of us.  Peace broke out when we decided to buy two cartons of ice-cream instead of splitting one.", "Because OP is an enabler."]}
