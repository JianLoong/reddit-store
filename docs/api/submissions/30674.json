Let her choose what she prefer: the extra 200 while she will pay for everything else she needs/wants, or stay exacly how it is. You can also say to your sister that she is free to help with your mother expenses. \n\nMaybe she doesnt completly sees how much you are paying so you should show it to her (them). \n\nThis is why I would never buy a house in the conditions you did.

Ask those who do nothing how you are \"taking advantage\".", "INFO: I'm confused. Your mom is living with you & husband, y'all are paying all the expenses and she wants you to pay her $200 per month? Is that correct? What exactly is that $200 a month for?", "I have a couple of questions.  Firstly, who is listed on the deed and on the mortgage.  If you are on either and are paying all the mortgage and all the utilities and food for your mom, then it seems that its actually you guys being taken advantage of.  When you say 300K loan, what does that exactly mean.  Did she loan you guys that money to buy the house?  It looks like you used the proceeds from the original house towards this one.  Who legally owned the original house?", "Soft YTA if I\u2019ve understand this correctly.  You tied up the money your mother had in her home to buy your new place with the agreement that that would give her $200 as payment knowing the size of mortgage and you would cover living costs, now you have some unexpected costs you have gone back on the agreement. Your mother was planing $800 a month for her leisure and now you are judging her use of her disposable income.  Soft as it sounds like you're given a lot to support her but it\u2019s a mess , I wouldn\u2019t spreadsheet it for your Aunt but I would spreadsheet it for you and your mum.  Calculate how much you would have to pay on a loan for the money she has in the house. It may make you feel better about $200.  You think your mum is better off but she could have \u201clost\u201d the house and have her equity in a small apartment just for her and possibly income from deposits to live off. Would have been good to lay out all of the contributions, yes your mother has give a large contribution and still is with equity, before it got to this with a professional neutral financial advisor, I feel for you all.", "You are paying all of the household expenses and now have to pay for repairs on top of everything else? \n\nSeems to me there's a big miscommunication here. You probably should have discussed cessation of the $200 payments due to repair work needed *before* you just stopped paying it.\n\nHowever, your mom isn't taking into account all that you both have paid and still pay. All the work you put into both properties.\n\nThis is just a misunderstanding that can be cleared up with a discussion explaining the numbers and a request to stop the $200 payments for a set period of time.\n\nNAH.", "NAH. I suspect there needs to be a lot more documentation, probably in 14 pt font, and transparency about the financial arrangements between you and your mother.  Even though your mother is living with zero expenses as you say, you agreed to give her an additional $200 allowance and you are not doing that.  Also, however you phrase it, your mother either loaned or gave you the money from the sale of *her* house (that you put improvements into) toward the purchase of *your* house. I can see why she feels a bit taken advantage of.", "NTA", "NTA- if you are paying into the mortgage too, then you dont owe her anything extra. So all she is paying is part of the mortgage and nothing else? WOW, not her thats getting taken for in this situation.", "NAH\n\nShe may not realize how much you spent etc on the other house. She prob views all the inconvenience as not a big deal either. \n\nI would add up what you spent and say you want to really clear up - does she really want you to pay for whatever now -- and if so, is she prepared to reimburse you for previous costs - or does she want to keep it as \"even\"", "YTA\n\nIf you used her house to provide your downpayment then, yes, you owe her that money back.  The mortgage you are paying is being paid on a house that you own.  It is your money being paid for your mortgage on a house you would not own without the help of your mother.  \n\nI don't know how much money you put into the place with your mother's money - but that money is money that you would have been paying interest on, whereas now you're not.  \n\nStop being an asshole and pay your mother back her money.", "This is all really depends.  Such as how much money your mother put into your current home compared to you.  Also is your mom willing to sell her portion of the home to you when you're done paying her off.", "YTA.  You made an agreement to give her money.  It was a bad agreement, but an agreement just the same.  You see it as her house too, but her name is not on the mortgage I am betting so it isn't her house and she gets nothing out of it financially when she pays for improvements.  You got something out of the improvements you made on the last house in the form of increased money from the sale and money towards this house.  I see your view, the problem is you made an agreement and are not keeping up with it.  The \"she \"loaned\" us to buy this new house (its her house too, so i don't see it as a loan)\" makes you another A.  A loan is a loan.  You are supposed to pay back loans.  People with that attitude who get a loan and then decide not to pay it back is why so many refuse to loan family money.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I guarantee it.  300K is a lot of money.  She could have sold that house, but she did not.
