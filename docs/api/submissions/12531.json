We validated each others feelings and really went over what that month WILL look like because we are not passing up this opportunity. \n\nWe have scheduled/designated \"safe people\" and places for if and when I feel overwhelmed. He promised to check in as often as I felt necessary. We looked at our budget since his pay will temporarily decrease because he's training and not working, yay technicalities, and made a good grocery plan. He also asked how he could better support me in breastfeeding.\n\nI promised not to blow up his phone but also be transparent if I needed something.  In the coming week he will walk me through minor maintenance things in the home to help limit wasting time on that stuff and focus more on us and the kids over the phone.\n\nThank you all for the honest opinions. It is sometimes so hard to see past your own emotions and fears when they are fresh.\n\n\n\nPreface: I AM very happy and proud of his promotion. He has been in his profession for 20 years,  literally since he was a teen. He recently met someone higher up and wants my husband to do the work he does.

I never said he shouldn't do it but I did ask if it could wait even 6 months.

Yay.\n\nNow to the practical part of what are you and your newborn going to do while he is off for a month being trained? Do you have family or friends that you can lean on?\n\nI bet they put him in a business travelers residential accommodation. These places have kitchens and a living room as well as a bed. Even better, they are so much more than a \u201cshell of a house\u201d. I think you should go with him.

Congrats, btw, on the baby and house!\n\nTry looking at this from his POV: he gets a great opportunity and you start talking logistics? Did you congratulate him before pointing out all the bad stuff? I would be pretty bummed if I got a promotion and my partner immediately went launched into how inconvenient it was. \n\nThat being said, I can totally understand where you\u2019re coming from, I would be panicked enough with a four week old baby, nevermind a half built house, nevermind my husband coming home and telling me he\u2019s leaving for a month!\n\nNeither of you are AHs, you\u2019re just two people under a lot of stress at the moment, and you need to find the time to sit down and have an honest conversation. Start with an apology for not being excited, let him know you are excited, but ask him to look at it from your POV. Being saddled alone with a newborn for a month sucks. If he can delay, great, if not, hopefully you have other family around you who can step up and help you out so your husband can put your family in a better position.", "NAH.  I think it\u2019s reasonable that you are upset about the timing.  Lot of responsibility will fall on you in the next month when he is away and you are rightfully cautious of it.  But at the same time his promotion is something that will move you guys up in the world, and in the long run will help your husband and you tremendously.  I think you should ask him to maybe bring in external support or something to help you in the next month or so if you don\u2019t think you can do it yourself, either family member or a nanny type deal.", "NAH. But be realistic. He applied for the promotion but now he can't go to the training for six months.  No employer will put up with that. They'll give the promotion to someone else and I doubt they would give him another chance.", "YTA- typically if it was not trades work I would say this was bad planning but he\u2019s in trades. This something that people dream about and does not happen. You yourself noted that this will be less back breaking work.\n\nStart working out a plan with your family and his family to have someone with you for the month. One month of inconvenience is a financial security and a live/health husband. You know this work takes years off his life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The family and the house should be the top priority.", "NTA for wanting to communicate about it and expressing your concerns and feelings.\n\nIt is a big ask to ask an employer to wait around for you for 6 months. I see why it's not necessarily an option.\n\nDo you have family or friends who could help you out for the month he is gone?", "Yta. Try to support your man.", "NTA really. I'm not sure what is up with your husband's defensiveness. But sometimes opportunities really are now or never unfortunately. And it sounds like a good one. A month isn't super long (though I know, with a new baby, it could feel that way!) - unless you're living in the shell of an unfinished home with a new baby. Which I really hope you are not.", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re not happy for him or even like you don\u2019t want him to go, just that you recognize that the timing is not ideal and were hoping there was another way. Which is very understandable, given that you are caring for a newborn. He should hear your concerns and help come up with solutions, rather than accuse you of not wanting him to be successful.", "NTA, this was a communication issue between you but mostly it seem he read into your question and associated a totally different motivation behind it, which is unfair to you. You can be happy and thrilled for him and have questions about the practical impacts. I hope he cools off and realizes it is perfectly reasonable for there to be questions about how this will work and that you should work together creatively to make it manageable. Doing so does not in any way dampen the importance or excitement of the opportunity.", "NAH\n\nIt sounds as if your husband really can't afford to give up this opportunity.  It's natural for him to want you to be happy about the situation, and have your support.\n\nAt the same time, it's reasonable for your feelings to be very mixed.  Happy he has a great opportunity, but at the same time panicked because the timing is really bad.  \n\nFour weeks out from having given birth, you're probably not going to be back at 100% yet. The baby won't be sleeping through the night.  And, in many places, particularly the US, there isn't paid maternity leave, so you will be struggling to care for a newborn while also trying to keep up with your job.\n\nCongratulate him, but also talk to him about planning for you to have some support during his absence.  \n\nDo you have a trusted family member who can stay with you, and help with childcare and the house?  Can you afford a cleaning service once or twice a week?  Can you arrange a way to make things like meal planning easier, such as budgeting for more delivery, or a meal kit service (e.g., Hello Fresh)?  Can you arrange automatic delivery of things like diapers on a schedule, so you don't have to deal with shopping and dragging bulky packages home while trying to also carry an infant?  Are there support groups for new mothers in your area, perhaps through the public library or a town recreation center?  \n\nYour concerns are real.  But they may be solvable problems.", "I'm going to go against the grain and say YTA, it's not that long and it's for your future.", "YTA \n\nYou care so much about your child yet you want him to pass up a job opportunity that will mean:\n\nmore money (better education for child! \nEasier on the body (your husband can still play with your kid) \nMore consistent hours (he can see his kid, you guys can have routine, better for childcare etc? \n\n\nthink of the long term benefits of this promotion.

You should be able to voice your concerns to your husband without him reacting this way.", "Softly and unintentionally TA because instead of just saying congratulations and being happy about it, you immediately brought up how inconvenient it would be for you if he went away now. I think if you'd brought it up at a later time, it would probably not have caused an argument.

And the fact that he'll be leaving you in a not finished house.\n\nPossible comprise: Can you take some time off of your work? If so, then Lock up the house and you move there with him. Even if he's at training all day at least you'll see him in the evening and he'll see his baby and you.\n\nIf not, then he needs to come up with other support options for you while he's gone. And he should video call everyday. I mean if I had a newborn I sure wouldn't want to miss him/her growing up. At least he can see him/her that way.", "NAH\n\nBoth of you are trying to build a family, it's reasonable to want him home, but it's reasonable for him to take the job also. That job has better hours? Better pto? That means the job will pay you back later.\n\nSee if you can find a relative to help you when he's gone", "NTA. It's certainly understandable that, with a four-week-old baby at home, you should ask whether the training could be delayed. \n\nSince it was only a question, and you didn't argue or whinge on about it, I actually find it a little suspicious that he's deflecting like he is.", "NAH\n\nYou need to realize that wanting to provide his family and newborn child is probably the things he wants more than anything. \n\nWhat you are focusing on is the temporary aspect, which yes, may be difficult, but he is focused on the long term and is just NOT going to risk that something happens that somehow makes the opportunity either not available or not available SOON. \n\nYou are not wrong for not liking the timing but I think you need to acknowledge that long term, this is going to be good for all of you and mainly, it is not work risking.", "NAH\n\nSounds like the timing really is poor.  But sometimes we have to jump when we can.  This may be one of those times.", "NTA. I expected something different from the title.  Asking your husband if he can wait for a few months was reasonable. It did not seem you told him to pass on it.  I would be surprised if no one at the company finds it odd that he spent 4 weeks away from the newborn.  Please have him step-up and figure out support for you.  At the very least he should ensure that you have grocery help, cleaning help and someone to give you breaks.  This will be tough, but hopefully it will lead to a strong and more balanced life. Congrats on the baby!", "So, he's going to be gone for a month while you have a newborn and a construction zone? Yeah, I wouldn't be over the moon either. Needs sometimes must, but that doesn't mean we're always excited about it. NTA.\n\nIf you have family that you can visit for a month, I'd do that. You aren't going to be sleeping well, depending on how labor goes you could still have some restrictions on what you can do (C-sections can take up to 6 weeks before you're off restrictions), and you're just going to be getting back to your regularly scheduled hormones. Find someone else to be your support person who makes sure laundry gets done when you just can't, and figure out who can support you around managing the house building.", "NTA him being gone for such a long chunk of time affects the logistics of the family. Granted, before you started asking questions you could\u2019ve been a little more congratulatory,.  It\u2019s a bit decision\n I hope you both find a solution that works best for all of you", "YTA Yes it\u2019s bad timing but these opportunities do not come up often. You can work decades at the same job and never get an opportunity for a meaningful promotion. Of course if sucks that it\u2019s right after a baby and while building a house but no one is going to let you delay the promotion for six months. That makes it look like he wouldn\u2019t be able to handle a promotion.\n\nWhen it comes down to it - the company has a job that needs to be filled. If he can\u2019t do it, they will find someone else. This is just the reality of jobs.\n\nYou may want to consider if you have family to help out so he can do this. Also, if you\u2019re struggling this much with the changes already happening that you aren\u2019t excited about all of the benefits this job could bring without worrying this much, maybe talk to someone.  It\u2019s okay to feel overwhelmed and ask for help.", "NTA, your concerns are valid. I would urge the both of you to reasonably discuss how your husband can go (that should be the starting point I think), but you're supported too. Maybe a family member can come to help you, or he can hire someone. That way he can do what he wants (and is also beneficial for the family longer term) and you get support.", "NTA My husband left for a fantastic work opportunity abroad just when I had a baby. He had to take it because his pay wasn't great and it would enable us to have a much better lifestyle, to go from struggling to managing. But the house was set up for the baby and I had his very loving, supportive parents within walking distance. I had a neighbour next door with a baby and a best friend with twins the same age as my baby a street away. The supermarket and pharmacy and doctor's surgery was a short walk as well as a park and mums and toddler's group. I was trained in childcare, so I knew how tough it was going to be, but I was not very well and knackered all of the time. I got through it because I knew how much it meant for the life we could give children and because it wasn't forever. Also, because I had a support system. I wouldn't do it if I was left with a baby and stuck to get to and from infrastructure, with less than ideal homeset up and no support from other people.", "NTA. Your husband's opportunity is great. But he's got responsibilities for more than his job. And given your family's situation, he can't responsibly accept that opportunity until he's worked WITH his wife and support network to ensure that his wife and newborn are not left in the lurch.", "INFO: How long do you have between him telling you and him leaving? It seems like max 3.5 weeks. \n\nI mean that\u2019s not a lot of time if you don\u2019t have a built in network plus you\u2019re literally trying to survive this our at each point. It\u2019s not that you weren\u2019t excited. Your brain is in survival mode. I don\u2019t blame you.\n\nHis reaction was an over reaction IMO. I get he\u2019s hurt, and I hope he can apologize. You already admitted you don\u2019t think you told him you\u2019re happy  for him. You could do that now, but there\u2019s no fault in your reaction at all.", "A NAH\n\nFrom your comments, you didn\u2019t congratulate him. You instantly went into panic mode. He was excited to tell you this news, and it immediately turned into a negative from your side. He\u2019s worked towards this for 20 years. \n\nYou both want it, it just happened at an inconvenient time. It\u2019s not something he can afford to pass up. \nI\nt would have been best to celebrate with him, give it little bit, and then start talking logistics once the excitement wore off a little. You threw water on his candle.", "NAH.\n\nYou have every right to be uncomfortable with him being away from the newborn for a month, that's completely reasonable.\n\nHe also has every right to take this opportunity that he's waited 20 years for in order to be able to provide more for the family. \n\nBoth of you are completely valid in how you feel, but ultimately I think the right move is for your husband to go through with the training. Based on the first paragraph where you list the benefits such as less strain on the body, consistent hours, PTO, and great pay - this is just me speaking plainly, but a month of difficulty to set up a potential lifelong career that will allow your husband to be a more present father going forward seems like the right move for everyone.\n\nMaybe I'm off base, but I look at this the same way as getting a tattoo; temporary pain in exchange for a desired end result.", "If your baby was going to be 4 months old, then I could maybe understand, but 4 weeks? JFC. NTA.", "NTA, I would panic in your situation too, people may not understand how hard life is for you right now if they haven't gone through it.  I totally get it.  And like you I would ultimately want my husband to go it sounds like a great opportunity for his future and ultimately for the family but in the short term it will have a huge negative impact on you.  I would just try to mend fences and tell him you are excited for him but being left alone with a baby and no real home made you panic.  Can you stay with parents or a sibling or a friend for part or all of the time for some help and company?  Good luck.", "(Thank you) This is fair. I don't think I did congratulate him. I may have instantly gone into panic mode thinking who will help me? How will this affect our connection? He's also my main socialization right now. I am very happy and excited he gets to travel, something he never does, but mom brain kicked on and panic set in. \nWe do have people that can help IF their available. We often time have to plan get together months in advance because of convenience.  Then it gets in my head that I'm bothering them.", "Why should she apologize for bringing up very valid points? I agree with NAH, but it\u2019s on the husband to accommodate her with whatever she needs if he\u2019s going to bounce for a month 4 weeks after his baby is born.", "This. Plus not only could it feel to him like you're not excited, it's likely that he's worried about the same things you are and feels guilty and torn. Be excited and supportive but also have frank conversations about logistics and feelings, not only your own but his as well.", "I was thinking this too.

I'm so proud of you and the work you've put in for years to get to this place.  It is huge for you and our family!\" and then go into the reasons you list here for panicking.

All those rules go out the window because caring for a baby by yourself for a month is meltdown-anxiety inducing level of hard and *of course* that\u2019s the first thing on your mind because you\u2019re not taking care of a baby 24/7. No one does a job 24/7 without breaks for a freaking month and that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking at.\n\nYour husband could also have said \u201chey I know this will be really hard for you, are you okay if I go or should I try to delay it?\u201d It doesn\u2019t sound like he did so no, this is absolutely not all on you. As the one who hasn\u2019t given birth, doesn\u2019t have the postpartum hormones and the postpartum recovery, right now it\u2019s on him to think through what impact it will have on you and address that. Now in a few weeks after you\u2019ve recovered and both adjusted then it can be a little more equal again but hell no, now is not the time to spring that on you and expect you to be okay with it.\n\nAny other circumstances and I\u2019d probably say Y T A but considering where you\u2019re at right now it\u2019s a hard NTA.", "Then tell him this, that you went into panic mode, and you are sorry and proud for him. But also tell that the panic is valid; men may think that women somehow magically and instantly know how to care for babies etc. And they don't understand that it is like recovering from a major surgery while keeping a vulnerable baby alive 25/7.  He wouldn't leave you alone after major surgery, would he. Maybe he can take you with him, or maybe you can go stay with your parents etc.\nYou are in this together, let him and you plan together how you survive this. NAH.", "I understand.  I tend to just blurt out EVERYTHING I\u2019m thinking/feeling when I get home.  My poor husband can\u2019t always handle it.  I try not to.  I agree with the posts that say communicating is key!", "Because she admitted to not even congratulating him on working hard and getting the promotion, just jumped straight to panic mode.", "Yeah it would've been nice if she started with \"congratulations\" but... I can't imagine being postpartum, healing from childbirth, dealing with PPD, and finding out you have to solo parent your 4-week-old for an entire month. \n\nI think NAH, but both could've handled it differently. She could've thrown in a \"congratulations\" and he could've been more sensitive to her needs when telling her the news. It's like he didn't even think about the fact that he's asking his postpartum wife to care for a baby without help for a month and taking for granted that it would be just fine and dandy.", "Can you stay with friends or family?", "ESH. There is like zero predictability in a baby that age. My husband worked out of town for a week when our son was 5 weeks old and I didn\u2019t shower for 5 days in the middle. Also couldn\u2019t drive after my C-section, so it was just fun all around. Definitely apologize for your zoom into panic mode, but he for real needs to see that 1 month solo with an infant is going to be so rough on you", "Soft YTA, the timing isn't great but this is a temporary situation that will provide a huge return in the future.  The house will get built, maybe a little behind schedule but it will happen.   Don't panic.  The baby will likely be fine, as will you. You are likely stronger than you think you are and can get through this.  It will be exhausting for you but you can do this. This is the time to pull in your support people.\n\nMy spouse and I are both military, there have been multiple times over the years that one of us has been deployed or away for weeks of training with our children from early infancy through teenage years. It's tough on the parent left at home but everyone got through it. Actually, the teenagers were more difficult than when they were babies.", "YTA.", "YTA. Intentionally or not. It\u2019s a huge achievement for him, and benefits your family; the first words out of your mouth should have been congratulations. Not immediately jumping on to negative and putting up roadblocks.", "NAH\n\nI'm assuming this is your first child? \n\nBecause the timing is PERFECT. \n\nYou do NOT want to be left alone in the first few weeks because of the recovery of childbirth. \n\nYou do NOT want to be left alone at 6 months, because that's when they stop being little potatoes and start moving, and becoming a lot more trouble. \n\n4 - 8 weeks? They more or less just sleep. Will it be easy for you? No. But in terms of timing, that's the easiest part it'll be. \n\nI can't comment on your house situation, just the baby. \n\nThis is a 1 time training thing, and if I offered someone a promotion and they said: \"Now's not through right time, how about in 6 months time\" - I'd assume it's not something they really want.", "My husband was doing really important training that was scheduled for the week I was going to be induced. It was set for a Saturday so we were happy he was going to be there for the whole thing. I ended up having to be induced on Thursday due to my high blood pressure (I'm diabetic type 1) they started at about 3pm and man, there's a bunch of stuff that didn't go how I wanted it to, but its not important in this sense. He didn't get to the hospital until 730pm and I ended up giving birth at 8:25pm. He stayed with me until about 3am(studying the entire time) then left to go back home so he could take his test Friday morning. I was extremely disappointed. But, his work is making our lives SO much better. His work then gave him two weeks for paternity leave. I should mention the test he took Friday was just to get a voucher to take the actual test. So the two weeks of paternity leave he had was all spent studying and I didn't get much help from him then either. (We also have a 4 year old) \n\nBut guess what? It was all to better our lives. I know it's hard, TRUST ME, but if he has to go, he has to go. There's no way around it. He's doing it to better your lives. I think he might be being a little dramatic saying you're not happy for him. Calmly explain to him why your sad about him having to leave, not that you don't want him to. \n\nI also asked if it could be rescheduled for my husband but it couldn't, it was just something I had to accept and unfortunately that's what it seems for you too. It's only a month, just take lots of pictures and videos for him. 1 to 2 months the baby won't change drastically. Not like 1 month to 6.\n\nEdit: I should've probably added that I don't work, so I take care of our children. They aren't in daycare or anything", "There is no AH in this situation. Really **really** crap timing for both of you.", "NTA. 1. Congratulate him on the promotion. It's a wonderful opportunity, and you know that he's worked hard for 20 years to get here. 2. You're sorry if you didn't sound excited, but you started panicking about being alone with a new baby for a month and feeling like a burden to your friends/family that live near you. Is there someone who can stay with you while he's gone? Or a few people that can stay a week at a time? Can you go with him? \n\nThere's a solution as long as you guys come together to figure it out so that he can get his training and you can have support.", "Another poster suggested going with him. Is that an option? NTA.", "Sadly no. It's would be out of pocket expenditures that we don't have plus our other kids are in school.", "A lot of these comments are absolutely fucking ridiculous. No, you aren't TA, and he absolutely is for how he immediately jumped to rude accusations in response to you asking a simple question. Yes this is a great opportunity that he should take up, but you aren't wrong to be wary about this when you won't even be fully healed from giving birth when he leaves you to be a single parent for an entire month during a time when you may struggle with PPD on top of the other struggles of being a parent to a newborn baby. I'm so sorry there are people actually telling you that you were wrong to ask a simple question and telling you that he was right to go off on you for asking.\n\nI'm glad to see that you and your husband were able to talk things over and come up with a plan to make things easier on you.", "Grown-ups working it out. Love it.", "YTA, this is something that is truly rare and you're going to have to find a way to cope while he's at training.", "But how will the bills get paid if his work isn't also a top priority?", "Maybe this situation can inspire you to work on building your relationships with friends and family. It's a lot to expect your husband to be 100% of your support system.", "Your update makes me happy. Congrats for being a team and working through this. I am a stranger but i am proud of you two. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNAH", "NTA. You may not have thought to immediately congratulate him,  but HE didn't for one moment even stop to consider the logistics of literally just having had a baby in his rush to be excited for himself. Wtf. It's like you and the baby didn't even exist.", "My husband was hired by a major airline and had training 2000 miles from home. After training and probation, he was based 4000 miles from home.  He left when our 3rd was 2 months old, but the other two were 5 and 7. I also ran a family home-based daycare for 6 boys, ages 3-7. The kids and I moved closer to his base after 6 months. Couldn't have gotten through it without my weekly H\u00e4agen-Dazs and Star Trek:NG with my BIL!", "Please he didn\u2019t just push a whole human being out of himself \ud83d\ude44", "No. He never even stopped to consider the logistics involved in this, he just dumped it on her and expected congratulations. He could have started with \"here is my new opportunity and here is my plan to make it happen, what do you think? \" instead of just silently dumping all the hard part onto her.", "She just had a baby, her body is flooded with chemicals and hormones and her instincts are yelling at her to protect her family unit - husband/protector leaving would freak most women out on a purely instinctual level.", "I swear, unless the woman ate someone else\u2019s food, pregnant women can just about do no wrong in this sub.", "NTA. He should have consulted with you first and worked out at least some element if the logistics. \n\nWould you expect him to be overjoyed if you told him you were taking a month away from home without discussing it first, or expect him worry about the logistics of leaving him alone with a newborn first?\n\nEdit: you may not be cleared to drive after major surgery by 4 weeks, or could go late and have a 3 week old. \n\nWho has he called to arrange to support you and the newborn while he\u2019s gone? Or is he just throwing this on your lap?", "So she can just not care for the infant for a month because \u2018it\u2019s not that long\u2019 ?", "Yeah I bet he wouldn\u2019t congratulate her if she announced she\u2019d be dropping a newborn on him solo for 4 weeks - even if it helped their family in the long run.", "Bummer. Well, make sure husband knows he cannot go unless he arranges enough support for you to be solo for a month.  I have been a single parent a long time then remarried and had more kids. My partner took a job that was travel one third of the time in blocks of usually 10 days. I had lots of 10 day stretches alone with twins that were 2 until summer of covid (about two years). Getting 3 kids to school and daycare and managing my full time job and my part time job was very tiring but with some help from friends and my mom visiting sometimes we made it work. I am very glad that is over.\n\nMy partner was very understanding of the burden they added and would treat me nicely . It was a great opportunity for them and all in all was worth it.  I hope it turns out as well for you."]}
