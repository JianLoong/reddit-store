{"id": 32112, "submission_id": "188ec6l", "title": "AITA for painting a curse word on the wall of my friend's new house?", "selftext": "My friend and his wife just bought their first home. It is a fixer upper and I have been helping them out with the fixing. \n\nMy father was a handyman and contractor so I have a lot of skills and experience with doing maintenance, repairs, and upgrades on a house. I also have pretty much all the tools I need to do most of the work. \n\nThis last weekend I was helping paint the dining room. I had everything set up the way I wanted and I was ready to go. For some fucking reason his wife decides to let their dogs into the room I'm painting. \n\nOne of them steps in the roller tray and then jumps up on me. His wife laughed it off like it was not a big deal that I had paw prints on me. I also had to throw out that primer because  it now had mud in it. I had told them both to let me do the work in peace. \n\nAfter I prepared a new tray of paint I wrote the word \"FUCK\" in huge letters on the wall. IN PRIMER. \n\nFor those of you who may not know primer is the coat of paint that you put down before the actual paint. For lack of a better word it sticks to the wall better and when it dries it creates a better surface for the paint to stick to. \n\nHis wife saw it and freaked. She said I was drawing profanity in her house. I told her it was primer and to stay out of my way. \n\nI then finished the job and went home. My friend called me and said that I had really upset his wife with my childishness and that she would not let me back until I apologized. I asked him what I was apologizing for. He said that I wrote a curse word on his wall. I asked him to provide a picture. He said he couldn't since I had painted over it. I asked what the problem was since the word wasn't there any more. He said that I needed to apologize. I said that him wanting me to apologize was in no way the same as me needing to apologize. He said that I could not come back until I did. No problem for me. I was helping him for free on my weeks off from work. \n\nHe called me two days later and asked if I was coming to finish painting since I would be away at work for three weeks. I said I wasn't ready to apologize yet and maybe I would when I got back. I probably won't. \n\nNow she is telling everyone that I'm a shitty person for leaving a job half finished. I tell everyone who asks that I was working for free and that they told me not to come back. \n\nNow there is a big fight in our friend group between the people who think I should keep the peace and those who think she is being an entitled whiner. No one else is volunteering to help at their house and now either they have to half ass the job or pay someone. I'm getting hell for that too. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701443779, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/188ec6l/aita_for_painting_a_curse_word_on_the_wall_of_my/", "score": 6908, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re doing hundreds if not thousands of dollars of work for free. There seems to be no appreciation for that.\n2. They let the dogs in the room to make your job harder. They are lucky the dogs walking into the paint tray didn\u2019t create a bigger and permanent mess.\n3. There is literally no lasting consequence to your actions. The word probably stayed on the wall less than 5 minutes. \n\nThe reason you wrote that on the wall was because you\u2019re being taken advantage of in this friendship.", "nta. did they even offer to pay you for the job to begin with? if not they aren\u2019t entitled to your time. besides the word is covered so it shouldn\u2019t be a big deal they wouldn\u2019t have even seen it if they didn\u2019t walk in before u painted over it\n\nedit: thanks for all the upvotes i\u2019ve never had more than 200 lol. don\u2019t forget to drink some water and eat some food today!", "OMFG, if they want you to come back and paint their stupid fixer upper-for *free* then they can suck it up and be *grateful*.

Ohh what a scary threat. You can't come back and work for free on your days off unless you apologize.", "NTA.\n\nHalf the point of helping to paint a friend's house is to paint naughty words or images for a cheap laugh and then painting over them. It's right there on the first page of the by-laws, everyone knows that. \n\nGiven the ridiculous over reaction here, I'd just dump the friend (still be civil in group settings, but don't deal with any of his sh\\*t or do any favors for him).", "> people who think I should keep the peace\n\n\"If keeping the peace is so important to you, you're welcome to go paint their house or pay a professional.\"\n\nNTA", "NTA. Not sure why your friend and wife couldn't foresee their insisting on getting an apology backfiring. You're working for FREE on YOUR downtime.\nIf I were you I'd demand an apology in return for letting the dogs in the room, but also wouldn't blame you for never apologizing.", "NTA... a bit. Frustrated because of her stupid dog you wrote it on the wall. Then painted over. But she's got her knickers in a twist. I sort of get it, from her, but she should get a grip, work is being done for free, there's no harm done, nothing to see. Get over it. And keep your stupid dogs out. Has she apologised for that? \n\nJust go LC for a bit. They can paint their own flipping walls, or pay someone. Guess what, contractors sometimes swear... Telling you \"You can't come back and work your weekends for free\" well gosh, can't I. Guess I'll have to watch tv then.", "I think this belongs in r/choosingbeggars \nNta if everyone is so pressed about it they could go paint on their off time. Also every time my husband paints he draws a wiener in primer. We laugh and he covers it up.", "So you are voluntarily helping your friends fix their house? This isn't a job - this is you helping out a friend in your spare time?\n\nFirst, the wife is obviously at fault for the original problem. Letting dogs loose in a room that was being painted is completely ridiculous.\n\nGetting upset about you painting an obscenity on the wall? It was in primer, and you painted over the whole wall in primer, and then the top coat goes on - it's unlikely that your obscenity would show up even as a small color change in strong light or something (why, yes - I've written something on my walls in paint, in an undercoat, and then I've seen it again a year later when the lighting was just right. Fortunately, it wasn't obscene!)\n\nI do know some people who would get very upset about bad juju or something from having obscenity embedded in their walls like this. I don't know whether that's what's motivating the wife here or not, but presumably she can burn sweetgrass, or hang up magic crystals, or do whatever else she thinks will \"cleanse\" the room.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA.

You vented your reasonable frustration in a totally harmless and trivial way. Would she have been similarly upset if you'd sworn aloud? Because the effect is basically the same.", "NTA.             \nSounds like a frustrating situation. You were giving free labor. For a friend. There should be a certain amount of goofing around leeway. Also a certain amount of gratitude for said free work. Along with extra willingness to make your job easier. Like not letting the dogs in the room you\u2019re painting in.\nIt\u2019s your time. You get to use it how you want. \nThere is no part of your story that sounded fun or benefited you at all. Congrats you got your weekends back. Enjoy.", "Remind your friend that you were helping out of the goodness of your heart for free , and that it was his wife that caused the issue", "NTA it\u2019s covered. Your friend said you could not come back until you apologized. You\u2019re not apologizing, so therefore, you are not welcome back in their house. It seems pretty simple to me. They need to change their stance and say you do not have to apologize. And then when it\u2019s convenient if you wish to do so, you can finish the work until then they need to pick up a paintbrush and a roller and figure this out themselves.", "NTA - I had an uncle, named Doug, who was a painter by trade. Handyman all around, great dude. Helped my folks with tons of stuff over the years. This is the MO, they do this stuff all the time. I remember seeing pencil drawings as he was laying out the gloss/matte paint lines in our dining room: one giant penis, labelled \"Doug\" then one magnified image showing a tiny penis, labelled \"Scott\" (my dads name), it was hilarious, but it got painted over all the same.\n\nConstruction workers, contractors, handymen, plumbers, trade workers of all sorts have a hard job and a little silly graffiti that will get covered up and not seen by the public is fair game. There is probably 10-12 instances of profanity somewhere on every construction site. None of you know how many cuss words are written on your floor joists, drawn into the outside of your foundation concrete, but they're there. It's a non-zero number for sure.", "NTA... and maybe it's time to find some new friends.", "Are you the asshole? Fuck no. When the dog jumped on you & messed up the primer and the wife laughed I'd  probably have left then. But to demand an apology from you & not let you return until you did apologize was a funny turn of events.

She seems pretty and prudish", "NTA mate. Personally have laughed if I saw it. It's primer for fogs sake.", "Nta they are.  She let the dogs in then laughed at the she messed caused and the extra work for you. Nope not your friends.  They are using you as free labor.  Never insult free labor unless you are willing to do the work yourself or pay for someone else to do it.", "Tell the guy painting our house for free not to come back unless he apologizes for using profanity.\n\nWhy am I not getting my house painted for free? \n\nHow ridiculous. Why are you friends with these people? NTA", "NTA. Your friend\u2019s wife is a toxic person and she owes you the apology for letting her dog run rampant.\n\nYour friend is probably getting it in the ear from his wife, let him know you\u2019re free to talk with him privately so she can\u2019t interfere. \n\nFinally, do not apologise.", "Perhaps you were a tad of an AH for reacting childishly, but I totally get your frustration with this woman and her seeming lack of ability to see how her dogs' antics were not amusing to you.  She's a big AH for that.  AND, your \"friend\" is also an AH for expecting you to continue working for free after you feel you are owed the apology and some consideration and even appreciation for what you are doing free gratis for them.  You are NOT the hired help, you are a craftsman offering free services.  Actually, the three of you need to get together and hash this out IF you want to continue the relationship going forward.  It's not okay what happened and she needs to apologize for what she caused and then you can apologize for your reaction.\n\nHowever, under no circumstances are you responsible for continuing to offer your free services unless and until this matter is resolved to your satisfaction.  And even then you are still not responsible, just a friend willing to help a friend.", "NTA and she has some nerve. Also, this is a hilarious punishment. \"Apologize or you will no longer be allowed to do free work for me!\"", "NTA. I would actually find that pretty funny and a great story when you have guests over. \u201cDid you know it actually says \u2018fuck\u2019 on that wall? My dog accosted the painter, so he made a joke about it.\u201d\n\nWhen we redid our floors in my home growing up, we drew all over the ones getting covered. We did body outlines and stupid kid stuff.

It\u2019s still there for the next people to find when they redo the floors!", "NTA - did they pay you anything? cause if not they definitely should have. you painted their place, i think they should be the one apologizing. if they\u2019re really that childish, i\u2019d say just apologize and move on so they drop it.", "NTA, I wouldn\u2019t help someone like that", "Nta", "NTA. It\u2019d be different if they had kids (specifically kids that can read), but that wife just sounds controlling and almost like an instigator. I mean was there really a reason for you to paint that on the wall, no, but there\u2019s no harm done so I don\u2019t think it makes you an asshole.", "Everyone's childish here.", "NTA. Enjoy your weekends off.", "If your friend can\u2019t see how you\u2019re not in the wrong and can\u2019t see how his wife is being ridiculous, then he\u2019s actually not a friend. Definitely NTA. They can paint themselves or actually spend some money.", "I'm going to go with ESH. Dogs sometimes get into things, accidents happens. But she shouldn't have been so blase about her response, especially when you're doing them a favor. She should have apologized and then asked what she could do to help.\n\nYour reaction was pretty juvenile and passive aggressive. I get that it gets painted over, but you're inconvenienced and write a curse word in big letters on the wall? Just a weirdly over the top reaction. It did nothing to address the situation, and just made it clear you were stewing.\n\nHer husband should have had a convo with you about what happened, why it bothered you, and why your response bothered her. Not demand an apology.", "NTA well, well, well, if it isn't they consequences of ones own actions, come to visit? It's amazing how many people are so completely surprised that people who do them favours do not like being treated poorly.", "NTA. An experienced good *free* painter is worth his/her weight in gold! Letting the dogs into a room in progress causing the paint in the pan to be ruined and extra cleaning was a stupid move, thinking it was funny was more stupid. \n\n\"Retaliation\" in primer is no big deal, a bit of time and was gone. \n\nThey told you not to come back if you didn't apologize, and that's fine. Don't. The people calling you out for it are neither paying or painting and think your free time is theirs to play with. It was a nice and friendly effort by you, but it just didn't work out.", "NTA.

There was no need for it and you know it was cause trouble. You are a problem starter and frankly thats not a very desirably trait in any situation. If you didn\u2019t want help them out, why did you? If you were mad about the dog just walk away. God, drama starters like you make the world an actively more difficult place for everyone.", "ESH. She shouldn\u2019t have laughed it off when the dogs jumped on you, and you shouldn\u2019t have vandalized their house (even if you were going to paint over it, it was vandalism, and was childish of you to do that). \nYou\u2019re both acting very immature. She is being childish for threatening to ban you from their house until you apologize; you didn\u2019t leave any lasting damage or issues. Your friend is awkwardly caught in the middle. I dont fault him for defending his wife because that\u2019s what a good partner does, but I think he should disagree with her about banning you if you don\u2019t apologize. This is something that could have been resolved through effective communication, but instead you\u2019re both being stubborn and petty. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re solely in the wrong, and I feel that she\u2019s being more of an AH. But as an adult, for the sake of your friendships, I think you should apologize, explain what had upset you before doing that (without blaming her for causing your action), explain how you reacted to that feeling (priming a curse word on the wall in primer), why you thought that was an appropriate action to take (it\u2019s primer; it won\u2019t be visible by the end of the paint job), and why you realize now that you were in the wrong.\n\nThis all could have been avoided by 1. Her being more aware of how the dogs might bother you while trying to paint their house as a favour), and 2. You communicating your feelings to her respectfully in that moment, after she had laughed it off- and if she invalidated your feelings in response, you could have ignored her, carried on, (or walk out on the spot to cool down) and raised it with your friend later to address the rude behaviour with his wife.", "ESH. It's all kinda petty", "ESH - Them for pushing for the apology and you for painting a swear on their wall. \n\nSure, it was painted in primer but instead of talking to your friends about how you were inconvenienced while helping them, you were childish and *I wrote the word \"FUCK\" in huge letters on the wall*. yes yes, it was in primer but that doesn't negate what you did.\n\nBe an adult and use your words next time.", "YTA.  99.9% of the people met with that situation would have just said fuck, you had to write it on the wall.  I've got to agree with the wife, you sound like a shitty person.", "ESH, mostly them.  The dog was an accident, but they should have apologized and offered to replace your clothes.   You shouldn't have written profanity on the wall even if it was going to be painted over. They are AH for not being more grateful and said bad things to people about you.  You both need to apologize and move forward.  Just to be clear, I dont think you are an AH for not going back under the circumstances.", "Let them figure out how to finish the work. \n\nYour friend's wife isn't acting rational. \n\nNTA", "> His wife laughed it off like it was not a big deal that I had paw prints on me.\n\nOn your painting clothes, right?

It is a fixer upper and I have been helping them out with the fixing. \n\nMy father was a handyman and contractor so I have a lot of skills and experience with doing maintenance, repairs, and upgrades on a house. I also have pretty much all the tools I need to do most of the work. \n\nThis last weekend I was helping paint the dining room. I had everything set up the way I wanted and I was ready to go. For some fucking reason his wife decides to let their dogs into the room I'm painting. \n\nOne of them steps in the roller tray and then jumps up on me. His wife laughed it off like it was not a big deal that I had paw prints on me. I also had to throw out that primer because  it now had mud in it. I had told them both to let me do the work in peace. \n\nAfter I prepared a new tray of paint I wrote the word \"FUCK\" in huge letters on the wall. IN PRIMER. \n\nFor those of you who may not know primer is the coat of paint that you put down before the actual paint. For lack of a better word it sticks to the wall better and when it dries it creates a better surface for the paint to stick to. \n\nHis wife saw it and freaked. She said I was drawing profanity in her house. I told her it was primer and to stay out of my way. \n\nI then finished the job and went home. My friend called me and said that I had really upset his wife with my childishness and that she would not let me back until I apologized. I asked him what I was apologizing for. He said that I wrote a curse word on his wall. I asked him to provide a picture. He said he couldn't since I had painted over it. I asked what the problem was since the word wasn't there any more. He said that I needed to apologize. I said that him wanting me to apologize was in no way the same as me needing to apologize. He said that I could not come back until I did. No problem for me. I was helping him for free on my weeks off from work. \n\nHe called me two days later and asked if I was coming to finish painting since I would be away at work for three weeks. I said I wasn't ready to apologize yet and maybe I would when I got back. I probably won't. \n\nNow she is telling everyone that I'm a shitty person for leaving a job half finished. I tell everyone who asks that I was working for free and that they told me not to come back. \n\nNow there is a big fight in our friend group between the people who think I should keep the peace and those who think she is being an entitled whiner. No one else is volunteering to help at their house and now either they have to half ass the job or pay someone. I'm getting hell for that too. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Based on both assumptions, your response to the dogs getting into the paint and jumping on you seemed way over dramatic. Handyman clothes are meant to get messy. More paint can be purchased at the store. Yeah, she could have apologized then. You said she laughed - I assume in embarrassment of her dog\u2019s actions and not to humiliate you. But I feel like you took it way too personally, and writing a curse word in paint - which you clearly wanted her to see - is immature and petty. So she got upset too, and overreacted as well. I read a comment in which you said you preferred your friend more before he married. I\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t like his wife (or have some sort of resentment burning somewhere toward the friend) and let this blow up into something much bigger than necessary. If I were you, I\u2019d really try to figure out why YOU let this go so far. You can\u2019t control other people, but you can control your reactions - and your reactions are petty and harsh. Why?
