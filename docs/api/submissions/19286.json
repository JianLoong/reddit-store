The issue is your son doesn't want to share but wants others to share with him. He needs to learn that this isn't realistic and he's 100% old enough to understand that. It's not fair that he can use your daughter's game but not share his own while he's using hers. This is a brilliant use of reality based parenting. He doesn't want to share? Ok. You're not going to lose anything BUT no one is required to share with you either. If he wants to be included then he needs to reciprocate. Learning this now is better than in college when roommates start to exclude him for the same behaviors.", "Absolutely NTA! Well done for teaching your son that he if he cannot share then why should anyone share with him. Hopefully this will be a life lesson for him", "NTA. Appropriate punishment. He can still play the ps4 and maybe it will hit him sooner than later and he will apologize at least as it seems that now he does not even get it. \nYour husband's reaction is weird though and I would keep an eye on that as it seems he was perfectly content with your daughter being stiffed - and thats concerning.", "NTA\n\nLook, I get it. Zelda is basically the most addictive game on the planet. But either everyone shares or no one does. My daughters are close in age and interests and share a room, so most things are shared. They each have special things that are *just* theirs, but the majority of toys and crafts are used by both (usually together). Whenever an argument devolves to the point of arguing about who technically owns what, I offer to help them split up their toys but warn them that they'll both be unhappy with the outcome.", "Who's being excluded that your husband is being pissed off about? It's kind of unclear.", "NTA.  He was learning what mine is mine and what's yours is mine.  He needed a serious check and you gave it to him.  That is solid parenting.  I will say that you need to leave room for him to come around.  If he decides to share his things he should be let back into the loop.", "Yknow what, i figured this would be a clear Y T A, but it isnt.\n\nYou can't use someone elses console and then refuse to share yours, thats daft.\n\nNTA. Your husband is being a bit silly really.", "He's gotta learn to share somehow. At 15 he should already be able to.   \nNTA but if this doesn't work maybe it goes a little deeper than just not wanting to share his console.  \nI'd recommend trying to talk to him about it one on one and hear him out as to the why he doesn't want to share.", "Nta. He doesn't get to make free range of his sisters possessions then play gate keeper with his own. What he was doing showed a huge lack of respect and consideration for others. Especially his sister who was letting him use her console at that. 15 is way too old for this behavior at that, you did good doing something", "NTA.  He's 15 and acting like he's 5, and your husband is definitely enabling him.

Why does you husband think your son comes before your daughter?", "NTA here, though really the problem isn't him not sharing his things, it's him monopolizing other people's things AND not sharing his things.  So the punishment fits.", "NTA. He can't have it both ways, either he should share or he should have sole access to his stuff while forgoing access to others' stuff. IMO you're still being very fair to him.", "NTA your daughter asked for HER switch back and he said no. You\u2019re just enforcing the fact that they are in charge of their own individual items.

At 15 he should understand that he can't have it both ways. I think this is a fitting punsihment. Your husband is right, this is excluding him, and that's the whole point. If your son cannot understand that he can't expect other people to share their stuff and not share his own, he's going to be excluded.", "NTA this is exactly what you should have done.

He\u2019s being a brat. Sharing is a two way street.", "NTA, if he doesn't share he shouldn't be shared with.", "NTA - this seems completely reasonable.  IF he isn't willing to share, there is no reason why anyone should have to share with him.  Does your husband always favor your son?", "NTA. You addressed this perfectly!", "NTA. Sounds like you are parenting.", "NTA I like what you did there, you\u2019re a great parent.", "NTA. My kids aren\u2019t even in the double digits yet but I\u2019ve laid down a hard rule of they only get to set rules in their respective rooms. Anywhere else in the house you have to share. So if you play with legos in the living room you have to be willing to let your younger sister play with some too. If that isn\u2019t what you want, you can take them to your room. Conversely, if you bring a room toy out to the living room you have to be willing to share. \n\nIt has helped my son deal with having a toddler for a sister while he is going through some pre-teen angst. \n\nIt sounds like you laid down a similar rule because of your son\u2019s unwillingness to share; he doesn\u2019t have to share, but if he won\u2019t join in with family expectations then those benefits also don\u2019t extend to him. \n\nI think your idea to revisit his opinion on how things are going after a week is a good one. I don\u2019t know why your husband is upset with you, sometimes parenting has to happen in the moment without time to check in with the other parent.", "NTA, those are reasonable consequences,until he can apologize and share", "NTA. If he was the only one sharing, it would be one thing, but he's taking his sister's device all the time. He's spoiled, and it sounds like your husband is feeding into it. Don't back down.", "NTA", "NTA", "INFO: Who paid for the PS4?", "NTA.  This was a good solution.", "I don't understand why you didn't just tip of your daughter, that if she wants to take her switch back, she can? \n\nWouldn't that be the obviously solution?

If he doesn't want to share his stuff with his siblings, he has really not right to use their stuff, especially not so much that his sister can't even use her Switch anymore.", "NTA, he's gonna appreciate that later.", "Unless the younger sibling has a history of breaking things, NTA(he still has a ps4 to play with)", "NTA but I\u2019m concerned as to why your husband seems okay with his behavior", "NTA.  Your son is being selfish and you're parenting him!  Good on you!", "NTA. Kids need to learn boundaries and you did a great job setting them up.", "NTA  It's called discipline and learning how to share which your 15 year old son should know by now.  His siblings do, but he doesn't.  Tell your husband that you are not excluding him, he is being grounded from those things as a punishment.  Your teen needs to learn he is not the only person in the world or your house who gets to the PS4.", "NTA, you did a great job. I have 3 younger siblings and the oldest of the 3 wanted to use all of their stuff but never wanted to share his own, because he grew up a few years ahead and just wasn\u2019t interested in their stuff until it came to electronics and gaming consoles, so he never truly learnt how to share. The younger ones were twins so understood that sharing could benefit them.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s a similar situation and you can use it as a learning moment in their life.", "My grandparents didn't do anything with this same situation with my mom and my uncle. My mom despises the legend of Zelda now and my uncle is a raging drug addict that will literally pull out a gun or assault someone if he doesn't get his way. \n\nNTA", "NTA- he\u2019d have no console if he was mine. Either share or don\u2019t reap the benefits. If 2 of the 3 kids is happy then you did the right thing. \nAlso you have a husband problem if he thinks type of behavior is okay. He\u2019s not a baby, he knows what he\u2019s doing and giving in will result in your other kids resenting him, you and your husband. Stand firm.", "NTA he does want to share and needs to be taught", "NTA assuming this lasts for only a week or so, if he doesn't get the message by then you may need to switch tactics.", "There is a stage of development where children become fully capable of conceptualizing sharing and feeling the natural urge to share, rather than doing it because they are told. It's later than most people would think; it requires a working understanding of ownership, empathy, and patience, which is pretty advanced stuff for a little one to grasp. Most kids pick it up around eight years old.\n\nGood luck with your son. NTA", "I\u2019m confused. Does the switch belong to Sara or is it community property in your family? If it belongs to her and she asks for it back but he refuses then why aren\u2019t you as a parent stepping in and being an arbitrator to make him either let her use the ps4 or give the switch back? If the switch is community property and the ps4 isn\u2019t then why is he being penalized if he isn\u2019t breaking any set rules?", "NTA.  Personally I would have taken away his PS4 (and any other electronics he has) in addition to what you\u2019ve already done.", "He hogs her switch and won't let her play his console in the meantime? Duh! Good job, mom, he needs to have that entitled selfish switch flipped sooner than later.", "NTA. If anything you waited far too long. This should've been shut down the first time he refused to return the Switch to your daughter when asked. That's the price of using someone else's stuff; if they ask, you have to give it back ASAP. Don't like being interrupted, buy your own.", "NTA, logical consequences. \n\nHe refuses to share, he loses access to it.", "You're the parent. Make screen time rules and enforce them.\n\nMy kids are only allowed screen time for 1 hour on Saturday and 1 hour Sunday.", "NTA. Seems like a very logical way to teach this lesson.", "NTA but you and your husband need to be on the same page. Your 15 year old isn\u2019t being excluded. It\u2019s his choice whether to change his behavior so he can borrow his sister\u2019s Switch again.", "I am once again coming to this subreddit to say that I don\u2019t think this is a good place to ask for parenting advice. This isn\u2019t your messy roommate, your overbearing mother in law or your annoying colleague, it\u2019s your child! You\u2019re asking for parenting advice from people who are almost certainly not qualified to give it. Do you not have any friends or family that have kids that you can ask?", "NTA.  Sharing is a two-way street, and if you don\u2019t share, you shouldn\u2019t expect others to share with you.", "NTA. You have a husband problem.", "NTA. He's 15 and acting like he's 5, and your husband is definitely enabling him. Make sure he absolutely cannot get access to your daughter's Switch at any point, and if he tries to skirt the rules, take away the PS4 for a while.", "[removed]", "I can't get my husband off that game some days. I didn't realize how addictive it was until then \ud83d\ude02", "He has his own stuff. The PS4 is his and hasn't been taken away from him. OP is just saying that from now on he can't have his siblings' stuff too.", "OP isn't forcing him to share it, just saying that if he won't share then other people don't have to share with him. That's entirely fair and reasonable.", "That would be okay IF he wasn\u2019t used no his sisters stuff AND not giving it back when she asks.

Once he's out on his own, he doesn't have to share anything.", "NTA, reading some of the other comments from below, you may want to add that he's physically preventing his sister from using her Switch, and that's NOT SHARING.\n\nShe's learned that she can't physically overpower her brother, and if he just snatches it from her in an unguarded moment, it's \"his\" for as long as he wants it. That's bullying, which is a separate issue from what you'd asked about.\n\nIf Dad is seeing this as \"my poor son just didn't want to share his gaming console and my wife went nuclear\" he may need to have a reality check.\n\nAlso totally separate, but does he think he has the crappy console and his sister has the \"good one\" or is it just \"Zelda fever?\" Either way, get your daughter a password she doesn't share, and have her set a timer for how long anyone can play on her console.", "I'm surprised he's got to the age of 15 without this being an issue before.", "I'm surprised your husband didn't have a problem with the boy's behavior. I'm not sure if you took his ps4 away or if you just barred him from using everyone else's stuff (or both). Either case, it's appropriate action lol. It comes down to the fact that none of them own anything. You bought it, it's in your house. His usage was gifted out of your benevolence. He returns your kindness by showing kindness to others. No kindness for others, son, no kindness for you. You get what you give, so give what you want. Solid truth of the world around us. I think dad needs to learn that lesson too.\n\nNTA. But dad sure is.\n\nEdited for a really weird typo", " He doesn\u2019t HAVE to share but the problem is that he expects his sister to share.", "It would be one thing if NTA was the only one she shared, but she's taking her sister's device all the time. She's spoiled, and it sounds like your husband is feeding off of it. Don't back down.", "He asked for a sweet and he said no so my dad got the big box of quality street tipped them out and when my brother asked for one he said no.", "But if she does allow him to play with her Switch again, you have to be prepared to jump in there if his poor behavior starts back up. Don\u2019t wait to let it escalate for a few weeks before acting. You\u2019ll create a cycle of him refusing to share, being temporarily punished, and then getting what he wants again. This will probably require you to set some clear rules around sharing consoles for him, whether that\u2019s \u201cyou can play your sister\u2019s Switch for an hour a day\u201d or \u201cyou can play your sister\u2019s Switch until she asks for it back\u201d or whatever else.", "This is why I'm so against gifting children toys that can be used selfishly like this. \n\nIt should be the family's gaming systems that everyone has equal access to. Then it's sharing from the get go.", "That\u2019s why my wife won\u2019t let me get it, she knows I\u2019d be on it for hours and hours. \ud83d\ude05", "Depends on who gifted it to them.  I have no issue taking away things I gave my children as punishment for things they\u2019ve done.", "This is a great example of natural consequences. If you don't want to share your item, that's fine, but they don't have to share it with you", "I'm not surprised about the dad. \"Boys will be boys\"-attitude and favoring sons over daughters is still common.", "I'll bet the dad is pissed b/c he can't play the Zelda game now, since it's technically his son's. lol \n\nOh, and NTA, OP. Well done!", "I thought about recommending deleting his account but I think that would backfire as he would retaliate by doing the same thing to his sister\u2019s acct the first chance he gets.", "that wouldn't teach him any sort of lesson, all it would do was make him angry and probably retaliate. NTA op but probably don't take reddits advice on how to discipline ur kid", "I could see if the kid bought the system with his own money, or the sister is danger prone and consoles disintegrate before her might. \n \nBut if you're using HER switch, then be cool and let her play  spiderman. Hell, I bought my cousins spare controllers and memory cards back when we were weirdos on the ps2.", "Nah, you can have your own. But you don't get to borrow consoles if you won't share your console.\n\nPerfectly fair.", "OP never said if the ps4 was a gift or if the son worked, saved and bought it.", "He wasn't trying to play with the PS4. That's the point, he was actively playing the Switch and refused to give it up to give his sister a turn, so she decided to play a different game on the PS4. He said no, she can't play the PS4 that he was NOT using. He doesn't get to hog TWO different gaming systems at the same time. \n\nAnd the devil doesn't need an advocate.", "I gave up trying to play video games because my mom didn't want to tell the Golden boy no about anything. He would make up rules to favor himself and breathe down my neck when I would play. My mom would encourage me to play when he wasn't around but I actually wanted to play WITH him. So I gave up. Same as any game ever. Board games, card games, everything ruined. He was never made to play fair.", "Because he's sexist.", "Does the younger sibling destroy controllers or anything? Also, who bought the PS4? Did your son save up and buy it himself? Also, who bought the Switch?\n\nCould be a case of resentment?", "What will you do if your husband continues to disagree with your decision and openly countermands you?", ">icing him out\n\nThey're still talking to him ffs", "Because the switch was already in his hands. Sister was fine with him playing for a little while and then wanted a turn. At THAT POINT, since he was refusing, the only option was parental intervention or a physical fight between siblings. OP chose parental intervention. I do not understand your issue here...", "If she gets the Switch parental control app she can also set play time limits so she'd still be able to lend it to him if she wanted to but for the exact amount of time that she specifies - no more \"one more minute\" nonsense", "He's still able to be WITH the family - he just can't use his sibling's stuff.", "I'm curious if there's an attitude here from the son or the father that the son's gaming is a hobby but daughter's gaming isn't \"real\" gaming."]}
