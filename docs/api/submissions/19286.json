The issue is your son doesn't want to share but wants others to share with him. He needs to learn that this isn't realistic and he's 100% old enough to understand that. It's not fair that he can use your daughter's game but not share his own while he's using hers. This is a brilliant use of reality based parenting. He doesn't want to share? Ok. You're not going to lose anything BUT no one is required to share with you either. If he wants to be included then he needs to reciprocate. Learning this now is better than in college when roommates start to exclude him for the same behaviors.", "Absolutely NTA! Well done for teaching your son that he if he cannot share then why should anyone share with him. Hopefully this will be a life lesson for him", "NTA. Appropriate punishment. He can still play the ps4 and maybe it will hit him sooner than later and he will apologize at least as it seems that now he does not even get it. \nYour husband's reaction is weird though and I would keep an eye on that as it seems he was perfectly content with your daughter being stiffed - and thats concerning.", "NTA\n\nLook, I get it. Zelda is basically the most addictive game on the planet. But either everyone shares or no one does. My daughters are close in age and interests and share a room, so most things are shared. They each have special things that are *just* theirs, but the majority of toys and crafts are used by both (usually together). Whenever an argument devolves to the point of arguing about who technically owns what, I offer to help them split up their toys but warn them that they'll both be unhappy with the outcome.", "Who's being excluded that your husband is being pissed off about? It's kind of unclear.", "NTA.  He was learning what mine is mine and what's yours is mine.  He needed a serious check and you gave it to him.  That is solid parenting.  I will say that you need to leave room for him to come around.  If he decides to share his things he should be let back into the loop.", "Yknow what, i figured this would be a clear Y T A, but it isnt.\n\nYou can't use someone elses console and then refuse to share yours, thats daft.\n\nNTA. Your husband is being a bit silly really.", "He's gotta learn to share somehow. At 15 he should already be able to.   \nNTA but if this doesn't work maybe it goes a little deeper than just not wanting to share his console.  \nI'd recommend trying to talk to him about it one on one and hear him out as to the why he doesn't want to share.", "Nta. He doesn't get to make free range of his sisters possessions then play gate keeper with his own. What he was doing showed a huge lack of respect and consideration for others. Especially his sister who was letting him use her console at that. 15 is way too old for this behavior at that, you did good doing something", "NTA.  He's 15 and acting like he's 5, and your husband is definitely enabling him.  Make sure he absolutely cannot get access to your daughter's Switch at any point, and if he tries to skirt the rules, take away the PS4 for a while.", "So he was allowed to use his sister\u2019s switch as much as he wanted but his sister was not allowed to use his PlayStation whilst he monopolized the use of her console? \n\nNTA", "NTA your son doesn\u2019t want to share his ps4, fair enough.

Why does you husband think your son comes before your daughter?", "NTA here, though really the problem isn't him not sharing his things, it's him monopolizing other people's things AND not sharing his things.  So the punishment fits.", "NTA. He can't have it both ways, either he should share or he should have sole access to his stuff while forgoing access to others' stuff. IMO you're still being very fair to him.", "NTA your daughter asked for HER switch back and he said no. You\u2019re just enforcing the fact that they are in charge of their own individual items.

At 15 he should understand that he can't have it both ways. I think this is a fitting punsihment. Your husband is right, this is excluding him, and that's the whole point. If your son cannot understand that he can't expect other people to share their stuff and not share his own, he's going to be excluded.", "NTA this is exactly what you should have done. If he doesn't want to share his things then he shouldn't expect to share their things.", "Kinda sounds like you're teaching your other kids to say no, and he already knew how to do that. NTA", "NTA. He\u2019s being a brat. Sharing is a two way street.", "NTA, if he doesn't share he shouldn't be shared with.", "NTA - this seems completely reasonable.  IF he isn't willing to share, there is no reason why anyone should have to share with him.  Does your husband always favor your son?", "NTA. You addressed this perfectly!", "NTA. Sounds like you are parenting.", "NTA I like what you did there, you\u2019re a great parent.", "NTA. My kids aren\u2019t even in the double digits yet but I\u2019ve laid down a hard rule of they only get to set rules in their respective rooms. Anywhere else in the house you have to share. So if you play with legos in the living room you have to be willing to let your younger sister play with some too. If that isn\u2019t what you want, you can take them to your room. Conversely, if you bring a room toy out to the living room you have to be willing to share. \n\nIt has helped my son deal with having a toddler for a sister while he is going through some pre-teen angst. \n\nIt sounds like you laid down a similar rule because of your son\u2019s unwillingness to share; he doesn\u2019t have to share, but if he won\u2019t join in with family expectations then those benefits also don\u2019t extend to him. \n\nI think your idea to revisit his opinion on how things are going after a week is a good one. I don\u2019t know why your husband is upset with you, sometimes parenting has to happen in the moment without time to check in with the other parent.", "NTA, those are reasonable consequences,until he can apologize and share", "NTA. If he was the only one sharing, it would be one thing, but he's taking his sister's device all the time. He's spoiled, and it sounds like your husband is feeding into it. Don't back down.", "NTA", "NTA", "INFO: Who paid for the PS4?", "NTA.  This was a good solution.", "I don't understand why you didn't just tip of your daughter, that if she wants to take her switch back, she can? \n\nWouldn't that be the obviously solution?

I only say that based on your sons reactions to things and his behavior plus your husbands defense of him. Good on you for trying to teach your son the importance of sharing and mutual respect on sharing personal belongings.", "Absolutely NTA. Thats a very reasonable consequence. It sounds like maybe your husband needs lessons in how sharing works too if he's so concerned about the son not being able to do his \"hobbies\" but hadnt bothered when your daughter wasnt able to do hers.", "NTA", "NTA - and now you know which kid is your husband's favorite.", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t get to use her gaming system and not let her use his", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nLet us know when your husband buys your son a switch behind your back.", "NTA, it's a good life lesson for the future. Hopefully it will serve him well.", "NTA\n\nSounds like Hubby has a favorite...", "Maybe you should apply this creative solution to helping you husband to learn that teaching his kids to be decent if more important than his gaming life? NTA.  Thank you for, hopefully, making one less selfish jerk in the world.", "NTA: Sounds fair. He has no problem using her stuff but won\u2019t let her borrow his .", "NTA but I also feel like there needs to be a built in mechanism or time limit to give him a chance to learn his lesson and be a better sharer.\n\nYou should probably also come to a family consensus about what sharing/borrowing means. Because, honestly, if something is mine, I don't have to share it with you. But if I'm not going to share with you, I shouldn't expect you to share with me. And if you've been kind enough to let me use your stuff, I have no right to hold it hostage because I'm not done with it. \n\nBasically, owners have all the leverage, but your son needs to learn how to be a decent human. Unless there was some explainable reason - that he should have stated - for Sis to not use the PS4 (an update was going on, he had a game paused, he was expecting to start a co-op game soon) there was no reason to not let her use it while he used *her stuff*. And it was really her doing him a favor by allowing him to continue to use her stuff asking only to use his in return.", "NTA but Your husband is an AH.", "Unless he paid for the PS4 himself, then OP is NTA.", "NTA. You handled this really well, he'll thank you for it someday", "Nta.. Hold your ground mom. If he can't share his things, no one has to share their things with him. Tell your hubby to kick rocks, he is obviously part of the problem.", "NTA\nHe can't hog his sister's game system while refusing to share his own.  ToTK is a 70 hour game that can drag out to twice that time if you're a completionist.  It's not like he was asking her to wait while he played solitaire.\n\nAlso, he wasn't respecting the owner of the switch who was telling him to return her property and offering a mutually beneficial agreement when he objected.  He doesn't get to just steal his sister's stuff whenever he feels like it for as long as he feels like it.  Gross.", "NTA but If you want your kids to share stuff, set up a schedule of who uses what when or make those kinds of electronics family items, not individual items. Or tell them that a condition of \"owning\" the item is sharing it on some kind of schedule. I don't think you can expect undeveloped brains to work this stuff out on their own. Be the parent and tell them how it's going to work, don't just expect them to work it out on their own because clearly they can't and you need to step in.", "NTA, what you're doing is called parenting.", "\"my husband on the other hand was pissed, going on how this is excluding him and that he won\u2019t get to do his hobby\"\n\nNot sure what you mean by this.", "NTA when your son is happy to hog everyone else's stuff, but won't share his own, then I think it's ok to block him out of the pool of shared goods. This should be a good lesson for him and hopefully he learns it, but your husband is being an asshole and blowing up any progress you might have made because now your son is going to side with dad and make you out to be the evil villain. Your husband is an asshole, and in this case a bad dad. Lessons are learned best when the parents show a united front.", "Won't get to do his hobby? He has a PS4. He can play on that. No hobby lost, he's getting exactly what he wants.\nI would say though, make it clear it's up to the person to share. If his siblings don't want to share, they don't have to, but don't stop them from doing so if they want to.\n\nAnyways, NTA.", "NTA.", "Yeah this is prime example of teaching someone the golden rule: treat others how you would want to be treated. He\u2019ll learn and start sharing or he won\u2019t and he won\u2019t get to play with other peoples stuff", "Yeah, I had an older brother and sister and was told to share starting at a young age.  Hell one time at christmas my brother apparently didnt' get the lego set he wanted and wanted what I got so I just gave him mine and took his.  I didn't care, I wanted legos.  I got lots of cred for that one for years with the family haha.", "Well the kids an entitled ass so what your point", "Because child abuse it wrong. Don\u2019t hit children", "INFO: why does your husband like this kid more than your other kids?", "I\u2019m shocked that you would let your son walk all over your daughter for so long without intervening yikes", "> but don't expect the other kids to share theirs then.\n\nThat would apply if it were the other kids deciding not to share with him, but backup from the parents, but it isn\u2019t.\n\nLet\u2019s take the other brother for example:\n\n> all other things that were shared with the family he doesn\u2019t have access too. My other sons popcorns stash for another example. \n\nMaybe they have a great relationship where they share a lot. Maybe both are happy with the things being shared, and the things *not* being shared. \n\nBut now the parents unilaterally decided that they are not allowed to choose to share things with each other if one brother declines to share one thing.
