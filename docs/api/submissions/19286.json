The issue is your son doesn't want to share but wants others to share with him. He needs to learn that this isn't realistic and he's 100% old enough to understand that. It's not fair that he can use your daughter's game but not share his own while he's using hers. This is a brilliant use of reality based parenting. He doesn't want to share? Ok. You're not going to lose anything BUT no one is required to share with you either. If he wants to be included then he needs to reciprocate. Learning this now is better than in college when roommates start to exclude him for the same behaviors.", "Absolutely NTA! Well done for teaching your son that he if he cannot share then why should anyone share with him. Hopefully this will be a life lesson for him", "NTA. Appropriate punishment. He can still play the ps4 and maybe it will hit him sooner than later and he will apologize at least as it seems that now he does not even get it. \nYour husband's reaction is weird though and I would keep an eye on that as it seems he was perfectly content with your daughter being stiffed - and thats concerning.", "NTA\n\nLook, I get it. Zelda is basically the most addictive game on the planet. But either everyone shares or no one does. My daughters are close in age and interests and share a room, so most things are shared. They each have special things that are *just* theirs, but the majority of toys and crafts are used by both (usually together). Whenever an argument devolves to the point of arguing about who technically owns what, I offer to help them split up their toys but warn them that they'll both be unhappy with the outcome.", "Who's being excluded that your husband is being pissed off about? It's kind of unclear.", "NTA.  He was learning what mine is mine and what's yours is mine.  He needed a serious check and you gave it to him.  That is solid parenting.  I will say that you need to leave room for him to come around.  If he decides to share his things he should be let back into the loop.", "Yknow what, i figured this would be a clear Y T A, but it isnt.\n\nYou can't use someone elses console and then refuse to share yours, thats daft.\n\nNTA. Your husband is being a bit silly really.", "He's gotta learn to share somehow. At 15 he should already be able to.   \nNTA but if this doesn't work maybe it goes a little deeper than just not wanting to share his console.  \nI'd recommend trying to talk to him about it one on one and hear him out as to the why he doesn't want to share.", "Nta. He doesn't get to make free range of his sisters possessions then play gate keeper with his own. What he was doing showed a huge lack of respect and consideration for others. Especially his sister who was letting him use her console at that. 15 is way too old for this behavior at that, you did good doing something", "NTA.  He's 15 and acting like he's 5, and your husband is definitely enabling him.  Make sure he absolutely cannot get access to your daughter's Switch at any point, and if he tries to skirt the rules, take away the PS4 for a while.", "So he was allowed to use his sister\u2019s switch as much as he wanted but his sister was not allowed to use his PlayStation whilst he monopolized the use of her console? \n\nNTA", "NTA your son doesn\u2019t want to share his ps4, fair enough. But he needs to realise the same goes for his sister. Why does you husband think your son comes before your daughter?", "NTA here, though really the problem isn't him not sharing his things, it's him monopolizing other people's things AND not sharing his things.  So the punishment fits.", "NTA. He can't have it both ways, either he should share or he should have sole access to his stuff while forgoing access to others' stuff. IMO you're still being very fair to him.", "NTA your daughter asked for HER switch back and he said no. You\u2019re just enforcing the fact that they are in charge of their own individual items. If he wants to share his PS others may choose to share with him too.", "NTA\n\nHe took over someone else's system and refused to let them use his.  He doesn't get to control all the gaming system's in the house unless he buys his own.", "NTA. If he doesn\u2019t share his things, other people don\u2019t need to share with him.", "NTA\n\nHe has this attitude and expectation that he can have his cake and eat it to. At 15 he should understand that he can't have it both ways. I think this is a fitting punsihment. Your husband is right, this is excluding him, and that's the whole point. If your son cannot understand that he can't expect other people to share their stuff and not share his own, he's going to be excluded.", "NTA this is exactly what you should have done. If he doesn't want to share his things then he shouldn't expect to share their things.", "Kinda sounds like you're teaching your other kids to say no, and he already knew how to do that. NTA", "NTA. He\u2019s being a brat. Sharing is a two way street.", "NTA, if he doesn't share he shouldn't be shared with.", "NTA - this seems completely reasonable.  IF he isn't willing to share, there is no reason why anyone should have to share with him.  Does your husband always favor your son?", "NTA. You addressed this perfectly!", "NTA. Sounds like you are parenting.", "NTA I like what you did there, you\u2019re a great parent.", "NTA. My kids aren\u2019t even in the double digits yet but I\u2019ve laid down a hard rule of they only get to set rules in their respective rooms. Anywhere else in the house you have to share. So if you play with legos in the living room you have to be willing to let your younger sister play with some too. If that isn\u2019t what you want, you can take them to your room. Conversely, if you bring a room toy out to the living room you have to be willing to share. \n\nIt has helped my son deal with having a toddler for a sister while he is going through some pre-teen angst. \n\nIt sounds like you laid down a similar rule because of your son\u2019s unwillingness to share; he doesn\u2019t have to share, but if he won\u2019t join in with family expectations then those benefits also don\u2019t extend to him. \n\nI think your idea to revisit his opinion on how things are going after a week is a good one. I don\u2019t know why your husband is upset with you, sometimes parenting has to happen in the moment without time to check in with the other parent.", "NTA, those are reasonable consequences,until he can apologize and share", "NTA. If he was the only one sharing, it would be one thing, but he's taking his sister's device all the time. He's spoiled, and it sounds like your husband is feeding into it. Don't back down.", "NTA", "NTA", "INFO: Who paid for the PS4?", "NTA.  This was a good solution.", "I don't understand why you didn't just tip of your daughter, that if she wants to take her switch back, she can? \n\nWouldn't that be the obviously solution? She wants to play. She isn't allowed his ps. So she takes her switch?\n\n\nYou should encouraged her to not set healthy boundries far earlier. \n\n\n\nEsh", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

How is that fair to others?", "Slight ESH. Your son is old enough that he should understand it's a give and take with sharing, but if you're also going to treat them as the owners of these items and give them autonomy in that regard, I don't think punishing and isolating is the right solution personally. Unless he hasn't responded to having a sit down conversation about how although he isn't obligated to share his possessions, if he expects usage of his sister's items, he has to realize that he sets an expectation that the kindness will be reciprocated.

Can your daughter add a password to her Switch?", "Yeah, that\u2019s not acceptable.

I think banning him from the Switch and having that conversation with him about his behavior towards her is fair, but isolating him from the rest of the family to this degree is unnecessary, especially when he is communicating to her how much he is upset about excluded from his family. He is not even upset about the Switch, he is upset because he is isolated from his parents and siblings. She just ignores that and says it's mild. There's a reason her husband is upset lol. If you think this is going to end in a positive result I really truly disagree with you.", "Your son is FIFTEEN.

It's not like he is in solitary confinement, he simply can't use their stuff anymore - which imo is fair since he kept hogging everyone's stuff. Do that as an adult, results will be the same.

I'd say this is a fair warning.", "Yeah\u2026 the game is long, he spent over 300 hours on the first one", "Again, agree to disagree, you are free to make your own judgement here.
