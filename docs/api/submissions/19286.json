The issue is your son doesn't want to share but wants others to share with him. He needs to learn that this isn't realistic and he's 100% old enough to understand that. It's not fair that he can use your daughter's game but not share his own while he's using hers. This is a brilliant use of reality based parenting. He doesn't want to share? Ok. You're not going to lose anything BUT no one is required to share with you either. If he wants to be included then he needs to reciprocate. Learning this now is better than in college when roommates start to exclude him for the same behaviors.", "Absolutely NTA! Well done for teaching your son that he if he cannot share then why should anyone share with him. Hopefully this will be a life lesson for him", "NTA. Appropriate punishment. He can still play the ps4 and maybe it will hit him sooner than later and he will apologize at least as it seems that now he does not even get it. \nYour husband's reaction is weird though and I would keep an eye on that as it seems he was perfectly content with your daughter being stiffed - and thats concerning.", "NTA\n\nLook, I get it. Zelda is basically the most addictive game on the planet. But either everyone shares or no one does. My daughters are close in age and interests and share a room, so most things are shared. They each have special things that are *just* theirs, but the majority of toys and crafts are used by both (usually together). Whenever an argument devolves to the point of arguing about who technically owns what, I offer to help them split up their toys but warn them that they'll both be unhappy with the outcome.", "Who's being excluded that your husband is being pissed off about? It's kind of unclear.", "NTA.  He was learning what mine is mine and what's yours is mine.  He needed a serious check and you gave it to him.  That is solid parenting.  I will say that you need to leave room for him to come around.  If he decides to share his things he should be let back into the loop.", "Yknow what, i figured this would be a clear Y T A, but it isnt.\n\nYou can't use someone elses console and then refuse to share yours, thats daft.\n\nNTA. Your husband is being a bit silly really.", "He's gotta learn to share somehow. At 15 he should already be able to.   \nNTA but if this doesn't work maybe it goes a little deeper than just not wanting to share his console.  \nI'd recommend trying to talk to him about it one on one and hear him out as to the why he doesn't want to share.", "Nta. He doesn't get to make free range of his sisters possessions then play gate keeper with his own. What he was doing showed a huge lack of respect and consideration for others. Especially his sister who was letting him use her console at that. 15 is way too old for this behavior at that, you did good doing something", "NTA.  He's 15 and acting like he's 5, and your husband is definitely enabling him.  Make sure he absolutely cannot get access to your daughter's Switch at any point, and if he tries to skirt the rules, take away the PS4 for a while.", "So he was allowed to use his sister\u2019s switch as much as he wanted but his sister was not allowed to use his PlayStation whilst he monopolized the use of her console? \n\nNTA", "NTA your son doesn\u2019t want to share his ps4, fair enough.

Why does you husband think your son comes before your daughter?", "NTA here, though really the problem isn't him not sharing his things, it's him monopolizing other people's things AND not sharing his things.  So the punishment fits.", "NTA. He can't have it both ways, either he should share or he should have sole access to his stuff while forgoing access to others' stuff. IMO you're still being very fair to him.", "NTA your daughter asked for HER switch back and he said no. You\u2019re just enforcing the fact that they are in charge of their own individual items.

At 15 he should understand that he can't have it both ways. I think this is a fitting punsihment. Your husband is right, this is excluding him, and that's the whole point. If your son cannot understand that he can't expect other people to share their stuff and not share his own, he's going to be excluded.", "NTA this is exactly what you should have done. If he doesn't want to share his things then he shouldn't expect to share their things.", "Kinda sounds like you're teaching your other kids to say no, and he already knew how to do that. NTA", "NTA. He\u2019s being a brat. Sharing is a two way street.", "NTA, if he doesn't share he shouldn't be shared with.", "NTA - this seems completely reasonable.  IF he isn't willing to share, there is no reason why anyone should have to share with him.  Does your husband always favor your son?", "NTA. You addressed this perfectly!", "NTA. Sounds like you are parenting.", "NTA I like what you did there, you\u2019re a great parent.", "NTA. My kids aren\u2019t even in the double digits yet but I\u2019ve laid down a hard rule of they only get to set rules in their respective rooms. Anywhere else in the house you have to share. So if you play with legos in the living room you have to be willing to let your younger sister play with some too. If that isn\u2019t what you want, you can take them to your room. Conversely, if you bring a room toy out to the living room you have to be willing to share. \n\nIt has helped my son deal with having a toddler for a sister while he is going through some pre-teen angst. \n\nIt sounds like you laid down a similar rule because of your son\u2019s unwillingness to share; he doesn\u2019t have to share, but if he won\u2019t join in with family expectations then those benefits also don\u2019t extend to him. \n\nI think your idea to revisit his opinion on how things are going after a week is a good one. I don\u2019t know why your husband is upset with you, sometimes parenting has to happen in the moment without time to check in with the other parent.", "NTA, those are reasonable consequences,until he can apologize and share", "NTA. If he was the only one sharing, it would be one thing, but he's taking his sister's device all the time. He's spoiled, and it sounds like your husband is feeding into it. Don't back down.", "NTA", "NTA", "INFO: Who paid for the PS4?", "NTA.  This was a good solution.", "I don't understand why you didn't just tip of your daughter, that if she wants to take her switch back, she can? \n\nWouldn't that be the obviously solution?

You failed as a parent here in defending her boundaries, and in letting your son do this for too much.\n\nIMO you could have:  \n1. Put down a hard line that he absolutely does not get to decide when he uses his sister's switch. Give your sister the message that her right to her own property is important and she can come to you for instant help whenever he's hogging it and that you'll enforce him to get off it, and that she only needs to share if she wants to be nice but that she has no obligation to. This goes for his PS4 too. This more accurately models real life dynamics that you DO have full control over your own property and can refuse to share something with someone without any reason if you so wanted to.  \n2. Proactively teach them both that sharing is caring, and remind him how much good stuff he gets from sharing, every day and how you're happy to share with him because you love him and you are family, and that's what family does. \n\nUsing punishment as a go-to solution models inaccurate and bad dynamics, compared to being an adult. Sometimes it is necessary, but if he's got a hard time understanding these things to the point of often acting like this, I'd say you have deeper issues with his parenting than what mere punishments will steer right. Maybe you'll get him to behave better out of fear for consequences, but it might not steer him towards being a compassionate/empathic human.", ">But being loaned one thing doesn\u2019t obligate him to loan a different thing\n\nThen the son only has to give the Switch back; it's that easy!\n\nIf in your analogy you decided to not give your neighbor's lawnmower back to him, it'd be fair for him to be recompensated in another way, through its monetary value. It really isn't anything new. \n\nIn fact, the daughter only decided to use the PS4 when the brother barred her from using her own console. It did not happen in a vacuum. \n\nSimilarly, the punishment only started when the brother decided that his sister's property was his, and he didn't have to repay his sister's for what he had taken from her in anyway (in this case, instead of a monetary value, by momentarily lending her his PS4).\n\nIt had already happened that the brother didn't allow her to use the PS4, and no punishment came out of it. He was only punished when he *also*, on top of that, took her property to not give back anymore.", "NTA, except for waiting till he was 15 to teach him to share.", "Sounds like your son is learning from your husband.", ">She is isolating her son in every way she possibly can\n\nNot having a say on your siblings property, be it food or gaming, is \"isolating in every way possible\" now?\n\nHe gets to learn the importance of sharing, he doesn't have a gag in his mouth.\n\n>The punishment isn't proportionate to what the kid did. \n\nHe has been *bullying* his little sister for 3 weeks + now. OP had already repeatedly intervened and scolded him for it, but he keeps on reoffending. Seems more than fitting, especially at such an age. \n\n>daughter's problems getting her game back was ignored for 3 weeks\n\nIt wasn't ignored, you may want to read further into the OP's comments.", "NTA and your husband's response is concerning. It sounds like he's favouring your older son which given the switch is your daughter's could come across as sexist.\n\nI wonder if your husband experienced something similar as a kid and doesn't want your son to feel the same way he did? I'd rather think that than your husband is sexist, though he might not even realise it?\n\nAsk him why it's fine for your son to stop your daughter playing her game on her console but its not fine for her to play his or for her to take her game back from him? \n\nWhy does she not get to enjoy her hobbies while she's bullied by her brother? \n\nWhy does oldest son get to eat youngest son's sweet stash but doesn't have to give back?\n\nI'd understand if you'd banned him from all consoles or forced him to share his own things but your just enforcing your other kids treating him like his been treating them until he realises what an AH he's been.", "IMHO kids should have to share but then the siblings also have the right not to share. I did something similar. My 15 year old walked out the house and he hasn\u2019t spoken to me since. That was ten years ago. Be very careful it doesn\u2019t blow up in your face.", "NTA . wish my parents would do this with my sister .", "NTA. I mean there's even nothing to question about this. He gotta learn to play nice and not be selfish.\n\nYour husband should also learn not to discriminate between your kids. Sounds like he's favoring your son.", "Best answer I've read so far. You really clarified the issues involved.", ">No kindness for others, son, no kindness for you. You get what you give, so give what you want. Solid truth of the world around us.\n\nThis truly gave me chills, its beautiful and so true. I wish more people understood this, and i agree with everything you said including this.

And his father defending him is how men learn to be so self-serving.", "More like typical elder sibling behaviour. All their stuff is theirs and all the stuff of the young uns is also theirs.
