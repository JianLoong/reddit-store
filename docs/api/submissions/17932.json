He has a bit of separation anxiety that we are going through, but I thought it'd be a good idea to take him to the gym. Its a larger public chain gym, i looked online for a dog policy and didn't see one.  \r  \n\r  \nA few weeks ago I showed up with Iron, the front desk attendant saw it and didn't say anything. The gym employees see him all the time and i've even gotten positive feedback since i've started bringing him.  I've gotten to the point he is reliable on voice command.  However, I guess it was the new environment and he would go up to strangers, i quickly put him on a leash and kept Iron near by.  I brought Iron nearly every day and his behavior improved.  He would just sit there while I worked out, it was special to me to be able to work out with my puppy.  \r  \n\r  \nI received a lot of positive feedback and multiple gymgoers told me my dog was cute and it brought a smile to their face to see Iron.  One day late last week, Iron got away from me and interrupted a strangers workout.  He was pissed.  I quickly apologized and kept him near me.  A different random stranger comes up and tells me I should leave my fucking dog at home and dogs don't belong in gyms.  I get defensive, but stay calm.  I tell him to find a new gym if he has a problem because most people here like my dog coming with me. This guy responds back with just leave your fucking dog at home asshole.  He walks away and left the conversation at that.  \r  \n\r  \nI was telling some friends about what happened and got mixed responses.  Am I wrong for bring my dog to they gym when it seems clear to me that Iron is welcome?", "created_utc": 1684776328, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ox6sn/aita_for_taking_my_dog_to_the_gym/", "score": 232, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Whose got the separation anxiety you or the dog?", "YTA\n\nYou bring your dog just because you can\u2019t find an explicit dog policy???\n\nAsk.  Call and ask - don\u2019t assume that if it isn\u2019t banned, that means it\u2019s allowed.\n\nIt\u2019s a gym.  People don\u2019t want to be dealing with dog hair and dander while they are trying to work out.  It\u2019s even worse because you don\u2019t keep your dog leashed, and let him wander around.  I\u2019m betting the gym\u2019s insurance doesn\u2019t have anything in place for accidents your dog may cause or that may happen to your dog.", "YTA\n\nThe other gym goer is totally right. Leave your dog at home. It seems more than reasonable to me that a person going to the gym would not expect a dog there, let alone a dog running right up to them in their space. The bottom line is you didn't see anywhere that you couldn't take your dog to the gym, so you decided to force your pet onto other people there. You seem to have a history of not being able to control your dog also, to where it's escaping you and running up to other patrons at the gym. You're being beyond rude and selfish by assuming because you got a few positive comments that it's okay for your dog to be there.\n\nYou're an even bigger AH for thinking your dog is more important to the gym than other gym members. You seriously told the other gym member to go to another gym because you're an inconsiderate dog owner? The gym needs a dog policy. That would sort out expectations for paying members. You're probably just upset that your dog wasn't as acceptable at the gym as you thought. You are the one making problems for other people. Don't go blaming others for the situation you created.", "I would go with YTA.\n\nI have an Assistance Dog so I do actively take my dog to the gym with me when I go, but he's trained not to leave my side regardless of the environment we're in. When I tell him to lay in a specific spot, he won't move, regardless of the distraction.\n\nIf you're going to have your dog in the gym (and their policies allow for that), I would highly recommend training your dog not to leave your side while you're there. Your dog getting away from you in a gym could potentially be a danger to people in there (distracting people lifting isn't a good idea) and to your dog (if there are free weights around adding a distraction to that scenario could pose a serious risk).\n\nI don't think you telling the person to leave the gym if they don't like it is appropriate in this situation, as your dog had created a situation where they weren't really in your control. It wasn't just that your dog happened to be in the gym, it was that your dog approached someone else in there and someone saw that your dog wasn't under control.\n\nI think it's more about that than your dog being in the gym with you, personally.", "YTA.

You and the gym would have been sued into oblivion. \n\nI also wonder how a puppy would do with having a dumbbell dropped on its head\u2026probably not good.

I also happen to have a trained service dog that alerts me to my seizures, its people like you that bring your dog everywhere that make it harder for people like me who NEED our animals with us to have that without being given a hard time, Not everyone likes dogs, not everyone has to some people are allergic, some people are afraid. I bring my dog to the gym but he is trained and, on the clock, on a leash ( even if i set in on the ground because he is trained to be by my side)  and would not dare move unless he needed to for my medical benefit or if I let him \"off the clock\" ( i do let him have fun and be a dog) if your dog ran up to someone he could startle them and hurt that other person or your dog, I would have already reported you to the gym as your dog clearly is an issue and just because hes cute does not mean he belongs there. Do better for your dog and your gym, some people need the gym as a safe space and you having a dog there that clearly should not be there is not only rude and disrespectful but absolutely stupid, sounds like you and the dog need training!

I had no means to sanitize everything if a dog had an accident.

Customers and customer satisfaction and complaints drive policy and revisions of policy. And aside from any potential mess - there are always people who are *afraid* of dogs.

He has a bit of separation anxiety that we are going through, but I thought it'd be a good idea to take him to the gym. Its a larger public chain gym, i looked online for a dog policy and didn't see one.  \r  \n\r  \nA few weeks ago I showed up with Iron, the front desk attendant saw it and didn't say anything. The gym employees see him all the time and i've even gotten positive feedback since i've started bringing him.  I've gotten to the point he is reliable on voice command.  However, I guess it was the new environment and he would go up to strangers, i quickly put him on a leash and kept Iron near by.  I brought Iron nearly every day and his behavior improved.  He would just sit there while I worked out, it was special to me to be able to work out with my puppy.  \r  \n\r  \nI received a lot of positive feedback and multiple gymgoers told me my dog was cute and it brought a smile to their face to see Iron.  One day late last week, Iron got away from me and interrupted a strangers workout.  He was pissed.  I quickly apologized and kept him near me.  A different random stranger comes up and tells me I should leave my fucking dog at home and dogs don't belong in gyms.  I get defensive, but stay calm.  I tell him to find a new gym if he has a problem because most people here like my dog coming with me. This guy responds back with just leave your fucking dog at home asshole.  He walks away and left the conversation at that.  \r  \n\r  \nI was telling some friends about what happened and got mixed responses.  Am I wrong for bring my dog to they gym when it seems clear to me that Iron is welcome?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And now that I think about it, it does make sense that a dog distressed by separation/isolation wouldn't really experience any magical improvement by being separated/isolated even more. It does seem like a much more complex issue than I had previously assumed, since based on what you're saying it seems that you need to find ways to positively reinforce separation/isolation in extremely small increments over time so that the stress of being separated/alone doesn't continue to build/reinforce itself. \n\nI'll amend my misinformed comment.

A second step after getting the dog comfortable could be walking to another room and back, that type of low-stakes separation. \n\nSince dogs don't have verbal reasoning skills or memory like humans, you have to find other ways of teaching the dog that separation is ok without pushing too hard and tying fear and separation together, making it harder for them to learn."]}
