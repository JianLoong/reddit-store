My parents recently left Sacramento for Danville, Indiana.  I have seen so much hate and bias towards the midwest for so long.  Don't understand it.  Thanks for welcoming us, and please know not everyone is so ignorant \u2764\u2b50", "Lol same Midwest born and raised my grandma eats some very aromatic foods. Including sauerkraut and other vinegar based foods. It just depends on your family really and what they like.", "Midwest here too...cultural sinkhole? That's a bunch of bull...I agree with your sentiment on this person's bias and given her lovely user name, she just might shove it somewhere else!", "One of my biggest pet peeves is people trashing other people/culture\u2019s foods.\n\nThe history of why cultures went the way they did in common foods is often very interesting and it\u2019s cool even how cultures will share things like a love of fried dough.\n\nHeck, Koreans love corn dogs, which you can imagine is a Midwestern/Americana staple, enough to put their own spin on things.", "The Midwest is a region, not a race. This is not racism.", "Exactly!", "It's obvious racism, what do you mean they won't deal with it? That behaviour isn't acceptable in a learning zone, or anywhere for that matter.", "Kimchi can have garlic, and there are a ton of variations, but I\u2019d say the smell is mostly fermented/spicy/fishy plus aromatics. It\u2019s a lot richer-smelling than sauerkraut, which to me smells fairly astringent.", "No just strong coffee grounds, no water added. seriously try it.   Didn\u2019t like blue cheese until I tried this combo.\n\nThere is such a thing as cheese in coffee, I do recall reading.  Can\u2019t remember what kind of cheese or which country it originated from.", "And here i was thinking i couldnt be any more self conscious", "Kimchi farts - a bitter-sweet path towards a healthy gut.", "Heck, since the teacher is grousing about OP's food being \"inappropriate,\" maybe she should send all the stinky Germanic & Scandihoovian foods--Sauerkraut, Liver & Onions, blood sausage, head cheese, limburger, pickled gizzards/ pickled pigsfeet, and pickled eggs!\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude08", "Speaking of aromatic, my dad's favorites, liverwurst and limburger cheese.", "I worked in a wonderful office of about 25 people with a lovely lunch room\u2026which 24 employees had to stop using when the 25th used it to enjoy her VERY aromatic lunches.  Daily.  I asked HR if there was anything we could do so that the rest of us could enjoy our lunches but alas we could not and ended up eating at our desks.  The employee knew but didn\u2019t care.  I understand OP, but frankly there must be something she can send that doesn\u2019t smell so pungent.", "Plus bleu cheese\u2026that really can be alot on the nose.", "Boy am I glad I\u2019m in California- kids love kimchi here", "Milwaukee has amazing diversity and it's still nothing compared to a lot of other midwestern cities! My nephew is oftentimes one of the pickiest eaters I've ever known but the boy will eat aloo gobi and any kind of curry, chorip\u00e1n, menudo, and a huge array of Vietnamese food, because he was introduced at a young age and it *gasp* tastes good!", "I hope not.  I have walked past the kitchen when they are cooking broccoli for 500. The smell can knock you over.", "There isn't, but as someone else below said, there is an unwritten rule at work about bringing smelly good (notably fish) and warming it up in the microwave near where everyone sits.\n\nMom is NTA btw. I sadly remember begging my mom to change the ethnic food she'd send us to school with (in elementary school) because of the bullying. Teacher support was lacking back then too. Eventually ended up with the same boring deli meat and cheese sandwiches, juice box and baggie of cookies that everyone else had.", "Because there are obviously many racist people unfortunately and it is just a guessing game if admin is also racist or not?", "This is hilarious and kind of cute. Your poor grandma lol. At least it turned out okay and they believed it was an accident.", "Kaffeost. It's a Swedish/Finnish thing.", "Ahh okay, got it! It\u2019s flavoring the cheese and you eat it like pudding I\u2019m assuming. For some reason I thought it was a drink. I\u2019ll try it! \n\nI\u2019ve had cheese foam in boba tea before. I did a hasty google and it looks like cheese in coffee happens in Scandinavia (Finland, Sweden) and Colombia! TIL.", "They just spelled it phonetically. As an American who happens to have Polish ancestry and lives in a densely Eastern European area, I can confirm that the Americanized spelling would be gwumpki or gawumpki. I've tried spelling it the correct way for people, but the \"l\" and the \"a\" and the \"b\" throw everyone off. You might as well try to make them read Cyrillic lol. Don't even get me started on the name, Piotr.", "Is there minnesotan port city besides Duluth?", "But so full of sugar and salt I can't eat it. Ymmv", "Where I grew up as a Taiwan immigrant!\n\nCan I also say I haven't found a paczki (no idea how to spell it) better than what I had growing up in Detroit?", "Can you please tell me more about the man with the shark on his leg?", "My high school occasionally served kimchi in the school cafeteria. It wasn't even bad kimchi. It's a relatively low cost (to make, kinda pricey if you buy it) ingredient that significantly boosts a meal's enjoyability.  \n\n\nA lot more people ate the cafeteria lunch on korean bbq day than meatloaf day, that's for sure. Even if the bbq was mostly fatty pork and chicken.  \n\n\nPublic school, in Hawaii, early 90s.  \n\n\nOh, yeah, also kimchi (and rice) when the lunch was beef stew. But that's a traditional (modern) Hawaiian combination.", "I agree that kimchi, sauerkraut etc don't smell 'bad'.  However, if you're not used to such things, they sure can smell 'different', and for an unfortunate sub-section of the population, that's basically the same thing :-(", "Usually... Of course, kids aren't perfect but kids generally start school at 5 and for the most part will not be messy... Also, a lot of effort is generally put in earlier. \n\nI don't know much about raising kids cause i don't have any but as far as i know, people start letting kids eat less messy food by themselves like fruits... \n\nOf course, Indian kids are messy as well, however people generally teach them to be clean before they are 5. We have to, cause we eat with our hands.", "Technically St Paul has a port, and so does Minneapolis...\n\nBut most of us as Minnesotans *do* usually tend to think of Duluth as having a port, *well* before the other two!", "Try North Carolina pulled pork barbecue sauce. It's a vinegar base with spices and very little sugar. I disliked it as a child, but as an adult, it's far more appetizing than the syrupy barbecue sauces.", "Just eat it dry then. Some of us just use rubs before smoking. And there are plenty of low and no sugar sauces in all types of palates.", "Try my favorite, Mustard based BBQ. Much less sugar.\n\nAlso always get the sauce on it on the side, so it can be done to taste.", "Cue the music- Baby Shark....Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo.\n\nYou're welcome!", "I would also like to know more about the shark, please.", "I\u2019ve yet to see an apartment where the vent hood actually vents", "So true - I mean I can smell everything people cook around me - I can tell if they\u2019re cooking sausages or a roast or curries or whatever - it\u2019s annoying because all my neighbours make delish smelling food and I\u2019m a terrible cook!", "Usually the stove vents work when they're first installed. But 2 things with that: they'll have filters that need to be changed and can easily be plugged up if it's never changed; and cook actually has to turn the fan on when cooking to push the bulk of the smell out before it permeates everywhere.", "THATS WHAT MY BRAIN SAID!", "ANd hard boiled eggs with Tuna ha ha ha", "I've never thought about sauerkraut+hummus, thanks for the inspiration!", "Vincenzo eats stinky meat!", "Kimchi and hummus is actually amazing. It's a real upgrade from sauerkraut."]}
