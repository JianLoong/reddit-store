However, I don't think it would be wrong to request the mother cut back on the kimchi and bleu cheese. \n\nI'm sure the teacher is dealing with every other 4-year-old in the room yelling \"EWWWWW\" as soon as they get a whiff of bleu cheese, lol. \n\nAnd everyone is saying the teacher is racist... Bleu cheese isn't a Korean food. It just smells really strongly. The teacher isn't saying \"don't bring Korean food.\" There's plenty of Korean food that wouldn't have a strong smell that permeates throughout the classroom.", "Lets just brush the casual racism and aggression aside then?", "I didn't even have to read the entire post to know this was going to be about a different cultures food preferences", "i thought i'd tried kimchi but clearly i haven't do you know any good ways of getting some in the uk?", "She doesn\u2019t care that it\u2019s Korean, she cares that it\u2019s stinky\u2026", "That\u2019s not racism. It\u2019s smelly food. End of story. If she was doing it specifically because of them being Korean, that would be racism. \nDon\u2019t use words unless you know how they are properly used.", "Stinky to her. With her cultural expectations about food.", "Goggle covert racism and get back with me"]}
