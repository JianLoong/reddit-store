These shows can be very aggressive. Lots of pushing, shoving, mosh pits, crowd surfers, I think you can understand the environment. My friend wanted to be in the front row so we paid for VIP packages that included early entry and we were first in line at the venue. We managed to secure our front row spots and we were enjoying ourselves until this happened\u2026 \n\nPeople started pushing and I was basically glued to my spot on the barricade. About midway through the second song I felt someone grabbing onto my shoulders and trying to pull me back. These things are to be expected at these types of shows so I ignored it. I turned around when I felt people tapping my shoulder and saw two women. One of them appeared to be out of breath. The woman goes \u201cPlease I can\u2019t breathe\u201d and so I yell loudly asking if she needs me to flag the security staff to pull her out. She says she\u2019s fine and she just needs to be in the front so she could breathe to which I told her there was no more room and I couldn\u2019t move. I turn around to enjoy the rest of the band\u2019s set when not even 5 minutes later her and her friend tap on my shoulders again asking me to let her take my spot. Again, I say there\u2019s no room to which her and her friend start screaming at me that the woman is pregnant and needs to be at the front so she could breathe. I got fed up because they were pulling my shoulders so hard so I told them \u201cWell then get out of the pit.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m the type of person at shows to help the people around me out when they need it. The biggest rule at metal shows is to pick someone up when you see them fall and I always help with that one. But I didn\u2019t want to give up the spot my friend and I waited hours for. The other reason was why the hell would you go into the front-center of a deathcore crowd knowing you\u2019re pregnant? There were seating options available or she could\u2019ve stayed to the sides to avoid getting pushed around to that extent. \n\nThe people around me also started telling her to get out of the pit and even the security guy in front of me asking me what was going on had a \u201cwtf\u201d face when I told him. I talked about this on twitter later that night to which people called me the asshole for not giving up my spot when everyone at the show around me agreed that she was faking it just trying to get a front row spot since she was refusing help and insisting someone give up their front row spot for her. AITA?\n\nEDIT: i just remembered this part. after like the 3rd time she asked and i offered to get her out she said \u201cno it\u2019s okay i\u2019m just short\u201d so i think she might\u2019ve been lying just to get a front row spot. regardless, she was being ridiculous imo.", "created_utc": 1677772317, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g634r/aita_for_not_letting_a_pregnant_woman_in_front_of/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She 100% should not have been at that mosh pit let alone the front row. Even without being pregnant I get claustrophobic and can't do it any more and it's much better hanging towards the back where I'm not being shoved. I get she didn't want to get security involved, but she doesn't get to steal your front row spot either. Maybe she was caught off guard and didn't realize it and you could have been nice and given up your spot but she still would have been getting shoved against the railing which doesn't seem healthy either.", "NTA.\n\nPregnant people can\u2019t do everything, there\u2019s restrictions. She needs to get over it. The fact that she was even there in the first place is alarming.", "NTA. You offered her assistance.\n\nAs someone that's been pregnant at a show like that (Ozzy and Rob Zombie), SHE is the idiot here. \n\nI had JUST found out a few days before the aforementioned concert that I was pregnant. The facility surprisingly and happily did not allow mosh pits (fka Joe Louis Arena) and security was very tight when it came to that... so us being on main floor did not have an affect on me. \n\nHowever, my friend and I were prepared to exchange tickets with other people in the stands if necessary. I was NOT about to be in a pit after just finding out I was pregnant!!!", "NTA either she was faking it or she was really pregnant and shouldn\u2019t be there in the first place.

I think it\u2019s fine to go to a show as long as you know your limits and stay well out of the pit/on the perimeter or in a seat. I\u2019m pregnant and plan on going to a couple of metal shows in the next few months (Periphery and Trivium), but my husband and I are either going to get seats on the balcony or stay on the outskirts of the standing area where there\u2019s much more room.", "NTA. You, other patrons and security were all available to help her leave the pit. Her pregnancy doesn't entitle her to your front row position.", "NTA.\n\nYou gave her good advice - get out of the pit.", "NTA - she is the AH for being there. Those types of scenarios are a good way to get a placental abruption which is *extremely* dangerous for mom and baby. Being short of breath would be the least of her problems.\n\nShe has the rest of her life to go to a metal concert - she can't give it up for 40 weeks? Pregnancy and parenting require sacrifices.\n\nSounds to me like she just wanted to be in the front. If she were truly in distress, she would have accepted help.", "NTA, if she was that concerned for her well being she shouldn\u2019t have been there and if there was truly a risk, she should have agreed to allow security to get her out of there.

But if she was actually pregnant (and it could have just been a trick to guilt you), then she either needed to avoid the pit or have security pull her out if it was an emergency.
