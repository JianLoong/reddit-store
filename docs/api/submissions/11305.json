These shows can be very aggressive. Lots of pushing, shoving, mosh pits, crowd surfers, I think you can understand the environment. My friend wanted to be in the front row so we paid for VIP packages that included early entry and we were first in line at the venue. We managed to secure our front row spots and we were enjoying ourselves until this happened\u2026 \n\nPeople started pushing and I was basically glued to my spot on the barricade. About midway through the second song I felt someone grabbing onto my shoulders and trying to pull me back. These things are to be expected at these types of shows so I ignored it. I turned around when I felt people tapping my shoulder and saw two women. One of them appeared to be out of breath. The woman goes \u201cPlease I can\u2019t breathe\u201d and so I yell loudly asking if she needs me to flag the security staff to pull her out. She says she\u2019s fine and she just needs to be in the front so she could breathe to which I told her there was no more room and I couldn\u2019t move. I turn around to enjoy the rest of the band\u2019s set when not even 5 minutes later her and her friend tap on my shoulders again asking me to let her take my spot. Again, I say there\u2019s no room to which her and her friend start screaming at me that the woman is pregnant and needs to be at the front so she could breathe. I got fed up because they were pulling my shoulders so hard so I told them \u201cWell then get out of the pit.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m the type of person at shows to help the people around me out when they need it. The biggest rule at metal shows is to pick someone up when you see them fall and I always help with that one. But I didn\u2019t want to give up the spot my friend and I waited hours for. The other reason was why the hell would you go into the front-center of a deathcore crowd knowing you\u2019re pregnant? There were seating options available or she could\u2019ve stayed to the sides to avoid getting pushed around to that extent. \n\nThe people around me also started telling her to get out of the pit and even the security guy in front of me asking me what was going on had a \u201cwtf\u201d face when I told him. I talked about this on twitter later that night to which people called me the asshole for not giving up my spot when everyone at the show around me agreed that she was faking it just trying to get a front row spot since she was refusing help and insisting someone give up their front row spot for her. AITA?\n\nEDIT: i just remembered this part. after like the 3rd time she asked and i offered to get her out she said \u201cno it\u2019s okay i\u2019m just short\u201d so i think she might\u2019ve been lying just to get a front row spot. regardless, she was being ridiculous imo.", "created_utc": 1677772317, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g634r/aita_for_not_letting_a_pregnant_woman_in_front_of/", "score": 625, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
