My husband (29M)  and I (30F) have been married 6 years, together 12. We met through a mutual friend our last year in high school and bonded over nerdy stuff, did long distance while I did my bachelor's degree for 4 years. \n\nI am the oldest of 6 children.  Money was always a bit tight, but manageable. My dad was army, and put out on disability for a severe training accident after baby number 4. Baby number 5 came due not long after my dad was put out due to a birth control issue (it's not 100% unfortunately). When baby number 5 was around 2, my dad got a second opinion from a civilian doctor and was allowed to come back into the military. Not long after that, baby number 6 (cause my dad wanted a 2nd boy). I was 11, and had dealt with food stamps, my mom having breakdowns from financial stress, and ended up with ptsd and depression myself from the childhood trauma.\n\nMy husband was the youngest of 5. His parents had their first 4, then when the second youngest was 12, decided they didn't want to be empty nesters yet and had my husband. When the other 4 were little, they struggled financially, but by the time my husband was born, his dad had worked for NASA for over 2 decades, so they had social security and a high salary. They went out every weekend, and he would get fast food every couple days, while my family only could afford to go out for birthdays. \n\nMy husband didn't make me aware this was how often they went out until the last couple years. I've had to tighten our budget and restrict how often we eat out, and my husband had a legit panic attack over it. \n\nI make around 600 more than he does a month,  not including the OT that I work, and I do all the household chores except his laundry. Last night I was really tired and didn't feel like cooking or doing a ton of dishes and asked if he would be ok with a PBJ sandwich or can of soup from the pantry to use up what we had.  He got really offended and asked are we so bad off that we have to resort to poor people meals? \n\nI didn't think there was anything wrong with canned soup and crackers or PBJ, it's what I grew up with and it's food, and thought it would help decrease our debt to use what we had, but maybe I'm wrong? Am I TAH?\n\nWhy I might be TAH: Wasn't considerate of my husband's depression and wasn't willing to try making actual food.\n\nEdit 1:I forgot to add this to the post last night (was very tired when I wrote this, my apologies). When we first got married, he did help with household chores more and didn't complain as much about things. He can't cook, but he would at least make easy things like chili dogs or sandwiches for us. His depression hit 2-3 years ago and it was a puppet with cut strings. That's when the issues started. We do also both work 40 hrs a week, but I make more an hour and do more OT, just to clear up any confusion from how I worded it earlier.", "created_utc": 1698638806, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17jl0xt/aita_making_hubby_eat_poor_people_meals/", "score": 527, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Please stop doing everything for him, though.", "You are being played like a fiddle", "He's been an adult for over a decade. His childhood is irrelevant. If you did not learn to cook as a child, you definitely would have learned by now. There's absolutely no excuse for a grown man to not cook. It's all just misogyny. \n\nSo for such a misogynistic man, he's got a lot of nerve earning less than you yet still prance around like he's your boss.", "I\u2019m kinda wondering why you married someone who does absolutely zero housework.", "Everyone with at least one Hand and a brain can learn how to cook basic stuff", "He is an adult, he can learn.  Stop coddling him.\n\nI never cooked as a child, but I learned.", "He can't cook because he can't be bothered to learn.", "He's a grown man with internet access, he can learn how to cook.", "If he knows how to find the website YouTube then he can learn how to cook rather quickly.", "He can learn, eat 'poor people' meals, or starve. His choice.", "MIL? This man is almost 30 years old!", "Then he may not be on the right ones. My husband went through 3 or 4 different combos over the course of about a year to find a combination of medications that work for him. Is your husband seeing a psychiatrist? A general practitioner isn't going to cut it here.", "Aw babe! You are being such a loving and compassionate partner, and who is taking care of YOU?? I bet it feels normal to have to do way too much around the house after your upbringing, but you must know that it isn't. \n\nYou deserve a partner who carries their own weight AND helps you with your weight when you need it, just like you help with theirs.\n\nIn the immediate term, I think this whole situation is conclusive proof that shouldering your husband's half has not helped his depression and HAS hurt you and your marriage, so I'd recommend going back to halfsies while you figure out what to do next.\n\nAnd for what it's worth: both my partner and I have battled depression over the course of 15+ years of marriage. The times we have come closest to ending things have been when one of us took on too much for too long and then snapped. Being a martyr is not good for a relationship! So even if it feels mean to assert yourself, I'm here to tell you it's best for you both.", "Hmmm seems like you know what he expects of you. You just don\u2019t like it \ud83d\ude02. My gf is the same way \ud83d\ude06", "This right here. We have chores that are ours and deadlines for them. - works!", "He should learn to cook and actually cook. Op doesn't say they didn't have ingredients in the house she just suggested stuff that didn't need cooking.\n\nNTA op but kick his butt in gear to do half the chores and split kitchen duty. You aren't his mother", "Thank you, I'll have to see if I can find a copy of that book", "I realize I need to go back and make an edit, I've been trying to respond to individual comments where I can but I forgot to add this to the post last night (was half asleep). When we first got married, he did help with household chores more and didn't complain as much about things. His depression hit 2-3 years ago and it was a puppet with cut strings. He just stopped being himself.", "This is gold. Thanks for the laugh.", "you\u2019re making me hungry!! do you make your own sourdough? I keep hearing that unless you live in California your sourdough from stores isn\u2019t gonna be that great.", "I reccomend brie grilled cheese too.  Fantastic", "Reading this I'm wondering if at least part of the reason for the depression is low self-esteem/self-worth, feeling \"less than\". Instead of being humble about it and simply learning \"adulting\" skills late it's coming out as anger, panic, and whatever else.\n\nNTA\n\nDH might acc benefit from having more responsibilities. Though I'd expect resistance.", "Totally agree with this. He is making enough excuses for himself to need OP also making them for him. Enough with the depression, the meeting the expectations of his childhood, the salary insecurity, the can't cook card. This man is a misogynist who inherently believes it is a women's job to do all domestic labour while thinking his contribution of having a penis means you should surely be thrilled to serve him, despite you having a busier and probably more stressful job. OP, I'm seeinga lot of your comments show awareness of and concern for him, I think you need to seriously address this and make him understand it cannot go on, unless you want to spend a lifetime as his doormat.", "Why is it his Mums and not his Dad's laziness? It not the sole responsibility of a mother to raise her children, can we please raise the bar of expectations of fathers here please. Agree totally though that none of that is any credible excuse for him not learning how to cook.", "Thank you, I appreciate the comment", "Once it works and works well, we do bribes or trades.  For some reason, my partner HATES taking out the trash.  He's absolutely equal about everything, but he makes a five minute chore into some sort of Shakespearean tragedy that he might not live through.  While hilarious and I enjoy the pathos and drama leading up to taking out the trash, I took that on. haha  I hate cleaning off the snow from my car and parking spot and bribe him with baked goods that are homemade.  He cleans off my car and shovels my spot out and there are homemade cookies.", "You can often download it as a free pdf if you google for it.\n\nI hope it gets better for you.", "Right so therapy is needed. A revisal of his meds are maybe needed and he needs to actively try to work on his mental health issues and his overburdening of someone he is supposed to care for.  all coming from someone who has battled depression among other conditions for a long long time. \n\nYou are entitled to ask for more and if more is not given to leave. Do not do this to yourself over the idea of love and society\u2019s potential judgement that you left someone with depression. You are entitled to take care of yourself. You are allowed that. \n\nOh couples therapy and individual therapy for yourself if you can swing both. For yourself if only one.", "And is he in therapy? Is he working on addressing his mental health? \n\nBecause if he isn't, it isn't *your* job to drag him along.", "Is he in treatment at all for this or does he just expect you to take care of it? I have severe depression. I\u2019ve been in and out of treatment and on and off of meds since I was 11. I have days/weeks where I can\u2019t get out of bed. You can\u2019t just stop living for multiple YEARS and expect someone to pick up the pieces.", "Is he getting treatment? My husband has depression, totl the point that he was briefly hospitalized, but after finding the right medication for him he is doing a lot better. But, even when he was at his worst, he did not expect ne to do everything for him.", "oh good grief no. i could never make bread. i just buy fresh loaves from my grocery store. they actually do a pretty decent job of it.", "oh i love to bake brie with drizzled honey & slivered almonds & eat it with cantaloupe & honeydew. so freaking good! never thought to use it in grilled cheese...sounds good!", "I\u2019ll have to try it :)"]}
