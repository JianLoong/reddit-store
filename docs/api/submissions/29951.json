{"id": 29951, "submission_id": "17jl0xt", "title": "AITA making hubby eat poor people meals?", "selftext": "So a bit of background to start off. My husband (29M)  and I (30F) have been married 6 years, together 12. We met through a mutual friend our last year in high school and bonded over nerdy stuff, did long distance while I did my bachelor's degree for 4 years. \n\nI am the oldest of 6 children.  Money was always a bit tight, but manageable. My dad was army, and put out on disability for a severe training accident after baby number 4. Baby number 5 came due not long after my dad was put out due to a birth control issue (it's not 100% unfortunately). When baby number 5 was around 2, my dad got a second opinion from a civilian doctor and was allowed to come back into the military. Not long after that, baby number 6 (cause my dad wanted a 2nd boy). I was 11, and had dealt with food stamps, my mom having breakdowns from financial stress, and ended up with ptsd and depression myself from the childhood trauma.\n\nMy husband was the youngest of 5. His parents had their first 4, then when the second youngest was 12, decided they didn't want to be empty nesters yet and had my husband. When the other 4 were little, they struggled financially, but by the time my husband was born, his dad had worked for NASA for over 2 decades, so they had social security and a high salary. They went out every weekend, and he would get fast food every couple days, while my family only could afford to go out for birthdays. \n\nMy husband didn't make me aware this was how often they went out until the last couple years. I've had to tighten our budget and restrict how often we eat out, and my husband had a legit panic attack over it. \n\nI make around 600 more than he does a month,  not including the OT that I work, and I do all the household chores except his laundry. Last night I was really tired and didn't feel like cooking or doing a ton of dishes and asked if he would be ok with a PBJ sandwich or can of soup from the pantry to use up what we had.  He got really offended and asked are we so bad off that we have to resort to poor people meals? \n\nI didn't think there was anything wrong with canned soup and crackers or PBJ, it's what I grew up with and it's food, and thought it would help decrease our debt to use what we had, but maybe I'm wrong? Am I TAH?\n\nWhy I might be TAH: Wasn't considerate of my husband's depression and wasn't willing to try making actual food.\n\nEdit 1:I forgot to add this to the post last night (was very tired when I wrote this, my apologies). When we first got married, he did help with household chores more and didn't complain as much about things. He can't cook, but he would at least make easy things like chili dogs or sandwiches for us. His depression hit 2-3 years ago and it was a puppet with cut strings. That's when the issues started. We do also both work 40 hrs a week, but I make more an hour and do more OT, just to clear up any confusion from how I worded it earlier.\n\nEdit 2: Since a lot of people have asked, I figured it may be easier to address en masse, yes my husband is on medication for his depression, and is willing to try therapy, but unfortunately the wait lists in our area for a therapist are months long.

Most depressed people don't expect to be waited on hand and foot, especially if their partner is tired.
