My husband (29M)  and I (30F) have been married 6 years, together 12. We met through a mutual friend our last year in high school and bonded over nerdy stuff, did long distance while I did my bachelor's degree for 4 years. \n\nI am the oldest of 6 children.  Money was always a bit tight, but manageable. My dad was army, and put out on disability for a severe training accident after baby number 4. Baby number 5 came due not long after my dad was put out due to a birth control issue (it's not 100% unfortunately). When baby number 5 was around 2, my dad got a second opinion from a civilian doctor and was allowed to come back into the military. Not long after that, baby number 6 (cause my dad wanted a 2nd boy). I was 11, and had dealt with food stamps, my mom having breakdowns from financial stress, and ended up with ptsd and depression myself from the childhood trauma.\n\nMy husband was the youngest of 5. His parents had their first 4, then when the second youngest was 12, decided they didn't want to be empty nesters yet and had my husband. When the other 4 were little, they struggled financially, but by the time my husband was born, his dad had worked for NASA for over 2 decades, so they had social security and a high salary. They went out every weekend, and he would get fast food every couple days, while my family only could afford to go out for birthdays. \n\nMy husband didn't make me aware this was how often they went out until the last couple years. I've had to tighten our budget and restrict how often we eat out, and my husband had a legit panic attack over it. \n\nI make around 600 more than he does a month,  not including the OT that I work, and I do all the household chores except his laundry. Last night I was really tired and didn't feel like cooking or doing a ton of dishes and asked if he would be ok with a PBJ sandwich or can of soup from the pantry to use up what we had.  He got really offended and asked are we so bad off that we have to resort to poor people meals? \n\nI didn't think there was anything wrong with canned soup and crackers or PBJ, it's what I grew up with and it's food, and thought it would help decrease our debt to use what we had, but maybe I'm wrong? Am I TAH?\n\nWhy I might be TAH: Wasn't considerate of my husband's depression and wasn't willing to try making actual food.", "created_utc": 1698638806, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17jl0xt/aita_making_hubby_eat_poor_people_meals/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My God, I love a good PB&J every now and then. Ditto on the soup and crackers. Throw in a grilled cheese sandwich somewhere and I'm about as happy as one can get. We weren't poor growing up, but my mother was the product of her upbringing, very budget conscious when it came to planning and making meals.

He will survive with \"poor people meals.\" If he doesn't like it he can cook. Honestly it sounds like he should be doing more.  Is he being treated for depression? If he's not he should discuss options with his doctor and/or research his options.", "This seems to be more about household responsibilities than budget. Its one thing to not afford high quality ingredients, but assuming you had them, it doesnt sound as though he is capable of cooking a meal.

Or peanut butter, banana, cinnamon, and honey sandwiches. So fucking good. Most of the best foods are \"poor people\" cuisine. And it's not like, based on your post, you two are having it every day and he's sick of it, right? You cook, clean, and work more. Sometimes you gotta take a day off or two. If he doesn't want that, he can make his own damn food at that point. Or cook for the both of you. I get being depressed can make it hard to do things. Damn, do I get it.

You are that bad off, if he wants to put it that way. He is free to fix other food if he wants to, he is not paralyzed from the neck down.", "NTA This isn't even about money. You both work and you do 95 percent if the housework. That's problem number one. Number two is your husband is a grown adult who can cook his own damn dinner if he doesn't like peanut butter sandwiches.", "NTA; a grown man can make his own food if he doesn't like what you offer.", "NTA. I would definitely have considered PB&J or canned soup an awesome dinner during parts of my childhood.  Because food is better than no food.

Depressed people get the same nutrition from a sandwich or soup as non-depressed people. Most depressed people would be happy to be given a sandwich or soup if their partner was tired (or more likely they would offer to make it themselves!). Most depressed people don't expect to be waited on hand and foot, especially if their partner is tired. Most depressed people don't criticise what their partner offers to cook. \n\nIt sounds like he uses his depression as a cover for being selfish and lazy.

Each of you has tasks and you start only doing yours (unless it hurts the kitties, of course).  But if it's his night to cook dinner and there is nothing, you have your own stash of a quick meal and he's on his own.", "As someone who has been dealing with depression for 10 years he's going to develop coping mechanisms and tools.  Medication can be helpful but it's not always enough.  Routine, exercise, and counseling have been what helped me.
