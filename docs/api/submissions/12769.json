I (24f) and my boyfriend (24m), like most people, appreciate a good bubble tea.  A week ago, we went out and grabbed lunch & teas at a bubble tea place in our town.  The restaurant is not a full-service restaurant, but is one of those places where you order at the front and they yell out your number when it's ready.  I always thought the rule was that you tip in sit-down restaurants where you are being served, but not in places where you grab something at the counter (unless you leave a little change for a tip jar).  In sit-down restaurants, I'm a stickler for always tipping at least 20%.\n\nSo we ordered and the woman behind the register told us the total - about $35 for two meals & drinks (a bit of a special splurge for us student-loanees).  I put my credit card into the card reader, and then took my hands off and waited for the usual directions to pop up - again, without touching the screen.  They came up, as usual - 15%, 20%, 22%, 25%.  But then, before I could click \"skip\" - or touch the machine at all - the button for 20% lit up orange, and automatically charged me a $7 service tip.  The woman at the register immediately printed and handed me the receipt for $42.  Flustered and in the heat of the moment, I awkwardly explained that the price was wrong, that I hadn't selected the tip and that the machine had randomly added it on.  The woman behind the register looked at me with a blank stare and said, \"So do you want to take off the tip?\"  I said yes please.  The woman had to call over a manager, who also gave me a blank stare and confirmed that I wanted a refund for my tip.  As they were printing off a special receipt in silence, I wanted to melt into a puddle on the floor.  The manager handed me the tip refund receipt without saying anything, and I said an awkward \"thanks\" before scurrying off to the side to wait for the food.\n\nAs we waited, my boyfriend made a joke about hoping the staff didn't spit in my food after what just happened.  I asked him if what I'd done was horribly awkward, and he said, \"Well... yeah.  I wouldn't have asked for the tip back.\"  I told my family about what I did, and my dad disagreed.  He said the card reader was clearly broken or rigged, and wondered if the rigging could have been intentional.  My mom thinks that's unlikely.  My sister said that next time, \"you should just pay the $7, it's not worth it.\"  Honestly, I agree with my sister - at this point, I'd absolutely pay the extra $7 just to avoid that incredibly awkward situation.  But I have to ask: Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1679336559, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11wqs4m/aita_for_asking_for_a_tip_back_at_a_restaurant/", "score": 175, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It might have been very rude to take money right out of the hands of low-paid service workers who need it after technically paying them, even if I wasn't in control of the payment.

You are not obligated to pay a tip which is why there are options at the bottom. \n\nPersonally I\u2019d write a yelp review about this because if other people are also experiencing the same thing and not asking for their money because it\u2019s \u2018embarrassing/not worth it\u2019 then this place is stealing a lot of money. But if it was a glitch then they can tell you the fixed the issue. Sounds really shady what happened though.", "NTA - They weren't surprised it added your tip automatically, they were surprised you called out their bullshit.  Have a friend go in there and see if it happens to them too and if it does call the police, that's called theft.\n\nAs a general rule I'll tip a dollar per drink at Starbucks, $2 if it's a complicated (GF) drink. 20% is only for restaurants, sit down restaurants.", "NTA. Charging you things without your agreement is called stealing.", "NTA. Sounds like the cashier picked the tip for you which would be fraud or the system is glitching. Either one isn't the price you agreed to pay and no one should be shaming you for trying to get THEIR error fixed. I'm a former server and I still tip at places that aren't full service but I don't tip 20%+ on self serve sort of counters where they just take your order and call out your name with it's ready (like Panera bread etc) and there's no service after that- that sort of setup should be reflected in the wage not the customer tips.  I'm also an introvert so that whole situation would be uncomfortable but I'd be pissed if they tried to steal money from me. Bet they were counting on the whole awkwardness to get extra unwarranted tips from customers who were afraid to say anything.", "NTA. I would\u2019ve wanted the tip back purely for the reason that it was forced. I can\u2019t say whether or not this was intentional by the restaurant, but I\u2019d be upset that the computer was forcing me to tip. I get that it\u2019s a bit awkward to ask them to refund it, but you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "NTA! Awkward for sure. More than likely either the machine has been intentionally rigged or the cashier chose the tip. Both are wrong.", "NTA.  That bubble tea place is a horrible asshole.  There's no way that was an accident. They should have apologized to you. You should leave a review and note what happened; I'd want to know as a potential customer who loves bubble tea.", "NTA and the manager didn\u2019t take what happened seriously enough. If the reader was set up to do that automatically without any posted notice, that\u2019s potentially illegal. \n\nIf the machine was genuinely malfunctioning, the manager should have said so and apologized for the inconvenience. \n\nEither way, you were not at fault. If you had not said something, the next person who noticed the tip automatically being added probably would have. \n\nTipping is voluntary and it is reasonable to expect the system a restaurant is using to allow you to select the amount or opt out.", "NTA and what a fraudulent system they have.

It actually starts at 20% and goes up to 30% unless you hit other and manually type in what you\u2019d prefer. \n\nNext time, be prepared to have cash on hand - even if it\u2019s just $5. You can save the awkwardness and say, I prefer to tip in cash. \n\nMost owners understand because they get charged a merchant fee per transaction as well.", "NTA.

This on screen tipping thing is a newer thing within the last handful of years.  I never used to see it. Now I see it everywhere.  And for things I wouldn't usually tip for.  Subway is one that I've encountered a few times.\n\nWith this newer method, I feel pressured to add a tip now.  Rather than paying employees decent wages, companies are pushing that cost on the consumer; which is fucked.\n\nWhat the bubble tea place did was theft.  No tip should be automated figured into a purchase unless it's one of those parties of 6 of more on a big dinner.  \n\nAnd the fact that the manager didn't say anything is on them.  If he were in your position, I wonder what he would have done?", "NTA but a bit short sighted if you go there often. \n\nPay in cash next time and leave appropriate tip.", "Nah a lot of older people have trouble with the machines.

Because the owner is offsetting their labor costs with your tips. The only reason your order isn't more expensive is because they're expecting you to subsidize their employees' wages.\n\nIs the system garbage? Yes. Would your food be more expensive if the system were different? Also yes.\n\nAnd for any of those \"I reject tipping culture\" people: Yeah, it's awful, but you're not changing the culture by not tipping, you're just passing the hit on to the person making $2.13/hr", "Disclaimer: I waited tables for 10 years.\nI\u2019m gonna disagree with the group, YTA.
