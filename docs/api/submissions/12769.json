I (24f) and my boyfriend (24m), like most people, appreciate a good bubble tea.  A week ago, we went out and grabbed lunch & teas at a bubble tea place in our town.  The restaurant is not a full-service restaurant, but is one of those places where you order at the front and they yell out your number when it's ready.  I always thought the rule was that you tip in sit-down restaurants where you are being served, but not in places where you grab something at the counter (unless you leave a little change for a tip jar).  In sit-down restaurants, I'm a stickler for always tipping at least 20%.\n\nSo we ordered and the woman behind the register told us the total - about $35 for two meals & drinks (a bit of a special splurge for us student-loanees).  I put my credit card into the card reader, and then took my hands off and waited for the usual directions to pop up - again, without touching the screen.  They came up, as usual - 15%, 20%, 22%, 25%.  But then, before I could click \"skip\" - or touch the machine at all - the button for 20% lit up orange, and automatically charged me a $7 service tip.  The woman at the register immediately printed and handed me the receipt for $42.  Flustered and in the heat of the moment, I awkwardly explained that the price was wrong, that I hadn't selected the tip and that the machine had randomly added it on.  The woman behind the register looked at me with a blank stare and said, \"So do you want to take off the tip?\"  I said yes please.  The woman had to call over a manager, who also gave me a blank stare and confirmed that I wanted a refund for my tip.  As they were printing off a special receipt in silence, I wanted to melt into a puddle on the floor.  The manager handed me the tip refund receipt without saying anything, and I said an awkward \"thanks\" before scurrying off to the side to wait for the food.\n\nAs we waited, my boyfriend made a joke about hoping the staff didn't spit in my food after what just happened.  I asked him if what I'd done was horribly awkward, and he said, \"Well... yeah.  I wouldn't have asked for the tip back.\"  I told my family about what I did, and my dad disagreed.  He said the card reader was clearly broken or rigged, and wondered if the rigging could have been intentional.  My mom thinks that's unlikely.  My sister said that next time, \"you should just pay the $7, it's not worth it.\"  Honestly, I agree with my sister - at this point, I'd absolutely pay the extra $7 just to avoid that incredibly awkward situation.  But I have to ask: Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1679336559, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11wqs4m/aita_for_asking_for_a_tip_back_at_a_restaurant/", "score": 783, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are not obligated to pay a tip which is why there are options at the bottom. \n\nPersonally I\u2019d write a yelp review about this because if other people are also experiencing the same thing and not asking for their money because it\u2019s \u2018embarrassing/not worth it\u2019 then this place is stealing a lot of money. But if it was a glitch then they can tell you the fixed the issue. Sounds really shady what happened though.", "NTA - They weren't surprised it added your tip automatically, they were surprised you called out their bullshit.  Have a friend go in there and see if it happens to them too and if it does call the police, that's called theft.\n\nAs a general rule I'll tip a dollar per drink at Starbucks, $2 if it's a complicated (GF) drink. 20% is only for restaurants, sit down restaurants.", "NTA. Charging you things without your agreement is called stealing.", "NTA. Sounds like the cashier picked the tip for you which would be fraud or the system is glitching. Either one isn't the price you agreed to pay and no one should be shaming you for trying to get THEIR error fixed. I'm a former server and I still tip at places that aren't full service but I don't tip 20%+ on self serve sort of counters where they just take your order and call out your name with it's ready (like Panera bread etc) and there's no service after that- that sort of setup should be reflected in the wage not the customer tips.  I'm also an introvert so that whole situation would be uncomfortable but I'd be pissed if they tried to steal money from me. Bet they were counting on the whole awkwardness to get extra unwarranted tips from customers who were afraid to say anything.", "NTA. I would\u2019ve wanted the tip back purely for the reason that it was forced. I can\u2019t say whether or not this was intentional by the restaurant, but I\u2019d be upset that the computer was forcing me to tip.

Rather than paying employees decent wages, companies are pushing that cost on the consumer; which is fucked.\n\nWhat the bubble tea place did was theft.  No tip should be automated figured into a purchase unless it's one of those parties of 6 of more on a big dinner.  \n\nAnd the fact that the manager didn't say anything is on them.

Because the owner is offsetting their labor costs with your tips.

It's funny that manager is like \"oh, you dont Support our people, pay us more because we dont pay our employees too much\"", "NTA because obviously it's completely up to you whether or not to tip. It all worked out, sounds like. I do think it's reasonable to tip if you've ordered drinks - like any service, the tip is for the preparation and cleanup - although a lesser amount than the standard 20 percent, unless you can afford to be generous. Since you got meals and drinks, and you sat at a table there that would need to be cleaned, some kind of gratuity would have been appropriate but not obligatory. But that's all to say, you shouldn't feel bad or awkward adjusting your total, and I think you probably did feel bad for the misunderstanding and that set the tone.\n\nAnd despite everyone being sure you were part of some scam, I'd doubt it. Is it possible someone was relying on you not protesting a 20 percent tip? For sure. And I won't say it hasn't happened and won't happen at times. But most workers know that's not something they can get away with without being called out on it regularly by customers, and managers are equally not likely to sign onto a scheme like that because they don't benefit from those paltry tips. Most restaurant theft happens with physical objects: copying your card information when it's taken away from the table, stealing tips from other servers because it can't be traced like the money in the drawer or from the card can be. The more reasonable (and super common) explanation is someone touched something by accident and assumed the other person touched it, and it got missed rushing you through. The blank faces are very easily explained as the service favorite: \"then why did you ask for the thing / press the button\" (even if you didn't and she did, lol). It's awkward, and annoying, but I don't think you need to look any deeper than that unless you get a repeat performance.", "NTA.
