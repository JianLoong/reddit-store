I (24f) and my boyfriend (24m), like most people, appreciate a good bubble tea.  A week ago, we went out and grabbed lunch & teas at a bubble tea place in our town.  The restaurant is not a full-service restaurant, but is one of those places where you order at the front and they yell out your number when it's ready.  I always thought the rule was that you tip in sit-down restaurants where you are being served, but not in places where you grab something at the counter (unless you leave a little change for a tip jar).  In sit-down restaurants, I'm a stickler for always tipping at least 20%.\n\nSo we ordered and the woman behind the register told us the total - about $35 for two meals & drinks (a bit of a special splurge for us student-loanees).  I put my credit card into the card reader, and then took my hands off and waited for the usual directions to pop up - again, without touching the screen.  They came up, as usual - 15%, 20%, 22%, 25%.  But then, before I could click \"skip\" - or touch the machine at all - the button for 20% lit up orange, and automatically charged me a $7 service tip.  The woman at the register immediately printed and handed me the receipt for $42.  Flustered and in the heat of the moment, I awkwardly explained that the price was wrong, that I hadn't selected the tip and that the machine had randomly added it on.  The woman behind the register looked at me with a blank stare and said, \"So do you want to take off the tip?\"  I said yes please.  The woman had to call over a manager, who also gave me a blank stare and confirmed that I wanted a refund for my tip.  As they were printing off a special receipt in silence, I wanted to melt into a puddle on the floor.  The manager handed me the tip refund receipt without saying anything, and I said an awkward \"thanks\" before scurrying off to the side to wait for the food.\n\nAs we waited, my boyfriend made a joke about hoping the staff didn't spit in my food after what just happened.  I asked him if what I'd done was horribly awkward, and he said, \"Well... yeah.  I wouldn't have asked for the tip back.\"  I told my family about what I did, and my dad disagreed.  He said the card reader was clearly broken or rigged, and wondered if the rigging could have been intentional.  My mom thinks that's unlikely.  My sister said that next time, \"you should just pay the $7, it's not worth it.\"  Honestly, I agree with my sister - at this point, I'd absolutely pay the extra $7 just to avoid that incredibly awkward situation.  But I have to ask: Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1679336559, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11wqs4m/aita_for_asking_for_a_tip_back_at_a_restaurant/", "score": 307, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are not obligated to pay a tip which is why there are options at the bottom. \n\nPersonally I\u2019d write a yelp review about this because if other people are also experiencing the same thing and not asking for their money because it\u2019s \u2018embarrassing/not worth it\u2019 then this place is stealing a lot of money. But if it was a glitch then they can tell you the fixed the issue.

Have a friend go in there and see if it happens to them too and if it does call the police, that's called theft.\n\nAs a general rule I'll tip a dollar per drink at Starbucks, $2 if it's a complicated (GF) drink. 20% is only for restaurants, sit down restaurants.", "NTA. Charging you things without your agreement is called stealing.", "NTA. Sounds like the cashier picked the tip for you which would be fraud or the system is glitching. Either one isn't the price you agreed to pay and no one should be shaming you for trying to get THEIR error fixed. I'm a former server and I still tip at places that aren't full service but I don't tip 20%+ on self serve sort of counters where they just take your order and call out your name with it's ready (like Panera bread etc) and there's no service after that- that sort of setup should be reflected in the wage not the customer tips.  I'm also an introvert so that whole situation would be uncomfortable but I'd be pissed if they tried to steal money from me. Bet they were counting on the whole awkwardness to get extra unwarranted tips from customers who were afraid to say anything.", "NTA. I would\u2019ve wanted the tip back purely for the reason that it was forced.

Rather than paying employees decent wages, companies are pushing that cost on the consumer; which is fucked.\n\nWhat the bubble tea place did was theft.  No tip should be automated figured into a purchase unless it's one of those parties of 6 of more on a big dinner.  \n\nAnd the fact that the manager didn't say anything is on them.

Because the owner is offsetting their labor costs with your tips.

It's funny that manager is like \"oh, you dont Support our people, pay us more because we dont pay our employees too much\"", "NTA because obviously it's completely up to you whether or not to tip. It all worked out, sounds like. I do think it's reasonable to tip if you've ordered drinks - like any service, the tip is for the preparation and cleanup - although a lesser amount than the standard 20 percent, unless you can afford to be generous. Since you got meals and drinks, and you sat at a table there that would need to be cleaned, some kind of gratuity would have been appropriate but not obligatory. But that's all to say, you shouldn't feel bad or awkward adjusting your total, and I think you probably did feel bad for the misunderstanding and that set the tone.\n\nAnd despite everyone being sure you were part of some scam, I'd doubt it. Is it possible someone was relying on you not protesting a 20 percent tip? For sure. And I won't say it hasn't happened and won't happen at times. But most workers know that's not something they can get away with without being called out on it regularly by customers, and managers are equally not likely to sign onto a scheme like that because they don't benefit from those paltry tips. Most restaurant theft happens with physical objects: copying your card information when it's taken away from the table, stealing tips from other servers because it can't be traced like the money in the drawer or from the card can be. The more reasonable (and super common) explanation is someone touched something by accident and assumed the other person touched it, and it got missed rushing you through. The blank faces are very easily explained as the service favorite: \"then why did you ask for the thing / press the button\" (even if you didn't and she did, lol). It's awkward, and annoying, but I don't think you need to look any deeper than that unless you get a repeat performance.", "NTA.

It\u2019s your money.", "NTA. I worked as a chef, cashier, and server at a restaurant and had no control over the same type of machine but hated flipping it and essentially asking for a tip.  By all rights if you didn\u2019t select it, you should get a refund. Again NTA", "NTA. You must be kidding. I thought tips were at least earned a little bit. You didn\u2019t have a party of ten. Screw this.", "No, if I\u2019m not having sit down service I don\u2019t tip. Unless it\u2019s a bar\u2026.. the amount of bs they deal with entities them to \u201ckeep the change\u201d a few times from me throughout the night lol\n\nEdit: NTA", "What IS possible though is some moisture or food was on the machine that registered the tip even if she didn't press it. Just like your phone does.", "yelp is a shit company do not support them", ">  and see if it happens to them too and if it does call the police, that's called theft.\n\nLocal police will take one look and say 'thats a civil matter' and leave.", "Then tell our government to pay people a fucking living wage.", "Local police will leave, but credit card fraud/theft is a federal offense.  I worked with a server who got taken out in cuffs by the FBI for adding double tips to credit cards.  If enough people complain to their credit card companies, the FBI will get involved.", "Great idea in theory and I agree in premise but I'm too old to be an idealist anymore.  Nothing is gonna change.  \n\n\nBut we live in a country where companies quash unions in a heartbeat.   Amazon invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into anti-union legislation rather than use it to pay employees better.\n\nIf you think paying servers less than minimum is going to change in your lifetime short of full scale revolution, well.....not tipping hurts the servers and that's it.", "Tipped employees are paid less by their employers because they're making minimum wage when tips are included. These jobs were *never* intended to be \"livable\" wages, full stop.", "I\u2019ll finish my letter with a \u201cpretty please\u201d for you homie", "How about tell your employer to pay people a wage.  Unionize!", "If the OP has to insert their card, usually that means they have an agreed total before they enter their PIN.\n\nAnother scenario is - they could have tapped the card then tipped after. I don't think I've come across this though. Maybe this is the new system you're talking about?", "NTA and what a fraudulent system they have.", "If you want better wages then you should get a job that requires some skill. Welcome to real life...where no one owes you a goddamned thing.", "Often, to the host/hostess and to the back-of-house. Yes, they get paid a wage, but it\u2019s not much and is usually supplemented by a percentage of tips.", "That's because you haven't thought this through all the way (as is typical of leftists). Tipped employees will do a better job because their wages are contingent on their customer service. If I know I'm going to make $X/hour no matter how good or shitty I do my job then *ding ding ding* there's no reason to do a good job.", "They should refuse that role as they are not compensated for it.", "It is not my job to subsidize their wage, I have only entered into that agreement with the waitstaff.", "Apparently I'm an asshole.  I don't think I've ever tipped for Starbucks.  Granted I don't get it often, but the thought never even occurred to me.\n\nThe bar comparison hit me though, I feel like a prick now.", "> we've always tipped bartenders and the guys at Starbucks are the exact same thing just without alcohol\n\nCorrect me if I am wrong considering i dont really deal with either situation, but isnt starbucks a  \nstand in line, order your drink, leave the line thing while a bartender would be more of a  \nsit at/near the bar, order a drink, stay there thing  \n\nTo me a good rule of thumb is if I have to wait in line for something its a no tip thing. If the person has to constantly pay attention to multiple groups to give good service to everyone then a tip might be appropriate.", "I have some news for you: Well paid employees will provide good service without tips. The service quality really doesnt depend on whether people are tipped or not, just on how much they are being paid.  \nA tipped worker earning minimum wage with the tips included is still only going to give you a minimum wage performance.  \nIf you want workers to give better service they need to get paid enough that its worth providing that better service and the employees dont give a shit if that money comes directly from the boss or from their bosses customers.", "They have enough actual tables that they end up making the real minimum wage for the night, but they don't make nearly as much as they would if they weren't on carry out.\n\nAnd most servers don't live in a world where they can refuse to do something management tells them to do. They'll get written up at best, may get sect home for the night, may get less desirable shifts in the future, and may even get fired.\n\nThe standard for carry out at a sit down restaurant is 10%. Should it be that way? No. Should we fight to change a system that was built because racism and is today used to trap people in poverty? Absolutely. Should we do that by refusing to tip? No. That just makes the workers suffer and does nothing to the owners who should pay their workers a living wage.", "When you tip your waiter, you\u2019re usually also indirectly tipping the back of house employees.", "What places are waiters tipping out BOH? Bussers/Host/Bartenders I\u2019ve seen, but the line/dishies?"]}
