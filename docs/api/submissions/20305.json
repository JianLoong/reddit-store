Cupcakes aside, I think you did the right thing by kicking him out (although I think this should have been done *way* sooner, given his atrocious behavior throughout the whole event) and I don't know why anyone, even someone's parents, would side with someone who intentionally makes kids feel bad and cry.", "NTA\n\nHas your cousin just recently learned to read?

He should have been kicked out of the graduation. Heck at this point throw him out of the family along with his parents.

Nothing you've described of his behaviour sounds like normal interaction, especially as it relates to the young kids.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I saw in some of your replies that your cousin \"hates children in general\".
