We come from a toxic family. We have three other siblings neither of us speaks to, and our parents were the overly strict kind of parents who veered into bullying with how tough they would be on us. Nothing was good enough. If we weren't getting A's we were in trouble and if we did get A's but we didn't make any progress in our jobs that we had in high school, we were told that at their age, back in their home country, they were earning enough to help feed their families and were also expected to do well in school. They would also say we had it good. Friends were overrated in my parents eyes. Being sick was not an excuse to miss anything. One time I was in the hospital after a severe allergic reaction and my parents went to my teacher and brought me school work to do. I was 8 years old at the time. Another time I had a really bad flu and my parents did let me stay home from school but my B on the test we had the week I went back was a grounding offense.\n\nI never had a good relationship with any of my siblings but my sister has made attempts for us to remain in touch and she wants a closer relationship with me. But she has her issues left over from our parents that can make her unbearable. She calls herself my elder, before she got married she expected my help just because I was a man and she was a woman.\n\nWe're both married now. My wife and I are expecting our second child. My sister is expecting her first. She invited my wife and I to lunch with her and her husband to announce the news to us and to announce they were having a boy. My sister was not happy. She started complaining that she wanted a family of all girls and how could God do this to her. She said she'll never be the grandma. She'll always be the dad's mom and if she's having a boy now she's probably going to have a family of all boys. My wife pointed out that dad's family doesn't mean you're not close and she pointed out that her mom is extremely close to her dad's family and that she never had a single thing to do with her mom's family. She also said that her three brothers and their families are very close and they are adored by their grandkids.\n\nMy sister dismissed my wife's reasoning and said she knows nobody who could say that. She was also rude to her and told her she was interrupting a conversation she wasn't part of. I got pissed at her for talking to my wife like that and told her she was out of line. In return, she was pissed and said it was easy for me to say because my wife and I are expecting a girl. That we didn't get stuck with a useless boy only. I lost my cool and asked her why she got pregnant then if she was going to reject a boy and refuse to even try seeing it as a good thing. She told me because she wanted only girls and it was none of my business anyway.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693564119, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1673e0c/aita_for_getting_pissy_with_my_sister_and_for/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your response is by no means out of line.  My heart goes out to your nephew to be.  He's in for a world of emotional abuse.", "NTA and I feel bad for that poor baby because his mother is going to resent him from the minute he is born. Your sister has issues and while what you said may have been a bit rude, you are right in the sense of why in the world is she having kids if she only wants one gender. What a sin, please don't let your nephew grow up feeling unloved. I hope the father is at least a caring man and not an ungrateful crap bag of a human like your sister seems to be.", "The sex must be real good for your BIL to marry and choose to have a child with a blatant misandrist.

Granted having a boy vs girl is a lot different than than a perfect EV shiny female Eevee, but she's going to have so much stress having to release all these boys into the wild from her PC while trying to breed a girl.\n\nIt's going to be even harder if she wants only shiny girls too!", "YTA\n\nWas your comment helpful? Did it make her excited about having a boy?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes, she is being unreasonable and insane. It's probably hormones, I assume she just learned this and is just working through the disappointment now. When someone is being insanely upset about them, getting mad at them is not going to help them get over it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe needs to work through her disappointment. And you know what? She probably will. Most parents who wanted a specific sex get over it. She just needs to be disappointed, experience that feeling, and move on. But right now, let her grieve the daughter she isn't having. She's got plenty of time to get over it and get excited about her son.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest strategy is to first acknowledge her sadness, \"I know, it's rough, you wanted a girl so bad, you would have been a great girl mom\" and THEN go into what your wife did, \"But you're going to love that boy and you will totally raise him to want to visit you and bring the grandkids\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow if she doesn't get over it by the time the baby is there it is another matter.", "Very soft YTA. You are trying when most would walk away. However, You aren\u2019t her therapist you are her sibling. Knowing all of the toxicity that you are both bringing into the relationship, your first rule needs to be to get along and pivot away from anything controversial while you both heal.  Any version of \u201cthe feelings you shared are wrong\u201d needs to stay in your mind and not come out of your mouth.\n\nKudos to you for recognizing your trauma and trying to navigate rough waters with your sibling.   Take the long view and understand that for now while you are both healing and learning what are appropriate boundaries and conversations, your communication may be a bit constrained. However, this is a process not an end point and you can still grow your relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
