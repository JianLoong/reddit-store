We come from a toxic family. We have three other siblings neither of us speaks to, and our parents were the overly strict kind of parents who veered into bullying with how tough they would be on us.

If we weren't getting A's we were in trouble and if we did get A's but we didn't make any progress in our jobs that we had in high school, we were told that at their age, back in their home country, they were earning enough to help feed their families and were also expected to do well in school. They would also say we had it good. Friends were overrated in my parents eyes. Being sick was not an excuse to miss anything. One time I was in the hospital after a severe allergic reaction and my parents went to my teacher and brought me school work to do. I was 8 years old at the time. Another time I had a really bad flu and my parents did let me stay home from school but my B on the test we had the week I went back was a grounding offense.\n\nI never had a good relationship with any of my siblings but my sister has made attempts for us to remain in touch and she wants a closer relationship with me. But she has her issues left over from our parents that can make her unbearable. She calls herself my elder, before she got married she expected my help just because I was a man and she was a woman.\n\nWe're both married now. My wife and I are expecting our second child. My sister is expecting her first. She invited my wife and I to lunch with her and her husband to announce the news to us and to announce they were having a boy. My sister was not happy. She started complaining that she wanted a family of all girls and how could God do this to her. She said she'll never be the grandma. She'll always be the dad's mom and if she's having a boy now she's probably going to have a family of all boys. My wife pointed out that dad's family doesn't mean you're not close and she pointed out that her mom is extremely close to her dad's family and that she never had a single thing to do with her mom's family. She also said that her three brothers and their families are very close and they are adored by their grandkids.\n\nMy sister dismissed my wife's reasoning and said she knows nobody who could say that. She was also rude to her and told her she was interrupting a conversation she wasn't part of. I got pissed at her for talking to my wife like that and told her she was out of line. In return, she was pissed and said it was easy for me to say because my wife and I are expecting a girl. That we didn't get stuck with a useless boy only. I lost my cool and asked her why she got pregnant then if she was going to reject a boy and refuse to even try seeing it as a good thing.

She could have gotten IVF and had an annalmost guaranteed chance of having a girl, or she could have adopted. Really though, that's not the issue here. \n\nI say this with the utmost love. Please get into therapy if you are not already there. You have had a hard childhood, and just like anyone else would, you need to work through it. So does your sister?

This doesn't mean she is allowed to get away with shit bc 'that's how she is,\" none of it is an excuse for her behavior. It is a reason, though, and reasons should guide your approach to things. Her childhood experience damaged her, it seems, one many levels. She needs support in order to heal. But only be there to support her as long as it's not damaging to you. \n\nCongratulations on your second. I hope everything goes well and everyone is happy and healthy.

NYA", "She can put the child up for adoption rather than keep the baby and abuse him..NTA.", "NTA - your sister has no business having a child if that's how she feels about having a boy!  I'm genuinely concerned that she will be abusive or neglectful towards him.", "If your sister didn't want a male baby, perhaps she shouldn't have had sex with someone possessing a Y chromosome. Advise her that for the next kid, she may want try cloning or perhaps asexual reproduction. Also document everything she says about her child so CPS (or whatever) can have a good case. \n\nNTA", "I hope that you can keep in touch with your sister - that poor little boy is going to need lots of love from other people like you.", "Wow she needs jesus", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m concerned that she really shouldn\u2019t be having any children until she works on her issues", "NTA.\nI feel really bad for the kid. He's going to have a childhood worse than yours.", "NTA\n\n\"Al quien no le gusta el caldo le dan tres tazas m\u00e1s.\"\n\"Who doesn't like the broth, they give me three more cups.\"\n\nAnd she needs to deal with that. It's her creation, and sometimes your creation doesn't turn out the way you wanted it to go. Look at God, he created humans in hope for something better, and he has to deal with the fact that were not. But, unlike humanity, the boy can become a good thing and she needs to understand that it's not a lost cause. If you want to be close to the grandchildren, you need to pit your effort as well.", "NTA, but have you gone to therapy? Because the explanation about how your parents treated you seemed more like needed venting than something necessary to understand the conflict with your sister. You may want to find a professional that lets you vent and helps you to process that childhood.", "Your sister sounds like she's going to be a terrible mom. That poor kid is going to grow up and realize (especially if they try for other kids and the rest are all girls) that he is unloved and hated simply because he was born a boy.\n\nThat's as toxic as it can get and you should quit talking to her. As much as she wants to build a relationship it just isn't worth it", "Your sister is a sexist jerk NTA. If she wanted all girls that much she could of adopted girls, or as much as I feel horrible for saying this, get an abortion or put the kid up for adoption. Would be a lot better than having the poor kid in a household where his mother hates him", "NTA.\nI really feel sorry for her son.\nI hope her husband leaves her and gets full custody his son.\nI fear she will in some way be very abusive to him.", "Your sister was being rude to your wife and I commend you for standing up for your missus. Your sister's tantrum about the baby's gender was over the top. But I don't necessarily agree with the comments predicting favoritism or abuse. There is a huge leap from handling the disappointment poorly to not loving or harming her child. Her concern appears to come from a fear that she won't be close to her grandchildren. I don't think it was your place to question her decision to get pregnant but I'm still voting NTA because she was over the top and being very rude to you and especially to your wife.", "NTA. \n>She'll always be the dad's mom and if she's having a boy now she's probably going to have a family of all boys\n\nTell your sister that the baby's gender is her husband's *'fault'*", "OMG! NTA, But the sister urgently needs therapy, being the mother of a boy is beautiful, first i wanted a girl and in fact at first the doctor told me that it was a girl and i was in heaven, but weeks later he confirmed that it was a boy, at first I was disappointed but over time I made peace with the situation, now I honestly can't imagine my life without my boy, I discovered that he is not different from a girl and everything depends on the education and love you give to your children.", "Reading this post turned me into a woman hating incel. Going to need therapy.\n\nAt least I didn't become Godzilla and then die from a stroke.", "Yeah. I did want a girl myself but was blessed with three healthy boys. There is a healthy way to hope for one gender but don't get pregnant without being willing to accept the gender outcome.", "True. No matter if she has a boy or a girl, both will be miserable because of her attitude.\n\nThe boy will be derided, the girl will be smothered.", "I don't get that logic. Males can have children too, thus getting her a grandkid. Also just because she has a girl, doesn't mean the kid is going to want her own children", "I was thrilled that I had all boys, I would have been happy to have a girl too, but having all boys was great.", "Which affects early elementary aged children at the oldest and is irrelevant to the adult disparity.", "That's probably not much comfort to the Chinese men born in the early 80's who will be in their 50's by the time the kids born after the new policy are old enough to start dating.", "And then when they do, reddit will call them out for the age gap..."]}
