I could have just gone to the diner or the other restaurant and made it work, even though I actually don't think that other restaurants can take 7 people since its small. And I really, really just wanted to eat here as I've been craving a burger all week.

They invited extra people, and it wasn\u2019t their place to do so. Your birthday, your decision.", "NTA at all. Both sets of parents involved here suck and haven't put their kids first. Your parents should've cancelled their babysitting offer when it was evident that the date in question was their own child's birthday. Your cousin needs to prioritise being parents over \"hang out with friends\", and when it was apparent that your parents were babysitting on your birthday, your cousin should've had the decency to cancel their social plans, stay with their own kid at home and leave your parents to spend time with you.", "NTA", "Well, they started babysitting at 9am and the dinner was at 5pm. She was back from hanging out by then.", "Well, they started babysitting at 9am and the dinner was at 5pm. She was back from hanging out by then.", "Then they didn't have to go... it was rude to invite people when all they could have told them was that they had prior plans at 5pm.", "So they didn\u2019t double book. Double booking would have been them saying they would watch the cousin\u2019s kid at the same time as your dinner. My vote stands but now I\u2019m saying your parents are A Hs", "So... the mother was back and they were free to go by that time? Why ask the cousin then? Something doesn't add up here.", "So your parents were done babysitting and didn't need to add all those extra people.", "No, no, my cousin is the kid's mom. And my cousin and her boyfriend was out with friends and asked my mom to babysit their kid. And they were done with that and came back to the apartment. And they apparently invited her to the dinner when she got back because my cousin also wanted to come when she found out.", "Yes, this is exactly what I understood\n\n\nSorry, this does not add up to a coherent story.", "Right but the person's point is that the cousin was done with friends so could have taken her kid home and your parents could have joined you as planned. Instead they changed the plan and invited more people which is rude", "Oh, yeah. That's true. It was really annoying.", "NTA your parents were done babysitting by the time you went to dinner, there was no reason to bring the cousin, her kid and her boyfriend. They should\u2019ve handed the kid back to your cousin and said we have plans with OP for their birthday", "That being the case, your parents messed up.  I\u2019d have cancelled, too.", "NTA, I hope you had a good dinner.  They should have made reservations and not brought all the other people along.", "NTA.\n\nThey invited all of these extra people without giving you a heads up.\n\nGlad your brother celebrated with you.", "NTA", "Nta. They made it all about everyone but you. I\u2019m sorry.", "NTA. I would not have worried about hurting their feelings, they deserved it for inviting extra people.", "Your parents didn't double book but NTA. You are allowed to not want several extra guests at a birthday dinner that was supposed to be you and your parents. Especially since the restaurant couldn't sear you.", "NTA", "Is your family Hispanic perchance this sounds like something mine would do", "So they didn't have to watch her kid anymore, and didn't have to bring anyone to your dinner, but chose to. And invited people without making sure you were okay with it. That's very inconsiderate.", "Free meal probably."]}
