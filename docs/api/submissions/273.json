We thought it would be a good idea because were both good communicators and we are good friends but things have gone downhill.\n\nShe did not go to college or trade school and worked right out of high school at an ok job. She quit her job when we moved and said she would take some time off. 4 months later and she still has no job.\n\nShe does not have her drivers license and relies on me to drive her around and makes excuses why she can\u2019t get it (mostly money).\n\nWe live in a really wealthy area so job options for non college none trade are pretty low and she is set on working 9-5 M-F no weekends or nights but doesn\u2019t want to teach or be any kind of office or receptionist worker. All the shops/stores around us pay around 15$ an hour.\n\nShe has made me multiple promises that shes going to get a job and her license. \n\nShe has an older cat who is not well trained. I got a kitten a few months ago. The problem is her cat eats ALL of my cats food. If Im not paying attention, he will eat her whole can of wet food and all of her dry in 5 minutes.\n\nI tested how much he would actually eat\u2026 I filled up the bowl with 1/2 cup (double the portion size) 2x in one day and he ate it all by himself. On top of it he has gained quite a bit of weight.\n\nI brought this up to her and she denied anything was wrong with her cat. I said ok and locked my cat in at mealtimes. The problem is she\u2019s a grazer and will not eat all her food in one sitting. I got one of those straps that hook onto your door and make it so it can open only a tiny sliver. He slams his way into my room.\n\nHe also uses my cats litterbox exclusively because she never cleans his and because he eats so much he actually fills an entire litterbox in one day and my cat will go to the bathroom right outside it because hers is too dirty.\n\nMy only other option is to get one of those indoor barriers in which her cat would wear a collar and anytime he tries to go into my room it would beep/vibrate and she acted like I was trying to torture her cat. \n\nAt this Point Im really fucking annoyed but I love her and want to help her. Shes like a sister to me but cant take criticism well.\n\nPLEASE HELP", "created_utc": 1667270110, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yiwfhs/aita_for_wanting_my_friend_to_man_up/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I get that you love her, but she\u2019s taking total advantage of your good nature. But if you can afford to support her and drive her around, that\u2019s your choice. I feel sorry for your cat.", "I agree with u/DoesntLikeTurtles. YTA for not telling her to move out.\n\nShe obv has some mental problems and is incredibly lazy. Telling her to \u201cman up\u201d is just gonna cause a fight that won\u2019t fix anything. This can\u2019t be fixed without her leaving.", "So I literally just read this on r/Cats and thought it would be a good condenser for here... Glad you posted it here because now I feel like I can respond:\n\nNTA, you gotta care for your cat. And it doesn't sound like she takes care of hers. If her cat is using your litter box, she should be helping scoop it (and vise versa), it should really probably just be a shared/turn-based chore. As for food, you'll probably have to train your cat to eat right away instead of grazing or else get a special cat door with a collar.", "We just adopted our second cat a few weeks ago, we're still working on getting them to eat together but I read online feeding them at the same time out of different bowls, on different placemats/floor mats, on opposite sides of the same pet gate will teach them which food is who's (if they have different food, that's a bonus). However, neither of my cats are grazers. To train yours not to graze you simply take the food bowl away after 10-15 minutes (I'm sure there's more to it, I'd look it up online and ask your vet)\n\nEither way, I'd definitely try to have a frank conversation with your roommate about how her behavior/care methods simply don't work for two cats, regardless who's cat is who's. If she loves her cat and is such a good and close friend, she should understand that you're only trying to work with her so both cats can be happy. Explain to her that her cat overusing your box is teaching your cat not to use the litter box and that's unsanitary (and possibly grounds for not getting your security deposit of you rent).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
