{"id": 31254, "submission_id": "17yjz8v", "title": "AITA for leaving my sister-in-law's house without my wife?", "selftext": "My wife and I are in our mid 30s and we've been together for 8 years, married for 4. We're both from California. My wife's only sibling is her sister who recently moved back to California from Virginia. \n\nMy wife's sister & her husband & their 3 kids live about an hour away. It's easier for my wife to visit them than the other way around because they'd be lugging around 3 kids while we don't have any kids yet. So my wife typically visits them 1-2 times a week for weekday dinner or a shopping trip on the weekend. I join every 3 weeks or so for dinner. I have ZERO problem with my sister-in-law and her family. They're good people and if anything I'm glad my wife has her best friend so close by. \n\nSo for context my entire life I've always had really bad colds. Getting the flu? Annoying but not horrible, 4/10 levels of discomfort. COVID? My bout wasn't too bad, maybe 4.5/10. But my yearly cold? 8.5/10. My body just shuts down for 4-5 days. My wife and closest people in my life (siblings, parents, some life-long friends) have known about this and everyone always thought I was the type to exaggerate about illness in general until I got the flu and COVID back-to-back years and hardly made a peep. They all expressed afterwards that they NOW realize how bad my colds are. \n\nThe incident is this -- yesterday my wife and I went to my sister-in-law's house for dinner. When we got there, the three kids all had colds. Coughing, runny noses, sore throats, fatigue, all of it. I immediately panicked internally and thought \"damn it, here we go\" and thought that I'd try my best to stay away from the kids. Then I hear my wife say something along the lines of \"aww honey, I know you're sick your mama has been telling me about it all week\" to her niece. \n\nThat really pissed me off. My wife knew the kids were sick and knows how horrible it is for me when I'm sick, but she didn't bother to tell me. I pulled her to the side for a second and she basically said \"listen, just don't get near the kids. I didn't tell you because I knew you wouldn't come and it'd kill the vibe. Relax, I'm sure they're not contagious. Now enjoy the night\" and walked away. \n\nIt's not even the fact that the kids are sick but the fact that (1) she purposely didn't tell me and (2) she was shutting me down. So I got the keys and left. I know my sister-in-law and her husband well enough to know they'd drop my wife back at home but I was just seeing red and way too angry to have stayed. \n\nI woke up this morning and my wife is freaking PISSED. My sister-in-law's husband is even more annoyed than my sister-in-law, he's saying I'm a pathetic person to leave my wife and take the car.", "created_utc": 1700352338, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17yjz8v/aita_for_leaving_my_sisterinlaws_house_without_my/", "score": 1975, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have 3 kids and when they are sick they smear their snot everywhere. I have caught my eight year old wing her nose on the fresh kitchen hand towel. (Wash you hands dry them on fresh boogers-so gross) I guarantee that there were cold germs all over that house if all the kids were sick. Sofa cushions, dining room table and chairs, door knobs, light switches, kitchen drawers and cabinets. What your wife did is fucked up. I would have left too but I probably would have called an Uber or something or just sat in the car during the whole dinner. At the very least I probably would have said \u201cI am leaving now.

The kids are coughing, have sore throats, runny noses and she tells you to stay away from them and they probably aren't contagious anyway? Did she not learn anything from COVID?!\n\nI'll be one of the firsts to smirk at the ongoing joke about \"man flu\" but when my hubby and boys weren't feeling well I did everything I could to help them feel better.

Because I love them and don't want them to suffer needlessly. \n\nYour wife was selfish, and she continues to be so. \"Kill the vibe\"? Seriously? It sounds like she only has you around for entertainment value. What an ass!\n\nAs for your BIL, wait until he gets the flu and call him a pathetic person. Is it the same? Not really, but it has it coming to him anyway.", "NTA.\nHave you been tested for primary immunodeficiencies? I have 2 of them. Before I received treatment, I ALWAYS had upper respiratory infections.

I\u2019m going with ESH", "NTA. I have a very strong immune system and rarely get sick, but I would have left in that situation. Especially since the kids were sick. Kid germs tend to be the strongest for some reason. Either that or it's just that they don't wash their hands enough and leave their noses snotty. The last thing I want to be around is a sick child. \n\nMy husband and I had a similar incident except that we both left. My mother insisted that we visit for my son's first Christmas. She and her fiance lived a 12-hour drive away. We agreed to go and were 11 hours into our drive when I called my mother to let her know we would see her in about an hour. That was the moment she chose to tell me that her fiance had been sick for the last few days with the flu. She knew darn well that we wouldn't have come if we had known that he was sick. She let us come with a nine month old baby. If there had been any hotels available, I would have gone to one, but they lived in a very rural area. Of course my son was the first to get sick and then my husband. On Christmas Eve morning I begged my mother to call her fiance's kids and let them know that everyone is sick and they shouldn't come. She refused to do that because she wanted the whole family together. Note that these people weren't our family. By noon on Christmas Eve I was extremely sick. My son was getting better and so is my husband. On Christmas morning I was still really sick but I just wanted to go home. I packed up all of our belongings and we loaded up the car and my husband took us all back home. Of course my mother was very upset about this, but I didn't feel bad at all. My mother should never have done that to us. Considering that we had all the flexibility we wanted, we could have come up a week later with no trouble at all and she knew that.\n\nYour wife us the the AH here and owes you a huge apology.", "NTA. You should have a serious discussion with your wife about her and  her family's behavior.  They know how sick you get with a cold, but they lied to you for their own selfish reasons. Marriage is about trust. Can you now trust your wife to place your health above her wants? She did not need to see her family, she wanted to see them. She risked your health rather than waiting a week. She and her family owe you an apology.", "NTA, but your wife sure is. \u201cIt\u2019d kill the vibe\u201d is some warped thinking. Be sure to show her your post so she can can start to get an idea of how wrong she was to pull that stunt with your health.", "NTA. That whole family except the kids are AH.

Good thing you don't have children.", "You're not the AH for leaving, but you're kind of an AH for not telling your wife you were leaving, with her or without her.

Their kid got my kid sick who was then hospitalized for 2 weeks. \n\nIf someone is sick don\u2019t socialize. Your wife was an AH here for hiding it.", "Your SIL and BIL are assholes for having people over when their kids have colds and are obviously contagious. Your wife is an asshole for not giving a shit if you get sick and not warning you in advance about the situation. Leaving was entirely appropriate. Since your wife won't look out for you, you will always have to be on your guard in case she decides it's OK to expose you to sick people.", "NTA\n\nYour wife misled you in order to ensure her plans weren't detailed at the patenting cost of your health.  \n\nThat's crazy. \n\nI'm chronically ill.  I catch everything and what can be a small child for a kid can cost me weeks.  I would be livid and possibly have Osiris quarantine protocols when my spouse returned home.", "NTA\n\nThis drives me crazy with parents. They KNOW their children are sick. They have gotten sick from their children. Yet they invite others over or come over themselves. I know people like that and they just say \"oh they are always that way\" or \"it is that season\". Your wife and in-laws were 100% wrong for not telling you. They were extremely inconsiderate toward you.\n\nWhen this happens to me I take Zicam rapidmelts. One every four hours. And up the vitamins. Knock on wood so far so good.", "NTA.\n\nYou not coming would have \u201ckilled the vibe\u201d so she didn\u2019t tell you thee was a risk of you getting an illness that shuts you down for a week?\n\nIf ever there was a test for your wife\u2019s compassion or consideration for you, this was it and she failed.\n\nYou didn\u2019t leave her in the middle of the street and it wasn\u2019t like you not going would have even stopped her from going.\n\nBIL is only pissed because he had to drive 2 hours to drop your wife off.", "NTA.  I\u2019m appalled by your wife\u2019s behavior. She lied to you. Does she do this often? She put your health at risk. Even if only she went, she\u2019d still put you at risk because she probably will catch it and then so will you since you live together. So thoughtless. She doesn\u2019t regret her actions or is even slightly apologetic. Why are you with this woman? Please seriously reflect on your relationship.", "Nta I would have been pissed to show up at a house with sick kids. I\u2019m general it\u2019s very rude but her knowing you get really sick means she doesn\u2019t care about you and put her want to see her sister before you. She easily could have just seen her sister the week after. \n\nThis problem is bigger than just this. You need to have a talk with her about her caring about you as much as she cares about her wants", "I'll go against the flow and say ESH.\n\nYour wife is definitely TA. If you had left, gone out for a nice dinner yourself, then picked your wife up - I would definitely say NTA. \n\nBut you left her stranded an hour away from home, thereby forcing her brother-in-law to spend 2 hours he wasn't planning on having to drive her home and then back again. None of this was your BIL's or SIL's fault since they evidently communicated the situation to your wife ahead of time.\n\nYour wife was an ass to you, you were an ass to your BIL and SIL.", "ESH\n\n\\- Your wife manipulated the situation to try and get an outcome that only satisfied her needs at the expense of yours.\n\n\\-You should have communicated to the group that you could not be in the house with sick kids, and if you had known prior you would not have come, and then asked you wife if she would like to leave with you or arrange transportation with her family. Then discussed the situation at home between the 2 of you.\n\nWhile I think what your wife did was wrong you had the option to communicate rationally about your boundary and options - but instead you lost emotional control acted irrationally and that's what everyone will remember from this situation.", "ESH\n\nAnd I mean *everyone*. \n\nWho in their right mind exposes themselves, let alone anyone else to three kids all sick at once? \n\nI don't think this excuses you completely bailing on your wife.  Honestly, the damage is kind of done as soon as either of you walks through the door.", "Well you\u2019re both AH. Seriously. Did you at least tell your wife you\u2019re not staying before you left at least.", "Ooooooof this is tough only because you took her real means of coming home. It forced your BIL or SIL to leave their three sick kids to make a two hour round trip to bring her home, when this whole thing really isn\u2019t their problem.\n\nYour wife is a huge asshole here.

It isn\u2019t even about the sickness, it is about how your wife is treating you. \n\n- Her marriage \u201cvibe\u201d is all wrong. You two are supposed to be a team that mutually respects, supports, and promotes the autonomy and decisions of the other person. The height of respect is supporting a person even and especially when you don\u2019t understand or agree with their decisions. The only exception is when it clearly and adversely affects your partner. \n\n- She\u2019s treating you like a child by making decisions for you. She doesn\u2019t have the right to do that, and it is a great way to undermine your trust and relationships. It is disrespectful to believe she knows better than you and her judgement overrules yours. It makes me suspect that her approach to you may be less \u201chow do we solve this together\u201d and more, \u201chere\u2019s what I want, let me push you to do it.\u201d\n\n- The fact that she put the \u201cvibe\u201d over your health is not only a decision she had no authority to make, but shows a lack of consideration and degree of self-centeredness that is completely inappropriate in a romantic partnership. \n\n- The way she spoke to you was dismissive and condescending. \u201cRelax, enjoy your night.\u201d Walking away. As if your needs and feelings were irrelevant, and she didn\u2019t need to listen to your half of the story, and arrogantly felt her word was final. That\u2019s a violation of your bond and the type of attitude that will lead to divorce long term. \n\n- Removing yourself from a situation is a healthy way to deal with violations of personal boundaries.\n\n\nFor your SIL\u2019a husband/SIL: tell them that you can\u2019t air your private matters, but there was something more serious going on between you that you can\u2019t get into. Tell her that you understand how it looked and how badly it inconvenienced them. That you sincerely appreciate that she brought your wife back safety. If she pesters or tries to pull you into an argument, just keep telling her that although you know she wants to defend her sister and was inconvenienced by this, you need to handle this privately with your wife, and can\u2019t go into details. Then don\u2019t. Just keep thanking her for her support and for the rude. If she keeps trying, just say you\u2019ve got to go.\n\nWith your wife - this pattern of behavior will ruin your marriage. Whether she learned it from her parents or watching other couples, it isn\u2019t ok. You cannot have kids if she keeps treating you this way. Marriage counseling, Gottman workbooks, I suggest an Imago workshop. My experience with imago helped not only in other relationships (friendships/family), but even in defusing a tense issue with a stranger.\n\nRegardless, *take this seriously.* This is a big deal. This attitude will prevent you two from having a happy marriage. Your relationship will degrade into resentments, tit-for-tat exchanges, unproductive conflicts, and worse. It isn\u2019t about the cold, it is an incredibly unhealthy perspective she\u2019s been modeled or taught or absorbed (unfortunately not uncommon in the media) that *will* degrade your trust and love over time. \n\nPlease feel free to show this to her. Let her know that I know this myself because I used to be the \u201cdecisive\u201d one, and didn\u2019t realize how arrogant it was until my marriage almost ended. It took a lot of reading, learning, and more to begin to understand that my mindset towards relationships seemed positive or proactive, but was pushing people away. I now see it in other unhappy marriages and among people who tend to \u201ctake over\u201d because \u201cno one is doing what needs to be done,\u201d not realizing how unnecessary, invasive, and arrogant it was and how it drove people away.", "Mid 30s and phrase \"kill the vibe\" gives me ick.", "I am the same way when I get sick it\u2019s like a total body take over.
