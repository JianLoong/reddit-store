My younger brother was 5 at the time. Dad dedicated time to us over the next 6 years and did not date or anything. But when I was 14 he sat my brother and me down and explained to us that he was interested in dating again and it would not replace our mom but he felt ready to find someone to share his life with again. We both had conflicting emotions. We told him this. But we also told him we wanted him to be happy. The three of us went to therapy together and the therapist explained to him that conflicting emotions would play a role in that kind of thing going forward. She said our love for him would always mean we wanted his happiness but that our love for our mom would mean we wouldn't share the same level of joy as him. Dad asked some questions about that and she said he should expect us to be respectful and it would be nice if we could like her, but anything more would be down to chance. She told him to not take our relationship with a future partner of his as a reflection of our relationship with him or his parenting of us. \n\nShe told us to keep an open mind and suggested that if we struggle seeing him with someone else, or if he were to get married and the wedding was tough, to consider journaling or finding a trusted someone we could speak to who wasn't our dad. She said we could keep the lines of communication open with him and confide in him. But if it was an ongoing weirdness that maybe someone else would be the better confidant. \n\nDad did meet someone and he has been married to Beth for the last 11 years. Beth was a widowed mom and had lost her husband some years prior. But unlike my dad Beth's first marriage was toxic and unhealthy and this is where I think some of the drama has come into play.\n\nWhen I moved out I asked dad for some copies of his and mom's wedding photos and he gave them to me gladly. I have a couple of them on display in my home and others I keep in a little treasure album I put together. Beth and Beth's youngest child are upset that I display photos from my parents wedding and not her and my dad's wedding. She spoke to me about it several months ago and told me it would really make her and the kids feel accepted if I were to display one from each wedding instead of just my parents wedding. I explained to her that I enjoyed seeing my parents wedding photos and I did not do it to hurt her or any of her kids but the photos would remain.\n\nShe escalated the dispute the other week when she complained to my dad about it for the first time. He called and asked me if she had said something to me. I said yes, he apologized, and she told me that all I had to do was swap out one of my parents wedding photos for one from her wedding to dad. She told me I didn't support my dad and neither did my brother since we showed no fondness for their wedding. She accused me of hating them and she told me that this was \"our happily ever after\" and I was stomping all over that.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698133955, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17f7gif/aita_for_keeping_photos_from_my_parents_wedding/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I do not have photos from his second wedding. I was aware that his wife was upset by this and that her youngest child was upset by it too. She had asked me to change that. I didn't. I feel like maybe I could have removed the photos to keep the peace and that way none of this drama would be happening. Even with my dad on my side I feel like this has caused a lot of trouble and as an adult I could have prevented it by being more considerate to the issues the photos would cause.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I would ask, was there a family photo taken at the wedding with everyone?  I\u2019d put an 8x10 of that up to allow her her delusion and move on. You can cherish the happy faces of your loved ones and have a reference for the new people.  It\u2019s just a peace keeping thought. Because she has no right. But she does have the right to feel hurt.", "I feel like every story on this sub where someone marries a partner who already has kids needs to hear what your dad's therapist said. I've never heard it put so well. Most likely the kids won't have any affection for the new partner and that's OK. That's just life and being human. And people need to accept that. NTA. Your dad's wife needs to get a grip. You haven't done anything wrong. And even if it was somehow rude to only have photos of your parents (it's not), she cannot control what you do. She has no say in what you display and she should know that.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with people like those. Hugs!", "I don't think it will be as simple as him telling her to stop. Therapy might be something he considers but I know this will be a huge thing for him because they did therapy before they got married so expectations would be reasonable and she was on board.\n\nI think there is a little bit of a need to erase her past and to end up with the storybook happily ever after. The kind of perfection she never got close to with her first husband.", "I explained what had happened. He's especially frustrated because they had therapy before they got married because she was dreaming of a Brady Bunch family after the wedding and dad knew because of the therapy we did a few years before that it was unlikely to be that. She came out of therapy saying all the right things and she had relaxed some. But I wonder if that was just her going along with whatever so she could try and get that happily ever after she wanted so badly.", "My dad might do that. They saw a therapist before they got married and it appeared like all the concerns were resolved. Beth had this dream of a Brady Bunch style family and dad did not want them to marry if that was something she could not let go of. She appeared to and said all the right things after a period of time in therapy and from her actions she did appear to have accepted the reality we actually had. But clearly she did not fully or it was something that never completely went away.\n\nSo I don't know if they will do therapy now. I guess it will depend on how conversations go about the topic over the next while.\n\nThere isn't anything like that I can think of. Mine and my brother's graduations would be the closest but I never printed any of all of us together. I printed some for the album I have with combos of my dad, brother and me. I guess I could print one where Beth and her kids are in them too and display it. Though I might wait to see how things go down before I do.", "None of that is your problem\n\nYour always going to love and cherish your Mum. \n\nYou are going to need to let your Dad know that you will need to take a step back while they sort through this as you want zero part of this. \n\nYou will not be replacing photos of your Mum for her. \n\nShe\u2019s your Mum. \n\nThis lady is your Dads wife. \n\nWhile you\u2019re happy for him. She doesn\u2019t get to replace your Mum. \n\nAnd the more she pushes you then more steps back you will take", "I think she expected \"oh that was child thoughts. They will see I'm a perfect mom and will love me when they see it\" \nCompletely rose tinted glasses and ignored what a professional and your dad were saying. \nAnd now she's frustrated that everyone else was right. She couldn't wave her magic wand and make everyone love her and have a perfect family. And you kids fawning over her kids. \n\nShe's blind to the fact \"perfect\" Dosnt mean you all call her mom and have her pictures hanging. Etc. \nThere is no thing like movie perfect family. You love your dad, and you are wishing for his happiness. That is \"perfect\" as well. She should focus on her and your dad's marriage. Her kids. Being friendly to you when you are over. She's your dad's wife. Not your new mom.\nShe honestly might need a new trip to the therapist.", "TV is not reality. She strives to obtain a false sense of family; what a shame!", "This! 100% this. This us exactly how to handle this situation. Take yourself out of the drama. \n\nHaving photos of your parents\u2019 wedding is sweet.", "I think there's also some trauma mixed in with all of this. Her first marriage was probably one of the worst kinds a woman can go through and his death added more stress on top of the relief I think she felt when he was gone. So when she did move on, which I think she probably had wanted to for a while she imagined it would be like a first family for everyone and we would all find it to be the best thing that happened to us. It makes sense for her and her kids to feel that way given how bad they had it before. But it was not bad for us before. Dad loved and still loves mom. We love mom. She never did anything bad to us like that.\n\nSo she clings to this dream and doesn't want to accept that her dream, the thing she likely wants most in this world, is not going to happen that way. She and her kids were not some dream come true to my brother and me.\n\nI also think you're right that she thought kid us would say stuff like that but as adults we would have fallen into almost a habit maybe of relying on her like we would a mother and seeing her kids as siblings equally to my brother and me.", "The trauma part, yes, is why I said she chose to ignore what the therapist and your dad said. Becouse it would ruin her dreams of a picture-perfect family. She did not want to face they were indeed right. \nAnd when she realised they were indeed right. Well. The rose tinted glasses of \"they are kids they Don't know what they are saying. They will love me, \" shattered. \n\nThis happens a lot. \nI've personally met men who were in the \"oh your kids will love me. I'll be a great dad!\" A few months into just talking. And I had to ask them to drop that idea. The kids have a dad. And two are almost adults. \nThey won't be swooping in and be the new manly man the kids lean on. Some took great offence to it tbh. \n\nIt's also why I said. She needs a new trip to the therapist. And realise, it was HER dream. Not yours. And come to terms with things can be perfect. But it's just not the kind of perfect she wants. \nA happy marrige is perfect. And if she keeps pushing. She could loose it down the road."]}
