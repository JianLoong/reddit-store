He does this a bit to our toddler too, in the form of doing things like acting like he\u2019s going to give our son a hug, then pulling back.

We\u2019ve agreed previously that if I ask him to stop three times he will, and that has worked for a while. \n\nSo yesterday we happened by a pastry shop and I, having a huge sweet tooth, bought some kind of expensive pastries. I asked my husband multiple times if he wanted some and he said no. When we got home, I tried them and they were so good, and I told my husband to give them a try, which he did. This morning, he would not stop mentioning the pastries and how we should finish them before they go bad. He would then also say that he was going to finish them. At first I kind of blew him off and joked back like, no, don\u2019t eat my pastries! I picked them because I wanted to eat them. But he wouldn\u2019t stop saying he was going to finish them no matter how many times I asked him to, even when I told him he was stressing me out, even when I then got upset because he wouldn\u2019t stop. At that point, it wasn\u2019t about the pastries anymore. It was that I asked him to stop and he wouldn\u2019t, because he thought my reaction was funny. Then he got upset, like he was the victim, and said he didn\u2019t understand white people being so possessive and his family isn\u2019t like that (I\u2019m white and he\u2019s Korean). Then we got in a huge fight where he kept saying he couldn\u2019t believe I was getting so upset about pastries no matter how many times I told him I was upset he ignored my boundaries, and some nasty things were said on both sides.

To me, it seems like rather than trying really hard to be \"funny,\" he is being purposely cruel.\n\nI find it very hard to believe that he simply doesn't understand how much his \"jokes\" upset OP and their child. I think he understands perfectly well and that's exactly why he does it: because he enjoys causing them distress. That's beyond troubling. Not to mention the fact that OP has to ask him *three times* to stop before he does, and sometimes he won't stop even then. Sounds like he enjoys that too. \n\nPretending that this is just his \"sense of humor\" is his very weak attempt at excusing his bullying so he can continue it.", "/u/Commoninance is a bot that stole part of this comment: /r/AmItheAsshole/comments/122p4l8/aita_for_not_thinking_that_my_37f_husbands_34m/jdr4dc1/", "They were obviously out of will for a reason and they're either ashamed/guilty or withholding it from you because they believe it's not their fault.", "I am continually stunned by how men like this manage to sustain any relationships at all, let alone get married and have children with willing partners.", "Leave and stay with family for a couple days until he agree to personal and couples therapy", "It\u2019s not a therapy support group, it\u2019s AITA.
