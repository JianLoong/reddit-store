We don't want her marrying just anyone. These deviled eggs are so good - what did you put in them?\"", "NTA. oh my god OP they are so nosy! tell them to pound sand on the matter as it's NONE OF THEIR DAMN BUSINESS! if they keep getting nosy with you and start calling you about it just block their numbers. better yet go no contact with them", "NTA.

Also, it's weird to try to pressure someone into marriage and children when they've said they aren't ready for it, regardless of how good your reasoning is. Have you specifically asked them not to bring this up anymore? It shouldn't be necessary but maybe that would make them stop so that you can continue the relationship?

In the past I have tried and failed\n\nHere's some words that might help you to communicate where you are at to them.\n\n\"You're right. Every marriage is different. Some are marriages of two people who care for each other, support each other and actively communicate and work to keep their marriage strong and healthy. Others are marriages where one or both don't care for their partner, tear their partner down and generally disrespect the person they are with.\n\nIf I get married, I want it to be the first type of marriage. But right now, I do not know that I am ready or equipped to be that sort of partner in a relationship. That I have parts of myself that I need to work on. That I have past traumas that I need to overcome. So that, if I do meet the sort of someone that I want to be in a relationship with, that I will be able to be that sort of someone back to them.\n\nDo I need to be perfect? No. Nobody can be that.
