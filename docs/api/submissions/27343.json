Avoiding pests is sensible, and they are pests.\n\nThe problem might be that you troubled to explain your position to them. This is always a mistake. They don't care what your position is, because they want what they want and they're going to impose their will on you if they can.\n\nTelling them how you feel about marriage just gives them points to fight over.\n\nJust tell them no more discission, that if they bring it up even once more you will go NC on them. And then do it. It's the only way.", "NTA.\n\nAsk them why they are so interested or why it's their business, etc.  Ask them something that will cause them to pause and create an awkward silence.  Then, maybe they'll realize that they need to back off.", "NTA\n\nPressuring someone to get married and/or have children is a shitty thing to do. They need to respect your wishes on this.", "Visit but, if you make arrangements to see them, be clear, \"I would love to come and see you but if the topic of marriage is raised, I WILL leave. Are we clear?\"\n\nThey have a choice, respect your wishes or you leave and make them uncomfortable. You have made your boundary clear. The decision is theirs.", "NTA - but, here's where I think little white lies are handy when people ask you for more info than they're entitled to have or you're willing to give. If you'd just said \"When I meet the right guy, it will happen. Now how is so and so's baby doing? She is so cute.\" And repeat.\n\nAt this point, I might enlist the help of a relative. Tell them you want to come to the family gatherings, but you feel so uncomfortable that you've been staying away. They could help by cutting things off and changing the topic fir you. For example, you hang out near them at the gathering and the subject gets brought up - the relative pipes in first with \"throwra will get married when the times right. We don't want her marrying just anyone. These deviled eggs are so good - what did you put in them?\"", "NTA. oh my god OP they are so nosy! tell them to pound sand on the matter as it's NONE OF THEIR DAMN BUSINESS! if they keep getting nosy with you and start calling you about it just block their numbers. better yet go no contact with them", "NTA.

They see you as a means to increasing the family and little else. That's a sad state of affairs.", "NTA. 46f never married, no kids here. I be straight and tell them the constant inappropriate questions make you not want to spend time with them and if they care it needs to stop. I learnt a long time ago to stop being polite when people questioned my life choices (not say your being too polite). I used to say \"I've just not met the right man yet\" but that just led to \" have you met anyone yet?\" next time. I now say \" because I don't want to\" dead pan, while staring them in the eye. Usually works. If not the next time they ask they get \"I'm worried you may have dementia, because I've already answered this question. Do you forget other things?\" With a concerned face, before asking anyone else who's ever questioned me on the topic if they've noticed any memory problems. Two inappropriate nosey birds, one stone. Funnily enough I've not been asked in along time \ud83d\ude02", "YTA. It's shameful that you're avoiding your loving family because they want what's best for you. Your past trauma doesn't give you a free pass to shut them out. They come from a place of genuine concern, and you're responding with immaturity and ingratitude. Consider their perspective and engage in a respectful conversation about your reservations rather than hiding from your responsibilities.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe you can agree you will share when you are ready if you are ever in a committed relationship but until YOU choose to share they need to stop asking or you will not be attending family events and will leave if this boundary is not respected. Their focus should be that you are HAPPY, period. \n\nAlso wanted to share I come from an abusive home and am happily married with a child after being convinced I never get married and likely didn\u2019t want children. I\u2019m not saying the same will happen for you but I took years to heal and grow (some of those years alone and some with my partner) and found this is what I wanted.

I don't blame you one bit for not going.", "NTA. The fact of the matter is that their behavior is making you uncomfortable and you have every right to avoid things that make you uncomfortable. Also, it's weird to try to pressure someone into marriage and children when they've said they aren't ready for it, regardless of how good your reasoning is. Have you specifically asked them not to bring this up anymore? It shouldn't be necessary but maybe that would make them stop so that you can continue the relationship? And if it doesn't make it stop, then you know that they don't respect your boundaries and can respond however you see fit.", "NTA  But obviously you do not love being around them.

Heck, if you do end up getting married, don't invite them. Elope, and be happy. They don't deserve to be there for that. \n\nIt's OK to cut them out of your life completely. Love makes a family, not blood. \nLook for friends who actually treat you like family. Get out there and find the people who actually get you. \n\nIf you're old enough to marry, you are old enough to make your own decisions, and live your own life.", "The problem is they are so loving and caring that I hurt when they get hurt especially if I hurt them. But I need time maybe to explore a bit first maybe in faith or maybe explore the world before settling down and obviously an Intense therapy to heal myself for past trauma before settling which is a healthy way to life.

It's been a couple of years now so they have understood that my stance on marriage is fixed mainly because I dated one guy for a few years who turned out to be emotionally abusive. I didn't see it in the beginning because he was so good at making things my fault but after a while he stopped trying to sugar coat his words and became nasty with me. All of it has left a bitter taste in my life and I am just trying to heal. I am not ready to be open to dating, marriage, kids. But maybe in the distant future I might but that does not seem the case for me in the near future. I stopped lying ever since that time and have been completely honest with my feelings with everyone. After my sister's marriage, my break up, my intentions not to get married. My family's pressure for me to consider marriage became harder.", "I haven't avoided my responsibilities. I have fulfilled all my obligations and responsibilities always. Getting married isn't a responsibility it's a choice which I am not ready for in the near future. I did have a discussion about it.

Unfortunately, they do not care that they are hurting you.", "The way you are talking is sending vibes of \"keep pushing harder and she will cave\". No wonder they are this bad.

You have to shut them down or go nc for now.", ">my family's pov is that every marriage is different. I want the best way to communicate with them. In the past I have tried and failed\n\nHere's some words that might help you to communicate where you are at to them.\n\n\"You're right. Every marriage is different. Some are marriages of two people who care for each other, support each other and actively communicate and work to keep their marriage strong and healthy. Others are marriages where one or both don't care for their partner, tear their partner down and generally disrespect the person they are with.\n\nIf I get married, I want it to be the first type of marriage. But right now, I do not know that I am ready or equipped to be that sort of partner in a relationship. That I have parts of myself that I need to work on. That I have past traumas that I need to overcome. So that, if I do meet the sort of someone that I want to be in a relationship with, that I will be able to be that sort of someone back to them.\n\nDo I need to be perfect? No. Nobody can be that. But I know that I need to be in a different mental and emotional space than I am now. Until I've made more of the progress I want to make on myself, romantic relationships are off the table.\"\n\nIf you feel you need to work on yourself first, you are absolutely right to do so. If your extended family cannot comprehend that this is not where you are in life and won't back off, then putting some distance between you and them for a time may be your only good choice for changing the current dynamic.\n\nYou're NTA.", "That is for you to figure out.  NOT THEM!  \n\nThank them for their concern and that you will take their advice under consideration.  Keep telling them that.  Stop having the conversation.  All that does is give them points to argue.  Don't give them an in.", "Well that's just not true, my former roommate had her third kid at 41 and there were no complications with either her or her son. They're both perfectly healthy and very happy.", "I'm 32 and have to wait due to a condition that causes non-cancerous tumors to form on my liver. \n\nIf you do want to have biological children, you have more time than you think. The key word is if. If giving birth doesn't seem like your cup of tea but you want to have your own kids, adoption is a great choice. \nIf the thought of children and babies gives you the heebie jeebies, you don't have to have them. \n\n30 is not actually old. I feel like only cultures where people are expected to marry young and procreate before their frontal lobe fully develops (around age 25), think 30 is old. \n\nYou need to think about what YOU want your future to look like. Period.", "You're still being selfish. Your family is right; every experience is different. You can't base your entire future on your past trauma. Emotionally, you might not be ready, but that doesn't mean you should avoid discussing it with your family. They care about you, and you're shutting them out. Grow up and have a more open and respectful conversation about your concerns instead of running away from it.", "I\u2019m a boomer and pressuring anyone into a marriage& children is reprehensible.

That's not caring or kind & they certainly aren't respecting her wants.\n\nShe has every right to be fed up or tired of their nagging!", "Dumb*ss", "I didn't say all boomers... but definitely that guy.", "Tell them that you will consider getting married when you have fully dealt with the abuse you suffered as a child."]}
