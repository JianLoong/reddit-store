{"id": 5674, "submission_id": "zvldc5", "title": "AITA for not going on a date that I had never agreed to?", "selftext": "I've been talking to this guy for the past 2/3 weeks and everything was going fine. Last night he says that he has a surprise and I ask what it is and he says he won't tell me. So I ask for a hint and he says \"I'll see you up close and in person soon\". It's the middle of the Christmas season, and I have plans for the entire week. I have friends back from abroad, I have family members coming over, I've volunteering commitments to check on elderly people etc. So I say \"are you planning a date in the next while?\" To which he says no, he was going to video call me tomorrow and we could organise a date soon. I said that's a relief because I'm really caught up at the moment.\n\nSo on Christmas day, he then asks me what my plans are for tomorrow, and I say that I have family coming over to my place for dinner. He reads it at 7 am in the morning, and then at 8am I get a message that he's at a bus station and he's coming to see me. I saw this at 10 am and I messaged back immediately, and asked if he was on the bus. He said he was in my city already and he was waiting for me to wake up so I'd see his messages. \n\nI felt bad initially because he had come all the way down. I said I'd try to move a few things around but I couldn't guarantee anything. He then proceeded to tell me that he had booked a hotel for two nights and he'd be here for the next three days. I said there's no way I can meet him multiple times, I've plans that I have made literal months in advance, friends coming home from halfway across the world and dinners booked etc. \n\nThe more I think about it, the more annoyed I'm getting with the situation. So I sent him a message and I asked him why he still came down when I had said I was caught up for the next few days and I had also said, in a separate message, that I had plans with family tomorrow. At first, he said it was because he saw it at 4am and then I sent a screenshot of the message info that stated he saw it at 7am. Then he said \"oh yeah, around then\" and I replied, asking why then did he come all the way to my city when he was fully aware I had plans?\n\nHe said that he wanted to see me and he thought he could still see me somehow, even though I had plans.\n\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to see him at all now? I'll have to move multiple things around and probably cancel something I've planned months in advance just to see him. I've never met him before and although it's a sweet and thoughtful gesture, I can't help but feel like it's disrespectful to my boundaries? Whatever if he hadn't known that I had plans, but he very much did and acknowledges that. He's said now that he should've asked and I feel awful because he's spent all this money to come and see me, but at the same time I don't understand the reasoning.\n\nAm I the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1672054376, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvldc5/aita_for_not_going_on_a_date_that_i_had_never/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Run, my dude.", "Update: he's now messaged and said \"this might sound crazy but could visit you\" i.e in my home.\n\nThanks for the advice guys, the red flags are definitely there and it's very unsettling. I appreciate all of the advice, I think I'm going to just block him. I'm getting a bit freaked out.", "NTA\n\nSkip all the details.  This man \"decided\" for himself AND FOR YOU how you will be spending your time.  What can you possibly expect in the future.  This is red flag territory.  Run, run as fast as you can before he tells you that you're not allowed to run.", "NTA. i can\u2019t even imagine what went on in his head", "NTA, is he like this a lot? The surprise thing and disregard for your plans are pretty big red flags to me.", "NTA.  It's not sweet,  it's creepy and disrespectful. I would drop this relationship.", "NTA. He asked your plans and you told him that you would be busy for the next week, then he decided to show up anyhow to essentially try and brute force his way into your presence. That isn't someone I would really trust or be inclined to see", "NTA. Friend, you must be in Tiananmen Square, because you\u2019ve got red flags all around you. \n\nBest case scenario - he\u2019s an over-eager, socially inept weirdo who has trouble reading cues and thinks a fun first date is *Christmas.* Surprise! \n\nWorst case scenario - well, have you seen the movie \u201cRoom?\u201d\n\nJust because you texted him for three weeks does not mean you owe him anything.", "NTA- Block him and do not engage any further. Having been in a long very bad relationship.  This is screaming so many red flags.\n\nFirst of all it has been 2/3 weeks who travels and books a hotel that quickly it is weird.\n\nSecondly he is already pushing boundaries as you said at the start you were busy and he choose to ignore you and come anyway then lie about not actually knowing. \n\nYou have never met and he is already throwing out the worst red flags- do yourself a favour just move on and do not waste energy on engaging with him or being annoyed.", "You told him you had stuff going on and then he proceeded to essentially invite himself/try to force you to reprioritize your next couple of days. NTA", "NTA - that is so weeeeeeeeeeiiiiiiiiiiird!!!! No no no. I would freak out. \n\nDoesn't he have any dates over Christmas?!? Or did he cancel them for you?!? All super weird", "NTA. Like on the one hand maybe he thought he was being romantic and making a big gesture etc but you'd already clearly said that you were all booked up and had out-of-town family coming to visit and everything, and he's still gone and tried to make room for himself. Which is a huge overstep imo, attempted romantic gesture or not. \n\nAlso, you've been talking to him for just a couple of weeks. I'm gonna give him the benefit of the doubt and say he's been watching too many romance movies, and thought he was making a Grand Gesture but also, like. Buddy. Two weeks. That's a bit intense my guy.", "NTA & a big red flag. You told him that you weren't available & he still showed up (without you agreeing first I might add) & expected you to drop something(s) to meet him. & for the very first time which makes it even weirder imo.\n\nThis would set my radar off & I'd be done with this relationship. 2/3 weeks is fast for him to be acting like this, too. If you do meet him DON'T do it alone & make sure it's in public. He could be naive about things, but it's giving me a bad vibe. It's his fault he's wasted his time & money. Don't let him guilt you into meeting due to him not listening & doing what he wanted instead.", "NTA at all, please don't even go meet him once, this whole thing is creeping me out!", "NTA. I also see some red flags here. Watch your step with this fellow.", "NTA and a bit of a red flag on his part. Who does that in the middle of the holiday season? This isn't a hallmark movie, you've got so much on your plate already.", "NTA - major red flags. I wouldn\u2019t meet up with him if I were you. He has no respect for your time or boundaries. If he\u2019s doing this before you\u2019ve even met, imagine what it could be like a year down the line.", "No dear God stay away from him. That's creepy, rude and you better bet that behavior will not stop after the first date. NTA 1000%", "NTA . Massive massive red flag . If over the next few weeks you need to leave home make sure someone is around you .\nThis person seems like a stalker and nothing good can come interacting with them further .\nBetter to over react in this situation then not . This is not normal from them .", "NTA. This dude is desperate, which is creepy and can be dangerous. If he did this just after 3 weeks of talking, imagine how it can evolve after a couple of months. As others have said, this dude screams red flag and you need to break in case of emergency.", "NTA. This is terrifying. Men think things like this are romantic gestures, but it\u2019s creepy predatory behavior.", "He's proven that your wants and needs are not important, only his wants and needs are important.  Run.  NTA  He is just another entitled male who thinks only of himself.", "NTA - not your fault at all.", "Definitely NTA. I would be so pissed about the situation that I would end things with him and never go on that date. He's pushing your boundaries and guilt tripping you to see him. I wouldn't want anything to do with such manipulative person.", "NTA. is he living in a romcom, if so then his actions are justified and reasonable.", "NTA at all! Super glad you've blocked him. This could have gone so wrong. What a creep.", "NTA he\u2019s obsessive and disrespectful of boundaries I\u2019m just glad you posted this so it could be made clear to you before he was able to be in your physical proximity", "NTA.\nIt's a big red flag that, after such a small amount of time talking, this person who is effectively a stranger decided to travel down to 'see you' without so much as checking if that's what you wanted. \n\nIt absolutely is disrespectful of your boundaries. Beware of people who try to force their way into your life. If they're meant to be there, it will be natural and organic.", "NTA\n\nThis is really red-flag behavior. You keep telling him no and he keeps ignoring your boundaries. He has no empathy at all for the position he's put you in and doesn't care about your needs. He's only focused on what he wants. Bad people use our desire to be nice to get what they want.\n\nDoes he know your address? If so prepare yourself for the possibility that he might just show up. If he doesn't don't tell him. I have a bad feeling he doesn't take rejection well.\n\nBe safe.", "This smells seriously like a man who doesn\u2019t understand consent. It\u2019s quite creepy.

Red Flags the size of planets should be waving in your head.

Neither are a great look", "Good for you!

There are some really odd people out there and  it can be scary.  Sounds like you are safe which is a relief!", "That's true, I told him that I wouldn't be able to meet him today anyway, so I think I'm going to just try to distance myself", "I will do! I've sent the info to my friends and family", "That's so true! Thank you so much, it's much appreciated"]}
