Last night he says that he has a surprise and I ask what it is and he says he won't tell me. So I ask for a hint and he says \"I'll see you up close and in person soon\". It's the middle of the Christmas season, and I have plans for the entire week. I have friends back from abroad, I have family members coming over, I've volunteering commitments to check on elderly people etc. So I say \"are you planning a date in the next while?\" To which he says no, he was going to video call me tomorrow and we could organise a date soon. I said that's a relief because I'm really caught up at the moment.\n\nSo on Christmas day, he then asks me what my plans are for tomorrow, and I say that I have family coming over to my place for dinner. He reads it at 7 am in the morning, and then at 8am I get a message that he's at a bus station and he's coming to see me. I saw this at 10 am and I messaged back immediately, and asked if he was on the bus. He said he was in my city already and he was waiting for me to wake up so I'd see his messages. \n\nI felt bad initially because he had come all the way down. I said I'd try to move a few things around but I couldn't guarantee anything. He then proceeded to tell me that he had booked a hotel for two nights and he'd be here for the next three days. I said there's no way I can meet him multiple times, I've plans that I have made literal months in advance, friends coming home from halfway across the world and dinners booked etc. \n\nThe more I think about it, the more annoyed I'm getting with the situation. So I sent him a message and I asked him why he still came down when I had said I was caught up for the next few days and I had also said, in a separate message, that I had plans with family tomorrow. At first, he said it was because he saw it at 4am and then I sent a screenshot of the message info that stated he saw it at 7am. Then he said \"oh yeah, around then\" and I replied, asking why then did he come all the way to my city when he was fully aware I had plans?\n\nHe said that he wanted to see me and he thought he could still see me somehow, even though I had plans.\n\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to see him at all now? I'll have to move multiple things around and probably cancel something I've planned months in advance just to see him. I've never met him before and although it's a sweet and thoughtful gesture, I can't help but feel like it's disrespectful to my boundaries? Whatever if he hadn't known that I had plans, but he very much did and acknowledges that. He's said now that he should've asked and I feel awful because he's spent all this money to come and see me, but at the same time I don't understand the reasoning.\n\nAm I the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1672054376, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvldc5/aita_for_not_going_on_a_date_that_i_had_never/", "score": 221, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s not innocent. It\u2019s manipulative the way he\u2019s gone about it. \n\nHe\u2019s using \u201coh but I made effort and came all this way\u201d as a manipulation tactic and it was almost going to work. Don\u2019t feel bad. He chose to not confirm a proper date and to just show up in your city like a creepy stalker. (And he will evolve to that).", "It's not just that, he wants to make the 1st date something special, that's why he wants it to be on Christmas. He thinks he's a romantic but doesn't realize that he's living in lala land, out of touch with reality, and borderline creepy. Like who does a 1st date on Christmas when it's a family holiday.", "Because you can maybe explain it by being an overly romantic teenager but in your late 20s that\u2019s a weird thing to do. \n\nDoes he have a car? Why would he take the bus when it\u2019s only 2 hours. So he either has no car but spent money on a hotel to see a girl he doesn\u2019t know (extra dumb) or is playing some weird guilt trip game by adding a bus trip.", "I totally get where you're coming from! I live a 4 hour plane ride away from my friends and family. Whenever I visit it's always a juggling act to try and see as many people as I can. Your time is yours to spend with those you choose and it's arguably one of the most precious things we have.", "And then I see in the comments he pushed to come to your house? Oh hell no.", "From the description of the behaviour, I imagined he was a teenager   \n\n\nHe's either a naive dummy who's watched too many movies or a creep - no point taking any chances", "I'm so glad to see you blocked him. I had a similar experience with someone I met online and he just wouldn't stop, I finally blocked him and he used my phone number to find me on other SM platforms, when I didn't respond he then used my name to find family members and messaged my younger sister saying he was a close friend and was worried he couldn't get in touch with me. I hope this guy takes the hint.", "Thank you, I appreciate that a lot. He asked me if he could visit me in my home and I told him no and blocked him immediately!", "Thank you so much, this was honestly so insightful and helpful. I've just had a look at that sub and there are definitely a lot of common threads. I really appreciate your words and your advice!", "Yeah that's very true! And I had spoken about my family and how close I am with them too", "It is definitely odd. He doesn't no, he had said that before though. I just don't understand why he would just decide that without consulting me, especially when he knew I was busy. It's just an even more stressful day than it already was going to be", "Thank you so much! And yeah for sure, it's always a rush trying to fit everybody in. You're so right, time is very precious!", "Yep! After I said I was stressed out now and I couldn't move anything around for him he said \"this might sound crazy but I could visit you\" I.E my home. I freaked out at that part alrighty and blocked him immediately.", "I get that, I don't blame you for thinking he was younger. That's why I was a bit confused by it too, I'm 24!", "Best to keep it that way.  Stay safe OP \nNTA", "That's absolutely terrifying, honestly. I hope you got it sorted in the end!", "Good, this guy is off his rocker", "I\u2019m a bit silly with men, it\u2019s taken me a long time to notice things and figure it out. I\u2019m 29 now and with the most incredible and amazing man. But I was in your shoes once. Gave guys a chance because they were \u201cnice\u201d. \n\nNice is the bare minimum a human being should be offering anyway. If all a guy has to say about himself is that he\u2019s a nice guy, I can promise you that he is not a nice guy at all. \n\nAnother to look at, and it may be vulgar to say; watch how the man you\u2019re interested in treats women he doesn\u2019t want to fuck. Ie retail or waitresses. Especially women in roles he views as lesser. If he\u2019s rude, dismissive, arrogant or degrading, I can tell you now that\u2019s how he is in general, he\u2019s just playing his cards right till the woman he wants/is sleeping with is too deep in his bullshit to leave.", "I\u2019m certain you\u2019re a beautiful and intelligent human with a lot to give the right person. Which in turn means you deserve a wonderful human to care for you also. Don\u2019t settle!", "Probably wanted to guilt you into seeing him. You did the right thing cutting it off. I can\u2019t imagine if you even saw him and gave credence to his actions. He gives a lot of creep vibes.", "Nope haha 3 years later and he's still blocked on my phone and SM, I told my sister to block him. But I still can see when a blocked number texts or calls, and he still is every few months trying to reach me. Even making accounts on others SM to find me.", "I am inclined to agree", "Thank you so much for your advice, I really appreciate it. That's a really good tip actually! It's lovely to hear that you found your man too!!", "Thank you, that's very sweet!", "Thank you so much!!", "That's actually insane! People are so strange, I don't understand it", "They really are and like your other response to my comment a second ago, when I told him I was busy he kept suggesting he come to my house. I noped out big time.", "Yep! That was when alarm bells went off in my head", "Definitely. I hope blocking him works. Stay safe and happy holidays."]}
