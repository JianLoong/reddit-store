Out of them all, this one home security company has been the most obnoxious. The house has one of their systems already and I guess they have a subscription where they'll call the cops for you if it goes off, which honestly sounds like the opposite of a feature for me so I literally told the first salesman \"Have you met cops? Like you're telling me I could have a man show up 3 hours after my house was robbed asking me if I was asking for it? Yeah no..\" \n\nI thought that woulda been the last conversation but 4 more times that week, they sent salesmen to the door. I stopped opening it. \n\nAnd the last one, I actually opened the door because I had ordered a pizza and thought it was the delivery driver. Nope, ADT again, and it was like 7:30 at night, it had been dark for hours, and I was home alone. It honestly was starting to feel kinda creepy. \n\nThe guy asked me if he could come in and talk to me about security system options, and I ended up getting snappy and said \"For fucks sake, the only people making me think I'd even need security is y'all? How the hell are you in this line of work and you think it's OK to show up at a chick's house at night, hours after dark, uninvited, and try to come in?\" Over and over again too, no means no man... \n\nThe guy was like \"we could talk on the porch of you're more comfortable\" and I was like \"No, you're missing the fuckin point.\n\nHe said he was just doing his job and my household had \"expressed interest\". I said I own the damn house, and for fucks sake stop showing up uninvited to people's houses, it's creepy. \n\nMy boyfriend had heard this exchange, he'd been staying over, and he came up like \"is there any trouble\" \n\nAnd get this... The salesman was like \"Are you the husband?\" As if he was just gonna try his pitch on him. I said \"No he's not, I'm the homeowner, get the hell out\"\n\nHe left and my boyfriend was like \"What was that about\"\n\nI told him how this was the same company I'd already said no to, and now they're showing up in the night? \n\nHe was like \"it's only 7:30\" and I was like \"Only\"?\"\n\nHe told me that honestly in a neighborhood, people are going to come to your door uninvited, it's not like the city.\n\nI said literally nobody does that, it's basic etiquette to ask if you want to come by! Like literally everyone I know will text or call first. \n\nHe said it was literally normal, that's how sales works, and I'd know if I ever lived in a \"friendly neighborhood\" \n\nI felt kinda insulted by that, my last few places were super friendly, even if they weren't suburban \n\nAITA for what I said to the salesman?", "created_utc": 1668530478, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yw2hfw/aita_for_telling_the_home_security_salesman_that/", "score": 109, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What does it matter if it\u2019s a friendly neighborhood- they clearly don\u2019t have friendly intentions.\n\nWhy is your bf more defensive of some random salesmen then you? It literally costs him nothing to just support you in this situation. Honestly he comes off as condescending and inconsiderate.", "NTA. Honestly I'd contact ADT and send them a link to this conversation. \n\nPlease be careful. Even if you are expecting a pizza, don't open the door. Get a security latch and talk through the gap to see who it is first. A friend of my mom was savagely raped and beaten. She opened the door because she thought the knock was from someone else.", "NTA. Your instincts were right, and he\u2019s being creepy. He doesn\u2019t need to come over,\nUnless you have an appointment, and especially not at 7:30 at night. I would have gotten his name and called his supervisor.", "NTA. Is that the official advice of the home security company I wonder. \"Invite strange men into your house, especially when you're living alone, especially after dark.\" I'd look into what legal action I could take to stop them from coming over to be honest.", "NTA, honestly if I were you I'd get a different security system and make damn sure they learned it was this salesman specifically that lost them your business going forward", "Check your city ordinances and see what the rules are for solicitors.  In our city, we can pay the city $15 for a non-solicitation sign and you can report sales people to the city if they violate it.  If they get repeated violations, the city will suspend their permit.\n\nWhen I have solicitors come to my door and I do open it - I just point to the sign and rarely even say a word - they just turn around and walk off. Some try to engage, but I remind them that no solicitation means NO SOLICITATION.\n\nMy husband will ask to see their permit if he thinks they don't have permits.  He has also called the non-emergency number on a few of them, because we have one vendor (window replacements) that lost their permit, but they still send out people en masse.  They figure it is cheaper to pay the fine if they can get even one sale.  Funnily enough, more than once, my husband has seen the door-to-door person getting picked up very quickly after he asks for the permit - they get out of the neighborhood before the cops show up.\n\nNTA.\n\nPS to say if you don't have city ordinances, find out who your city council rep is and talk to them about putting them in.  After dark sales calls are just creepy.", "NTA. Once you told this guy no, he had no business coming back to try again. Lodge a complaint with the company he works for and stop opening your door before looking to see who is on your step.", "NTA\n\n>The house has one of their systems already and I guess they have a subscription where they'll call the cops for you if it goes off, which honestly sounds like the opposite of a feature for me so I literally told the first salesman \"Have you met cops?

Yeah no..\"\n\nMaybe you should have them remove the existing system, get yourself a security camera for your front door, and report the sales people showing up at your door to the company?", "So your bf is right - door-to-door solicitation is a thing, and municipalities tend to have acceptable hours for this. 7.30pm is probably within them.\n\nFeel free to post a \"strictly no solicitors\" sign on your door. In most places, they're obliged to respect that.\n\nNTA", "NTA I thought your BF called them without you knowing. 4 times in one week is odd. Sometimes if a service does work on a few houses in the neighborhood they will come by because they ask every neighbor. I've had it happen twice in one week but never 4.\n\nI would say 7:30 isn't weird especially in summer. Kind of like how Telemarketers uses to call between 5-8 pm in the 90s, that's when people are home.\n\nMoving into a new place tons of places get your name and address. Mostly local businesses. Sometimes addressed to resident sometimes addressed to you because addresses are public information. \n\nThat aside you don't want the service and you said no. If the issue is someone is still paying the subscription on the house, like the owner hasn't stopped paying they wouldn't need to come to you.", "NTA.  You understand it perfectly already so nothing to add.", "NTA.  Unless the salespeople have gotten more brazen since the last time I lived in a stand-alone home on a quiet suburban street\u2026no, it\u2019s not normal for people to come bother you during what could reasonably be assumed to be dinner or put the very young children to bed time.  It\u2019s certainly not acceptable for this company to not be passing along your lack of interest to these salespeople, or for them to keep trying to drag out the conversation after you\u2019ve made it clear there\u2019s no sale here and they\u2019re wasting their time.  Put up some \u201cno trespassing/solicitors\u201d signs, make liberal use of your door chain or just ignore knocks if you\u2019re not expecting company, and keep bugging ADT yourself until you figure out who you need to talk to for this to stop.", "nta, yes its how sales work BUT after the first couple nos, they should not be coming back. Sounds like there are several companies and they keep coming back, I believe this is harassment and potentially prosecutional. If you get a \"NO SOLICITING\" sign and \"Trespassers will be persecuted\" that might help. Send a letter, maybe even notarize so you can say you did it, to the various security companies detailing their harassment and warn them to not come back. All seems a bit extreme I know but it might help put the fear of god in the companies.", "A bit of both. Expect it to happen. They aren\u2019t going to call or text you to \u201ccome by\u201d they will just show up. That\u2019s how door to door sales has worked since it became a thing. \n\nAnother example is Jehovah\u2019s witnesses, they will come by and it\u2019s literally a joke across North America about it, they don\u2019t call or text, they just show up, you say you\u2019re not interested and close the door.", "Nta !!! He's a creep. Stay safe", "NTA - OMG, this happened to my husband and me right after we bought our first house. One of the guys literally told us it wasn\u2019t a matter of \u201cif\u201d our house would be broken into but \u201cwhen.\u201d \n\nAfter I very thoroughly told off one of these guys, he saw my husband working in the backyard and called out to him, \u201chey are you the husband.\u201d My husband told him to leave, but I felt incredibly disrespected. Clearly, they\u2019re taught that it\u2019s not a real no unless it comes from a man.", "NTA - for what you said to the salesman.  What they were trying to do was a hard sale.  They would keep pushing you until you gave in.  Obviously that plan backfired on them.  Get a Ring Camera and record them so you can report them.  On a side note, your BF does have a point.  Living in a neighborhood is completely the opposite of living in an urban setting.  \n\n*He told me that honestly in a neighborhood, people are going to come to your door uninvited, it's not like the city.*\n\nNeighbors will come by unannounced to maybe ask to borrow something or invite you to something.\n\n*I said literally nobody does that, it's basic etiquette to ask if you want to come by!*\n\nEveryone does that.  You're not in the city anymore.  This is suburban life.", "NTA. I live in a \"friendly\" suburban neighborhood, and I've gotten maybe three uninvited sales visits in the past year, none of them after dark. I second the suggestion to let the company know of your displeasure. Salesmen who pull the \"just doing my job\" part when they get called out for being obnoxious are the worst.", "We had ADT put in a system and it was the worst mistake.  We kept setting it off by accident, it would go off for no reason and once went off during the night and we couldn\u2019t shut it off.  And just like car alarms, no one pays any attention.  Our neighborhood was new, back in the day, and you would hear alarms go off everyday.  Now, no one has them.\n\nYou\u2019re better off with security cameras.", "I would write a letter to ADT telling them to stay off my property and stating that if any of their employees trespassed on my property again, I would take all appropriate legal action. Send it by U.S. mail certified and address it to the manager of their local office. Then call your police department's non-emergency number and ask their advice for getting someone \"trespassed\" from your property, so that you know the procedure if your letter is ignored. You are certainly NTA for asserting your right to peace and security in your own home.", "NTA\n\nGet their names, times of visits, and some door mace. Be ready to fight back.\n\nA friend of mine had a lawn company spray pesticide in her butterfly garden, killing all the butterflies she was raising and they tried to charge her for it. She had to sue them to get them to leave her alone. Women homeowners get extra harassment.", "NTA.\n\nYou're not the asshole for being frustrated with this situation. I would be too. \n\nBut your boyfriend is a bit correct in that it is relatively normal for door to door sales people to come around giving pitches, especially in the late afternoon/evening when people are more likely to be home. \n\nYour best bet is to call the company and let them know you'd like to be taken off their list of interested households and put up a \"No Soliciting\" sign in your yard/on your door.", "NTA - Yeah it's obnoxious. I put up a No Soliciting sign that seems to stop most of them. If they ignore the sign I don't answer the door or I open it, point to the sign, and say that I'm not interested and close the door", "NTA. Yeah, that's creepy.", "NTA. Lived in a neighborhood my whole life and the only people to show up at your door uninvited are not people I want to open it for. Ever. It does happen, unfortunately, but not as often as seems to be happening for you. Idk if it\u2019s your particular neighborhood or because you are new and thus have become a target. I would look up laws in your city about solicitation. It\u2019s really weird he has come back 4 times. In my city they legally have to leave you alone once you\u2019ve said no, so I\u2019d check to see if there is anyth8ng you can do to report them. At the least since you know his company you could call and complain how he continues after you have told him his visiting makes you uncomfortable. My advice, if someone rings your doorbell and you haven\u2019t ordered food or invited anyone don\u2019t open the door. I got caught by Jehovah\u2019s Witness this past weekend because I didn\u2019t check and thought it was a package. \ud83d\ude43", "NTA. I worked for ADT for a month right out of college and quit because of the pushiness, some salesmen were so pushy to the point cops were actually called.", "NTA. Everyone has the right to privacy in their own home . With that said, you need to be a little more careful with the information you give up. You shouldn\u2019t have told the salesman that your bf isn\u2019t your husband and that you are the homeowner. They don\u2019t need to know any of that. Don\u2019t give ANY of your home security info to anyone that shows up at your door.", "All of my experiences with home security sales people have been super creepy. NTA.", "NTA You didn't greet him at the door with rudeness. You only reacted after he didn't respect your \"no.\" It is true that in neighborhoods people do ring doorbells and knock on doors without notice. So you need to prepare yourself for that with the knowledge that it is not seen as rude. It is actually neighborly. I just moved into a new house and several neighbors have knocked on my door bringing wine and cheese and chocolate. So maybe you would do well to answer the door in the future with fresh eyes, but what you said to the salesman was totally justified.", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend is right in that there will be salesman that come to your door.  Usually its alarm companies or cable/phone companies, or landscape companies\n\nBut in most cases, they hit your house, leave a leaflet on the door if nobody answers, and then don't come back\n\nThis guy is coming back to your house for a reason. \n\nIt may not be a nefarious reason, but there is a reason\n\nI would reach out to ADT customer service about this.\n\nI would also get a doorbell camera.  That way you can talk to people through the 2 way communicator and let them know you are unavailable to open the door and that you aren't interested in what they are selling\n\nYou will have to deal with this more than you think...but I've been a homeowner for almost 20 years and I have never had the same salesman come to my house multiple times.  \n\nThey move on to the next and don't waste time with return visits\n\nSo like I said...this seems a bit shady to me", "NTA. Your boyfriend really needs to pull his head out of his ass and see things from a woman's POV. It is absolutely not normal and totally sus for people that aren't family & friends to show up, uninvited, well after dark. I lived in the 'burbs for years and never knew a salesperson to show up after 5 p.m. for any reason.", "NTA.  I\u2019d never hire any business that goes door to door.  If you\u2019re good at what you do you\u2019ll be busy and don\u2019t need to look for customers.  They sound like scammers or worse. Maybe get a doorbell camera for security.", "No. Absolutely NTA. 7 30 at night for an unsolicited visit is not normal. And I love the fact you pointed out that the company themselves were the only reason you were starting to feel like you needed security.", "NTA put up a no solicitors sign, then call the cops if they show up again for trespassing. Don\u2019t even open the door. Also a ring doorbell or any other camera one is a great investment for a home.", "NTA. Definitely though stop just throwing open the door without ascertaining who is out there.  I had the same thought you expressed\u2026..you need security FROM these people, not from these people\u2026.sheesh", "NTA\n\nI suggest you try calling and speaking to a manager. You've already said no several times and it is now bordering on harassment. Also, I suggest getting a ring doorbell of sorts so you don't have to open the door to speak to someone. I would also get a not soliciting sign as well.", "NTA. I had similar things happen a lot when I first bought my house and no one seems to take no for an answer so I just started peeping through the window first and not answering if I didn't recognize the person. If they really need you and it's not a salesman bs tactic they can leave a note.", "NTA. I bought vinyl lettering that says \u201cNo Soliciting\u201d for my front door and now I don\u2019t have unwanted salespeople showing up.", "NTA, sales people can F off. Answer the door holding a gun next time. I do this at my house when solicitors are going around, they never come back.", "NTA I would invest in at least a video door bell.", "NTA - I hate door to door salesmen, I have a \"No Soliciting\" sign on my door, a solar salesman knocked on the door, I opened the door and pointed to the sign, did you not see this? He replied, yea, but I can save you money......I responded, you are now trespassing, leave.....", "NTA. Also id have another talk with your bf and ask why he feels the need to defend this stranger who showed up at your house at night rather than you. This would make me have mother look at the relationship tbh. I live in a neighborhood, if anything theres less people knocking on your door than a city and they never disturb you when its dark. Which btw completely nulls your bf comment about it only being 7:30pm. Its is dark.. thats when crimes multiply\u2026 doesnt matter if its 7pm, midnight or 5 in the morning. Not to mention the fact that the salesman ignored you once he saw your bf and attempted to sell to him instead", "NTA this is practically harassment. Contact the Head Office of the company by letter and tell them in no uncertain terms that you have *not* expressed any interest in availing of their service and you'll call the cops yourself if they come to your door again. Follow up with a phone call after a week to confirm that they received the letter.\n\nThis isn't 'friendly neighbourhood' stuff, it's cold calling harassment stuff. I can't fathom what your bf is thinking. Maybe he feels a little put out that you announced that he's not the 'man of the house'?", "NTA and heaven forbid you do actually get broken into. They will come to your door with the police report about your break in and try to scare you into a contract. Which unfortunately worked in our case because we had young children but never again.  The last time I had a guy come to the door (in a new state) I had to squeeze out on the porch due to my dogs ferocious barking. He tried his pitch and I raised my eyebrows and said, you wanna try breaking into my house with that on the other side? He kind of shrugged sheepishly and moved on.", "NTA.  My mom was murdered for opening the door when she thought it was someone else.", "NTA for being upset with them coming over and over, but door to door salespeople are indeed quite common so that part isn't actually weird (except to someone who isn't used to them heh)", "NTA. I've had this happen to me and I couldn't get the guy to leave, and I was way too nice. I've upped my asshole game since then.", "NTA, 7:30pm is too late for this salesman to be knocking.", "NTA.  I'm in the exact same sitch and react the same way! Someone knocks, my dogs become hell hounds and channel Cujo, and my anxiety jumps through the roof.  \n\n I have a no soliciting sign and doormat in my etsy cart that I'm holding off on buying in case someone gets me the for a Christmas present.", "NTA. That's creepy and aggressive.  Call the security company and complain,  make sure you mention he tried to invite himself in. Might want to share it in yelp and Google.  Also put up some no trespassing signs too", "NTA.\n\nSince Covid door to door salespeople have dropped way down, but we used to get a lot.   I started opening the door with my son's snake around my wrist, or a cooking knife in hand and apron on.", "NTA, you were a bit rude but i think it was justified as you had turned the company down multiple times already. That said, your bf is correct that door to door sales is a thing. I suggest you put up a prominent \"no soliciting\" sign and then stop opening the door for anyone you don't expect to be there.", "NTA, especially since you've already given them multiple polite refusals.\n\nAnd ftr, I live in a friendly neighborhood and get maybe 2-3 unsolicited door-knocks a YEAR (not counting Girl Scouts selling cookies). \n\nYour BF is way off base, and should have had your back better.", "NTA\n\nBut go watch some movies with salesmen.. (there is a good one with the McDonald's brothers), it's how they are, it's how the job is: shit.\n\nLiterally their job is to show to people's door uninvited, hope for a discussion, convince you to buy something. Anything, as long as they make a sale. Many get payed on commission. No sales, no money..  \n\nClearly not your fault, but next time just answer the door quickly, say \"sorry, not interested\", then close. 10 seconds chat. He'll get the point after a few attempts.\n\nBesides, this is a skill you need to grow. It will keep happening.", "NTA but the only person who will suffer if you get stressed out about this is you.

It's normal for sales people to show up sometimes and during the day, but it's never normal for it to be literally at night with no sunlight out or daily. \n\nComing to your house several times a week is not normal, not even remotely. \n\nNTA Get a camera so you don't accidentally open the door to unwanted company and get a no soliciting sign.\n\nAnd your boyfriend shouldn't be defending someone who comes by several times a week. It costs him nothing to defend you so why is he failing to?", "1) Most cops are decent people and want to serve the community, not all, most.

If there is an active break-in situation, it wont be 3 hours later it'll be an immediate response to check on things.\n\n2) It is Door to Door sales. They are going to show up unannounced. That is their job.\n\n3) They are going to assume if two people are in the same house that they are in a marital relationship. Generally that is the case, not always.\n\n4) In most areas, they are allowed to keep going door to door until 8 or 9 local time.\n\nNTA for your sentiment of it being rude.

Tell them you have a contract with another company due to their harassment and to be put on the do not call list.  Then go install a ring doorbell.", "ESH. You took your anger out on an easy target, a guy who's trying do his job and can't talk back to you the way you did to him. He didn't want to be at your door at 7:30 any more than you did and he definitely doesn't deserve to be treated as a potential criminal for doing his job. So you're the A for that \n\nThe company is also the A for sending salesmen nonstop. Consider calling them and telling them to take you off the list instead of being snarky at the salesmen about \"cops bad\". That was cringe", "I have called a number of times, they either hang up on me when they hear I'm not interested in buying, or tell me the sales department can help. \n\nThen transfer me to sales, who can't help, and tries to upsell me. \n\nClosest I've got was a guy who told me they don't have a do-not-contact list for door to door sales... Which, how tf does a company not have that? Like literally since you have a file on me just write in it to stop coming to my house all the damn time. \n\nTangent but if anyone knows a number for ADT that doesn't lead back to the sales department in the end, please lemme know.\n\nAnd thanks for the safety tip, you're so right. Sorry to hear about your mom's friend, that's horrible", "Holy shit. I hope your mom\u2019s friend is doing okay. That\u2019s horrific", "I don't need the existing systems removed, without the subscription it works fine as a local security system to alert me. \n\nI called the company and they briefly apologized... Then tried a sales pitch lol. I feel like all roads end in sales tbh.", "Afternoon isn't that weird, but at night? Multiple hours after dark? To a house a woman owns on her own??? That's fuckin creepy.", "Fyi, OP- Those \"No Soliciting\" signs don't necessarily help. We have them throughout our community, but we still have people who ignore them.\n\nI had trouble with a vacuum salesman once, different state/different house. I was polite when I declined, and he took that to mean he should keep coming back to bother me. My husband chased them- he brought a manager to really make that sale- off one night (yes, night). They never came back. \n\nI don't blame you one bit. You had already told them no, and they weren't leaving you alone.", "Honestly not the cops, they're worse then useless around here and I'm not trying to make shit worse\n\nGenuine answer, the insurance company, and a friend so I could sleep somewhere safe.", "I literally didn't know that was still a thing, I've lived in the area for yearrrs and never heard of it. I thought that was like a scam left in the 1950s, some dude showing up bullying you into buying some knifes or some shit.", "1. We might live in very different areas... \n\n2. It's a creepy ass job\n\n3. For fucks sake have they heard of friends? Or dating? \n\n4. Again, creepy", "There are set business hours. If you are soliciting outside, its no & go, not let me try and convince you, or dismiss you and try and talk over you; to your husband instead - which is insane in ANY sales experience. Especially when people are specified for you to leave. already has a system in place. She told 4 different people from the same company no. Ops NTA but the salesforce/marketing team is.", "Like hours after dark? To a house they know a girl owns alone? And starts with showing up uninvited asking to be invited in? \n\nThe context being that they work in HOME SECURITY? You'd think of any profession, they might stop to think that might be a creepy ass idea...", "Oh I said that to the first call... And the second call... And the third. \n\nI was getting fed up when it was getting to the 4th 5th and 6th no and they were only getting pushier.", "She told him no, and he wouldn't accept that. He showed up at her home, where she has a right to privacy,  and he wouldn't accept being turned away. How does that make her an ah? BTW there are a lot of people out there who have bad intentions and pretend to be someone they are not. Better safe than sorry. \nNTA", "I've owned my home for over a year and never head a single door to door sales man show up. On top of that I lived in rented houses for 4 years prior and have had them show up 1x in those 4 years...  this is not part and parcel of living in a house.", "You'd think a Security company would have the sense to not show up creepily at night tho? \n\n> I'm also a little confused why you think the cops are going to show up three hours later and accuse you of asking for... a house break in.\n\nIt's called a joke. I was poking fun at the ways cops behaved any time I or people in my community called them.", "Just get a no soliciting sign for your yard near your door.", "Send a cease and desist.  \n\nNta but get a camera and interphon  so you don't  need to open the door and record who it is if necessary.", "ADT was extremely pushy when we bought our house too. Other than a friendly neighbor who wanted to exchange numbers and give us the trash/recycling schedule, they were the only ones who showed up unsolicited. \n\nThey showed up like 4 times even though we didn\u2019t want their services and told them. My husband even called and said we weren\u2019t gonna go with them, we already have security. \n\nThey showed up the next day and said they were here for the installation appointment and that the homeowner approved it. Like what??", "Report them to local business authority? They sound pretty predatory and the last thing a security company should want is a reputation for causing the threat...", "My house had an existing system when I bought it but we did get it updated. But since I have been working remotely since the panini started and will continue to for the foreseeable future, we decided to cancel the subscription. Prices were going up and we don\u2019t set the alarm when we are home. The reps were not taking a simple no cancel our subscription. The one had the nerve to ask who would call the cops when the alarm goes off, umm \u2026.. me cause im home. Plus our 2 dogs are barkers when they see anyone outside. Besides we always had communication issues with the system that we had to unplug and reset every few months. Overpriced crap service. \n\nTry to remove any stickers or signs on the windows or outside. If they show up again threaten to report to the police for harassment. I got a lot more door to door sales people since panini started, mainly home repairs or solar. But even they take a simple no thanks. Possibly take a photo of the sales person too for evidence", "Well first off, they're not going to know that a woman owns the home. They just know that its a home with someone who lives there. \n\nAnd 7:30 at night is not uncommon. I have people coming around my place offering new internet packages around that time. \n\nI understand why you think its creepy and it can definitely feel that way but its really not uncommon.", "That's when you start making loud Dennis Radar comments. Cause seriously they need to forever lean generously to the other side of the line of creepy.", "Cops rarely solve break-ins. They just take a report for insurance purposes and if they run across your items being fenced as part of a different investigation, you might get your items back. Maybe.\n\n\nI had a break in. It was clearly kids. They tried to take all my alcohol w/ other items but it was too heavy to carry. The cops took all my alcohol bottles for fingerprints. They weren't stolen so they weren't on the police report for my insurance claim When I called the number to get my  booze back, it was nowhere to be found and no prints were taken for the case. So I was out hundreds of dollars in booze and no insurance to cover it.", "Sounds like your house will be ripe for the stealing. Robbing with no consequences? Where you at and  what size tv do you have?", "Like I said, you're pretty naive.", "1) We probably do but the statistics are probably similar. Most are still decent people and it's the vocal minority causing the problem.\n\n2) It's a job like any other.\n\n3) It's part of the job to make educated guesses. They are not always right.\n\n4) Again, it's a job.", "I don't understand why you're so fixated on people being afraid to knock on your door because (gasp) a girl owns the house! Maybe they're not being sexist, and assume you are a capable person? Also door-to-door salespeople don't call you ahead of time. Usually they just hit up all the houses in an area.", "No where did it indicate that this was the same salesman, in fact, it reads as if each incident was a different salesman. He also was trying to respect her privacy by offering to talk on the front porch instead? He's a SALESMAN, he's trained not to take the first no. This issue should have been resolved by ADT, this guy basically gets a call sheet/work order and is expected to reach that amount of people by the end of the day. \n\nYou are right however, that scammers etc. do like to pose as security companies to gain access. But this isn't the case. it costs nothing to be kind to someone.", "I have one \ud83d\ude05", "Just because it\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s OKAY. A lot of these types of salesmen behave in coercive and even threatening ways. It can be scary and intimidating and some people will buy stuff because they don\u2019t know how else to get the salesman to leave. I fully support threatening to call the cops when these guys refuse to get off your property despite very clearly being told to leave.", "If the OP is dealing with as many solicitors as she suggested it would seem unusual to me. I've owned my home for almost 30 years, in a normal, non-gated, non-HOA neighborhood. I doubt I've seen more than a dozen in all that time. And yes, at least 3/4 were home security sales calls, and yes, they were very pushy.", "Nah they knew my name somehow? \n\nI think they might scrape sale / ownership records to find new homeowners. \n\n> And 7:30 at night is not uncommon. I have people coming around my place offering new internet packages\n\nAre you fr? Damn, maybe I've just not realized how much safer it's been living in an apartment where nobody can actually get to my door without being invited", "Dang you got kids AND cops stealing your stuff?", "I have a gun.\n\nMy TV is pretty sweet though, come get it!", "It's not about being capable, it's about being more likely to be a victim of assault? \n\nLike their whole pitch was about protecting myself as a solo woman? Soooo you'd think they'd understand", "I know right, and it\u2019s not like then will have success before 5-6pm when no one is home to sell to", "> he's trained not to take the first no.\n\nMaybe the company needs to train their salesmen better.\n\nBecause trying to play the \"you're a young lady living alone, we can protect you\" card... And totally failing to grasp \"no means no\" isn't helping their case. \n\nLike know your audience, the girlies aren't putting up with \"no means convince me\" anymore", "I think a lot of them are scraping home sale records to find recently sold houses? My neighbors aren't getting half of what I am, it seems related to me being new\n\nPlus election canvassing which I'm actually not bothered by, it's important to get people out to vote and they were all very respectful", "I know there was a pretty aggressive uptick in door to door internet sales when the line was improved. It sounds like OP ended up unintentionally on some list of wanting a repeat visit. \n\nShe needs to call ADT and tell them that they need to stop showing up at her door as most door to door people won't do anything to prevent that.", "That's 100% where it comes from. There's a ton of companies that watch for sales of homes being recorded and will send junk mail, sales people and call the number associated with the sale. Every time I've bought and sold a house it's the part of the move I look forward to the least as it will usually last a few months.\n\nAnd ADT is the absolute worst about it.", "Is it because the home is subscribed to the service? Because you *can* cancel that.\n\nAnd at least for my area, 7:30 is not uncommon. Usually people stop coming by around 8. And if I were you, I would start mentally prepping for people coming around for holiday donations like Save the Children, War Amps, etc.\n\nI understand how disarming this probably feels. Majority of people don't have bad intentions. Maybe just get a ring doorbell so you can monitor who is coming to your door.", "It's incredibly easy to get into an apartment building and into people homes for people with nefarious intent.", "Lmao everyone else does too", "Burglars have guns, too, & sometimes there is more than one burglar.", "I don\u2019t disagree with that, again, that\u2019s ADT\u2019s fault. Not this guys.", "Yep.  I got a ton of door knockers in the first 12-18 months after I bought my house trying to sell me everything you can think of.  I'd watch them after I told them no and they would walk out of the cul de sac without going to any other houses on the road.\n\nThe only ones who come now are the ones who are clearly just canvassing the entire neighborhood.  \n\nWhile they are annoying, I don't think 7:30 is that late.", "I'm not, I think the couple I bought the house from used to be? \n\nIt's so weird because I grew up in a city where if someone showed up at night and you don't know them? You better not open that door..\n\nSo it's so weird to have people just show up?", "Less so in the apartment, it had exterior and interior door locks, and peepholes on the door. Once and a while someone would come to my door but I just left it shut if I didn't know them", "All jokes aside, I don't give a damn about burgalies. I can afford new shit. And honestly if someone wants to take shit, I don't care, I don't need to \"unalive\" someone over a few hundred bucks \n\nThe kinda shit I bought the gun for is... Not threats to property lemme just say.", "Yeah true. He was kinda ignorant tho, to keep pushing after I said no. \n\nEven if he's at work, shouldn't common sense tell a guy that maybe harassing a young woman in her home at night and not leaving after being rejected multiple times is kiiiinda a shady thing to do? \n\nLike have some common sense man.", "Gotcha. So they're probably trying to maintain the house in their roster. Call the security company and tell them that you're being harassed by their sales people and that you want to ensure that you are taken off of their sales lists. \n\nIts important to note that sometimes door to door sales people are contracted out by a third party.\n\nYeah and that's totally fair. I grew up outside of Toronto and now live in the city and its still relatively common. \n\nIt definitely feels weird to have randoms rock up to your house."]}
