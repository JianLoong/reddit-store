I won't put you guys to sleep though. the simple answer is I do love my wife, we share a son together and I could not imagine a life without her. my only wish is she wasn't so insecure but she is also human.\n\nwith that said, lets get started. My wife is 39 and struggles a lot of with insecurity. to remedy this she has surrounded herself with friends who truthfully she thinks lesser of. A lot of her friends have been out of shape, poor, mentally unstable and such and my wife has admitted she feels like the stable and sensible one with all of them. when she's not talking about them like they're charity cases, she's usually insulting them. (before it's asked, my wife is in therapy and says she likes the therapist but doesn't think she's truly the issue)\n\nNow her youngest friend (31) Candy was one of the many friends my wife used for her own security. Candy was sort of a mess as a teenager, barely passed high school, couldn't hold down a job and was in and out of hospitals due to unmedicated mental health problems. I think my wife was probably the cruelest to her out of all her friends because Candy never really stood up for herself. at some point we didn't really understand how or what came over her, but Candy really did a 180, got medicated, got her degree and now is living in a nice country house, with a well paying job, her husband and 3 kids.\n\nwatching Candy change over the years has messed with my wife a lot. she's been crueler to her and constantly insults her house, her job, even how she raises her kids and loves to mention all the mistakes Candy made when she was young. Candy never said anything until yesterday. we were at her house around a fire and my wife asked how Candy could even be a fit mom after all her mental health problems and Candy, who was tippy, looks at my wife and says (Paraphrasing of course): You know, when I was young, I took your words to heart, until I learned you were just as messed up as me. And I realized to fully get back at all the ways you hurt me, there wasn't a point in telling you or asking for an apology, it was simply by being better than you. And now I am.\n\nnow I laughed, not so much out of humor but more shock. I got a death glare followed by my wife abruptly walking to the car and a threatening text she'd leave me behind if I didn't follow. we drove home in silence. when we got back my wife was crying in the bedroom. when I tried to comfort her she chucked all my stuff in my direction and screamed to leave.

He was smarter, funnier, more creative, and more talented in every way than she was. There was no way she could feel superior around him; his brilliance made her recede into the background. He never bent to her will and died when he was 51. She and my grandmother sapped his will to live like something out of a fairy tale. My mother was cheating on him with my stepdad the last few years of his life. Then she spent the rest of her life with my stepdad; they were together much longer than she had been with my father. My stepdad was a good guy when they started, not too bright, but kind and a good friend. The \"not too bright\" was key. He just took all her pretenses at face value and she made him adopt all her notions about everything, however bizarre, her weird ideas of right and wrong, her weird ideas of reality, her weird ideas of what was and wasn't ethical and decent. Because every time he piped up with a different opinion, she got enraged and pulverized him verbally and emotionally, stomping him into dirt. \n\nI was familiar with that, because that's how she'd treated me since I was three. There was no slack for being a child. Any hint of dissent, having a different taste or take from hers was swiftly punished by cruel mocking, jeering, screaming, or ad hominem attacks aimed to completely annihilate any sense of my own identity. If I wasn't fully mirroring her as she wanted to see herself, I was betraying her and needed to be wiped out. That also applied when I was mirroring her accurately -- not the sides of her she liked about herself but the ways she actually was. She had zero self-awareness. She started setting me up against my father when I was about 13. As we know now, trash-talking exes to the children is a big no-no. They were not divorced, we all lived together, and if I was friendly to him, she'd crush me for disloyalty. If I was nasty to him to please her, not only he'd crush me but he'd also pressure her to do something about me, and she'd crush me for making trouble for her.

Both ironically and tragically, she got Alzheimer's, and eventually he was forced to remortgage the house and place her in memory care early in the pandemic lockdown, where he couldn't see her for almost a year, until he got his shots, which he would have never got otherwise, and where she ultimately died of an extensive heart attack. I was not informed about any of it until it was all over. He really did love her, but he had to give her up, during the pandemic, and now, at 85, he doesn't even own their house anymore because all the money went to the memory care.

I hate to turn this around on you OP, and I know you said you're gonna look into help for you and your son but you love you wife and you like her yet her core personality is being a bully?  Not just being insecure, but being an abuser. In this post we've heard examples of emotional abuse (being cruel to others), manipulation (selectively choosing friends she deems lower?!) physical abuse (throwing things at you). Since you clearly do care about her I'm sure this is just the tip of what you're willing to tell the public about since you didn't come here for a hate train against your wife, if you did that would be a sign you didn't like her. \n\nI think you're so desensitized to your wife and the situation that it's water off your back bc you're concerned more about chuckling at a joke at her expense rather than her behaviour itself which is the root of all this unhappiness. Imagine how much happier and healthier your wife would be if these problems didn't exist, and poof your AITA post disappears bc that situation wouldn't be applicable. Laughing at a joke made at your wife's expense is always not that great, but your context, this entire post, her history and past behaviors is what made the exception of \"it might be a little warranted\".\n\nAlso at the same time if you love her and like her and this is her core personality, I wonder if you endorse and like bullies, if you like bullying like behavior and if that sort of thing is your bag.", "\n\n>Your wife seems to gather people around her that she can manipulate, gaslight and be downright cruel to in order to make herself feel better.

They get in with insecure, highly judgmental women that like to bully other women they see as competition. These women also typically talk shit about plenty of guys to that they don\u2019t find personally attractive or desirable, so because the woman is fawning over him instead of being a jerk to him, he feels special. She\u2019s not being mean, she\u2019s just being honest, that person really is a mess. She\u2019s just honest, that person could use to lose some weight. A lot of times these guys will also have the Carlos Mancia idea of humor, where if you can\u2019t think of something funny to say, you say something offensive, so offensive things about other people are hilarious. And because this person\u2019s bullying is not on them, the straight talk and offensive comments get brushed off as a personality quirk rather than a character flaw. \n\nWhen friends and family come to them with issues with their girlfriend, they blame the person being bullied for starting shit because \u201cyou know how she is\u201d or, like OP, assuming they have ulterior motives. And most importantly, they will claim that they hate drama, and get annoyed when people are trying to start things with them or their girlfriend by raising legitimate issues. But the truth is they love drama. They love gossip. They love other people\u2019s messes and talking about other people\u2019s messes. And what an absolutely delicious call out, happens right in front of them, even though that call out was of somebody that they claim they love, can\u2019t imagine life without, and acknowledge that that person is deeply insecure, and would be very hurt by what was said, regardless of how true it might be, they laugh.
