{"id": 25896, "submission_id": "165xcbd", "title": "AITA for laughing when my wife's friend called her out and said she was better than her?", "selftext": "I married my wife 9 years ago. as a long time browser on this sub I know a lot of you may ask if I actually like my wife or why I married her. there's a lot of reasons. I won't put you guys to sleep though. the simple answer is I do love my wife, we share a son together and I could not imagine a life without her. my only wish is she wasn't so insecure but she is also human.\n\nwith that said, lets get started. My wife is 39 and struggles a lot of with insecurity. to remedy this she has surrounded herself with friends who truthfully she thinks lesser of. A lot of her friends have been out of shape, poor, mentally unstable and such and my wife has admitted she feels like the stable and sensible one with all of them. when she's not talking about them like they're charity cases, she's usually insulting them. (before it's asked, my wife is in therapy and says she likes the therapist but doesn't think she's truly the issue)\n\nNow her youngest friend (31) Candy was one of the many friends my wife used for her own security. Candy was sort of a mess as a teenager, barely passed high school, couldn't hold down a job and was in and out of hospitals due to unmedicated mental health problems. I think my wife was probably the cruelest to her out of all her friends because Candy never really stood up for herself. at some point we didn't really understand how or what came over her, but Candy really did a 180, got medicated, got her degree and now is living in a nice country house, with a well paying job, her husband and 3 kids.\n\nwatching Candy change over the years has messed with my wife a lot. she's been crueler to her and constantly insults her house, her job, even how she raises her kids and loves to mention all the mistakes Candy made when she was young. Candy never said anything until yesterday. we were at her house around a fire and my wife asked how Candy could even be a fit mom after all her mental health problems and Candy, who was tippy, looks at my wife and says (Paraphrasing of course): You know, when I was young, I took your words to heart, until I learned you were just as messed up as me. And I realized to fully get back at all the ways you hurt me, there wasn't a point in telling you or asking for an apology, it was simply by being better than you. And now I am.\n\nnow I laughed, not so much out of humor but more shock. I got a death glare followed by my wife abruptly walking to the car and a threatening text she'd leave me behind if I didn't follow. we drove home in silence. when we got back my wife was crying in the bedroom. when I tried to comfort her she chucked all my stuff in my direction and screamed to leave. I now write this at my parents who don't think I'm wrong but at the same time they don't like my wife.

I assume it was a single guffaw, not a laughing hysterically and pointing sort of thing. Honestly your wife sounds like a cruel person and she should be held accountable for that. A startled chuckle is pretty mild.", "Imma join your parents here. You are NTA, but your wife is extremely messed up, and you might give some thought to taking your son and leaving before she messes him up. You are so close to her that you may not even have a good view of how being with a person like her changes your brain and your sense of reality and right and wrong. See a therapist for yourself. My mother was like her, and I\u2019m looking at my stepfather after their 30+ years together \u2014 he\u2019s a husk of the man he used to be, he had to essentially toss out his own mind and replace it with hers, because it was the only way to avoid her cruelty and abuse and survive next to her.", "Y T A for letting your wife behave like a shit person for so long. You're NTA for laughing though", "NTA.   \n\n\nLove doesn\u2019t negate facts. Your wife is an insufferable bully who uses others to make herself feel competent and superior! I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t even mean to laugh. But I\u2019d laugh too. Wifey had that reality check coming, and Candy has a point. The best revenge is living well!\n\nI\u2019m not saying couples therapy or divorce are the answer. That\u2019s for you to sort. But you\u2019re NTA in this situation, and I cannot imagine sharing my bed or my life with that type of person, let alone a child. Good luck, man.", "NTA. TBH your wife deserved to hear that and deserves to be miserable. The fact that she selectively picked her friends for their flaws and had the audacity to rip on Candy all those years. karma is getting her finally.", "NTA and touch\u00e9 Candy. Bet you waited a long time to deliver that zinger. Hard to say if wife is actually insecure or just a nasty person.", "NTA - Your wife seems really narcissistic, it\u2019s a word that gets thrown around a lot but it really seems like it the way she deems herself more worthy than others. Especially the way she got upset when someone told her \u201cthe truth\u201d so to speak.\n\nIf you tell her that you laughed out of shock and not at her she will probably not believe you because narcissist \u201cwants people to hurt them\u201d so others around them can feel sorry for them and give them attention and make them seem more worthy than the accuser and the other person In said situation.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention that she seems narcissistic too because she can\u2019t see that she is in the wrong for putting others down.", "NTA for laughing but why haven\u2019t you ever talked to your wife about how she treats Candy? And Candy is a bad ass! Good for her for finally standing up to your wife.", "NTA she needed to here that and more. She needs to focus on feeling happy with who she is and not on putting others down. You do not help her by allowing this. Every time she insults/criticizes one of her friends shut the conversation down. Tell her you love her but will no longer be a party to this. Not only for hers and your mental health but that of your son. Constantly hearing his mother criticize others is not a healthy environment for him", "NTA, being insecure doesn\u2019t make being mean ok. Sounds like maybe other than this one laugh you\u2019ve been allowing her behavior to pass because of her low self-esteem issues. I\u2019d suggest joining in on some therapy sessions for professional advice for how to support, but not enable your wife.", ">I married my wife 9 years ago. as a long time browser on this sub I know a lot of you may ask if I actually like my wife or why I married her. there's a lot of reasons.

Good for her! Honestly, you wife is the one people talk about and they say we don\u2019t want to invite her but someone will say we have to.\n\nThe laugh just came at the wrong time. You know what kind of person your wife is. She will get over it in time.\n\nBased on your comments. It sounds like you stayed with her during the dating out of spite. Like your family was wrong instead of thinking they were seeing things you did not. Now your invested and have a son so you talk but gloss over the bad behavior. Think when your son gets older she will be the parent that claims your son is the greatest at everything. Then people will not only talk about her but your son and have pity on you for living with it.", "Nta for laughing but definitely YTA for being ok with her behavior to this point", "you're not the first person to say that honestly. a lot of people have said she's toxic and unhealthy and I guess it being from my family I just assumed they didn't like her. they've told me I could do better and I took it as them wanting me to see someone else.

Best of luck to you and your son.", "If you do insist on staying with her, make sure you never have anymore kids with her. \n\nYour son is probably mostly safe, but if you ever have a daughter your wife will absolutely do everything in her power to wreck that little girl.", "Hopefully for Candy\u2019s sake your wife will leave her alone.
