Maybe not the good side, but still. Can you try to argue with this? Like, yes your dad and stepmother are your family. They are the parents of the bride.

It's only a necklace; it's not like you're getting a giant tattoo of Sarah on your arse and labeling it 'better than Beth'.  You have to decide what's best for YOU and live your life accordingly.

This is your day and I wareing that neckless makes you happy then you should ware it.", "NTA- your father has tried to remove your bio mother from your life. He was wrong to do so.\n\nI had a lot of postpartum depression after pregnancy.  I can't imagine that on top of mental health issues.  My partner was super supportive.  I can't imagine going through that without having a supportive partner.  I literally felt like the worst parent in the world.  Had my co-parent agreed with me. I don't know what it would have done to me.\n\nThat necklace must mean so much to you.  Your bio mother coming back and trying to warn you about the potential health issues is so meaningful as well.  Nobody wants to have that conversation.  That is truly putting her child first.  Something your dad isn't really doing.", "Beth and you are sensible and your father and siblings are extreme in their perspective. This is you mother. Wear the necklace. NTA.", "NTA, you can wear what you want. But be careful, I wouldn't be surprised if someone took it and made it disappear given the chance. Make sure you always know where it is", "NTA\n\nI can see both sides, your family wants to protect you from your bio mom who was not good for you ever.  Your bio mom is trying to be better and wants to know you.  No one is wrong here, real life is complicated, I wish you all the best.", "NTA. I can understand if your dad has some trauma from what he went through with trying to keep you safe while biomom was going through her crisis and ways it probably hurt him to lose her in the beginning. But those are his issues he needs to work through. Also I\u2019m a stepmom and my role in my child\u2019s life is definitely that of another mom to him. We have majority custody so I\u2019m some ways I parent him more than his biomom. So I definitely understand the complex emotions that comes with when you feel like you\u2019re your child\u2019s parent but you can still never really have that connection they inherently have with their bio parent. So maybe Beth is feeling some things, but again those are her feelings to work through. As parents it\u2019s our job to do what\u2019s best for our kids and not put our issues onto them. Your parents and siblings are allowed to have their feelings, but ultimately this necklace is a personal thing between you and your bio mom and is not really anyone else\u2019s business to comment on.", "NTA op. It\u2019s an accessory to your wedding outfit, that only you get to choose. No one gets to tell a bride what they can/can\u2019t wear on their wedding day. No one else has a say whatsoever. I\u2019d recommend letting them know that if they are that uncomfortable with you wearing a fricken NECKLACE at your WEDDING, they can choose to not attend. Easy peasy.", "Nta, the necklace doesn\u2019t take away anything from your family. It\u2019s a control issue that they need to get over", "NTA", "Wow. May I say how impressed I am by you? Your clarity of perspective; your straigt-forwardness; your understanding that all of us humans have our personal challenges; and your capacity to give room to others for their challenges but also maintain your own boundaries and take care of your own needs. Despite the family challenges, your own mental health challenges, and at a somewhat young age. I'm just feeling so happy for the person that you are!\n\nOf course, NTA.\n\nI think the only thing I suggest is to feel out your stepmom. She may have more understanding of your position than your dad or siblings do. (Maybe because the just focus on loving and appreciating her as your mom and not forgiving your bio mom for the risks of her past behavior toward you. But maybe your stepmom knows you love, respect, and appreciate her and isn't as threatened by you also loving and appreciating your biomom.)\n\nOther than that suggestion, it seems you have it all in hand. Their feelings about that necklace (such a sweet gift from your biomom!) are theirs to manage, not yours. They can be disappointed in you; it's probably no more than your disappointment in them for not understanding or at least respecting that this is your decision and is not any form of a statement against your stepmom.\n\nGood wishes to you on your marriage and future.", "NTA. If stepmom doesn't understand, that is unfortunate, but not your problem. Trying to build a relationship with a bio parent who was missing is difficult but important. You are doing things for your well being, as an adult.", "Beth has been in your life for most of it, and she is getting the recognition she deserves. Sarah has been unable through no fault of her own, so she is getting the recognition she deserves. I don't think your family has any right to object. NTA.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur dad and stepmom, are AHs.", "NTA... You have 2 strong women in your life. One that struggles with mental illnesses and one that struggles with feeling like she should be enough for you. Your family does need to accept your connection to your birth mom. Hopefully being kind and firm and consistent will win you the respect you deserve. Best wishes.", "NTA\n\nwithout further contect: You connected with your birth mother, both because she tried to get her life in order for you and because she seems to suffer from the same mental health issues. You got a **very** important necklace from her, for your wedding, which shows that she does in fact treasure you alot. \n\nNothing wrong with wanting to wear said necklace. \n\nTo me it seems like your family has this kind of fairytale narrative in their heads, where the good stepmother triumphs over the evil bio mom (read: a woman who had a few rough patches in her life due to mental health issues) in your heart. So they take it as an offense when you don't play along. Even something as small as a necklace is huge enough of an insult, because in their eyes you put the \"Woman unfit to be your mother\" at the same level as the \"true mother\". \n\nBut maybe I'm missing context her about your bio mom that would make you families reaction more morally gray? \n\nEither way it's one necklace and you're an adult.", "It sounds like there is more back story behind this. Your dad seems to be hurt by Bio Mom a lot. Talk to him alone and see why he hated her that much.\n\nBloodline doesn't define relationship, both Beth and Sarah can be your mom. They can be equally important to you. And its not fair to decide who is \"more important\". Your siblings will not be able to understand that. Beth is the only person you need to ensure that she will be your mom.", "Thank you. This has always been such a sensitive subject within my family. Sometimes I do feel like it's a topic I can't bring up things because it will not go well. This is something I do not want to have an argument over.", "I could not argue that with my dad. Beth hasn't actually said anything and I wonder if that's because she's holding back because she knows this should be my decision. But I'm not sure my dad will ever be okay with this. No matter how I argue it.", "It's kept in a very safe place. I would especially worry about my siblings trying to break it or something before my wedding. They can be sneaky.", "Thank you. It's such a difficult topic but dad has always felt like I should go along with him on this and I don't always agree.", "I have spoken to Beth. Even with me opening up to her she wasn't thrilled about me having contact with my bio mom.", "I have sat him down and honestly, his answers upset me a lot. I understand he went through a lot. But he holds her responsible for every single thing and believes she just didn't care enough about us to be healthier.", "This is what bothers me. OP's father acts like Sarah chose to be so mentally ill that she lost everything but her parental rights. As you said, Sarah respected the father's wishes, so it doesn't sound like she was ever a threat. But he chose to ignore the fact mental illness runs on Sarah's side of the family, like that would be enough to spare OP. Instead, it caused a delay in diagnosis and treatment.", "It does. Not only because it's the only thing Sarah has that is in any way sentimental. But it's the only thing her parents ever gave her. I see it as a symbol of love that exists even with the worst that mental illness has to offer and a sign that that love can last through the different generations, even when the the people who first bought it to give to their daughter died when she was still so young (17). Given she put herself out there knowing she was hated by my dad to try and protect me, it showed me she still had that love for me even if she couldn't be there while I was growing up.", "They're just trying to be controlling, but as long as you are happy with your relationship with bio mom, then you are doing nothing wrong. They are only worried about themselves, but you should keep putting yourself and your best interest first always!", "... and you shouldn't always agree because no one is always right.  \n\n\nIf he had listened to your bio mom earlier, how much trouble would he have saved you because he had planned ahead for the possibility of you inheriting the illnesses your bio mom warned him were an issue?  Instead, he was so sure he was right that he delayed your treatment by years out of stone stubbornness.    \n\n\nThis is a repeat of that on a (much smaller scale), with his need to be right being more important to him than what makes you happy.  Not cool.", "Then I guess it is something that she is going to have to deal with. Sarah can't help having mental health problems and she tried to keep in contact. You are quite capable of having a relationship and loving both Beth and Sarah.\n\n They do not have to compete or feel jealous about one another and anyone who is trying convince you to have less love and support in your life should check themselves.", "He also ignored that both of Sarah's parents died when she was 17 and both suffered the same way Sarah did. Sarah had no childhood really and then for the majority of her adult life she has suffered over and over again. He witnessed enough of it. Then he saw me struggling and preferred to keep up pretenses than get me the help I truly needed. Sarah said her biggest hope was I could be the one saved. And because my dad was so stubborn it put me at risk to not.", "And then he wasn't even the one to share the medical history - that was stepmom.  Dad took OP away from mom (given we don't know how unstable and/or dangerous she could have been, I fully acknowledge it could have been for good reasons), and then refused to acknowledge medical history that did have am impact on OP.\n\nDad seems like he tried really hard to erase everything of bio mom from OP's life, and is furious that is didn't work.  For that, he's a royal asshole."]}
