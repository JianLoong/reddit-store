If he does, then you really need to think twice about marrying him.  He needs to cut the apron strings and back you as his wife (future).  You basically need to know that he has your back and will stand up for you.  And even to the point where he will limit contact with his parents if they manipulate and gaslight.\n\nWhat do you think is going to happen when you have kids?  Is grandma deciding how you bring your child/ren up?  \n\nDoes Alex have any siblings with kids?  What is their relationship with his parents?  Have you spent time with them to get an idea of how controlling everyone is, or do the kids parents decide how they want to parent their kids.\n\nHas Alex been married before, or had a long term relationship?  Does he have any kids?  He's not old but he's not young either.  Does he want any kids?  Do you?  \n\nThe ultimatum you gave your MIL is neither here not there.

If MIL wants to plan your wedding as though it was yours, perhaps having an earlier small wedding in a location that's important to you, is something worth considering.  Even eloping.

Not saying you need to cut him loose, but\u2026 think about whose side he\u2019s on.", "So he wants you to pay for the wedding,  but let her keep telling everyone she is paying for the wedding?", "Why does Alex want this?  \n\nDoes she keep  lying about her paying for it?  \n\nA compromise would be to tell people that you and Alex decided you wanted something simpler, and that you would like to pay for it.  \n\nUltimately these people are going to be in your life for a good long time.  You might want to get on better terms with them.  You future MIL sounds like a piece of work, but Alex has not shut her down properly either.  My MIL did something that offended me, and my husband wrote her a letter telling her that it wasn't acceptable.  To be fair,  my MIL was much easier to deal with than your MIL sounds like.  \n\nDo you and Alex buy your in-laws meals or host them?  Do you bring host gifts when you visit them?  \n\nSeriously, do you want this wedding?  I think you want the marriage, but maybe you want a party where you live, to celebrate instead?  This sounds like you might have a combination of MAGA people and liberals at the same party, and I wonder how conducive that will be for you to enjoy yourselves? Maybe two parties?  One for you and your friends to celebrate the marriage, and a smaller wedding?", "Do you really want her to pay for the wedding venue and have her casting it up all the time, even if you have the money, she will. A sly dig and there etc. Honestly use would be better to move venues and pay for it yourselves and say use did. Save the hassle and tell the OH to stand ground because if you don't your setting your self up for a life of misery. Just need to ask has he is a bit older than you has he been married before? How did that go? Did he stand up to his mum for his previous wife? Just at 48 if its first time marriage no wonder with parents like that just make sure he stands firm with you, supports and has your back at all times and you  you sound like you've got a strong constitution so keep it \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude09 you'll need it with a MIL like that. Good luck  def NAH", "Fairly sure he won\u2019t decide to go against his mom, but she lives in her fiefdom down South and they live up North. Hopefully \u201cMother\u201d keeps that migraine for the rest of her natural life when her DIL is around.", "NTA \u2026. But I\u2019d find a whole new dude. He\u2019s 16 years older than you (yikes) almost 50 and he still can\u2019t tell his mother when to stay in her lane? Red flags all over this relationship", "lol why do so many women come on here & say their STB/husband is a \"great catch\" and then they proceed to tell us abt how he is NOT a \"great catch\" \nyour stb husband is just sitting back, watching his mother disrespect you? is he not sticking up for you? this is a husband problem. \nNTA", "NT A bit you need to get away from those people.", "NTA - you took control of the situation.  This woman would make your life difficult until she met her eteranal reward.\n\nshe wishes her baby boy married a woman who lived locally , somebody she might control but he is marrying UP and that is bothering her.  Its not a dynamic she is comfortable with", "Oh bless her heart, isn\u2019t she just a peach. \n\nNTA", "NTA. F her.", "NTA for regaling us with a modern day Sophie\u2019s Choice. Am waiting for the update!", "NTA and don't back down from this. That woman sounds insufferable.", "NTA, but come on, your MIL and FIL are showing massive red flags for the kind of people they are and your future husband is showing massive red flags by enabling it. \n\nHe should be defending you, telling his parents to stop and shouldn't be divulging personal information like the hold up with the pre-nup stuff to his parents when he would have to know it'd affect you. \n\nThis really doesn't seem like a fun life you're going to have OP, constantly belittled, made fun of, and shown basically zero respect by all three of them.", "NTA. You are a hero.", "NTA. She just got a taste of the fact her DIL-to-be is not a pushover or willing to be bullied. She also realized that you are also her equal and not below her so she doesn\u2019t know how to cope with that. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d want to marry into that kind of situation or not. Most of the time I would likely advise against it, but I think you could hold your own.  It think the issue here is that your fianc\u00e9 needs to understand the dynamics here and how completely offensive his mother has been to this point and why getting a dose of her own medicine was appropriate and not too harsh. She needs to know that her behavior is not okay and you are very capable of calling her on her BS. Or, would he prefer a spouse that is willing to be a doormat to his mother? Because if it\u2019s the latter, you may need to re-evaluate things.", "NTA and if your fiance isn't supportive of you in your obvious checkmate to that old birds game - but seems fine letting his mother run rough-shot over your wedding and badmouth you - I would reconsider marrying him or at least prolonging the engagement.", "NTA.   \n\n\nAnd well played! Kudos!", "Hmm I would think in the long game here. Neither option works out for your MIL and eventually for you (I mean in the long run). OP clearly doesn't care about face because they wear supposedly drab clothing for this area and put up with so much garbage from other people assuming they're poor. If face and status aren't important to OP, then I think this situation can be leveraged a better way. Changing the venue and telling everyone else the real reason will damage future MIL's reputation, sure. But it won't r all impact OP's life, except for the worse in terms of the long-term relationship. \n\nThe thing is that the future MIL has already lost what she values the most - power over the OP. She knows she doesn't have that anymore. I think if OP concedes to the husband's suggestion of changing venue and keeping quiet, the following things will happen in the long-term: \n\n1. The town will absolutely know something is up because of the change and will be dying with curiosity about the reason. \n\n2. Future MIL will NEVER be able to tell the truth AND not be able to bad-mouth OP because if she does, the truth will come tumbling out from OP if they choose to do so. She cannot continue being so snide and disrespectful. \n\n3. Townfolk will eventually connect the dots. \n\nEither way OP has already won. The next step now is playing the long game - how to hold that power. By telling the truth about the venue change, OP will likely lose that power and create resentment that could come up in other ways. If they have kids for instance, future MIL will still be the grandmother. Etc. \n\nI think ceding to venue change is honestly already a huge slap in the face, and future MIL will have to change her behaviour from then on. And then OP can always say, \u201cremember when you thought I was a good digger? Ah, those were the days weren't they? So funny.\" Or even, \"here, let me buy you a coffee - my shout.\u201d", "NTA she thought she had a stick to beat you with then found out you have a bigger stick.", "Why is she marrying him?", "\"Bless her geart\"    the perfect ending!", "Do not enter into a marriage where you're expected to lie and pander to anyone. No matter how much you love someone, the demands will erode your confidence and your sense of self.\n\nIf someone doesn't love you *as you are*, and give you the space and encouragement to be your best self, then surviving the natural ups and downs of life will be a whole lot harder than it should be, either with a good partner, or on your own.", "You will be an AH if you let her walk all over you. \nTell Alex to man up and make a decent decision, he can\u2019t hide away from it every time", "I think future MIL and Alex deserve each other.", "Your fianc\u00e9 is not going to make a good husband. Your husband is u see the influence of his mother very strongly.  I highly recommend your husband, and you get counselling as to expectations, his behaviour reference his mother, managing his mother, and attempting to get your fianc\u00e9 to remove himself from having his head up her arse.", "Get couples counselling before the marriage, you guys need to be on the same page here.\n\nWhat's going to happen if you have kids, and you need to hold her at arms length because of her boundary crossing (getting the kids baptised /giving them food they shouldn't be eating/slagging you off etc), but Alex thinks you're \"being too harsh\".\n\nAlex needs to speak up himself and be consistent, and acknowledge his mum has been at best a bully, and he wants her to continue with impunity. That's a deal breaker, unless you're prepared to fight alone against your mil your whole marriage.", "Why didn't Alex put her in her place before it got this bad? I think they also wanted a prenup because Alex is so much older.", "OP she is using her downtime (ie the migraine) to think of a way outta this. I am going with, \u201cI am shocked that my DIL has been using me for money when it turns out that she had her own this whole time.\u201d", "do not under any circumstances change the venue hahaha this is too good of a revenge that SHE WALKED INTO HERSELF WITH NO EFFORT FROM YOU. Also please ensure you post an update to confirm you got married at the venue and his mother had to live with it hahahah", "Is it really worth it, she put mil in her place,  whats to gain", "Trust me, for having a peaceful, stress-free wedding, the loss of any deposits is a small price to pay.", "Damn right, although fiance needs to get on board with the terms and be the one to enforce them on his out of line mother, not beg leniency on her behalf.", "MIL dealt the cards, opened the bidding, upped the ante, but OP's the one with the winning hand. OP doesn't need to offer MIL a compromise, she has been nice enough to give MIL a choice of which side of her face to lose.\n\nYes, these people ARE going to be in OP's life for a long time, so it's best to define the boundaries now and hold fast. This MIL isn't ever going to voluntarily be reasonable. Contact can be limited if necessary, it won't even take much effort, OP and fiance live far away."]}
