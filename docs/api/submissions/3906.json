If he does, then you really need to think twice about marrying him.  He needs to cut the apron strings and back you as his wife (future).  You basically need to know that he has your back and will stand up for you.

Is grandma deciding how you bring your child/ren up?  \n\nDoes Alex have any siblings with kids?  What is their relationship with his parents?

Most of the time I would likely advise against it, but I think you could hold your own.  It think the issue here is that your fianc\u00e9 needs to understand the dynamics here and how completely offensive his mother has been to this point and why getting a dose of her own medicine was appropriate and not too harsh. She needs to know that her behavior is not okay and you are very capable of calling her on her BS. Or, would he prefer a spouse that is willing to be a doormat to his mother?

Kudos!", "Hmm I would think in the long game here. Neither option works out for your MIL and eventually for you (I mean in the long run). OP clearly doesn't care about face because they wear supposedly drab clothing for this area and put up with so much garbage from other people assuming they're poor. If face and status aren't important to OP, then I think this situation can be leveraged a better way. Changing the venue and telling everyone else the real reason will damage future MIL's reputation, sure. But it won't r all impact OP's life, except for the worse in terms of the long-term relationship. \n\nThe thing is that the future MIL has already lost what she values the most - power over the OP. She knows she doesn't have that anymore. I think if OP concedes to the husband's suggestion of changing venue and keeping quiet, the following things will happen in the long-term: \n\n1. The town will absolutely know something is up because of the change and will be dying with curiosity about the reason. \n\n2. Future MIL will NEVER be able to tell the truth AND not be able to bad-mouth OP because if she does, the truth will come tumbling out from OP if they choose to do so. She cannot continue being so snide and disrespectful. \n\n3. Townfolk will eventually connect the dots. \n\nEither way OP has already won. The next step now is playing the long game - how to hold that power. By telling the truth about the venue change, OP will likely lose that power and create resentment that could come up in other ways. If they have kids for instance, future MIL will still be the grandmother. Etc. \n\nI think ceding to venue change is honestly already a huge slap in the face, and future MIL will have to change her behaviour from then on.

It\u2019s a very common pattern that you\u2019ll see with people raised by narcissists.", "NTA. Loved the plot twist. Congratulations, by the way!!! I think you should consider eloping for fun and adventure!", "Lmfaaaaaoooooo \ud83d\ude02 thats what she gets!!!\n\nYour ultimatum was spot on!!!", "NTA - but LOL! She got her comeuppance . . .", "NTA. This did my heart a happy.", "NTA. Future MIL doesn\u2019t like things held over her head either. You gave her an option.  Honestly considering MIL attitude I would rather pay for it mostly myself and then brag about it to her friends. Follow through on the pre nup. If may benefit you more than future hubby. Good luck w her as MIL. She sounds like a real winner.", "Your soon to be husband is a 48 year old man. Where is he in all of this?? Still kowtowing to mamas control issues? Good luck living the rest of her life with her! NTA", "She grabbed me before I had my coffee (\ud83d\udc79) and basically said \u201cVictoria, Alex is telling me that your lawyers are *still* editing the pre-nup, what could possibly be in there?\u201d And I told her that my real property and other assets were being meticulously listed out and I need to be sure to disclose everything to the lawyers/Alex, which she was genuinely confused by. \n\nI think what people aren\u2019t getting is that Alex has told her that I\u2019m not a gold digger and I don\u2019t need or want his money multiple times, but she refused to hear it, and no one\u2019s sat down and given her an accounting of my assets because it\u2019s none of her business. She also apparently thought Alex had bought me my new car, which he hadn\u2019t, or that he was supporting me, which he isn\u2019t (beyond lingerie and dinners out, I guess). She also apparently thought I had law school debt left. I guess maybe she thought when Alex and I said that I \u201chad money\u201d and was \u201cdoing well,\u201d I just meant that I was in debt or had very little but too proud or conniving to mention it.", "Please consider that I didn\u2019t. \ud83d\ude09", "I love how OP mentioned the pre-nup first, then revealed the twist that it's her assets the pre-nup will cover \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa", "I mean, you have to ask? She\u2019s 32 marrying a 48 year old and saying \u201cwe are not having children,\u201d so sounds like she probably actually likes him. By comparison he\u2019s poor, old, and has obnoxious family. Since there\u2019s no raising of kids involved, the only thing left is that she actually enjoys his company.", "Replies that you're getting like this are from people who frequent the justnomil sub - they pretend to be a support sub for people with nasty MILs but really they're just a drama sub who love to encourage the nuclear option/destroy your relationship for the sake of getting more dramatic stories.  That's why this particular user responded with 'let us know what happens' because they're hoping for more drama to get their kicks.", "Talk now, set and agree on boundaries and his support in dealing with his mother in enforcing them; otherwise, she will be at you for life.  If you can't stand together on this you may want to refrain from the marriage.", "That makes sense, the number of \u201cdump him immediately\u201d or \u201cyou have to stop speaking to her forever or you\u2019re an idiot and he\u2019s a momma\u2019s boy doormat\u201d replies were confusing me.", "I\u2019m not getting married on an old plantation.", "Yeah.  Ignore those folks, especially the ones recommending you go to a justno sub, they're a 'special' bunch.  They prey on people who don't understand that relationships of any sort require maturity and communication.  You've clearly got a good head on your shoulders and are handling stuff well.", ">Eureka!", "NTA", "NTA. If Alex this this was too harsh, how many years over 50 is he going to wait before cutting the apron strings?", "NTA , hilarious, hoist by her own petard", "Why are you even marrying into this hot mess of a family? \ud83e\udd2e", "NTA. However, I think you have some serious thinking to do, at the very least a serious talk with your fiance about future and expectations. \n\nYou gave her an ultimatum, which honestly is loose loose for her (in her mind). This is only because of how she acted, it's 100% karma on her. However, it hasn't helped the wedge that's between the two of you. Your husband's reaction isn't helping. He is stuck between you and his mom. Yes, he should be cutting the cord and standing up for himself and you, but even when it's right, it's not the easiest thing to do.\n\nYou need to make sure thr two of you are on the same page, because MIL is not going to forgive, nor forget any of this. I wouldn't be surprised if she tried to turn it around on you for keeping how much you're worth from her so that she knew she didn't have to look down her nose at you or some other bs. If you do not address this issue now with hubby, it is going to fester and the eventual fall out is going to be huge and not pretty.\n\nI applaud you on how you handled all of it, and for thr ultimatium because it's just beautiful. Regardless of what happens though, there is definitely bigger issues at play. Talk with your husband, maybe even getting some pre marriage counseling, and make sure that this is still the right choice for you both.", "Beautifully executed, OP; and, obviously, NTA", "NTA, and well. played!", "Ok. This needs to go into r/prorevenge.\nNTA", "play stupid games whin stupid prizes, mil. also is fiance not defending you at all in this? that's pretty conerning NTA", "Ha ha ha brilliant well played NTA. Hope Alex sees what his mom is really like.", "So he wants her to keep publicly humiliating you.", "I\u2019m not sure Alex is a winner.", "I agree with this here. If your husband cannot recognize these problems and face them with you, this signals a more worrying pattern. Address it now", "You\u2019re being the bigger person and that\u2019s commendable. It\u2019s easy for strangers on the internet to think they know better about your life and relationships than you. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd"]}
