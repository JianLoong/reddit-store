Why hasn't he torn her a new one for her behavior towards his beloved?", "NTA.\n\nBut you have to seriously consider marrying into a family like this.\n\nWhat you need to find out is where Alex stands with his parents and what his values are v's theirs.\n\nIs he a momma's boy that lets his mom make all the decisions for him and he defers all decisions to her (and his father)?  If he does, then you really need to think twice about marrying him.  He needs to cut the apron strings and back you as his wife (future).  You basically need to know that he has your back and will stand up for you.  And even to the point where he will limit contact with his parents if they manipulate and gaslight.\n\nWhat do you think is going to happen when you have kids?  Is grandma deciding how you bring your child/ren up?  \n\nDoes Alex have any siblings with kids?  What is their relationship with his parents?  Have you spent time with them to get an idea of how controlling everyone is, or do the kids parents decide how they want to parent their kids.\n\nHas Alex been married before, or had a long term relationship?  Does he have any kids?  He's not old but he's not young either.  Does he want any kids?  Do you?  \n\nThe ultimatum you gave your MIL is neither here not there.  It's a lot of money but may not be a lot if you are rich.\n\nIt's the marriage that's important.  If MIL wants to plan your wedding as though it was yours, perhaps having an earlier small wedding in a location that's important to you, is something worth considering.  Even eloping.  You don't want someone else taking over.  Even if you 'win' against your MIL when it comes to wedding decisions... can you be sure that she won't try and sabotage it?
