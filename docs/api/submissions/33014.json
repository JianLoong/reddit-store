If there are other days that they could volunteer on, perhaps suggest one of those. If the kitchen doesn't usually serve food except on the holidays, you are probably SOL.", "NTA. This would be an excellent tradition when the children are older. For the ages they're at now, Christmas is a magical time and it should be about them, at home with family. It's understandable that you would want to build your own traditions with them while they're young.\n\nIt's worth noting that your husband and his mom have been doing this for 20+ years, and he's 39 years old. So he didn't start doing it until he was well into his teens. Point out to him that he wasn't spending Christmas in soup kitchens when he was 2 and 4 years old.", "NAH. Just explain what you did here: the kids are too young and will be a distraction while trying to do the volunteering. You want him to skip it this year and have a Christmas at home with his children this year. \n\nMaybe he and his mother will agree to volunteer a different day and she can join you at your home for dinner?\n\nMy situation is different, but I have to juggle between my house, my sister's, my Dad's, and my in-laws'. We end up doing something different every year to keep everyone happy. Traditions are wonderful, but at the moment this one needs to be temporarily adjusted.", "NAH you can create your own tradition around your husband\u2019s schedule.\nYou don\u2019t have to join him and the children don\u2019t have to go unless they are old enough to help and want to participate.\nOpen gifts Christmas Eve or get up early and do gifts. Start a tradition of you and the kids going to a movie or playing board games or visiting other family until two. Y W B T A if you force him to quit", "NAH.  He can go if he wants, but the kids going should be by mutual agreement.", "NTA. How is he going to serve food AND watch the kids. Nope, too many things could go wrong and also exposing the kids to so many strangers where you know at least some are ill.", "NAH\n\nHe and his mom can and should go, it\u2019s their tradition and it\u2019s important to them and is very nice. When the kids are older it will be a great lesson for them to learn as well. \n\nBUT you\u2019re right. The kids are too young, your husband and MIL will be busy helping, and they\u2019re trying to take kids around A BUNCH of complete strangers and food prep. I can\u2019t imagine being that fucking stupid.", "NTA.  It's  time you had your own family traditions. Your kids are definitely too young to go. Who will be watching them while he and his mother do the serving and break down. I don't imagine it makes you feel good to be left out on Christmas day. You need to have a serious talk about how all this makes you feel. If he doesn't care, he shouldn't be a father and husband.", "NTA. You are his family now. The one he chose. It\u2019s time for new traditions. Maybe when the kids are older they can serve at a soup kitchen. They are at the age where they need fun traditions and to experience Christmas with family.", "There are so many things wrong with your husband's plan. First of all, So your kids are going to spend 3 hours in the car on the way to and from the soup kitchen, on Christmas day? And then at the soup kitchen they will be there for hours, doing what? Getting in the way? Being bored out of their minds? And, through all of this, they will be interacting with countless random adults who are service users of the soup kitchen who do not have safety clearances to be around your kids? \n\nIf your husband returns around 2 pm with the kids, this means that the majority of Christmas Day will be spent on \"his\" tradition. Most of the daytime will be gone by the time they get home, and you'll be left with the \"witching hour\" when your kids are exhausted and cranky for \"your\" traditions. This is completely unfair to you. \n\nIt's nice to help out the community with good works. But your children are also part of your husband's community and right now his primary obligation is to them. Children only get one childhood. It's ok for your efforts to be spent on their happiness.", "NAH to tell him that, no.", "INFO: What alternative are you suggesting instead?", "NAH he's not going to be able to do much of the work he usually does with a 2 and 4 year old around though. They aren't at the age that they can be left unsupervised so what is he planning on doing with them.", "I love his Christmas tradition but understand why you want to start your own family's traditions as well.\n\nOne thing he might want to consider: can he go and volunteer Christmas Eve or another day that week with his Mom (and with the kids when they're older)? Many people volunteer on Christmas but soup kitchens really need volunteers the rest of the year. Maybe he and his Mom can volunteer once a month and ask the soup kitchen they work with what they need.\n\nIf you host Christmas celebrations at your house and he doesn't arrive until 2 pm  guess who is going to have to do ALL the prep by themselves every single year?", "INFO:  How was this handled pre-pandemic? Did you ride along?", "NAH. I think it is time y\u2019all sit down and discuss what traditions you want for your family. Maybe Christmas Eve at your house and if you do Santa then early Christmas morning. Then off to the Soup Kitchen. Compromise is Key!", "NAH but I think it would be easy to integrate your new traditions with his old one. You don't have to open gifts on the 25th. You could always start a tradition where your kids open gifts on Christmas Eve and Christmas is reserved for the soup kitchen.", "NTA for telling him.  But that doesn't mean he won't go. What he is doing is a good thing.  Christmas is supposed to be about giving.", "I don\u2019t know what I would call this\u2026 I\u2019m wavering between E S H and N A H\n\nI would truly be surprised if a soup kitchen were willing to have kids that young participate in this activity. I\u2019ve looked for many family volunteer opportunities along food kitchens/pantries and most places require kids to be several years older than 2 and 4. \n\nI think it\u2019s unfair that you would be left alone without your family for most of the day on Christmas due to a medical condition that makes long road trips painful. \n\nAnd who wants to spend 90 minutes minimum one way in a car for the kids to be bored as soon as they get there? What if your kids are blunt in the way most young children are and they say something unintentionally hurtful to the people being served?\n\nOn the other hand, why can\u2019t you find some sort of tradition that works around the soup kitchen? Do some presents Christmas Eve (when I was young we were allowed to open one present the night before) or wake up earlier on Christmas morning for presents, have a morning of baking with the kids and playing with their toys, and then when your husband gets home you can do dinner?", "NTA\n\nThis will *ruin* Christmas for your children.", "I think they are too young to be introduced to this tradition and I would use that as your main argument. \n\nI do however think you shouldn't stop this tradition for him or his mother and in the future your children should be 100% included. \n\nYou two just need to communicate.", "Nah", "NTA. It sounds like his tradition is negatively affecting you pretty badly. You have medical issues and hes besically been abandoning you to look after two young kids alone (to volunteer sure but it isnt like its going to burn down if he isnt there) and also causing you to bounce from house to house. The argument ends at medical issues. You are not an accessory TO his family, you ARE his family. If you and the kids can't go he doesnt need to either until the kids are old enough to either go or not be so challenging at home. He kind of sounds like a mommas boy and like he needs a reminder that his priorities lie with his wife and children, not his mother. Maybe he can go another day if it's that important, but you have a right to an enjoyable and accessible Christmas.\n\nEDIT: I misread, he's not abandoning the kids he's taking them with him which is so much better. Young kids do great in kitchens where the adults watching them are distracted, I'm sure the heating elements, knives, and other things wont be an issue. Im also sure the kids wont wander off either and will be properly supervised the whole time.", "Eh\u2026. You\u2019re a mild a-hole. It isn\u2019t unreasonable to have your own Christmas traditions but to insist he get rid of his is pretty crappy. Volunteering is a great way to bond as a family and teach your children how to be good human beings. Volunteer with your family and find your own tradition that happens on Christmas Eve or on the Christmas Day afternoon.", "NAH,  that would be a long day for the kids.  Sounds like you and husband need to communicate better.  I also understand that you want to start new traditions with you husband and kids.", "Slight YTA for wanting him to stop what he is feels good doing on a day when so many go without. However, you can ask him to wait until your kids are older to go and help.", "Esh - I don't think this is about a tradition only.  It's about giving back and it is probably deeply meaningful to him. For him, Christmas can be shared, giving back and celebrating at home so a win-win.  If everyone thought like you and the people who say he can do another day - then there would be noone helping on Christmas.  Your husband is doing something good for people  and he isn't hurting you or kids by starting Chrsitmas later or by having kids join him.  I suggest rather than wanting your own traditions  - you so miss the point of what he is doing - you find a compromise with him.  Be prepared though because if it is in heart to volunteer and serve others he may not want to change.  I respect your husband!  What I would not respect is if he didn't celebrate with you/kids at all.  Until you've been in a position if need you can never understand the good that he is doing - you wouldn't want to change it if you knew.", "INFO: is it possible for your family (including his mother, if she wants) to start your own tradition in this spirit of this one?", "Reading your post, it sounds nice and yes you want to start new family traditions.  But reading your explanation why you might be the ah, yes, YTA.  You dont force anyone to give up their tradition, let alone a SO who has been doing something with his mother for 20 years.  Why does he have to stop?  Cant you blend traditions, start new ones around his?  It should be a discussion, especially with kids.  Have the kids open Santa gifts before they go.  Then family gifts when they come back.  Start making family dinner while they're gone and have a beautiful meal together Christmas night.  Endless possibilities.  So many people complain that Christmas has become too commercial and kids dont get the meaning, that its all about what they get.  Well here is a ready opportunity to teach them and you want to rip it away because....", "Slightly YTA because you should have discussed plans with him BEFORE telling your family anything. I'd be extremely upset if my wife made plans AND told someone about those before discussing them with me, as much as she would be upset with me if I were to do the same. Every year we need to compromise between Christmas with my family or with hers (not close), usually we alternate and spend every other year with each, but despite this having become a habit, we always discuss plans together before telling anything anyone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It makes sense to focus on building traditions your kids can actually participate in, instead of them being a nuisance or liability at a soup kitchen. Homeless people are not tools to teach your young children, who are too young to learn from this anyway. Homeless folks are real people who deserve respect and also EFFECTIVE ADULT WORKERS to prepare and serve them food safely and efficiently. Your husband is being selfish & obtuse, he can volunteer on the 24th or 26th or literally any other day of the year at a kitchen.

Perhaps he could spend some time in the morning with the children and then, when they are playing with their toys, go do this, and then come back in the afternoon/for dinner to spend more time with the family?  I remember being a kid, I did not spend all day with my parents, I was busy playing with my new Lego or game or whatever.  They\u2019ll be okay if dad steps out.

It\u2019s a huge safety hazard and a liability to have them there.", "Or a good way for small kids to get sick. It\u2019s flue, rsv and covid is still a thing. These are toddlers. They do not need to be exposed to that many people. They cannot wear a mask.", "They\u2019re 2 and 4. They likely won\u2019t remember it, won\u2019t be able to help, and will be in the way.", "Again, why does it have to be either or?  Christmas is about all family.  I know no one who spends the entire 24 hours with just their SO.  Parents still want to see their adult children, and their grand children.  Every Christmas my entire childhood was spent driving 8 hours to see my grandmother Christmas evening.  OP stated she wanted to force her SO to stop all his family traditions.  That is no way to treat a SO about anything, not just Christmas.  Whatever they do, it should be discussed and chosen together.", "It also seems strange to me to keep calling it \"his\" tradition when she participated in it willingly for 7 years (and, by her account, only stopped because of the pandemic and babies.) How many years does it take before you consider something you do together annually your tradition as well?   \n\n\nThis doesn't read so much like there is some wonderful other tradition she's giving up or not able to start, just that she doesn't want him to have THIS tradition because it's slightly inconvenient.", "[removed]", "No.\n\n\n\nThe guests are strangers. You dont leave your kids with complete unvetted strangers.\n\n\n\nSoup kitchens are utilized by all kinds of people. Some are wonderful, lovely people. And some are sex offenders who can't find housing because of their charges and are subsequently homeless.\n\n\n\nIt is a mixed bag of people utilizing social services and all of them are worthy of assistance and respect. That does not mean they are worthy of providing child care or appropriate for interacting with children.\n\n\n\n\nThe kids should volunteer when they are old enough for it to be meaningful to them and safe. Mostly safe.", "Yeah, that's a hard no. I doubt that is even allowed. The soup kitchens and homeless shelters near me require all volunteers to be adults. Even teens under 18 are not allowed to volunteer there. It's a safeguarding risk. You cannot just allow random adult community members, who have not been vetted for safety clearances, to have access to children as part of their usage of a community service. In all likelihood, allowing OP's children there would be against the rules of the soup kitchen, and would only be allowed \"off the books\" because the husband's mother has been volunteering there for so long. \n\nI would never allow my children to be involved in an activity like this, especially so young. OP needs to put on her big girl pants and veto her children being taken to this activity.", "It sounds like husband isn\u2019t expecting OP to go with him. He and his mom are planning to go and take the kids.", "I wouldn\u2019t want my kids to be interacting with the homeless people.  With Covid, the Flu, and other illnesses I wouldn\u2019t want my very young kids to be around people who are probably not vaccinated.  If mom is busy she might not be able to give the kids the attention they need.  Plus not everyone likes kids, especially if they are screaming or crying", "Go see my comment to OP after she provided requested info.", "There does seem to be some one-sided info. She married him, fully aware of his tradition, seemingly never indicating that she had a problem with it. Hopefully, they can work it out. IMO, it\u2019s a wonderful tradition to pass on to one\u2019s children, who can fully participate in the future.", "Is there context I'm missing other than:\n\n\"Ever since we started dating in 2012 up until we had our first child in 2019 I also participated in this Christmas tradition. The tradition is volunteering at a super kitchen on Christmas morning and into the afternoon help set up breakdown and feed the homeless.\"\n\nAnd did I say theyd be cooking the meals? No. I said distracted parents and kids in/near kitchens dont mix. \n\nReading comprehension is hard. I think [this](https://bookriot.com/improve-your-reading-comprehension/) might help <3", "Yeah\u2026 or even people who are not at risk of physically harming the children could still be dealing with substance abuse issues or untreated mental illness that makes them behave in ways that could startle/upset the children. I began volunteering at a soup kitchen when I was maybe 7 or 8, but my grandmother kept me by her side the whole time, in advance my parents had explained to me about how some people might behave strangely (I have extended family members who struggle with mental illness and substance abuse so I already had an age-appropriate understanding), and I only worked in the back helping on a sandwich assembly line. \n\nA 2 and a 4 year old don\u2019t really have the capacity to understand what might cause a stranger to act out if they\u2019re drunk or high or in withdrawal or having a breakdown. It\u2019s an unfortunate fact of life that sometimes toddlers *do* see those things, and then the adults in the room have a responsibility to mitigate the effect, but that should be after a worst case scenario. Plus, in hindsight, I was brought in because my grandmother was watching me all day during the summer and it was her church group that was volunteering that shift, so they found a job for me, but even an 8 year old was probably a little more underfoot than they wanted. Two toddlers are just going to be in the way. \n\nAnd, to your point, normally I\u2019m all about the whole \u2018stranger danger is overblown and the vast majority of abuse is committed by a family member or friend\u2019 but you do make a good point that because of housing restrictions and work restrictions, previously convicted sex offenders might make up a greater than average percentage of that population. While some studies show that recidivism in sex offenders is pretty low, they also show that many people who reoffend do it when they\u2019re under high stress situations, and being homeless or unable to afford food definitely qualifies as high stress. So\u2026 Yeah, as a former child soup kitchen volunteer, I wouldn\u2019t bring toddlers.", "Even if they were housed, not suffering any ill health (physical or mental) and all joyful about the prospect of kids being there, it's still a bad idea. Unless there is someone full time assigned to mind the kids, it's way too easy for accidents to happen as everyone thinks someone else is looking after the kids.", "The person you\u2019re replying to is imagining a very hallmark version of a soup kitchen.", "It\u2019s entirely possible that some of the people using the soup kitchen are on probation that includes requirements to stay away from kids. The presence of the OP\u2019s kids would prevent those people from seeking a hot meal on Christmas. Just a terrible idea all around.", "The homeless populations are more vulnerable for illnesses because of a lack of health care and exposure to the elements in unsanitary conditions.\n\n\n\n\nEmployees at agencies that work with the homeless are routinely screened for TB.  Because it is still common particularly in the homeless populations.\n\n\n\n\nAffordable Healthcare or universal Healthcare and affordable housing are needed everywhere.  Some areas are reaching levels we haven't seen in years.", "Yep work with homeless.  Hard to find housing for sex offenders. Really really hard."]}
