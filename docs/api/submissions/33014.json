If there are other days that they could volunteer on, perhaps suggest one of those. If the kitchen doesn't usually serve food except on the holidays, you are probably SOL.", "NTA. This would be an excellent tradition when the children are older. For the ages they're at now, Christmas is a magical time and it should be about them, at home with family. It's understandable that you would want to build your own traditions with them while they're young.\n\nIt's worth noting that your husband and his mom have been doing this for 20+ years, and he's 39 years old. So he didn't start doing it until he was well into his teens. Point out to him that he wasn't spending Christmas in soup kitchens when he was 2 and 4 years old.", "NAH. Just explain what you did here: the kids are too young and will be a distraction while trying to do the volunteering. You want him to skip it this year and have a Christmas at home with his children this year. \n\nMaybe he and his mother will agree to volunteer a different day and she can join you at your home for dinner?\n\nMy situation is different, but I have to juggle between my house, my sister's, my Dad's, and my in-laws'. We end up doing something different every year to keep everyone happy. Traditions are wonderful, but at the moment this one needs to be temporarily adjusted.", "NAH you can create your own tradition around your husband\u2019s schedule.\nYou don\u2019t have to join him and the children don\u2019t have to go unless they are old enough to help and want to participate.\nOpen gifts Christmas Eve or get up early and do gifts. Start a tradition of you and the kids going to a movie or playing board games or visiting other family until two. Y W B T A if you force him to quit", "NAH.  He can go if he wants, but the kids going should be by mutual agreement.", "NTA. How is he going to serve food AND watch the kids. Nope, too many things could go wrong and also exposing the kids to so many strangers where you know at least some are ill.", "NAH\n\nHe and his mom can and should go, it\u2019s their tradition and it\u2019s important to them and is very nice. When the kids are older it will be a great lesson for them to learn as well. \n\nBUT you\u2019re right. The kids are too young, your husband and MIL will be busy helping, and they\u2019re trying to take kids around A BUNCH of complete strangers and food prep. I can\u2019t imagine being that fucking stupid.", "NTA.  It's  time you had your own family traditions. Your kids are definitely too young to go. Who will be watching them while he and his mother do the serving and break down. I don't imagine it makes you feel good to be left out on Christmas day. You need to have a serious talk about how all this makes you feel. If he doesn't care, he shouldn't be a father and husband.", "NTA. You are his family now. The one he chose. It\u2019s time for new traditions. Maybe when the kids are older they can serve at a soup kitchen. They are at the age where they need fun traditions and to experience Christmas with family.", "There are so many things wrong with your husband's plan. First of all, So your kids are going to spend 3 hours in the car on the way to and from the soup kitchen, on Christmas day? And then at the soup kitchen they will be there for hours, doing what? Getting in the way? Being bored out of their minds? And, through all of this, they will be interacting with countless random adults who are service users of the soup kitchen who do not have safety clearances to be around your kids? \n\nIf your husband returns around 2 pm with the kids, this means that the majority of Christmas Day will be spent on \"his\" tradition. Most of the daytime will be gone by the time they get home, and you'll be left with the \"witching hour\" when your kids are exhausted and cranky for \"your\" traditions. This is completely unfair to you. \n\nIt's nice to help out the community with good works. But your children are also part of your husband's community and right now his primary obligation is to them. Children only get one childhood. It's ok for your efforts to be spent on their happiness.", "NAH to tell him that, no.", "INFO: What alternative are you suggesting instead?", "NAH he's not going to be able to do much of the work he usually does with a 2 and 4 year old around though. They aren't at the age that they can be left unsupervised so what is he planning on doing with them.", "I love his Christmas tradition but understand why you want to start your own family's traditions as well.\n\nOne thing he might want to consider: can he go and volunteer Christmas Eve or another day that week with his Mom (and with the kids when they're older)? Many people volunteer on Christmas but soup kitchens really need volunteers the rest of the year. Maybe he and his Mom can volunteer once a month and ask the soup kitchen they work with what they need.\n\nIf you host Christmas celebrations at your house and he doesn't arrive until 2 pm  guess who is going to have to do ALL the prep by themselves every single year?", "INFO:  How was this handled pre-pandemic? Did you ride along?", "NAH. I think it is time y\u2019all sit down and discuss what traditions you want for your family. Maybe Christmas Eve at your house and if you do Santa then early Christmas morning. Then off to the Soup Kitchen. Compromise is Key!", "NAH but I think it would be easy to integrate your new traditions with his old one. You don't have to open gifts on the 25th. You could always start a tradition where your kids open gifts on Christmas Eve and Christmas is reserved for the soup kitchen.", "NTA for telling him.  But that doesn't mean he won't go. What he is doing is a good thing.  Christmas is supposed to be about giving.", "I don\u2019t know what I would call this\u2026 I\u2019m wavering between E S H and N A H\n\nI would truly be surprised if a soup kitchen were willing to have kids that young participate in this activity. I\u2019ve looked for many family volunteer opportunities along food kitchens/pantries and most places require kids to be several years older than 2 and 4. \n\nI think it\u2019s unfair that you would be left alone without your family for most of the day on Christmas due to a medical condition that makes long road trips painful. \n\nAnd who wants to spend 90 minutes minimum one way in a car for the kids to be bored as soon as they get there? What if your kids are blunt in the way most young children are and they say something unintentionally hurtful to the people being served?\n\nOn the other hand, why can\u2019t you find some sort of tradition that works around the soup kitchen? Do some presents Christmas Eve (when I was young we were allowed to open one present the night before) or wake up earlier on Christmas morning for presents, have a morning of baking with the kids and playing with their toys, and then when your husband gets home you can do dinner?", "NTA\n\nThis will *ruin* Christmas for your children.", "I think they are too young to be introduced to this tradition and I would use that as your main argument. \n\nI do however think you shouldn't stop this tradition for him or his mother and in the future your children should be 100% included. \n\nYou two just need to communicate.", "Nah", "NTA. It sounds like his tradition is negatively affecting you pretty badly. You have medical issues and hes besically been abandoning you to look after two young kids alone (to volunteer sure but it isnt like its going to burn down if he isnt there) and also causing you to bounce from house to house. The argument ends at medical issues. You are not an accessory TO his family, you ARE his family. If you and the kids can't go he doesnt need to either until the kids are old enough to either go or not be so challenging at home. He kind of sounds like a mommas boy and like he needs a reminder that his priorities lie with his wife and children, not his mother. Maybe he can go another day if it's that important, but you have a right to an enjoyable and accessible Christmas.\n\nEDIT: I misread, he's not abandoning the kids he's taking them with him which is so much better. Young kids do great in kitchens where the adults watching them are distracted, I'm sure the heating elements, knives, and other things wont be an issue. Im also sure the kids wont wander off either and will be properly supervised the whole time.", "Eh\u2026. You\u2019re a mild a-hole. It isn\u2019t unreasonable to have your own Christmas traditions but to insist he get rid of his is pretty crappy. Volunteering is a great way to bond as a family and teach your children how to be good human beings. Volunteer with your family and find your own tradition that happens on Christmas Eve or on the Christmas Day afternoon.", "NAH,  that would be a long day for the kids.  Sounds like you and husband need to communicate better.  I also understand that you want to start new traditions with you husband and kids.", "Slight YTA for wanting him to stop what he is feels good doing on a day when so many go without. However, you can ask him to wait until your kids are older to go and help.", "Esh - I don't think this is about a tradition only.  It's about giving back and it is probably deeply meaningful to him. For him, Christmas can be shared, giving back and celebrating at home so a win-win.  If everyone thought like you and the people who say he can do another day - then there would be noone helping on Christmas.  Your husband is doing something good for people  and he isn't hurting you or kids by starting Chrsitmas later or by having kids join him.  I suggest rather than wanting your own traditions  - you so miss the point of what he is doing - you find a compromise with him.  Be prepared though because if it is in heart to volunteer and serve others he may not want to change.  I respect your husband!  What I would not respect is if he didn't celebrate with you/kids at all.  Until you've been in a position if need you can never understand the good that he is doing - you wouldn't want to change it if you knew.", "INFO: is it possible for your family (including his mother, if she wants) to start your own tradition in this spirit of this one?", "Reading your post, it sounds nice and yes you want to start new family traditions.  But reading your explanation why you might be the ah, yes, YTA.  You dont force anyone to give up their tradition, let alone a SO who has been doing something with his mother for 20 years.  Why does he have to stop?  Cant you blend traditions, start new ones around his?  It should be a discussion, especially with kids.  Have the kids open Santa gifts before they go.  Then family gifts when they come back.  Start making family dinner while they're gone and have a beautiful meal together Christmas night.  Endless possibilities.  So many people complain that Christmas has become too commercial and kids dont get the meaning, that its all about what they get.  Well here is a ready opportunity to teach them and you want to rip it away because....", "Slightly YTA because you should have discussed plans with him BEFORE telling your family anything. I'd be extremely upset if my wife made plans AND told someone about those before discussing them with me, as much as she would be upset with me if I were to do the same. Every year we need to compromise between Christmas with my family or with hers (not close), usually we alternate and spend every other year with each, but despite this having become a habit, we always discuss plans together before telling anything anyone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It makes sense to focus on building traditions your kids can actually participate in, instead of them being a nuisance or liability at a soup kitchen. Homeless people are not tools to teach your young children, who are too young to learn from this anyway. Homeless folks are real people who deserve respect and also EFFECTIVE ADULT WORKERS to prepare and serve them food safely and efficiently. Your husband is being selfish & obtuse, he can volunteer on the 24th or 26th or literally any other day of the year at a kitchen.

Perhaps he could spend some time in the morning with the children and then, when they are playing with their toys, go do this, and then come back in the afternoon/for dinner to spend more time with the family?  I remember being a kid, I did not spend all day with my parents, I was busy playing with my new Lego or game or whatever.  They\u2019ll be okay if dad steps out.

But it's not unreasonable to say, \"your holiday tradition might need to be adjusted a bit so that we can create new traditions\".  Many families deal with this, obviously.  If you're all acting in good faith, then everybody figures out how to adjust so that everyone can get \\*something\\*, even though it's impossible for everyone to get exactly what they want. (Meaning: a couple with children have to figure out how to divvy up spending Thanksgiving and Christmas. It may not be possible for each set of grandparents to have the exact same Christmas morning with the grandkids that they had with their own kids. Everybody has to be willing to give a little, and accept compromises.)\n\nThat's the way it goes.

Finally we sat down to start presents in the late afternoon, I'd say 4.\n\nThere would be dishes of nuts, cheese and crackers, and shrimp cocktail, plus plenty of cookies, as long as more dessert, while we were opening and playing with our new toys.\n\nI presume my dad would go make a plate of leftovers for a more substantial dinner, but at that point everyone was so distracted.\n\nI could have happily forgone everything before 2pm on Christmas day, and been the happier for it...  not everyone has to center the holiday around the children opening presents first thing in the morning...\n\nnot to say my mother's ideal Christmas itinerary didn't have it's downsides...  just saying that there are ways for both parents to get what they want out of this holiday, they just needed to have talked about it and planned it together, weeks ago...  instead of the husband presuming he could throw out ideas at the last minute and OP thinking she didn't need to voice her desire to rearrange 20 years of tradition.\n\nThis conversation should have happen in October, 2-3 years ago.", "He said they would be back by 2PM? Have her family come from like 2PM-8PM or have her family come on Christmas Eve? Why does it need to be in the morning when they have an event he has done for 20 years and she has participated with him for 7 of those", "Yes, it\u2019s awful.\n\nStatistically speaking, more than a few of them will be in need of such kindness during at least one point in their lives.", "OP's husband hasn't moved on to other days.", "obviously volunteering is a great thing to do but loads of people volunteer on christmas. i don\u2019t want to say these people are definitely doing it for selfish reasons/to feel good about themselves, but it may not actually be helping these shelters in the way they really need. shelters/soup kitchens need help year round. and i\u2019m sure they need help in the days before christmas to prepare whatever christmas meal they give out. i don\u2019t see any reason why he couldn\u2019t volunteer on christmas eve or any other day in december. he could volunteer once a month if it\u2019s really important to him! \n\nif it\u2019s really about helping his community and instilling kindness and selflessness in his kids, there are other ways to do that.\n\nbeing married and having kids is a group project. you\u2019re supposed to be a team, develop traditions together\u2026 they both should be in agreement about how to celebrate a major holiday. OP shouldn\u2019t be alone half of christmas day.", "Damn your mom is a trooper! I'm exhausted just reading that lol!\n\nI think it's a little different though because bringing toddlers to church and a soup kitchen are very different. Also when OP said she told her family they were spending it at home I assumed it meant the extended family was also invited over so it's not just her and the kids being affected, but I admit I may have misunderstood.\n\nThey absolutely should have had this conversation long before December started this year, but the past 3 years have been super fucked up so I'll give them a pass on that, haha!", "Plus a 74 year old.  Not saying there aren\u2019t spry 74 year olds out there, but there\u2019s no way she can do the heavy lifting a 30-50 year old can do.", "Honestly this should have been hashed out BEFORE they had kids. I feel so bad for OP that her husband is prioritizing him and his mom\u2019s tradition over his actual wife and mother of his children. IMO this is really shitty if OP\u2019s husband and he needs to let his kids actually be kids on Christmas morning and be part of it but I also don\u2019t really know what OP expected.", "With regard to a woman's own small children, I think she has every right to say that her way should take precedence over her MIL's way. MIL had her turn to do Christmas her way with her child. Now it's OP's turn. Obviously the children's father (OP's husband) should not get sidelined either, but his vision of a proper Christmas basically hogs the best part of Christmas Day for his priorities, and places his mother as having more say in what the children do on Christmas day than the children's own mother, and that's why it's unfair to OP.", "plus, i don\u2019t think you can teach a kid to selfish by allowing them a fun day to open gifts and be with their loved ones. it\u2019s one day. i think every kid on the planet deserves at least one day where they are the center of their universe, don\u2019t you?", "It\u2019s definitely one sided. She stuck by him all those years doing \u201chis\u201d tradition with his mother, but once he had his own children he abandoned his wife and children to continue doing what he wants to do. It\u2019s very selfish. AND she had RSV the first Christmas wasn\u2019t able didn\u2019t go?  The story just gets worse and worse.", "Gilmore Girls also addresses this when Paris is looking for an opportunity to shine her high school resume.", "I can't imagine a soup kitchen ALLOWING those kids there unless they are in front to eat. No place that I've volunteered at allowed kids under 12. And waste time introducing the kids to everyone? Maybe if it is just a few minutes. But folks are busy on that day and don't have time to watch kids (which is what OP will be doing).", "Mom is supposed to hold two toddlers all day and watch while dad serves food? Ummm\u2026..no. They are far too young for it to be meaningful for them. Aaaaaand it puts the pressure on mom to entertain them at a soup kitchen and make sure that they don\u2019t get in the way or injure themselves. On Christmas morning, no less.\n\nThere are far better ways to involve children in service work in age appropriate ways. OP\u2019s husband is delusional if he thinks this is a gooidea.\n\nOP is NTA. Hubby should pick another day around the holiday to volunteer. When Their kids get older and are capable of contributing in a useful way, then he can bring them.", "I agree. \u201cHow do we spend the holidays?\u201d took up a full hour in our premarital counseling. It was an hour well spent.", "I would also worry about husband watching those kids carefully against injury around a kitchen, servers tripping over them, or their simply being safe around strangers (disappearing, assault, etc. happen on Christmas too). It\u2019s not fun for them, they can\u2019t touch anything or go anywhere. Nope, NTA.", "At least once, to be baptized!"]}
