My mom (F57) was a stay at home mom my entire life and she is still unemployed to take care of the house. She Loves to go on cruises and vacations, I mean as in two or more a year, three this year alone. This wasn't a problem until the last few years. \n\tFor those that don't know when you adopt children through the county or state, the government gives you monthly checks for each child, for food, shelter, general well-being stuff, my mom uses this money for her vacations. But once the child turns 18 the checks stop coming. Four our of the five of us kids are now over the age of 18 now so my mom is down to one check a month (1,500 dollars I think?) but she still Insists on going on these big vacations. \n\nShe's going on a one week cruise  next week with my Aunt, and another two week cruise at the end of October and she's quickly running out of money after paying her household bills and buying groceries (both of which my siblings that have jobs and I will help her out with).\nHere's where I might be the asshole, she asked for \"Rent money\" from me after complaining about her lack of vacation funds and I asked if she was going to use the money for her cruise, to which she said Yes. And in response I said \"The cruise solely being funded by the money you get from the government for adopting kids?\" \nShe blew up, said it was the rudest thing I could have said to her and then stormed off, she's now not talking to me and I feel like a massive dick. I didn't intend to hurt her feelings, and have no problem paying rent if it goes to the household, but I don't want to just give her money for one of her three yearly cruises. \n\nSo I have to ask, Am I the Asshole for telling my mom her cruises are funded by the government?\n\nEdit:  clearing some things up, I dont live here free, I do help pay towards utilities and food and she wants me to give her money for her cruise on top of that amount and called it rent, hence the quotes. Out of the five of us siblings I'm the only one with a stable job and my older brother jumps between jobs a lot and can't pay household things as regularly, hope this clears some things up, I'm about to go to work but I'll keep replying in the comments as much as I can", "created_utc": 1694458413, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16g3pqx/aita_for_telling_my_mom_her_cruises_are_funded_by/", "score": 224, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If we were to foster or adopt I would make certain that all of the child\u2019s needs were met and if there was anything left after that I would invest it into the child\u2019s future. Our oldest is setting an example for her younger siblings by being dual enrolled in high school and college right now. That being said, I\u2019m sure her bills were less than the $7,500 she got from the government each month. It is her decision to allow the children to continue to reside in the home. If she wants or expects rent money from those who are there I would suggest a rental agreement that states exactly what is a fair rate and the bills to be split in equal parts for all adult members. Food is a bill and if it\u2019s going to be shared then that can be split also. The youngest sibilant should have their needs met before any vacations are booked and paid for. If the mother can no longer afford these things then she simply can not go. My mother is in her 60\u2019s and to this day would give a free place to live, not ask for money with bills, and provide food for my two bio children and myself if I ever needed it.

Your mom wasn't the asshole until she was down to one check, and the kid that check is supposed to support is suffering. Sure, you and anyone else over 18 should be kicking in, but it sounds like you are. As long as I was covering my share of utilities and food/incidentals, I would not expect my parents to want extra just for taking up space. I guess if my parents were desperate, maybe. I probably would have offered before they asked, but for a vacation? When she's had more than one already this year, and she has a kid already going without or being covered by young adult siblings? It's gross and she's an asshole.", "NTA. OP,  honey, you have every right to ask how your money was spent. Your parents are accountable for it to you and the government. \n\nIt sounds like for most of this time your parents were receiving 6000 per month just for y'all's care, in addition to your father's earnings. You should have been very well cared for indeed! \n\nI suggest you ask your social worker or the department that administers your funds how to get an accounting.\n\nAnd ignore anyone who tries to guilt you about it.  The money was for your maintenance and education, and was not any sort of payment or reward for your parents. You are absolutely entitled to know how it was spent.\n\nWhen you know that, you'll have a better idea how to proceed with future plans.", "I have never been in your situation but I can relate. \n\nMy mother was getting a huge amount of money off my dad for child support. Me and my 3 brothers all slept in the same tiny tiny room and often had nothing in the cupboards. Her friends would buy us groceries and she would make us say thank you and hug them. She shopped and spent like she was a Kardashian, 800$ boots, whatever she wanted. \n\nWhen I was about 11-12 I saw the weekly check my dad was giving her. I was shocked. Within a month or two I had a big blow up with her and moved to my dad's full time. \n\nSome people treat kids like a paycheck. \n\nIt sucks but that's life. Some people are narcissistic enough to just think only about themselves.", "Without seeing all the accounting at play hard to say.\n\nIf she had worked, but then had to pay childcare, may have been a loss.  So she saved money through her labor.  Maybe she also spent a load of time coupon clipping or whatever saving money.  If all your needs were seen to, and there is also income from your dad, may math out.\n\nI\u2019ve actually met people who essentially did cruises as retirement as it was cheaper than moving to a 50+ community with same benefits.  \n\nBasically really don\u2019t want to assume anything without ALL details", "After reading through comments, I'm rolling with NTA. But also nunya - as in none of your business, at least until your sibling is being neglected. How she managed her finances isn't your business, it doesn't matter if the specific dollar notes given to her were used for you or not, what matters is that the kids are looked after. \n\nBut now you are seeing your brother neglected, this becomes your business. \n\nWhat's she gonna do when the last one dries up?
