I have an older brother 28 (we will call Alex) and an older sister 25, I\u2019m f 22.Though my mom did all she could we had it really rough. \n\nI left at 17 since then I have been able to take a step back. My brother has always been really difficult. Alex wanted to stay home and become a professional gamer. \n\nAlex never graduated. He met a girl on Tinder (let\u2019s say Emmie) and they got married. I don't know how, but he managed to find someone just as lazy and cruel as himself. Though they are both now almost 30 they have never had a job, never paid a bill, and never contribute to the house. My mother has a certified family care home where she cares for residents 24/7, they live in the house. Alex and Emmie do not help. \n\nOn top of that they, especially, Emmie are incredibly overweight. They eat my mother out of a house and home. Emmie will come downstairs and make themselves six sandwiches and whatever else she can fit in her arms. I promise you I am not exaggerating. When Alex and Emmie fight she will go into one of my mom's guest rooms and make a mess in there and leave.My mother does caring for 4 elderly and dying residents she has to go back and clean up after Emmie.\n\nEmmie and Alex got themselves a husky puppy. This dog is awful, it is not trained. My brother started putting it in a vest and now claims it is his service dog to stop him from picking at his nails. Don't get me wrong I have a service dog because of a real disability, my dog has been trained. His dog has attacked my dog.   \n\n\nOne day Emmie left her room went to a guest room and her dog pee on the bed. Instead of cleaning it up she just went into another room. My mom found it days later, the bed was ruined. They started door dashing, they always took my mom's car and left it trashed and on empty. She asked them why and they said because they didn't want to make a mess of their car (a car my mom gave them). One of my mom's resident even died and she asked them to watch the residents so she could go to the funeral and they said no, so I left college for a few days and drove 8 hours to watch the residents. While they were just upstairs.   \n\n\nMy mom calls me crying all the time about the way they treat her. I listen to what they do and give her advice. I know they will be happier if they leave and experience what it is like to have a real life. My mom never does anything. \n\n\nMy mom is now married. She is doing IVF and asked Emmie and Alex to watch the residents so her husband can be there for the implantation. They said no. My mom called me crying heartbroken. After her last story I told her that she was allowing abuse to happen. I said she was ruining their lives and letting them be a tumor on everyone. I asked her not to talk to me about the issues she had with them anymore if she wasn't going to do anything.

I understand well actually I don\u2019t understand how the love of a mother makes them care for them that much to the point where they become essentially useless meme era of society. They probably don\u2019t have any abilities they\u2019d be able to contribute to society.\n\nMy GFs mom is somewhat similar as in she lets her grown ass son live in a trailer they own and the son will disrespect her and her husband and sometimes he\u2019ll leave because he can finally afford to and a couple months later he\u2019ll come back and be a bum again. He has two kids with different women and still doesn\u2019t get off his ass to do anything. It just baffles me how merciful they can be. \n\nBest your mom can do is allow them to stay and attain some skill they can use for a job or to get a job and if that isn\u2019t happening buh bye. Homeless or not. They\u2019re grown ass lazy adults.", "Your mother needs to deal with these burdens on her and society. Whilst ever she allows them, they will freeload.
