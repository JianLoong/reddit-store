A healthy relationship can withstand each having their own separate interests separately. Neither should have to endure the others' interest in the name of bonding. If she wants to spend time with you, it can be a joint activity and she can watch her show later.", "NTA - Sometimes you just can't stand a particular singer, actor or person or the overall movie or show and it sucks for you.  Wanting not to be there is no bad reflection on you about your feelings for a person that doesn't have the same feelings.  And you are not ruining her weekend as she says or being disrespectful to her at all, you just don't share her liking that show.  Tell if you are disrespecting her for not watching with her, she is equally disrespecting you for making you stay and watch with her for something you hate.", "NTA. \n\nShe had a choice: She could spend time with you watching something you both agreed on or she could watch that specific show alone. She doesn't get to demand you watch something you hate and toss manipulative bullshit at you when you refused. That isn't quality time; it's a hostage situation.", "NTA. I absolutely hate those shows too, and refuse to watch or even listen to them. It\u2019s not like you said you were going to leave the house and get shit faced drunk and go to a strip club.", "NTA, but you could consider noise cancelling headphones + audiobooks if you do want to hang with her (that's what I use when husband wants to watch one of his stupider YouTube channels and I want to be in the same room).\n\nOr she could pick a show you both like, like a normal person.", "Nta- I don\u2019t like listening to when my husband plays video games but he enjoys them. So while he plays, I cuddle with him and scrolling on my phone, sometimes watch something on Hulu.\n\nHowever, time alone is also important in a relationship. I have shows that I watch on my own while my husband watches or play a game in the other room.\n\n\nNext time you should suggest a different show to watch. If she compromises & says yes, then you know she really does want to spend time with you. Then the next time you can compromise & watch it with her.", "NTA. I don't like half the shows that my SO does. So when they're on, I just go into another room and do my own thing until the show is over. Then we find something to do together. No fuss, no muss.", "Nta", "NTA. She\u2019s overreacting. She isn\u2019t 5. She doesn\u2019t need someone to sit with her to watch terrible trashy telly. If she wants to change it to something you\u2019d both enjoy, okay. You didn\u2019t ask her to not watch it - you were going to go watch something if interest you you. If she wants to spend time together, I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re more than willing\u2026 just not involving that show. She needs to get over it.", "NTA\n\nWhat's the point of being in the same room if you're not watching the same thing? When people say \"spending time together\" it's supposed to be more than literally having time elapse while you're existing in the same room.

She also wants to spend her time doing something she loves with the person she loves, even if that person is doing something else her only request is they are present. \n\nThis may not seem like a big deal to you, but do this enough and there\u2019s a chance she might decide to find someone who *will* spend time with her while she does the things she loves.", "E S H.

It just doesn't make much sense to me why not doing this would be a big issue with her. we aren't looking, conversing with, or even hearing each other at that point.
