You've expressed that you dislike this show to the point of not even wanting to hear it, so why can't she put off watching it for a while so you guys can hang out like she wants to? Both of you win, nobody gets forced to do something they don't want. And like you said, putting off quality time for 1 hour really isn't bad.

In this instance she made herself the asshole, because she pushed to the point of making serious accusations of mistreatment from you when she was effectively mistreating you on the basis of not wanting to watch something else or watch something alone. Her problem was the most easily fixed by compromise, but she chose to be hard headed about it.\n\nI also wouldn't call your push back as \"stupid\" by compare, because you're entitled to boundaries and standards of what you consume even if it doesn't gel with what your wife feels.", "NTA I'm married to something similar. It's a narcissistic behavior- she wants to control you and force you to conform to her world and not adapt to yours. Keep your boundaries and remind her that you have no interest in the show and if she expects you to use your PC. You are not really spending time \"together\" but rather just spending time in the same vicinity.\n\nYou could ask a lot of dumb questions, make a lot of noise, just outright criticize everything about the show and anyone who watches it. You'll get uninvited pretty quickly.", "NTA There are certain shows and games my kids play/watch that I can\u2019t stand. Even they know I\u2019m not gonna sit and listen to that crap. They will actively avoid putting the annoying things on while we\u2019re in the living room together. And they\u2019re children.", "NTA.  You don't want that inflicted upon you.  If she really wants to spend time with you, she can do it when something else is on.", "NTA\n\nIf she cared so much about the show, she needed to watch it and leave you free to do what you wanted.\n\nIf she cared so much about starting the weekend with you, she needed to walk away from the tv and either (1) do something that you both wanted to do or (2) be the one to \"watch something on the computer while she enjoyed your company as you watched something you wanted to watch\" - point here. if she didn't think she'd enjoy doing exactly what she was expecting you to do, she should not expect it of you.\n\nYou aren't the one who ruined anything. She was by insisting that she do what she wants AND that she get to insist you do what she wants you to do. That is not how couples enjoy time together.", "NTA.  Back when I first married my husband we were really into watching a Turkish show together that had Arabic subtitles only.  My husband was obsessed with the show and he would tell me all the ins and outs of the action and it was a cool bonding experience. \nSo cool in fact that eventually we went to Istanbul just to hang out on the streets of Turkey ourselves.  So...my advice is dont cave into your wifes demands of watching Jersey shore or you might end up in New Jersey.  Do pick a foreign show and watch it together .", "NTA. Should go nc for a bit for sure.", "Uhhhh\u2026 Is she always like this? \n\nYou are NTA but she\u2019s really reaching here. How are you treating her poorly because you don\u2019t want to sit around listening to something you don\u2019t like?

She likes a show, you don't. She wants to watch it, you don't. You don't have to watch the show together. If she wanted to spend time with you, doing something you both enjoy is the rational thing. Not this \"Watch this show you hate with me\" BS.", "NTA. OP, my husband and I have shows we watch together and shows we watch separately. I'll watch dumb comedies and some reality TV when he's not around, he watches sports when I'm not around, and we have our shows together. Maybe suggest that as a compromise.", "I get wanting to be in the same room as your SO. However, there is a limit or boundary about that. I would feel the same as OP if my SO wanted to watch horror movies. I can't handle them. Almost anything else I could hang out and play on my phone while SO watches their show EXCEPT for horror movies/shows. That is a hard nope.", "There is no compromise that would ever see me watching one of these mindless reality shows.  If OP feels a similar way, it's a non-starter.", "Sounds to me like \"quality time\" might be her biggest love language. It doesn't matter, to her, what each of you are actually doing, so long as you're doing together when you're each doing your things. \n \nThe problem is the specific show. Which, personally, I believe to be a fucking blight of television. \n \nTell her that you find that particular show absolutely repulsive on a few levels, and that you would love to spend time next to her doing separate things, but Jersey Shore is a boundary you need to maintain for your own sanity. It's not her, it's the fucking Jersey Shore trolls."]}
