Without saying too much, my parents had me while they were in college and i lived with my grandparents until they graduated and got married. I have three younger siblings and we all live in a large city together. My dad has a real job and my mom basically just writes a blog and has social media accounts. She NEVER mentions me. I'm never in pictures. My siblings are because they were written about from the time my mom was pregnant with them, after they got married. She writes a lot about our \"lifestyle\" and brags about how thrifty she is and simple but she doesn't tell people that my grandparents give us money and that she blows it on really expensive things like buckets and sweaters. Trust me when I say that NONE of what you see online about my family is true except for where we live and our names. Anyway, I vented a little bit to my friend about how my parents go back and forth on pretending to be poor but then not and then back again, depending on who they talk to. And i said that sometimes that meant that my mom buys something expensive and stupid to brag about but then I have to hear about eating less or being \"more simple\" about birthday wishlists because life is too expensive. So we made a Tiktok at my house. I pointed out stuff like \"here's my mom's ONE sweater that cost $400 and that's why i got this for Christmas\" and pointed to a kid's art set. I pointed out some stuff that she told her readers she was gifted that she actually bought, too. My Tiktok doesn't get much attention at all but one of my friend's showed it to her mom and her mom showed my mom. My parents are mad and say that doing stuff like this hurts the whole family because it could affect sponsorships and maybe book deals and Dad said i was an asshole for doing the video. So, am I? I think I have a right to say the truth but maybe I should have kept it more private between me and my friends. By the way, they made me delete the account so no one else is going to know.

Also, remember they could kick you out once you turn 18. So I hope that TikTok of yours takes off or you have some money saved up.

I won't post about it again on social media but thank you for voting NTA!", "Thank you for voting. I'm not worried about being kicked out. My grandparents are still really involved, especially with me. That's how I got to go to my aunt's house.

She likes things from Europe and belives that the old way is the best way to she always talks about like buckets and a mop with rope being better than a swiffer and then buys a bucket that's like $300 from England.
