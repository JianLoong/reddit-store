Your income supports your family. This is an HR issue for a VOLUNTEER position.\n\nYour husband needs to like the volunteering enough to take feedback and correct himself.

It\u2019s not your job to keep him from flying off the handle.", "INFO: Why does your husband need you, a person not affiliated with the organization he is voulnteering with, to go to his HR meeting?", "YWNBTA - so your husband wants you to come to his HR meeting, not because his stroke affected his memory a year ago, but because he needs your help not to be a dick? Which has been his problem since way before the stroke? Jesus... if he hasn't learned how to play well with others by now, it ain't gonna happen. And how does assisting him wiggle out of being held accountable for his behaviors help anyone? It's just enabling him to continue being an AH to everyone...\n\nThink about this, you say his clients love him, right? That means he *knows* how to not to be a dick... i.e. he just can't be bothered not to be a dick to everyone else.", "NTA. If other volunteers don\u2019t want to work with him then there\u2019s nothing you can do. The decision mostly likely has already been made. He needs to look inside of himself for the solution. He\u2019s fifty it\u2019s time for him to grow up.", "Why would the business let you, (an outsider,) in the meeting? NTA. And honestly if I was the supervisor, I'd offer you coffee or water and then sit you in an alcove anyway.", "INFO: Why does he want you there?", "NTA- Harsh as it sounds messing this up might be the wake up call he needs. If you're so obnoxious in the work place that people won't even take you for free, it's time to seek help.", "NTA. You're not his therapist or his mother. He needs the former to teach him how to human.", "NTA. You are not his mother and this is not a parent/teacher conference. Wanting you there is weird. \n\nAlso, husband sounds like he has major issues he\u2019s not working to improve, and your frustration is turning to resentment. His behavior needs to change or your marriage needs to change.", "YTA \n\nOP\u2019s husband had a stroke and his memory is bad because of it so he might forget what to say. He\u2019s also a military vet of 20 years and hasn\u2019t had access to therapy because of delays in VA. \n\nOP - what happened to in sickness and health huh? \n\nHe\u2019s been at this job for 18 months without incident and by your own admission has been trying really hard to do better.

This is so inappropriate and completely unfair to the person who made the complaint. You will be the asshole if you go and possibly already are for digging him out of problems with previous people who have complained.", "NTA\n\nIt would be inappropriate for him to have a family member present for an HR discussion about an event that the family member wasn't present for.  He likely knows what he said or did that upset the other person.  He should apologize for any upset and explain it wasn't intentional.", "I won\u2019t loose any income, just possibly might not get the granted a few hours off with the next favour I ask.  \n\nI do also think that he is a grown up and should be able to manage himself.  But then did he ask because he actually has insight and wants to do better?", "Because he has a habit of not thinking before talking, getting defensive and failing to see his error (until someone he knows well points out his fault).  He wants to keep volunteering in this organisation, so he doesn\u2019t want stuff it up. \n\nHe had a stroke last year, and his memory isn\u2019t great.  He was told he could have someone with him.", "His current job he has been in for 18 months without incident.  And he has been trying.  He is genuinely disappointed that this has occurred, and he truely has no idea what he has said or done.  \n\nBut your point still are all valid, and I\u2019m tired of doing this - although it had been a couple of years since the last incident", "Its common \u2026. Even in corporate settings that you can bring an advocate with you to such meetings.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking too. Plus multiple companies refusing to hire him?", "If he has insight, he can implement it by himself. If he doesn\u2019t have any insight, this is a great opportunity for him to learn and gain some, if at all possible. (Though it sounds like he won\u2019t gain any and won\u2019t change.) Either way, stop bailing him out and go to your actual job.", "He can write things down so he doesn't forget. And I am assuming his personality didn't change because of the stroke? In that case, he can learn the hard way that he needs to change and accept feedback. If he's not willing to do that, I'm afraid he's going to keep losing positions, even the ones he likes.", "So you don't want to be supportive and help him not screw up and even though he can have someone there you don't want to show that support. IMO, if you can get off with no issue, YTA.", "Is he in therapy?", "This is my understanding as well. I attended a supervisor training workshop series a while back, and people from multiple companies talked about their HR processes. Almost all allowed advocates, although for some if an employee brought an attorney, the company would do the same.", "No, his personality has changed because of the stroke.  But it has been a hard year for us all.  \n\nI think his personality is a combination of his Dad and Military for 20yrs.  His Dad is 100x worse.", "This is why I\u2019m torn.  I wont be penalised for going with him, but this isn\u2019t the first time and I\u2019m feeling a bit tired of it all.", "He is on the waitlist for our equivalent of VA.  The delays are insane. It did take a while for him to understand that this is his problem not everyone else\u2019s.", "Glad he's on a wait list... but either way, you are allowed to be done, whether that's with him altogether or just with carrying him through these issues. Otherwise you are likely to grow resentful... or more resentful, depending on your current resentment status."]}
