{"id": 20514, "submission_id": "14ibg8c", "title": "AITA for reporting my coworker for drugging me?", "selftext": "I (29 F) went to an event for my work. It was an optional weekend trip and some other coworkers attended this trip. One coworker Wendy (37 F) came, and I considered her a really good friend. On one of the days of this trip, I let her know that there was a lot of issues I was having in my personal life and other work related stress. She was very sympathetic, and stated that she wanted to help relieve some stress. She then gave me this gummy and said that it would help. She made me think that it was melatonin, which I have used before and never really impacted me. 30 minutes after I took this gummy, I started feeling very lightheaded, room was spinning, I started slurring my words, and couldn't even keep my eyes open. I tried to keep myself upright for as long as I could, but feel over in my chair. I couldn't walk or stand up. I started to throw up constantly and they had to call 911 to take me to the nearest hospital. I ended up having to be in the hospital for a day and a half. For the rest of that weekend, I stayed at home and try to recuperate the best I could. The following Monday, I return to work still not feeling my best. Not even a half hour after I get to work, my boss calls me into her office and wants to speak with her, then me. They ask me what happened and specifically asked me if Wendy gave me a gummy. I say \"yes she did but she told me that it was melatonin.\" My bosses then told me that the gummy that Wendy gave me was man-made marijuana. I was shocked and got upset. Now I have never ever taken any form of drug, smoked, and I rarely drink. I gave my boss all the information that I could remember but i was still foggy. I went back to work and was told not speak about this incident to anyone. 15 minutes after I return to work, Wendy came to me asking \"wtf did you say to them?\" \"You need to tell me what you said.\" I told her that we are not supposed to be talking about this. She continued to ask me and I keep saying no. Throughout the day, she messages me and asks me what I said, admitting that she lied to our bosses saying she gave me ibuprofen, and that we both will lose our jobs. I do not talk to her, but I screenshot all of the chats just in case. Later on that day, we are sent on administrative leave by HR. I get called in and told them everything that happened with the screenshots. After a few days, HR tells me I can return to work. I am beyond relieved. All I know now is that Wendy does not have a job at the company. But she has many friends at the company, and they all are expressing hatred of me because she is no longer part of the company, even on social media. She has even texted me and threatened me. I have not spoken to anybody about what happened. I just want to move on. All I did was tell the truth about how she took advantage of me.", "created_utc": 1687663110, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ibg8c/aita_for_reporting_my_coworker_for_drugging_me/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also keep track of everything her friends are saying and actions they are taking toward you. If they are actually making it harder to do your job then I can be seen as retaliation.", "NTA\n\nShe was wrong period. \n\nBased on what your boss asked you, she has done it before too. I mean, they literally asked you if it was a gummy.\n\nBe safe.", "NTA, I\u2019m sure what Wendy did is actually considered illegal \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nShe should\u2019ve told you what was in the gummy. You told the truth, she made a mistake that cost her her job.", "NTA- although I love me some edibles, they aren\u2019t for everyone, and you certainly don\u2019t give them to people without their knowledge. I\u2019ve never heard of edibles doing this amount of damage to anyone though and I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s all that was in it. You can ask for you hospital records and for toxicity screens to make sure as well that nothing else was in there. That was reckless and dangerous of her to just give out to someone. Especially someone who has never done drugs in their life. I hope you\u2019re ok. But you could\u2019ve done more than just get her fired after that incident. She should\u2019ve paid for your hospital stay and expenses.", "Definitely NTA. I'm not sure where you live or if cannabis is legal there, but she shouldn't have lied to you. She should have told you what it was and asked if you wanted to try it. Medicinal marijuana products these days are extremely potent and if you're not used to them they can do exactly what that did to you. What she did was irresponsible and dangerous. I'm glad you still have your job and she got rightfully fired.", "NTA - you should also report to the company the threatening texts you are getting from her. And not knowing how the co-workers are expressing their hatred, it's hard to tell you what to do. But document it on your phone and perhaps a diary. It may be useful later. I'd probably also talk to my immediate supervisor - maybe not to have them do anything now, tell them it might make the situation worse, but to document your side.", "NTA that is not ok what she did to you. I\u2019m so petty I would walk by her friends, head held high, pun intended and say \u2018I\u2019m so glad I have my job and even got a raise\u2019.", "NTA - Fuck Wendy. She put you in danger. If I were you I would think about leaving that toxic workplace. That's insane!", "Also, don't take what someone hands you. Wendy did wrong but you should have been smarter. No one knows how anyone will react to anything.", "NTA-Nothing wrong with sharing an edible but she should have absolutely told you what it was before you ingested it. You need to know what you are putting in body.", "NTA you know you arnt, but I would be very very careful while at work, don't give in to the drama that she's stirring, as others have said just keep an eye and an ear out and if it's serious enough tell your HR IF! it will effect your work or is effecting it. If it if her outside of work harassing you, threatening you, document and possibly give a ring to the non emergency line to ask them for advise on what's best to do to protect yourself from harm and if you don't already I would get a camera or two for your home and car to just have an eye in the sky for extra protection and evidence if you see her or ger goons show up.", "NTA! What she did could have seriously harmed you, not knowing if you have any medical conditions, or medications you are taking, especially if that gummy wasn\u2019t really the just marijuana/thc.

I\u2019m not sure why she passed out, she did take her meds while she was there (she was in our group) she was fine until she wasn\u2019t all of sudden as we got on the bus to go home. We had to sit there an hour til her parents came and got her and they gave her an emergency shot of something that was in her medical bag."]}
