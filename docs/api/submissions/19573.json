The timing of your decision to reveal your relationship could have been a bit better, but especially with you being gay, I can understand your hesitancy in doing so. \n\nNow if this would have been a normal cishet relationship, then I'd be more likely to believe you're an AH, but I think a lot of people are glossing over how hard it is for LGBT people to reveal their relationships. \n\nCould you have waited to reveal your relationship? Yes. However, I can also understand wanting to attend the wedding as a couple, as opposed to just \"in-laws.\" There's a certain freedom in being able to do small things like hold your partner's hand or even dance with them, that take a lot of guts for LGBT peeps like us. \n\nAlso, the \"in-laws\" welcoming you more than your sister says more about her than it does you IMHO. \n\nNow if you would have went and ran your mouth to them, then I'd say you were an AH, but you decided not to, which was NOT AH behavior. \n\nRegarding you being the \"golden child,\" that's a bit different. Even if you were the GC, that's your parent's fault, not yours. You did not force them to favor you, you were a fucking KID!

With your sister's reaction and general attitude, I wouldn't put it past her to try to badmouth you to her in-laws. I would have pondered saying something as well. I'm glad you didn't, though.

Your first instinct of ratting her out by lying (because she doesn\u2019t hold animosity towards the parents; it\u2019s towards you) is deeply cruel and indicates you are not a positive force in your relationship with your sister. You could\u2019ve talked to her. You could\u2019ve believed her that you were treated better when growing up. You could have generously validated her feelings now, but instead you want to pursue a hurtful course of action.  Would it be so hard for you to brainstorm how to help this situation instead of doing everything you can to make it worse??  Why not visit the parents and your significant others at the same time and you and sis can function as a team. For example, if she had a weird behavior that puts their family off then steer her away from it. Leverage your relationship with them to include her and make her feel welcome.  You\u2019re so darned mean for wanting to make her look bad to the Inlaws instead of being helpful", "INFO. I think it\u2019s telling that you\u2019re not telling us how EXACTLY your experience growing up was different from your sister\u2019s, even after she pointed it out to you.

You will seriously only widen the wedge and make family events unbearable for everyone. \n\nIt seems your BF was also the \"Golden Child\" in his family, so you two are going to have a hard time with any reconciliation with your sister and BIL unless they let go of that mentality and you and your BF don't act the part you have been type cast in to play.\n\nLet your sister stay mad or upset; you won't be able to change that. Keep your relationship out of hers and vice versa. In-laws don't need to know anything, and if you do, I am taking back my NTA and you would really be TMA.

It sounds to me like you're just generally a nicer person than your sister so they like having you around.

But a fucking month?", ">from the information here, you are the golden child. You even admitted that your parents were more lax with you. \n\nEh, I'm not sure I agree with that. Without getting too much into family dynamics, on my mums side I'm the eldest with two younger siblings. They definitely have always received a far more lax childhood. But our circumstances are far from the same. I'm Neurotypical and a pretty normal guy. My brother has ADHD/Autism, and isn't exactly suitable for a normal job involving people. My sister has had anxiety issues in the past, attempted to unalive herself a couple of years ago and while she's doing a lot better now, she's also pregnant. Just on mental health alone it makes complete sense that my mother was harder on me than them. Plus, let be honest here, eldest children are often used to test parenting ideas. By the time younger siblings arrive, they're better parents just through experience. For me personally, even with the less preferential treatment, me and my mother are probably closer in terms of relationship than either of my other siblings are and in all honesty she probably likes me more as a person than them. She definitely talks with me more and opens up in a way she wouldn't with my siblings.\n\nAll that is to say I don't think a difference in treatment is 100% full proof fact that the one getting better treatment is the golden child. The circumstances of that child could just be different. I'm not saying that OP wasn't the golden child, but there has to be more to it than the difference in the parents being more lax with him to say that. He comes across as immature and kinda child-like in mentality (I'm telling!), but there's nothing here confirming him as the golden child. Definitely TA in this situation, but I'm seeing this as more of a \"You're immature AF\" way.", "Um, no it\u2019s not.

This meant little sis always got more than either of us older ones, especially since their financial situation kept improving, so little sis always had more than we did at the same age.\n\nIn addition, I have AuDHD, a diagnosis that didn\u2019t even exist then (you could have one or the other, not both) and was forever getting into trouble because I didn\u2019t understand how I was supposed to behave. Middle sis is a drama queen (always was, always will be, and these days I adore her for it) and had a lot of LDs. Baby sis was and is a sweetheart, and was the easiest kid. So my parents were a lot easier on her due to her personality, her being an overall easier kid, and my parents being more experienced.\n\nBaby sis is the only Gen Z of us, so she was also reaching milestones in a very different world than we did.

The fact that op is a \u201cgolden child\u201d is irrelevant and although it makes his sister envious, that is entirely the fault of their parents. Had op actually ran and tattled he would undoubtedly be the AH but he didn\u2019t, so he\u2019s not.", "how is it OP's fault his parents and partner's parents seem to love him more? should he deliberately insult them so they love the sister more?\n\nsister is misdirecting her anger", "> just jealous of me and threatened by the way I completely take over and make myself the centre of attention. I can't help it if people like me more than her. Maybe I should explain to my in-laws that she's just really insecure and jealous?\n\nThat's a BINGO. Literally twisting her hurt into a weapon to use against her. He knew exactly what she meant by \"stealing her in laws\". His first instinct was to go gossip with his boyfriends family about his sister. So conniving.", "Does anyone else think that these two golden children were annoyed at being upstaged by the siblings' engagement and wedding, so their whole relationship is just a way to grab the attention back again?", "all he did was announce their relationship. how is that \"trumping\" his sister's wedding in any way? and the wedding was a whole month away lol\n\nit seems sister is having a case of 'main character syndrome'", "tbh if you at least continue the conversation or seem a little apologetic, that's the way to do it.\n\n\n\nand you didn't have a needle in their hip\n\n\n...right?", "Yes. And not just \u201cannouncing something.\u201d Announcing he\u2019s in a romantic relationship with his sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2019s BROTHER.  Who if he had any concept of boundaries he wouldn\u2019t be dating. He\u2019s creepily competitive w/ his sister. It\u2019s so important to him that her in laws like him best, he has to make damn sure she knows it?  What an asshole!", ">He also mentions that his parents work time consuming jobs so I bet that sister was the third parent which would explain the \u201c you stole my childhood \u201c\n\nThe actual quote was that he stole opportunities from her. I'm not exactly sure what that means, it could mean any number of things. But she never specifically said childhood unless OP clarified that in a reply? OP could have easily just grassed on his sister any time she tried to do something behind her parents back and thus that claim still holds water does it not? \n\n>You\u2019re opinion is formed by your childhood experience and that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s healthy and OP says \u201c I just saw it as the Lax youngest treatment\u201d meaning that he got the special treatment but saw it because he was youngest. \n\nIt really doesn't necessarily mean that. It may well have been the lax treatment youngest kids do tend to receive. There's not information here to conclude one way or the other, because there's no examples given.\n\n>All that is to say I don't think a difference in treatment is 100% full proof fact that the one getting better treatment is the golden child.\n\nThat's literally the only point I really made though. I'm not saying he isn't the golden child in his family. I'm saying that a difference in treatment without further information on what those differences are etc doesn't mean anything definitive either way.", "I\u2019m confused, OP says \u201cI (25M)\u201d so I made the corrections to reflect that now. But I don\u2019t think the sibling is a brother.", "The term \u201cgaslighting\u201d has been around since long before you were born. My guess is that you don\u2019t even know where it comes from (and yeah, I don\u2019t care if you Google it now because anyone can do that.)", "OMG, I thought I was the only one who used this acronym!", "has someone taken your faith? it\u2019s real, the pain you feel \ud83c\udfb6", "The child they don\u2019t see or look right through.", ">My little sibling was always fully aware that I was paving the way though. Unlike OP.\n\nMine wasn't. I don't fault her for it at all because no one told her and there wasn't really a way for her to know outside of that.", "I am only 4 years younger than my sister and I fully realize my mom was more lax on me than my sister. People tend to be overprotective of their eldest and once the other(s) come along, parents typically have a better grasp on what is too harsh. It\u2019s unfair to the eldest, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that uncommon.", "I get that in theory but, in my personal experience, I think it\u2019s very possible to experience somewhat different upbringings with a shorter age difference. My sister and I only have a 3.5 year difference but she always had more flexible rules on what she could watch, on her bedtime, on her study schedule. Yes, it might be more rare but it does happen. And I resented my sister for longer than I should\u2019ve because of it.\n\nNot that it changes anything else from this particular story, OP\u2019s still the AH.", "Was mad.\n\nNow she is mad at something OP did.", "Yeah gay men definitely don\u2019t exist this can\u2019t be real", "Reading comprehension is important", "This was my first thought on it. I suppose they could have waited till after too but then things could be awkward for them at the wedding. With the extra pressure of not wanting to upstage but probably having couple habits already that could easilly come out unintentionally during the wedding. Especially if drinking is involved. I think people assume the worst way too easily.", "I think for some, a pre wedding release is the only way. What is upsetting in the sisters honor is the relationship was extensive and established. A month before the wedding is wedding season- why not be loving and share your life with your family 3 months into the relationship when you understand it\u2019s depth vs ever letting it get close to wedding season.", "Agreed. I feel like op is being blamed for a situation his parents created. He hasn\u2019t done anything (according to the post) intentionally malicious. The parents loved him right away and that sucks for his sis but I feel she could\u2019ve approached this better. Why not \u201chey bro, you get along super well with the in laws, I\u2019m having a hard time connecting. Do you think that you could help me find a way to connect?\u201d Totally possible that this was the initial approach or that op\u2019s questioning was with malicious intent, I\u2019m just saying based off the post it seems like sis missed some steps and op is taking the heat for his parents\u2019 mistakes", "Ohh, that\u2019s actually a solid point. Interesting idea.", "But seriously, if OP had reacted to his sister with kindness and recovered the conversation I think it could have been fine.  If they had kept talking and apologized for not paying attention to her, for gloating.  Saying they didn't mean to gloat they were just happy.  Ask her about her first meeting with the family.  Ask her about the relationship.  How does Xmas work.  Show any kind of interest in sister any kind of caring.", "No it is usually some random person I am chatting with because I like to chat and I don't bring  needles to run errands. I have run into a few with shopping carts.", "Usually when a person reacts with such resentment and anger towards a person it usually means that they were the golden child. Opportunities can mean a lot of things such as going out with friends or having friends. OP could\u2019ve stole any attention away from the sister.", "OP's sibling is a brother, and he is dating her husband's younger brother.", "It\u2019s extremely common.", "\ud83e\udd23", "Yeah, how can he be gay and likable?!  /s", "sir,  we only read titles here on Reddit and not articles   or posts", "Sir, this is a Wendy's.", "Story says about a year", "It is selfish to rise above the fray when everyone around you is mistreating the same one other person, especially if that person is your immediate family.   \n\n\nCategories and labels aside, it sounds like in this instance, the sister needs her brother to be an ally much more than the other way around.", "Exactly - OP did not try to handle this well at all.\n\n\nlike, i'm autistic and I know how to handle this better than OP (even if I would be a bit stilted in the conversation)", ">I always thought my sister (27F) and I (25M) had a decently close relationship\n\nThis is literally the first sentence. OP\u2019s sibling is *his sister*.

Does she love her partner less now?  Is their relationship somehow not as important to them because of this?  How is her happiness being restricted?  This is absolutely crazy that people think a wedding day\u2026.a fucking wedding day\u2026.should determine when a couple announce their own happiness.  Once again this sub is reinforcing why it should not be sought out for any opinion or advice.  Y\u2019all would rather people suffer than be happy.", "It is because op presupposes their sister is being silly.", "Yes, I was clear on the gay male part - I thought when you said \"I don't think the sibling is a brother\" that you meant his sister's husband's sibling and fucked up the first part of my sentence, lol.

Even more to the point, it mirrored the dynamic from their own parents growing up, which he acknowledged he's aware of. Even still, instead of trying to sympathize with her or do anything to help her improve her relationship with the in-laws, his first thought is to tattle, making it worse for her and better for him.\n\nIf that ain't selfish, I don't know what is", "This.", "Ah I see, cheers mate.", "It's ok great minds etc etc", "So he expresses he thought about something and used better judgment and decided against but yet somehow that makes him an AH and inconsiderate?
