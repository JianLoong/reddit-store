It\u2019s life.", "Man, do you hear yourself? Are you capable of taking your sister seriously in any of her experiences? When you heard that she didn't get the same reception from the in-laws that you did, were you angry at them for her sake? Did you take her side? Or did you just automatically accept that their preference of you over her was an acceptable way for grownups to behave?  \n\n\nBecause if you're okay with your in-laws treating you and your sister differently, then you are a total AH.", "Dude you\u2019re so selfish I can definitely see why your sister views you as golden child. You definitely give those spoiled vibes.", "I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re being deliberately obtuse or not, but I\u2019ll answer in good faith: You\u2019re missing the point. \n\nYour sister doesn\u2019t view her in laws as objects. She\u2019s upset because you were automatically welcomed into their family and she was not. I think anyone would be upset by this, whether there were a golden child involved or not. The fact that there *is* a golden child involved only exacerbates the issue, however. \n\nThat being said, yes. YTA. Your announcement a month before her wedding is (at best) in poor taste or (at worst) intentionally malicious.", "Oh, you don't have to tell us that your focus is on yourself, that's abundantly clear.  And it's also abundantly clear you weren't thinking of your sister at all.  It's all you, you, you.", "Sounds like your first thought was how you could make the in-laws like you more.", "But by your sister's telling of it, they did NOT welcome her with open arms.\n\nYou can't tell her what her own lived experiences are.  You get that, right?  That people have different interactions with the same person?  That those interactions make each person feel one way or another and it might not match up?", ">I chose not to because it\u2019s her life and her relationships, not mine\n\nExactly.  In fact? I think that because you didn\u2019t actually talk to your in-laws about it, you would have been better off not even mentioning it in your post. \n\nLet the in-laws see and decide for themselves.", "This is the worst place you could have sought out opinions.  You are seeking life advice from people who have barely lived life.  \n\nTake it from a gay man with an older sister who held a lot of resentment towards him as well.  Be happy.  Life is short.  If your sister can\u2019t recognize the smaller chance you have as a gay man at finding another man to be happy with then she isn\u2019t an ally and she definitely isn\u2019t being a good sister.  \n\nGood luck man and all positive things to you.", "Ah yes, because being gay excuses being selfish", "It\u2019s not selfish to want to be happy.", "It is when that happiness is at the expense of someone else's happiness, by definition"]}
