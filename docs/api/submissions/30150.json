Told him what to say instead, had him repeat it back, good to go. Later he did the same thing, Tried the approach again. \n\nFew minutes, same thing again, so I said his name sharply and repeated the coaching again. A few minutes later, the fourth time. I finger wagged and told him that if he does it again, we\u2019re going home.

She then said it wasn\u2019t the consequence that set her off but the finger wag.\n\nWe talked about how a few nights ago when I was away for work, he was being unkind towards her and she took away cookies while FaceTiming me. I explained I didn\u2019t criticize her for doing it despite us not talking about the possibility of him being a jerk when eating cookies. I explained I trusted her judgement because:\n1.

Certainly not cutting off trick or treat altogether. It wasn't even an incorrect thing to say - he did want candy, he was there for candy, the entire point of trick or treating is to get candy. The *only* thing that actual would actually require correction is if he didn't say thank you at the end of the interaction- which you didn't cover.\n\nAlso, stating and then following through with punishment is *not* \"positive reinforcement\", and neither is \"removing the thing creating the bad behavior\". You're using that term incorrectly.

If you assess the Halloween thing, and the cookies thing against those values, then you\u2019ll probably find that they line up quite nicely. \n\nAnd it\u2019s worth getting more info on the gentle parenting thing - done right, it\u2019s not about being a doormat or giving them 76 chances to not be a brat before they get a consequence - more around assuming they are basically Nice People Who Are Struggling To Get It Right while you give them the consequence, instead of trying to squash them like a bug, in the manner of eg 1980s parenting style.
