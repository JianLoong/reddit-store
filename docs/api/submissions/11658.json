We have been together for ten years and I see them as my own family. There is nothing I don't do for these kids.\n\nIt all started about a month ago, we were clearing out our old bedroom because we were moving into a new house and the kids were over helping us clean. Nelly (F5) and Gary (M10) were playing in some of my old dress clothes from high school and wanted to keep some of the jewelry they found. I was perfectly okay with them keeping all of it until Nelly got to my bracelet. A bracelet that was given to me by my dad when my dad was still himself. My dad is a severe alcoholic and has not been the same since I was about 11. I cherish the bracelet and didn't want to give it away. \n\nIt started with some snarky comments from my boyfriend, then escalated into making me feel like shit for not \"giving it to a little girl\". I ended up being the bad guy in that situation, mainly because he escalated it so much that I became the bad guy in everyone else's eyes, and I ended up just walking away.\nA few days later, they were going through my old stuffed animals and Nelly started again with needing every single one she saw. \n\nNow, I am 28, but I still love all of my stuffed animals. I clenched my teeth and let her take quite a few of them, but my tiger was not going with her. I am specifically saving that for when I have children because it was my most loved stuffed animal as a kid. It has too much sentimental value to me to just end up in my niece's toy box, untouched and thrown away.\n\nBut, again, my boyfriend started with the comments and made me feel like a total dickhead. Called me selfish, called me childish, told me I didn't know how to share. Mind you, saying this all in front of the kids as a way to guilt me into doing it. I stood firm again and said no.\nIt started a huge argument that night. I tried to tell him doing that in front of the kids was super manipulative and just wrong. It means something to me. I'm not giving it away. He didn't seem to care. He just went on about how I ruined a little girl's day. When I honestly don't even think she cared that much and just forgot about it as soon as she got home.\n\nHis point is that he wants her to feel like she can have anything from us if she asks for it, but I told him that's not a very realistic thing to be teaching a 5-year-old. You can't teach her that she can just have anything she wants at our house. That is not how things work. It's okay for her to ask, it's not okay for him to expect me to give her everything just because she wants it. \nTo make this clear, I don't blame the child for wanting things. That's what children do. I blame my boyfriend for demanding that I give her things and escalating every single situation to make me the bad guy. \n\nI don't know, am I being childish? Should I just let these things go or am I right to want to hold onto things that are important to me, even if they seem insignificant?", "created_utc": 1678129464, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11kaipu/aita_for_not_giving_my_niece_my_old_stuff/", "score": 185, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You even were letting go of some stuff, but others you said no, not this item. And it's perfectly ok to have stuff that means a lot, as long as you don't hoard every little thing.\n\nSurely your bf has a playstation or something like that.

Of course they want to keep toys from their friends\u2019 houses, but I explain to them that those toys don\u2019t belong to us. We can play with them next time we come over.

The fact that he thinks you should put your feelings aside for his niece's is kind of weird.\nI wonder what has he given them from his things??? Like idk a special baseball ball from his fav team to his nephew? \nYou're absolutely right to stand your grounds. You should have the right to keep things you want. Maybe talk to the parents of your niece and nephew so theybcan also tell their children they're not to shop at your house.\n\nSorry english isn't my first language", "NTA. You have been very generous and have done a good job teaching Nelly that it's not reasonable to walk into ANY space and demand /expect to be given any item you set your eyes on. She should not expect that, AND she should feel it's ok to have boundaries with certain items that she cares deeply about as well. \n\nThis attitude from your BF is really odd and questionable....not only because it is impractical and really teaching her to be spoiled and demanding, but also because it involved belittling and 'ganging up on' you. He should have more respect for your decisions and positions on things - these are YOUR possessions and thus you have sole right to say yes or no when asked for them, and you would have been completely in your right to say 'no' across the board. You should have a frank discussion with your BF about this and demand that he put a stop to that treatment.", "100% NTA.\nIt is really mean of your bf to guilt you like that it is your stuff and you can do as you please with it.

Lets see how quickly your (hopefully soon to be ex) boyfriend changes his mind when you plant suggestions that the kids could have some of his treasured items.", "NTA - I do have a major issue with the way your bf handled this. You have to teach the child to respect other peoples things too... and that is what he failed at miserably. He also failed at realizing the importance of a few things. If he doesnt sentimental attachment to things... that is his issue... not yours. I would expect more from a partner of 10 years.", "NTA. it's your stuff. He's being extremely manipulative and just an asshole. The kid probably understood too. Plus your still giving her most of what she asks for", "NTA. It\u2019s clear you care for those children. It\u2019s ok if you cherish memories throughout some stuff. You have every right to keep toys for your future kids. \nYour boyfriend is TA because he can\u2019t understand what is important to you, that children should learn some lessons and that he can\u2019t mind trip you in front of them.", "NTA\n\nBf sucks. Special to you means special to both of you. He needs to respect what you view as special if he wants a future with you.", "NTA - I have a very very few cherished childhood items. I won't give them to just anyone.\n\nYour bf is an AH.

I would look long and hard at the BF and ask yourself if you really want to spend your life with someone who sees no problem in bullying and pressuring you. \n\nKeep your treasures. Life is long and full of regrets. Don't let giving your things away be one of those regrets.", "op=NTA\n\nbut your boyfriend is.  I realize you have been with him for ten years, but now is the time to look at how else he treats you--and his attitude that a child shouldn't be told no--if you are looking to have children in the future--is that the message you want your child taught?\n\nYou absolutely have every right to keep your belongings ALL of them.  If he wants to share so much--he can SHARE his stuff.\n\nPS put your precious memories somewhere safe--I've seen too much(here on reddit and elsewhere) where people give away OTHER people's stuff with impunity.", "NTA why are you with someone who treats you like shit?", "Please add NTA to your comment.\n\nAnd, yes, OP, you should NOT be living with this man. Your property will never be safe. Loving partners don't talk to their partners the way he talks to you.", "THANK YOU!!!", ">Definitely THIS", "I just cannot imagine someone who cares at all about another person behaving this way towards them.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

NTA", "NTA but your boyfriend sure as hell is. Mocking you and calling you names? Not ok. Doing so in front of others? Not ok. \n\nYour things are your things, And you are entitled to do with them as you see fit. Whether that means keeping them or giving them away, those choices are entirely yours because they are your possessions.", "NTA, but please save yourself a lot of grief, pack up the stuff that is particularly precious to you and get it out of the house in a safe place, and then break up with this guy.    \n            \nIf this is how he treats you after ten years, the LAST thing you need is to be the mother of his child. Please, please, please, do not do this to yourself.       \n         \nHe has shown you who he is. Believe him.", "What is his most cherished items? His most expensive watch? Entice the nephew to want them. See what he says & does then.", "NTA But why on earth are you with a guy that treats you like that? Like seriously dude wants you to give up anything and everything to his family ?", "NTA. Your bf is a massive AH though. He may want to spoil his niece as much as he wants but that\u2019s irrelevant here. How he\u2019s treating you, berating you in front of the children, and as you rightly pointed out, being horribly manipulative while having no empathy for you, his 10 years long partner should be a deal breaker. He also has no rights to demand you give away your things and making you feel guilty about it. Trust your instincts and yourself. We all have rights to hold onto things that have emotional values to us without being made to feel guilty about them. You are not being childish. He is. Don\u2019t let him gaslight you.", "NTA your boyfriend has no right to give away your stuff. You were perfectly entitled to say \u201cnope that one is special to me and I am keeping it, but you can have these instead\u201c and it is not the end of the world for a five year old to be told no. In fact, quite the opposite. He made it much more difficult than it needed to be, and didn\u2019t respect your boundaries or belongings.\nI would think long and hard about your future with him, especially if you are ever considering having children in the future. I fear he would repeat that pattern over and over, indulging them because it\u2019s easier, and making you the bad guy.\nAlso, maybe don\u2019t involve these children when you are cleaning out your childhood items. Instead to see through on your own and then bring them a box of stuff you no longer want.", "Absolutely not. If he wants to give her that stuffed animal, he can go look for it and get it for her if she wants it that bad. But it sounds like kids being kids and just wanting each pretty thing they see. They have no sentimental value, truthfully, it sounds like they\u2019re kinda testing your boundaries to see what you\u2019ll say yes to", "NTA. You need to think ahead to when she wants your TV, couch or even your car.  You need to teach her boundaries. You BF is an A though. He's completely disrespecting your property, and doing it in front of a kid to pressure you.", "Yeah, OP, there is NO way this guy suddenly got struck on the head and started treating you like garbage. This guy is not a good guy. I would pack all of your stuff up yourself and run for the hills.\n\nOR you could offer one of the kids something that is important to your BF, like his computer or Xbox, and then treat him like absolute garbage for denying the kids something. However, I'd just leave.", "This is what I was going to say.", "This. OP he doesn't respect you. At all. Take these red flags and run. There are people out there who will put your feelings above the material wants of a five year old."]}
