Two days ago, my friends went partying near my workplace and asked me if I could drive them home (4 girls, all 21-23 years olds) when I'm done at work.\n\nI agreed, but only under a conditions, they can't be very drunk. There was once an accident where one of my friends vomited in my car after a New Years party, and I don't want this to happen again. Of course I won't tell them to not drink at all at a party, but if they want my ride completely free, they should be moderate with alcohol.\n\nWhen I arrived, two of then were completely drunk, not at all what we agreed to. I told the two other girls that I would give them a ride home, but not the drunk girls. They could barely even stand at this point, but they could still kinda talk understandingly. I offered to call them an uber, and pay for it, since I know how dangerous it is to walk alone at this time. They refused, saying how the uber was unsafe and they could get kidnapped in this state. I tried to convince them, but they said I promised them a ride. I reminded them of the rule, then one of them said \"she wasn't even that drunk\", which was an obvious lie.\n\nMy best friend was one of the sober girls, and she said I could really make an exception this time. I told her no, my condition was obvious, but the girls were actually barely standing on their feet, and they had a strong smell of alcohol on them.\n\nAfter all, my bestfriend agreed to ride the uber with the two of them, and we split the costs of it, and I brought the remaining one home alone,  and she complained how rude I was to force them to pay etc. After some talking, she seemed to understand my part too, and said that one of them already puked in the toilets, so I was understandable, but could've handled the situation better. \n\nThe other day, my bestfriend called me to tell me how I was unfair & didn't stick to my promise and she won't count on me again. I tried to explain myself again, but she didn't understand, and hung up on me. \n\nAITA for not taking all of them home after setting a rule?", "created_utc": 1690370445, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15a305l/aita_for_only_driving_home_my_sober_friends/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Lol, yea, you didn\u2019t pry open the mouths of the,  (drunk to the point of vomiting),  girls and pour the booze down their throats. They did that on their own, before you even got to the party.  And they all still got home safe. \n\nYou even offered to pay for their uber.

No not an asshole but a sucker for paying for grown ass people who decided to disregard your one rule and then play the victim", "NTA. You even tried to get them safely into an Uber. What more you supposed to do? Your offer was conditional, all they had to do was not try to take advantage of you.", "NTA, but I find the condition of the ride to be really odd because usually that's the reason I DO pick my friends up.", "NTA but silly for paying for the uber. You didn't owe them anything", "NTA. You had one rule, they couldn't obey it. I've seen a few comments say you could've helped out this one time... Well, you break your rule one time and then they do it again. You say no the second time and then this same issue happens. You've gotten it all out of the way :) it sounds like you've dodged a bullet because they won't call you for a lift home when they're sloppy drunk.", "NTA.", "NTA- You are not a personal Uber service. I would  not even call an Uber on my personal Uber account.  If they get sick in the Uber, you are responsible for damages. I wonder if the females drank to excessiveness because they had a free ride home. I would have a hard rule, no rides home period.

Not because of the rules they broke (which they did, and you were right to be upset) but for not understanding how dangerous it is for a drunk woman to get an uber. Two drunk 22 year old girls that are too drunk for your precious car are easy prey. To me, YTA because you put your car above their lives and safety. They clearly trusted you a lot (and maybe that\u2019s why they lost control a little bit) and you showed them they shouldn\u2019t have.", "NTA - You set ground rules and they should respect those! You tried to offer an alternative solution, to make sure they were safe too. It can be distracting to have incredibly drunk people as passengers, especially after finishing a shift at work and already being tired from that.", "YTA. Honestly, I think you were being a little naive and should have simply said no in the first place.", "Yta I get it happened before but it would\u2019ve been nice of you to just help out your friends in this situation.

Look back and how often are you expected to give them a lift versus how often you are included in their activities.\n\nFrom the information provided it looks like they are taking advantage of you big time.
