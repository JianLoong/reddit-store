Two days ago, my friends went partying near my workplace and asked me if I could drive them home (4 girls, all 21-23 years olds) when I'm done at work.\n\nI agreed, but only under a conditions, they can't be very drunk. There was once an accident where one of my friends vomited in my car after a New Years party, and I don't want this to happen again. Of course I won't tell them to not drink at all at a party, but if they want my ride completely free, they should be moderate with alcohol.\n\nWhen I arrived, two of then were completely drunk, not at all what we agreed to. I told the two other girls that I would give them a ride home, but not the drunk girls. They could barely even stand at this point, but they could still kinda talk understandingly. I offered to call them an uber, and pay for it, since I know how dangerous it is to walk alone at this time. They refused, saying how the uber was unsafe and they could get kidnapped in this state. I tried to convince them, but they said I promised them a ride. I reminded them of the rule, then one of them said \"she wasn't even that drunk\", which was an obvious lie.\n\nMy best friend was one of the sober girls, and she said I could really make an exception this time. I told her no, my condition was obvious, but the girls were actually barely standing on their feet, and they had a strong smell of alcohol on them.\n\nAfter all, my bestfriend agreed to ride the uber with the two of them, and we split the costs of it, and I brought the remaining one home alone,  and she complained how rude I was to force them to pay etc. After some talking, she seemed to understand my part too, and said that one of them already puked in the toilets, so I was understandable, but could've handled the situation better. \n\nThe other day, my bestfriend called me to tell me how I was unfair & didn't stick to my promise and she won't count on me again.

You don't have to be more flexible at all, but your friends will probably see it differently and I don't necessarily think that's wrong either; you were willing to leave the most vulnerable of the group - whilst you did make sure they had a way home and could afford it, that's likely the factor here souring their attitudes to you. \n\nI would've voted 'NAH' but ultimately it's your car, your favour and your rules that two of them disregarded.

They could get in an uber but not your car? Also you as the sober person are now exerting that sober position of power over these inebriated women who thought they had a way home with you and you took that away. So I guess congrats for that? \n\nSure you stuck up for a \"boundary\" and everyone here will love that, but this is a conflict that you pretty much engineered yourself for what kinda seems like so you could get revenge or \"make a point\" about the throw up incident from new years, which is likely why your friend is so pissed so........yea ESH.", "\"she complained how rude I was to force them to pay \"\n\nSo it's not rude of them to demand a free ride after you get off work?  So you have a job and then it's your second job to give them rides?  That sounds like it sucks.\n\nYou told them the rules which had reasons because of THEIR actions, and they tossed them aside.  Your \"Best friend\" asking to you make an exception is laughable because every time will be an exception.\n\nYour \"Best Friend\" is a piece of work saying you didn't stick to your \"promise\" when they didn't stick to the rules that you told them beforehand.  She won't count on you?  Nice!  Problem solved!  But what she has a hard time wrapping her head around is that it goes both ways.  You didn't forget about your promise, THEY forgot about the rules.  They were drunk and had admitted they had already been vomiting.  So they forgot about the rules of the ride the second they got to the bar.\n\nYour \"best friend\" is a pathetic drunk hypocrite that will always spotlight the facts that benefit her.  Honestly you just need better friends as it seems these friends don't really value you beyond how they can use you.  As I said, her hanging up on you was a gift.

One of them had already vomited in your car in the past and you were obviously just trying to avoid a repeat of that night. The smell of vomit definitely lingers, even after it feels like you've scrubbed every inch of your car. Most people would have respected their friend's request and drank more responsibly. But this group didn't, and got mad at you when you were laying down consequences for their actions. \n\nI really want to hammer home that respect is an integral part of friendship. If your friend makes a perfectly reasonable request of you, such as \"don't get so drunk you'll soil yourself in my car\", you just do it.

He shot straight up and straight out the door into the lawn, dick flapping, yelling at whoever set it off. Convinced him that catching a charge might affect his custody and finally he\u2019s in the car & we can leave. Blanket wrapped around. Still only wearing socks  when he starts puking out the window on the highway leaning out further and further. Except there\u2019s nothing for me to grab onto besides some butt hair.
