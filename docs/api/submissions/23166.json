Two days ago, my friends went partying near my workplace and asked me if I could drive them home (4 girls, all 21-23 years olds) when I'm done at work.\n\nI agreed, but only under a conditions, they can't be very drunk. There was once an accident where one of my friends vomited in my car after a New Years party, and I don't want this to happen again. Of course I won't tell them to not drink at all at a party, but if they want my ride completely free, they should be moderate with alcohol.\n\nWhen I arrived, two of then were completely drunk, not at all what we agreed to. I told the two other girls that I would give them a ride home, but not the drunk girls. They could barely even stand at this point, but they could still kinda talk understandingly. I offered to call them an uber, and pay for it, since I know how dangerous it is to walk alone at this time. They refused, saying how the uber was unsafe and they could get kidnapped in this state. I tried to convince them, but they said I promised them a ride. I reminded them of the rule, then one of them said \"she wasn't even that drunk\", which was an obvious lie.\n\nMy best friend was one of the sober girls, and she said I could really make an exception this time. I told her no, my condition was obvious, but the girls were actually barely standing on their feet, and they had a strong smell of alcohol on them.\n\nAfter all, my bestfriend agreed to ride the uber with the two of them, and we split the costs of it, and I brought the remaining one home alone,  and she complained how rude I was to force them to pay etc. After some talking, she seemed to understand my part too, and said that one of them already puked in the toilets, so I was understandable, but could've handled the situation better. \n\nThe other day, my bestfriend called me to tell me how I was unfair & didn't stick to my promise and she won't count on me again.

You don't have to be more flexible at all, but your friends will probably see it differently and I don't necessarily think that's wrong either; you were willing to leave the most vulnerable of the group - whilst you did make sure they had a way home and could afford it, that's likely the factor here souring their attitudes to you. \n\nI would've voted 'NAH' but ultimately it's your car, your favour and your rules that two of them disregarded.
