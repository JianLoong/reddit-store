Things between us have been difficult because our lives have turned out differently from each other. One big problem between us is how much I can hang out with her. I'm married and I have two daughters (twins) who are 10 months old. On the other hand, my friend is child-free and wants to remain child-free for the rest of her life. Because I have my own family and a job, and I'm just really busy I haven't had much time for her and she's been sore about it. Anyways, yesterday she called me asking if we could go out (today) and I told her I couldn't because I have the girls today because their dad is on a business trip. She told me that I could call a babysitter but both I and my husband aren't comfortable with that until our girls can talk. I told her that this wasn't the best time to ask to hang out. She got upset and said that I never have time to do anything with her and it's not fair that I can make time for my other friends and not her. \n\nThis is true but my other friends 100% allow me to bring my kids because they love kids and my friend doesn't. I told her that and she told me that it's her right if she doesn't want crying kids near her all the time I told her that's correct but then she shouldn't be upset when I can't see her and maybe she should find other childfree friends so she isn't consistently bothering me and putting me under pressure to find ways to see her that fit her schedule (she has never asked me when I was free or when my husband is home so he can be with the kids). She once again got upset and called me a selfish b*tch for not making time for her and she shouldn't have to find new friends because her friend couldn't keep her l*gs close. I ended up hanging up but since our conversation, I've been getting texts from her friends saying that I should consider her feelings because I got married as soon as I got out of high school so I never have time for her.

Friends don't treat friends the way she treats you.  And setting her friends on you to criticize your life -- that's truly terrible.\n\nThe person who should be finding different friends is you, not her.  You deserve to be with people who appreciate you and who don't disapprove of your life or your decision to marry and have children.  People who celebrate you and support you.\n\nMaybe say, \"You're right.  I don't have time for you.  I only have time for people who respect me.\"\n\nNTA", "NTA. Sounds like your friend shouldn\u2019t be your friend anymore. Unfortunately, new parents often lose friends all the time who aren\u2019t willing to grow with them and their family. The legs closed comment was totally uncalled for and ridiculous and would indicate the end of the relationship if it were me. You have young kids, not only that but TWINS!! I\u2019m sure you\u2019re very busy and a real friend would be understanding. I\u2019m sorry, OP, it sucks to see people\u2019s true colors when kids are born but it sounds like you have some other friends that are supportive and should spend more time with them instead!", "NTA \n\nShe's def the AH! Especially saying that part about keeping their legs closed? That was so insulting, gross and rude af. \n\nBlock her for now.", "NTA. I have childfree friends and I make time for them without my kids when my husband is home or when they\u2019re with grandparents \u2014 this person is not your friend.\n\nEDIT: I am a mom who **needs** no-kid time with my friends for my own social and mental well-being. All my childfree friends understand that making time to hang is tricky at times.", "NTA. I have made the life choices of your friend rather than yourself, but you're absolutely right.\n\nWhat kind of person thinks someone should consistently put their friends above their young children? It's unhinged thinking, and completely in keeping with her behaviour as she escalated it.\n\nShe does need childfree friends. We just don't want her.", "Nta ditch the dead weight", "NTA. \n\nBut friends that don\u2019t respect that you have kids are friendships you may have to say goodbye to. \n\nI\u2019m glad you do have friends that love your babies.", "Wow... Wowowowow... Obviously NTA. You're 100% correct with your reasoning and after what she said I would break off the friendship for sure.", "NTA people and priorities change, can be children or very demanding job, moving, a new relationship whatever. You point it out, your friend doesn\u2019t want to hear it. It\u2019s on her.", "NTA. Friends don\u2019t make comments about the legs. You\u2019re the selfish one? She\u2019s the one demanding your time even when it\u2019s not convenient for you . She\u2019s bringing the drama by having others text you. You don\u2019t need this kind of friendship", "She sounds horrible, so NTA. This said you should find time to hang out with your friends without the kids. I hope you do sometimes!", "NTA", "Sooooo NTA - people grow up. Clearly she\u2019s still acting like a child and you have children. You\u2019re just at different points in life now. Maybe she\u2019ll have kids one day and figuring out. But like crying that she has to find new friends? Boohoo honey, life changes. She\u2019s in for a lot of surprises if she can\u2019t figure this one out.", "NTAH but you need some new friends! Holy crap! Someone should tell them you're a grown-up now and maybe they should think about growing up!", "NTA.  People's priorities change as we grow and reach new milestones.  I have friends who got married and had children, while I decided to be childfree.  I don't see or talk to them that as much as we used to, but when we do meet up we have the best time, because we respect each others lifestyles and change in priorities. \n\nYour friend will figure it out.", "The problem here is that neither of you respects the other's lifestyle decision.\n\nYou're married, you have kids and a job, so obviously you don't have so much time for your friends anymore. It's not a judgement on my part, it's just a fact that your friend needs to understand.\n\nBut you can't seem to want to understand that she wants to hang with her friend and have adult conversations/activities. If you bring your kids, that's not happening. You're going to take care of your kids and the conversation is going to be about those kids. \n\nAlso, you say she never asks you when you're available. Do you assume that because she doesn't have kids, she has a lot more free time than you ? That she should plan outings on your schedule and your schedule only because you have kids ? \n\nFor me, ESH. Childfree people and people with kids can be friends and stay friends. They just need to accept that the friendship is going to be different and work on it like any other relationship in their lives.\n\nIf this frienship was important to both of you, you'd find a way to get along better.", "How often do you hang out with her?", "NTA. And I am sorry to say she is not your friend anymore. You have kids and now you are a \"package I+kids\". If she does not respect your choice to have kids and doesn't want you as a \"package\", than it's time to let her go. Besides, she is rude and disrespecting, so you are not losing anything (she is nothing valuable now)", ">maybe she should find other childfree friends so she isn't consistently bothering me...She called me a selfish btch\n\nESH, Everybody Sucks Here.  \n\nFriendships fizzle out for a variety of reasons.  Both of you need to learn how to let go without being an asshole to someone you once cared about.", "ESH. Depending on the delivery you're not necessarily wrong for suggesting it however your post is giving off \"my time and my life are are more important because I have children.\" As others have asked, do you ever ask her when she's free and then try to plan around that or do you just expect her to do that for you?\nIt's not wrong for her to want adult time without your kids.\nIt's also really sad that your frame your friend trying to spend time with you as \"bothering you.\"", "ESH, but only for the comments made to each other.", "NTA: your friend is the one being selfish and self centred, and your friends are being ridiculous by asking you to enable her just because you settled down early. It makes NO SENSE! I recommend you cut this friend off because she doesn\u2019t seem like a good friend and she seems better suited to have friends that have no children any way. As for your other friends, if they thing that your being unfair and expect you to choose her and her lack of awareness for your choice to enter motherhood, then they can also be cut off. It seems like they don\u2019t respect your a parent and you have other priorities. If she was making plans in advanced and working around your parenting it would be different, but she\u2019s expecting you to neglect your children for her. That\u2019s a bad friend and her not wanting children isn\u2019t an excuse for her disregard. Cut her off because your really not loosing anything by loosing her and she seems unsafe to be even remotely close to your children", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She is immature and very self-centered and not considerate of others who have a different lifestyle. You did your part in trying to keep the friendship going, but she showed no effort in trying to make it work around your life but only wanted it when it was good for her. Cut your losses and stick to friends who either understand your family comes first so there will be fewer hangouts or friends that like kids or have kids.", "NTA she\u2019s no friend of yours.", "NTA. I\u2019m childfree, happily, by choice and am not fond of kids in general. I have friends who have kids and ones who don\u2019t. One of my closest friends right now has a young child. I know her son and family come first. I have zero issues when she gets busy or needs to change plans last minute for them. You friend is not being a friend. If she were, she\u2019d understand and try to find solutions to spend time with you that worked. Despite the fact I\u2019m not super into kids in general, I also don\u2019t mind hanging out with my friend and her kid either.", "NTA\n\nThis isn't about you not having time with her. This is about her being unwilling to recognize that your life circumstances have changed. She could still spend time with you if that's TRULY what's important to her . . . but you can't go backwards, and time together is going to look different.\n\nLook, I don't have kids (not by choice, but that's another story) and I'm more than twice your age. When I was your age, though, two of my best friends were single mums, and like you they couldn't just \"call a babysitter\". They didn't have the money for that, nor did they want to; they wanted to spend time with their children when they could, because the rest of the time they were working. And because I loved them, and I wanted to support them, if I wanted to see them, I asked them what would work for them! \n\nUsually that meant hanging at their place. I'd bring coffee and pastries - and sometimes a bag of groceries for them and the kids when they were struggling. I learned to appreciate how hard their lives were at a time when I was still really lucky to have few responsibilities . . . and it taught me a lot about being a good friend that I carried with me as I got older and had responsibilities of my own.\n\nYour friend doesn't actually need child-free friends. She could come see you and the kids. But she doesn't want to do that. She wants you to act like your life hasn't changed, to hand your kids off to someone and come play at being single with her. She wants to make it about herself. But you aren't interested in that because you've grown past it, and that doesn't make you an AH. Nor does suggesting that if she doesn't want to be friends with the person you are now . . . perhaps she needs to make some friends who can fulfill her current needs.", "Absolutely \ud83d\udcaf this. There is child free, and then there is jealous of your time spent parenting.  I had a friend like this, and it turns out she wanted to be my favorite person and the center of my world.

It would make sense to figure out a date when we are both free or have some free time.", ">Childfree people and people with kids can be friends and stay friends. \n\nYeah maybe, but it's super hard and Most friendships will suffer considerably because of it. There is No bigger burden for friendship than children. If one has them and the other hasn't them that is. Especially because most people don't care about kids unless they are their own.\n\nAnd there is also the fact that having children changes you considerably as a person, while your childfree friend basically stays the same.", "I try to do it at least once a month.", "I think that pretty much what OP told her. To find other friends have their lives are going different directions and at the moment she can\u2019t give her the friendship and time she wants.

When I have a day when I'm free then I will ask her if she's free and if she says she is then we will hang out if she isn't then I will try to find a day that caters to both of us.
