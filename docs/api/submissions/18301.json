Because I have my own family and a job, and I'm just really busy I haven't had much time for her and she's been sore about it. Anyways, yesterday she called me asking if we could go out (today) and I told her I couldn't because I have the girls today because their dad is on a business trip. She told me that I could call a babysitter but both I and my husband aren't comfortable with that until our girls can talk. I told her that this wasn't the best time to ask to hang out. She got upset and said that I never have time to do anything with her and it's not fair that I can make time for my other friends and not her. \n\nThis is true but my other friends 100% allow me to bring my kids because they love kids and my friend doesn't. I told her that and she told me that it's her right if she doesn't want crying kids near her all the time I told her that's correct but then she shouldn't be upset when I can't see her and maybe she should find other childfree friends so she isn't consistently bothering me and putting me under pressure to find ways to see her that fit her schedule (she has never asked me when I was free or when my husband is home so he can be with the kids). She once again got upset and called me a selfish b*tch for not making time for her and she shouldn't have to find new friends because her friend couldn't keep her l*gs close. I ended up hanging up but since our conversation, I've been getting texts from her friends saying that I should consider her feelings because I got married as soon as I got out of high school so I never have time for her.

I\u2019m sure you\u2019re very busy and a real friend would be understanding.

It makes NO SENSE! I recommend you cut this friend off because she doesn\u2019t seem like a good friend and she seems better suited to have friends that have no children any way. As for your other friends, if they thing that your being unfair and expect you to choose her and her lack of awareness for your choice to enter motherhood, then they can also be cut off. It seems like they don\u2019t respect your a parent and you have other priorities. If she was making plans in advanced and working around your parenting it would be different, but she\u2019s expecting you to neglect your children for her. That\u2019s a bad friend and her not wanting children isn\u2019t an excuse for her disregard.

When I was your age, though, two of my best friends were single mums, and like you they couldn't just \"call a babysitter\". They didn't have the money for that, nor did they want to; they wanted to spend time with their children when they could, because the rest of the time they were working.
