She is currently 9 months pregnant and could give birth anytime in the next couple of weeks. The only major fight we have had throughout her pregnancy happened a couple days ago, and it was about what we were going to name our kid.\r  \n\r  \n It all started when we found out the gender of the baby. We didn\u2019t do a gender reveal and decided to find out the gender at one of her checkups because we didn\u2019t want to spend time making two lists of names then have to get rid of one after. So after we found out we were having a boy we sat down together and made a list. Almost all of the names she suggested were normal, until the one that caused me to write this post. She suggested we name our son Mune. She told me the name was from this movie she watched when she was younger and that it always stuck with her. I told her the name was a little out there and he would get made fun of for it. She claimed he wouldn\u2019t and we started going back and forth trying to decide whether to add the name to the list or not. Eventually she agreed to keep the name off the list, we picked some that we liked, and I thought that was that.\r  \n\r  \n Later on in her pregnancy her mom decided to throw a baby shower as it was her first grandchild, and my wifes pregnancy was almost over and we hadnt celebrated once. It was fine for the most part until we started to open the gifts. Most of them were normal baby things like diapers and bottles, until we got to her moms gift. My wife opened the gift bag and pulled out a blue handmade blanket. It seemed normal enough at first until my wife unfolded it and low and behold there was the name Mune written on the blanket. When I saw it i was pissed but didn\u2019t want to cause a scene so i stayed quiet. After that reveal I had family members come up to me and ask me about the name and why i hadnt told them. I didnt know what to tell them as i didnt have a clue about this either and just had to embarrassingly tell my family that, which pissed me off even more.\r  \n\r  \n Once the event ended and me and my wife went home I started to question her about the name. She got defensive and told me that it was a good name and that i was overreacting about it. I brought up the earlier points and told her it was a stupid name for a kid and if she wanted to name something Mune so bad she could use the name for a dog. She got upset and called her mom to come get her. After she left she called me and told me she wouldn\u2019t be coming back for awhile. Everyone ive talked to about this has said im not the asshole, but now that my wife has been gone and ive been thinking about it I feel like I could have handled the situation better.

It's not really cool that she blindsided you with publicly announcing the name at the party. It's almost as if you had nothing to do at all with the baby!

Obviously if your boyfriend girlfriend and you're not together that's a whole other ball game but you're married. Yeah Mune, that kid's going to be crucified. Why your wife refusing to understand that, that kid is going to be teased and tortured for being so different. They're going to probably be called puny Mooney or something like that.

Good luck.", "Nta, I have a somewhat unique name and I\u2019ve had to deal with being teased as a kid to literally no one getting it right when they first meet me. DO NOT let your wife do that to your son. She\u2019s naming a human being that will have to live with that name for 70-90 years.", "I think ESH. From the way you have written your post, it sounds like you have been pretty insulting towards your wife with a name she really likes. She is probably very disappointed you don\u2019t like it the way she does. Saying she should name a dog the name she has dreamed about naming her son, was not the way to go my dude.\n\nShe should also not be unilaterally deciding on the name and telling people behind your back.\n\nI would give a word of caution, especially since your wife has gone to stay with her mom . Where I live (Canada) a woman could totally block you from the hospital when she gives birth. The birth registration is done before mom and baby leave the hospital. By that point, baby is named, and requires both parents agreement to change it. It\u2019s one of the very few times when a woman has total control. Considering all of the ways women get the short end of the stick in society, it\u2019s a small imbalance toward men that I can\u2019t be completely unhappy about.\n\nI think you need to change tactics. Probably buy your wife some chocolates or something and calmly apologize for insulting the name she likes. You need to calmly explain that you are both in this together and that you both need to be invested in the name for your son. I think if you approach this with kindness, your wife is going to reciprocate and be sorry as well.  You didn\u2019t mention that this is a common issue of hers, so I\u2019m going to assume her emotions are just running high right now.

She is currently 9 months pregnant and could give birth anytime in the next couple of weeks. The only major fight we have had throughout her pregnancy happened a couple days ago, and it was about what we were going to name our kid.\r  \n\r  \n It all started when we found out the gender of the baby. We didn\u2019t do a gender reveal and decided to find out the gender at one of her checkups because we didn\u2019t want to spend time making two lists of names then have to get rid of one after. So after we found out we were having a boy we sat down together and made a list. Almost all of the names she suggested were normal, until the one that caused me to write this post. She suggested we name our son Mune. She told me the name was from this movie she watched when she was younger and that it always stuck with her. I told her the name was a little out there and he would get made fun of for it. She claimed he wouldn\u2019t and we started going back and forth trying to decide whether to add the name to the list or not. Eventually she agreed to keep the name off the list, we picked some that we liked, and I thought that was that.\r  \n\r  \n Later on in her pregnancy her mom decided to throw a baby shower as it was her first grandchild, and my wifes pregnancy was almost over and we hadnt celebrated once. It was fine for the most part until we started to open the gifts. Most of them were normal baby things like diapers and bottles, until we got to her moms gift. My wife opened the gift bag and pulled out a blue handmade blanket. It seemed normal enough at first until my wife unfolded it and low and behold there was the name Mune written on the blanket. When I saw it i was pissed but didn\u2019t want to cause a scene so i stayed quiet. After that reveal I had family members come up to me and ask me about the name and why i hadnt told them. I didnt know what to tell them as i didnt have a clue about this either and just had to embarrassingly tell my family that, which pissed me off even more.\r  \n\r  \n Once the event ended and me and my wife went home I started to question her about the name. She got defensive and told me that it was a good name and that i was overreacting about it. I brought up the earlier points and told her it was a stupid name for a kid and if she wanted to name something Mune so bad she could use the name for a dog. She got upset and called her mom to come get her. After she left she called me and told me she wouldn\u2019t be coming back for awhile. Everyone ive talked to about this has said im not the asshole, but now that my wife has been gone and ive been thinking about it I feel like I could have handled the situation better.

Not on the judgement though\u2026NTA. \n\nI kind of, sort of like the name. It\u2019s certainly different than a lot of basic names you hear. That being said, I do also understand how people may take the name and so I wouldn\u2019t want to name a kid of mine that either. \n\nI don\u2019t think it is highly likely that he would be teased for it, as it isn\u2019t bad enough sounding, but someone else (and probably multiple people) in the comments bring up a very valid point. The name would probably be spelled \u201cMoon\u201d. And not just that. No one will associate that name with some movie. They will 100% think that you named your kid after the moon, but that you all did not know how to spell it properly. Thus, ya\u2019ll are more likely to be looked down on for the name than the kid is lol. \n\nAlso, your recommendation was golden. If I ever get a dog, Mune sounds like a great name no cap.", "you are saving the child from a lifetime of hassles and abuse.  How do you pronounce it ?

While it's understandable that you were taken aback and frustrated when the name Mune appeared on the blanket, it's essential to approach such discussions with sensitivity during your wife's pregnancy. Let's break down the situation:Name disagreement: You and your wife disagreed about the name Mune for your son. This is a common issue that many couples face when deciding on a name for their child. It's essential to have open and respectful communication when discussing such matters.The surprise at the baby shower: The surprise appearance of the name on the blanket caught you off guard, and it's natural that you felt upset about it. However, it's possible that your wife didn't anticipate her mother's gift, and she might have felt pressured or conflicted by her mother's actions.Emotional response: It's crucial to understand that emotions run high during pregnancy, and it's a vulnerable time for both partners. It's easy for misunderstandings and conflicts to escalate.Communication: It's important to communicate openly with your spouse about your concerns and feelings. Name choices are deeply personal, and it's essential to find a compromise that both of you can be happy with.The way you handled it: Your response to the situation might have been overly critical and dismissive of your wife's feelings. Suggesting she use the name for a dog, for example, could be hurtful. It's essential to communicate your concerns without belittling her choices.In hindsight, it's clear that the situation could have been handled better. You may not be the sole \"asshole\" in this situation, but it's also not entirely your wife's fault. It's a challenging moment, and both of you should work on improving your communication and understanding each other's perspectives, especially as you prepare for the arrival of your child. You can try to have a calm and empathetic conversation with your wife to resolve this issue and find a name that you both agree on.\n\n\\---\n\n\\> Why is going behind my back telling her mom the chosen name and leaving me out of the decision, not a problem?Going behind your back to tell her mom the chosen name and excluding you from the decision-making process is indeed problematic and a breach of trust in your relationship. This behavior is not conducive to a healthy and open partnership, especially when it comes to significant decisions such as naming your child.Your concerns about this issue are valid, and it's essential to communicate these concerns with your wife. Trust and open communication are vital in any relationship, and addressing the issue of her sharing the name without your involvement is necessary to prevent further misunderstandings and conflicts.It's important to have an honest and respectful conversation with your wife about how this made you feel and the importance of making joint decisions together, especially regarding your child's name. Try to find a resolution that respects both of your feelings and opinions on the matter and strengthens your partnership as you prepare for the arrival of your child.", "NTA, names are a two yes situation.", "NTA.  Well,  Y T A for saying it was stupid.  At least, you are not diplomatic to a hormonal woman who weirdly wants this name very badly. \n\nBut otherwise, this is on her.

There are consequences and repercussions to choosing a name that is very unusual to begin with.... To go behind the other parent's back and tell a grandparent what the name is going to be, that is unacceptable.\n\nMy parents had decided on my older sibling's name. My father was pushing for a variation that changes one letter but the entire pronunciation (think Jenna vs Jenno). My mother was adamant, they both agreed it would be the original option (Jenna equivalent). My mother gave birth. My father filled in the birth certificate paperwork. My mother received the birth certificate with the Jenno equivalent. She was livid. The name was changed back. She was still livid when she told me this story about 17 years later. It made her question her trust in her partner and co-parent.\n\nThat's the root of the issue, here, OP. You two need to be able to trust each other and this is a big step in the wrong direction for your partner to be taking. My father learned his lesson and my parents remained married for 47 years (until my mother's death). You can get past this but it should definitely get discussed and clarified and put behind you before baby arrives. \n\nAs stated above, baby names mean two yeses = yes. One no = no.
