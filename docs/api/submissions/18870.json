I have a 19 year old who still lives under my roof- rent free, I'll let her stay as long as she needs. When family comes to visit us, as the guests- they get the couch or a mattress on the floor.

Kinda feel bad hijacking space in this post, but\u2026\n\nYou are correct, I openly refer to my daughters as adulting.

They work summer jobs for some additional/discretionary spending cash, or to save for the future. (My elder is saving for post grad and in a gap year, so a one year job.)

Saying the eighteen year old who joined the Marines and is serving overseas isn\u2019t an adult is silly. They are.
