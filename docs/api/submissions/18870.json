Sure it can be done but it's not as easy as it used to be. Why should she put herself into hardship when her mum is offering for her to live there? If mum is going to hold it over her head then she shouldn't have offered. I understand the whole \"mum's house, mums rules\" concept. But to me that means \"clean up after yourself\" and \"lights out after 11\" or stuff like that. Does that mean mum gets to walk in her room and read her diary? According to you it does. \"My house I can do what I want\" right? No it doesn't. There is something called boundaries and how about plain old respect? I'd never do that to my child. I have a 19 year old who still lives under my roof- rent free, I'll let her stay as long as she needs. When family comes to visit us, as the guests- they get the couch or a mattress on the floor.

Why isn\u2019t the 23 year old pulling weight as an adult in the household? Why is it up to mom to insist they do?* Adults don\u2019t need to be told to, they carry their own weight, because they are adults who care for themselves.\n\nAnd my statement stands. **if you aren\u2019t even paying your parents rent and are 23, you are not acting as an adult.** That isn\u2019t a bad/negative thing, but it absolutely does come with the strings of not yet being an adult.\n\nAs for the entire, ENTIRE, rest of your post - except the red herring of the diary - read it back to yourself.

I\u2019m grateful that she lets me live here and I do things around the house to compensate for the lack of rent.

She works like a responsible adult would, and offers to pay and the mother hasn't accepted. You say your adult children live with you rent free, debt free and with bachelors degrees. Yet according to your comment you must not consider them adults either if they are in your home. She is accepting that her mother is allowing her to live there and choosing to do so- like most kids her age in this day and age would do.

Happy wife, happy life? Hah!) for the comfort of guests we had. =)", "I am enjoying this conversation! Kinda feel bad hijacking space in this post, but\u2026\n\nYou are correct, I openly refer to my daughters as adulting. They walk around with my credit card in their pocket, live in my house or housing I pay for at college, driving cars titled to me that I bought and insure, texting on phones I pay the plan for. They work summer jobs for some additional/discretionary spending cash, or to save for the future. (My elder is saving for post grad and in a gap year, so a one year job.) They are not yet adults.\n\nAge means nothing. Taking responsibility for your own well being does. Saying the eighteen year old who joined the Marines and is serving overseas isn\u2019t an adult is silly. They are. Similarly, saying the 25 year old who lives rent free and responsibility free (as in, being completely responsible for your own well being and care) at home with mom and dad is an adult is also silly.

But to me, if mom needed the space for family in her home for the visit, her kids need to follow the game plan - and that includes this kid. I respect the heck out of you making a different choice. I just respect it is a choice you get to make, and making another choice (kids get the couch to offer some comfort and a little privacy for an adult couple as guests) is something I also respect.", "I work 5-6times a week, live 40-50 minutes from my job, I\u2019m juggling a lot more than an 8 year old.
