You didn\u2019t force anything on her, only answered questions. W OP", "NTA\n\nYou had an open conversation she initiated. It\u2019s not like you held her down against her will. 16 is plenty old enough to understand the conversation you had.\n\nUnfortunately unless your sister will back you up, you may have to apologize to save face. But I\u2019d talk with your mom first to see if he really means what he says that\u2019s it\u2019s both of them (wrongly) upset", "NTA. 16 is old enough to understand. 16yo Muslim girls wear headscarves because they are old enough to understand the rationale of wearing a head covering. The only thing I would avoid is her wearing one as just a fun accessory; since they are religious garments, they should be treated as such.", "NTA. She is just curious about her sister's appearance and wants to try it out. A head scarf is not a magic conversion hat that makes her a Muslim after wearing it once.", "NTA\n\nShe's old enough to understand other religions and make her own decisions on what she thinks about them. \n\nYou shared something with her and had a bonding moment.\n\nYou did no converting. You simply shared information.\n\nYour dad is TAH here.", "NTA. I find it so confusing when people are so terrified and hateful about the smallest of things, by applying illogical and over the top meanings to them. A headscarf is just a scarf. When a Muslim wears it with a specific intention, then it holds meaning but not without that intention. If your sister- who wasn\u2019t forced- just wanted to try it out, it doesn\u2019t make her a Muslim.\n\nWhy equate a physical object to a whole religion; why jump to that extreme? This is with other examples such as certain cosmetics/clothing/jewellery affecting someone\u2019s masculinity. The dad seems very fragile in his thinking and super narrow-minded. Gosh, I think you need to talk to your mum and have your sister back you up\u2026.", "NTA. She's old enough to have such discussions, and you were just exchanging information, not trying to convert each other. Wearing a headscarf is not necessarily a religious thing; it could be cultural or a fashion statement. It's good that she knows how to properly wear one, in case she is in a situation where she needs to. For example, when I visited the mosque in Abu Dhabi as a tourist, I had to put on a headscarf, and I was glad I knew how to do it properly. It had nothing to do with my beliefs; it was just the dress code for the location.", "NTA\n\nIf a child is old enough to ask a question, they're old enough for an answer.", "NTA - She's old enough to understand and is the one who brought it up.  That said, now that you know their boundary you could easily agree not to have this discussion with her again while she lives in their home.", "NTA\n\n16 isn\u2019t too young to understand. No age would be too young to understand.\n\nYou had a healthy, respectful discussion about religion and you honoured her request to try something on.\n\nStep-dad is telling on himself and his views on your religion here.", "Nta but your stepdad is", "...

Lol", "Nta. The headscarf is not a religious item", "Really? Because I asked my grandad what anal sex is when I was 4 years old. (I learned to read very early and I was reading anything I could get my hands on - including discarded newspapers).", "Islam, just like any other contemporary religion, has different worship styles within the broader faith. The same way you cannot conflate a Jehova's Witness with a mainstream Christian despite both being Christian derivative faiths, you cannot assume that someone who converted to Islam is a member of a portion of that faith which you yourself would personally define as misogynistic. Faith is as inherently personal as opinions are, and the way one person worships may not be the way you assume the religion works at all.", "While of course Islam has been used to promote and enforce misogyny (Like most religions) that isn't all their is to it. I'm also probably not considered the most devout Muslim by most standards.", "Don\u2019t think we\u2019d expect you to know, user food-truck-fuck", "Why would a woman convert to any stupid religion?", "You were old enough for **an** answer. Your family got to decide what that answer would be.\n\nWhen my kid asked how babies are made, I somehow got him curious about the cell division part. It\u2019s all in how you frame it.", "I can only judge based on what I see and hear. It only takes five seconds to get thousands of search results explaining how the religion actively restricts women's rights.\n\nI'll give you credit though, you're the first person to respond who wasn't just losing their shit and providing no context.", "Fucking forget it, you didn't even answer my question.\n\nFor fucks sake.\n\nYTA", "I'm asking a genuine question, if you can't answer don't respond asshole.", "The religion *as it is practiced and discussed in those particular sources* is likely practiced in a way that, yes, the article argues is misogynistic. If I Google \"is Islam misogynistic?\" I will get articles both saying yes and no, all with different examples. Ask a broad question, get a broad set of answers.\n\nThere are incredibly misogynistic versions of Catholicism and Christianity, too. Not every religion is automatically one way or another because certain people practice it in ways you or I disagree with.  \n\n\nI have generally unfavourable opinions of religion, personally, but my opinion on OP's religion is not what is being asked. They want to know if they were an asshole for letting their step sister ask questions, answering them in (I assume) good faith, and letting her wear a headscarf just for funsies.", "If it was a genuine question, then it wouldn\u2019t be pre-loaded with your preconceived notions of Islam as a whole being misogynistic.\n\nYou could have asked, \u201coh I thought that Islam was widely misogynistic, how would a women find such a deep connection to the religion to want to convert(feel free to correct me on my biases)\u201d\n\nBut instead you came straight outta gate with a blanket statement about Islam? That\u2019s not a question that was a judgement.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know how to \u201cask\u201d a genuine question, then don\u2019t \u201cask\u201d asshat. There are many accounts of people finding something in Islam online, go\nGoogle", "Fine line between genuine questions and being ignorant and offensive. If you can\u2019t phrase a question without coming across like an asshole, then I guess it\u2019s time to learn some social etiquette.\n\nYet we all knew you weren\u2019t asking a question but making a very thinly veiled attempt to insult a whole religion with your presumptuous and xenophobic thinking. You seem very judgemental: how about live and let live?", "You aren't even the OP. I'm not gonna tolerate this kind aggression from someone I wasn't even talking to.", "NTA, seems pretty much the same as a sibling asking to try on any other accessory or clothing item. Plenty of sisters end up teaching each other how to, say, walk in heels. It's fun to experiment with, and since she approached you with the religion questions... I mean if you refused she does still have access to google", "It\u2019s his kid his choice keep your religion to yourself. It\u2019s not ok for anyone to expose someone else\u2019s kid to there beliefs without permission. Won\u2019t call you an AH tho maybe naive is what I will say", "Muslim woman here, even if she/any female wanted to wear a headscarf as an accessory once in a while or all the time, let her/them. obviously not if they were doing it to mock, but if they think they look nice in it or they are comfortable in it or its hella cold and want to warm their ears, let them.", "Well I would debate that point. Many women who cover their hair take pride in the fact that they are separated visually from \"the norm\" I think if you say it's not a religious item that is taking that away from people who are visually religious. As well as it coming across like a white person saying \"I don't see color\" that doesn't mean color doesn't exist you know?", "When I grew up most of the grannys wore headscarves. In Germany. Definitely not muslims! They just wanted to protect their hair/scalp from sunlight/dirt. I also wear them sometimes and it is definitely not religious!"]}
