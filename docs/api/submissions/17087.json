It sounds rather manipulative to refuse to do so with the excuse that it reminds him of past women.", "I've dated a bunch of Matthews and I absolutely *do not* get his problem. \n\nIt's your name, at this point. It's what everyone's called you since childhood. Calling you by your name is just basic respect. \n\nNTA.", "One of my best friends dated 2 women back to back with the same name. The first gf he was with 2 years and she cheated, committed identity theft with his information, physically abused him, etc. The 2nd one he ended up marrying and he never refused to call her by her name. The ex just became Voldemort for conversation purposes. NTA for wanting him to use your preferred name. He needs to grow up and forget his exes. You know how many Joshes I've dated? Lol", "I love your annoyance scale.\n\nINFO: \n\n1) He has called \\*multiple\\* exes by your childhood nickname before you even started dating?\n\n2) How long have you been together? It seems a bit odd that this came up after you'd apparently already been together for a while.\n\nWhile I completely understand your annoyance, I have to say it seems kind of nice that he wants to think only of you and to make something that is only between you.\n\nAt this point, I'm leaning NAH.", "NTA it's the name OP choose, it sounds her boyfriend isn't over his ex", "NTA. Calling you by your preferred name is such a basic form of respect that this is a huge red flag. Maybe just dump him rather than argue.", "INFO: Is this the name you commonly go by? Did he know it before or when you started dating?", "\" he\u2019s used it for other girls before. \"  \n\n\nI'm grossed out already.  \n\n\nNTA but you sound like you're going to be a notch in a headboard.", "NAH.\n\nI mean, on one hand... yeah, I can totally see reasons why someone wouldn't want to use the same nickname for someone as they used for their ex. First off, if it was the most recent ex, using that same name might give his friends and acquaintances who haven't met you the impression, in passing, that he's gotten back together with his ex. Nevermind if he associates that name with an ex who was hurtful or abusive.\n\nOn the other hand, it's your name, you can decide what you're comfortable being called.\n\nAnd on the other, third hand, the idea of having a special nickname only your partner uses is super sweet, if you guys could chose a name you're comfortable with.", "NAH. Honestly I think you need to compromise. It's not your fault his past involves girls with the same nickname as you, but CLEARLY he has associated said nicknames with them and it would be unfair to him to let him be uncomfortable for something as trivial as this. Find something personal for the both of you, something you agree on, and move on.", "NAH. I get wanted to be called by what you want. I also get not wanting to call your girlfriend like you called an ex. Something you should probably continue to talk through until you find a way you both can be comfortable. \n\nPoints for your annoyance scale, btw! You should make a full scale out of that.", "NTA and I don't blame you. I've always believed that people should be called what they want to be called, unless it's \"Your Majesty\" and you're not a royal. Has it occurred to you that your BF has baggage that he will NEVER put down?", "NAH\n\nI don't blame you for wanting to be known by a preferred name, but I also don't blame him for not being comfortable calling you by a name that raises bad memories for him.\n\nMaybe you can choose a new name together?", "BUT isn't unique cute names better? Like bf giving you a different nickname that only he uses.\n\nHis reasoning is shit though", "NAH - Nothing really happened.\n\nNow go find out a solution that makes you both comfortable.", "NAH, I don't think you're being petty. It's ok to be sad that he won't call you the nickname you'd like. But I also get his side that it can remind him of someone else. Maybe it being your name would have replaced those memories in his head by now but anyway. Hopefully he can find his own cute nickname for you that's special between the both of you?", "ESH - He gave you the reason he doesn't want to use your nickname. You should respect his wishes. He knows what you want to be called, so he should respect your wishes.... Now you all both should figure out a middle ground, even if it is just calling you by your full name.", "I think YTA\n\nYou can't expect somebody to call you something that they're not comfortable with. If it were your actual name, that'd be different. But it's a nickname.", "YTA\n\nWhile I've never dated someone with the same nickname as an ex before, I have dated someone with the same nickname as a brother.  To people who know me well (esp family) it was initially confusing, and after constantly having to clarify who I meant, I switched to calling my boyfriend by his full first name.  I imagine the confusion would be several orders of magnitude higher for your boyfriend than it was for me, since there are already multiple exes with this nickname, and when he says things like \"I went to this restaurant with El\" there's no way to tell from context clues who he means.  It's likely that him wanting to call you something different stems from other people's confusion rather than from anything he feels for you or about these exes, but it sounds like you are at least a little anxious it's the latter, since you point out the new nickname could have been a nickname for these girls' names, and I feel like you're shutting him down while he's trying to carve out a special space just for you.\n\nThe thing is, if he's the one, either you're going to grow to like him having a special name for you, or you're going to become such a staple in his life that the nickname will no longer be confusing for his friends and family, and he can start using that again.  Maybe both!  With that said, it is your name, though, so if the new nickname gives you the ick, workshop something together!  Your full name, a different nickname, a slight variation of the nickname you now use - Ellie, Ellz, something different enough to make his conversations about you easier but make sure you still feel like yourself.", "She can't get mad at him now that he has told her that that is what he used to call his ex girlfriend.  \n\nSay he introduces her to a friend of his, Hey joe I'd like for you to meet El. the friend says, do you all your girlfriends El?  Can you  see where he is just trying to avoid a problem?", "ESH\n\nYour boyfriend is disrespecting you by not using your preferred nickname.\n\nYou are disrespecting your boyfriend by insisting he use a name that brings up bad memories and trauma.\n\nYour boyfriend seems to be trying to find some middleground by creating a new name that is unique to your relationship.  \n\nMy wife has a name that sounds exactly like a former fianc\u00e9 (pronounced the same, spelled different).  Thankfully they don't have similar nicknames, because I would hate ever possibly thinking about that cheating b\\*\\*\\* when looking at the woman of my dreams.", "YTA for wanting your boyfriend to call you by nickname he associated with another girl from his past. What in the world is wrong with you that you are so insistent about this? Don't his feelings even matter to you?\n\nGirl, just get him to pick another nickname for you. In most relationships your intimate partner has a special nickname for you that's just for him to use. Do that instead.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
