Nevermind if he associates that name with an ex who was hurtful or abusive.\n\nOn the other hand, it's your name, you can decide what you're comfortable being called.\n\nAnd on the other, third hand, the idea of having a special nickname only your partner uses is super sweet, if you guys could chose a name you're comfortable with.", "NAH. Honestly I think you need to compromise. It's not your fault his past involves girls with the same nickname as you, but CLEARLY he has associated said nicknames with them and it would be unfair to him to let him be uncomfortable for something as trivial as this.

To people who know me well (esp family) it was initially confusing, and after constantly having to clarify who I meant, I switched to calling my boyfriend by his full first name.  I imagine the confusion would be several orders of magnitude higher for your boyfriend than it was for me, since there are already multiple exes with this nickname, and when he says things like \"I went to this restaurant with El\" there's no way to tell from context clues who he means.  It's likely that him wanting to call you something different stems from other people's confusion rather than from anything he feels for you or about these exes, but it sounds like you are at least a little anxious it's the latter, since you point out the new nickname could have been a nickname for these girls' names, and I feel like you're shutting him down while he's trying to carve out a special space just for you.\n\nThe thing is, if he's the one, either you're going to grow to like him having a special name for you, or you're going to become such a staple in his life that the nickname will no longer be confusing for his friends and family, and he can start using that again.  Maybe both!  With that said, it is your name, though, so if the new nickname gives you the ick, workshop something together!  Your full name, a different nickname, a slight variation of the nickname you now use - Ellie, Ellz, something different enough to make his conversations about you easier but make sure you still feel like yourself.", "She can't get mad at him now that he has told her that that is what he used to call his ex girlfriend.  \n\nSay he introduces her to a friend of his, Hey joe I'd like for you to meet El. the friend says, do you all your girlfriends El?  Can you  see where he is just trying to avoid a problem?", "ESH\n\nYour boyfriend is disrespecting you by not using your preferred nickname.\n\nYou are disrespecting your boyfriend by insisting he use a name that brings up bad memories and trauma.\n\nYour boyfriend seems to be trying to find some middleground by creating a new name that is unique to your relationship.  \n\nMy wife has a name that sounds exactly like a former fianc\u00e9 (pronounced the same, spelled different).

What in the world is wrong with you that you are so insistent about this? Don't his feelings even matter to you?\n\nGirl, just get him to pick another nickname for you.

If someone walks up to you and says 'gun' are you going to think of elephants?", "An \"ex\" he went on 3 dates with \ud83d\udc80", "Lol no he doesn't and why should she have to change her name", "I mean I'd be a little upset that he's thinking of other women in the first place", "No because most people have enough common sense not to talk about friend's ex's in front of their current partner.", "Lol trauma? What trauma? She's insisting her BF call her by her preferred name. That's it. She doesn't need to change it because BF has a problem dating girls with the same name", "It. Is. Her. Name.", "You realize this is AITA right? Lol immediately suggesting breaking up, divorce, moving out, it\u2019s abuse!!!, etc. is kind of this sub\u2019s MO. That being said, if she doesn\u2019t want him to call her Nora, he shouldn\u2019t be calling her Nora. He should call her what she asks him to (and build up positive memories of her rather than other women in regards to that name) or they should come together to figure out if there is some other nickname they both like that would work.", "He can have feelings about someones name. But they don't matter.", "If he has trauma surrounding a name, he shouldn\u2019t be dating anyone with that name, period. The insistence that OP not go by their chosen name is disrespectful. I have serious trauma surrounding the name Peyton, since it was my abuser\u2019s name. Guess what? I\u2019ve never dated another Peyton since her. It\u2019s not that hard.", "Then he shouldn't have gone out with you in the first place. And if he was \"already in love\" before he knew her name it's his job to figure it out. If this wasn't a nickname but a name without a possible nickname what would he do then. He still hears other people call her by her name. You don't just get to rename someone without their approval. Even if it's a nickname", "If his trauma doesn't let him refer to a person by their preferred name, then he should absolutely seek treatment for that trauma before trying to date someone with the specific name that is his trigger.", "My grandpa got remarried after my grandma passed. He married a woman with the same first name as my grandma. To my knowledge, this is a somewhat common name in their generation (silent generation). It's still weird to me. She has since passed. I hope he doesn't find a 3rd one.", "Lol reminds me of my Uncle, who married 3 women and two of them had the same name. My family calls them: \u201cLaura #1\u201d and \u201cLaura #2\u201d. To their faces LOL they seem to find it funny, at least.", "You know that people don't just respond to *any* voice calling their name, right? That's why tannoy announcements have to be repeated, because humans automatically filter for voices they recognize before words they recognize. A stranger calling out my name isn't going to get my attention. My husband calling it does. That's not because either of us are special, it's just how humans work. \n\nHaving a \"special nickname\" on the off chance you *might* get separated in a crowd *and* you've both forgotten your phones *and* you have no idea what the other person would do under these circumstances to make it easier to find them... It's still bloody pointless.", "You sound like you have a lot of maturing to do before you enter a long-term relationship if something as simple as a nickname would leave you simping over past one night stands instead of just loving the woman in front of you for who she is.", "My husband hasn\u2019t called me by my government name since we started dating.  He tried it once, almost ended in divorce.\n\nI don\u2019t think either of you are the AH\u2026 you\u2019re just young.  \n\nI honestly don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with a nickname that is unique to him, his reason for it is absolute shit though\u2026 I also don\u2019t think there is wrong with wanting a specific name when referencing your actual name, but it\u2019s not some hill I\u2019d die on\u2026 I prefer my whole name, and lots of people (even those I don\u2019t know well) insist on using it\u2019s short form which I hate. The most reaction is a small eye twitch, that\u2019s it.", "I could say the exact same thing about GF and her name ***preference***, but you and I both know it would be wrong to do that.\n\nHis feelings and trauma do matter and saying otherwise is delusional nonsense.", "What if he really cares about her and loves her and thus \"deals\" with her having a similar name but copes in calling her a different nickname ? \n\nOr maybe its just the nickname and not her real name that bothers him.\n\nTo much information left her and I think it's not as severe as people make it.\n\nNames are names and nothing important. Who cares if someone calls me Steve or Dave ? It's what the person feels for me and what I mean to them what's important. to me at least", "So you would rather stick to a nickname then to the person you love ? \nFeels more like just to prove a point and not back off. \n\nHow are names so important ? Our parents literally chose a random name they liked the sound of or someone they liked had that name", "Someone having trauma isn't a free ticket to allowing other people to step on it. Needing or not needing therapy doesn't change that. \n\n**C.O.M.P.R.O.M.I.S.E.**", "Don't generalize friend", "How long do you think it will take for him to ask that other people stop using your nickname too?", "Its her name. That is literally the only thing that matters. Sorry it bothers you so much personally.", "If he truly cared about her like that, he\u2019d use her chosen name. You\u2019re the outlier here, because a name isn\u2019t \u201cnothing important\u201d to most people. It\u2019s who they are. It\u2019s the word used to embody their entire personhood. It\u2019s a very personal thing, and to have your wishes about your name be disrespected is incredibly rude and cruel. If he can\u2019t be mature and call OP by her chosen name, then he needs to do the right thing and move on. You can\u2019t love someone that deeply and simultaneously disrespect their very personhood.", "This is a name everyone else calls them. There is no way to not know a person's chosen name before supposedly falling in love with them. You are fighting awfully hard to justify being completely disrespectful to another person", "I think we're having two different conversations, so I'm going to bow out. Have a good night.", "I'm just telling my pov \nStop being so personally hurt or trying to invalidate others pov with comments like that, immature and shows you can't argue", "My first boyfriend was named John. My current husband is named John. Half the men in my family are named John. Somehow I manage to remember who is what to me.", "ESH. Doesn\u2019t sound like either of you are mature enough for a relationship if you\u2019re consumed by petty bullshit like this", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nMy name is similar to the \u201cElenor\u201d comparison.\nSomeone in the comments suggested \u201cEllie\u201d as a possible compromise, but you should not have to compromise on your own name. \n\nWith that said, I had to be \u201cEllie\u201d from 2nd grade on despite the other 2 people with the same name as me having gone by \u201cElenor\u201d the entire time. I felt singled out and had a hard time answering to \u2018Ellie\u2019 as it just didn\u2019t suit me because I didn\u2019t have the choice. I tried saying no and was ignored.\n\nAnyways, it sounds like he\u2019s got to work through the trauma from the past Els, but his issues should not affect your sense of self.", "NTA but why are you with a man who so blatantly disrespects you???", "NTA. It\u2019s your name. YOUR NAME. He\u2019s being absolutely ridiculous.", "NTA but I can understand his uncomfortable-ness if his story is true. If this is something that makes you feel bad, you should listen to that. If it is something you feel you can look past, maybe a special nickname for the two of you is the right call. But if you feel he is brushing you aside, you should expect him to respect that.", "op=NTA\n\n1) you get to choose your name(if he wants an intimate name it can be hunny bunny or something).  But he should be calling you by the name you identify by.  This really isn't HARD.\n\n2) He's calling his his \"best friend\" gun--of course friend is going to support his stance.\n\nIn the end, you have to decide what consequences he will have if he doesn't use your name, or what you will put up with to keep relationship.  That being said, someone who LITERALLY, refuses to call you by your name, has respect issues.  As in he doesn't respect your identity, your thoughts/feelings.  What else does he not respect in your relationship?  Your time, Your plans, your belongings, your money?", "Seriously. People renaming other people against their will makes my hackles rise.", "It. Is. A. Childhood. Nick. Name.", "Plot twist!  Her name is SpongeRoberta."]}
