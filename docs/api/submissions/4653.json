My recommendation is that she call her mother \"mom\" and you two come up with a new name for her to call you.  Maybe it's Mimi or Mama or something similar.

Look, I get you not wanting to disrespect a woman who has been absent from her biological daughter's life for 6+ out of the 7 years she's been alive. However, I think if you have been in a committed relationship with her father, which involves being a mother figure, you need to understand that you will get called mom. The child's feelings on the subject ought to take priority than the feelings you are projecting on the absent bio-mom. \n\nAlso ... plenty of people have more than one mom for all sorts of reasons.\n\nLastly, if YOU feel uncomfortable being dubbed a mother (which is not what you wrote - you wrote it was because of the living bio mom), then it's time to re-evaluate the relationship with the girl's father. If you don't want to be a parent right now, well maybe you should've broken it off 5-6 years ago, but you definitely shouldn't do any further damage to the kid and her father by prolonging the relationship any further.", "YTA", "Holy asshole.

I can see both points here.", "YTA. You never even considered her feelings in this. She is at an age where she\u2019s probably very well aware that her bio mom doesn\u2019t want much to do with her. Having gone through that myself I can tell you it hurts. You have been there for the majority of her life, married to her dad, and you say you do all of these things to bond with her. You are her mom! She sees your value and expressed that verbally. But you tell her no? Now she, at 7 years old, has been rejected by 2 of the most important women in her life.", "NTA. \n\n1. you are not the kids mother\n2. you explained to her that you are not her mother\n3. you do not want to be a mother, fine, she should accept that now that she's 7 before she wants you to be like introduced as her mom and shit at parent teacher meetings and things like that", "Cruel and disgusting YTA", "Yup you're a major AH.

This comes with the territory when marrying a single parent.  You did the work and did it very well where you have a bond with the child.

We later talked about what to call him and decided on a name that was symbolically special to us.  \n\nThe point is, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for trying to respect everyone, but you could have been way more tactful.  And I think all the comments comparing you to other step parents who would love to be called mom are unnecessarily harsh.  Clearly your SD adores you and that counts for a lot.  \n\nBut at this point you and your husband should have had a rational conversation to address this.  You\u2019re right, she still has a mother, absent though she may be, and she calls her \u201cmom.\u201d  A 7 year old is smart enough to understand why this would be confusing.  Maybe you could all find a name together.  She could call you mom [insert your name], or in another language, such as M\u00e8re or M\u00e3e.  The point is to have that special social connection.  \n\nI refuse to call you an AH when you already do this much and she obviously loves you.
