Look, I get you not wanting to disrespect a woman who has been absent from her biological daughter's life for 6+ out of the 7 years she's been alive. However, I think if you have been in a committed relationship with her father, which involves being a mother figure, you need to understand that you will get called mom. The child's feelings on the subject ought to take priority than the feelings you are projecting on the absent bio-mom. \n\nAlso ... plenty of people have more than one mom for all sorts of reasons.\n\nLastly, if YOU feel uncomfortable being dubbed a mother (which is not what you wrote - you wrote it was because of the living bio mom), then it's time to re-evaluate the relationship with the girl's father.

I can see both points here.", "YTA. You never even considered her feelings in this. She is at an age where she\u2019s probably very well aware that her bio mom doesn\u2019t want much to do with her. Having gone through that myself I can tell you it hurts. You have been there for the majority of her life, married to her dad, and you say you do all of these things to bond with her.

This comes with the territory when marrying a single parent.  You did the work and did it very well where you have a bond with the child.

We later talked about what to call him and decided on a name that was symbolically special to us.  \n\nThe point is, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for trying to respect everyone, but you could have been way more tactful.  And I think all the comments comparing you to other step parents who would love to be called mom are unnecessarily harsh.  Clearly your SD adores you and that counts for a lot.  \n\nBut at this point you and your husband should have had a rational conversation to address this.  You\u2019re right, she still has a mother, absent though she may be, and she calls her \u201cmom.\u201d  A 7 year old is smart enough to understand why this would be confusing.  Maybe you could all find a name together.  She could call you mom [insert your name], or in another language, such as M\u00e8re or M\u00e3e.  The point is to have that special social connection.  \n\nI refuse to call you an AH when you already do this much and she obviously loves you.  Just pull on some big girl pants and FIX THIS.", "YTA, you never tell a child that. Instead thank them for the honor of calling you that particular title. You can add mommy-name or daddy-name. Anything other than squashing the feelings of a young child.", "YTA, it was a passing comment to you. But I absolutely guarantee she\u2019s going to remember those 20 seconds for the rest of her life. This was not the way to address the issue.", "YTA. Being a mom is more than biology. You are there. You care about and for her. You are doing all the things a mother should do. Ergo, you're the mom now. Screw the deadbeat ex, she's nuked her relationship with this child from orbit all on her own.", "YTA. If you don't want to be called right now (or ever), that's fine. What you shouldn't have done is taken it upon yourself to immediately shut her down with a flippant rejection in that incredibly vulnerable moment. You needed to let it be and then have a discussion with your husband on how to handle this and have a measured, compassionate discussion about it with her in a healthy way. Instead, you've given this poor child a complex that's probably going to follow her through her entire upbringing.\n\nI hope she's in therapy.", "YTA - why tf would you marry someone with a child if you're not going to be a step parent?", "YTA\n\nYou made it perfectly clear that HIS daughter will never be YOUR daughter, which means you probably wish her father hadn't come with baggage.\n\nGood luck explaining that away.", "NTA. I think how you handled it sucked, and I think you owe her an apology, but it\u2019s okay to not feel comfortable being called mom by someone else\u2019s child (even if you\u2019re the step parent). You may want to have a conversation with her about choosing an endearment that your both comfortable with.", "I understand you were trying to be respectful and do the best you can as a stepmother. However, this was not the way. You should have let it slide, discuss with your husband and then talk to her. \n\nNow, sit down and explain to your husband you do want the parenting role and love her with all your heart but you believe the title \"mom\" should go to her birth mother. You can figure another title out, mama, mimi, etc, or even she addresses her bio mom as \"mother\" and you as \"mom\". Explain that you feel uncomfortable for the fact that you feel like you are taking her place and that is something you don't want to do.\n\nAfter, talk to the kid, explain again how you love her with all your heart and will be with her and to you she is your daughter. Say that you loved being close to her and how amazing it felt that she feels close to you to call you mom and it would be an honor. Explain that she does have a bio mom and since she is still (somewhat) present she should have a title, ask how she feels calling her \"what you decided\" and you \"what you decided\". But no pressure and you understand you responded wrongly to her show of love and you are very sorry.\n\nAt least this is what I would do.\n\nYTA because you crushed a little girls heart, but not intentionally so soft yta.", "ESH. You and your partner should have discussed this moment.", "NTA but you should have been cautious when you said : \"I'm not your mother you can't call me that\". \n\nMaybe you could have said \"Sweetie, I understand that you see me as your mother. But I don't know if it is very wise to call me that. I love you. I like my name and I like to be called by my name as you like to be called by yours\".", "YTA Jesus, being nice is hard for you isn\u2019t it??", "YTA  you are effectively the child's mom.  This was a huge gift from the child to you and you hurt this kid beyond belief.", "YTA, but only for correcting her in front of other people.", "YTA. You do the work, you get the title and the perks that come w/ doing the job well.\n\nAlso, someone CAN call 2 people mom.\n\nTalk to her and tell her you love her and think of her as your daughter and you were poroud abd very happy that she wanted to call you mom. When she called you mom you immediately were worried about  how her mother's feelings - you didn't want to make her unhappy. Now you realize that it is far more important what SHE wants and how SHE feels and you are deeply sorry and she can call you by your name or mom or a special nickname, whatevevr works for her, but you know she is your daughter and you will love her and be there for her no matter what.", "I have been in your shoes, I had the same concerns, but I have learned it\u2019s best to let them call you mom. \n\nYou are not disrespecting her biomom. Biomom has abdicated her role. You can still talk about her positively, but her not being present in her life is a huge factor. \n\nYour stepdaughter at an age where she\u2019s learning about family relationships and names in school. So even though she\u2019s never called you mom before, she\u2019s learning what that means to others, she\u2019s reflecting on who that is for her, and you are the person that fits that role for her. She understandably wants what other kids have. \n\nYou are her only chance at a loving, involved mother figure. Do you want that experience to be cold and compartmentalized, or one of warmth and connection? \n\nThis was the age where the shift came for my stepson as well. And where I also had to make the shift in my thinking. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t call me \u201cmom\u201d all the time, but when it comes to mom gifts and other mom things, I\u2019m the one he puts there now. And I just let him because it\u2019s what makes him feel happy and loved to have someone to put there, especially someone who has chosen to be there.\n\nNAH. It\u2019s a lot to navigate and we rarely do it perfectly.", "Gentle YTA. You said yourself that her bio mom isnt in the picture much at all. So this little girl looks to you as her mother figure. You cant steal a title someone else hasnt even earned.\n\nI get it. Youre the step mom and you're trying to tread lightly and not step on toes here. But she did it. She called you mom. You didnt try to force it on her, it happened all on its own.", "YTA. I was in the kids' place when I was young, and I called my step-dad \"dad\" one day. He sat me down and said that he was okay with it as long as I'm aware and recognize that I have a biological father. My bio dad was in the picture, but it wasn't a healthy relationship. My step-dad was more of a dad to me than my bio dad, and he had a way of handling these situations that made me feel loved, heard, and respected. He didn't tell me what to do in this situation. He just told me what he felt I needed to know to make a decision. \nThis might have made you uncomfortable, but this girl obviously sees you as a positive role model, an opinion you probably just destroyed. Kids of divorce have a hard time trusting, and you most likely just lost hers. Good luck trying to get that back.", "And knowing her bio mom is mostly absent, she\u2019s now been rejected by more than one mother.", "I agree but will go with gentle YTA because I do think OP thought the title mom should be reserved for bio mom. BUT that being said, if she just feels weird mainly because her step-daughter is calling her mom rather than her name, and this isn't something she has a strong objection about, I do think she should be ok with being called mom.", "I love this idea!  \n\nMaybe explain a bit more to the child in an age appropriate way about why actually being called mom ( because she does actually have a live mom, even tho she doesn\u2019t see her) might not be the best name as opposed to whatever other name they come up with. Just so the little girl doesn\u2019t feel totally rejected.", ">Although, you have every right to feel the way you do about being called \"mom\". Just remember, SO many step mothers would feel honored to be close enough to their stepchild to be called mom.\n\nIn deed. But let's not guilt trip people because they have what other people wants. That's very unfair to OP.", "Rephrase that in the PAST tense :(", "Yep. Just like a shattered plate that was repaired things will never be the same. YTA OP.", "Op even says she was trying to be a mother figure. Why would you go to the effort to bond with a kid like  that if you don't want to be her mom. That's just unnecessarily cruel. This poor kid will absolutely remember this forever. When I was 7-8, in a fit of anger my mom said some awful things about me being an accident and my brother being the kid they actually planned for. It hurt so fucking much and and I've never forgotten it, even if my mom doesn't remember it at all. I'll always think about how my mom loves my brother more than me.", "FIY your judgement contradicts your statement ;)", "No, but being a carer doesn't make you a parent either.", "I mean, that is great for those step parents.  But if OP doesn't want that, doesn't she get a say?", "^This... Perfect response. NTA", "She\u2019s already replaced her, as she sees her everyday and the biological mother does not. What did OP think was going to happen raising a child from the age of one, I\u2019m surprised she hasn\u2019t called her mom before now.", "I agree. If OP isn't comfortable taking the mom title then she doesn't have to. Doesn't mean she doesn't love the child", "No, don\u2019t marry someone with a young child if you don\u2019t want to be a parent. Her biological mother isn\u2019t really in her life, of course the child sees OP as her mother.", "Exactly my point. OP has every right to feel how she feels. I just think it's good to take all things into consideration. No guilt tripping here", "If the child is 7, the adults have failed her by not discussing their preferences and preparing for this.  She rarely sees her actual mom and is very young, it's natural to think this might come up, and shows a lack of forethought on OP and her husband's part.   Technically I don't think OP is TA for not wanting to be called \"mom\" but is kinda for not preparing for this and for handling it poorly. I doubt the child will ever forget that reaction,  sadly.", "If she doesn't want a kid she shouldn't have dated a single father. She's just ruined the relationship she had with her step kid. Poor kid", "Then she shouldn\u2019t have dated a single dad", "I think you can be a parental figure without being called mom or dad."]}
