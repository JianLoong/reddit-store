Look, I get you not wanting to disrespect a woman who has been absent from her biological daughter's life for 6+ out of the 7 years she's been alive. However, I think if you have been in a committed relationship with her father, which involves being a mother figure, you need to understand that you will get called mom. The child's feelings on the subject ought to take priority than the feelings you are projecting on the absent bio-mom. \n\nAlso ... plenty of people have more than one mom for all sorts of reasons.\n\nLastly, if YOU feel uncomfortable being dubbed a mother (which is not what you wrote - you wrote it was because of the living bio mom), then it's time to re-evaluate the relationship with the girl's father. If you don't want to be a parent right now, well maybe you should've broken it off 5-6 years ago, but you definitely shouldn't do any further damage to the kid and her father by prolonging the relationship any further.", "YTA", "Holy asshole.

I can see both points here.", "YTA. You never even considered her feelings in this. She is at an age where she\u2019s probably very well aware that her bio mom doesn\u2019t want much to do with her. Having gone through that myself I can tell you it hurts. You have been there for the majority of her life, married to her dad, and you say you do all of these things to bond with her. You are her mom! She sees your value and expressed that verbally. But you tell her no? Now she, at 7 years old, has been rejected by 2 of the most important women in her life.", "NTA. \n\n1. you are not the kids mother\n2. you explained to her that you are not her mother\n3. you do not want to be a mother, fine, she should accept that now that she's 7 before she wants you to be like introduced as her mom and shit at parent teacher meetings and things like that", "Cruel and disgusting YTA", "Yup you're a major AH.

This comes with the territory when marrying a single parent.  You did the work and did it very well where you have a bond with the child.

We later talked about what to call him and decided on a name that was symbolically special to us.  \n\nThe point is, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for trying to respect everyone, but you could have been way more tactful.  And I think all the comments comparing you to other step parents who would love to be called mom are unnecessarily harsh.  Clearly your SD adores you and that counts for a lot.  \n\nBut at this point you and your husband should have had a rational conversation to address this.  You\u2019re right, she still has a mother, absent though she may be, and she calls her \u201cmom.\u201d  A 7 year old is smart enough to understand why this would be confusing.  Maybe you could all find a name together.  She could call you mom [insert your name], or in another language, such as M\u00e8re or M\u00e3e.  The point is to have that special social connection.  \n\nI refuse to call you an AH when you already do this much and she obviously loves you.

I think since you also have your mom, what if we call me Mama OP?\" Or something, and the child had stil responded negatively, I would have said N T A, but that's not what happened here.

The fact that she cares more about \"not disrespecting\" a woman who's barely even in the child's life, than the child's wants and needs is just so heart breaking to me.

You can make this right, especially if you are willing to get creative and to express your love for kiddo throughout this process, but seriously -- you seem to be a little surprised by all this for someone who's been in role for half a decade.

Not developmentally, not emotionally, not physically. \n\nAdults have had a lifetime to mature. They have seen and lived through experiences which, ideally, should have taught them to manage their emotions, impulses, and urges in a healthy way that is beneficial to the community. Adults should be able to set healthy boundaries, but also capable of emotional altruism -- of being able to tell when compassion or forgiveness is warranted; of being able to deduce from context when their own emotional discomfort is a feeling that needs to be faced as a learning experience instead of used as a shield. Adults who shy away from learning from emotional discomfort are the kind of people who end up avoiding questions about fallacious generational beliefs and cultural expectations. \n\nChildren -- especially when they're under 10 -- are still in their \"first experiences\" phase. First time walking -- followed by the first bump and bruise. First time talking, followed by the first pronunciation errors. First time sharing a big emotion, and eventually the first shutdown. First crush, and first heartbreak. \n\nAdults-- all adults, I would argue, not just a child's parents/ caretakers -- play an important role in helping shape children into functioning adults. It's a careful tightrope to walk: take away too much difficulty, and the child never learns resilience in the face of hardship. Give too much hardship, and the child experiences trauma. \n\nPersonally, I think growth opportunities that have to do with learning and exploring the world are where parents should be more hands off -- children should understand that learning isn't easy; that it requires mistakes and exploration and takes trial and error, and the best way to learn that is through lived experience.\n\nI also think parents/ caretakers should be more hands on in explicitly teaching their children how to recognize, name, and manage their emotions. But these are a difficult lessons to teach after shattering a child's trust, so I personally would argue that OP is very much TA because she CHOSE to date and marry a man with a daughter, and CHOSE to take on that role, so OP should put on her big girl pants and act like a grown up adult who can manage her own big scary emotions instead of expecting a CHILD to do it.", "The kid in question though is only 7 years old, has known OP as long as she\u2019s had memories, and rarely sees her bio-mom if ever.

I would never in a million years have responded the way OP did. I love her, to this day, like she\u2019s my own child. At least 50% of the time for multiple years, I was her parent. Her mom has primary custody now after what happened that caused me to separate with her dad and he only sees her one day a week now, if that. I\u2019m now out of state (again this is due to the severity of what happened), and I\u2019m not close to her mom. I don\u2019t get to see her, but I see her likeness in my youngest son\u2019s face and think of her literally every day. I miss her like crazy, even though I was never her only mom. I can\u2019t imagine being in OPs situation and not loving that child wholeheartedly regardless of what she called me.", "Not wanting to be called \"mom\" specifically isn't what makes her an asshole. OP has been around for 6/7 years of this girl's life as a mother figure, and the first thing she does when this child whose bio mom never sees her calls her mom is to say \"I'm not your mother, you can't call me that\". That's an incredibly cruel way to say you're \"uncomfortable\" to a child without a mom.\n\nShe married into a completely normal single-parent household. She's had six years to come to terms with the fact that she was marrying someone with a kid.", "I actually agree with this - its not cool to be married to someone with a baby that you'll see full time and refuse to be their parental figure.  Its hurtful and likely traumatic to the child.", "I swear I\u2019ve seen a post where a lady let her kids call her husbands parents grandma and grandpa and everyone said she was TA because they should get to pick what they\u2019re called\u2026", "Because people think that this kid is going to be traumatized for the rest of her life, which... I doubt. \n\nOP seems confused and genuinely concerned in her post. I haven't seen any comments (haven't looked that hard) but it reads to me that she made a mistake in the moment. But otherwise has parented to kid rather well. \n\nConversations should have happened between OP and her husband a LONG time ago. I'm sure the kid brought it up to her dad at some point. If not, then he should also have been a bit surprised if she's called OP by her first name for years. \n\nI do think this is salvageable. It's going to require OP and the husband to speak to the daughter, though, and be gentle, kind, understanding, and rebuilding that trust. Maybe OP is okay with \"mom\" eventually. Maybe they make a new name. But the only way OP would remain a total AH, in my mind, is if she doubles down and still says that only the deadbeat mom deserves the \"mom\" or any similar title.", "Right?

She's been around since she was 1 year old. \n\nIf you decide you don't want to be a parent do that before you get married and especially before you build a emotional bond with the kid.\n\nLike, this is entirely her own fault and the way she is low-key trying to shove the blame on the 7 year old is also just gross. \n\nLike she doesn't even awknowledg that she fucked up here, she isn't considerate of her step daughters' feelings at all. \n\nShe is a grown adult and should have been aware that her actions could lead to this outcome. It doesn't need a rocket scientist to see this coming, the girls bio mom is hardly around, she most likley has abandonment issues, her step mom shows a interest and treats her like a daughter, obviously she would start viewing her as a second mother. \n\nOP is absolutely the Asshole in this situation. She is who caused this due to not thinking things through. \n\nThis situation shouldn't have happened in the first place and OP is a asshole for carelessly bringing a little child's hopes up only to reject said child in a cruel manner.", "> Jeez, if it was the other way around and OP wanted to be called mom but the kid refused, the tone shift would be immense.\n\nAdults and 7-year-olds are not treated the same for a reason.

And in this case, OP is being called TA for telling the child what to call her.\n\nI think the argument here is that OP, in marrying someone with a young child, needed to take the needs of that child into account before committing to a marriage. If OP didn\u2019t want to be \u201cmom,\u201d that\u2019s potentially harmful to the child and should have been disclosed before the marriage.
