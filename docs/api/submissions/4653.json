Look, I get you not wanting to disrespect a woman who has been absent from her biological daughter's life for 6+ out of the 7 years she's been alive. However, I think if you have been in a committed relationship with her father, which involves being a mother figure, you need to understand that you will get called mom. The child's feelings on the subject ought to take priority than the feelings you are projecting on the absent bio-mom. \n\nAlso ... plenty of people have more than one mom for all sorts of reasons.\n\nLastly, if YOU feel uncomfortable being dubbed a mother (which is not what you wrote - you wrote it was because of the living bio mom), then it's time to re-evaluate the relationship with the girl's father.

I can see both points here.", "YTA. You never even considered her feelings in this. She is at an age where she\u2019s probably very well aware that her bio mom doesn\u2019t want much to do with her. Having gone through that myself I can tell you it hurts. You have been there for the majority of her life, married to her dad, and you say you do all of these things to bond with her.

This comes with the territory when marrying a single parent.  You did the work and did it very well where you have a bond with the child.

We later talked about what to call him and decided on a name that was symbolically special to us.  \n\nThe point is, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for trying to respect everyone, but you could have been way more tactful.  And I think all the comments comparing you to other step parents who would love to be called mom are unnecessarily harsh.  Clearly your SD adores you and that counts for a lot.  \n\nBut at this point you and your husband should have had a rational conversation to address this.  You\u2019re right, she still has a mother, absent though she may be, and she calls her \u201cmom.\u201d  A 7 year old is smart enough to understand why this would be confusing.  Maybe you could all find a name together.  She could call you mom [insert your name], or in another language, such as M\u00e8re or M\u00e3e.  The point is to have that special social connection.  \n\nI refuse to call you an AH when you already do this much and she obviously loves you.

The fact that she cares more about \"not disrespecting\" a woman who's barely even in the child's life, than the child's wants and needs is just so heart breaking to me.

It\u2019s unfortunate, and yes, an asshole move, but again, one made out of ignorance and surprise rather than out of vindictiveness. There is still plenty of room for OP to learn and quickly remedy this. I think its a good idea to explain to the daughter that its because the title is already taken by her bio mom rather than OP not wanting to be her mother and that she would love to come up with a similar \u201cmom\u201d name to go by. Its too late to try to claim the title \u201cmom,\u201d but this is definitely still salvageable. We don\u2019t need to vilify people who made an asshole decision as a mistake; save that for people who are unwilling to change and/or are trying to spread negativity. \n\n-from someone who has two stepparents and oodles of grandparents (and has successfully used different names for all)", "She doesn't consent to be called 'mom' and consent is the only thing that matters here.", "Yeah she had every right to come into this little girls life, try to be a mother figure, then make the kid feel rejected when she finally calls her mom.

Her mother is flittering around. She has been abandoned by her mother. If a seven year old little girl needs to call you mother  after a period of calling you by name , there is a leap of faith she took in you. You choked.   Desperation from this girl is your fear. You do not feel you are capable of giving her the love she will certainly need. Maybe you did not have a loving relationship with your mother. You are forgetting you are the adult in control. It's not \"all about you\" always in life.  Sometimes, you have to be altruistic in your actions in life. She needs you to lean on during this tender age. It is a huge opportunity  for you to save this girls future.  The father needs you. Her mother does not deserve to be put on some respect pedestal. I hope this girl finds the love that will save her.

But it doesn't sound like this is the case here.\n\nMy stepkids never called me dad.  I never pressured them to do so, that was a choice that they had to make once they were ready and comfortable.  Neither of them ever called me Dad, they each had their own personal reasons why, and I've always respected that.  However, I oldest recently told me that out of the three father figures that she has had in her life, that I was the one most deserving of the title.\n\nMy heart would have melted and I would have embraced those kids with the hardest of bear hugs a step parent can fathom if they ever just once called me Dad.\n\nThis girl's biomom cheated on her dad before she could barely walk and talk.

Also, whether you like it or not, his daughter will take priority over you when push comes to shove.  You say so yourself in your post, this girl hasn't had the best mother figure in her life. So you took her out to do girly things and form a bond with her.  She too saw and felt this bond.  So strongly in fact that she decided to call you mom for the first time.  After all, you're the best mother figure she has had in her short life.

My son has a grandma that is Nana and another that is grams.", "Agreed here.  My oldest step-daughter told my mom a secret once.  The secret was that for Christmas a few months away, she was going to get me a necklace that said \"Mom\" on it and start calling me \"momma\" after that.

If I had rejected that poor kid's gesture... I can't even imagine how much that would have crushed her spirit and hurt our relationship.\n\nOP has been working hard, it seems to build a great parental-type relationship with her stepdaughter.

I\u2019m gonna have a conversation to explain my fucked up response so that this kid doesn\u2019t think that I\u2019m rejecting them as a human and family member, and maybe we can find a different moniker since I\u2019m not comfortable with the \u2018mom\u2019 title.\u201d\n\nInstead she seems completely oblivious to the damage she\u2019s caused.\n\nEdit: also how the fuck was this not prepared for during the 6 years she\u2019s been in that child\u2019s life. \n\nUghhh\u2026.", "This is a conversation to be prepared for. I'd expect any adult coming into a child's life to have discussed these things with the child's parent and to have a plan for how to handle things as they come up. The fact she had to think on her feet after 6 years... That's awful. I have all kinds of conversations planned for the kids I mentor. Ways to set boundaries that are appropriate for the setting I'm in. And they're all individualized somewhat to each kid. Because I don't want to hurt them.", ">expecting them to suddenly be able to do so because a kid is involved\n\nIs reasonable and right. \n\nOr what else is the point?", "Anyone can wait a beat before they blurt out whatever nonsense first crossed their mind. Granted that takes practice of will power and compassion for the audience to whom you\u2019re speaking. Two things anyone in their FORTIES AND A PARENT should be modeling. A simple analogy you might not think is crazy that most all folks do with ease is not cursing around children. You kind of don\u2019t even have to think about it. Likewise any adult topics. This theme that OP posted is any adult topic to be discussed between adults. And if OP doesn\u2019t feel like a parent (as she clearly doesn\u2019t) she should defer to the father, again in closed conversation.", "Don\u2019t be afraid. She\u2019s not abandoning the child. She\u2019s just not accepting the title. Plenty of people acquire spouses and that spouse has nothing to do with the parenting but is just an adult figure/friend or whatever in the kids lives. \n\nJust make sure you find a woman who doesn\u2019t mind fully immersing herself into that motherly role. You make sure you have that conversation early on and then pay close attention to how said woman treats your children. You can avoid this. Just communicate, effectively. \n\nOp isn\u2019t going to bond with this child any less if she has the know-with-all to help the little girl not to push her away because she\u2019s hurt. Which could happen in this scenario. The kid just needs to learn why they feel\nThe way they feel and it\u2019s on the adults to help her with that.", "i kind think with the title, its up for the child to decide.", "I raised my nephew from a young age. Yes it was startling and uncomfortable the first time he called me mom but I pushed past it. I was fulfilling his need for a mom and doing all the motherly things for him after all. He wanted to call me mom and that meant the world to me. So I got used to it. After the initial discomfort I came to love it.", "This needs to be higher in all posts", "I can't believe it has so many up votes. A 42 year old woman's feelings matter and the 7 year olds don't!? The hell....", "I feel like this is the classic AITA 'leave him!!' upscaled by 1000. OP clearly wasn't prepared for this moment and needs to figure out a way to handle it better, but I think saying she needs to leave the relationship is a bit of a leap without more info.", "Well said! \n\nYes. \nTry being a fucking fellow human.", "THIS a million times.  She had to have seen this coming. I disagree though -- I don't think she has any concerns about disrespecting the bio Mom. I think she's just saying that to soften her crap response.\n\nThis whole thing is just heartbreaking. Poor kid!!!", "It\u2019s delusional. People\u2019s cognitive capacity doesn\u2019t upgrade itself because you think it should.\n\nAs other people have said, she and her husband should have pregamed this, and should pregame other stuff that\u2019s likely to come up."]}
