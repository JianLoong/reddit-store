The issue is that he doesn\u2019t clean. He makes dinner and leaves food out and dirty dishes out for days, he leaves food in the fridge until it\u2019s rotten and mouldy.\n\nMy sister and I always clean up for him, we started trying to do \u2018big house cleans\u2019 and saying \u2018I\u2019m gonna change all the beds- could u start vacuuming?\u2019 And he would argue, he would always blame the mess on us. We would clean the food off the floor when we first got to his house after being away for 2 weeks, we would scoop the piles of ants off the rotting food and clean up his mess on our floor (the shared living room).\n\nWe finally talked to him and said it\u2019s getting ridiculous, the house always smells, we always clean, there are ants everywhere. He said it\u2019s bc we don\u2019t clean up, so my sister and I made a point this time to only clean our mess, to only wash our dishes, to only do our laundry. The house got unbearable, Now he has our Nonna involved saying we need to help dad. Dad is saying we need to stop being lazy and to help him, that it\u2019s our house not his. \n\nI can\u2019t deal with this anymore, the mess our brother and dad make and don\u2019t clean up is never ending- he has a rent inspection coming up- we have been away for a month with our mother and he wants us to do a big family house clean however there are three big floors of this house and it\u2019s a bomb site of his dirty washing and dishes.\n\nSo, is my sister and I the asshole for saying we wouldn\u2019t do a house clean but just clean our floor?", "created_utc": 1672651159, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1018bsi/aita_for_refusing_to_clean_the_house/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you keep cleaning up after him you\u2019re just enabling this unhealthy behavior.", "I notice how you said your brother makes mess as well. So the gendered expectations have been passed onto the next generation. Nice!\n\nNTA, of course. I had an ex like this. He was just blind to the housework I did. Always accused me of not doing enough, especially dishes. I decided to do what you did, only washed up my own stuff. Never left anything for him to do, but he saw that as him doing 100% of the washing up. And when I pointed out that it was all his dishes, none of mine, he said \u201cwe\u2019re not at college! We are a couple, it\u2019s not about yours and mine, they\u2019re our dishes!\u201d\n\nStill makes me angry nearly 10 years later!", "YNTAH. How long till you are 18 and no longer need to go there?\n\n\n\nOr;do one final whole house clean so it is spotless and gleaming before you leave. Take videos of how spotless it is.", "NTA.

He doesn't need people picking up after him.\n\n(On the basis there is not a genuine reason why he can't do anything.)", "NTA His behavior and hypocrisy are astounding and it was smart of your mom to get out of there when she could.", "NTA \n\nSimple!", "NTA. I wonder if he seriously believes himself when he days it's you.", "NTA tell him to treat you like his daughter not his maid", "NTA\n\nWhat's he going to do when you no longer go and visit him and there is no one to clean for him?  How old is your other other (not your twin).  Will he have to continue going?", "NTA, he's taking you guys for ride, just stop.", "NTA !! I would definitely not clean after him... not your job!! Get as many pictures of all and ask your mom to report it for her to get full custody (esp. for your little bro! He needs to learn that is not the correct way to live, women are not maid !)  \n\nALSO.... His behavior has been enabled for years by his mother, Ex-wife/your mom and you (both Sisters).. As you said, he never did and just blamed others for it... Therefore I am sure he is living in a fantasy world (Disney kinda style probably), where all the women are just his help and he is too good for this task.. yikes! He needs to learn the hard way, leave him in his filth and let him rot.. (sorry to say it like that but your dad is not worth your energy! Stay away from it.. he is toxic!)", "NTA, I used to live with my brother who's like that too. We made a rule to do the dishes each a turn, didn't work because on his turn he kept piling it up and he'd blame me for adding more dishes on his turn. Then we took duct tape, split the counter top in half and let each have their own dishes on their half. And if someone doesn't clean a dish and the other needs to use it, he may put it back on the person's side who didn't clean it. Long story short, his half was always full of dirty dishes, and he couldn't blame me anymore. He blames everyone but himself for everything going wrong in his life, I'm glad I now live 9600km away from him.", "NTA. Having kids on a dirty place? Great parenting\u2026 makes him fit to have custody of children", "NTA. I would take photos when I left after I cleaned and say if it doesn't look like this when we return, then I am not going to clean because we didn't make the mess. You are NOT his mother or wife and he needs to put his big boy pants on and be a parent. He will be totally stunned when you no longer want to go over and stay because you are sick of his mess.", "NTA don't do it, don't go there either. He is a grown man, he should be ashamed of himself for asking his mom to clean, it is not only a woman's job!", "NTA, sorry to say it sounds like you've just got a shit dad.", "NTA. You\u2019re not his maid and he\u2019s being unreasonable.", "NTA. If possible, just stop going over there for a while. You are not his maid", "NTA\n\nIt's his mess let him clean it up.\n\nthe rentinspection will probably give him a big vine and an order to clean\n\nIf possible leave that pigsty and go to your mom and stay there.\n\nyou are not your fathers servants", "NTA\n\nLet dad be the grown up he is supposed to be.

It is not just work for females.", "NTA. Can you not avoid going there at all ?", "NTA and his home is unfit for care. Might be worth bringing up with your mom/her lawyer in regards to visitation.
