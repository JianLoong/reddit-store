And then who sleeps with them and tells them (implicitly) that this is ok? JFC.  What the hell is he thinking?", " Sure, but this is not that. End of the day, if that's where he wants to store his socks, who says your preference wins? Who made you Queen Of The Home?  You need to learn to compromise. In the big picture, this is a non-issue, a stupid issue  to fight dirty about.", "This way is NTA.", "An interesting take. Seems like a weird hill to die on to me, if he's improved in so many areas and just leaves socks around, it doesn't feel inappropriate to me to just compromise and let it go, rather than escalating.", "I would have recognized that nobody is perfect and I doubtless do things that bother him, that a relationship is about compromise and not everything is worth the price of fixing.\n\nThis is definitely an ESH situation, BF is definitely also an ahole (though this all being as petty as it is that feels like an overstatement in both directions), but the moral high ground was surrendered, is all I'm saying", "From the title, I don't believe OP is a woman.", "Yeah but your mum probably taught you how to respect that \n\nMy mum would have tore me a new one if I\u2019d stuffed socks down her sofa, that\u2019s just not really on", "Same. Hearing how female friends' put up with their s/o's who refuse to do chores is wild to me, if my gf complained to my mom about picking up slack I'd be dead lmao", "This was three years ago. He has been domesticated in the ways on how basic appliances work! I agree I shouldn\u2019t have had to show him, but love makes you so crazy things.", "This is what I think reading 70% of these posts.", "you waited 3 YEARS before doing this?? honey, YTA to yourself\n\nthree years, I can't even", "My ex husband used to shove socks under the couch. He never picked them up. The socks under the couch wasn\u2019t the reason he became an ex but man, it was sloppy and I should have known better when he kept doing it despite my repeated and reasonable requests to not.\n\nNTA, by the way. This is a classic case of fuck around and find out - if your dogs are anything like mine, your training was pretty minimal and they were thrilled to find a new tug toy!", "Who wants to sit or lie on a couch full of dirty socks, especially someone elses dirty socks.  As long as the dogs arent eating the socks and you say they dont eat fabric, I thinks its great.\n\nNTA", "If you\u2019re going to use the same word multiple times, might as well spell it correctly. \n\nServant**", "This is the way. NTA", "I do agree, but reading OPs other comments the socks are in the couch daily, with 3 years worth of asks to not do this. I also know this is a pet order of mine, so I'm definitely biased, as my stepdad would leave his socks everywheeeeere and it drove me bonkers.", "Stuffing smelly used socks into the couch is gross, sorry.", "You want a couch that smells like day old socks?  If socks are being stuffed into the couch multiple times a week, that couch smells like feet.  It's disgusting.  Let the dogs destroy until there are no socks left, OPs partner can figure it out.", "We recently got one of my dogs in December. The first dog never really was interested in tug of war toys, was always content with bones. But our second dog was a little younger and full of energy.", "This is the way. NTA", "I think the point was it took you that long to do something serious about the situation, dogs or not.", "my point was just dogs or no dogs, there's no way you should have subjected yourself to this for 3 years\n\nif you want to spend the effort training a man, make sure it's a man who is actually trainable/gives a shit\n\nyou've been acting as his maid for essentially 3 years, however much he's \"progressed\" in that period of time he hasn't even stopped shoving his dirty socks in the couch\n\nhow many hours of your life have you spent cleaning up after him? \n\nhow many hours have you spent trying to teach someone who is doing everything in his power not to learn? \n\nhow many hours have you spent fighting with him about this stuff? \n\nand after 3 years you finally did something about one of these tiny things, then spent your own money to replace the socks - before he even found out, and feel guilty enough to post here, even if you're only looking for validation it's because you need the validation\n\nthat indicates some shit\n\nnow look, I'm just seeing a snapshot of your life and so maybe this is a tiny portion of your relationship. maybe he does a lot of other cleaning around the house. or does all the cooking and all the grocery shopping and carries the mental load. maybe you're not constantly reminding him of every tiny thing and acting as a household manager. maybe fights over this stuff is rare and it's just one area where he has a bad habit and doesn't respect you and that's not reflective of the rest of your relationship\n\nso if I'm wrong feel free to tell me\n\nbut generally if someone is this wildly disrespectful of you in one way that's usually not an exception but the rule. generally if someone stuff their socks in the sofa that is not the exception to their overall cleanliness it's the rule. generally if someone doesn't clean around the house they don't do other things around the house and they don't appreciate the person who does those things for them\n\nso seriously the questions I asked you you don't have to answer to me but answer them to yourself. and then ask yourself what that looks like down the line. is this someone who you can rely on to take care of you if you ever need it? has he ever taken care of you if you were sick or hurt? is that something he's willing to do for 5 minutes or a day but then not willing to do if it's anything longer? you lived with him for 3 years, dated him longer - do you see yourself in this relationship in 5 years? 10 years? are you imagining having kids with him?\n\nI've got little cousins who are less than 5 years old who try to clean up around the house and be helpful and they generally only stuff their socks in the sofa if they're having a meltdown (or are in that period of time where they think stuffing stuff in the sofa is hilarious and magical)\n\nanyway you don't have to answer these questions to me and they're mostly just to get you to think about the relationship, but my overall takeaway is that you're not an asshole for the stunt with the dogs.... but you are kind of being the asshole to yourself. it sounds like you have expected a position as this man's maid. a position that you don't seem to want. a position that he doesn't seem to appreciate you have still for him\n\nbut seriously ask yourself these questions.", "This is the way.
