You appear to think anything else is too long and narcissistic.\n\n**Edit 3:** You admit to calling her the R-word. You then state you think you can do that because you're autistic and you're \"reclaiming\" it. That's not what reclaiming is. Reclaiming isn't using a slur against someone as a slur to insult them. That's straight up using a slur on them. There's no fancy dancing around that. I say that as an autistic person myself. Nobody is ever allowed to use that word on me. If they wanna call themselves that, fine. But me? No. That's disrespectful.\n\n**Edit 4:** And now you've called someone in the comments the R-word.\n\n**You are the problem.**", "Reading the post, I figured, this woman sounds pretty bad.

She absolutely will not shut up about her job, and I do not care to hear about it because her voice is basically a trigger at this point. But she has obvious NPD and needs to talk about her day for whatever reason.\n\nHer thing is that she sees being a cashier as this super noble thing. And she will go into great detail about her day. Whether it be a customer complaining about her, or her bragging about how she arranged a place to stay at a shelter for a homeless man, I hear about everything. Which is amazing because she refuses to gossip about her coworkers, but she still finds some way to not shut up about work, and how her job helps the homeless, etc. Her company is also literally a cult, by the way.\n\nToday, it was about how a customer took offense to her saying black skin ages well and reported her to her boss. Which I get, because that is just an incredibly weird thing to talk about at workjl. And later in her day, a homeless man came in asking for help paying for a hotel room. She was able to get him approved for a bed at the rescue mission. I mean, good for her, but why brag about it?\n\nI interrupted her and told her that her complex was getting annoying. I explained that she views herself as this incredibly important person and a gift to the world, when literally all she does is push buttons on a touch screen and puts things in a bag. (She is kicking me out for a stupid reason and I legally have 30 days so I will enjoy spending this time clapping back at her.) She said, \"Not that you even want to get a job, but you absolutely would not last a day doing the work I do.\" I pointed out she is kicking me out, so I have no idea how she expects me to get a job. She said, \"True. You just want everything handed to you for free.\" I told her to quit talking to me, and she said, \"Oh so your boundaries matter and not mine.\" And she promptly disconnected me from the wifi like a petty child.
