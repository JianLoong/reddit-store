I have a lot of issues I battle with on the daily, and  one of those without getting soapbox-y is how I come off to people. I  would much rather maintain the peace instead of stoke the flames of  drama. As a sort of thank you, I just wanted to give everyone a very  quick wrap up.\n\nWe are nearing two  weeks now since the incident (11 days from posting, the few days after  where he didn't re-appear), so it's pretty safe to say he got the  message. Here is what happened since then, and hopefully some of this  can help others who encounter a similar situation:\n\n* I have placed a \"do not feed the animals\" sign up facing the foot traffic area. I decided it would be good to have as an additional deterrent.\n* The ground is too cold now, and too temperamental at the moment, but once it starts to get warmer we will be installing metal slates to go inside our fencing to deter interaction.\n* I  spoke with the neighborhood, two families mentioned they know who he  is, that he lives alone and they had to tell him to not do that either  but only after threatening the cops did he stop (similar to me). I also  asked if they believed him to have some form of dementia or other memory  impairing disease. One of the men spoke up saying he talks to him  literally every other week or so when he comes in to his shop to ask  questions. They have full conversations, and he, quote, \"has one of the  sharpest memories he ever seen, that he even remembers things I don't  remember.\"\n* Cops  were notified regardless. I told them I don't expect any more trouble,  and that they were told about him from someone else a few months ago so  that if I see him again to just call it in. Probably one of the families  I talked to.\n* Puppies  aren't too happy with me since they don't get their sporadic daily  treats from strangers, but thems the haps (and their stomachs will thank  me for it, much to the dismay of my slippers).\n\nThat's  it really. I know it's not super eventful or anything, but that's  basically where we are now. I think this is as wrapped up as it can be.  Here's to hoping the sign does it's job better than my words for anyone  else in the future.\n\nYa'll have a good rest of the evening, stay warm!", "created_utc": 1676228259, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110n9gu/update_regarding_the_elderly_man_feeding_my_dogs/", "score": 445, "replies": ["I would ask the guy he talks to if he discusses current things or past things.  It's very common in dementia to have sharp older memories.  It's the recent ones that are lost.  You can get the odd behaviors and difficulty understanding before the rest is noticeable.  It could also be a form of mental illness.\n\nIn any case, I'm glad things have improved.", "In some countries eg switzerland it\u2019s even forbidden by law to feed other people\u2019s pet without their approval.", "Being able to pet a strangers puppy (without even asking if it\u2019s ok no less) should be plenty. Absolutely no reason to feed them anything unless the owner OKs it &/or gives you the treat to feed them. You don\u2019t know their diet, their needs, and they\u2019re not your dog no matter how friendly. You don\u2019t know what they are or are not being trained to do and you could be massively screwing that up by doing this.\n\nGood on you OP for taking care of your puppies. It\u2019s more than reasonable, sensitive tummies or not, to not want people to feed your dogs. \n\nI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll adjust in quick time to the new (safer) routine.", "You could at least include a photo! You can't talk about puppies then not show us said puppies!", "Thanks for the update! I always enjoy reading them.\n\nI read yr orig post and would've put NTA. You told the man several times nicely not to feed treats, so I think you can be excused for losing your temper.\n\nWild to read that he's been doing it to others as well! Clearly, if he wants to do something, he's going to ignore people if they ask him to stop it.", "> \"has one of the sharpest memories he ever seen, that he even remembers things I don't remember.\"\n\nWhere I come from, that's a euphemism for \"has a wild imagination and vivid hallucinations.\"", "No pet tax?????", ">and their stomachs will thank me for it, much to the dismay of my slippers\n\nThat sounds adorable.

You did well protecting your pups. The fact that he's sharp and doesn't stop until threatened with the cops goes to show you that he thinks he's right and has the right, no matter what you say.

I had my dog at a pet friendly bar, and I caught a guy from a couple of tables over sliding treats to him. He was being sneaky, so he knew it wasn\u2019t ok.
