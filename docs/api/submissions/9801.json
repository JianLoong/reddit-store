I have a lot of issues I battle with on the daily, and  one of those without getting soapbox-y is how I come off to people. I  would much rather maintain the peace instead of stoke the flames of  drama. As a sort of thank you, I just wanted to give everyone a very  quick wrap up.\n\nWe are nearing two  weeks now since the incident (11 days from posting, the few days after  where he didn't re-appear), so it's pretty safe to say he got the  message. Here is what happened since then, and hopefully some of this  can help others who encounter a similar situation:\n\n* I have placed a \"do not feed the animals\" sign up facing the foot traffic area. I decided it would be good to have as an additional deterrent.\n* The ground is too cold now, and too temperamental at the moment, but once it starts to get warmer we will be installing metal slates to go inside our fencing to deter interaction.\n* I  spoke with the neighborhood, two families mentioned they know who he  is, that he lives alone and they had to tell him to not do that either  but only after threatening the cops did he stop (similar to me). I also  asked if they believed him to have some form of dementia or other memory  impairing disease. One of the men spoke up saying he talks to him  literally every other week or so when he comes in to his shop to ask  questions. They have full conversations, and he, quote, \"has one of the  sharpest memories he ever seen, that he even remembers things I don't  remember.\"\n* Cops  were notified regardless. I told them I don't expect any more trouble,  and that they were told about him from someone else a few months ago so  that if I see him again to just call it in. Probably one of the families  I talked to.\n* Puppies  aren't too happy with me since they don't get their sporadic daily  treats from strangers, but thems the haps (and their stomachs will thank  me for it, much to the dismay of my slippers).\n\nThat's  it really. I know it's not super eventful or anything, but that's  basically where we are now. I think this is as wrapped up as it can be.  Here's to hoping the sign does it's job better than my words for anyone  else in the future.\n\nYa'll have a good rest of the evening, stay warm!", "created_utc": 1676228259, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110n9gu/update_regarding_the_elderly_man_feeding_my_dogs/", "score": 811, "replies": ["I would ask the guy he talks to if he discusses current things or past things.  It's very common in dementia to have sharp older memories.  It's the recent ones that are lost.  You can get the odd behaviors and difficulty understanding before the rest is noticeable.  It could also be a form of mental illness.\n\nIn any case, I'm glad things have improved.", "In some countries eg switzerland it\u2019s even forbidden by law to feed other people\u2019s pet without their approval.", "Being able to pet a strangers puppy (without even asking if it\u2019s ok no less) should be plenty. Absolutely no reason to feed them anything unless the owner OKs it &/or gives you the treat to feed them. You don\u2019t know their diet, their needs, and they\u2019re not your dog no matter how friendly. You don\u2019t know what they are or are not being trained to do and you could be massively screwing that up by doing this.\n\nGood on you OP for taking care of your puppies. It\u2019s more than reasonable, sensitive tummies or not, to not want people to feed your dogs. \n\nI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll adjust in quick time to the new (safer) routine.", "You could at least include a photo! You can't talk about puppies then not show us said puppies!", "Thanks for the update! I always enjoy reading them.\n\nI read yr orig post and would've put NTA. You told the man several times nicely not to feed treats, so I think you can be excused for losing your temper.\n\nWild to read that he's been doing it to others as well! Clearly, if he wants to do something, he's going to ignore people if they ask him to stop it.", "> \"has one of the sharpest memories he ever seen, that he even remembers things I don't remember.\"\n\nWhere I come from, that's a euphemism for \"has a wild imagination and vivid hallucinations.\"", "No pet tax?????", ">and their stomachs will thank me for it, much to the dismay of my slippers\n\nThat sounds adorable. Did you pay the puppy tax yet??", "When I was younger there was a man in my neighborhood who could recite all manner of plays and poems without hesitation, but couldn't tell the gas and brake pedal apart on his car. Aging does some weird things to the brain.", "My mother was slipping into dementia but she managed to fool Adult Protective Services a couple of times. You\u2019d think they\u2019d be trained on how to detect this type of deception.", "Yup, my dad has dementia and all the old memories are there, but if you ask about anything today or even yesterday, he won't know :(", "Pup tax!", "The real issue with feeding others' animals is, they get used to taking from anyone and someone with bad intentions can give them something to make them ill, or, worse! \n\nTime for OP to teach them to \"leave it!\" and only take his treats. I hate when others interject when I am training my animals. It confuses their training.", "I'm nice two times. After that I'm very direct. After that I'm rude.", "Thanks for the update. You did well protecting your pups. The fact that he's sharp and doesn't stop until threatened with the cops goes to show you that he thinks he's right and has the right, no matter what you say. Give extra belly rubs for me.", "Thou. Hast. Sinned. \n\nWhere. Art. Thou. PUPPY TAX.", "Wow, you\u2019re the puppy nazi. NO PUP FOR YOU!", "He seems to have no problems remembering not to feed other peoples dogs after being threatened with police intervention.\n\nI don't think this is a memory issue. I think it's an entitlement issue.", "And they are but as I'm sure you know very well, many times you can only see the early signs of dementia by living with them or watching them daily.", "Some dogs have special diets. I had my dog at a pet friendly bar, and I caught a guy from a couple of tables over sliding treats to him. He was being sneaky, so he knew it wasn\u2019t ok. When I intercepted one and slid it back, he smirked and shrugged his shoulders. I said rather loudly \u201cyou think it\u2019s funny to sneak treats  to a diabetic dog, asshole?\u201d He left pretty quickly.", "I hardly ever saw her. It was obvious over the phone and from what her boyfriend was telling us. APS really dropped the ball since we were trying to get her to accept help.", "I'm glad this seems to have resolved for you. I know your frustration.\n\nWe have a cat lady who walks the neighborhood and leaves food/treats for them. Seems harmless (maybe not so harmless after reading all the comments about poisoning!) and I know she means well, but it's become a real nuisance. The cats she's trying to attract belong to people. I don't agree with letting cats outside, but I don't agree with trying to lure someone's pet away either. One of the neighbors had hers disappear for months. He was only returned when she offered a reward. The one the cat lady tried to feed today actually belongs to our longtime friends/neighbors two doors up, and is obviously not a stray. She does not need the help, her round belly is a dead giveaway. She would also go with anyone. It is easy to tell a stray cat from a kept, cared for cat, so this infuriates me.\n\nShe insisted on trying to feed a feral we've been working with for a year. The thing is, he has bad teeth and can't eat hard food, so the skunks were eating it instead. And she continued to scare him by approaching him despite his obvious fear, setting him back in our progress in earning his trust. I had to put *several* sets of signs up asking her to stop. (Thankfully, we now have him inside and are working on his medical issues, so she can't do this anymore with him.)\n\nI know some people really do mean well and think they're helping, but when someone asks you to stop, don't assume you know better than they do and continue to do it anyway.", "Hi pet tax please", "I\u2019m glad this situation appears to be resolved. I have two dogs who need to eat a special diet because they have a genetic condition that causes seizures if they eat food with gluten in it. Because my dogs are very cute, people sometimes try to give them treats, but I have now gotten everyone I know to stop by telling them (briefly) about this disorder. If they avoid gluten, no seizures! \n\nI would never give someone else\u2019s dog any type of food or treat unless they specifically asked me to do so.", "Yeah I would NEVER feed someone's dog unless they gave me the food themselves and told me to. Honestly I'm usually happy not even getting to pat them, I love just seeing dogs going about their day. if there were small gaps in a fence I walked by regularly I'd be careful in case of territorialness too, eventually once they proved not actively aggressive I might progress to letting them sniff my fingers but that's about it.", "The fact that the man could remember 'there are puppies' and 'bring treats' and finally 'OP is a mean man who shouted at me and I don't feel safe so I will alter my walking path' makes me think he does not have cognitive impairment.", "This. \n\nWhere I am from, it is unfortunately pretty common for dogs to be poisoned. We\u2019ve lost a dog and a number of friends or neighbours have lost (in one case nearly lost) a dog to a potential home invader. Even after I moved overseas, I\u2019m still careful. \n\nFor years now, our dogs are taught not to take food from people who don\u2019t know the pattern, and not to eat off the ground. People get very defensive and judgemental because you won\u2019t let them \u201cspoil\u201d your dog. But, after seeing what can happen, those people can take a long walk off a short pier as far as I\u2019m concerned. \n\nIt also has the added benefit of teaching your dog not to snatch food. So a big plus with big breeds.", "Yeah, my grandpa could tell me certain poems and stories perfectly, word for word- but called my brother Thurman (his name is not Thurman), thought my grandma was still alive, terrorized his nursing home roommates\u2026the human brain is scary in its complexity and aging is just downright scary sometimes.", "Pup tax!! Pup tax!!", "Yes, that as well. Which is why they should be taught only to accept foods from certain people, as part of their training.", "We had a neighbor who did this and we have very large dogs so we didn\u2019t want her to be scared of them and it was a good way for her to not be afraid of them so we just bought her treats that we wanted the dogs to have.", "to be fair. \n\na dog trainer once gave me an advice regarding a neighbor's loud barking dog. \n\nhe said, \"go feed their dog treats\" \n\nbecause then the dog starts seeing the people on the other side of the fence, specifically me, as friendly, and stops barking. \n\nalso the situation is a lot safer for you when you can control the other guy's large dog because you trained him."]}
