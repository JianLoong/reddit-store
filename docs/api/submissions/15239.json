Her friend is moving out of the country, so they were hanging out at our place first, drinking mimosas and listening to music, and after that they went out to drink at a bar. I am injured (recently had surgery), am taking antibiotics, can\u2019t drink or move around easily, and so I stayed at home with the dog. \n\nThe dog is relevant to the story; he is a male dog, and he is kinda sceptical towards other male dogs. It\u2019s about a 50/50 chance whether he will like them or not.\n\nAt around 4am, my wife comes home with one of her friend and two people they met at a bar. Turns out, one of those people brought their male dog. It was a cute dog, he seemed really nice. But it was a male dog. \n\nOur dog jumped down, eager to greet his mom, then sees the other dog and *freaks out*. I have to lift him up to avoid a dog fight, and when the other dog goes over to eat his food, he freaks out even more, barking and growling.\n\nIn my sleepy state I probably overreacted; I ask my wife why the hell she thought it was okay to bring a male dog home at 4am, and while he is freaking out in my arms, basically begging me to let him down so he can eviscerate the \u201cintruder\u201d, I tell them to get out of my home, and basically push them out the door.\n\nMy wife then brings some wine outside to have a drink with her friends in the backyard, and I bring the dog into the bedroom to calm him down.\n\nAn hour or so later she comes back inside and goes to bed. \n\nThe next morning she tells me her friends were \u201cworried about her\u201d after my reaction, and that the dogs would have been fine (my dog was *literally* snarling at the other dog while I was holding him). I will admit that I might have overreacted in my exhausted state at 4am, but AITA?\n\nEdit: Spelling", "created_utc": 1681987146, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12su6gf/aita_for_throwing_out_my_wifes_friends_at_4am/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wife knows you are in recovery and knows the dog and yet still brings these people into the house at 4 am with their dog. She was incredibly inconsiderate and lacking in empathy.

I'm on your dog's side. My dear old girl had a strict rule about other female dogs on her turf. It's your dog's home and food. Of course he'd be reactionary.", "NTA.   Your wife brings home people she met at a bar?  At 4am?", "NTA\n\nI guess you can think you overreacted but if your wife knows your own dog doesnt like other Male dogs then she is just in the wrong", "I had to take my dads wife to the emergency room, three bites, 9 stitches. She accidentally got between her two dogs, one of which is food aggressive.\n\nYea, you might have dodged a bullet, it might have been nothing?

You saved the other dog from being mauled in front of everyone -you never mentioned the size of your dog, but even a small dog can do damage if they get the first attack in. They were drunk, not thinking, not fully *recognizing* reality in front of them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn another, semi-related note... this is exactly why the \"Oh don't worry, he's friendly!\" thought process is flat-out wrong, and dangerous. *Your* dog may be friendly, sir/ma'am, but do you know if the other dog is?", "NTA No one brought up the fact that he just had surgery. He could have injured himself trying to separate fighting dogs. Once the other dog started eating his dog\u2019s food, all hell would have broken loose. I can understand his wife staying out late with her friend, and coming home for another cocktail. But who brings people from a bar to your home with a dog at 4:00am, especially when your husband is in bed recovering? Were they even her friends or just some people she met at the bar?", "NTA - I love that you\u2019re sticking up for your wife in the comments. It was a moment of poor impulsive decision making on her part, I\u2019m glad that everything ended up okay in the end - I\u2019m sure that she\u2019s sticking up for you to her friends after realizing that she made a bit of a judgement error!", "NTA. Everyone is talking about the dog, but no one is talking about the fact that your wife brought home 2 strangers that she had just met in a bar. They could have been serial killers. Cannibals. Maybe the dog was so hungry because they hadn\u2019t killed anyone recently. Who brings complete strangers to their home at 4 in the morning?", "NTA. They were clearly tanked if they thought their dog would be ok", "NTA you safe yourself from potentially having to pay vet bills etc...", "NTA\nShe is inconsiderate.

Your wife showed really poor judgment bringing home people she met at a bar?  At 4AM?  With a dog she didn't know?  And continued drinking?\n\nThis really isn't normal adult behaviour.  And they were worried about her?", "ESH\n\nYour wife should've known better, but your reaction is a bit concerning if her friends were literally \"worried about her\". It being 4 AM isn't really an excuse. You could have defused the situation without being so aggressive that your wife's friends worried about how you treat her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Her friend is leaving the country for an extended period of time, so they just wanted to have one night out together before she left.

And it\u2019s not like this is a common occurrence, you know? She apologised, we\u2019re all good. I was just worried that I might have overreacted.

Just limping a bit and still on antibiotics (thus the no alcohol for me part).", "I mean this isn\u2019t a regular occurrence or anything, her friend is leaving the country indefinitely and they wanted one night of fun before she did.

This was in his home.\n\nIn her defence she thought they could just bring the other dog out on the balcony so that my dog wouldn\u2019t even see him, but he was already at the door to greet her.", "She rarely drinks, this was just one last hoorah for a friend who is leaving for possibly many years.\n\nBut thank you, seems like most people here agree with you.", "Nah, she is basically never out with her friends. And with her friend leaving the country for an extended period of time, I think having a night out on the town with her friend before she leaves is perfectly warranted.\n\nThe issue for me was bringing a male dog when she knows how he reacts.", "Thank you. They are both small dogs, but mine is a dachshund. The other one was some sort of small curly fluffball. If there was a fight, it would be a short one.\n\nMy dog is usually very friendly, but the combination of it being a male dog that he didn\u2019t know, and it being _his house_ made him immediately go into defense mode.", "One friend, two people she met at the bar.\n\nI mean it\u2019s been a couple of weeks since the surgery, but I am limping a bit still and I am on antibiotics (thus no drinking). \n\nI was fine with her bringing people over, I just thought they should have left their dog at home.", "She apologised, so we\u2019re all good! I don\u2019t care that she was out with her friends or brought people over, I was just upset at the unknown dog.\n\nThe reason I was thinking I could be TA is that I could have told them to pick up the other dog and keep him on the balcony with the door closed instead of throwing them out.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 That comment cracked me up, thank you! \n\nI was never worried about that part, even post surgery I am pretty capable.

Idk.", "I mean\u2026 Never? Her friend is leaving the country for an indefinite period of time, and they wanted to have one night out together before she left.

I just wanted to know if I overreacted.", "I get that, and thank you for your honesty (I upvoted you!). I mean I don\u2019t really understand why they would be worried, it\u2019s not like I was yelling at her. I basically said \u201cYou know how he is around other male dogs, why did you let them bring a dog he doesn\u2019t know?\u201d and told them to \u201cget out!\u201d while I was holding a snarling dog in my arms.\n\nBut I understand that my reaction might have been over the top, thus the post.", "That would make a big mess though.

Seems most people here agree with you!", "Just so I\u2019m clear... you\u2019re upset because your wife\u2019s friend\u2019s dog upset your dog? That just seems like the cherry on top of an all-around bad decision sundae \n\nNothing bad happened to the dogs. Your dog is a male... if I had to guess he\u2019s probably still intact. It\u2019s a pretty standard reaction from intact males. Regardless... It\u2019s was just a bad scenario, 4 am, strangers, strange male dog, Dad is freaking out. Your dog is fine... He\u2019s probably already over it. So I guess it\u2019s all good. Ask her not to do it again. Who cares what her friends think about you throwing them out .... they think it\u2019s okay to walk in people\u2019s homes with their dog at 4 am so....", "Were those 2 people men?", "Yeah the thing I was upset about was bringing the male dog. My dog was super angry, and tried to attack the other dog (I picked him up before that happened), and kept snarling and barking at the other dog while I held him, which is why I told them to get out.", "They were a couple, f/m."]}
