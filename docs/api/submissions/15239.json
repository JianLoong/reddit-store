{"id": 15239, "submission_id": "12su6gf", "title": "AITA for throwing out my wife\u2019s friends at 4am?", "selftext": "My (41m) wife (40F) was out with her friends last night. Her friend is moving out of the country, so they were hanging out at our place first, drinking mimosas and listening to music, and after that they went out to drink at a bar. I am injured (recently had surgery), am taking antibiotics, can\u2019t drink or move around easily, and so I stayed at home with the dog. \n\nThe dog is relevant to the story; he is a male dog, and he is kinda sceptical towards other male dogs. It\u2019s about a 50/50 chance whether he will like them or not.\n\nAt around 4am, my wife comes home with one of her friend and two people they met at a bar. Turns out, one of those people brought their male dog. It was a cute dog, he seemed really nice. But it was a male dog. \n\nOur dog jumped down, eager to greet his mom, then sees the other dog and *freaks out*. I have to lift him up to avoid a dog fight, and when the other dog goes over to eat his food, he freaks out even more, barking and growling.\n\nIn my sleepy state I probably overreacted; I ask my wife why the hell she thought it was okay to bring a male dog home at 4am, and while he is freaking out in my arms, basically begging me to let him down so he can eviscerate the \u201cintruder\u201d, I tell them to get out of my home, and basically push them out the door.\n\nMy wife then brings some wine outside to have a drink with her friends in the backyard, and I bring the dog into the bedroom to calm him down.\n\nAn hour or so later she comes back inside and goes to bed. \n\nThe next morning she tells me her friends were \u201cworried about her\u201d after my reaction, and that the dogs would have been fine (my dog was *literally* snarling at the other dog while I was holding him). I will admit that I might have overreacted in my exhausted state at 4am, but AITA?\n\nEdit: Spelling\n\nEdit 2: Since so many people asked: They were at a dog friendly bar, so the people actually brought their dog to the bar. When I get better I\u2019m definitely going there _with_ the dog one day!\n\nEdit 3: A lot of people are reacting to the part about bringing home strangers. Where I live, going home with or bringing home new acquaintances for a night cap is a completely normal thing to do, so I didn\u2019t even consider that being a point of contention, which is why I didn\u2019t address it in the original text.\n\nEdit 4: My dog is not dog aggressive outside of my home. He is a dachshund, so he is territorial, but he does not attack dogs outside. He is perfectly fine in dog parks, and in dog bars. When I say he is 50/50 on whether or not he likes other male dogs, that does not mean he attacks them - it means he does a double bark and then backs away. \n\nThis was in his home, unprepared, and the other dog was eating his food. Knowing the breed, plus him being sceptical of male dogs, means that his reaction was _predictable_. It does NOT mean he is dog aggressive (or food aggressive for that matter - when dogs he knows eats his food he does not care one bit) in general.", "created_utc": 1681987146, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12su6gf/aita_for_throwing_out_my_wifes_friends_at_4am/", "score": 1460, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wife could have been more cognizant of the male dog problem, but she spent the evening getting tuned up and probably emotional with her friend leaving for x time.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t really seem like there was even a serious problem that resulted from her lack of judgement on the dog situation.  \n\nI think you already knew you were NTA though, so I\u2019m confused about the intention of the post.

No, bars in my municipality close at 2am.  It would be normal to see someone out with their dog at 2am, and normal to see a dog at an after party at 4am, however.\n\nThe general rule here is that patios are fine.

So much so that we've got a whole canned line for OP missing the real issue.", "I don't doubt that mate I'm entirely on your side\n\nI think your wife messed up on the dog but that doesn't make her a bad person like some are making out", "Fingers crossed. \n\nAnd, I'm sure Mrs. uglybobby is delightful. \n\nI'm just a frustrated scriptwriter looking for an axe to grind. lol.", "I see yeah I don\u2019t want you to give away details like that  anyways should\u2019ve worded it a bit better but I guess that makes sense. Where I live most bars are pretty much 24 hours or are open until around the same time you mentioned. Thanks for answering my question though I appreciate that it seems a lot of people where like me and hung up more on the people than the dog so it was just a bit confusing.", "No that\u2019s exactly what my train of thought was is she brought her drunk self home with 2 new people that could do anything rob, kill,r@pe you name it that\u2019s why no one leaves there house unlocked anymore higher population the more crazies you get.", "This is the correct answer", "Thanks for your consideration - he is a small dog (less than 10lbs), so lifting him was not an issue.", ">I mean, I think it's odd that you don't mind your wife bringing strangers home at 4 a.m...doesn't anybody work? Don't you sleep? But hey, not my circus...\n\nPretty normal thing for my friends and me. After parties will go until sunrise and a lot of people will drink through the next day. I'm too old for that these days but that was a common occurrence for many years of my life. (obviously drugs are involved)", "Dogs are territorial. This dog was eating his food. He is fine in dog parks, if there are dogs he doesn\u2019t like he barks at them and leaves.", "That\u2019s exactly my point. The issue people are mad about, op has no problem with. He seems like a good dude who loves his wife and is obviously not getting the reception he expected.", "She is! Best of luck with your writing!", "Yeah I have had to clear that up a lot. Maybe I should make an edit.", "And obviously I\u2019ll just say it Your NTA", "Your behavior and choice to hold the dog caused the dog to be more aggressive.\n10lb dogs are not purses...your actions incourages aggressive behavior. Put the dog down and in the bedroom. Take your to dog training.", "Same where I live... Didn't realise it's so rare until I saw all the ranting here..", "Must not be American lol here you get shot going to stranger's homes....", "It\u2019s one of the things I love about pubs.  I am pretty introverted and shy, but pups are always a welcome sight, and sometimes they help break the ice so that I am not so awkward around their humans.", "Might not be a bad idea to make it know it was the dog and not the people but I think either way you\u2019ll be seen as NTA because most of this sub is North American and like I said before when you live with a spouse or your parents it\u2019s a No-no to bring people over at that time unless stated before or an emergency.", "I get that reading a short snippet doesn\u2019t accurately convey the situation, but let me assure you right now that I know perfectly well how to train a dog and that the issue was not me holding the dog. Thanks.", "Man, I am not sure why all these people are terribly upset and pearl clutching about you and your wife having a social life that is not strictly ordered. \"Strangers? Alcohol? Am? Not on my watch!\" \n\nI wouldn't bat an eyelid if my partner brought friends over, especially in such a scenario, and we both work. \n\nBut to be honest, OP, her friends were right. I would never accept my partner screaming at me in front of others. It's humiliating and it is worrying - if you scream at her in front of others, what happens if you are alone? Pretty sure the weird hour got to your head, but it's understandable she's upset.", "That's just not true. I've gone to many strangers houses after leaving the bar, and I've done it all across the US.", "It speaks to my American-ness that I cannot *fathom* inviting a complete stranger *and their dog* back to my home where my spouse is asleep at *four in the morning.* \n\nLike, this is not even a thought that would ever cross my mind. It stuns me that there are places where this would be common.", "I have added that information now to make it clearer, thanks \ud83d\ude0a"]}
