Her friend is moving out of the country, so they were hanging out at our place first, drinking mimosas and listening to music, and after that they went out to drink at a bar. I am injured (recently had surgery), am taking antibiotics, can\u2019t drink or move around easily, and so I stayed at home with the dog. \n\nThe dog is relevant to the story; he is a male dog, and he is kinda sceptical towards other male dogs. It\u2019s about a 50/50 chance whether he will like them or not.\n\nAt around 4am, my wife comes home with one of her friend and two people they met at a bar. Turns out, one of those people brought their male dog. It was a cute dog, he seemed really nice. But it was a male dog. \n\nOur dog jumped down, eager to greet his mom, then sees the other dog and *freaks out*. I have to lift him up to avoid a dog fight, and when the other dog goes over to eat his food, he freaks out even more, barking and growling.\n\nIn my sleepy state I probably overreacted; I ask my wife why the hell she thought it was okay to bring a male dog home at 4am, and while he is freaking out in my arms, basically begging me to let him down so he can eviscerate the \u201cintruder\u201d, I tell them to get out of my home, and basically push them out the door.\n\nMy wife then brings some wine outside to have a drink with her friends in the backyard, and I bring the dog into the bedroom to calm him down.\n\nAn hour or so later she comes back inside and goes to bed. \n\nThe next morning she tells me her friends were \u201cworried about her\u201d after my reaction, and that the dogs would have been fine (my dog was *literally* snarling at the other dog while I was holding him). I will admit that I might have overreacted in my exhausted state at 4am, but AITA?\n\nEdit: Spelling\n\nEdit 2: Since so many people asked: They were at a dog friendly bar, so the people actually brought their dog to the bar.

You're in recovery and by all reasonable expectations would've already been asleep so inviting them all back was just generally inconsiderate, previously known or not. \n\nNTA at all.

Your wife could have been more cognizant of the male dog problem, but she spent the evening getting tuned up and probably emotional with her friend leaving for x time.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t really seem like there was even a serious problem that resulted from her lack of judgement on the dog situation.  \n\nI think you already knew you were NTA though, so I\u2019m confused about the intention of the post.

Where I live it is very much not allowed, even with outdoor seating, to bring an animal, besides a registered service animal to an eating/drinking establishment. A lot of places put water bowls out for passing pups though, and sometimes have treats the servers keep to hand out if they are near when you walk  passed, which is sweet of them.", "Where I live?  No, bars in my municipality close at 2am.  It would be normal to see someone out with their dog at 2am, and normal to see a dog at an after party at 4am, however.\n\nThe general rule here is that patios are fine.  I also know of several bars (ones without a license requiring food sales) that allow dogs inside.  \n\nIt is completely common.", "Our bars aren\u2019t even open that late, I\u2019m in a CA beach community but sure there are dogs everywhere all the time.

I could understand her bringing her friend back for another drink. They won't see each other for awhile. I get it. Bringing home 2 unknown people at 4am? That is not normal or ok. It's downright dangerous. You're being incredibly naive thinking that part is not an issue.. This could have ended a lot worse.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like you are your wife are fine now, but I do have to say bringing two complete strangers into your house at 4am is SUPER weird. \n\nBut you seem cool with it so no harm done.
