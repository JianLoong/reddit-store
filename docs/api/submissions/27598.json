It's something you take on because you want to provide a loving home environment for a child whose own family can't or doesn't want to raise them. It's not something you take on simply because \"babies are too much time and money\". Wtf.", "NTA\n\n> I could have just said I didn\u2019t want children and leave it at that\n\n#YOU \\*DID\\*!!\n\n> she asked why, I said because I don\u2019t, she asked why again, this cycle continued for a couple minutes before I just had enough.", "NTA, but that doesn't mean what you said didn't hurt. Not your fault or even what you meant. But it's tough not having money, and sometimes you second guess if having kids was the right call, then you feel guilty for even thinking that. You touched a nerve and didn't realize it.\n\nI would apologize and move on. You're not apologizing for what you said so much as not considering her feelings. Had you known that it would cut so deep, you probably would have picked your words more carefully.\n\nSome hills are worth dying on, this isn't one of them.", "NTA If Jazz didn't like the answer then she should've thought twice about asking the question.", "You did not attack her or her lifestyle. You gave her your honest reason. Your answer hit a nerve in her. That is her issue.  She also would not stop asking why you don't want children and would not accept the \" I didn't want children\" answer.  Someone ask who harasses a 21 yr old to have kids- my exMIL, and every old lady at my former church. Aunt  was the AH. NTA.", "She continued to have kids when she should have known better...choices have consequences.  She's upset because of what she sees as your rejection of her way of life...but also, maybe a bit of jealousy.  It's possible she was hoping you'd join her misery club but you've declared you're breaking the cycle.", "You could have just said you didn't want kids and leave it at that? The way you did, over and over?\n\nPlease.\n\nSome people only learn the hard way no matter how much you try.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  It is perfectly fine to be child free.  However, even if someone wants children there are a few things you need to do before you have them.\n\n1) Get an education that will provide you with a stable source of income.  You don't have to go to college, but you need some type of training that will help you develop a solid career.\n\n2) Establish yourself in that career and build a nest egg.\n\n3) Take time to have fun and explore your interests.  This could be as a single person or as a married couple.\n\n4) If you have had a dysfunctional childhood, go to therapy and work through things so you don't repeat the cycle.\n\n5) Wisely chose your partner before you marry.  You can't just look at whether or not they meet your needs.  You have to scrutinize them to determine the kind of parent they will be.", "NTA she pushed and you gave her fair warning when you asked if she really wanted to know. You didn\u2019t attack her or her lifestyle, she pried it out of you and has come to the realization that she is not happy with her choices. Classic FAFO", "NTA you couldn\u2019t just say you don\u2019t want children because she wasn\u2019t accepting that as a answer", "NTA. She wasn\u2019t letting it go so you told her the truth. If she wanted freedom and all that maybe she should have not had kids herself, or stopped at some point before having five of them.\nI\u2019m not childfree myself (I wish I were, but damn biology has me longing for a kid someday), but I will defend childfree people until my dying day. You go girl, and screw other people\u2019s judgement.", "Jazz is an idiot. You wanted to leave it at that, but she kept pestering you. She's contradicting herself and blaming you for her own nosiness. And you didn't attack her lifestyle, you merely stated the lifestyle you want to lead, and she read into it.", "NTA. First of all, who is telling you that you HAVE to have kids at 21 nowadays?!... Secondly, you didnt say \"like you\" so if she took it personally its obvious she knows having so many kids has caused her to not have freedom or extra money. She can't get mad at you for seeing that and not wanting it for yourself. Most people who want kids are even waiting until late 20s, into their 30s to have them now because you SHOULD have a good financial base to raise them on and should have time to live your life before you have to live it for them.", "You didn't attack her or her lifestyle you made an \"I\" statement about what you wanted for your life. If she felt attacked it's only because she also wants the freedom of being child free and she is upset that she feels like she didn't have a choice.\n\nI too was raised that you grow up (Catholic) you yet married (in the Catholic Church) and you raise lots of (Catholic) babies and there wasn't another option. It was years and several miscarriages before I examined if I actually wanted kids and at that time being Child Free was a RADICAL idea. No one who was ever happy with their own family planning got angry over my choices but they were often \"sad\" for me.", "None of this is your fault.  You were diplomatic.  She pushed and pushed until you gave her the unvarnished truth.\n\nIf she's hurt about that, too goddamn bad.  That's on her, not you.\n\nYou sound a lot wiser and more self aware than any of your relatives.\n\nSo, good for you!\n\nNTA.", "Ugh. You can\u2019t call someone an A hole for a personal preference/decisions and yet choosing to actively not half children sounds so inherently selfish. \n\nSomeone gave you the gift of life but you have zero interest in paying that forward. I can\u2019t help but judge such people and think it would have been fitting if their parents had chosen not to have them in the first place as well.", ">AFTER she asked.\n\nMULTIPLE times no less.  She was the one not accepting the answer she got initially.  OP should point that out to Aunt Jazz.\n\nNTA.  How OP lives their life is their business, no one has the right to tell them they have live by someone else's standards.", "And she kept PUSHING for a straight answer, so you gave her one.", "After she pestered amd insisted on a real answer. Seems like a faafo moment.", "And asked. And asked. And asked.\n\nNTA. Don't apologize. Your body, your choice.", "As someone who had their first at 21, I completely agree actually.", "It's actually very common for women of any age to be harassed if they state they don't want children.  No reason is ever good enough for those dead set on breeding, and if you give them perfectly logical explanations for not breeding that pertain only to you personally, they take it as a slight directed against them personally.  In my own life, people felt they had a right to demand that I have children from the time I hit puberty until I reached my forties.  And I am by no means alone in that experience.", "This post may seem fake, but this scenario isn't. It's pretty common in many cultures to pester the young adults about procreation, especially collectivistic ones.", "> Who harasses a 21yo about when they're going to have kids?!\n\nMy mother in law lol. She started on us having kids when we weren't even 18 yet, then we got married young, and that whole side of the family wanted me popping them out ASAP \u0ca0_\u0ca0", "I had people I barely knew at church asking me when I was getting married already at 20 so... it depends.", "I got married at 21, and at MY wedding, a family member asked me why I was getting married if I wasn't pregnant.  People do the whack.", "This post is a dupe there was a \"I want money not kids\" the other days.\n\nThe writer's strike is over people, you can stop recycling material.", "Have you met...people? I'll agree there are some people who have enough sense/tact to not do this, but it is common enough, especially to young women, to almost hound them as to when they'll get married and then pivot to children. \n\nThere are tons of posts on subs like this with people harassing them about when they're having kids/how terrible or selfish they are for not having or wanting kids. And forget about women trying to have their tubes tied whether they've had 0 children or 6 - there's a large swath of society that are very adverse to women not wanting to be fertile. \n\nSo, if any post here seems suspect, I'd say it's yours.", "The first time I met my high school boyfriend's mother she smiled and said \"In the state of Maryland you can get married at 15 without parental consent if you're pregnant.\"", "I was 17 when my great-grandmother decided I should have a baby because she wanted to be a great-great.  Family can be crazy.", "Is there seriously that many similar stories on AITA? I really need to look over this subreddit more often.", "pretty much\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16qm6gf/aita_for_saying_i_dont_want_kids_i_want_money_at/", "I grew up in NYC and a good chunk of the high schools had day cares, this was in the 90\u2019s.
