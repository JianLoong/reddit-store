Scheduling appointments on the same day as mine. Asking me to pick her up randomly from appointments. Asking me for money. Yelling at me for not planning her baby shower correctly or taking extra time off to go to her 4+ hour appointments. It's gotten so bad that my husband is ready to not have her over at our house at all. Today she called me and yelled at me telling me that I need to be there for her more because she's pregnant and she needs help and I need to step up. I told her that I can't because I have my own appointments and things. She told me I should have thought of that before I told her I would help her out. I told her that she's pregnant not recovering from some major surgery and that she needed to stop acting entitled to my time. She got so mad at me, hung up,  and called my Mom telling her I was being unreasonable and I needed to step up. My mom said she told her that she is entirely overlooking that I too am pregnant and I have things I need to do. She said that because her baby is due first it should be the priority. My mom decided not to argue. After their conversation she called me telling me because Sara's near the end of her pregnancy I need to just let it go because there was nothing I could do but be kind and hope her hormones even out. I don't want to apologize because this is getting ridiculous. I honestly don't know if I was the A\\*\\*hole or not.

Probably expects u to serve her hand and foot while heavily pregnant too and always to put her and her baby's needs first.\n\nGoing to Ur mum was totally not ok and if u give in to her now she will be using that in future every time u say no to her unreasonable requests.

Next time she tries to scream at you and demand your time let her know that you\u2019re not the reason she got knocked up without a baby daddy. if she wants access to you or your time she needs to respect you and not treat you like dirt. Also, I would stop driving her around. I\u2019m sure she has access to a bus or Uber. If she didn\u2019t treat people so shitty. She probably would still have her family around or a man to help take care of her and her baby, that is not your fault, nor should it be your burden or responsibility. If she\u2019s like this now it\u2019s going to be 100 times worse when the baby arrives. I would also have an honest conversation with her about how she needs to put herself into your shoes because you\u2019re also pregnant and dealing with hormones. Maybe let her know that throughout this whole experience, it\u2019s making you second-guess wanting to be friends with her because she hasn\u2019t even taken an interest in your health or your babies progress. Remind her a friendship is between two people it\u2019s not all about one person. This should be a time where U2 could share this beautiful moment and be happy together and share milestones of your babies developing and growing instead, she\u2019s turning it into something that when you look back on you being pregnant, it\u2019s not gonna be a fond memory for you or your family.

Congrats on the baby! Seems like she has some anger about something else and is projecting it all on you.", "NTA. I would suggest limiting contact to well after her pregnancy.", "NTA.  This woman is not a friend.  Shes a user.  Get rid of her cuz it\u2019s only gonna get worse once the babies are here.  Also, don\u2019t give her any info re baby names, color/theme of nursery\u2026she will steal them.", "NTA\n\nyou need to cut her off now", "NTA.   \nI think her running to your mother shows that she is incredibly self centered.  She believes she is 100% in the right with this that she expected your mother to agree with her!  You need to move away from this relationship or you will end up raising her baby.  She is not a good friend.", "I really hope that once your baby is born you are able to put an end (or at least a strong boundary) to this toxic relationship. This friend is not more important than your health and that of your baby. Nta", "I'm sorry, does she pay you for gas, your time?\nNTA. I would distance yourself from her. Your baby has to be your priority no matter what, this means you need to put yourself first because if you fall apart, who will care for your baby? Certainly not your 'friend'. Please reevaluate this relationship.", "It sounds like she is panicking then and not in her right mind. I think I would be too. What other support does she have?\n\nIf and when you are speaking to her again, your first job is to impress on her the need for the most effective birth control she can find for immediately after the baby is born. This is for your sake as well as hers.", "What\u2019s holding up her driving thing is having a personal chauffeur at your beck and call to scream at and abuse in the guise of calling it hormones. Don\u2019t fall for this. You need to let this person go. She is not a real friend. I repeat, be like Elsa and let it go.", "You better cut her off, she's going to demand you babysit, driver her everywhere and the baby, demand money.  She should of thought about things.  You aren't obligated to do anything for her.", "NTA. You need to put yourself and YOUR baby first. \n\nIt sounds like Sara has become codependent on you, and it will probably get worse after she gives birth.\n\nYou should probably start setting boundaries now.", "NTA but be prepared for her to keep dropping off her child at your house and demanding that you babysit. Feel free to say no. I think she's mad that she's not the only one pregnant so she's making you do all this stuff to ensure the spotlight stays on her.", "NTA. Learn to say NO a lot more. Once the baby's our, you're going to be her babysitter so she can have free time.  She'll also want you to pay for a lot of stuff. \n\nThis is not a good friendship anymore for you I'm afraid.", "NTA. Boundaries are needed with her to let her know you also need to take care of yourself (and your growing baby). \n\nYou can let her know that you\u2019re not available for 4 hour appointments, or that you can only assist her x times per week. \n\nShe\u2019s treating you like a personal assistant but without pay. This isn\u2019t a friendship especially when she calls your mom to whine about you. Ugh. She\u2019s an adult and can also look to others like her baby daddy or her family to give her support.", "NTA. You\u2019re correct-your friend is NOT entitled to such a large portion of your time. She needs to find other help because you need to take care of yourself too. Too much stress is not good for you or the baby. \nGood luck \ud83c\udf40", "NTA and she isn't your friend.", "NTA. Your friend has entitlement issues, and doesnt seem to really care about what youre going through. I understand the hormones raging through her system and other discomfort that pregnancy can bring, but the fact that she doesnt seem to have ever apaologised for her behaviour, or is even aware of it is quite something.", "NTA. It may be time for this friendship to end. You don\u2019t owe her a damn thing. Period. You owe it to yourself and your baby to take care of yourself.  Set boundaries with Sara, tell her one more abusive entitled event from her, and she is in her own.  And stick to it.  If your mother has a problem with it, she can become Sara\u2019s personal slave.", "Why did she get pregnant if she couldn't handle it herself?? You're married so have your own household and family to handle anyway. What was she thinking??", "This won\u2019t end when the pregnancy ends, you know that, don\u2019t you? You need some serious boundaries, NOW. She doesn\u2019t get to ignore your needs and demand that you ignore them too. She\u2019s going to expect the same level of help once the baby arrives.", "guess he should have taken precautions then, he should know by now what causes pregnancy.  ffs, why do women keep sleeping with these dudes?  life is hard, i feel bad for the kid, but none of that is an excuse for her to treat you the way she has been.  time for a hard discussion with her calling her out and setting some firm boundaries.  if you don't do that i'm guessing she will expect you to raise her child for her too.  fuck that noise.", "THIS! Sara is acting incredibly entitled and does not get to decide what OP does with her time, whether OP was pregnant or not. I'm not pregnant and I wouldn't have time for most of the stuff listed in this post."]}
