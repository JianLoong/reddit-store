In july Sara found out she was pregnant and I was over the moon. She's always wanted to be a mom and I was really ready to step up and help her out. However, I hadn't counted on getting pregnant myself only a few month later. Since she found out I was pregnant she had done everything in her power to make sure I put her first. Scheduling appointments on the same day as mine. Asking me to pick her up randomly from appointments. Asking me for money. Yelling at me for not planning her baby shower correctly or taking extra time off to go to her 4+ hour appointments. It's gotten so bad that my husband is ready to not have her over at our house at all. Today she called me and yelled at me telling me that I need to be there for her more because she's pregnant and she needs help and I need to step up. I told her that I can't because I have my own appointments and things. She told me I should have thought of that before I told her I would help her out. I told her that she's pregnant not recovering from some major surgery and that she needed to stop acting entitled to my time. She got so mad at me, hung up,  and called my Mom telling her I was being unreasonable and I needed to step up. My mom said she told her that she is entirely overlooking that I too am pregnant and I have things I need to do. She said that because her baby is due first it should be the priority. My mom decided not to argue. After their conversation she called me telling me because Sara's near the end of her pregnancy I need to just let it go because there was nothing I could do but be kind and hope her hormones even out. I don't want to apologize because this is getting ridiculous. I honestly don't know if I was the A\\*\\*hole or not. I mean she doesn't drive and relies on me for a lot so here I am posting to reddit.

You said you would help not do everything for her.\n\nDid she even ask you how you are doing?\n\nNTA you don't owe her anything", "NTA. Sara sounds incredibly entitled and it sounds like it\u2019s time to cut her off and out of your life. If she\u2019s like this now, imagine how intolerable she\u2019ll be once she has the baby. Then HER baby will need to be the priority over yours. Don\u2019t put yourself or your future child through that.", "NTA why on earth would you be friends with somebody like that and allow yourself to ne treated that way? Tell her to do one. It with feel like a relief", "Question, did you get sara pregnant? No? NTA she has no business placing responsibility on you considering you yourself are pregnant. Where is her family in all this?", "NTA. She is being completely selfish and unhinged.  Has she even shown these tendencies before getting pregnant?", "NTA. Nothing about her behavior is okay and this is not currently a healthy friendship. Even if you weren't pregnant, her expectations of you are really unreasonable. Does she not have a partner? It seems like she has partnerified you and isn't reacting well to not being at the center of your attention and even seems to be almost punishing you for getting pregnant as well, which is again really unhealthy. I know nothing about pregnancy hormones, but this woman needs boundaries to be set and maintained.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe her anything and being pregnant isn\u2019t an excuse on being a crappy friend like the way she is behaving", "NTA. She\u2019s treating you like the child\u2019s other parent. Her needs during pregnancy are not your responsibility. Tell her you\u2019ve done as much as you can and can do no more\u2014you need to focus on YOUR pregnancy now. Don\u2019t become her free babysitter when she discovers that being a mother is hard work.", "NTA.  She needs to back off and maybe try to get help from the person who knocked her up.  Is this really a relationship you want to continue?  It is going to be one-sided forever.  What is going to happen when your baby gets here?  Are you supposed to put her child's well-being over yours?  Stop this before your baby gets here.  This is not healthy.", "I couldn\u2019t even get half way through this. She sounds awful. Why are you even friends with this person? \n\nNTA", "Good grief you are NTA. My god it\u2019s time for some serious low contact time. Do you really need this stress right now? Does your baby? Would she even care if something happened to you because you stretched yourself too thin? \n\nThe entitlement in this \u201cfriend\u201d is appalling and the fact she called your mother to tattle on you speaks volumes of her character. Hormones or not you need to put yourself and your baby first! I bet if she wasn\u2019t pregnant she wouldn\u2019t have done a fraction of what you\u2019ve already done for her.", "NTA \n\nSara is exhibiting a lot of alarming behavior, including attempting to enlist your mother as a minion.", "NTA, she isn't entitled to your time, and honestly has she even asked about how you and your baby are doing? She doesn't sound like a good friend.", "NTA.\n\nOffering to \"help out\" is not the same as offering to be her personal assistant 24/7. If she needs that much help, she should at least be spreading it around various friends and relatives.", "I\u2019m sorry, but why are you having a kid with Sara? And why are you such a bad partner and not helping her out and satisfying every whim? Why did you get her pregnant if you weren\u2019t up for the responsibility??\n\n\nOh, wait, you didn\u2019t! Tell her to not contact you ever again and that you\u2019ll file for a restraining order if she ever comes near you again. If you think I\u2019m overacting, wait until you see what she will do after she gives birth. NTA and the lady has serious issues and you don\u2019t want to give her the chance to be around your baby. NTA", "NTA.\n\nget new friends.  she isn't one", "NTA  Both of you are about to have kids.  Sara needs to figure out how to be a grown up NOW.  You don't need to provide anything for her.", "I think sometimes when we\u2019ve been friends with someone for so long, we let them get away with more than they should. She seems problematic and perhaps your long-standing relationship is clouding your judgement. But from what I read, she\u2019s a jerk.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nYou are not her personal pregnancy slave.\n\nShe's not a very good \"friend\" from the sound of it", "NTA. She\u2019s so jealous that you\u2019re pregnant too that she may not realize how crazy she\u2019s coming off with her demands and whatnot. Focus on yourself and your baby. Tell husband he\u2019s got your blessing to ban her from your home - at least for awhile. To say your priority needs to be her pregnancy is ludicrous from all angles.", "There\u2019s a lot more Mom-calling on this thread than there is in the real world. I am pretty positive that none of my wife\u2019s friends have her Mom\u2019s phone number yet on Reddit everyone knows everyone\u2019s phone numbers and is totally comfortable discussing interpersonal disagreements with relatives.", "It's not your fault she doesn't drive. If the baby daddy isn't around,  that's also not your fault. Plenty of single moms take the bus where they need to go. \n\nIt could be hormones, but that's no excuse.  You are NTA.", "NTA but in danger of setting a frustrating precedent. There is nothing to suggest that she\u2019ll \u00ab\u00a0back off\u00a0\u00bb or become independent after the birth of her baby. Will she need you to drive her and baby to appointments or to get groceries? Will you be asked to babysit or come over when she can\u2019t keep up with everything? It\u2019s clear you are a kind hearted person but you need to start putting the well being of your own child before the needs of your childish friend. And as many others have asked, where is her partner??!!", "NTA\n\nYou need to cut her off. Like yesterday.", "NTA! \nWhere the F is her husband/baby daddy?! You didn\u2019t impregnate her, also why are you letting her speak to you that way? I would never in a million years scream at my BF or demand anything. Does she not drive?\nAlso can we please stop blaming hormones for the rudeness and entitlement! \n\n\nit\u2019s better to establish boundaries/rules! Once her baby comes she will demand more, since she\u2019s been getting away with all this now.", "NTA, wtf she sounds terrible", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are also pregnant and she should understand that it is not all about her.", "NTA even if you wasn't pregnant you didn't get her pregnant and any help you give her she should be greatful rather than expect things. It her child she has to find a  way of looking after herself and it not relying on you", "NTA - You are not her partner. If she expected you to be full time support for her pregnancy, she should have cleared that with you before she got pregnant. Being excited and telling her you are there for her is not the same thing as agreeing to be her partner in her pregnancy. Even if you were not also pregnant, she still would not be entitled to all of your time and energy. \n\nYou need to put up some serious boundaries NOW, because she is not going to get better once she has a newborn - she is going to get worse.", "NTA, she is not a friend.", "NTA- and you aren't her friend, you're her doormat- at least that what she thinks of you. If I was your husband I'd have pressed this far more than what you've indicated. Where is her partner in this? Why isn't he stepping up?  I would simply tell her- anybody with the gall to tell me their baby is more important than mine or has priority over mine is not my friend. I apologize for nothing and lose my number.", "NTA she is being entitled massively and you definitely need to put some boundaries in place otherwise it\u2019s going to get a whole lot worse. I hope your pregnancy is going well and have a safe and healthy delivery.", "NTA.  Your \"friend\" is ungrateful and acting like a spoiled brat.  She will get worse when her baby is born.  You need to hold to your boundaries and really consider cutting her loose.", "It's not your fault she doesn't drive. If the baby daddy isn't around,  that's also not your fault. Plenty of single moms take the bus where they need to go. \n\nIt could be hormones, but that's no excuse.  You are NTA.", "Did you get her pregnant? Are you her partner? Your friend Sarah sounds like she needs to always be the center of attention. For the sake of your mental health and your baby it\u2019s time to create some well needed distance. \n\nNTA", "NTaa.  She isn\u2019t your friend.  Cut her off.", "NTA and if she got pregnant in July then she's due in February or March right? So she's got an entire trimester to go so idk what this \"put up with it because it's almost over\" nonsense is. (Edit: just saw she found out she was 11 weeks pregnant in July so she is closer to her due date than I originally guessed)\n\nStress is one of the worst things you can expose yourself to in pregnancy, worse than soft cheeses and deli meats! Take care of yourself first and help her if you can after that. I bet she won't stop being entitled to your time after the baby is born so lay your boundaries down now.", "NTA. Cut her off.", "No she hasn't once asked how I am doing just what I could do for her.", "I don't really know what happened with her family but they are no contact.", "No this is incredibly new behavior. Before pregnancy she was honestly a great friend. But since she found out she was pregnant she has had a 180 in personality.", "She does not have a partner. The father of her child has a number of other kids. Honestly she didn't even know she was pregnant until she went in to get a routine test done and the doctor told her she was 11 weeks pregnant.", "Yeah when she moved go our state my mom took her to job interviews, apartment hunting, and shopping a lot. They had a really good bond for a few years.", "When she told the man she has been sleeping with she was pregnant. He blew up on her because he didn't want another kid and hasn't seen her since. They weren't in a relationship just a fwb kind of thing. So he's been low contact no help so far. As for the no driving thing honestly I don't know what's holding that up.", "I think you need to set some serious boundaries like yesterday. The way things are going, in 6 months you\u2019ll find her kid in a car seat at your front door for free babysitting because hey you already have one baby, what\u2019s one more!!?", "Even if you weren't pregnant, you aren't her assistant. She needs to get several grips on herself and calm down. I get raging hormones, but I used to tell myself, I better slap myself before someone else did so.", "It will get worse once she has a baby, so start building some walls now.\n\nNTA and grats being pregnant yourself.", "Well if Sarah acted like that with them...maybe that's the motive.", "Has she asked you how your pregnancy is going? \nHas she asked for rides or demanded you take her? \nOP she\u2019s not driving, you have been stepping up and helping her out! But have you stopped and to think that you not putting some boundaries with her, will affect you in the long run! Who\u2019s going to take her and her baby to doctors appointments?", "Sounds like a personal problem."]}
