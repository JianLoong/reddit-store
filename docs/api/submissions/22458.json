I have a 7 and 5 year old. Their dad passed away then they were 3, and 9 months old, at the age of 21.(I'll call him D) So for a year and a half after he passed, I was a single mother doing my best to be the best I could be for them and provide everything they could need/want. Before finding the man who is everything I could ever need. He's literally everything I never knew I needed. During the time I was alone D's mom helped out when I needed help. We have a great relationship and I love her with all my heart. Sense getting in my relationship, moving an hour and a half away from home and starting over that has lessened drastically. However, D's father has never been around due to the fact of him being in prison. He was in prison was for a long time. D would be turning 27 this year, and I'm almost positive that he was a toddler when his father went to prison. The Charge involving a young girl. Here's the crazy part for me.... D's mom calls me about a week ago, randomly. Saying that D's dad is out of prison. And living with her. Sense FEBRUARY. She wants to know can my boys meet him. THEN asks if she can have them for a few days the following week so she can see them and spend time with them. They'd never be left alone with him and so on and so on. I was completely flabbergasted! I was so shocked at the fact that this man was out, let alone living with her (all the stories I've heard are crazy). I've never met this man. I have no idea anything about him except that he is on Megan's law. I decided not to even respond to her because I don't want to create drama where it's not needed. I've already decided they aren't going before I even got off the phone. Period. But I feel so torn with what D would feel like. All I'm doing is looking out for their safety and wellbeing.im doing just that. But I mean, AITA?\n\n\nEDIT; I've also been informed that his other children don't want him involved with their lives nor their children's lives. They all have known he has been home. I'm last to know. I feel like I was like a last resort type of thing, like she could slyly do it without me thinking I know what I know.", "created_utc": 1689570145, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151s7bz/aita_for_not_letting_my_boys_meet_and_get_to_know/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What you are being asked to do is dangerous. You cannot and should not agree to put them in that dangerous situation and she has no right to ask. \n\nYou are currently being manipulated into a situation that you are not happy about. \n\nStop feeling guilty.

Go with your gut, but realize that you may not be able to trust MIL now the way you have before. \n\nI get that you have \"what would D want\" in the back of your mind, but even if he was here, you wouldn't be okay with your kids knowing that man, right? You'd push back, right? Trust yourself. If something happened, D wouldn't be the one living with it and blaming himself.", "No, no, no!!!\n\nTrust your instincts.  And forget about your kids ever being in the care of their paternal grandmother without you present ever again.  Never, ever.  She can come see them at your house.\n\nWhether your children meeting the grandfather was first, second, or two-hundredth on her list -- that doesn't matter.  What matters is keeping your kids safe.\n\nSo no, she can't have them for a few days EVER.  \n\nNTA", "Um. What. \n\nThe fact he is living with her now is super concerning, she either \n1) believes he\u2019s innocent/not a threat to family\n2) thinks what he did is forgivable and not a big deal \n3) is extremely weak and easy for him to manipulate \n4) loves him and wants to cater to him \n\nHer knowing what he did, allowing him to live with her because of one of those reasons, and IMMEDIATELY asking to have your children visit for multiple nights to spend time with him without you is honestly disturbing. \n\nHer trying to get in front of your concerns saying they\u2019d never be alone with him is just naive, or intentionally misleading. They would absolutely be alone and vulnerable at times. Abusers access kids in the same house as other adults *all the goddamn time.* \nEvery time she uses the bathroom, takes a call, cooks, has a shower, goes into another room or *sleeps for EIGHT hours* your kids would be at risk. Why is she okay with risking your kids like that? \n\nIt sounds like her judgement is irredeemably flawed and she is no longer someone you can trust with you kids, no matter what she says in the future (eg he has moved out and \u201cwon\u2019t visit\u201d if they stay with her). If she has spare keys to your place I would change the locks, or alarm codes etc. don\u2019t send her photos of your kids. Have visits at your place / public places and supervised the whole time. \n\nAlso I would look into grandparents rights in your state. Your husband passing away and her heavy involvement with your kids could give her grounds so I would just cover bases in case she pushes back irrationally. Especially make sure you have written communication of her insane requests to have your kids around a registered child predator.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
