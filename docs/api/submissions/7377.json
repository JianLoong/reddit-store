Trying to get you to subscribe to \"the family business.\" That kind of crap has no place at work... whether it's someone trying to pressure you to come to their Pampered Chef party or subscribe to their OF channel, it shouldn't be allowed.\n\nYOU weren't meddling, you never asked to hear his weird-ass pitch, and this could be considered sexual harrassment.

I know it\u2019s \u201csex work\u201d and not \u201csex.\u201d But it is highly *sexual* and it\u2019s super incest-y for siblings to be involved sexually with each other. Her OF is explicitly sexual. There\u2019s no gray area when it comes to a dude looking at (and TAKING) sexual pictures of his sister.\n\nThe nice thing to do is if either of the siblings want to discuss OF at work and you feel uncomfortable with it, let them know *once* and then report them the moment they do it again. The equally reasonable thing to do would be to report them now because WTF? It\u2019s one thing if you\u2019re close with a coworker and they mention on break or outside of work that they do OF. It\u2019s another thing entirely to bring it up right when you meet someone, *at work*, and then *brag about both the OF and the incestuous relationship you have with your sibling.*\n\nThis is so fucking weird.", "Hell no!
