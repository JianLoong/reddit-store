You can get your ass banned from the airline you did it on, and like the GF, often the airline's network partners (like oneworld, SkyTeam, or Star Alliance) will ban you as well.\n\nShe FAFO'd big time.", "Its a major problem ***everywhere***. Every major carrier is having to deal with people doing this for cheaper flights. Most have policies now, both at home in the States and abroad.\n\nThese days they would fill the seat with an overbook at the flight location, but still would flag you for bailing. Once they have enough of a pattern to determine you are doing this they ban you in the states as well. Some airlines actually have fees they can asses on you and send to collections for it.", "This method of \u201ccheap travel\u201d went viral a little bit ago and it seems like most airlines have gotten more aggressive with cracking down. I\u2019m surprised that she was able to get away with it so many times honestly. Still sucks that people have to pay so much to travel anyway but it\u2019s gotten pretty common unfortunately", "I'm curious about the luggage situation as well. Whenever I've had a layover, I don't get my luggage until I'm at the end destination", "US airlines will do it too", "Being stupid and thinking you know better doesn\u2019t warrant being spoken to like that by someone who\u2019s supposed to love you though", "Sorry, I deleted my previous comment b/c I thought it was a different thread. LOL \n\nANYWAY, yes she was dumb. He was also verbally abusive to her. \n\nThe suckage is abundant both ways.", "No argument here. I don\u2019t disagree with her but if it was against the rules then she broke them.", "Well, she did cheat the airline though, by booking the whole 3 stop flight she paid for a seat to be used that whole time, so no one else can use that seat and it remains empty because it's booked, meaning someone who could have originally gotten on that flight is now unable to because she wanted a cheaper flight.", "Certainly true and I would be pissed of as well but to actually insult your partner by calling him/her 'a fucking moron' to their face seems like a few bridges too far.", "fr why are they banning people for this like you already got the money so why are you mad", "Sure, there's nothing morally wrong* with what OPs GF was doing.\n\nBut because of her doing that, they need to redo plans, figure out another airline, etc etc. That's why she's an asshole.\n\n*that said, while I have no issue with what the GF was doing, it is still explicitly against the rules of the airline. Which she agreed to follow when buying the ticket. So from that point of view, yeah its morally wrong.", "I just don't understand why the the airline cares. I mean they get her money regardless where she gets off. So I don't understand why they ban people for it.", "Nope. I said she sounds narcissistic because of how the OP described their interactions. But it\u2019s funny how you jump to conclusions in order to start conflict.", "Nope. She could potentially ruin their trip to see his parents. She deserves it", "Because that seat could have went to another person.

Greedy airlines and it isn\u2019t like they hadn\u2019t over sold the flight anyway.", "So tracking your logic here? We shouldn't model proper adult behavior we should sink to the level of others? Was her actions ill-advised? Obviously... but talking like a total AH to your S/O is just wrong no matter what, it does not accomplish anything and just adds to an issue that could have been simple to solve. \n\nJust because you are upset over something does not give a person the right to berate or be a bully and that's what he was doing being a know it all turned bully when we happened to be right this time.  Name calling is what children do, if you can't act like an adult in a relationship maybe DONT BE IN ONE.", "But why?", "But like, why? I must be missing something . Who is OP hurting by doing this? She paid for a seat and didn\u2019t use it, in theory no one is hurt . The airline got their money? What law is this violating?

Yes\n\nAre they in the clear for banning her? Also yes. The two concepts are no mutually exclusive.", "Why is it a no-no? Because it's against the Conditions of Carriage you agree to when you purchase your ticket?\n\nWhy is it against the CoC? Because you are depriving the airline of revenue they otherwise would have rightfully earned by transporting you from your origin to your intended destination. \n\nI am not advocating if this practice is fair or not (I've flown a great deal in my life so I have a complicated relationship with airlines in general) but it is absolutely against the contract you agreed to when you purchased your ticket.", "The airline charges more for a direct flight. So if she had booked a direct flight, she would have paid them more. They would also have been able to theoretically book someone from the layover site as a direct flight to the 2nd destination as well, so they lost that income, too.   \n\n\nExample: US->France->Germany is less than US -> Germany and France -> Germany (two direct flights) so they are out the money she would have paid and the other passenger on the France direct flight would have paid.", "Its a complex thing, but the airline is, in fact, losing money. The flights are a complex lattice of seats, fuel costs, and pattern recognition. Costs are adjusted on the booking side to push people into specific configurations that allow things to move about in a specific way. When you book a flight, algorithms essentially make the penalty of a layover into a discount, while a direct flight to that same layover place likely costs a bit more.\n\nSo what at the superficial level it looks like she isn't using all she paid for (so no harm no foul), the reality is closer to she is manipulating the system to get a discount she doesn't qualify for. And this loophole has become so commonplace that people are using it ***all the time***.\n\nOn the morality front, I see no problem with doing so! They made this system, its sorta a problem on their end. But from the airline companies perspective, they operate on pretty tight margins with a ton of competition and a lot of uncontrollable pressures such as fuel prices. All these manipulations to the booking software do add up to a substantial loss in profit across the board.", "Thank you! I thought the exact same thing.", "Yeah I guess she could have had just her carry-on, didn't think of that", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
