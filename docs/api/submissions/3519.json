It's greed when a company wants to optimize for money, but \"smart\" when's she's trying to optimize for money?", "Then she broke a rule, but breaking a rule doesn't make you an asshole when the rule is unreasonable in the first place.", "Yes, sometimes I\u2019m willing to pay a little bit more for a little bit less to make sure I don\u2019t just mindlessly eat or drink the extra calories, even though I can get more food for less money. \n\nThese companies have products that cost them pennies to produce, so if we buy them at any price, they make a profit. So they just push out more product, and people think, wow, what a great deal! And it gets normalized.", "Except the pizza place doesn't ban you if you order the party size pizza and then only eat a small amount of pizza.", "Why should airlines encourage travel to \"specific markets\" (cities)? That's actually pretty messed up.", "The travel experts on YouTube say that if you do this enough, an airline can ban you. This is what happened with OP's gf.", "Here is an interesting article about it - it is apparently just airlines being angry that people are gaming the system and paying less than what they want to charge for different destinations https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190226-the-travel-trick-that-airlines-hate", "They do but the taxes on each passenger\u2019s ticket as it relates to landing fees directly relates to their airport of final arrival. This is extremely prevalent in the US as well. For example, total ticket tax and landing fees are cheaper for passengers flying to the Dallas area if they continue a connection to Tyler, TX when in reality the passenger intends to stop in Dallas. I worked for American and passengers were banned regularly for doing this exact thing. I don\u2019t understand all of the intricacies that go into the policies and I also don\u2019t police how others fly. That said, it\u2019s a real thing that happens and I was simply trying to explain why the fare differences exist booking connections that the passenger doesn\u2019t intend to fly.", "This is illegal in Europe as it should be.", "I always read about this, but I've never actually heard of it happening in real life (UK, mainly flights around Europe).\n\nIs it just a US thing? Or have I/others I know just been very lucky?", "The EU has strict rules for airlines and how they have to compensate passengers and it can cost then a lot not money. DH and I missed a connection from Amsterdam to Vancouver a few years ago because of flight out of Paris was delayed and we had to spend 2 nights in Amsterdam before we could be rebooked on a flight home and the airline paid for our hotel, taxis, meals and because we couldn't take our luggage as it was checked all the way through they paid for our clothing and toiletries as well as additional compensation. If she books a flight to Lisbon but stays in Madrid and doesn't go through to Lisbon and the flight to Lisbon is delayed or cancelled she is entitled to compensation. This stuff adds up over time.", "I don't actually think this is true in OPs case. I've never heard of anyone being bumped from a flight in Europe (as someone from the UK, who has flown a fair amount of times throughout Europe).\n\nI've had plenty of flights that were completely full, and never seen or heard anyone being bumped. Might happen but very rarely. Definitely not like it seemingly does in the US", "I think a lot of people know that there is something *henky*, but perhaps not *why* it's henky. At the end of the day, all those 5-10% discounts become quite a bit, as there are usually hundreds of thousands of fliers a day worldwide.\n\nThe ***other*** potential problem is how it throws off scheduling algorithms, which hurts local airports. If everyone is taking the layover flight rather than the direct flight, the airport will get fewer direct flights scheduled to it. That also means fewer direct flights out of that location. Which, over time, hurts local flyers quite a bit.", "It's been explained elsewhere in the thread, if you are curious!", "They're mad they didn't get to upcharge you for the direct flight.", "Happy to help! :)", "Gonna get downvoted to oblivion, but I'm having a difficult time feeling badly for an airline.", "Yeah it's greed when a multibilliondollar company wants to make even more profit while exploiting their workers and customers. When a single person just wants to have a cheaper flight in an economy where normal people fear that they don't have enough money to get thru the winter with inflation still rising, then I don't blame those people for not letting themselves getting exploited for more profit.", "Yes. Yes it does make you the TA. If you gonna follow the rules then choose a different airline if you don\u2019t like the rule.", "Emirates and Qatar have an interest in pushing traffic through their major hubs and will want to milk passengers who have a few hours to spend on a layover. It\u2019s also no big secret that you can get super cheap fares in business class if you travel from a smaller airport or from a country that\u2019s not as wealthy through a hub to a destination. Then of course there\u2019s the obvious delays caused by passengers who do not take their connecting flight and figuring out what happened to them. Yes it\u2019s most likely they ditched the onward connection but they could have been hospitalised or just got lost. \n\nNot saying that any of this makes sense or is ethical on the part of the airlines but it\u2019s all covered in the terms or carriage. Airlines want to make money and they\u2019re more than happy to cut dead wood that inhibits that goal.", "Yeah I'm aware of that. What I'm asking is does the airline suffer some kind of consequence from what OPs gf did. Like do they get fined or taxed or something", "She would get compensated only if she missed the flight due to the airline (for example earlier flight being late). And as it seems she is at fault, she won\u2019t get anything apart from a ban as it was not her first time", "Same", "Sure, but how about the people who actually want to get to the final destination but have to deal with sparser bookings and increased price because of loophole-seeking clowns?", "I would disagree that this is exploitation but let's give you the point they're still plenty of other reasons why this is pretty f***** up.\n\n Doing this actively denies a seat to someone who wants to go to that final destination or in the absolute best case scenario makes everyone else who's interested have to pay more. And even further still you're screwing up weight and balance considerations on the aircraft by the airline expecting a person and their luggage to be on board. That's extra fuel that had to be purchased that they didn't need which is bad for the environment and a wasted resource which also drives ticket prices up for everyone. Also if a flight to Portugal was canceled the day before That's not just denying people on LOT the right to go to Lisbon that's denying someone a seat on any of the other airlines who would be trying to rebook passengers to get to Lisbon. Another thing to consider is that individual airports and cities will charge landing rights and will charge different rates for passengers or only transiting through the airport versus getting off at the airport and some may even provide tax credits and bonuses. This could be a situation where the reason why It cost more to land in Madrid is because Madrid taxes more per passenger who's getting off in their airport and Lisbon may be providing a tax credit for someone who gets off in their airport. So now the airlines not getting a tax credit from Lisbon and now has to pay more in taxes to Madrid also countries care a lot about these things there are fines for having an inaccurate manifest, these countries were expecting someone to be passing through and another to be having plus one visitor whereas what actually ended up happening is the transit country now has plus one visitor and the supposed final destination has no visitor at all those governments may also levy heavy fines to the airline. And this affects immigration policy of both countries. You have this happen often enough you may find that your tickets all around may just be plain more expensive.\n\nIt isn't greed that's the only issue You're screwing up a delicate and finally tuned logistical system and you're making it worse for everyone else because of your individual selfishness", "Or don't follow the rules and risk getting banned. I think we just have to disagree on this one because I don't think breaking a rule made by corporate greed is something that makes someone an asshole.", "They have wasted employee time, since the person is known to have been at rhe Airport (since they were on the manifest of the plane that arrived) so they have to try to track the person down, once they miss the flight they have to notify the tsa and baggage handling."]}
