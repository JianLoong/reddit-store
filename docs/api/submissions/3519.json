Then of course there\u2019s the obvious delays caused by passengers who do not take their connecting flight and figuring out what happened to them. Yes it\u2019s most likely they ditched the onward connection but they could have been hospitalised or just got lost. \n\nNot saying that any of this makes sense or is ethical on the part of the airlines but it\u2019s all covered in the terms or carriage. Airlines want to make money and they\u2019re more than happy to cut dead wood that inhibits that goal.", "Yeah I'm aware of that.

And even further still you're screwing up weight and balance considerations on the aircraft by the airline expecting a person and their luggage to be on board. That's extra fuel that had to be purchased that they didn't need which is bad for the environment and a wasted resource which also drives ticket prices up for everyone. Also if a flight to Portugal was canceled the day before That's not just denying people on LOT the right to go to Lisbon that's denying someone a seat on any of the other airlines who would be trying to rebook passengers to get to Lisbon. Another thing to consider is that individual airports and cities will charge landing rights and will charge different rates for passengers or only transiting through the airport versus getting off at the airport and some may even provide tax credits and bonuses. This could be a situation where the reason why It cost more to land in Madrid is because Madrid taxes more per passenger who's getting off in their airport and Lisbon may be providing a tax credit for someone who gets off in their airport. So now the airlines not getting a tax credit from Lisbon and now has to pay more in taxes to Madrid also countries care a lot about these things there are fines for having an inaccurate manifest, these countries were expecting someone to be passing through and another to be having plus one visitor whereas what actually ended up happening is the transit country now has plus one visitor and the supposed final destination has no visitor at all those governments may also levy heavy fines to the airline. And this affects immigration policy of both countries.

In Australia, it's illegal to overbook a flight, so the airlines don't do it.  So this stops someone else taking that seat.\n\nOf course, we don't have layover flights like elsewhere because of the nature of country and complete lack of alternative transport.  It's like Melbourne to Sydney is one of the busiest flights in the world (3rd in the world), despite our small population... and it's because there's no alternative.", "They ban you because you've caused the hassle of not being able to sell that seat in the first place. You only pay a portion of the ticket towards the seat. Also they have to wait for you to show and have to go through procedures for security for a missing passenger. Lots of admin and bullshit.

I call BS on airlines holding planes very often.  My experience is that they used to do this, like 10 years ago, but don't do it much anymore.\n\nALSO - if the airlines didn't penalize people for doing this, people would just tell the airline they were skipping the last flight, and even if they were going to hold the plane, they will know not to...  so essentially pointing out that the airline caused their own problem, and now shouldn't do something because it would mess up the problem they themselves caused, by doing the thing.", "Yeah, and what if she didn't check in for the second leg of her flight?

So don't wait. Or just that, she knows she will miss it and won't be fit to fly until tomorrow. / Her back painis so much that she can't get back onto the plane and needs to lay down for a day and will get the train tomorrow or whatever. \n\nEffectively telling them (with an excuse) that she won't be getting back on so they aren't waiting and calling her again and again before they change the passenger manifest. \n\nI had a plane delayed for 45 min in a super not busy airport because of a passenger who failed to board (wasn't even a connection).\nThe pilot hoped in to apologise and explained they had to wait, \nChange the manifest and send it for approval, remove luggage, modssed his runway slot, during the delay the wind changed and he then had to change his flight plan to account for the different take off direction, get this new flight plan approved, wait for another runway slot. \n\nSo we were 40mon late.

If the airlines didn't have a policy of banning people who did it they could just have the person touch a button on the app to let them know they can give their seat away and avoid all of that. \n\nSo far this sounds like it's just the airports being petty about people using loopholes that don't actually cost them anything except the costs they create with their own policies.", "That's a cost of doing business.

Meanwhile the aviation world is divided into 3 \u201calliances\u201d which probably means that they coordinate these decisions as well.", "So I'ma copy and paste a comment I made earlier, the person I originally replied to was arguing that this behavior had no unethical sides but I did touch on a few of the economic reasons. But I'll post the whole thing in its entirety.\n\n\n>I would disagree that this is exploitation but let's give you the point they're still plenty of other reasons why this is pretty f***** up.\n\n>Doing this actively denies a seat to someone who wants to go to that final destination or in the absolute best case scenario makes everyone else who's interested have to pay more. And even further still you're screwing up weight and balance considerations on the aircraft by the airline expecting a person and their luggage to be on board. That's extra fuel that had to be purchased that they didn't need which is bad for the environment and a wasted resource which also drives ticket prices up for everyone, it serves little more than useless ballast to hauled around. Also if a flight to Portugal was canceled the day before That's not just denying people on LOT the right to go to Lisbon that's denying someone a seat on any of the other airlines who would be trying to rebook passengers to get to Lisbon. Another thing to consider is that individual airports and cities will charge landing rights and will charge different rates for passengers or only transiting through the airport versus getting off at the airport and some may even provide tax credits and bonuses. This could be a situation where the reason why It cost more to land in Madrid is because Madrid taxes more per passenger who's getting off in their airport and Lisbon may be providing a tax credit for someone who gets off in their airport. So now the airlines not getting a tax credit from Lisbon and now has to pay more in taxes to Madrid also countries care a lot about these things there are fines for having an inaccurate manifest, these countries were expecting someone to be passing through and another to be having plus one visitor whereas what actually ended up happening is the transit country now has plus one visitor and the supposed final destination has no visitor at all those governments may also levy heavy fines to the airline. And this affects immigration policy of both countries. You have this happen often enough you may find that your tickets all around may just be plain more expensive.\n\n>It isn't greed that's the only issue You're screwing up a delicate and finally tuned logistical system and you're making it worse for everyone else because of your individual selfishness", "It will be, there isn\u2019t a \u2018check out\u2019 process and customs/ immigration doesn\u2019t check people out or list them, they literally just check ID in Europe", "It's all about economies of scale, load, and the ability to pick pax up via connecting flights. When you bail on a leg, you create an inefficiency for the airline, and that costs them money, and lost revenue.\n\nThis is a complex subject, and there are literally people with math and operations PhDs who work for the airlines doing route planning. I met one of the UAL ones once...had a fascinating talk with him about it.\n\nThe only way to solve it according to your axiom, is, as you say, to re-regulate the airlines. But that would take us back to a LOT of the problems that the traveling public had prior to the ADRA of 1978. As a consumer, that's not a market I long to have.", "So regardless of whether or not I get off in Paris the ticket is still categorized as domestic. Therefore the airline does not lose money.", "That doesn't make sense unless the subsidy is more than the total cost of that second leg which seems unlikely.", "> Also different airports have different fees and taxes associated with the airport.\n\nThat makes no sense, because a flight with a layover in the expensive airport is still using the expensive airport.", "I have nothing against it morally, but I also have nothing against airlines banning people who do it. That pricing model is the key to the current hub-and-spoke system currently in place.", "The other major issue is as surprising as it is, most airlines operate at a bare minimum break even or sometimes even a loss. Many airlines credit card programs are actually more profitable than the airlines themselves. The valuation of United airlines is less than United airlines mileage club. Same with delta vs Delta Skymiles. There\u2019s a couple of good videos explaining now airlines are more operating as banks than airlines. And their main goal as an airline is to avoid loosing more money per year. And People complain of ticketing costs but 40 years ago no one could even afford to fly. Now almost anyone could afford a ticket. If we appropriately scaled flight costs from back in the 70s to now, a domestic flight should be around 1k anywhere and international starting at 3-4K for a round trip. So finding ways to avoid losses is the main goal from the airlines side. Also it makes me wonder if you do hidden city flying if it is any less likely to get banned if you are also a mileage club member.", "Many years ago US airlines figured out customers were doing this and one of their remedies was once you were a \u201cno-show\u201d for the last leg of their flight your reservation were cancelled down line as well.  It was an effective way to stop the behavior but impacted only passengers holding round trip tickets.  Now people frequently discover round trip tickets don\u2019t actually save any money and they can access more convenient schedules by using one airline for an  outbound flight and a different airline for the return.  Make no mistake, as an ex-travel agent owner I know airlines will take whatever steps necessary to protect their bottom line.  They are able to track you quite successfully and a \u201chidden city flight\u201d will not go unnoticed.  You may get away with it for a while because you\u2019re using one-way tickets but when you\u2019re caught the advantage goes to the airline.  Much like the Apple agreement you agree to before installing the most recent update, each ticket come with a \u201ccontract of carriage.\u201d  By purchasing a ticket you HAVE agreed to their terms.  Trust me, that agreement wasn\u2019t written to benefit the passenger.", "Here in Germany you can get mineral water or milk as a drink at MC Donalds. And it's not cheaper to have more food.

Salad, small burger, milk, apple slices.", "My understanding is \u201chidden city\u201d ticketing is NOT actually illegal though it does violate the \u201ccontract of carriage\u201d you agreed to when purchasing a ticket.  The airlines have lost lawsuits over the process.  BUT, such behavior also violates the \u201crules\u201d of almost all \u201cFrequent Flyer\u201d programs and the airlines have begun punishing the behavior by zeroing out peoples banked airline miles and eliminated any other perks and the \u201cstatus\u201d the program granted.", "The government doesn't pay by leg though, they pay a certain amount to each airport every year, the airports in turn have contracts with the airlines. Each flight has to have a certain number of passengers each year to remain eligible for the program. So if the airline has a lucrative contact with a particular airport, they will offer low enough prices to entice the required number of people to travel to/from that airport.", "Yes, what about the bags? Sometimes they get transferred automatically into the new plane.", "It might not impact their costs, but it does impact their revenue. \n\nIf airlines could make more money by always having direct flights being cheaper than connecting flight they would jump on it in a heart beat. \n\nThe airline get to set the price and terms, if you don't like it don't fly with them.\n\nThe same way if a pizza place wants to say you have to jump on one foot 20 times to order from us, if you don't like it just don't order from them. \n\nBy pricing a layover flight cheaper it pushes extra people on the first/second leg allowing the airline to maximize ouccupancy rates for different legs and overall revenue.", "I guess it doesn't actually work if you have checked in bags. Thinking about it, she probably just uses handluggage.", "Ah, that makes sense then.
