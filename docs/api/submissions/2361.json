I live at home with my parents for now and could technically afford the $400 but I'm pretty young and have only just started the first real paid position of my life about half a year ago (a contract that has absolutely no job security) so I've just been trying to save up money and don't really feel like I can justify spending that much on a recreational trip right now.\n\nMy boyfriend/his parents have made it clear to me that they're planning on going on this cruise regardless of if I come with them or not. If I don't go my boyfriend will either get a single occupancy room or he and his parents will pay to upgrade his parent's room to a suite and he'll stay in that suite with them. Both of these options are more expensive to them than if I went and evenly split that cost of a double occupancy room with my boyfriend (so me going with them and paying for half the room with my boyfriend saves them money on the cruise). **I've told my boyfriend that what I'm willing to do is cover whatever the difference, if any, there is between the cost of having me join them and the cost they would otherwise pay for the three of them to go by themselves.**\n\nMy boyfriend was incensed by this suggestion because he thought it wouldn't be fair for me to pay less to go on this cruise than he and each of his parents were. He said that I would essentially be getting a subsidy paid for by him and/or his parents. But, in my eyes I feel like *I'd* be the one subsidizing the cost of *their* trip if I were to pay the $400 because I'm not the one who's trying to schedule a cruise at this point in my financial life even though I'd love to go.\n\nI did tell my boyfriend that if he goes on the cruise without me I'll be pissed because if he really wanted me there, he'd accept that I'm making an offer to come along with him at no cost to him/his family. It's not like I'm asking him to buy my ticket. I'm willing to contribute money, but I'm asking to only pay whatever the actual additional costs are of me joining them on this cruise.\n\nAITA here?

You dont want to pay but you dont want him to go without you either! Sounds like none of you can afford to go. YTA", "Have you been on a cruise before and understand pricing? 400 is cheap. How many days is it for? You saying that they will end up paying more for another room if you don't go.  Well yeah thats how it works. The more people you have in a room in a cruise the less it costs. So if you don't go then they have to figure out a different room situation that won't be as expensive as them staying with what they have right now. Like idk if you want to go then go and have fun and also realize that you will have other expenses in the cruise at ports if you want to get off and do activities. If you want the cheapest trip then stay on the boat during ports and don't buy anything. Eat at the buffet and at the free restaurants. Dont buy any drinks and etc. \n\n\nI've been on several cruises and I'm cheap as hell. So I'm just letting you know there is more to a cruise then just being on a boat and not spending other money.", "Personally, and this is just me, if you can't afford to do this right now, then the correct answer is. \"Wow! Thanks for wanting me along; I'd love to go! But I can't afford it right now. I hope you all have a great time. Hopefully we can do a cruise together in the future. Thanks again!\"\n\nAnd then, you enjoy the pictures you get and stories you hear and save up for a cruise or trip or whatever with them in the future. A really nice person shouldn't get mad if the BF goes on the trip with his parents. That's not appropriate at all.", ">I did tell my boyfriend that if he goes on the cruise without me I'll be pissed\n\nTHIS is why YTA. I was on your side until this part.", "YTA for expecting your BF's parents to subsidize your trip.  If you can't afford to go, then say you can't afford to go.  You're also TA for telling your BF that you'll be pissed if he takes the opportunity to go on a trip with his parents without you.  You're not his wife, so you really have no say in what he can and can't do.  If you're this much of a control freak before you're even married, I'd hate to see what would happen if you were to tie the knot with him.  It's no wonder your BF considers this a breaking point.  You just hoisted a giant red flag.", "YTA- 400$ isn\u2019t very much to pay to go on a cruise. I don\u2019t think you would be subsiding their trip at all. I also didn\u2019t like to hear that you would be mad if he went.", "YTA If you don't want to spend the 400 dollar, you can just choose not to go. But to tell him you want him and his family to pay for part of your trip or you'll be angry at him, is just a selfish move.", "How old are you and how old is your bf?", "YTA. I can smell the entitlement through the screen. Either pay the same as everyone else or don't go but don't complain about not going if you choose that option.", "YTA.\n\nIf you don't have the money, then don't go.  And if you do have the money but choose to not spend it on the cruise, then don't go but don't give your bf an ultimatum about choosing your \"offer\" or not going.\n\nYou are making yourself look like an entitled A H to his family.  Grow up and just make an adult decision and stop trying to control your bf's time.", "YTA.  \n\nif you don't wanna pay to go, that's fine, don't go.  but being mad if he goes without you means you're expecting him and his family to pay for you.\n\nyou said yourself that they were going with or without you.  so even if you feel they're trying to get you to subsidize their trip, they clearly don't care.  and just the idea you've constructed in your mind that by going you would be somehow saving them money is ludicrous.", "YTA. I was originally on your side up until the end where you said you told your boyfriend that if he goes without you, you'll be pissed. You're the asshole for that part.\n\nThat's fine if you don't want to pay the $400 to go. You're not the asshole for that.\n\nYour boyfriend isn't an asshole for not accepting your offer of a reduced payment. Don't try to pressure him into accepting the uneven payment. Just say you can't afford half.\n\nNot to mention, there are cabins on the ship that will accommodate 3 people (sometimes a suite if you look at the nicer ones), but it won't be as comfortable or cost efficient as two double occupancy rooms. These rooms are often used for a couple that has children that are also traveling with them.", "Whoa YTA. They already made it clear to you they're willing to go without you, and they'll pay whatever they need to for the room. It's honestly laughable that you think you're doing them a huge favor by having them pay part of YOUR room cost.", "The offer is \"if you come on the cruise It will cost you $400\". Which is stupid cheap so I don't know why you're not jumping on that, but....either take the offer or don't! I get what you're saying about how it'll be cheaper for them If you go, but now you're just splitting hairs. Also you're not his wife or his mother you don't get to tell him whether he can go on a cruise or not! If this is an insecurity of yours then you need to revisit the whole dating anybody thing! \n\nWhen it comes down to it it sounds like you don't really want to go, you're not really in a position with your job where you should go and you're not happy with the cost.. So just don't go!", "YTA- you're very entitled. If you can't afford it at this time, then just say that. If you want to feel a certain kind of way if they don't subsidize you, then feel that way.  But when you start demanding things-  nope, it's all you. That's entitle AH behavior.", ">I did tell my boyfriend that if he goes in the cruise without me I\u2019ll be pissed\n\nYTA\n\nYou\u2019re not only trying to get him and his family to pay for part of your *half* of a room, but you\u2019re telling him that if he goes on a vacation with his family without you (because you won\u2019t pay your own way), that you\u2019ll hold it against him!", "if you can't afford to go you can't afford to go. shame on you for guilting your BF about going on a family vacation that YOU can't afford.\n\nYTA", "YTA. If you just accepted you couldn't afford it and left it at that you'd be fine. You being mad he's not paying for you (because 400 is a very small amount of the cost) is where you went wrong. He doesn't owe you the cruise or to miss out because you can't afford it. I get why he's mad.", "YTA. You were invited to join the family on a cruise knowing what the financial commitment would be and then tried to negotiate a better deal for yourself. \n\nNothing wrong with telling them that you won't go because it is more expensive than you feel comfortable with at this time. Don't expect your boyfriend to miss out because it doesn't suit you though... This would be entitled, controlling behaviour.", "YTA. That boyfriend needs to run.", "YTA \n\nWow, the audacity. Your rationalization has no boundaries. \n\nThey want you to pay your own way, which is perfectly reasonable. You want them to pay most of your fare, which is perfectly unreasonable. Since you have been an adult for 8 years, I'm not sure why the concept of adulting is foreign to you. \n\nAre you also expecting them to pay for your drinks and excursions, too? Souvenirs? Meals eaten and drinks while in port? \n\nThey would like you to go and pay your own way. Any intelligent person would understand that means there isn't a negotiation. It doesn't matter whether they would pay more if you're not there because it's not the point. Come down off your high horse and act like a grownup.\n\nThen you tell your bf there will be repercussions if they don't agree to your demands. I would dump you if I were him. Sounds like a lifetime of selfish demands.", "YTA. You were invited at a certain cost. You should either accept or reject the invitation you were offered, not try to negotiate the cost. You give the strong impression that you think you are doing your boyfriend & his family a favor by joining them, which is not a good look for someone joining someone else\u2019s family vacation.  Neither your boyfriend nor his family is required to vacation with you, & you are an AH for pressuring him to accept your financial offer.", "Yta\n\nJust say you don't have the money to go and leave it at that.", "YTA.  The $400 is your share of the trip and it is up to his parents whether they make him pay or not.\n\nWhen I went on a cruise with my girlfriend's family, I literally took a loan from her dad and paid him back with monthly installments - and still had to share the room with my GF and her brother.\n\nDon't complain that they are willing to have you join them and don't hold it against your BF if he goes without you.  He already said this is a dealbreaker, so I would trust him on that.", "YTA. So entitled, I\u2019d dump you.", "YTA. I\u2019m going to Mexico with my family next summer. My boyfriend can\u2019t afford the trip, no worries, we\u2019re both grown adults. Last year he went to Florida and was in Disney over the holidays to see his family. Did either of us throw fits the other did a trip we couldn\u2019t? No, that would be silly.", "YTA. You're telling him that you'd be doing him a favor by allowing his family to pay for your cruise ticket. Even if that's true in some weird parallel universe, saying it is ... not a good look on you.", "YTA, don\u2019t be so entitled. Either go and pay your fair share or don\u2019t go.", "YTA. It\u2019s not up to you how much they spend, what they spend it on etc. Don\u2019t act like you\u2019re doing them a favour when you\u2019re basically asking them to pay most of your ticket costs. Fair enough, you can\u2019t afford it. Unfortunately that\u2019s just life. Don\u2019t guilt your boyfriend over this because you feel bad. If you\u2019re still together when you\u2019re in a better financial position, then you\u2019ll be able to go on vacations together. Allow him this one and just politely say that you can\u2019t afford it.", "Yeah YTA. Your using your relationship as a weapon to make 3 people pay extra for a trip you want to go on but don't want to pay for. That's called emotional and financial abuse. \n\nAlso chipping in 400 for a cruise is pretty cheap as far as cruises go", "YTA They don\u2019t need to schedule a vacation around you and they were nice enough to invite you. How entitled are you?? And then to be angry if he goes without is laughable. He should take this as a hint and move on", "When you book a cruise, each person in the cabin has a cruise fare and taxes, fees, etc. That would be the difference in what you'd pay.

What type of cruise do you think you can get for $400?", "Keep in mind a cruise will be more than the cost of room.  You'll have mandatory tips, and drink packages.

They're inviting you to join in your own dime,  if you can't afford it you can't but YTA for existing a subsidized vacation....", "YTA for making this about you. You just should have said you can\u2019t afford to go and left it at that. And telling him you\u2019d be upset if he went with out you is a real AH move.

He\u2019s right, this is going to be a breaking point in your relationship.", "YTA - you sound incredibly cheap and entitled.

Unless it's a 3-4 day trip, and you are not considering the taxes, gratuities, and other associated costs. Do you plan to drink? Go on shore? Do literally anything? Also, which cruise line? It actually doesn't necessarily cost more for them to get a suite for 3 than it does 2 rooms. Some lines, like Norwegian, also offer rooms for single travelers. You're being offered a vacation for SUPER CHEAP. Either take it and be happy on their terms, or don't and let your boyfriend enjoy with his family. Do you really want this to be the hill you die on?

I've booked a few cruises and usually the second guest in a room is cheaper than primary person.

She is saying I will cover the remainder. \n\nFor example my last cruise had a ocean view room for $880 for two people, but $750 for one person (for the same exact room).

She does not have $400 cruise money. The question is, is it more or less than $400 for them to upgrade rooms without her. If a suite is only $300 more, then it makes no sense to subsidize her. If it costs $500, then they \u201csave\u201d at least $100 by paying for all or part of her accommodations. That\u2019s basic supply and demand.

OP declines the invitation, parents take double occupancy, bf takes single: 2 x $800 = $1600 ($533 per person) (single rooms typically cost the same as double rooms, since the cruise line is missing out on income by not filling each bed)\n\n3. OP declines the invitation, parents take suite and bf shares with them: $1500 ($500 per person)  \n\n\nOP is asking her boyfriend since his family would pay $1500 for three people to stay in his parent's suite, would the be willing to pay the same $1500 and OP kick in the extra $100 to get two double rooms. This isn't reasonable because the parents are giving up a luxury suite (shared with their son) for a standard room (alone) but actually pay $1000 instead of the original $800.  \n\n\nWhat might be reasonable is for OP to ask her boyfriend to pay the $500 he would need to pay to share his parents' suite, and let her pay $300 towards the cost of a double room. This seems reasonable if OP and her boyfriend have significantly different income/financial situations.", "Counting down days till my next cruise.  20 days lefts to go.", "Each guest is still then required to pay port fees, taxes and gratuities \n.  Those are the same regardless of 1st/2nd person rate or 3rd/4th person rate.\n\nWould it be nicer to pay the reduced 3rd/4th person rate??  Sure.

That's just nonsense. If my husband's parents invited us to go on a vacation with them, I would fully expect to pay our half. I would pay my fair share even if hubby and I kept our finances separate.
