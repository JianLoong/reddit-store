If OP had known the boyfriend for a while before hand, maybe he wouldn't have been so quick to spill the beans. \"oh hey I met your boyfriend\" understandably led to \"took me to lunch and asked if he could marry you\".

You could have just simply told her that you'd met him for the first time and that you were surprised by how serious he was in the relationship despite you never having met him previously, that would probably have gotten you everything that needed from her without ruining the surprise of something that's pretty commonly known of as a big surprise.", "YTA.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter was first mortified and then she Stockholm Syndrome-d herself into future engagement.\n\nShe could enjoy the surprise of it happening when/if he asks her.

Marriage is not a series of grand gestures, life is not a romantic comedy. Marriage is serious, engagement is not supposed to be a complex trap, scheme or riddle.\n\nTwo of them sound young and inexperienced and not so harmonious as a couple.

Ruining a surprise that there was a potential marriage on the horizon? Your daughter should have known that that would happen.

Also, if you have never met the parents, absent an estrangement, you probably haven\u2019t been together long enough to get married. I frankly would have been concerned that guy was some deranged stalker.", "No, no, no. NTA.

Gonna go against the grain and say NTA.\n\nFirst, surprise proposals always leads to drama. If they hadn't discussed marriage before he approached you that isn't a good sign for them as a couple. The fact she warmed up to the idea over the course of the day feels like she was trying to convince herself it was a good thing.\n\nThen let's talk about how it's been 3y and the parents haven't met the bf. Either it's because she is hiding the bf from parents or vice versa. If vice versa I would definitely want to know that my partner went behind my back after I told him I didn't want my parents involved to involve them. If the bf, then her reaction of being mad after thinking through the proposal of the idea makes more sense. She is probably unsure and perhaps a bit ashamed which leads to deflection. \n\nRegardless I don't think you were an asshole for sharing a super weird encounter with a person you don't know with the interested party. I'd be pissed if my parents didn't.", "NTA and ppl calling you that for ruining the surprise are ridiculous.  The fact that a man you have never met meets with you to ask permission to propose to your daughter is shocking.  I would have done the same thing you did.  If she was so in love, at what point was she going to introduce him to her parents?  She has a nerve to be upset.  The gaslighting of it all.", "We did something similar. We all went out (them, us, my parents and my aunt/daughter\u2019s godmother). Daughter excused herself to use the restroom which she didn\u2019t usually do. He asked while she was gone so we thought she knew and that is why she stepped away. She came back and my aunt joked that we said no.  She had no clue and she still brings up how it was spoiled. PLT always assume people are stupid and do the whole \u201cit probably goes without saying but\u2026\u201d thing", "Um, no, the fact that he wants to marry her should NOT BE THE SURPRISE.

Pretty sure this is a fictional post lol \ud83d\ude02", "Yikes", "So awful that they had already planned dinner the same day?", "Idk, I think the blessing nowadays is just a way to show that you\u2019ll get along with your in laws. Obviously adults do not need permission to get married.\nPersonally I\u2019d rather see this tradition evolve than erased.", "My thoughts exactly.", "Lots of people spend time with awful people!", "Avoidant attachment. My ex was like this too. It was soul crushing.", "Right? And besides. Just because BF asked her dad doesn't mean he ruined the surprise proposal. She has no idea when or how he will propose.

Everything is drugs. Everything is trauma. Humans beings cannot have a human emotion without it being some deep psychological issue apparently.

From OP's perspective, this guy could've been some weird stalker dude instead of her BF, so confirming with the daughter is literally the only right thing to do.

That would make me look for those flashing emergency exit signs...\n\nI would want my father to tell me this. But I might be biased because I would never be with someone who would do this \"asking her hand from the father\", \"asking for her father's blessing\" ancient patriarchal bs, that sticked around from the time when women were considered properties / wards of the men in their family, instead of talking to me about marriage and proposing only to me. And if I misjudged a guy, and he didn't listen to me during the relationship and he eventually does this bs, my answer would be an immediate *no*.
