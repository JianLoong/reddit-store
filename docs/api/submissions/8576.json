In your responses, you said it was implied that it was meant to be a surprise \n\nI think you\u2019re subconsciously upset about having never met this guy before even though they\u2019ve been together for 3 years (red flag by the way). I think you knew what you were doing.", "Yeah, you ruined the proposal. Your daughter should have introduced her boyfriend way before now. The fact that she had been dating someone she was serious about and never introduced him to family makes one question whether she thinks of him as a keeper.", "YTA. Why would you do that?", "YTA. How is this a question? \n\nThink of it this way. It's like he came to you to ask if a surprise party would be good. You said yes and then told the birthday person they were getting a surprise party. You didn't even make it one day...\n\nThe info about not knowing who he was is completely irrelevant. What matters is he was respectful enough to reach out to a person he didn't even know to ask of he can marry your daughter. And you blew it.", "INFO. Yes, you did technically spoil the surprise. But did you just assume she already knew about the proposal, and he was asking for your blessing? Also, the fact that you\u2019ve never met him before is a little odd. That means either she hasn\u2019t been dating him for very long and he is already proposing, or she has been, but has been hiding it the entirety of their relationship.

Because this is an English language forum we often assume those who post here are American, Western European or from a related country. However, in these cultures you don't need the permission of the womans father to propose. So if you tell us where you are from it will help to picture the situation better.", "If they\u2019ve been together for 3 years and you haven\u2019t met him I\u2019m surprised he even bothered to ask you before he proposed", "YTA of course you are!  Telling her and taking away that special, surprise moment of a propoal was a \ud83c\udf46 move.

If he wanted her to know about it, he would've a) told her or b) proposed to her already. You took that chance away from him (the surprise element). Now, she'll always remember that you told her before she had the chance to have her surprise.", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m confused why you told her. He met with you alone and you seem to understand it was a surprise. Were you trying to embarrass him? Were you expecting her to be mad or sad and break it off? I get telling her after the proposal/engagement as a funny story. But I don\u2019t know what you were trying to accomplish by being like \u201cyour bf came to lunch to ask for your hand and he was so weird and awkward, haha\u201d What exactly was the goal other than to shame this young man and prevent the proposal.", "YTA", "YTA why would you ruin this for her and not just leave it at I met your bf", "ESH \n\n\nEveryone seems to be ignoring how weird the guy was. I dated my husband for 3+ years before marriage. He was at every family holiday, regularly spending time with my family, called Uncle by my brother's kids, etc. There is no way in hell I would have been okay with him talking to my parents before proposing.\n\n\nSo, the question is why did OP tell? Everyone's saying he's an AH for ruining the \"secret,\" but I'm not sure that's true. She hadn't introduced them for a reason, whatever that reason was......OP is right that this isn't what she wanted and she had the right to know that her boyfriend engaged in this antiquated tradition behind her back. \n\n\nAs a couple together for 3 years, did they never talk about why he hadn't met her family? How she ever planned to do it? Talk about proposals?", "Yta don't tell ne you didn't know what you were doing", "NAH.  Poor guy. And poor you - you are not clairvoyant after all", "There could be missing missing reasons as to why she didn't want to introduce her boyfriend to her parents.

So, either the daughter has a good relationship with her parents, and then it's weird that they haven't met, or she doesn't, and it's really weird that he's choosing to ask permission to marry her. Either way that seems like a red flag for someone, not sure who.", "Well either he's one of those people who moves too fast. If you haven't met each others parents (unless they are many miles away, which clearly isn't the case) then that is too soon to be getting married. \n\nIf she has been deliberately keeping him away from them, for whatever reason, then he should know her well enough to know that asking her Father for permission is not the way to go about things. So either way, he doesn't sound her well enough to be getting married.", "I'm beginning to think, though it could be the fact she doesn't want him to be exposed to her parents and not the other way around here..", "Not a red flag is you dint have a good relationship with your parents", "Or how awful her family is. It isn't always the partner that's the issue!!", "> but has been hiding it the entirety of their relationship. \n\nShe hasn't been hiding it.

I'm from Wyoming originally so pretty much a privileged white man with a family.", "That part was pretty much implied, yes.", "It's such a ridiculous, outdated tradition. The only person whose permission a partner needs is from their partner, the one they intend to marry. \n\nMy favorite quote is \"Tradition is just stupidity repeated.\" And it keeps holding up as true. TA here is tradition and this weird outdated thought that the parents somehow \"own\" the daughter and only with their blessing can she marry...how absurd.", "He was probably very nervous.

I don't like him.  I don't like the way he approached me.

So he didn't need to be clairvoyant.", "I see, makes more sense now. Still really odd that the first time you meet is when he is proposing. This being said, you shouldn\u2019t have spoiled the secret LOL. Sorry, YTA. Also, I might try to sound a little more interested in knowing the person my daughter is dating before it gets to this point.", "Yeaaaah the fact they have been together for 3 years ans you haven\u2019t met him is weird! Do they live far away\u2026 even then, I was long distance with my partner and he met my parents on FaceTime and then in person after 2 years when we could afford it. \n\nYou could have done this better and asked why they haven\u2019t met him yet and if it is serious. Would have been more insightful and open conversation. Shouldn\u2019t have said he asked for permission but technically you haven\u2019t ruined the proposal as you/your daughter don\u2019t know when or how he will propose, so she will still be surprised. Though now she is expecting it. \n\nMay be controversial but going ESH: \n\n1. Boyfriend didn\u2019t think to discuss meeting GFs parents before ringing out of the blue to meet up and then asking you re marrying her\n2. You didn\u2019t even ask neither him nor your daughter why they hadn\u2019t met yet and feels like an appropriate time to ask after 3 years\n3. You could left out the proposal when talking to your daughter and and instead discussed why you haven\u2019t met her boyfriend\n4.

It may not be something with him....", "I think we can guess that she chose not to introduce him to you because the fact that you're an AH might have frightened him off.", "He didn\u2019t tell her because it was supposed to be a surprise. The stranger in question was his girlfriends father. The mother could have been asked too, but traditionally, it is the father you ask the permision of. The kid was most likely terrified of the encounter and of possible rejection. That could be because he has social anxiety or just loves his girl and wants to marry her. He isn\u2019t a moron.", "But then he chose to contact them out of the blue regarding marrying her? So, she's never conveyed any of these issues to her boyfriend?", "He's a bumbling fool.", "So?", "ESH. You should have let them have their surprise. However, I think it\u2019s odd all around that this was his first time meeting you. Had he met your wife? It depends on your daughter, but if someone asked for \u201cmy permission\u201d to marry my daughter, I would say no. My daughter is an adult, & anyone who knows her well enough to want to marry her should already know how much she & our whole family hate the idea that someone would need a woman\u2019s parents\u2019 \u201cpermission\u201d to marry her.  Their blessing would be okay, but who she marries is her decision, not her parents\u2019.", "NTA rather concerning he has jumped straight into asking your permission to propose, before he even got an introduction to her parents. It maybe that she was not ready for a proposal because she hadn't even got to the stage of introducing him to her family. I feel like he has jumped the gun contacting parents he hasn't been introduced to. I'd be pissed if I was her.", "Welllll, honestly, my knee jerk reaction was to name you as the problem but then I realized there's enough errors to go around to everyone. The boyfriend should have just said he wanted a chance to get to know you without telling you about the proposal. Which brings us to the next possible person who could have handled this relationship better and that's your daughter. If she'd been more forthcoming to you and your wife about the seriousness about the relationship and had him over to the house this wouldn't have blindsided anyone. And yes, you were wrong to tell her about the proposal but since it seems her first reaction was mortification, she might have appreciated the advance notice so she could be prepared to gently turn him down or find a way to let him know the relationship was still in the early stages.  ESH", "ESH\n\nYou shouldn't have told your daughter\nBUT when this guy asked to marry your daughter you should have been more upfront and said\n\"We'd like to get to know you better first\"\nNot \"sure if you want to\" then ruin the proposal.\n Honestly OP it seems you were just as unprepared as this guy was....\n\nIdk y you're just meeting this guy now after 3 years but i think you need to be closer with your daughter......", "NTA. Your daughter's life must be close to perfect if her nose got out of joint over trivial BS like that.", "YTA for ruining the surprise. \n\nYou should have kept your mouth shut.", "This is giving me Netflix \"You People\" vibes. Not going to make a judgment because you could argue different ones.", "NTA and you're all crazy. You do NOT ask for parent's blessing at the first meeting. Holy shit that's insane.  Build a relationship first. I know some people consider it an old fashioned custom, but if you're going to do it at all you shouldn't do it like this. If OP had known the boyfriend for a while before hand, maybe he wouldn't have been so quick to spill the beans. \"oh hey I met your boyfriend\" understandably led to \"took me to lunch and asked if he could marry you\". Of course he told his daughter about his meeting with her boyfriend. Cut OP some slack. At worst this is ESH and I'd say it's mostly daughter and her boyfriend who are at fault.", "Yes, yes you are", "YTA", "OP said they knew it was supposed to be a surprise for his daughter.", "Right? And why was she upset? Because boyfriend overstepped and took it upon himself to meet dad? Or because she was being blindsided with a proposal? It wasn\u2019t the ruined surprise at first.. that came later..\n\nSounds like her and her dad have a decent relationship if they were at dinner the same night? \n\nI can\u2019t decide who is the AH in this without more info:\n1) \u201coblivious\u201d dad?\n2) overzealous boyfriend?\nOr 3) secretive daughter", "YTA you know you don\u2019t give information like that away", "YTA of course you are!

That would make this make sense", "I really don't get the overwhelming Y T A. Ruining a surprise sucks, but if you think someone wouldn't want that, he needed to think about his daughter's feelings over this guy's...and maybe he was wrong, but he thought that she deserved to know that he secretly went to her dad, when she had spent 3 years making sure they didn't meet.", "Yeah like it seems they were all just very unprepared and it wrecked.", "The daughter had SOME reason to not introduce them. Whether it was an issue with the bf or an issue with the parents, he still took it upon himself to introduce himself to her parents without her knowledge.", "To ask them for permission to marry her. As you read up there, the daughter wasn\u2019t upset that he introduced himself, she was upset because the dad ruined her surprise.", "It says that her initial reaction was mortification because she had a plan to introduce them. \n\n\nShe could hate that he did this with that being overpowered by wanting to get married."]}
