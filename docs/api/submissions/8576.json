If OP had known the boyfriend for a while before hand, maybe he wouldn't have been so quick to spill the beans. \"oh hey I met your boyfriend\" understandably led to \"took me to lunch and asked if he could marry you\".

You could have just simply told her that you'd met him for the first time and that you were surprised by how serious he was in the relationship despite you never having met him previously, that would probably have gotten you everything that needed from her without ruining the surprise of something that's pretty commonly known of as a big surprise.", "YTA.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter was first mortified and then she Stockholm Syndrome-d herself into future engagement.\n\nShe could enjoy the surprise of it happening when/if he asks her.

Marriage is not a series of grand gestures, life is not a romantic comedy. Marriage is serious, engagement is not supposed to be a complex trap, scheme or riddle.\n\nTwo of them sound young and inexperienced and not so harmonious as a couple.

But your point is a good one \u2014 there\u2019s a red flag here somewhere, just not sure for who.", "I agree with you about the communication. It's possible the couple has talked about getting married broadly but the daughter wouldn't know \"ah yes a proposal is imminent\" without OP spilling the beans.", "Then how could you possibly think this is anything other than a YTA situation?", "Ok but if your family is awful don\u2019t you think you\u2019d tell your boyfriend of 3 years that information? And in that case why would boyfriend ask your \u201cawful\u201d family for permission to marry? \n\nNone of it makes sense.", "Yea, \"ruining a suprise\" could be an AH move, but it sounds like OP just wanted to let his daughter know that her boyfriend did this. It sounds like she wasn't happy he did it, but then that was overpowered after by thoughts of being engaged.\n\n\nI wonder how it would have gone down if OP hadn't told. She would have set up a meeting between her fiance and her parents, to introduce/announce engagement and he'd be like \"Oh yea, we met. We already know about the engagement\". Or lie forever? \n\n\n\nOne of the MANY reasons I wouldn't have wanted my partner to ask my parents for permission/blessing/whatever, is how excited I was to tell them I was engaged. I wanted it to be about my partner and me, and then share that news together.", "hi grandperson! thanks for the advice :)", "I agree, however that should be the duty of the proposer. The person who is getting proposed to should know that it\u2019s happening at some point, but their father shouldn\u2019t be the one telling them.", ">my first impression of him is he's awkward, old fashioned and afraid of everything.\n\nBased on your description of him, you sound like you have your own issues to deal with, and you sound like one of those toxically masculine types.", "Right?!", "Lots of people uphold traditions, even if their partner's family sucks.", "Partial comment stolen from: /u/elsie78 \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10o2dkh/aita_for_spoiling_my_daugthers_proposal/j6cc6h6/\n\nBot Reported.", "I think we know why the daughter hasn't introduced them yet now", "Wait, are they together for 3 years?! This makes it all even worse. \n\nShe is not sure about this guy, and from the looks of it, she's right. Or she is not being transparent enough about what she wants and should step up and tell him how it is for her, because it doesnt look like they are at the same \"level\" of seriousness or see life (goals) same way.", "She may not have spoken about it or the bf may have some mental health condition that makes it difficult to meet new people or leave the house. His daughter doesn't seem upset the bf wants to propose just that the suprise was ruined."]}
