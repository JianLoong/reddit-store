He said that his wife was only trying to do what she thought was best for me, and that the only issue is that what she thought is best is different from what I thought is best. My dad said I should take that into consideration and also humour her by 'giving up those books' since she would become a new parental figure for me if I keep up the visits. I asked if he expects me to do what she wants, including when I'm not at their house, and he sheepishly said yes. So I told him that I won't be visiting again.

As I\u2019m part of the LGBTQ community I\u2019m even offended by her actions. Reading a book with a protagonist who\u2019s bi is not gonna turn anyone\u2019s sexual orientation around.

I get that your dad feels threatened by this but you\u2019re well within your rights if you ask me. Yes, it\u2019s also her home, but it\u2019s your reading material and it doesn\u2019t directly affect her. She\u2019s out of line here pushing her anti LGBTQ opinions onto you. Sorry she\u2019s being so shitty about a book. Sorry it\u2019s putting a strain on the relationship you\u2019re trying to have with your dad. It\u2019s just not her place to decide what you read or don\u2019t. Even given the history I\u2019d say your dad\u2019s say in it is limited. As long as your mom approves that book\u2026 and even at 16 you\u2019re probably old enough to choose for yourself entirely. You could have been a bit more tactful to your dad in your phrasing but I do agree you should make it clear you don\u2019t take shit from someone who is basically a stranger to you and has no say over you. I would have done the exact same thing at that age, no doubt about it! Just next time be a bit more subtle. Like: dad I get she\u2019s your wife and I respect it\u2019s her home and all but she shouldn\u2019t decide what I\u2019m reading because she\u2019s not my mother.

As she\u2019s living with you that\u2019s gonna make it hard for us to spend time together and I\u2019d hate that, but I\u2019m not gonna listen to her. Sorry dad. Please understand. Something like that. But it doesn\u2019t make you an AH. Just someone who\u2019s not afraid to stand up for themselves and that\u2019s a quality that\u2019ll help you in life. Because sometimes no one else will if you don\u2019t. Just try to realise you can stand up for yourself and still respect the other person. Maybe work on a compromise where you agree to respect your dad\u2019s wife and she agrees not to act like your stepmother. I also think she\u2019s rather young to even try to be a stepmother to you.

There was a news clip of boxes in the hallways at schools and a guy held up several books and The Very Hungry Caterpillar was one of them, this was during the same \"transition\" story so I likely thought it was due to the transitioning and that has stuck with me.
