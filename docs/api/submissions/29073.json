Your dad completely blew it. What a ridiculous hill for him to die on. Someone barely older than you trying to decide what books are appropriate? Laughable.", "NTA. She's not your mom, and he lost his legal rights. \n\n>He said what I said was threatening him.\n\nDon't let him play the victim. This isn't a threat as no harm will come to him regardless of the outcome. \n\nHis wife is displaying bigoted behavior, stick to your guns. All she has to do is say nothing about your book. Should be easy enough.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA.\n\nDad and his wife doesn't need to be in your life if they're that dumb. Also ask her, how come with an over abundance of \"straight\" books and media for however long its been, there are still gay people.

You most certainly are entitled to select your own leisure reading material.  *Catcher in the Rye, Lord of the Flies* and *Song of Solomon* are typical required reading for high school sophomores.

This is literally like me trying to tell you what you can read.", "I can only go off of the words you gave us. \n\nBased on those words she made a recommendation and did not censor you. \n\nYour response was sassy. \n\nYour father told you not to be rude. Which you were. \n\nYou set a boundary with dad regarding censorship. \n\nHe took it as a threat. Which would not be healthy. \n\nLots of tweaks in the communication could help.", "NTA\n\nThreatening him?  No. Not even close.", "NTA. He was on thin ice and took a hammer to it for his wife. He's shown where his priorities lie, they aren't in a relationship with you.\n\nThe only reason his wife would know the LGBT themes is if she'd read the book or researched it, I've read the back cover on Goodreads and it doesn't even allude to LGBT. It's more about hyping that old characters from the Percy Jacksonverse are coming back and reinterating the premise of the Trials of Apollo series.", "Easy NTA.", "NTA - Your father abandoned you. Sounds like it\u2019s time to reciprocate.  Your dad\u2019s wife has absolutely no rights or say in this matter. Stay with mom and enjoy your book.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

At least you have one good parent. Hug your mom tight. I can't put into words how lucky you are to have her.", "NTA. Come on! That's not a threat; it's a promise!\n\nApparently he's willing to let his wife make his parenting choices, and she's choosing to be the evil stepmother.

She clearly has a homophobia problem, but that\u2019s not your problem. I don\u2019t think your response was rude at all. You are correct, she is in NO WAY your parent and has no right trying to dictate what you read. I\u2019m proud of you for reading and I\u2019m proud of you for setting your own boundaries, even though they feel complicated sometimes.", "Besides, you didn't \"threaten\" your dad. You made him a promise. Big difference.", "Their response was appropriate and warranted. You are spilting hairs. Telling a kid they shouldn't read a book with a queer protagonist has the same desired end goal as snatching the book away and throwing it into a fire.", "It's a boundary, and a very clear one.  He chose to ignore it, so she removed herself from the situation.  \n\nNow he's playing victim in attempt to manipulate her but he overplayed his hand."]}
