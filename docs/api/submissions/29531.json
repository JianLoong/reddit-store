My husband (30M) has a younger brother (28M) who is very, very kind and sweet, and he's got a bit of a shy-puppy demeanor to him, which is really endearing. The only problem is that my BIL has a rather angry RBF. His eyebrows are always furrowed, even when he's smiling, and his neutral face has him looking pissed off and unapproachable.\n\n\nDuring the wedding reception, I was sitting at the table with my husband and his+my family members, and my BIL was sitting across from me. He was just sitting there, looking angry as fuck as usual lol, but I know that that's just his normal expression. I thought to myself that the other guests may be kind of scared by his expression, and so I cheerfully told my BIL to \"turn that frown upside down!\" My BIL started smiling and he laughed, but then he fell right back into his RBF. So I reached across the table, and I said \"come on, now\" and I used my index fingers to force the corners of his mouth upwards. My BIL sort of freaked out, and he squirmed and pushed himself away from me.\n\n\nLater that night, while my husband and I were in bed together, after the first day of officially being a married couple, my husband brought up the little thing I tried to do with my BIL's mouth. He let me know that that was kind of weird, and it made him and his brother really uncomfortable. I told my husband that it was all just a joke, and it was nothing serious, but my husband got a bit incensed, and he bluntly told me \"one: don't touch my brother, two: that's just how he always looks, and there's nothing wrong with that, and three: don't touch my brother\". That shut me up real quick.\n\n\nAITA? I still feel as though it was all just a joke that everybody's overreacting about.", "created_utc": 1698093504, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17eugic/aita_for_making_fun_of_my_brotherinlaws_resting/", "score": 143, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't touch people without consent. You made a comment to which he laughed. So there, you demonstrated to the other guests at the table that he wasn't \"scary.\" Now leave him alone. \n\nAnd do not call it a \"joke\" because NO ONE was laughing at you bride-handling your BIL's mouth.", "YTA\n\n1) Don\u2019t touch people without permission. AH move. Duh. Why does that even need to be said?\n\n2) It was very condescending and rude. **Can you imagine someone doing that to you?** Most people would freak out - you\u2019re lucky you were the bride or he might\u2019ve slapped you.\n\n3) Even just saying turn that frown upside down when he\u2019s celebrating his brother\u2019s wedding is an AH move as that\u2019s something you tell a pouting 4 year old - not a grown ass man.\n\nYou should very sincerely apologize to your husband\u2019s brother. And NOT the *Sorry, I meant it as a joke* BS apology. \n\nMore like *I was way out of line at the wedding - I am so sorry that I made you feel uncomfortable. I way overstepped my boundaries and I promise never to do anything like that again.*", "YTA I would have slapped your hands away pretty damn hard if you'd put them on my face.\n\nYou basically did what women have been complaining about for years - told someone of the opposite sex they'd look prettier if they smiled. You made it extra weird by putting your hands on him.", "YTA.  It's like the old men who tell girls who are just minding their own business \"you should smile!\"  Don't be weird about someone's face and keep your hands to yourself.", "YTA. You were the moment you touched your BIL face and tried to force his mouth into a smile. The fact that you can't see how big of an AH it makes you touching someone like that without there permission is amazing.", "YTA He couldn't say anything much to you on your wedding day, but if you do that to anyone else again - or to him, again - expect a stronger reaction, and rightly so. You were bullying him.", "YTA. Who cares if your BIL has a RBF? Who does he hurt with it? Like your husband said - there is nothing wrong with it. And why does it bother you? It obviously does, otherwise you would not comment on it.\n\nIt might be one thing when you commented on it, but you crossed a line when you touched him. Touching people on the arm or back might be one thing, but the face or mouth is incredibly personal.\n\nAnd a joke is only a joke when both sides are laughing. Otherwise it is bullying. And \"you are overreacting\" is the common comeback bullies go to when called out on their actions.", "YTA\n\nThis is the same as when a guy tells a woman they should \u201csmile more\u201d\n\nBe honest, you were more upset that he might ruin your wedding photos by not looking \u201chappy\u201d enough", "YTA It's not a problem, and you shouldn't touch people without their consent, especially when rudely making fun of something they can't help. This reminds me of old men telling me to smile, you'll look prettier, as a young girl", "YTA, don't touch people without consent and don't expect people to always look happy", "YTA this is the same as dudes telling women \"cmon babe why don't you give me a smile, why you looking so serious\" and all that. is he supposed to be smiling literally all the time? he can't do shit about what his neutral face looks like so just leave him alone. and dont touch him", "YTA. You were being weird.", "YTA. Keep your hands to yourself.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s bizarre you\u2019re more worried about his facial expression at your wedding than anything else. You really had nothing better to do than belittle him?", "YTA. Seriously is there is something mentally wrong with you or were you drunk or something. You should know better not to touch people without their consent. Everyone should\u2019ve learned that when they were in school. Second thing, I\u2019m pretty sure you got annoyed when a old man told you to smile. So what makes right for you to do it.", "YTA, the phrase \u201cdon\u2019t touch someone without their consent\u201d doesn\u2019t just apply to sexual situations. This has the same vibe as those men that say things like \u201cyou\u2019d be way cuter if you smiled more\u201d do", "YTA. I would have been so upset if I was him. Hate people touching my face, as many would, and you\u2019re literally picking on how he looks which he can\u2019t help", "YTA. And your new husband already listed out exactly why. It was weird and invasive, especially in front of a group. Apologize next time you see BIL.", "YTA. The comment you made to him, that was fine. Touching him the way you did was weird.\n\nAlso, you already knows how he looks, you've said it multiple times in the post. Listen to your husband's 3 points. \n\nAlso, if the person you're \"joking\" with is uncomfortable, and doesn't laugh, they aren't getting your \"joke\" and you should either stop or apologize. Usually both.", "YTA.  If the roles were reversed would you want someone touching your face?  Your BIL probably laughed the first time just to be polite,  which shows his manners are better than yours.  Just accept that you made a mistake and apologize the next time that you see him. It doesn't have to be a big deal to rectify it.", "YTA and your husband is absolutely right.\n\nYou talk about how nice your BIL is and that is just how he looks, so you know he's not mad or anything along those lines. You created a narrative in your own mind that other people at the event probably were thinking he was angry even though from what you said, no one mentioned anything and then used that to not only poke fun at him for, as you said, how he naturally looks, but then cross the line into physically trying to force him to smile. You even said he looks angry when he smiles anyways so sounds like it wouldn't have solved anything anyways.\n\nTake the L, apologize to your BIL for crossing physical boundaries and teasing him, and then do something nice for him to show him how much you do appreciate him.", "YTA. 1. Don\u2019t touch people especially their face. That is extremely intrusive. 2. It is ridiculous to expect someone to sit with a fake smile on their face the whole time. Leave him alone. 3. You potentially hurt your relationship with your husband\u2019s family. If I were them I would keep you at a distance until you can demonstrate better judgment.", "I'd have broken your damn finger. Keep your mitts to yourself. And making comments on people's looks is rude as fuck. You embarrassed him and them embarrassed him AGAIN immediately. Wtf is wrong you? You're not funny your obnoxious and TA", "YTA it doesn\u2019t matter why. It doesn\u2019t matter who. Keep your hands to yourself. Don\u2019t touch anybody else without consent.", "YTA.  Do you know what causes a lot of \u201cresting bitch faces\u201d? Anxiety. (Tense facial muscles, furrowed brow, tight mouth- all classic anxiousness).  You know what ***doesn\u2019t*** help anxiety? Having attention drawn to it publicly.  You know what helps even less? Being prodded in the face.", "No one should tell anyone to smile, and touching made it even worse YTA", ">but my husband got a bit incensed, and he bluntly told me \"one: don't touch my brother, two: that's just how he always looks, and there's nothing wrong with that, and three: don't touch my brother\".\n\nHe summed that up pretty well. \n\nYTA", "YTA. I have RBF face and it's from years of abuse and trauma. To have someone put their hands on me would seriously freak me out. (The face is very sensitive.) Please don't touch people like that -- it's a major boundary violation.", "Yta- did your parents never teach you manners ? Why would you touch someone face without consent?", "YTA\n\nDon't \ud83d\udc4f touch \ud83d\udc4f people \ud83d\udc4f without \ud83d\udc4f consent \ud83d\udc4f", "YTA.

Don\u2019t touch people without their consent. And when someone tells you their behavior made them uncomfortable, then it\u2019s not a joke. Own your mistakes and apologize.", "YTA. You were rude and owe BIL an apology.", "YTA.\n\nAs someone who has angry RBF, you were way out of line. We go through life with people constantly demanding we smile, or asking why we're angry, or telling us to cheer up. We don't fucking need it from family, too. You're especially the asshole because you laid hands on him as well.", "YTA - you dont touch ppl without their permission especially their face.", "YTA", "God YTA how could you think that was okay to do to BIL", "YTA. Don't do that, seriously.", "YTA . You had no right to make fun of him, and you sure as heck had no right to put your hands on him.", "YTA.  Don\u2019t touch other people.  Joking or not.  Don\u2019t do it, it\u2019s creepy.", "In my experience the people who are very sweet and shy hate being talked down to the most", "YTA. You're like all those men who demand that women \"SMILE\".", "YTA.  Oh, no you didn't!   Not only did you do the \"Smile!\" bs, but then you actually touched him to force him to do what you want?    Just a joke?  No.  Keep your hands to yourself, you seriously overstepped.", "I hate people touching me, but more I hate people touching my face, but MORE, I hate people touching my mouth.", "YTA. If girls don't like being told about the RBF, *touching* a man because of his RBF is bad too. You were told you made someone uncomfortable and you doubled down that it was a joke. Who does that? Assholes.", "YTA. My four year old understands not to touch people without asking and definitely doesn\u2019t get handsy with someone\u2019s face. If he can comprehend that, surely to God you can as well. Bride or not, what you did was not cute or endearing or funny. You showed people you\u2019re an entitled ass. Expect to see the RBF from now on but know that he means it\n\nI hope this doesn\u2019t set the tone for the rest of your marriage.", "That's how he looks and that's fine, your now husband had to say it in a \"don't touch my brother\" sandwich. You made him feel uncomfortable maybe not only with the not-cool and not-consensual touching, but also with his face and appearance.\nYou don't get to decide if something you did affected someone else or not, they'll tell you, and what you did crossed a line with your brother in law and with your husband. To them it wasn't just a joke, regardless of your intentions. You should apologize and try to understand why this was so bad for them. YTA.", "If you have to explain that something is a joke then you did it wrong and it\u2019s not funny.

Your behavior and attitude makes you sound much younger than 30.\n\nI will also add that every person I\u2019ve met who worries or complains about RBF in others did so because of their own insecurities - they didn\u2019t have enough confidence in themselves to be comfortable without external \u201cproof\u201d that people liked them.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s completely anecdotal.", "YTA.\n\nHands to yourself.

Grow up.", "YTA - as a proud member of the RBF club, inherited from my father who looked angry and disapproving when he was relaxed, it gets so annoying when people feel your happiness isn't performative enough.

My husband (30M) has a younger brother (28M) who is very, very kind and sweet, and he's got a bit of a shy-puppy demeanor to him, which is really endearing. The only problem is that my BIL has a rather angry RBF. His eyebrows are always furrowed, even when he's smiling, and his neutral face has him looking pissed off and unapproachable.\n\n\nDuring the wedding reception, I was sitting at the table with my husband and his+my family members, and my BIL was sitting across from me. He was just sitting there, looking angry as fuck as usual lol, but I know that that's just his normal expression. I thought to myself that the other guests may be kind of scared by his expression, and so I cheerfully told my BIL to \"turn that frown upside down!\" My BIL started smiling and he laughed, but then he fell right back into his RBF. So I reached across the table, and I said \"come on, now\" and I used my index fingers to force the corners of his mouth upwards. My BIL sort of freaked out, and he squirmed and pushed himself away from me.\n\n\nLater that night, while my husband and I were in bed together, after the first day of officially being a married couple, my husband brought up the little thing I tried to do with my BIL's mouth. He let me know that that was kind of weird, and it made him and his brother really uncomfortable. I told my husband that it was all just a joke, and it was nothing serious, but my husband got a bit incensed, and he bluntly told me \"one: don't touch my brother, two: that's just how he always looks, and there's nothing wrong with that, and three: don't touch my brother\". That shut me up real quick.\n\n\nAITA? I still feel as though it was all just a joke that everybody's overreacting about.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Saying \"turn that frown upside\" and making your BIL laugh was fine. That is the point at which you should have stopped.\n\nYou have already said that your BIL is sweet and shy, so why would you embarrass him in front of your family and friends by manipulating his mouth into a smile? Your behaviour was disrespectful and childish. You are lucky he didn't slap your hands away or bite a finger or two.", "YTA.
