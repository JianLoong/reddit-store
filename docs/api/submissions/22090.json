I was going to post in TOMC, but now I feel bad about what went down today and need some honest input.\n\nI had my baby July 1st at exactly 33 weeks. My water ruptured early and she\u2019s been in the nicu since right after birth. I\u2019m incredibly grateful to all the doctors and nurses and everyone else there who has been helping not only my baby, but me as well. It\u2019s an experience I don\u2019t wish on anyone.\n\nSo, today I was sitting kind of in the corner of the area my daughter is in reading and I hear a nurse start talking about me to another nurse just outside the little room. I recognized her voice because she\u2019s been on my daughters care team daily and I\u2019ve seen and spoken with her numerous times. She was making comments on my age and how I was wearing a wedding band but the father never came around, this is why young girls shouldn\u2019t get pregnant, etc. She has NO idea of my current situation unless the social worker told her, which I highly doubt. I fake coughed so they knew that I was in with the baby and the conversation immediately ended.\n\nThis nurse, like I said, has been on my daughters care team almost everyday and she\u2019s been wonderful. She helped me when I was just learning how to pump breast milk, showed me how to change diapers, answers all my questions etc. But I was so upset by what she said that before I left the hospital tonight, I went to the nurses station and asked to speak to the lead nurse and told her what happened. She seemed truly shocked and apologetic and assured me that appropriate disciplinary actions would be taken.\n\nOnce I got back to my room, I felt really bad like maybe what she said wasn\u2019t THAT bad and I\u2019m just overly emotional. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1689229785, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ycx19/aita_for_filing_a_complain_on_my_daughters_nicu/", "score": 157, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What an awful thing to say. I'm glad you filed the complaint.", "NTA - even IF you were being overly emotional (which you have every right to be after having a baby, and in the NICU), she shouldn\u2019t be talking smack and adding her \u201copinion\u201d on her moral high ground. Because people with genuine moral compasses don\u2019t judge people they don\u2019t know!", "NTA. The nurse was completely unprofessional, out of line, and ethically dubious, given how vulnerable you and your baby are.\n\nShame on her, and I recommend following up with the head nurse regarding what actin is being taken, and what the outcome is. As your complaint is not in writing, you run the risk of it going nowhere. Just think of the other families you are protecting from this by making a complaint.", "NTA.\n\nGossiping about patients and family is outrageous, that's not part of the job. You didbthe right thing, she owes you an apology.", "NTA- I\u2019d go as far as to say you have a duty to report it. That behavior is unacceptable in the medical field. Also, what does she mean about, \u201cThis is why young people shouldn\u2019t get pregnant?\u201d Did she mean that because you were on your own or was she implying the early delivery was because of your marital status? Because that kind of judgmental nonsense will affect how she cares for future patients. Also, HIPPA is a thing. Discussing patient info out in the open is a pretty GIANT and well known no-no.", "\"This is why young girls shouldn't get pregnant\" is basically saying its your fault your baby was born premature! Your fault for being young!... It's absolutely disgusting!\n\nNTA! Nurses know better than to make such judgments about people but this one obviously didn't pay attention in class during training when they taught about judging people and how not to do it.\n\nYou have every right to make a complaint and it's a good thing you did bevause who knows how many other parents she's talked about and how many other parents have heard her and felt guilty and awful about it... Things like this affect mental health after giving birth when hormones and emotions are extremely high and fragile, made harder when babies are in NICU.\n\nHopefully she learns from this!", "NTA. Her comment about why young girls shouldn\u2019t get pregnant was uncalled for. \n\nEspecially at her place of work within earshot of other people/patients.", "NTA. You are free to not like how others talk about you. Using you as an example for their thoughts to another clinician without your permission was clearly a questionable and maybe rude thing to do. This is further evidenced by the fact that the conversation ended the moment you made your existence acknowledged.  \n\n\nYou didn't act out of line, you didn't blow up on anyone, you haven't really caused any harm. You have the right to feel how you feel, and act on that feeling in a reasonable way. Filing a complaint for that behavior is clearly reasonable.", "NTA You should definatly report that.", "NTA \n\nIf she hurt you with her commentary, you have the right to complain. \n\nTbh me personally, if I was so agitated to be taking an action  I would rather tell her to let me hear her comments to my face and go from there. But that's just my way of approaching this type of situation, honestly, I am the all-in or all-out type.", "NTA. It doesn't matter how good of a nurse she is, the issue is that she is being a judgemental gossip. Stuff like this can impact patient care, even if it isn't consciously done. And by gossiping about it, she is influencing how other nurses would treat you.\n\nWhat if it wasn't marital status, but a patient with scars on the inside of their elbow? If she gossips about what could cause those scars, she could get the patient falsely labeled a drug seeker and cause major issues for the patient. You did the right thing, and the reaction of the charge nurse confirms it.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t have reported, but it\u2019s up to you. I\u2019ve learned all of my life that people will judge so I just have a thick skin.\n\nBut I am curious, is your family not in the picture? You need a support system. Kinda also curious at your age because the system does work differently if you\u2019re a minor", "You should definitely report this. \n\nHowever if you only heard and didn\u2019t see them you should really only say what you heard, what time it happened and where you heard them talking such as what area of the hallway etc\n\nEven if you are pretty sure it was the voice of the one specific nurse. It\u2019s not uncommon for people to have such similar voices and even the way they talk that their own friends or coworkers mistake them for each other if they only hear the voice down the hall or over the phone. So you wouldn\u2019t want to accidentally get the wrong nurse in trouble in the event it isn\u2019t her. If you give all of the other info, then they should be able to figure out who it was accurately whether it is that nurse or not.\n\nSorry that it happened though", "Absolutely NTA\n\nThat is completely and utterly unacceptable behaviour on her part, and it needs to be addressed. Her personal opinions will colour her care and treatment of you and your baby, and it needs to be stopped. I'd go so far as to make written complaints.", "You and your daughter need to have people involved in her care that you trust.  Think about it, you are leaving your child in someone else's care.  You don't leave that to just anyone.  Honestly, she will probably get \"talked to\" by management and reminded to be professional.  She won't be fired or punished harshly, but she doesn't have to be your nurse.  \n\nNTA", "NTA - young mums would have a much easier time of it if the judgement stopped! \n\nCongrats on your baby and I wish you all the love and success for your future \n\nMy sisters friend got pregnant when she was 13 and had the baby when she was only just 14. Her parents fully supported her emotionally (and financially until she was working) but they didn\u2019t do any childcare, beyond babysitting once a week - her and the baby\u2019s father raised that child. She completed highschool, got a degree and is still with the baby\u2019s dad. They\u2019ve been fantastic parents! Their child is now 26 and he is engaged to be married, has a job he loves and is close to his parents and grandparents", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She doesn\u2019t know your circumstances, she has no clue who you are beyond the fact that you and your baby are there, and she most certainly has NO FREAKING RIGHT to pass judgements on you! What she did was highly unprofessional and reporting her was the right thing to do. Shame on her!", "NTA. You were right to report her. The nurse should be disciplined, and she should be ashamed of herself. This is coming from an RN. I am so sorry this happened to you. I honestly do not know why some otherwise capable and seemingly compassionate nurses feel free to judge others and gossip. That nurse doesn\u2019t know you. Even if she read your whole chart top to bottom, she doesn\u2019t know enough about you to make assumptions or pass judgements of any kind. I am 100 percent certain that she will not lose her job because you complained, but hopefully she will get the wake up call she deserves.", "NTA. She was highly inappropriate in her comments. I\u2019m a NICU nurse and never would say anything to shame a parents during that situation, it\u2019s disgusting and makes me mad you had to go through this. For the social worker, don\u2019t forget it\u2019s a big multidisciplinary team and social works notes are available to the team following you (including nurses), it makes it easier to help you and should not at any point be use to criticize you.", "NTA - she was unprofessional, judgemental and rude.", "NTA. You are in an incredibly delicate emotional, mental and physical state right now. You are relying heavily on the care ream to support you and your daughter. How can u trust someone on that team who made those kind of comments?", "NTA. She's a NICU nurse. She knows her patients are in the midst of a traumatic life event and that her shit talk will make it worse. She did it anyway. She's lucky you didn't give her a piece of your mind. If she wants to talk shit about her clients at work, she should work somewhere lower stakes, like a coffee shop.", "NTA SO MUCH NTA.\nSigned a former premature baby (24 weeks) who had a teenage mother.", "Damn girl I just skimmed thru your post history. I am glad you are safe, stay strong. \n\nNTA and you did the right thing by reporting her. There are some nurses who are absolute angels!! But unfortunately there are also many nurses who are more fixated on their own opinions and morals rather than focusing on a proper bedside manner for their patients. In my personal experience - those types of nurses actually have an negative impact on my treatment when I am in the ER (they legit sometimes won't even follow the \"recovery syllabus\" provided by my doctor because *they know better*) \n\nGossiping is petty and something you do with a pal at lunch break or over a beer and food after her shift is over. There's a time and place for everything. The fact she did it within earshot of a patient who's waiting for her newborn to freaking *survive* is appalling", "I'm going on a different track and say this, as someone who works in pediatric intensive care (not neonatal, but we're closely affiliated with them):\n\nWorkers gossip all the time. With how stressful the healthcare industry is these days, we need to find ways to reduce our stress during work and one of the things we do, unfortunately, is gossip about absolutely everything, including our patients. (we have a running joke that the best grapevine to hear juicy gossip is in the hospital - we all know each other in some degree or another and we know everyone's business) \n\nThat being said, we don't fucking gossip about our patients within fucking earshot of said patient and their relatives. That's an ombudsman complaint waiting to happen. If she has the balls to say it so close to your face then who knows what else she's willing to say or do. You were right to complain to the charge nurse. \n\nTo that end, NTA.", "Eh unpopular YTA ... Rude? Yes.... Out of line?  No... She's just venting to a coworker....", "NTA", "NTA\n\nWhat she said was entirely out of line and inappropriate and, frankly, it was *cruel*. The things she said were nasty and deserved reprimanding, you did the right thing by reporting it. I\u2019m so sorry you had to hear that BS on top of having a baby in NICU, a hope you both thrive!", "NTA. OP should have went higher up, like the CEO of the hospital.", "As do deadbeat dads (not saying OPs fianc\u00e9 is but I inferred that she may have also meant that)", "NTA AT ALL! \ud83d\udc9b If, after having time to think about it you still want her on your nursing team, you can go back and take to the head nurse and tell her all you want is an apology. She at least owes you that! If she receives any other disciplinary actions, that\u2019s a result of **her** actions, not yours.\n\nBut if you\u2019d rather not have her on your case any longer, that is 100% valid too! (and honestly probably what I would choose! lol) You, your situation, and your little one deserve an understanding and non-judgemental team to help you through this journey.", " If she wants to talk shit about her clients at work, she should work somewhere lower stakes, like a coffee shop.", "In front of the patient lol..."]}
