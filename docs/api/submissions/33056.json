I told him I was as today happens to be our son\u2019s 2nd birthday. We had his bday party over the weekend, so we were just celebrating today as a family. Tonight is also my husband\u2019s work holiday party. We have two kiddos and it was assumed on his part to be a family event and we agreed to attend. Turns out, it was adults only. He told me he didn\u2019t want to attend if the kids couldn\u2019t go. I never thought anything of it again. We decided that instead we\u2019d take the kids to the trampoline park. \n\nHe text me as he was getting off work and said \u201cyou don\u2019t work tonight, right?\u201d - I knew immediately he wanted to attend the holiday party alone but he didn\u2019t come right out and say it. He came home, said he didn\u2019t want dinner and when I mentioned the trampoline park, he got upset and irritated. He had a 6pm phone call anyway with our neighborhood HOA and used that as the excuse for not wanting to go the trampoline park. \n\n I finally said \u201cforget it, we can stay in and do a game with our oldest.\u201d After his phone call, he says \u201chey that party goes until 9pm, do you mind if I go for 30 minutes and then I\u2019ll help you get the kids to bed?\u201d I responded and said \u201cyou aren\u2019t going to drive all that way to stay for 30 minutes. Plus, I\u2019m not keeping the kids up until 9pm waiting on your help. If you want to go, then go.\u201d\n\nHe got upset with me and was mumbling under his breath as he had already gotten dressed in his motorcycle attire as he loves the attention of riding his bike. Mind you, it\u2019s 35\u00b0 right now. I was like \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re upset, I told you to go.\u201d And he was like \u201cbecause you\u2019re mad that I was gonna go, so now I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\nI feel like I\u2019m just a babysitter. He gets the freedom to do things he wants to do, and since he doesn\u2019t want to pay for a babysitter so I can join him on things, he gets mad when I\u2019m irritated.

It\u2019s time for the talk. You need to sit down and discuss this stuff. I would not have changed the plans, I would have dragged his ass to the trampoline park.", "Since you couldn\u2019t applaud him he was going to fault you for questioning any of it.

You are NTA. But he is here. You need to have a real conversation because this is not going to get better on its own. Consider talking without blame.   Because he obviously did not want to spend your child's birthday with your child.  And he wanted to go to this office party even though he told you he didn't.  Something is missing here.", "My dad often tells the story of how, early in his career, he was working long nights (frequently weekends as well) while my mom was home with me, and pregnant with my brother. (This was back in the 70s.) \n\nShe was after him to spend more time at home but he was doing Important Research and wasn't yet tenured and he kept *intending* to spend more time at home but.... \n\nApparently one day she met him at the door at about 11 pm, coming home after a particularly long night at work, and told him, \"If you can't spend more time with your family, I'm leaving.\" \n\nShe absolutely meant it, too. She wanted her kids to have a father, and not just a provider. \n\nAnd my dad took it to heart. He didn't necessarily stop working late completely, but he made sure he was home for dinner through bedtime, and yeah, sometimes he'd go work again after we were in bed, but not that often. (I have the *best* memories of dad reading to me as a kid through to my teenage years.) \n\nHe was always grateful to my mom for just laying it all on the line way back then, because it's *so* easy to put things off, to say \"Well, the kids are so *little*, they won't remember...\" and to tell yourself you'll get around to being a good dad *soon*. Because there's always a *little* more to do, that next project, the last grant, and before you know it, you're the absentee father and husband.  \n\nMy dad (now in his 80s, very much at the top of his field *and* very close with both of his adult kids and his grandkids, and with a long, incredible partnership with my mom) has told this story to a lot of his students and younger colleagues who've asked him for career guidance. He realized that he had to *choose* to make his family a priority, and early on, he wasn't doing it, and my mom had to force the decision - and often, that back-burnering of family was what he saw happening with younger colleagues as well. \n\nSo he would always tell them, Work doesn't care about your family; *you* have to, and caring about family is important. It is *worthwhile*. And he's gotten some incredible feedback from those younger colleagues, who are so grateful that someone they looked up to told them that while work was important, *so was family*. \n\nMaybe your husband needs to hear some version of that right now. Your son is 2; your husband is probably telling himself \"Oh, he won't remember,\" and telling himself *well, I'll be there for him next time*, and then next time it'll be *well will he really remember? 3 isn't that important, wait for 4...* and it will keep going like that until at some point he's missed the window and has become mostly just a provider rather than a dad. \n\nIf he actually doesn't enjoy spending time with his child, that's a whole other matter, but my guess - or my hope, I suppose - is that he's just thinking that he can put off being a *good dad* for a little while and focus more on work. (And maybe he hasn't spent enough time with his kid to realize that he actually enjoys being together and being a dad.) \n\nI'm not saying you meet him at the door and threaten him with divorce, but he needs to be reminded that work is always gonna be there, but his kid is only going to grow up once. If he wants his kid to come to him with problems as a teenager, he has to lay that groundwork of trust and love *now*. If he wants to be a good dad, he can't start *later*. He needs to start *now.*", "Yeah, I\u2019m sorry.", "I told him if he wanted to go, then go. It\u2019s not my place to control him and tell him what to do. While I was irritated with his choice, ultimately it\u2019s his and he needed to make it. He wanted me to support him in bailing on us. And I neither supported him doing so or made a big fuss about how he should want to stay. Thanks for your input.", "This is perfect, you've laid it out with such compassion and I'm so glad your dad learned that lesson and you had him be there for you", "\u201cWhen you coming home dad?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know when\u201d But we\u2019ll get together then.
