My wife has 0 student loan. My parents agreed to pay off my loans so I can save on paying interest. My wife knew about these loans prior to marriage and understood I would need to pay my parents back. My wife now does not think it\u2019s fair she came with no student loans. I make around 6x more than my wife bc of my education. My wife thinks her parents are being punished for having paid off all her education (college and masters). My wife also points out her parents helped substantially in raising our two kids for the last 5 years (cooking, cleaning, taking the babies at night, live in babysitting, etc) while we work. I owe my parents 280k. Wife wants us to pay her parents 280k as well.\n\nEdit: Wife\u2019s parents paid around 200k of her education which we are not expected to pay back. Wife\u2019s parents are well off financially and do not need money. Wife parents love their daughter and wanted to help with the kids for free. But we paid them 1000 a month.\n\nEdit 2: In laws do not need or want the money for her education.

If we proceed with paying wife\u2019s parents for student loans, I am certain they won\u2019t spend a dime of it. They will likely leave it for our kids or eventually for us.

I\u2019m Asian and her reasoning makes sense to me, in how it feels unfair that her parents won\u2019t be repaid for their generosity whilst your parents will be repaid for being not as generous.

It is probably hard for her to know how much her parents are contributing and giving to your family, how much debt they saved you from by proactively offering to pay her school costs as a gift, and then watch as a significant chunk of your family resources go to your parents who apparently don\u2019t do as much for your family.

I wonder if there is an \"I''m just a bill on Capitol Hill\" thing to explain loans.", "> NTA but wife is.\n\nHearing the wife's motivation, I am reluctant to call her an asshole.  It sounds like it is motivated by guilt, so it might be a good idea to clear the idea with her first, and then sit down with her parents and talk it all out.  \n\nIt seems like they both have a good relationship with her folks, and if what OP says is true, I bet they would be 100% happy if they paid what OP's wife \"owes\" forward by setting up college funds for the kids, and contributing the monthly \"loan\" payments there.", "$50k a year at a private 4-year college will do it and depending on your major, net you a job making $75k.  MD could easily make $450k depending on specialty, experience, location.", "But her parents have contributed to his lifestyle while he was in school and residency and they\u2019ve provided money and free childcare for years. If we were to put pen to paper I\u2019d say it\u2019ll be close. \n\nLet\u2019s say 2 kids for 5 years of childcare would be about 3k a month (he\u2019s a doctor after all so he won\u2019t send the kids to budget daycare) so that\u2019s 180k in child care alone her parents have provided. Add the money they\u2019ve given them over the period while he was making chump change as resident and you\u2019ll see that her parents have contributed same or more to the family finances.", "It's a little odd to me that she has a degree that costs nearly as much as his does but there is such a large income disparity. What is her degree in?", "And see here I disagree. Opie pays them $1,000 a month for the care and the parents choose to turn the money back into the household. I don't expect that he expects them to do so but rather they do so because they can.\n\nBut at the same time they got married knowing that there was 280,000 in medical school debt. The only thing they're doing is changing their creditor. In fact, his parents making this offer is going to save them probably tens of thousands of dollars in interest fees. \n\nI could see him agreeing to paying her parents the amount of money they would save in interest fees. \n\nYet for me, at that point, if this is the bone of contention and sticking point in my marriage, I would simply say thanks but no thanks parents. I appreciate the offer but it's caused a snag in my relationship and I'd rather maintain the status quo that she had originally entered into marriage with.\n\nIf she has a problem with that my next conversation is about separating finances entirely and deciding whether or not I want to stay in a marriage with this person. The shitty part is co-parenting with someone after a situation like this is usually pretty terrible. I wish this problem would have come up before they had kids", "OP says she knew it was a loan. I\u2019d say based on her reaction she thought it was a gift not to be paid back (like her parents paying for her education) or the paying back meant taking care of the parents when they aged and were retired. \n\nBut since you seem to be stuck on the income part, how many kids he he give birth to? I\u2019d say that\u2019s worth about half his income (and divorce law seems to favor that view). \n\nI mean have you wondered that maybe the reasons she couldn\u2019t grow into her career is because they (both of them) decided to start a family prior to her going through the process of establishing herself? Is that not a sacrifice for the family?", "Can\u2019t believe you got downvoted for having a rational discussion to get to the heart of the issue.\n\nIf I was the wife, one of my concerns would be how freely my husband takes time, money, and care from my parents. Instead of gratitude, there\u2019s an entitlement to their help that he doesn\u2019t expect from his own parents", "He said 280K LEFT and one would assume he has been paying them back so it might have been more. How much does medical school cost in the US.", "Probably something really useful like children's literature of the Victorian era in all of the Commonwealth Nations except for England.", "But see the \u201cloan\u201d from his parents isn\u2019t taken now\u2026 it was prior to the wedding and OP hasn\u2019t paid a penny till now when his dad cannot earn money anymore. That is what makes me think it was a gift that turned into a loan just so OP can justify giving that kind of cash to his parents over his wife\u2019s objection. \n\nOP is leaving a lot of details out to make his wife look horrible. If this was indeed a loan with set timetable, set payment amount and maturity date I\u2019d love to see the loan agreement. \n\nAs the saying goes, there are no loans between family and friends, just gifts because so many people go NC with family members or lose friends over amounts way less than 280k", "Then his wife is quite possibly the most obtuse person alive, because only a monumentally obtuse person would confuse a loan with a gift. I cannot conceive of a reality where this dude told a woman he was about to marry about loans owed and not specify that they were going to be paid back.    \nAs for the birth part, is it your contention that OP owes his wife's parents 280k for giving birth to his two kids?    \nAs for the divorce part, either she recognizes that his debt is part of marital finances and it also becomes her debt, or she denies that it is part of marital finances and looks like a complete idiot.   \nBut again, where did OP state that they were getting divorced?   \nI mean I could have wondered, but I didn't. If she's this ignorant of how loans work, she's probably not very good at what her chosen vocation is.", "*I have 280k in medical school loans.*\nThat's what he said. I'm not from the US so I would know how much medical school costs but from watching Dave Ramsey the student loans usually range from 250k - 350k so OP's debts seems appropriate", "A loan is a written contact. I didn\u2019t see where OP said there\u2019s a contract with terms and pay period and what happens in case he defaults\u2026 etc. \n\nIf you really wanna get technical, without a loan agreement signed by both parties (his parents and OP), this whole thing would be viewed as a gift fortunately/unfortunately depending on the point of view.", "If both parties agree it's a loan, then it's a loan.", "According to a quick good search, any loan that isn\u2019t specified to be paid back within a year has to be written to be enforced (of course it depends from state to state). But, even if OP and his parents agree that the terms are what OP says they are, his income is not longer only his but part of the family income this he\u2019s entitled to half of the total family income. And to get to that half, he\u2019d have to divorce, otherwise he\u2019ll have a pissed off wife that will probably divorce him. \n\nBut we\u2019re getting way off topic here. OP fucked up with the message. Instead of saying he has to pay the loan back he should have said \u201cwe need to take care of my parents financially sooner than we thought. How do we go about that in the best possible way for us and for them\u201d. \n\nMind you, OP has already stated that they as a couple would take care of both sets of parents in their old age. So this \u201cloan\u201d payback will probably extend way beyond 280k depending on how long his parents will live and what medical issues they will have in the future."]}
