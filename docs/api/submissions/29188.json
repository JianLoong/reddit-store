My wife has 0 student loan. My parents agreed to pay off my loans so I can save on paying interest. My wife knew about these loans prior to marriage and understood I would need to pay my parents back. My wife now does not think it\u2019s fair she came with no student loans. I make around 6x more than my wife bc of my education. My wife thinks her parents are being punished for having paid off all her education (college and masters). My wife also points out her parents helped substantially in raising our two kids for the last 5 years (cooking, cleaning, taking the babies at night, live in babysitting, etc) while we work. I owe my parents 280k. Wife wants us to pay her parents 280k as well.\n\nEdit: Wife\u2019s parents paid around 200k of her education which we are not expected to pay back. Wife\u2019s parents are well off financially and do not need money. Wife parents love their daughter and wanted to help with the kids for free. But we paid them 1000 a month.\n\nEdit 2: In laws do not need or want the money for her education.

If we proceed with paying wife\u2019s parents for student loans, I am certain they won\u2019t spend a dime of it. They will likely leave it for our kids or eventually for us.

I\u2019m Asian and her reasoning makes sense to me, in how it feels unfair that her parents won\u2019t be repaid for their generosity whilst your parents will be repaid for being not as generous.

She just doesnt have loan to pay back to her parents therefore they dont get such money: I find it fishy shes keen to give away your money (guessing majority is your money if make 6x more) to her well-off parents when they dont need it, unless it\u2019s cultural for her to support her parents?", "You sighted \u201c cultural differences \u201c and I am ignorant in that view, as I too am from the states. \nWithout that reason though, this stance would raise a red flag for me. I\u2019m left wondering if this is a dealbreaker for her or you for that matter. While nobody here seems to be hurting for money from what I\u2019ve read, it a sizable amount of money that she wants for a perception of fairness that doesn\u2019t seem to exist.", "If her parents are expected to pay for her college in her culture, is she expected to provide for them or care for them when they're elderly? If they expect that and your parents don't they'll eventually get \"repaid\" but in a different way to your parents.", "I'm in a LCOL area, I just asked my buddy and he's paying 25k/yr for daycare for 3 kids. 190k/yr has got to be some rich people shit where the kids get picked up in a limo and taken to a private beach or something lol", "That sounds like that old \u201cbeing a sahm is worth xx dollars because you\u2019re a private chef, chauffeur, nurse, entertainer\u2026\u201d thing.", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with wanting to repay a gift like this, though. There\u2019s no legal obligation to because it was a gift, but it would be a really nice to thing to do, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with her wanting to do so (whether they reasonably can or should is more complex than that, I realize.)", "Yes. She\u2019s does not have to pay hers back.", "So if he owed the bank instead, he would have to pay her bank the same amount? OP\u2019s wife\u2019s agreement was for her parents to pay for her schooling. OP\u2019s agreement with his parents was for him to pay them back so he didn\u2019t pay as much interest. At the most, I could see him paying the 80k difference, minus the interest he would\u2019ve paid on that loan, but even that doesn\u2019t make sense.", "Why should he have to pay her parents back?  He\u2019s paying his parents back because it was a loan.  If his parents hadn\u2019t paid off the loans, he\u2019d still be paying back the bank/loans services.  He came into the marriage with those loans, meaning she\u2019s not responsible for contributing to them, and also won\u2019t take on any of the debt should the marriage end.  Considering he\u2019s making 6x her salary, it\u2019s unlikely him paying back these loans is coming out of her money or changing her lifestyle.  If she wants to pay back her parents, she should do it with her money, just like she\u2019d have to otherwise.  Instead it sounds like she wants to pay her parents back using his money.  \nAs for the child care issue, it\u2019s separate and if her parents want payment for helping with their kids that should be separate from anything to do with student loans/paying back for college and be split from both of them, but it sounds like she just wants him to give her parents $200k.  Which is ridiculous", "Who forced his parents to pay off his loan? Mind you, I agree that the wife in this case is off track, but none of the parents were forced. \n\nI think the issues in this relationship are deeper than this and with OP mentioning the income disparity I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it comes up for different things they want to do as a couple and he uses \u201chis money\u201d as leverage to get his way.", "It\u2019s absolutely an \u201cexcuse\u201d to not pay them their worth when they haven\u2019t asked for it, didn\u2019t ask prior, and they are grandparents caring for their grandchildren entirely by choice. They\u2019re also wealthy.\n\nOP and his wife are not some millionaires abusing part time interns for labor. \n\nThey\u2019re people who greatly appreciated and paid something at all for the volunteer help of the wife\u2019s very wealthy parents.", "This is a very individualistic view. There are a ton of cultures or family clusters where the grandparents watch their grandkids for free. Or some other elderly family relative. Expecting payment for those services would probably be insulting, because 'their worth' in their eyes is helping the next generation of their line succeed.", "What if shes getting her parents to save her such money for her if they are to divorce or something something? That would be clever lol", "The 190k is this dumb figure that people made up to overvalue stay-at-home parents. It\u2019s basically the salary of a chef, cleaner, and childcare provider combined, as if someone were doing each job 40 hours a week. It\u2019s truly dumbass shit.", "Ya, but that\u2019s her responsibility if she wants to do it.  It sounds like she just wants to pay it back using his money even though she\u2019s not paying anything on his loans.  These debts are from before the marriage and therefore belong to each of them individually, she can\u2019t just decide that he should be paying off hers.", "> I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with wanting to repay a gift like this, though.\n\nGiving them money back is not how you repay this kind of gift or favor. Its doing what the parents would want more or need later in life which is a solid positive place in their lives and a safety net should something bad happen to them.", "Then she can take her 1/6 th of the income and repay them to her heart\u2019s content.

If she pays $100 towards bills from her salary, then you pay $100 from yours. If you've been paying more coz you earn more, that stops. Equality goes all the way. Everything split right in the middle.

It strikes me that you may need to separate your finances somewhat. \n\nIt's difficult with incomes as disparate as yours, but her expecting you to pay her parents when they didn't contribute to *your* education at all is ridiculous. Tell her she's more than welcome to pay her parents 200k out of her own personal money, if she wants to repay what they put into her. \n\nI'm just wildly speculating here - but if her culture is of the 'parents give kids all the support but get supported later in return' variety, you probably want to start having conversations about what types of support are expected as your parents age.", "So why do you have to pay your parents back?", "What does she do if she paid 200k for college and makes 1/6th of you? Or do you make like 1million", "Sorry, I don\u2019t really understand what you mean. Bank loans and exact figures aren\u2019t my point. She wants to repay her parents\u2019 generosity. I find that quite nice. The method, amount, timeframe and terms is something they should discuss as a couple.", "\u201cWhy should he have to pay her parents back?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u201d, you mean. They\u2019re married with kids. They\u2019re a unit. OP is wants to pay his parents back he\u2019s legally obligated to, AND presumably because he wants to repay his parents for their generosity, kindness and support. I would assume she has those same feelings towards her parents and the money they laid out for her. \n\nMoney is complicated, so are relationships, especially when you throw in income disparity. If they want to maintain separate finances in this manner, that\u2019s a fine solution. Not the only one.\n\nI\u2019m not saying they \u201cshould\u201d do anything. I\u2019m saying it\u2019s not absurd that she would want to repay her parents for her schooling, even if it was a gift and there is no legal obligation to do so.

At all. \n\nShe wants to siphon off free money for her parents.\n\nBoth OP and his wife knew about the beneficial arrangement for the no interest loan payment to his parents. \n\nShe\u2019s spontaneously deciding to give her parents charity they haven\u2019t asked for. \n\nNo one forced his parents to do this kind thing and it has absolutely zero bearing on the situation she\u2019s forced here.", "Exactly! Key words: debts before the marriage", "Or they could discuss together and decide what\u2019s feasible for them going forward. A lot depends on the current state and setup of their finances. It\u2019s not about what\u2019s legally required, here, it\u2019s just discussions and decisions they should be having and making together as a unit, how they achieve shared goals etc. An option could certainly be that they each repay their own parents from their own incomes, though I generally do not favour that kind of arrangement as it makes income disparity between partners worse (often resulting in resentment longterm.) But it may work for them - depends on their salaries, personal inclinations, and a lot of other things.", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s one specific way to do things like that. If OP\u2019s wife were my spouse I\u2019d want to explore what her feelings were about it, what goals she were trying to meet, and what would be most important for her parents.", "Yes, one viable solution is to have her contribute a portion of her salary to repaying them. However if they finances/expenses are intermingled it\u2019s not as simple as that - they still need to talk about it.", "Exactly she should be responsible for half of the bill (2)", "My dad who is the income earner became ill and was forced into retirement early. They need the money.", "except, she only wants to do so because OP is paying back his parents...", "How are they being punished by not getting money back they willingly gave away years ago? OP said her parents and well off and his are struggling.... I'm so confused by your responses", "Because it should be his wife\u2019s generosity, not his.  They paid for HER schooling.  If she wants to be generous and pay it back, that\u2019s lovely of her to do.  It\u2019s not his responsibility to do so.", "They aren't being punished. That implies OP is purposely not giving them money as a corrective action against something they did wrong. No one is being punished.  His wife's parents might have buyers remorse regarding their daughter's loans, but if that's the case they need to talk with her about changing the agreement and working out a payment plan with her.  Either way, they don't \"deserve\" the same amount OP owes because they didn't spend that. Plus, OP says he paid them $1000 a month when they provided childcare so it's not like he's leeching off them either.", "Based on the comments from the OP, the financial situation of his patently drastically changed recently due to the breadwinner getting sick thus less income. There is way too many unknowns to this whole situation to make heads or tails of it. What if it was initially a gift and now changed into an interest free loan because his dad is sick and needs the money but didn\u2019t when the deal was struck?\n\nIf I take OPs initial post at face value then the wife is out of line. But I\u2019m a grown ass man with a wife and kids and I know that issues like this are never in a vacuum. What if she was the one that had to put her career on hold temporarily while they had the two small kids while he was free to pursue the field of his studies? That can be a big reason for the different in income right now. Or it could be that his degree is in STEM and hers isn\u2019t. We just don\u2019t know. \n\nAlso, OP has posted that her family has helped them a lot when money was an issue and seems that he\u2019s taking that for granted because \u201cthe in-laws are well off\u201d. \n\nAs I said in my initial comment, there are probably a lot of issues about how they handle the family money especially since he admits that there is a huge discrepancy on incomes.", "Yes, part of it does depends on how their finances are arranged, but it does seem like she wants him to pay off her \u201cdebts\u201d (although it was paid for as a gift).  It seems like she thinks it\u2019s \u201cfair\u201d to give her parents the same amount as he\u2019s repaying his parents, but who has college paid for by parents and who has to take out loans isn\u2019t fair.  It doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s opposed to helping out her parents or something like that if it\u2019s needed, he just doesn\u2019t agree with saying \u201clet\u2019s give your parents the same amount as I\u2019m paying back to mine\u201d", "You framed it wrong this isn't a loan repayment you are supporting your parents, you aren't going to suddenly stop once u reach 280k. You need to have a longer discussion with her, I think saying oh well I owe them for my education was an easy way out of a tough conversation. That's the vibe I'm getting anyway.", "That\u2019s a fair observation for them to explore, but I wouldn\u2019t discount the possibility that seeing OP start to repay his parents made her feel like she would like to do that, too. Heck this post even got me wondering if there\u2019s anything like this in my past I could \u201cpay back\u201d now.", "He says she makes 1/6th his salary, his student loans were $280k, and hers were $200k. Maybe she's feeling guilty about the terrible 'return on investment' her parents got in comparison. Or maybe having well-off parents meant she never struggled in life and is now trying to find some struggle for herself to have out of some vague sense of boredom with her life, iunno lol.", "It depends - could be that there is a pension but only kicks in at a certain age, so parents need money to bridge that gap", "It sounds like she feels guilty that she had her college education entirely funded, while OP is having to repay his. The way to appease her guilt is to give her parents money that they don\u2019t even want or need. They didn\u2019t even mention needing to have it paid back.  \n\nOP saying she felt it was \u201cunfair that she didn\u2019t have any student debts\u201d is very bizarre. Who wants debts? Maybe she meant \u201cI\u2019m annoyed that I don\u2019t have a logical excuse to give my parents free money\u201d?  \n\nPerhaps, she feels that OP paying his parents back makes her look bad?

Did she have to stay at home for 1-5 years because little kids? Did that impact her ability to get career started? Is she the one supposed to take days off when the kids are sick and need a parent to take care of them?\n\nHow are the chores split up? What was the help her parent provided when they were getting started as a couple and was it material or only time investment. \n\nThe way OP wants the issue to be addressed in a vacuum is a red flag as no decision in a marriage is made in a vacuum, especially not one that has a 280k price tag. \n\nAlso, is there a written contract of the \u201cloan\u201d to his parents? We don\u2019t know the term discussed or monthly payment or anything? If I was a betting man I\u2019d say they\u2019re headed for a big divorce bill and his higher income is about to get halved.", "It sounds like her parents paid for her school out of cultural obligations, so I took that to mean she felt guilty that that factor, which didn\u2019t apply to OP, benefited her and cost them so much.", "I have to assume if her parents were helping with the kids she didn't stay home. She probably is the one who stays home when they're sick though because if OP has a medical degree and is a doctor, him canceling on his patients for the day screws up a lot of peoples' schedules. \n\nYou and the wife both seem to misunderstand the nature of this loan. It pre-dates their marriage. It WOULD be to a bank or company and it would be wracking up more interest, if his parents hadn't paid it off to lower the interest. He owes that money. This is not a 'decision in a marriage.' If the parents were not involved, this would be an extremely clean-cut issue, because the loan would still be owed to the lender, so she wouldn't be on some \"parental equality\" nonsense.", "The loan to the bank predates the marriage. Loan with the parents doesn\u2019t and we don\u2019t have a written contract to validate it. OP stated in a comment that the financial circumstances for his parents have recently changed due to illness/injury of the breadwinner.\n\nThere\u2019s a saying, never loan money to family or friends cuz it\u2019s not a loan, it\u2019s a gift. We see exactly why in situations like this where there isn\u2019t a clear contract and there are no enforcements of the contract clearly spelled out. \n\nFurthermore, we don\u2019t know the ages of the parents and if this illness will permanently impact their financial situation. What happens when. After the 280k is paid back and his parents still need money? Does he cut them off at that time? \n\nAs I said, OP and people like you wanna look at this decision in a vacuum and it couldn\u2019t be further from that. There are way too many things that we don\u2019t know and the way the wife reacted to this \u201cloan repayment\u201d leads me to believe how financial decisions are made in that marriage has never been on equal footing because he tends to use his income as a trump card."]}
