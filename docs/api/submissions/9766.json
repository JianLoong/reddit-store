Obviously not applicable here, as isn't many other rule.\n\n\"Renting from me\" is a different thing than \"renting from me the right to live in the same house I live in\". In the first one I'd be the most by the book (with actual knowledge of liabilities and obligations, not just made up rules) landlord ever, the second I would personally never ever do.\n\nI also don't see any way I'm being rude here.

The post kinda made it seem like they bought a house together as a couple, and you were just there as a temporary guest until you moved into your own place. \n\nWith that being said, I recant my statement. As a roommate/tenant you do have a say as well. However, I do see where your brothers gf is coming from. Buying a house is a big accomplishment that not everyone will get to experience, so maybe her mom just wants to be around more right now to share and enjoy this moment with her daughter. I, too, think the newness and excitement will wear off soon, and she'll return to her weekly visits perhaps. \n\nAlso, with this being her mom and not just some random friend, it might not ever be well received by her if you try to restrict her mom from visiting.

Legally, as the house is in their names, you are getting zero equity during the time you live there, despite paying 1/3 and she is getting half, despite paying much less.\n\nIf you love your brother enough to put up with this, at a minimum the three of you need to have a house meeting where you discuss whether you are equal partners in the home or not, and how to manage long terms guests like her mother.\n\nIf it was me, however, I'd move out. No amount of money is worth feeling taken advantage of and unwanted in your own home, and you mention that you can afford to move out.", "NTA \n\nI think you\u2019re entirely right to say to brother and GF look this arrangement isn\u2019t working for me \n\nIf we can\u2019t agree to an arrangement about visitors - as they\u2019re coming too often and it\u2019s interfering with my enjoyment of the house - maybe your mom can take over my third of the rent and I will look elsewhere", "YTA.

So the OP should be cautious if trying to renegotiate.", "Unless her mom is going to start paying rent your comment is just rambling.  You don\u2019t buy a house and keep a tenant because it\u2019s easy for you to make your mortgage payments.", "Does it? So, then wouldn\u2019t all renters have the same claim of \u201cthis house is at much mine as yours\u201d to their landlords?", "Considering he pays 1/3rd of all their damn expenses INCLUDING the mortgage for the house. its just as much his home currently.", "Their home huh? Well then OP should stop paying 1/3rd of the MORTGAGE and utilities! After all if its THEIR home THEY should be paying for THEIR home's expenses.", "Not really-the rules are different when you live with your landlord and laws/rules typically don\u2019t apply", "I agree with you, i was just pointing out that OP is not a mooch.", "Spoken like a true landlord", "YTA it's not your house it's THIERS so you have no say who comes or goes in THEIR house.

It\u2019ll die off naturally. \n\nAsk yourself this, if you get a new partner would you expect them to visit whenever you wanted them to? If the answer to that is yes then you\u2019re being unreasonable. However if the answer is it would be an agreement between you and your brother and his girlfriend then you should talk to them. I suspect it\u2019s the former, not the latter, but I will not call you an AH for it.", "NTA but move out op for your mental peace.", "I wouldn't be making any waves. Yes you pay rent but you also don't own the house. Their house their rules. If you don't like the mom just be anti social in your room. When you venture out just make small talk or ignore her. Instead of having free reign over an apartment now you have a room and other shared common areas. Make no mistake. Your brother and his girlfriend are moving forward in their relationship.

OP is essentially a third wheel in their relationship and is likely not going to be prioritized in any way.", "Also if they bought the house the dynamic shifts.

Do you understand that this is even unfair to you money wise\n\nI don't understand. This is literally how renting works? Someone owns not because they pay a mortgage (which is usually similar or lower than rent), but because they pay a substantial enough down payment and the bank lent to them. \n\nIf he goes pay rent somewhere else (co rent with some other people) it'd be a similar situation. If he rents on his own then his expense would likely be higher. I'm not sure how it's unfair to OP unless he can own right now somewhere else.", "He pays rent.", "It's an issue now.  You're the third wheel, dude.   They don't want you there.     Time to move out.", "Agree it\u2019s time to move out. \nIt\u2019s their house their rules. Do you even have a tenant agreement ? You\u2019re a guest paying 1/3 mortgage. That\u2019s not right. It looks like they\u2019re taking advantage of you. And because you\u2019re used to that agreement you dont question it\u2026 but there is a big difference before you were all tenants. You were equals. Now you\u2019re a guest paying his share is the household expenses. you have less grounds to defend your boundaries. This is not your house. It\u2019s theirs. \nIt\u2019s time for you to find other roommates.", "Of course this is how renting works. But this proves that the setup is not on equal grounds. And it isn't. That's obvious. There are two homeowners (and landlords because of the arrangement) and one renting tenant.\n\nAnd obviously renting is not evil phenomenon or a bad thing. I'm not saying that.\n\nIt's just that there are three people now living in a same home/house/apartment, one of them being in a very unequal footing compared to the two others. That's the unfair part, I'd personally never be a willing participant in that arrangement in *either side* of the arrangement.\n\nMe hypothetically owning a condo and paying a mortgage for that and renting it forwards to someone is a very different story. No problem there.", "Immaterial.", "Your getting offended on OP's behalf, they're a tenant paying rent, I'm not saying they don't care about op but they're seemingly gearing up to start a family, that means that there's a big chance op is asked to find his own place and that's most definitely going to be pushed up to sooner if op starts nit picking who they invite to their home especially when there's no reason outside op just doesn't want people visiting that often also you act like them having to cover that shit would be some big deal, it's obvious that if they ask him to move out they're intending to take over those costs, hell as his brother they'll likely do so as soon as they ask op to find somewhere else and give op like 3 or 4 months to do so rent free so he can save up for moving", "Jesus Christ. Way to jump to a conclusion.", "I'm not offended. I'm saying that as someone who literally pays for 1/3rd of the mortgage and utilities he is allowed to want alone time in the house he lives in. Or at least to not have someone he barely knows there EVERY day. Even if he only paid rent he would still have a right to know if some person he barely knows is going to be there daily AND occupy the common entertainment spaces. The MIL literally does not need to be there every single day. She can watch TV at her own house."]}
