{"id": 25181, "submission_id": "15xaisg", "title": "WIBTA If I Told My Landlord About My Roommate's Husband?", "selftext": "I (18F) just started my freshman year of college last week. At my university, it is not mandatory that you live on campus the first year, and I did not want to live in a dorm, so my parents helped me apartment hunt. They mostly just gave me tips or helped when asked because they wanted me to pick what I thought would be best for me, since I'm ultimately going to be the one paying for the rent. I chose a place very close to campus (5-15 minute walk depending on which building you're heading to) and with great amenities in relation to my rent payment. It's not campus-owned, but it is exclusively marketed to students and has a questionnaire on the application for the purpose of placing you with your roommates that asks about your major, greek affiliation, clubs, etc.\n\nAnyway, I applied, got accepted, and got a letter two weeks prior to move-in with my apartment number, bedroom number, and the name/phone # of my new roomies for a 3-bed unit. We made a group chat and started to get to know each other. Layla (19F) is a sophomore, and Mina (23F) is a college super senior. I found out what they study, what they like, what they hate, what they're allergic to, their ground rules, etc. Everything seemed great. Then the day I move in I learn Mina is married. Her husband Kurt (25M) is nice, but he didn't leave. After a couple days I come to learn that he lives in the apartment with Mina. Definitely not what I was expecting and not what I signed up for. The apartment complex does not do co-ed living unless you and another person apply together for a 2-bed unit.\n\nI ended up asking Mina offhandedly where Kurt stays just to confirm, and she said he lives with her in her room. She asked me in a joking tone if I'd be \"hush hush\" about it because the leasing office doesn't know and this is the cheapest option for them with all the amenities they want until they get a house together, which  they're planning to purchase/finance in the spring when they're sure Mina is going to graduate. They're also apparently trying (or will start trying) for a baby because they're ready for a family.\n\nI'm upset and uncomfortable and I don't know what to do. I want to report Mina to the leasing office and get her removed, but I'm worried that even thought they're the ones breaking the rules that I might just be overreacting. I really don't like living with a grown man I don't know when I signed up to live with other girls, primarily in my age group. I was excited to move in with people that I wouldn't feel weird walking around in a sports bra and gym shorts, and being able to go to the fridge in the middle of the night for a snack in my underwear, and not having to lock the door every time I go in or leave my room, but I don't feel like I can do that with Kurt here. I've already caught him looking me up and down and I really don't want it to go past that and there be drama on top of all of this. Would I be the asshole if I just report the situation to my landlord?\n\nEDIT- I'll be talking to Layla tomorrow when we've got some time alone. Also I need to clarify something that seems to have been misunderstood. Mina and Kurt wouldn't be homeless, they would just have to move back in with their parents. When I said in my explanation they would have \"nowhere to go\" I meant that, as far as I know, they don't have relatives in town or a friend with an extra room. So Mina would likely have to switch her classes to online or take a gap semester or gap year before finishing her degree, that is if she can't find someone to stay with, IF she even gets removed from the apartment. Also, she and Kurt aren't \"broke college kids\". They both come relatively well-off families, I'm guessing, because they each have new, pretty expensive cars and no payments, and Mina has mentioned to me that she'll be graduating debt free and never had to take out a loan. This is all on top of the fact that Kurt has no job, which got confirmed to me like an hour ago, and they've both talked in front of me about how they'll be able to afford a 10k down-payment on a house in spring. They're also looking for home back in the city they're from which is far more expensive than buying a place in most of the rest of the state. Maybe I'm being a bit presumptuous, but I think they would've been able to financially handle moving into a different place. I'll update again tomorrow after talking to Layla.", "created_utc": 1692630894, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15xaisg/wibta_if_i_told_my_landlord_about_my_roommates/", "score": 1864, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, you and Layla are paying Kurt's rent.", "NTA\n\nThis doesn't fly for so many reasons. First, you're uncomfortable. Second, you're probably getting shafted on how the rent is getting split. Third, Mina didn't disclose this beforehand to get y'alls grace. Report her if you want.\n\nWhat does your other roommate think about this?", "NTA\n\nLiving with a married couple is not what you signed up for. Living with a male roommate is not what you signed up for. \nYou didn't even sign up to live with 3 other people. You chose this place based on the premise that you would have two roommates,  both of them women. \n\nReport away. It sucks for them but they are the ones who decided that it was ok to violate the terms of her tenancy and expected to magically get housed with TWO women who would be fine with an unexpected 4th roommate and with that roommate being a grown ass man.\n\nINFO- Have you told your parents about this situation? I don't know how your parents feel about interfering and fighting your battles but if you were my daughter,  I might very well take the decision out of your hands by raising hell with the leasing office myself.", "NTA!  That's super sketchy.  You shouldn't have to live with a 25yo stranger man after being tricked into the situation.", "NTA\n\nThat is not what the tenant rules or lease allows and was presented under false pretense.\n\nYou should not be forced to cohabitate with a random dude, especially when he's being a creeper", "NTA. Mina is going to think YTA, but you are definitely NTA. Its weird enough you don't get to pick who you are living, throwing a random dude in a single-sex apartment is unacceptable.", "NTA. Don't blame you for not wanting to have to worry about having a man in your apartment when he's not supposed to be there. I understand they're trying to save money, but they're also breaking the rules. You pretty much have three choices and that's either move out, deal with it, or report them.  They all suck in my opinion but you gotta do what's best for you.", "I'm going with NTA, because you chose to live in a single-sex apartment, and that's not what you got.

But this isn't appropriate she should know that other woman would feel uncomfortable.", "Nta can you tell the leasing office anonymously? At 18 living with a guy isn\u2019t fair when you looked for specifically female roommates.  I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable at that age, plus it isn\u2019t fair your paying the same amount but she\u2019s added an extra person.", "NTA. \nYou should report it. If they find out he's there and no one has said anything, you could all get thrown out. \n\nMina is definitely an AH for putting you in this situation in the first place.

My college senior son unfortunately signed a lease with another guy for a 3 bedroom place, another friend of the guy was supposed to move into the third bedroom but changed his mind. My son's roommate's mother (who visited the college for football games) said she'd pay \"a little extra\" for the third bedroom and she'd use it just for weekends. Turns out she MOVED INTO THAT BEDROOM, got a job at the university, and brought her 4 dogs (not allowed). My son protested but she and her son threatened him that they'd just ditch the apartment and leave him stuck with the lease. Since my son had a full load of classes plus a paid internship he was too stressed out to find another place to live so he sucked it up and just stayed in his bedroom most of the time. It was an awful experience.  OP at least you have your own lease and it is NOT your responsibility to protect the rule-breaking roommate.", "NTA. That's something she should have disclosed to you.\n\nMaybe you could try telling the leasing agent that you're not comfortable with your roommates, without specifying why, but if they won't move you without a reason then you wouldn't be an AH to tell them.\n\nGive your roommate a heads-up first. Tell her you're going to try to get moved, and that it's possible that the reason why will come up, although you'll try not to report her. That will give her time to make other arrangements.\n\nThey know they're doing something wrong, and that's not on you.", "NTA. Mina is breaking the rules and wants you all to be complicit. Report this situation to the housing department immediately so things can be sorted out as soon as possible. Mina and Kurt will have to find a new place", "NTA. I lived in a similar apartment in college. I say this in the nicest way possible\u2026 you are overthinking everything. \n\nFirst, the surveys are great but they ignore them the majority of the time. The hardest thing for freshman to learn is that your roomate isn\u2019t automatically your best friend. Sometimes they turn out to be and it\u2019s awesome. Sometimes they are the most aggravating person you\u2019ve ever met. Most of the times they\u2019re your buddy to events at the start of the year and then you drift apart but remain cordial as you each find your own clubs and friend groups. \n\nThis is important in your case because it doesn\u2019t seem like you knew Layla or Mina before this. In a week it\u2019s hard to tell the kind of person someone is. It\u2019s okay to bring up the situation casually to Layla but be prepared for her to tell Mina you mentioned it and possibly blame you if only Kurt gets kicked out. This situation isn\u2019t okay and needs to be resolved so I\u2019m not saying ignore the situation. Just be careful about who you pick to share it with. \n\nClasses are about to/have recently started so it\u2019s important to get this resolved now before your workload builds up. If you wait too long, there is also a possibility that the landlord will view you as an accomplice (because you knew and didn\u2019t come forward) which can affect your current lease/ability to renew for future terms. \n\nThe first thing you need to do is let your parents know. From what you\u2019ve said, they seem very supportive and they can help you navigate the situation. If they\u2019re a co-signer on the lease they may be able to handle a lot of the communication without your help so you can focus on school. It can also give you an excuse if Mina/Kurt say anything. (Aka blame your parents if needed to keep the apartment civil for you). \n\nThen send an email to whoever handles issues at the complex (probably a management company). Putting it in writing is important and you can copy your parents as well. Once that is sent, your parents can call for follow ups and to make sure the situation gets handled quickly (I say your parents because you don\u2019t want to be overheard by your roommates. Also, which it sucks, some management companies take calls from parents more seriously than from students). \n\nSome people might recommend taking to the front office. I would get the ball rolling through e-mail first. This is because many times, it\u2019s fellow students who have the front desk jobs. Since it\u2019s Mina\u2019s second year there and fifth year at the school, you don\u2019t know if the students at front know her.\n\nI\u2019d find ways to steer clear of Kurt until this is resolved. Lock the door to your room at all times. Many campuses have back to school events for freshman so go out and make some friends! They\u2019re usually lots of fun. \n\nBest of luck with everything!", "NTA!! Mina did a bad and deceptive thing. Not your fault. Definitely inform the landlord.", "NTA you should give her an ultimatum-move out or you report them. If they have an on-site caretaker or maintenance, I guarantee they will figure it out and they'll be evicted. Trying to rent with an eviction on your record is difficult. \n\n  Definitely talk to your other roommate about this. It will be better to present a united front.", "NTA. He's not on the lease, they're trying to get around the rules that keep people safe. Also it could be a fire code violation (my state has a one heartbeat per room rule unless the kids are under a certain age). Also, what if you don't say anything, she gets knocked up, then you've got a couple plus a new baby? Mina needs to leave and get her life straight. Go to the leasing office, and maybe ask for an inspection- say something is broken and you'd want maintenance to come look at it. Easy way to get off the hook if maintenance sees them. Then even if you do report it, they won't really know who did.", "NTA and you should definetely report Mina.  \nYou did everything right and applied to a place you would feel safe and have peace of mind while staying there and they are the ones breaking the rules and abussing the system.\n\nYou may end up looking at the \"bad person\" in their eyes but you are defenitely not, just take care of yourself and make sure you are happy with your living situation.", "Yeah as mentioned go ask for a different room. If ones not available & you report this extreme violation, I highly suggest you do so in the most discreet way you can. No you're not the or a asshole but you, if reported need to be as quite as possible.", "No, you would not be an asshole for reporting the situation. In fact - they need to know because if the leasing company finds out, and the fact that you didn\u2019t say anything, (it won\u2019t look good for you) you already mentioned how he was looking you up and down.. what else do you need? Turn them in and live the way it was supposed to be, without paying for a freeloader to live there\u2026 NTA", "YTA - When you get a roommate the expectation is that they'll potentially one day bring a partner home", "NAH. Nobody wants to see you in your underwear at night though, male or female. So please just put on a robe.", "Any time you make someone homeless when they have done you no harm, you're the asshole.\n\nThe appropriate thing to do if you're uncomfortable with having a man in your apartment is move out yourself.", "Nta but pretty sexist. You wouldn't lock your door around Mina but you would for her husband? That's a little weird. To me, but you are supposed to know with whom you're moving in and you didn't consent to this situation", "1: it's highly unlikely your roommate would be evicted, likely just given a warning.\n\n2. It will ruin your relationship with that roommate if not your other one, too\n\n3. If you should get a bf/gf and want them to stay the night, then be prepared to be reported \n\nIf Kurt is just minding his business then chill, if he gives you reason to feel uncomfortable then by all means report him but your roommate has the right to have a relationship and I certainly know of plenty of people in relationships that their SO technically has their own place but just never goes home and this is just one step removed from this.\n\nIt's inadvisable but technically allowable, but I'd say YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If I do decide to go this route, I think I'll need one or both of my parents with me, but I also really don't want to stress them out with all of this.

But I wouldn't be uncomfy if one of the girls accidentally saw me for a moment in a sports bra/tank top and boxer shorts/athletic shorts. \n\nTypically I would grab a robe anyway, because I still don't know if these girls would care at all about accidentally seeing a bit more thigh or some stomach.

I signed a lease and pay rent/utilities to live with two other college girls. I also didn't sign up to live with an infant, which is also potentially in my future since they're planning/trying for their first kid.", "A partner staying the night is allowed in the lease and I have 0 issue with it. Layla's bf visits every weekend and stays overnight on Saturdays. That's fine. Kurt LIVES in Mina's room, which is not allowed.\n\nThe rule for our place is one overnight guest per tenant, one night per week. I wouldn't care if one of them had two overnight guests or a bf over for two nights now and then instead of one. Not a huge deal. Kurt full on living there is a problem a huge lease violation that's been going on since Mina moved in a year ago. I think with that in mind, the office would take it more seriously and evict Mina. \n\nThe other issue is, as I said in the post, Kurt isn't really \"minding his business and chilling\". He's checking me out and making me uncomfortable.", "You would benefit from writing down the problem and what you want the final situation to look like. Maybe your preferred solution is that Mina & husband both move out while the less desirable option is that her husband no longer lives there but Mina still does. Next, practice saying what you think is necessary (obv. not in the apt). Not aggressively but in a matter of fact way. It'll give you the opportunity to hear how it sounds and more importantly, you'll get used to saying those words so when you sit with the office people, you're confident in what you're saying.\n\nGood luck!", "Ah, that makes sense.

Mina and Kurt are... and if Kurt's given you \"elevator eyes\" already, I can bet he's done the same thing to your other roommate... and possibly to other girls in the building. \n\nI can also guarantee that it's very hard to study while one of your roommates is constantly having sex, let alone actively trying for a baby. And if she gets pregnant/delivers? She's not graduating this year either. \n\nMina wants to make believe she's a grown up and all Adult\u2122\ufe0f, with her man and a baby... but she doesn't get to do any of that at your expense.

With email, you can add the landlord into the email so that the student in the office that sees it knows that they can\u2019t try to hide it for their buddy Mina. The possible downside is that if they are a friend of hers, they will tell her and open you up to retaliation from Mina. That is likely a risk that you will just have to take. When you make the complaint, add in that Mina told you they are actively trying for a child.

Let her know that you wanted to talk to her first and give her an option to fix this by either having him move out or they both do before talking to management about the situation but you do expect her to give you a solution within the next day or two and see it in action or else you\u2019ll just let management deal with it. I think that will be healthy because then you gave her a heads up and a chance so then if it comes to it and management kicks him out but let\u2019s her stay it\u2019s not as hostile.

Therefore I need you to either evict this couple and lease the room to a female roommate as was agreed in our lease or move me to a comparable apartment immediately.\n\nThank you for your help with this urgent safety issue. I\u2019d like to resolve this quietly without getting my parents and our family lawyer involved. Can I count on you to do the right thing?\u201d\n\nETA: also include a date when you expect the landlord to take action and state that you will call to follow up so they don\u2019t think that if they ignore you, you\u2019ll go away.

I dunno, maybe I've been living with roommates too long, but the gender of the additional roommate wouldn't be the deciding factor for me at all. I wouldn't trust new roommates just on the basis that they're new, and trust needs to be earned, but I wouldn't trust him less because he's a guy. \n\nI also just wouldn't trust these people at all because they lied to get you into a living situation to which you did not agree. That's gross. If she was married to a woman, it would still be just as big a problem, to me. I accept I'm apparently alone in my feelings that judging someone based on their demographics feels wrong, but eh, it's my truth. \n\nOne piece of advice I hope you do take away here is this - you keep pointing out he's an 'adult' man ... you're an adult, too. All your roommates are adults. You're equals. Sure, you're younger, but not that much. Don't look at this like you don't have agency or power here.

Also, not trying to troll, it just seems a little bit weird to me that somebody would be less comfortable depending on the gender of the roommate? I get that apparently I'm alone on this, but I have roomed with men and women before and I was not more trusting of a new female roommate than of a new male roommate?

They weren\u2019t technically living there full time but they would come often and would be at the apartment for weeks at a time which was a violation of the lease). I finally talked to my complex and they simply gave her a warning, and she proceeded to make my life a living hell to the point I broke my lease and moved out.

You\u2019re at an age of two very different paths: stand up for yourself or be a shrinking violet. There\u2019s a kind and a wrong way to do both, and you\u2019ve got some great suggestions here.\n\nPersonal anecdote, take it or leave it: I had the freshman privilege of scoring an apartment-dorm when I entered university. Four bedroom, two bath, right off of the astronomy building. I was stoked. There was one party heartily gal who had fascinating friends, a wallflower (I gave her her first smoke which felt horribly rebellious), a volleyball player who was as tall and gorgeous as the the day is long, and myself (a wee sorority gal with a penchant for sleep and whiskey). \nMy co-bathroom habitant started having her man be (and stay) over the day our parents moved us all in. He was fine, but certainly a drug dealer with an aroma of chemicals about and would only call himself after a country well known for, well, narcotics. Never gave a real first (much less a last) name. I honestly wasn\u2019t that bothered by his presence \u2018cause I\u2019m just gonna do me regardless of \u201ccompany\u201d.\n\nUntil. \n\nThat dude drank some of my whiskey in the communal fridge (we weren\u2019t permitted to have mini coolers so it was a spoken rule that if you put it in the communal kitchen, it was yours to use or clean up after. We were fierce with leftover pizza and had to draw these lines early). I bucked up (lol kinda) and went off. Not at anyone because I didn\u2019t know the culprit but yelled in the kitchen about moochers or thieves or something irrational. Got a text from an unknown number later that day from my roomie\u2019s BF saying how embarrassed he was, saying I terrified his long-legged goddess of a girlfriend- it was merely weak moment for him to imbibe, according to him.\n\nLesson learned: I approached my issue head-on but could have done so in a much, MUCH more productive way (15 years+ is 20/20 hindsight) than shouting into our dorm-void about someone drinking a 20mL of cheap whiskey. Anyway, I didn\u2019t realize how uncomfortable I was with him, and his ever-presence when I was trying to shower for class, until a bit later. I wish I had spoken to a resident assistant about this for guidance instead of fussing loudly at the electric stove. Roommate reported me for my hookah (rightfully so!) and we only spoke 2 or 3 more times the whole academic year. All very cautious interactions, which was super uncomfortable.\n\nMy take: at this age, sure you should consider retaliation. That\u2019s part of the acts becoming consequence lesson. But please, weigh heavily, that your comfort and wellbeing is worth so, so much more than the worry of any blowback. You\u2019re young and have so much ahead of you- don\u2019t let this couple causing you to be uncomfortable cast a rock on which you may stumble. Your third roomie probably shares a similar sentiment (I know mine AND the fourth roommate didn\u2019t like having our girl\u2019s BF around 24/7. Still didn\u2019t justify how I handled it but was a small comfort). \n\nTL;DR: Let your conscience be your guide in how to approach, but certainly approach.", "There's usually a lawyer (ombudsman?) you can talk to on campus for free. They won't handle anything student vs. student, so you would need to present it as you want the boyfriend out. Bring the contract/lease. At this point, you can speak in hypotheticals since the lawyer cannot represent one student against another. Usually, they handle students against a landlord. Ask generic questions like \"what are my options?\" \n\nDo you think the landlord or management company is aware of the situation? Do you see a lot of other male guests around the complex? Is there a curfew for guests to leave?\n\nMake sure you take some photos of his belongings when he's not around to show that he's a permanent resident instead of a guest.\n\nGood luck.", "Here\u2018s an idea: why don\u2018t you let your parents take the \u201ebad cop\u201c role? They should go to the landlord, being totally (fake) furious that their daughter is living with a man in this Apartment and they are NOT ok with this. This way you are not telling the landlord yourself and you will extremely likely get this resolved.
