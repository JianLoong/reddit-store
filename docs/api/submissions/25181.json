{"id": 25181, "submission_id": "15xaisg", "title": "WIBTA If I Told My Landlord About My Roommate's Husband?", "selftext": "I (18F) just started my freshman year of college last week. At my university, it is not mandatory that you live on campus the first year, and I did not want to live in a dorm, so my parents helped me apartment hunt. They mostly just gave me tips or helped when asked because they wanted me to pick what I thought would be best for me, since I'm ultimately going to be the one paying for the rent. I chose a place very close to campus (5-15 minute walk depending on which building you're heading to) and with great amenities in relation to my rent payment. It's not campus-owned, but it is exclusively marketed to students and has a questionnaire on the application for the purpose of placing you with your roommates that asks about your major, greek affiliation, clubs, etc.\n\nAnyway, I applied, got accepted, and got a letter two weeks prior to move-in with my apartment number, bedroom number, and the name/phone # of my new roomies for a 3-bed unit. We made a group chat and started to get to know each other. Layla (19F) is a sophomore, and Mina (23F) is a college super senior. I found out what they study, what they like, what they hate, what they're allergic to, their ground rules, etc. Everything seemed great. Then the day I move in I learn Mina is married. Her husband Kurt (25M) is nice, but he didn't leave. After a couple days I come to learn that he lives in the apartment with Mina. Definitely not what I was expecting and not what I signed up for. The apartment complex does not do co-ed living unless you and another person apply together for a 2-bed unit.\n\nI ended up asking Mina offhandedly where Kurt stays just to confirm, and she said he lives with her in her room. She asked me in a joking tone if I'd be \"hush hush\" about it because the leasing office doesn't know and this is the cheapest option for them with all the amenities they want until they get a house together, which  they're planning to purchase/finance in the spring when they're sure Mina is going to graduate. They're also apparently trying (or will start trying) for a baby because they're ready for a family.\n\nI'm upset and uncomfortable and I don't know what to do. I want to report Mina to the leasing office and get her removed, but I'm worried that even thought they're the ones breaking the rules that I might just be overreacting. I really don't like living with a grown man I don't know when I signed up to live with other girls, primarily in my age group. I was excited to move in with people that I wouldn't feel weird walking around in a sports bra and gym shorts, and being able to go to the fridge in the middle of the night for a snack in my underwear, and not having to lock the door every time I go in or leave my room, but I don't feel like I can do that with Kurt here. I've already caught him looking me up and down and I really don't want it to go past that and there be drama on top of all of this. Would I be the asshole if I just report the situation to my landlord?", "created_utc": 1692630894, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15xaisg/wibta_if_i_told_my_landlord_about_my_roommates/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And also mention that even if he were to leave, you wouldn't feel comfortable with Mina as a roommate once she knew you were the one who mentioned it.

Also, you and Layla are paying Kurt's rent.", "NTA\n\nThis doesn't fly for so many reasons. First, you're uncomfortable. Second, you're probably getting shafted on how the rent is getting split. Third, Mina didn't disclose this beforehand to get y'alls grace. Report her if you want.\n\nWhat does your other roommate think about this?", "NTA\n\nLiving with a married couple is not what you signed up for. Living with a male roommate is not what you signed up for. \nYou didn't even sign up to live with 3 other people. You chose this place based on the premise that you would have two roommates,  both of them women. \n\nReport away. It sucks for them but they are the ones who decided that it was ok to violate the terms of her tenancy and expected to magically get housed with TWO women who would be fine with an unexpected 4th roommate and with that roommate being a grown ass man.\n\nINFO- Have you told your parents about this situation? I don't know how your parents feel about interfering and fighting your battles but if you were my daughter,  I might very well take the decision out of your hands by raising hell with the leasing office myself.", "NTA!  That's super sketchy.  You shouldn't have to live with a 25yo stranger man after being tricked into the situation.", "NTA\n\nThat is not what the tenant rules or lease allows and was presented under false pretense.\n\nYou should not be forced to cohabitate with a random dude, especially when he's being a creeper", "NTA. Mina is going to think YTA, but you are definitely NTA. Its weird enough you don't get to pick who you are living, throwing a random dude in a single-sex apartment is unacceptable.", "NTA. Don't blame you for not wanting to have to worry about having a man in your apartment when he's not supposed to be there. I understand they're trying to save money, but they're also breaking the rules. You pretty much have three choices and that's either move out, deal with it, or report them.  They all suck in my opinion but you gotta do what's best for you.", "I'm going with NTA, because you chose to live in a single-sex apartment, and that's not what you got. Someone's boyfriend staying over from time to time is not at all the same as someone's husband living there.", "NTA.. have you talked to your other roommate? But this isn't appropriate she should know that other woman would feel uncomfortable.", "Nta can you tell the leasing office anonymously? At 18 living with a guy isn\u2019t fair when you looked for specifically female roommates.  I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable at that age, plus it isn\u2019t fair your paying the same amount but she\u2019s added an extra person.", "NTA. \nYou should report it. If they find out he's there and no-one has said anything you could all get thrown our. \n\nMina is definitely an AH for putting you in this situation in the first place. the should be out on their own in their own place.

You did not agree to live with him and you shouldn\u2019t have to.

My college senior son unfortunately signed a lease with another guy for a 3 bedroom place, another friend of the guy was supposed to move into the third bedroom but changed his mind. My son's roommate's mother (who visited the college for football games) said she'd pay \"a little extra\" for the third bedroom and she'd use it just for weekends. Turns out she MOVED INTO THAT BEDROOM, got a job at the university, and brought her 4 dogs (not allowed). My son protested but she and her son threatened him that they'd just ditch the apartment and leave him stuck with the lease. Since my son had a full load of classes plus a paid internship he was too stressed out to find another place to live so he sucked it up and just stayed in his bedroom most of the time. It was an awful experience.  OP at least you have your own lease and it is NOT your responsibility to protect the rule-breaking roommate.", "NTA. That's something she should have disclosed to you.\n\nMaybe you could try telling the leasing agent that you're not comfortable with your roommates, without specifying why, but if they won't move you without a reason then you wouldn't be an AH to tell them.\n\nGive your roommate a heads-up first. Tell her you're going to try to get moved, and that it's possible that the reason why will come up, although you'll try not to report her. That will give her time to make other arrangements.\n\nThey know they're doing something wrong, and that's not on you.", "NTA. Mina is breaking the rules and wants you all to be complicit. Report this situation to the housing department immediately so things can be sorted out as soon as possible. Mina and Kurt will have to find a new place", "NTA. I lived in a similar apartment in college. I say this in the nicest way possible\u2026 you are overthinking everything. \n\nFirst, the surveys are great but they ignore them the majority of the time. The hardest thing for freshman to learn is that your roomate isn\u2019t automatically your best friend. Sometimes they turn out to be and it\u2019s awesome. Sometimes they are the most aggravating person you\u2019ve ever met. Most of the times they\u2019re your buddy to events at the start of the year and then you drift apart but remain cordial as you each find your own clubs and friend groups. \n\nThis is important in your case because it doesn\u2019t seem like you knew Layla or Mina before this. In a week it\u2019s hard to tell the kind of person someone is. It\u2019s okay to bring up the situation casually to Layla but be prepared for her to tell Mina you mentioned it and possibly blame you if only Kurt gets kicked out. This situation isn\u2019t okay and needs to be resolved so I\u2019m not saying ignore the situation. Just be careful about who you pick to share it with. \n\nClasses are about to/have recently started so it\u2019s important to get this resolved now before your workload builds up. If you wait too long, there is also a possibility that the landlord will view you as an accomplice (because you knew and didn\u2019t come forward) which can affect your current lease/ability to renew for future terms. \n\nThe first thing you need to do is let your parents know. From what you\u2019ve said, they seem very supportive and they can help you navigate the situation. If they\u2019re a co-signer on the lease they may be able to handle a lot of the communication without your help so you can focus on school. It can also give you an excuse if Mina/Kurt say anything. (Aka blame your parents if needed to keep the apartment civil for you). \n\nThen send an email to whoever handles issues at the complex (probably a management company). Putting it in writing is important and you can copy your parents as well. Once that is sent, your parents can call for follow ups and to make sure the situation gets handled quickly (I say your parents because you don\u2019t want to be overheard by your roommates. Also, which it sucks, some management companies take calls from parents more seriously than from students). \n\nSome people might recommend taking to the front office. I would get the ball rolling through e-mail first. This is because many times, it\u2019s fellow students who have the front desk jobs. Since it\u2019s Mina\u2019s second year there and fifth year at the school, you don\u2019t know if the students at front know her.\n\nI\u2019d find ways to steer clear of Kurt until this is resolved. Lock the door to your room at all times. Many campuses have back to school events for freshman so go out and make some friends! They\u2019re usually lots of fun. \n\nBest of luck with everything!", "NTA!! Mina did a bad and deceptive thing. Not your fault. Definitely inform the landlord.", "NTA you should give her an ultimatum-move out or you report them. If they have an on-site caretaker or maintenance, I guarantee they will figure it out and they'll be evicted. Trying to rent with an eviction on your record is difficult. \n\n  Definitely talk to your other roommate about this. It will be better to present a united front.", "NTA. He's not on the lease, they're trying to get around the rules that keep people safe. Also it could be a fire code violation (my state has a one heartbeat per room rule unless the kids are under a certain age). Also, what if you don't say anything, she gets knocked up, then you've got a couple plus a new baby? Mina needs to leave and get her life straight. Go to the leasing office, and maybe ask for an inspection- say something is broken and you'd want maintenance to come look at it. Easy way to get off the hook if maintenance sees them. Then even if you do report it, they won't really know who did.", "NTA and you should definetely report Mina.  \nYou did everything right and applied to a place you would feel safe and have peace of mind while staying there and they are the ones breaking the rules and abussing the system.\n\nYou may end up looking at the \"bad person\" in their eyes but you are defenitely not, just take care of yourself and make sure you are happy with your living situation.", "Yeah as mentioned go ask for a different room. If ones not available & you report this extreme violation, I highly suggest you do so in the most discreet way you can. No you're not the or a asshole but you, if reported need to be as quite as possible.", "No, you would not be an asshole for reporting the situation. In fact - they need to know because if the leasing company finds out, and the fact that you didn\u2019t say anything, (it won\u2019t look good for you) you already mentioned how he was looking you up and down.. what else do you need? Turn them in and live the way it was supposed to be, without paying for a freeloader to live there\u2026 NTA", "YTA - When you get a roommate the expectation is that they'll potentially one day bring a partner home", "NAH. Nobody wants to see you in your underwear at night though, male or female. So please just put on a robe.", "Any time you make someone homeless when they have done you no harm, you're the asshole.\n\nThe appropriate thing to do if you're uncomfortable with having a man in your apartment is move out yourself.", "Nta but pretty sexist. You wouldn't lock your door around Mina but you would for her husband? That's a little weird. To me, but you are supposed to know with whom you're moving in and you didn't consent to this situation", "1: it's highly unlikely your roommate would be evicted, likely just given a warning.\n\n2. It will ruin your relationship with that roommate if not your other one, too\n\n3. If you should get a bf/gf and want them to stay the night, then be prepared to be reported \n\nIf Kurt is just minding his business then chill, if he gives you reason to feel uncomfortable then by all means report him but your roommate has the right to have a relationship and I certainly know of plenty of people in relationships that their SO technically has their own place but just never goes home and this is just one step removed from this.\n\nIt's inadvisable but technically allowable, but I'd say YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They're also taking that apartment away from another student that probably needs it more.", "Or they can kick Mina and her husband out out and give her an opportunity to collect her belongings, supervised by management, at an agreed date in the next few weeks.", "I'd feel too confrontational approaching things this way, but that may be what I need to do. I'm afraid to come off too strong, I don't have a lot of experience with dealing with confrontation head-on and I'm afraid I'll shrink and turn into a doormat if I get intimidated. If I do decide to go this route, I think I'll need one or both of my parents with me, but I also really don't want to stress them out with all of this. I'll figure it out, though.\n\nAlso, might not be super important, but I wouldn't even be able to simply request a room change since the apartment complex is at full capacity. My university over-enrolled this year, and you can't request a room change if there are no free rooms available, even if you can find someone else who also wants to swap.", "Last sentence. How is it your responsibility to finance their married life? This is a violation of their lease.

I'm going to ask her later.\n\nAlso, about rent, we all have separate leases. We essentially lease our bedrooms, so we're all charged the same rate. So even if Layla also had a husband living with her, or if Kurt suddenly disappeared, I would still be paying the same rate. I'm not really torn up about whether Mina getting to split rent is \"fair\" or if I'm getting shafted. If anything I'd assume they feel cramped. Two people are sharing the bedroom/bathroom for a single person and the fridge/freezer/pantry space of one person. That would suck too much for me to bring in a secret roommate to cut my costs, unless I was living in the cheapest place and still couldn't afford it.", "That's so true about the rent! Hadn't thought of that, but sharing common spaces with 3 other people is def not the same as sharing with 2, even if they only use 1 bedroom.", "I haven't told them yet. They know Mina is married but not that Kurt lives in her room. I know my mom would take a more restrained, but still very stern, kind of approach. My father would probably lose his shit.

My roommates and their activities or rent etc etc is not my responsibility. A lot of places here are only offering joint leases or something similar.\n\nI'm going to be asking Layla how she feels later.", "yeah, I might go to Layla and see if she's on the same page so you can both go to Mina and basically give her a chance to fix this before you both go to the management company. But I agree- this is a situation where one no is enough no's.", "I'm not against my roommates bringing their partners over. Layla's bf visits every weekend. But he doesn't live her. Kurt does.

What. The. Fuck. No roommate gets to add someone to a house - a single gender house, no less - unilaterally.", "That was to illustrate how I'm not comfortable, not that I would regularly walk around underdressed. \n\nMy point is more that if I rolled out of bed at 3am or something and wanted a snack, I'd fully cover up on the off chance that Kurt is up late gaming. But I wouldn't be uncomfy if one of the girls accidentally saw me for a moment in a sports bra/tank top and boxer shorts/athletic shorts. \n\nTypically I would grab a robe anyway, because I still don't know if these girls would care at all about accidentally seeing a bit more thigh or some stomach.

The only availabilities for rooms in my area are more expensive than I'm already paying by at least $100/month. In addition, I have to pay %50 of any remaining rent payments to break my lease, and I lose my security deposit. The application fee is also non-refundable, and applying to other places will cost more money.

What part of 'not co-ed' do you (and Mina) not understand? Kurt and Mina are breaking the rules and need to leave.", "Me being uneasy about living and sleeping in the same house/apartment as an adult man that I don't know isn't sexist. 1 in 5 college girls are sexually assaulted. 1 in 6 women are the victim of an attempted or completed sexual assault in their life time.\n\nEven if those weren't very real issues and concerns for me to have, I did not sign up to live with a man, point blank. I signed a lease and pay rent/utilities to live with two other college girls. I also didn't sign up to live with an infant, which is also potentially in my future since they're planning/trying for their first kid.", "A partner staying the night is allowed in the lease and I have 0 issue with it. Layla's bf visits every weekend and stays overnight on Saturdays. That's fine. Kurt LIVES in Mina's room, which is not allowed.\n\nThe rule for our place is one overnight guest per tenant, one night per week. I wouldn't care if one of them had two overnight guests or a bf over for two nights now and then instead of one. Not a huge deal. Kurt full on living there is a problem a huge lease violation that's been going on since Mina moved in a year ago. I think with that in mind, the office would take it more seriously and evict Mina. \n\nThe other issue is, as I said in the post, Kurt isn't really \"minding his business and chilling\". He's checking me out and making me uncomfortable.", "You would benefit from writing down the problem and what you want the final situation to look like. Maybe your preferred solution is that Mina & husband both move out while the less desirable option is that her husband no longer lives there but Mina still does. Next, practice saying what you think is necessary (obv. not in the apt). Not aggressively but in a matter of fact way. It'll give you the opportunity to hear how it sounds and more importantly, you'll get used to saying those words so when you sit with the office people, you're confident in what you're saying.\n\nGood luck!", "Ah, that makes sense. I'd say, report if your mind is set on it, but definitely test the waters with how Layla feels.", "At the end of all of this, reporting Mina's lease violation to the office is the least dramatic thing to do. This puts the conflict between Mina and the office, where it belongs. Every 'softer' option puts the conflict between you and Mina. Or pits your father against the office, which could have negative consequences for you, the one who signed the lease and lives there.\n\nIf you want out of it completely, you may inform the office about what's going on *and* request that if possible you be offered a new room in a different apartment. This will depend on availability, but it gets you away from Mina and her husband while the office does whatever they feel appropriate.", "You are doing nothing wrong, it isn\u2019t fair to be put in this position. How do the other girls feel about this?  \n\nI would tell them and be prepared to move out or report her if she retaliates.", "Will you feel ok if he is there every day, and just goes home to sleep for couple hours?\n\nIt wont fix your problems, which is strange man in apartment.", "As I said, you're within your rights to report him and I can't make a judgment on him \"checking you out\" outside of how you feel...I'd just advise you that Mina isn't going away.\n\nKurt might after a report, but it's costly and time intensive to evict someone, whether theyre on the leaae or not. Without a very good reason (and unfortunately, you feeling uncomfortable isn't much of one), a property management company isn't going to spend that money and effort.\n\nAs much as I don't want to pull this card either but being as young as you are doesn't help.
